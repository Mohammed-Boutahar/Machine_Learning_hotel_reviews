This is my 3rd time here. The staff delivers a very hi level of service in every regard, without exception. I was even impressed that the fitness room is very well cared for and cleaned. (unusual!) The challenge here is that this hotel is probably 40-45 years old and its age shows. We were here two years ago and the elevator bank was being renovated. The elevator bank is still being renovated! However, they devote two staff people to directing traffic to help people in and out quickly, and they even have one person operating the elevator (what a throwback). There is a memo on the desk in our room warning that you better leave extra time due to likely elevator delays, so this is clearly not a plus. Several times, there was no room for people on lower floors to get on :(  Another;4
The hotel was clean, but the room was so small that you almost had to step in the shower to close the bathroom door. They don't provide free internet to there customers. They charge $2.99 a day for internet. The pool was small, but on there website it looked much larger.;4
"I stay at Hilton brand hotels exclusively.  I am a gold member, which in most Hilton brand hotels, it allows for a complimentary breakfast in the morning.    I was surprised to be asked to pay for a supposed upgrade to the breakfast.  So, this hotel uncharges you from the supposed Executive Breakfast.  So the Executive breakfast is basically a little area in the end of the buffet line.  I stood in the omelet line, which I was then asked by the waiter if I wanted to order from that side it was a ""$10"" upgrade.  I didn't feel like arguing, so I said OK.  The upgrade is actually 10.99, not a big deal.  I just like to be told the right amounts.  I looked over to the Executive breakfast area and I didn't see anything on there but a few yogurts and basic breakfast fruits.  Like I";4
We booked and paid well in advance for four nights on Expedia.  As the stay approached I wanted to cancel based on the reviews but couldn't as we had prepaid.  However I had nothing to worry about as the hotel did absolutely everything that we needed it to do.  Parking is expensive so I parked on the street on Vermont Place (right next to the hotel) where parking was free from 20:00 to 08:00.  We were out all day so this did not cause us a problem.  On a mornign I went and put one hours parking on the car before we had breakfast which cost very little.  Parking was free all day Sunday.  One day had overnight street cleaning so watch out for this.  Pull onto the ramp to load/unload baggage then park up.  Our room was a little tired but a decent size and comforatbel with air con,;4
We stayed at the Days Inn on 94th and Broadway for four nights.  This was our second experience staying at this hotel.  Our room was much larger this time as it was a corner room and just as clean as the time before.  There were NO BEDBUGS.  One bank of elevators is rather old but we avoid using them and always catch the newer ones. The Days Inn is close to the subway, Central Park and a great restaurant for breakfast, Key West.  When we go to NYC, we are hardly ever in the room except to sleep because there is so much to see and do so this works perfectly.    I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean place to stay, close to the subway and doesn't need all the amenities of an expensive hotel.;4
We stayed here during our recent trip to California. Hotel is virtually next door to Universal Studios which is what we wanted to do and were able to walk in the morning to. It has nice ambience  in the entry hall and couple of nice restaurants for food as well. Parking is available onsite but comes at an added extra cost. Has a pool which is kids friendly but is outside, however it does have water that is temperature controlled. Our room was decent size & looked modern. However i must say, carpet in the room looked dirty & not upto the mark. They do not provide slippers for stay, so be prepared to have your shoes on unless you are happy to walk on dirty carpet. Staff was nice and cheerful, buffet breakfast had lots of options of food but is pricey. One thing to note is the;4
Great welcome followed by a room upgrade to celebrate a 10th year wedding anniversary. Good room the aircondition was very noisy took a few days getting used to. Pasquale was exceptional when it came to sorting out a charge issue. He listened when another colleague could not find  the error or acknowledging there was a problem! All in all extremely pleasant trip to NYC.;4
I stayed here in November '03. It is an older hotel, so the decor/furniture/bathroom/elevators are not the greatest but we didn't have any major problems, and in NYC for less than $100/nt, it was to be expected. The best part of the hotel is the location-- only a few blocks from an express subway stop so you can be in Times Square/Theater District in two stops. There are a lot of places to eat nearby, and Central Park is only a few blocks away. I would definitely stay there again.;4
We stayed here in March for 5 nights, the location is perfect for NYC- easy to get to everywhere and a metro very close by. Only reason this is not a 5/5 is because the rooms could do with an update (although not a major problem as we didnât spend much time in the room) and the shower head was so powerful it hurt!! We would stay again.  Also, we booked through Virgin Holidays and therefore did not have to pay the additional fee people have mentioned on here.;4
This was the almost-perfect base for our first time experiencing Halloween Horror Nights. I say almost-perfect due to a couple of hiccups stemming from having to book two separate nights (one was a free night certificate and the other was paid out of pocket). Basically, the mobile key stopped working after the first night, which also affected us exiting the parking garage.  Otherwise, it was a great stay. I thoroughly enjoy the ability to select your room through the Hilton app the day before you arrive. I was able to snag a high floor with an excellent view of the valley. We even got an early notification that our room was ready around 1pm.  Our single king room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom felt upscale with our complimentary toiletry items nicely presented on the;4
It is a boutique hotel. The rooms are a bit small, but they are new and very clean. They must have remodeled recently because the room I stayed in was impeccable.  The staff was extremely friendly and the location is great! Right in Lincoln Center. The beds are great! So comfortable. The mini-bar has a lot of things, but extremely expensive. There is a Duane Reade (a common drug store) around the corner, so if you want to have snacks or drinks, just buy everything there.;4
I booked this hotel because of its great location, but would stay again because of the fabulous service.  From the doorman to the bell hop, front desk staff, concierge and bar staff, I was treated almost royally.  All of the staff were very solicitous, always acknowledging me and asking if there was anything I needed.  When I told the bell hop I wanted to go over to Universal Studios (5 minutes away) before the complimentary shuttle began running, he had the hotel limo drive me right up to the main entrance and, the first evening a waiter delivered a tray of fruit, candy and cookies to my room.  Those little extras definitely made me feel like a special and welcome guest.  The accommodations more than lived up to expectations.  I booked a King Alcove Room and had a gorgeous;4
Fabulous boutique hotel in a great location.  Staff was extremely knowledgeable about the city and very helpful.  Conveniently located in by Lincoln centre close to performing arts, restaurants and Central Park.;4
Our room was perfect for the 3 of us. We had an alcove with a couch besides the 2 double beds. Our granddaughter slept on the couch. Room 722. Amenities were good and great location for subways Restaurants were good especially coffee shop. Only problem we had was with our maid who kept forgetting to leave coffee. Had to call housekeeping.;4
Hotel was clean, quite and the gym was very handy for us. It is safe and close to other amenities. The breakfast is awesome. The chef, named Hugo, was so friendly and helpful. His serving was top notch.;4
Location is right by Penn station, which is fab for transport. Itâs also close to the Empire State Building.  The hotel has 3 restaurants- a 24hr diner, a steak and cocktail place and an Italian. All are amazing! The rooms are small and dated, this is what lets the place down. Disproportionate to the price for the room I felt. However, when I discussed this with guest services, they apologised and sent some complementary wine to the room which I thought was lovely. The staff were really nice.  Overall it was nice, but pricey, then again itâs New York!;4
I stayed at the Jane for four nights on a recent solo trip to New York and can't recommend it enough to others. The room was tiny, but I was expecting that and, really, it's New York! Who wants to hang out in a room here?! The room was well appointed and clean, the bottle of water, robe and slippers are such a nice touch. It did smell a little funny, I'm not sure what of, but I got used to it after the first night. My room was nice and quiet and I had no issues with nightclub music even over the weekend. It was warm, being summer, but the fan did the trick. I tried using the air conditioner but it was really loud so I didn't bother with it.  The bathrooms were nice and clean. Yes, there were a few partially clad people in and out of them, but it really didn't bother me! It is in;4
Nice hotel for a decent price, a short distance from a fairly sketchy area of the city, but itâs NY. What do you expect. Great view of the city from my room, excellent cleaning services provided. Lines were slow for both check-in and check-out. But the stay itself was very nice.;4
We stayed here for a 3 nights stay in November '11, the hotel is nice and staff friendly, could be a little be more well decorated. Breakfast must be improved. location is great.;4
"The hotels' team are awesome, beginning at front desk during check in to them again to checkout.Hotel goes on very recommendable, besides the a.m themes,added to localizatios and staff support.But, again, some maintenance problems must be improved to get a ""Excellent"" status for overall, in this stay the elevators showed us some problems, but nothing that can jeorpardize their goo status.";4
Overall, this place was very good, with just a couple of things that kept me from giving it an excellent rating.  We requested one of the higher rooms, so we could have a view, and it was worth every penny.  The room was surprisingly big, with a decent sized bed, and plenty of room around it.  There was a desk and chair, bedside drawers and wardrobe space.  The bathroom was a reasonable size, with a shower over the bath, wash hand basin, toilet and a cabinet with towels in.  The heating was fantastic, and believe me, with snow on the ground and the wind-chill factor, we certainly put it through its paces.  There was loads of hot water too.  The staff were polite, friendly and went out of their way to help.  After we checked out, we were able to store our bags there, for a dollar;4
I have never been one to put reviews on sites, I only read others, however I am compelled to write this after a very pleasant, week long stay, at Days inn, New York. My wife had booked us this trip for my 30th birthday and after finding out where we we're visiting I immediately took to this site and others to read reviews of this hotel. I really wish I hadn't, I was petrified, the things I read, the pictures I saw, this hotel looked awful and on leading up to our trip the only thing on my mind was the hotel! My wife had even looked into moving us but as it was NY fashion week, there was nothing else.  So we arrived, and yes there is scaffolding outside, but I wasn't in New York to look outside the hotel, I had plenty of other things to do. I have scaffolding outside my home at;4
"Small but cozy place in Upper West Side. I was there for Westminster so it was conveniently located and the online price was pretty good. I went in with pretty low expectations as I had never stayed there. I was please to be greeted (and helped throughout the stay) by very friendly door staff and very accommodating desk staff. The lobby was very warm and relaxing. Almost  a throwback to another time. I ended up with a king room with a view of a small park and Lincoln Center. Although it was on the ""first floor"" (not lobby level)  I noticed very little outside noise. The carpet and wall paprer were kind of interesting choices but very boutique hotel type. I thought it was different but cool. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable but low to the ground, as were the";4
Room was clean and comfortable. View from room window was wonderful, the Empire State Building straight in front and because it was close to Christmas was lit up like a present at night. Very centrally located, able to walk to attractions or take a taxi which were reasonably priced. Staff very helpful, pleasant and polite at all times. The attached Tick Tock restaurant served good , honest food with serving staff always having time for a smile and a chat. The doormen very good at procuring taxis outside the hotel.;4
Nice hotel, very convenient to universal studios. We stayed here last weekend because we had a wedding reception there. The hotel is clean and nice, there was issues with the elevators though which we had to go up, to come down from our floor. This was a bit of a pain in the butt. The pool was nice, the hot tub was ok. Many of the jets didn't work. I found it needed some upgrades. The staff was very friendly.;4
We stayed on level 11, I think that some floors have been renovated and some not.  Our room was totally renovated, very fresh and clean.  The only thing missing was the fridge.  There was a cupboard for it, but nothing in it!  I don't know if this was meant to be the case or not. I've stayed in NYC before, again on the Upper West Side and the location of this hotel is superior.  Like others have said, right near the subway, plenty of stores, banks, conveniences that you need within blocks of the hotel.  There is even a 24 hour drug store downstairs that stocks absolutely everything. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, a very small gym with a treadmill and such, but you're in New York.  If you want all of the added extras, you'll have to head downtown, stay at a chain hotel and;4
"My wife and I stayed here on 12/28/13 for one night.  We were cruising out of NYC the next day and I actually booked this ""blindly"" through Priceline.  We both were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel.  The room, which featured a queen bed, was well appointed, clean and seemed like it had been recently updated.  While small, we felt the room was great for a single night's stay.  We checked in early and were accommodated even though we were early.  They provided extra pillows for us and we ordered room service, which was delivered within 45 minutes and very good.  Lobby is a little dark, but still nice.  All in all, a good value for the money.";4
Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of January 2019, and we where very impressed, we had read a few reviews complaining about room size and heating, but being in the heart of Manhattan, we found it a comfortable size, and the heating was fine.. It is in a. Perfect location to explore NYC.. With so many attractions and landmarks within walking distance.. And subway Stations and taxis close by if you don't want to walk. Was very happy with front of house service and housekeeping, would stay here again.. Only dropped a star as no tea/coffee making facilities in room, but it is NYC, coffee is pretty readily available!;4
With our flight out of New York cancelled due to a snowstorm, and our prior hotel quadrupling the rate for an extra night, we found the Ameritania. It's a good value in the heart of everything -- clean rooms, small but not too small, and surprisingly quiet for an older building on Broadway. Jeff the bellman was super helpful getting us in during the storm, and arranging a ride out the next day.;4
Beautiful Art Deco hotel in a very central area of Manhattan, we were upgraded due to it being our daughters birthday to a room on the 33rd floor with views of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens from the other.  We had a perfect stay here.  Yes the bathroom is a bit smaller than most and there are extra charges but we were aware of this from the start and to be honest, who stays in their room any longer than needed in NYC?  The staff we encountered were very helpful, from checking us in to arranging a car to take us to the airport.  We ate in the Tick Tock diner a couple of times with no major problems. It was clean and the food was edible so all was good. We would come back here again for sure;4
This hotel is conveniently right next door to the airport  which is a blessing in disguise. It has regular buses servicing the terminals as the buses also pickup for a short and long term car parking facility next to the hotel. I got the hotel very early as I came in on an international flight that get in around 6.30am. So by time I get to hotel it's roughly around 8am. I ent to check in and didn't expect to get a room so early but they had one available and i was extremely grateful to get it and no extra fee like the Hilton charges. I had a road view and requested if I may get airport view which without a blink of an eye changed happily for me. The check in was fast, smooth. Seamless. I got to the room. The rooms are modern decor especially the lights and the rooms was a little;4
The hotel is more on the old side, but it's not bad at all. The security is so overrated. That they don't know the limit, but besides that, my stay was okay. The customer service is terrific. Everything gets taken care of very fast when you ask for something, so for that, I would come back when I need to be in that area!!;4
Room was great, location was great, food was great, parking was great, what not to like about this hotel? We were happy about it. Near to universal city, just take the stairs/bridge and you're there. Great!;4
My wife and I stayed here at the start of a West to East tour of the US.  Diamond HH member but it was a Saturday night and holiday weekend so no upgrades available - fair enough.   Room was comfortable enough and easy Uber/Lyft to and from Hollywood Boulevard and also to Burbank airport ahead of our flight to Vegas the following morning.  Decent breakfast as well.  Thank you.;4
Without the kids in tow we were spending a  day at Universal.  Hotel is immediately adjacent to the park entrance - it is quicker to walk than take the courtesy shuttle.   Large shiny hotel - you wonât miss it, underground parking with lots of elevators to the lobby.   Checking was a breeze, helpful polite staff and a smooth process.   We had a corner room on the 14th floor - stunning view towards Burbank. Everything worked, everything was pretty new or recently refurbished - apart from the coffee machine which the staff replaced in about 5 minutes once notified. Shower pressure could be a little higher though.   The hotel gets a five, but after a meal in the restaurant I feel I have to give a 4 overall. Cool food lacking flavor was presented , in fairness once pointed out the;4
Look for a room with view on hudson not the one with shared bath. Doormen are funny and very pleasant. They help you for every need. It's close to real life of Chelsea. Don't forget to take a ride with free jane bike;4
It is 100 yards from the subway.  From there, with the 1, you can connect with most connections.  Just clip the metro map from any of the tourist guide, and you can get ANYWHERE by hopping the subway.   30 bucks will get you unlimitted rides on buses and subways for 7 days, worth it if you are here more than 3 days.    Hotel is right in the corner of Broadway, and 94 street.  You can walk down to the Hudson river, it is about 1/2 mile to reach the path that goes under the road, but well worth the walk.  About 1/4 mile to Central Park, and just a little bit longer to Nat Sci Museum.  Cross the park and you are at the Art Museum.      Yes, part of the hotel is old and run down.  But the upper levels are remodeled.   Depending on how you booked your hotel, cheap price will get you;4
My husband and I spent 8 days in NY during February. We booked this hotel because of the price (was between 20 - 40 USD less than other budget hotels) and the location (it is just across the street from Central Park and three blocks from the subway). The rooms are fine, a little bit small, but then, if you are going to NY, you probably won't spend much time in your room. You will have a comfortable and clean bed a private bath and a properly heated (sometimes even too much) room for a really convenient price. The people in the front desk and the doorman are very nice and always willing to help and to provide advice. The only thing I would have liked is to have free Internet. There is wi-fi available, but you have to pay for it. I would definetily go back to this hotel.;4
My last stay was just as I expected. Nice room, good value, easy check in and check out. Definitely a go-to for quick business travel. One downfall is that at least one elevator seems to be out during each stay. But overall a very good stay.;4
Hotel Empire is a clean, friendly hotel in the heart of Lincoln Center,close to Ballet, Opera, Central Park. Due to its location it gets a bit noisy at night but otherwise very well maintained with trendy decor.;4
Like a LIGHTHOUSE in the sky, with the EMPIRE and THE CHRYSLER BUILDING, the New Yorker, today changed to the WINDHAM NEW YORKER HOTEL is a very excelent option to be in NEW YORK. Not cheap, because the price of the HOTELS in NYC are veryyy expensive but...HUGE and NICE!!!;4
Great location, but not cheap. Staff is much friendlier than before. There was a roach in my room, but when I told the staff, she quickly apologized and moved me to another (upgraded) room. It's  New York City, so I expect critters.;4
Great hotel in a great location, only issue we had was checking in which was resolved quickly but we found some of the staff were not as polite and  welcoming as they were when we stayed with them before.;4
Overall very good for our girls trip! Our first room had a broken AC which made the first couple nights very uncomfortable and hot. Bathroom was on small side. However, the manager quickly fixed the issue and upgraded us to a lovely suite with more space to make up for our first couple nights with poor quality sleep. The manager was very kind and understanding with the issue. Service was overall exemplary, and staff were very kind and respectful. Pool and rooftop bar have great views of the city. Location is convenient as close to Central Park and subway station. Would recommend Empire Hotel!;4
I'm giving this place a good rating opposed to average for a few reasons. The rooms themselves are definitely on the needs updating end of the spectrum, especially the tiny television with weird reception. That being said the actual room was always clean, and our shower was strong and hot. The room was cold at first, but since I live in an older building myself I realized they just had the radiators closed, it was fine actually a little too warm after that. The location itself was a big plus for me. The subway was a block and a half away for the b, and d trains and about four blocks either east or west for the 1,2. There were tons of restaurants on Columbus and Broadway and at much more reasonable prices than you'd find midtown. I guess depending on your comfort on public;4
Nice hotel, good service and good food too!  It's wonderful to be right at the park.  The hotel is a bit dated but still very nice. The elevators were slow though.  Parking was ample and easy to get too.;4
We stayed two nights using Hilton Honors points. Self-parking was $17 per night, which we expected given this is L.A. The hotel location was convenient to the highway system and also the original Big Boy restaurant in Burbank, which was on our list of places to eat.  Pros: The room was clean and quiet. No highway noise though our room faced the highway.  Complimentary fruit basket, happy hour appetizers, and continental breakfast were much appreciated.  Cons: Front desk check-in clerk was brusque with us. She also neglected to give us our complimentary breakfast and happy hour appetizer coupons. We only learned about them the next day when another staff member called our room to tell us they were waiting for us at the front desk.  Elevators seemed to take a long time to arrive.;4
The hotel is located next to Universal Studios and is suitable for the studio visitors. The car parking is very convenient but should be  paid by the guest 30 USD per day, the breakfast  is very tasty and the rooms are large and comfortable, the shower is comfortable but in old design, The hotel is different from the other Hilton hotels I visited as it  does not includes  bathrobes,  slippers and  free bottled water however after I demanded it, they gave it.  May be it given only for high  class of rooms while  in other Hilton I visited it given to all class of rooms.;4
The service at the front desk was excellent. Itâs proximity to Universal Studios is convenient. The rooms are comfortable but in need of a facelift. Our non-smoking room smelled of cigarettes. We bring a portable air purifier when we travel so we were able to get rid of the smell. Showers flood the bathroom floor a little when we shower. The door seal not working?  Overall pleasant enough stay.;4
The room was clean, the staff was very polite and helpful. Lovely receptionists were at their best, so much of assistance. God bless them. Quite and a lovely restaurant with a lovely atmosphere. Pity the stay was too short.;4
Arriving from a 15 hour flight at 10am we were able to check into our room early, which was appreciated as we were desperate for a shower and some sleep. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Our room was large and clean, and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was a little on the small side, but this was no big deal. We had a balcony facing out to a quiet street. It would have been nice if there was a couple of seats on the balcony.  The included breakfast is great with a good choice of cereals, breads and pastries and juices and coffee/tea. Or if you are not in a hurry you can line up for freshly cooked Omelets with fillings of choice, plus delicious fluffy waffles.   The location of the Hotel is not close to Hollywood Blvd by walking, however there;4
The hotel is amazing and the bartender Javier made our evening incredible! Call for his cosmopolitans!  The hotel room is confortable , near everything, close to a statbucks where we always toke our breakfeast!!!;4
To start off, I have stayed at this hotel probably at least 4 times.  Recently, I read some really negative reviews, so I was SUPER nervous about staying here.  The reviews talked about the non functioning elevators and lack of hot water in the showers, mold in the bathrooms, etc, etc.  To put things in perspective, the rate of my room minus taxes, etc was around $245 a night which is incredibly GOOD in NYC.  Yes, the rooms are tiny, but that is what you get for that price in NYC.  The rooms were clean, adequate hot water (all contingent on the time of your shower) and good service.  I stayed in an interior room which you will want in NYC at this type of hotel, or you won't sleep due to the car noise outside.  I stayed here for business.  I wouldn't personally stay here for;4
"After reading both sides of the story, I must say that the stay this past weekend at Morningside was absolute wonderful. Patrick- front desk was the greatest with hotel assistance and suggestions for sight seeing and other places.  Morningside Inn is a great for those travelers who just need it for one purpose ""sleep"".... especially with the hustling and bustling of shopping and sightseeing within a 24-48 hr duration. The location was perfect for taxi drives downtown and close walk to the central park. We drove from DC and found a parking spot on 107th a few feet away from the Morningside and use subways, taxi and good ole  ""pat & turn"" walking. Kudos!";4
A reliable, dependable choice in a convenient location just a walk away from the Universal Studios theme park and a 10-15 minute drive from other major attractions such as the Getty Museum, Griffith Park, Hollywood and downtown LA. A short walk from the hotel and you have the clean and reliable metro red line train service as well. The only slight criticism would be that the 1980s decor could probably do with a revamp and charges for using the business centre internet were a little steep. One of the great joys of staying here is sitting poolside sipping a Margarita on a warm, mellow LA afternoon - something I could get used to doing on a regular basis.;4
This hotel seems to have great price for the area.  You pay extra for parking, and the place isn't cheap...but it seems to be a good value.  Good place to stay for Universal, of course, but also good for anyone going to TV tapings or any studio tours.  They are all pretty close by.  The beds here are very comfortable.  The staff wasn't exactly helpful, but they weren't rude.  They pretty much stay out of the way.;4
First let's get the negative points out of the way. Yes, the lift is slow and sometimes it is easier to use the stairs. Some of the rooms are small, but all are clean and each bathroom is decorated to a high standard, the hotel having been refurbished in 2005. The individual air conditioning units fitted in each room are effective but a little noisy. There are no other facilities at the hotel apart from the bedrooms, a reception area and a drinks machine and Internet station (expensive) in the basement.   Now the positive points about this friendly small hotel. It is well placed on Central Park West and is very reasonably priced. The staff all tended to be friendly and helpful and were happy to engage in conversation and offer advice on places to go and things to see. The hotel;4
We have stayed here twice now in the last 10 years when visiting New York and both times have enjoyed our stay. The hotel is an ideal base for a trip here with the rooms being basic but clean, tidy and comfortable. I would recommend to ask for a central park facing room as the view is great. The staff were very helpful and friendly and our room was cleaned daily. It is a great base to explore NYC with subways 100 yds away in both directions and only 10 mins to get in to time square. They dont do breakfast but there is a deli 2 block away that provides fantatsic BLTs and cream cheese bagels! If you dont fancy being awake until 3 am like in times square this hotel is perfect. The wifi worked fine and was enough to skype our family back in the UK. They do have coffee machines in;4
We stayed at the Astor on the Park in New York for nearly a week in February 2014. The room was very clean and well kept, bed sheets changed every day, as needed soaps, shampoo and towels, has a flat screen TV with cable. It is not luxury but if your goal is to enjoy New York for a very moderate price, than Astor is a good place. Our room had a great view of Central Park, which you may get if you ask.  Area is safe and has plenty of small grocery and eating places. Great deli next door for breakfast with a Turkish flavour.Convenient bus lines are near by. Elevator is small and a bit slow but that is a minor item to us. We appreciated also the friendlly and helpful attitude.;4
Great location,excellent staff, close to Subway and many shops and restaurants Great rooftop Bar, rooms are really small, comfortable bed,lower floor rooms have no issue with noise.star bucks is very close.  A bit pricey !!;4
We spent the night on the way home from Australia and was very pleased with the Hotel. They have shuttles that run every 15 minutes or so which makes it very convenient to LAX. The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable and the hotel amenities were very nice. Highly recommend if you need a place near LAX.;4
I spent two nights at the Empire last week and found the hotel's location very convenient (C-line is right across the street at Lincoln Center) my needs - a medical meeting at Columbia, an investors meeting in Connecticut, and investor meetings in mid-town. Room was comfortable, and there was a good breakfast on the Mezzanine level (which I missed on my first day). Good restaurants are in the area. Staff was friendly and responsive. I would stay here again. For those who need WiFi, there was a good (and free) WiFi set up here.;4
Just steps away from universal studios,this large hilton served to our needs.  walk distance to Universal Studios and City Walk, minutes away by car from Burbank and Hollywood.;4
We stayed at the hotel in August and used it for our base to visit La and Universal studios. The hotel is in a great location 5 mins walk to Universal and within easy driving distance of Hollywood and most other Places you would want to visit in la. We had breakfast each morning in the hotel which was nice.;4
I read about The Jane a couple of years ago and put it on my list of places to try. I stay in all sorts of places and don't mind spending money when I get the utility (I flew BA Club Class this trip to NYC) but I don't like spending money on a large room in NYC that I'll just sleep in.  The Jane is nearly perfect in this regard. It was cheap for NYC (I paid $100 a night) which compares to The Pod Hotel I've stayed in before and even run-down flea pits like The Larchmont. Bearing in mind the new Yotel here is about $300 a night and The Jane is a bargain.  But you get what you pay for. The single room is tiny as everyone on here notes so I wasn't surprised. But there was enough storage space above and below the bed to keep my stuff out of the way. I couldn't work out what was;4
We have a family of 6 and is was difficult to find a place for all of us to stay without booking 2 hotel rooms.  The Tempo apartments was a great option for us.  We were in a safe part of New York City (Upper West Side).  A subway station was right around the corner with another up a few blocks.  It was also very easy to get a cab on Broadway (less than a block away).    There were nice restaurants and groceries available within walking distance.    A staff member was very helpful helping us arrange a ride to the airport.;4
"We were going on a cruise out of LA and decided to stay in LA and visit Universal Studios for a couple of days.  I booked the Hilton due to the convenient location and I'm also a HiltonHonors member.  Have to admit it didn't start out great.  We were checking in and I was waiting in the HiltonHonors line and the desk attendant acted like I was invisible and was going to help the person in the regular line not the Honors line and the acted like, ""oh"" thought you were those other people. Which clearly I wasn't, I was not even standing close to them.  So that didn't get us to a good start.  So then she started to help us then because I forgot to bring my AAA card, (to get the better rate) she pawned me off on the manager on duty.  Instead of just doing what he could to do help with";4
Good location!  Very convenient to visit museum, Central Park, and many theaters. But a little expensive. I stayed this hotel 2 times. I will book and stay Ameritania at Times Square for my next visit to New York City.;4
Choose this hotel because of it's proximity to Penn Station since we took the train from DC.  It's close to Times Square, theater district, Empire State, Macy's, restaurants, shopping and the subway.    The hotel is old but well preserved for the most part.  Historical spot that has maintained it's relevance.  Service is over top excellent at every encounter.  Tic Tock Restaurant is a great 24/7 diner. Amenities include a well equipped up to date fitness center.  Our room was your typical small NY queen but it was comfortable enough and met our expectations.  I would stay here again.;4
Stayed here for a four night city break and we were totally impressed. The room was a metro small room but more an adequate for two of us. The service charge was a bit of a disappointment considering we only used the room as a basis and were not intending to use any facilities. No coffee or tea making facilities in the room, again should be with the service charge. A small problem with the smell of smoke from another residents room, however reception staff quickly responded and issue resolved. The hotel is a little tired but nothing serious. Staff very help and security very good. Tick tock restaurant good value and again helpful staff. Hotel excellent location very near the train station. On the whole would recommend and stay again.;4
New Yorker is my favorite NYC hotel with inexpensive prices for very clean rooms, friendly staff & the ease of being next to Moynahan & PENN station. Its in the middle of Manhattan within walking distance of anything you need & the Hudson River. Anything you need in the hotel a call away & everyone I have ever come across was friendly & willing to help in my many stays over the years. Room service is provided by the Tick Tock Diner & itâs open 24/7. Most of the rooms are updated yet still feature the unique Art Deco decor which was so popular when the hotel was built. The TV & cable arenât that great yet if your going to NYC to watch TV, well enjoy.;4
The accommodations at the Hilton hotel were as expected. The room was a little smaller than I am used to, but not a deal breaker. The buffet style dinner was excellent in every respect except the actual food service area. The buffet was so large it spilled out into the hotels walkway from the parking garage to the rooms. Getting your food became quite tricky while trying to dodge the folks just getting back to the hotel. The food was excellent, though, and the service was terrific. If you want to spend the day at Universal Studios, I would not hesitate to book a room the previous night and enjoy the accommodations, food, and short shuttle ride to the park.;4
I enjoyed most aspects of this stay. The staff was excellent, the room was clean and the hotel is in an excellent location. We were a leisurely 15 minute walk from Times Square and our Broadway show, MSG is across the street and there is Subway access north and south without crossing the street. I didn't appreciate how pushy the Wyndham desk rep was when I mistakenly thought he was the concierge. He tried to psuh tour tickets and a dinner package on me repeatedly even after I told him I was looking for the concierge. Also, there is a kiosk with cheap breakfast options tooked in a corner behind the concierge that I didn't notice until after we checked out. But there is a McDonald's across the street, some great bagel shops nearby, a Dunkin' donuts around the corner and the;4
We booked last minute and were told the only rooms available were ones with double beds.  However, when we arrived, the woman behind the counter delighted us by saying we were getting a free upgrade to a suite!  The room was huge!  In addition to the bedroom, it had a separate room with a large closet, couch, television, and a Keurig setup.  It was very comfortable and spacious to hang out in.  The staff also provided us with an extra set of blankets, which I had requested for comfort.  We were very pleased with the room and service!  My only gripe is that the pillows were very thick, which caused me a great deal of neck pain (but that's because I have neck issues).  That aside, I would stay here again (while bringing a pillow from home!)!;4
It's in very good location convenient for business and personnel things at comparatively reasonable price. Also all staff offered excellent service with kind hospitality, which will let me stay there for next trip.;4
Hotel is well located for Central Park and next to the Lincoln Centre. The hotel and rooms are old fashioned elegance, comfortable and clean. Fresh towels and bedding provided daily. Coffee machine in the room. There is a stocked fridge and refreshments available to purchase but these are quite expensive.  Most of the queen rooms are at the back and very noisy due to the air conditioning units, we upgraded to a front room which was quiet and with a view over the square and pavement cafe. I would recommend the better rooms unreservedly. Hotel team were all very helpful and pleasant. A short walk from Central Park and Columbus Circle, the open top circular red bus stops opposite the hotel. We walked to and from Times Square a good walk but lots to look at. There are 2 good eating;4
Excellent location for visiting Fordham and Broadway (TKTS office around the corner)and Upper West side. This is my second excellent stay. Be warned that bathroom is extremely small but is adequate.( nice shower). Here for visit with my college student at Fordham.Will stay here again.;4
"I wanted to stay in New York two days. My options were to stay overnight in New York or  ride the LIRR two days in a row, back and forth from family in Long Island. Cost was a factor, location was a factor, and cleanliness was a concern. For a amazing amount of $130, including taxes, we stayed in a VERY CLEAN ""studio"" apartment.  It was the size of an average hotel room, but was well equiped; a sofa bed, a bistro tabel and chairs, a small fridge, toaster, coffee maker, 2 burner stove, and real mugs, glasses, silverware.  The theme was contemporary, with clean lines. The bed appeared new; firm without lumps. The bathroom was all sleek marble tiles, the towels were thick large and soft.  We had a streetside room, and the building across the street was built in 1904 with awesome";4
Our third stay at this hotel because the location and price suits us. We enjoy quick access to bus stops and metro. A few restaurants and shops within easy walking distance.  Neighbourhood a little seedy but we felt reasonably safe at night time walking around and had no hassles or concerns. Very good breakfast , egg chef efficient and friendly. Staff helpful, we checked in early and were not asked to pay extra. Free wifi. Room was clean. Microwave and fridge useful.;4
A very nice hotel, the staff were great and very friendly. Only 8 or so blocks away from Times Square. The room was one of the recently renovated rooms located on the 30th floor. We choose the AAA continental breakfast package with a view of the Hudson.    The continental breakfast was great during the week up in the 39th floor. Very good with a variety of juices and pastries.  But, on Saturday, in the Tick Tock diner, the food was good, but service was questionable. We were seated at a dirty table. The staff waited on all the regular tables before us. In fact the table of 4 that was seated after us, received their entire order before we received coffee.   We did not get the view we requested. And the hotel does not guarantee a specific view, but they state they will try to give;4
Perfect location close to the empire state building,time square,macys,and numerous restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is a little bit tired but my room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff were very polite and helpfull. The restaurant food was excellent along with the breakfast bar.;4
For those visiting Universal Studios, the location can not be beat!  We spent 2 days in LA and were grateful to be within a 5-10 minute walk to the park and Universal City Walk (they also offer a free shuttle service if you'd prefer to be dropped of at the gate).  Staff was friendly, rooms were fine (clean, comfy).  The only negative comments I have would be about the mediocre shower and the very expensive breakfast (not included in our booking).;4
Pros:  Good position near Times Sq and Central Park, two subways and coffee shops for breakfast.  Friendly staff. Quick and efficient check in and out.  Comfortable but small beds  Good double glazing and black out blinds.  Great shower and modern bathroom  Cons:  The brown hessian walls   The mustard yellow and black swirly carpet ... who on earth chose that!  Would definitely stay again;4
We spent 11 nights at New Yorker hotel. We lived in renovated room, in 31st floor. Room was clean, with very confortable mattress, with good AC, clean bathroom including new sink, WC and shower. Every day room was cleaned and towels was changed as often as we wanted. Room has all needed perks as coffee machine (got additional coffee tablets every day), safe, TV with more than needed channels, mini fridge, bathroom amenities as shampoo, shoer gel, conditioner, soap, hair dryer, bath robe.  Yes, the room was tiny, but we fit. :) as our goal was to spent time in New York City not in the hotel room it was more than enough. The location is perfect, basically everywhere can go by foot.  Sadly hotel do not have breakfast and not providing any discounts for guests for Tick Tock Diner;4
Liked the interior, liked our suites, loved the staff. Maggie at the reception desk made us feel welcome. The concierge (I forget his name) was very helpful and entertaining. Took our three teenagers (17, 18, 20 yrs), they too loved it. Right at the corner of Broadway. 10 minutes walk from Broadway show Sister Act (hilarious show), opposite Lincoln center. Absolutely a 'must do it again'.;4
"The place have been recently renewed, including the rooms. By the way, the room is really small. The bath doesn't have door or curtain, wich is weird, but the repcionist told me that was the ""european design"". I din't know European people liked to wash the bathroom everytime they take a shower. The hi-speed internet access is only complementary on the lobby, as in the rooms they charge $13 for 24 hours. And the speed isn't that high... the location is great, although if you want to stay closer to Times Square, there are better options.";4
all good except flies on food and food area need to be controlled by placing a screen curtain around food area. we found dead fly on the cake. for second time we have stayed there when we travelled to los angles.  wifi sucks.;4
We chose this Hilton due to location near the Universal Studios.  Big hotel with very nice views from room over backside from BelAir hills (Mulholland Drive). Unfortunately - and this is only Minus - runs a 4 hines highway aside the hotel and as the windows are thin one hears the traffic noice thoughout the night.  It is therefore recommended to ask for rooms to another side.  Room was large but - as many Hilton hotels, a bit outdated. Bathroom Showers also had not 4* standard.   Pool looks nice although we didn't use it.  People will chose this hotel  mainly for shortness to Universal Studios and therefore it's perfect.;4
So I was trying to have a new experience. Stay in the Upper-West. And it was very good indeed! Totally different from being in Soho (I stayed in Winter), or in Mid-town East (Spring), I was on vacation. And wanted the feeling of being on a vacation, and not in the busy Manhattan. So they have a local shops, Wholefoods, and 2 metro stations (red line and blue line). And a short walk to the Central Park. What else do you need when on vacation... Now, be very honest. It is NOT for someone who wants to shop, or tour the city. It has not many tourist places around. It is more to relax and go to specific places.;4
Room looks good. Has all the standard items except for an in room microwave.   Parking garage has decent sized spaces (not cramped).  Walking distance to Universal Studios. The restaurant in the building is a buffet style.  Nothing special about the stay though.;4
Great location, fabulous room, excellent service.  A stone's throw from Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle (subway, Jazz, shopping and a Whole Foods).  Our room was generous considering this is an old NYC hotel.  The staff was knowledgeable and helpful.  OK, the wall paper in the hallway is not to every one's taste and the elevators are not the fastest, but this hotel is great value.  If you are single, note, guests are mostly European which makes for great conversations at the bar.;4
You are working on getting rooms in better shape.  This trip was a great improvement from other visits.  I am a frequent guest at the Empire Hotel.  The location is great for going to the Metropolitan Opera. The restaurant has good choices and high quality.;4
We stayed at The New Yorker for 5 nights from 18th November. Slight mix up by our travel agent was sorted by the brilliant Cornelia at reception who also gave us some good tips for NY and was generally very friendly and helpful.  Our room was on 34th floor and, whilst nothing spectacular, it was perfectly functional given we didn't plan on spending much time in the room. Bed was really comfortable, lots of hangers in the wardrobe and our cleaner also did a great job. The view from our room was amazing and I would recommend going for a high room.  The hotel really is in the perfect location right by Penn Station. Perfect for travel by air train and LIRR from JFK and for getting around whilst in NY. Would really advise getting the weekly MTA travel card for $30ish which allows;4
I booked this hotel thinking it was closer to Hollywood Blvd, but it was on the east side. We were dropping our son off at college so it was not a problem as we used Uber to move around.  Our room was clean, the breakfast buffet was great but that was the only food service available.  If you order in, it is from a local restaurant and takes a while to deliver.  The outdoor pool was small but nice and no alcohol was allowed. Generally the overall appearance of the hallways or front desk area were immaculate and the staff very helpful.  Some renovations were going on in the hallways but never interfered. The cost was very reasonable and I would book here again.;4
I enjoyed everything about the hotel apart from the heat in the room. I had to have the window open constantly and the fan on full power constantly. For the single cabin room, there is just too much heat in the room.  Other than that, the staff were excellent and they more than met my expectations. I enjoyed my stay at The Jane and if I am ever back in New York, this is the place I will stay. Ideal location, very quiet, relaxed atmosphere, and the price is reasonable for the city.;4
Really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton.  Very clean and the staff is really friendly.  We were walking distance to Universal Studios but the Hotel did supply a shuttle if needed.  We had the buffet breakfast which was pretty good.  Would definitely stay at this Hilton again.;4
This hotel is situated on 8th Avenue, corner of 34th Street. It is in a very central position for all attractions. The Empire State Building and Macys are a short stroll away. Check in was very straight forward with a luggage check in if you arrive early and your room is unavailable. We asked for a high floor overlooking the Empire State Building and the views are fantastic. The room was small as you can expect in New York, the bed was comfortable and the room well kept.  Within the service charge you have free Wi Fi, telephone calls and use of the gym. Tick Toch diner attached to the hotel serves a very good breakfast. Visit the lower ground floor which illustrates the history of the hotel and famous guests that have stayed there.;4
stay in this property for 4 nights. it is an old hotel so room is very small good enough for overnight sleep. if you think you need to spend lots time in the room then I will not recommend this hotel.  location is great next to Penn Station subway. Many restaurants within walking distance. one 24/7 restaurant is in the hotel property convenience for breakfast . McDonald and Starbucks just across the street.   Time square is 15 minutes walk. By the way, my room have a prefect view of Empire State Building .;4
Great location. Just across the Columbus Avenue from Lincoln Center, Metropolitan Opera. Near two metro stations: Lincoln Center (red line 1) and Columbus Circle (blue line A,C and orange B,D) - easily accessible from JFK Airport. Central Park is one block from the hotel. Zoo or the Museum of Natural History are in 15-minute leisurely pace. Very convenient location for the participants of New York City Maraphon - just five minutes from the finish to the hotel. Great staff. Excellent housekeeping. Good coffee machine. Good WiFi.  But noisy. You can hear what's going on in the next room. You can only pray for quiet neighbors, but sometimes it does not help. My room was on the 4th floor with a window on the Broadway, and at night the noise of passing cars hindered sleep.;4
Arrived on Monday the eve of snowmageddon and watched the city close down from the windows (3) of our spacious corner suite room. Spectacular! Sadly the opera we had come to see was canceled. Instead we walked in the snow, found provisions in the many small bodegas on Broadway, and even found a fantastic sushi bar on 72nd street that was still open. The Empire is perfectly situated one block from the subway, surrounded by restaurants, stores, and a block away Central Park. Tuesday things returned to normal and that night we walked across the plaza to the greatest opera house in the world. Will definitely be back again. Fantastic door men!;4
We went after a movie for late snack. The mushroom soup had lots of mushrooms and onions and cheese on top.  The Caesar salad was gear with Parmesan chips.  Service was great.  Will like to go back for full meal.  Seeing some meals go by looked wonderful.  It is close to the Angelika movie theater, like 2 blocks.  Rosemary fries were also nice and very large portion;4
Can walk to and from the park entrance.  There is also a shuttle every 15 minutes to the City walk entrance.  Rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable.  They are replacing carpet in the lobby currently.  Pool and hot tub nice with towels available there.  Hotel is huge.  Breakfast expensive ($36 for eggs and bacon).  Parking is $28 per day with in and out flexibility.  Valet parking available.;4
There for Ed's Chowder house which was a reasonably good experience. This is a very busy traffic and people area. This building  is old as dirt. Oh, sorry, it is part of New York history and worth experiencing. I can imagine unlike the new hotels that are sandwiched together the views from the rooms are great. The lobby is a dark red wine color dacor there is a balcony area that has comfortable velvet sofa seating that is wifi connected. There are a lot of available cabs but make sure they understand where you want to go as they don't speak english. Directly across the street from Lincoln Center so I can imagine that they get interesting guests. Within walking distance of city attactions, shopping and resturants. The staff can have an attitude but not all of them.;4
A nice hotel, expensive but they all are in NYC. Small room, noisy air con and be aware that a USA Queen bed is only 60 inches as opposed to the bigger size in the UK. Pool closed for the winter. Otherwise clean and comfortable, cotton sheets, comfy bed, nice rooftop bar and a good location with plenty of places to eat at nearby.;4
This is the third time I have stayed at The Jane, everything was great but the mattress was not very comfortable. You could really feel the springs in the mattress. I stayed in room 426. Other than that I would stay here again.;4
I don't know why I did not know about this great spot before. The access to just about everything you could want was terrific. .. We were upgraded without asking, and were given great rooms and suite. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The internet access was not great, but this would not prevent us from returning. Soon!;4
I just got back from a long weekend/girls trip to NYC, and we had a great experience at the Empire Hotel! We loved the location near the Lincoln Center and Central Park, the restaurants nearby were wonderful, and the hotel was right next to the subway lines we needed for all of the sightseeing we were doing. We found the hotel to be clean and attractive. We loved the decor in the lobby, bar, and mezzanine levels -- it was a lot of fun to relax with a drink in the bar and enjoy the surroundings. The room was also nicely decorated, and a decent size for a NYC hotel room. The pool area and rooftop bar were beautiful! Most of the hotel staff went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant, from the doormen and the front desk, to the bartenders and maintenance staff.  The room did;4
Really enjoyed our stay here (family of 4 in a queen suite). Very comfortable,room was spotless with fresh towels everyday. The location is the best part about this as its central to most things and theres a subway stop right outside your door.   Special mention to the staff who were so easy to deal and very accommodating.;4
Very convenient to Lincoln Centre, museums, and Central Park. Excellent restaurant with very good service. Serious attention needed to elevators! Several out of service, and we were plagued by malfunctions, including being stuck in one for a while as it went up and down, stopping at floors w/o doors opening etc!!;4
We had a family of 4 so room was a little tight. They also were double beds so small for a couple and teenage kids. The lobby was under construction which was a bit inconvenient. Luckily they had a great rooftop to hang out on. Some coffee in lobby in morning would be nice.;4
We drove in after 3 hour drive, we enjoyed cocktails by the pool.  Walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk.  Also, Hollywood and Griffith Observatory.  Service here excellent.;4
Spacious room with balcony. Great amenities in the bathroom - even provided a mini hand sanitiser which I thought was fantastic. Always parking available in the large car park. Gym on site. Cafes nearby for coffee. Laundromat directly opposite the hotel. Nancy at the hotel is fantastic! Great customer service. Assisted with my reservation in a friendly manner, prompt responses and nothing was ever difficult. She's very switched on!! Such a great asset to the hotel. I would stay again purely due to Nancy's service and the spacious rooms.;4
The location opposite the Lincoln Center is amazing and so easy to get around NYC from. The hotel invoked great Gossip Girl memories for my daughter and she loved the Chuck Bass cocktail in the hotel bar where many Gossip Girl scenes were shot. Rooms were very small and walls very thin. Could hear coughing next door all night. Door did not automatically shut and several times we found it open. Decoration is tired and is in need of a complete refurbishment. Disappointed roof bar was not open and only half of the neon sign was lit. The staff were really nice and helpful and the doormen were amazing and very welcoming. Bar hours were odd and same with Edâs Chowder House. Hotel charges for In-room self brewed tea & coffee - inappropriate.;4
Excellent property, location and complimentary shuttle to and from the airport. The staff are friendly, the facilities offer ample food and beverage, and the rooms are comfortable. You can get great value at this property. I found my room to be quiet.;4
Really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were small but clean. But bedding nice and good pillows made up for that. Bathroom small but good enough for the time you spend in there. Downside there is no consiege which I thought was strange for such a big hotel. Reception staff quite helpful though.  Would definitely stay here again because of the location. Penn station just over the road. Not far from Time Square, Empire State and Macy's.  All in all a good stay.;4
This hotel is so close to Universal Studios that we walked back to the hotel for an afternoon swim.  They left us a welcome basket with grapes, oranges, bananas, oreos, and bottled water.  The hotel staff called us on our first night to welcome us and make sure we had everything we needed.  The beds were super comfortable.  The bathroom was quite large.  The pool was great but not good for little ones.  It gets deep very fast, our youngest happily hung out on the very long steps.  We were on the 18th floor but never had to wait more than two minutes for an elevator.  We only stayed here because of the proximity to Universal.  We would definately stay here again.;4
"Me and my sister stayed at Abercorn House for a few days. We were really surprised at how nice it was considering how ""cheap"" it was. Our room was simple and small but we had really comfortable beds and everything was clean. The shower wasn't the best but it didn't matter. The location is really really good. You can get zone 2 tube tickets and easily get into London city in about 15 minutes. It's so easy and Hammersmith itself is beautiful too. There are plenty options to buy food and drinks.  the only reason to rate only four stars is because we had some difficulties paying and the walls are very thin so it feels like strangers are literally next to you.  Anyway we loved our stay there and would recommend it to anyone searching for a simple stay close to London City.";4
"My room was surprisingly spacious for a NY hotel; the bed was comfy and so were the pillows - a big plus.  Noise level was acceptable, and the staff were quite friendly.  The location can't be beat; I would stay here again.";4
I was traveling alone this trip to NYC and wanted to find something affordable, clean and safe. While there are some options in the affordable category there the clean and/or safe were sometimes questionable. I discovered the Jane on some website and upon reading all the glowing reviews and checking out the site it seemed perfect... and it was.   The hotel is in a lovely neighborhood, treelined and quiet, just across from the Hudson. The subway was a good 5-8 min walk - not too shabby, although some days after walking all day in the sweltering heat I wished it had been a couple blocks closer.   The building is stunning. Beautifully restored with a number of period details. There is a little french cafe on the main floor. The room was tiny. Do not be alarmed though... it is;4
This hotel is a bit dated but it was very clean. The rooms are small. I was alone in my room but think it would have been a bit tight if I was with someone. There is not much room for your suitcase. I kept putting mine on the bed and would zip it up and store it on the floor. The air conditioner could have been colder but that is because I like a cold room to sleep in (approx 65F/18C).  The shower was great. Lots of pressure and hot water. The location was pretty good. It was close to Macy's but a bit of a walk to Times Square and Broadway. Also, a hike to Central Park and the Rockefeller Center. I am older and I was able to walk to all these places. Empire State Building was a bit closer to walk to. It is right by Penn Station (almost next door) and Madison Square Gardens.;4
every one was helpful, smiling, and friendly.  The only drawback was the size of the rooms which are small and the bed was small.;4
The hotel is quaint centrally located by Lincoln Center a great area.  Roof top bar has great view and is a nice place to gather.  Rooms are small but well appointed and the room rate is competitive.  Right downstairs you have PJ Clarks a great restaurant for a casual meal.;4
"I was so excited to give this hotel a try as I am over paying a small fortune for a few nights stay in the city. I've never stayed in a hostel and I'm used to business and resort class hotels. That said, all I need when I come to NYC is a clean, safe, comfortable, quiet place to stay and that is exactly what I got. First of all, most of the people that stay here are friendly and understand the concept of shared bathroom/shower facilities and living in close quarters. In fact, I found it kinda cool stepping out of the enclosed shower in my robe to find total strangers brushing their teeth and saying ""good morning"". The cafe on the first floor was also a highlight in the morning serving yummy almond croissants. I stayed in a cabin room; which is small--but again all I really";4
I just stayed at the Ameritania for 2 nights. My husband and I had stayed there once before and liked it, so I looked forward to staying here again. One of the best things about this hotel is its location. While the hotel is described as being in Times Square, it is a few blocks away from the craziness of Times Square. Columbus Circle is nearby, which is great for transportation, and many restaurants and theaters are also close by. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. I think it was a pretty good size for a NY hotel. My only complaint is the amount of street noise I could hear throughout the night. I was given a room on the 3rd floor facing 54th street, so that probably added extra noise into my room. I found ear plugs in the bathroom, and now I know why! I would recommend;4
I found this hotel on a site from work so I had a great discount. I had a class the night was to drive up so I called ahead. The receptionist was very polite and assured me I'd be fine coming in late. When I arrived I was greeted by Nancy (I hope that was her name) and she quickly checked me in.  The room was very pretty. It might be time to start touch pips but it was well lit and decorated. The balcony overlooked the courtyard and held a lovely view. The next morning my friend and I went to their free breakfast. It was great! Even if you don't want to eat, go for the free coffee and to watch Chef Hugo work the omelet line. It was at least 10 deep and as soon as he finished one omelet another person would Jon the line. He's cheerful and polite while working his butt off. I'd;4
Pleasantly surprised by this budget hotel. Room was clean and quiet but crowded with both beds. Bathroom decent size and well stocked. TV reception poor and no cable. Elevator has some scary noises. Staff was friendly. Stayed 4 nights for daughter's graduation.;4
The hotel shuttle passed us by at the airport. We were offered ride from another shuttle operator when he say them zoom by a waving passenger. The receptionist didn't seem concerned. Not a big deal but this is supposed to be a first class hotel.;4
Hotel was fine and the staff was very helpful - I would not go to NY unless you have to. People are peeing and taking craps right on the side walk. People have snack tables set up all over the sidewalks to sell drugs. So many homeless and people with metal health issues all around the hotel. City is not safe;4
We stayed at this hotel in May 2012 - obtained through an Expedia Secret Saver deal (so didn't know which hotel we would be getting at the time). At first it was a disaster as on checking in we had to wait ages while our room on the so called 10th floor was ready....we checked back and were told we were now on the 8th Floor.  Went to the room and it was right near the lift (noisy) and had 2 beds instead of one queen etc.  We went down and complained and was given a lovely room on the 2nd floor that was much larger and just perfect for us. (Only complaint was the mini fridge ...although working was keeping drinks at room temperature). Did check out the night club but was not really our scene - didn't hear any noise in our room. Hotel was nice and close to everything.   Did have;4
Location is the USP of this hotel, almost everything in Mid Manhattan is walking from this hotel. Central Park, Times Square, Empire State, etc. Very happening neighborhood, gives a real feel of New York streets.;4
you really need to put some more thought into the staff that is in the dining area during breakfast hours. having someone that can actually communicate with people would be important to me if I was the hotel manager. That person should also understand what common courtesy and good manners mean in a customer service environment. bumping into people and reaching across tables while customers are eating has always been rude behavior where I come from.;4
The location of the hotel is great, just opposite to the Penn Station. Walking distance to Macy for shopping, Empire State Building for a great view of the Big Apple if you like. And around 10 minutes walk to Time Square. If you want to take subway, definitely convenient as it is in Midtown Manhattan. You can have a lot of choices for food, no doubt. No matter fast food, e.g. McDonald's, or a coffee at Starbucks, or some restaurant to sit down and enjoy. The hotel also has a restaurant offering breakfast, but we didn't try. Back to the hotel itself, the lobby is very beautiful and the room is big compared with other hotels we live in Manhattan. A little bit old fashioned room but very clean. Staffs are friendly, no matter the counter staff or the room service staff. And the;4
If you want a hotel in the Village, next to the Hudson River and the Hudson River Trail as well as the Hi Line (which is wonderful) then this is the place for you.  If you are looking for 5 star luxury, then it's not.  The hotel is clean, the staff is very pleasant and helpful, but the rooms are small and you may run out of hot water.  The hotel had it's 100 year anniversary, I believe, and you'll know that it has been lovingly maintained, but it is still old.  We had a lovely 3 night stay, but I prefer Midtown.;4
"Across from Lincoln Center,  two blocks from Central Park, a few blocks from Columbus Circle and subway lines. The hotel is clean and our room, a corner suite, was spacious-- can't vouch for the rest. Busy restaurant on rooftop. Pool is just a ""bathtub with style.""  We are always treated with courtesy and helpfulness. Maid service is top notch.";4
This was a nice hotel if you want to walk through the Park every day. It is close to Columbus circle and to metro stations. It has a nice restaurant and is adjacent to a Starbucks. However, the rooms have poor noise insulation and you can hear other residents, the street, everything. Room was a bit small as well. There is WiFi in the lobby area.;4
Out of all of Manhattan, I think this place offers the best value. The rooms are tiny and beds not made for those over 6 feet tall but if you're just looking for a place to rest your head at night, this is a great option. Shared bathrooms are clean and I never had to wait to use the showers. Loved the character of the old hotel with updated, modern fixtures. Couldn't hope for a better neighbourhood with the highline and Chelsea Market a block north, surrounded by great restaurants and clubs.;4
i found this place on hotels.com. with its great location (just west of central park, at the north west corner), and private bath, its price is unbeatable. it is located only a block away from subway station (take B or C line to downtown, note that B only runs on weekdays) and M10 bus right in front of the door.  we went there in April with some chilly nights, they even turned on radiator on, which was good. the only downside is that radiator is a little loud at night with all the water going through pipes. i noticed that there is A/C in the room, so in summer time, it might be a problem.  The staff at front desk is extremely friendly and helpful.  the room is a bit small, but for two ppl in one room, it worked out fine. i will definitely stay there again.;4
Great location, so close to Times Square and easy to work to many other sites and places to visit. The staff are lovely, very helpful and happy to advise if required. We received a free up grade and bottle of wine in our room as we were visiting to celebrate a special occasion. Thank Ameritania for this. The room was spacious and clean. The air con/heating was noisy but we rarely needed it so this didn't bother us.  The only downsides were no WIFI in the room which surprised us. You could have it but had to pay extra and the amount was $25 for 2 days? I would have thought in this age it would be available. We like to relax in our room and plan our next day, hunt out places to eat etc which meant we couldn't do this. Also no tea and coffee facilities in the room, yes you could;4
This hotel is a great deal. The property is very unique. The rooms are very small, but designed like an old ships cabin. The restrooms are down the hall. The restaurant is very good. The lounge is classic. The staff is wonderful.;4
I would never stay here again because the beds were way too soft for my back.  Also, the food prices (especially room service) at the hotel made us think we were in New York or London....crazy expensive.  However, the staff was very nice and it is located right by Universal Studios Hollywood. The shuttle to the theme park was very convenient.;4
"I booked a standard cabin, and it was roomy enough. I was not going to be spending a ot of time in the hotel as I was going to several sites in Lower Manhattan including the High Line, the African Burial Ground, and the Museum of the Chinese in the Americas. The Jane is conveniently located near all of them Sleeping was comfortable. There could have been slightly better work space. Fortunately, I did not have to do much more than check and write some e-mails.  I was impressed by the staff-I heard staff peaking several different language with guests including Spanish and German. They were all quite polite and friendly. Using the communal bathroom was a bit of a bother; I am older and have to get up several times a night. Next time I stay here I will use a Captain's Cabin with a";4
Jose was great.  I told him we were staying at the hotel for our anniversary and asked if there were any rooms with a view.  At first, he checked quickly and couldn't find anything.  However, he took the time to look further and called us in our room to say that he was actually able to find a view after all.;4
The hotel is close to the Lincoln Center and Central Park and within walking distance of Times Square, Broadway shows and the Avenue of the Americas.  The hotel was clean and the staff helpful, especially the concierge.  Wifi was available in the lobby and mezzanine but the light in the mezzanine made it very difficult to read.  Great view from the window of the room of the Lincoln Center and all the cabs coming down the street.;4
We came up from San Diego to go to the Hollywood Bowl, so this location was perfect. The room was large and clean. Although we normally like to stay in boutique or more modern hotels, this worked great due to it's location, parking, and the service was good.;4
The view from the rooms is amazing.The front desk was very helpful especially Pamela who remembered my name and made sure that my stay was comfortable. The location is great especially if you'll be visiting universal studios which is a walking distance away.;4
"We love staying at the Empire because 1) it's location (directly across the street from the Lincoln Center; 2) lots of surrounding restaurants and delis (and coffee); 3) The room was very clean and bed (which is extremely important - was clean and and does not feel like a 1000 people have slept there).  The bathroom was a bit dated, but clean and functional (that was the only reason I did not give the facility 5 stars).  The hotel does have a fabulous roof top view / bar / pool!  Rare find in NYC.  So, in summary, we have stayed at this hotel twice, and have enjoyed both visits, and would book again.";4
"Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, which sort of has a ""grand"" feel to it, but with a laid back attitude.  Some small improvements would make it an excellent hotel - parking is expensive (but this is LA after all), lifts didn't function too well, the aircon in the room was super noisy, the bar was pretty sterile and for HHonors Gold members the breakfast voucher is only for continental breakfast.  However, the room I had was lovely and spacious with a great view and I really enjoyed returning to this hotel each evening.";4
Got to stay by the airport . I had an early flight and wanted a place with easy access and a shuttle service.  The rooms are spacious , clean and the staff friendly .    The bar area has a restaurant, they have Starbucks. I highly recommend it , for anyone that needs a convenient  short stay;4
Upsides: Very good location for access to Times Square and Central Park. Downsides: really tiny room and WiFi only in the lobby. Room was ready early and as requested it was on an upper floor so was quiet.  Great service.;4
Perfect location! We were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful. Old hotel but very clean and has its own character and style. As a bathroom snob, I was impressed with the cleaniless and how white the towels and shower curtain was. Tasteful decor throughout and great veiws of the city at night AND Nikola Tesla lived here! Would definitely stay here again.;4
The staff at the reception and room service were friendly, patient and very helpful. The locationn was excellent with many restaurants nearby.Churches, Metropolitan Opera, Lincol Center all within walking distance.;4
Lovely clean rooms. Very helpful staff. Modern design which isnât to my taste, but when youâre out and about all day, it doesnât matter! Bed is like sleeping on a cloud! Bar man was very friendly. Would use again.;4
The Jane is an experience by itself: like taking the Orient Express train. You will be welcomed and ushered by a groom with full costume. The rooms are tiny, but you know what to expect. It is very clean (and that includes bathroom and restrooms), quiet and there is heaps of storage in this room. It's really like staying in a train. The decor is nice and the staff very friendly: you can see they are happy to work there (the receptionist was doing a happy dance until she realises I was watching her...). The Restaurant is nice, but noisy. Try the couscous. Safe area and about 7 min walk to the metro. Highly recommended for a solo traveller who wants a short stay without spending all your money.;4
The best thing about the hotel is it's location! Thereafter, it's all about good value for a NYC property.   The standard rooms are absolutely tiny but just ok for sleeping and washing. Beds are smallish but fantastically comfortable. Door staff are super-helpful and the Reception team are good too.  Overall, the decor of this place is modern and, if room size won't ruin your city break then you can't go wrong with The  ameritania.  Would be go back? Not really sure. I would probably try and find somewhere with bigger rooms in the same area for a similar price however, if that fails then I would be happy to revisit.;4
I needed absolutely for a free wi-fi net in all the rooms. If you travel for business it is the least you are waiting for the money you pay! The room was very comfortable, may be a bit old, but anyway very good.;4
Scored Billy Joel concert tickets in December for his show on my birthday.  Booked The New Yorker on booking.com for a great rate.  Got off the train at Penn Station, and the hotel is a half a block walk.  Short wait to check in.  Typical NY hotel room -- a little small, but adequate.  2 restaurants onsite which is convenient.  MSG right next to Penn Station, so just a half block walk to the concert.  Didn't  appreciate the timeshare sales pitch right after check in.  Will stay here again for the convenience to the train station and MSG.;4
This hotel is in a great location and the rooftop bar is lovely when the weather allows . We were lucky to have really nice weather for March . The room was spacious and clean however the bathroom was very small. Staff are very friendly and helpful.We had a superiour kingsize room that requiired a little updating but was as already stated a good size for a NY hotel.;4
Great to see a concert at MSG. Lots of places to eat and shopping nearby. No fridge in room only downside. Very strict security code hat monitors the door. Three restaurants on site that were very good;4
Our stay at the empire because we didn't know the city and it was where friends were staying that were attending the same events. Now i know we were just sleeping in the room, but for the price, it bit more space would have been nice. Also, how about a free coffee or something. You are charged if you use the in room coffee maker. It's cheaper to go next door to Starbucks.  The staff is excellent and freindly. Some furnishings need a bit of an update.;4
I enjoyed my stay and the views of NYC. Staff was friendly. The diner connected to the hotel was very good.;4
My friend and i were on a fairly tight budget. We had both been to New York before but had never stayed in region in Central park West. We both found the hotel to be basic but clean and safe. Staff were friendly. Checked transfers for us free of charge. No charge for fridge. Clean linen.Drinks and snacks availaable.Opposite park and next to Turkish Deli which served cheap food all day. Round corner from Harlem. Completely safe and friendly. Nice to take drinks and food into park for breakfast and watch the world go by.Air con could have been cooler.;4
"Had dinner in their nice Italian Bistro on the ground floor. The ""Old Rose"".  Food and atmosphere were great.They are new and asked for feedback. We were happy to give it. But our criticism was minor- mostly regarding spicing in cetrain dishes. The chef obviously cares about what he is putting out of the kitchen.  But our criticism was minor- mostly regarding spicing in cetrain dishes. The chef obviously cares about what he is putting out of the kitchen.   The wait staff is efficient and friendly. They have some new recruits and they were trying their best and I expect they will get to the efficiency level of their more experienced brethren.   Had a night cap at the roof tar bar overlooking the East River. A lovely place. It took a while to get the bartenders attention at an";4
Considering as hostel, the room and shared bathroom it were cleaned all mornings. The staff was very polite and available 24 hours. There are one market and subway station close to hostel. There no hair dryer in the room, but just ask the staff and get just to use.;4
This hotel was super close to the airport with a shuttle to conveniently take you to and from LAX. The inside lobby as well as the rooms are very modern,  chic, and minimalist, but with all the necessary amenities. The best part however was the customer service. Check-in was super quick and easy and every staff person I encountered said hello and was super helpful. If I ever need to stay near the airport again, I would definitely choose the Hyatt Regency.;4
Older hotel but in a great location! Across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Close to and within walking distance to Macy's, Empire State Building, Herald Square, Flat Iron Building and Times Square. Room was nice....pretty standard...2 double beds, small bathroom, closet. Good views in some rooms...others not so much. Security was great and felt that the hotel did a great job of making sure people that were in the hotel were actually guests of the hotel. Two restaurants attached to the hotel...ate at Tick Tock for Breakfast my last day...diner atmosphere, pretty good food. There's also a McDonald's and Starbucks across the street. The only reason I am not not giving an excellent rating is I reserved 2 rooms...checked in at 3pm (which is check-in time) and;4
Great location near Central Park and right next to subway station. Lots of restaurants within few minutes walk - good to escape back to after a busy day sight-seeing.  Friendly helpful staff - prices for room service - mini bar steep but starbuck's and convenience store/ pharmacy next door so easy to stock up. Would definitely recommend it;4
My friend and I was in LA from 18th January to 1st February and stayed that time in Hollywood Hotel. Service was great, room was clean and breakfast is awesome. Especially personnel which make breakfast omelettes and scrambled eggs are extremely skillful and friendly. Near by is also Griffith park which is really nice to walk and see the scenery.;4
This hotel is in the perfect location for a stay in NYC. It's only a few blocks away from a lot of tourist areas you would want to see when visiting New York.   The rooms are quite small, but a decent size. Unfortunately, the one I was in didn't offer a fridge, microwave or anything of that sort. I am not sure if maybe the higher grade suites do offer this. As I didn't want to eat out for every meal these things would've been nice.   All the staff I encountered were extremely helpful and friendly. However, for 3 of the 4 mornings I was there I had housekeeping knocking on my door even though I can the Do Not Disturb sign on! I did not appreciate being woken up to knocking to tell them I didn't need anything when the Do Not Disturb sign is supposed to do that!   Otherwise, an;4
The hotel is perfectly located one block from Central Park, Lincoln Center and three blocks from Columbus Circle. It's walking distance to Time Square-area and all the Broadway shows.  We hade a Superior room and got the view north with Broadway and Columbus streets. The room and bathroom was not very big but well equipped, nice and clean. AC was ok, but a bit noisy. Try to get a room high up in the building as the traffic is close. We had breakfast most mornings at Ed's restaurant located in the hotel building. The had a nice breakfast at good prices. We would choose the Empire again when visiting NYC.;4
We were mostly happy with our stay here. The staff were welcoming, the parking was very secure, our room itself was beautiful and spotless with a lovely terrace looking into the central seating area. Our only issue was with the bathroom. In comparison to the room it was very dated and the temperature in the shower changed constantly. We also noticed loads of ants in the bathroom, we told reception who informed us that they are sugar ants from the palm trees and that they would send a cleaner in that day to get rid of them, which is fine. Unfortunately when we returned 12 hours later a cleaner had definitely not been as the towels that we left on the floor had not moved and there were still ants absolutely everywhere. We didnât bother saying anything as we were leaving the next;4
It was quite a while ago now but thought I may as well give a review.  It is a very large hotel with so many rooms I don't think reception knew much about them but they persevered with our request until we found one with a view of the Hudson River so we were happy in the end. I was thrilled to stay there as it is quite iconic.;4
Really nice rooms - I was only floor 30 which have recently been renovated and although not huge, it was perfect. The location is excellent for so many great tourist attractions - Empire State, Times Sq, shopping etc Really great staff - so friendly and helpful Highly recommended;4
"I travel to NY reasonably regularly and pick hotels based on a combination of three factors:  location within the city, TripAdvisor ranking, and cost.  On this trip, I selected Ameritania because it was very close to my business meeting, got good ratings, and offered a competitive price.  Overall I had a good first experience.  I got there a bit early and was able to check in before the normal time.  The location was convenient not only for my meeting but for much of what anyone visiting NY would want to do (restaurants, theater, other social/cultural activities, transportation, etc.).  The room was small - no desk/chair setup; there was space only for the bed and the closet - but small rooms are not unusual in NY, and I knew I wouldn't be spending much time in my room, so it";4
This hotel is in the perfect location if you want to visit Universal. It's walking distance to the park entrance (about as far as you would walk from the parking lots), but there is also a shuttle. I actually stayed here on a business trip and didn't visit Universal. The walk down to the metro station is about 10 minutes downhill (a huge hill), there's a shuttle to take you back up the hill if you want but it goes to City Walk not the Hilton (another shuttle will take you back to the Hilton or you can walk). The room itself was large and clean. The beds were really comfortable! Bathroom was spacious. The tub definitely had some wear and tear, though. The plumbing for the shower was a pain, it would drip constantly and never turn completely off. Biggest complaint about the hotel;4
They have a revolving door you arenât supposed to touch when you are going through it.  If it stops, you stop it will start again.  That was one example of a hotel that had a lot of personality located near Madison Square Garden.  Itâs an older place, but looks like it has had quite a bit of renovation in recent years.  They upgraded me to what they called an executive room which seemed small and made me wonder what my original room would have looked like.  It was fine.  Didnât spend a lot of time there anyway.  They did need to do some finishing work in the room.  I noticed a few unfinished & rusted spots.  The WiFi worked very well and you are nearby major attractions.  When checking in, I saw a desk separate from the check-in desk.  It had a Wyndham Rewards sign on it.  I;4
Great staff and a clean hotel which is totally fit for purpose for a stay in New York. The rooms are the usual size for a double in your home which is fine. Location excellent for Time Square and the theatres.;4
Just back from a 6 day break after staying here. Modern boutique style hotel with average sized room. Staff friendly especially Jeff doorman who organised car to the airport. Our room was clean and tidy but being New York didn't spend much time in it. Would definitely recommend it as it's location is great near Time Square. Can be a bit noisy but it is New York!!;4
The check in and check out process was easy. The hotel is older but clean. The rooms are typically sized for New York City hotels. Great location next to Madison Square Garden. Affordable and would recommend.;4
Just come back on the 20th July after 5  days, 10 women and what a time we had. Saw everything that we wanted and more.  Hotel was right in the center with Madison Square Gardens across the road, Macy's and Empire State just a 10 minute walk away. Penn Station also across the road which we used a lot to get us to ground zero and Central Park. Times Square just 2 blocks away 15 minute walk no need to get a cab. We had 3 rooms in all, 2 with 3 people in and 1 room with 4 of us. Our room with 4 in was fine, we had 2 double beds, air con (much needed)bathroom was fine and a small built in wardrobe. The room was fine as we did not spend much time in it other then to sleep. The Hotel is in an Art Deco design which I imagine was the fashion when it was built. Dinner, bar and Steak;4
This hotel ticked all the boxes for what we wanted in a hotel for Universal Studios and surrounding studios. The room was comfortable and clean while also being quite large. The check in staff are pleasant and helpful.The little shop they have for snacks and drinks is also convenient.;4
First of all i have to agree with some other reviews regarding the size of the room we stayed in,its the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in but to be honest it did not bother us too much,all we wanted was somewhere to lay our head and it was most prob one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in!! The hotel and rooms were very clean and the location was amazing,literally a 5 min walk to Central Park and a 15 minute walk to Time Square and right opposite the Lincoln Centre,we stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and if we come back to New York we would like to stay here again.  Kate and Matt;4
We stayed here for 3 nights in October 2014. It's a very nice property (which you'd excpect in this part of LA). The room was very spacious and comfortable and had a great view of Universal Studios which was about a 10 minute walk away or you could take the free shuttle bus. The breakfast buffet was very good, it wasn't cheap but will do the job. The staff were excellent and always seemed genuine when providing help.  One evening there was a entertainer playing the piano and singing in the bar which was a nice touch.  Location wise it's not far from Universal Studios and also about 10 minute from the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  It's a long 30 minute + drive (depending on traffic) to Santa Monica Beach so plan your days wisely.  We definitely would stay here again, the room was;4
Love this hotel and the location.  The staff are super friendly and efficient as well!  The rooms are a little tired and the could use a little more lighting but overall great hotel!  The rooms with views are great but rooms in the back overlooking vents are subpar.  You cannot beat location!;4
The Empire Hotel is superbly located and offers large comfortable rooms (I had a King Deluxe). The staff are helpful and friendly and I will certainly consider returning on future visits to New York. My only negative comment I will make is in regards to the hoards of guests, myself included, who loiter in the lobby area to access the free wifi. I felt that this detracted from the ambience and style of the hotel and management should consider offering free in room wifi to discourage this behaviour.;4
I booked this hotel because of 2 reasons:  it was just across the street from where I needed to go:  the Symphony Space Theater and also because it was the least expensive I found.  The location is excellent, just less than a block away from the Subway station, and there are many restaurants around it, many open late after midnight.  Itâs also a couple blocks walking distance from Central Park.  As soon as I got the lobby was awfully hot because the a/c had broke down, which hopefully by now they have fixed.  The lobby does not look very inviting, since it looks outdated, as well as the elevators which are very old and the hallways are narrow and smell funky.  However, even though the a/c in the room is noisy and I did not have a room view, I have to recognize the room was very;4
I would recommend The Jane to anyone who needs a cheap, but trendy place to rest their head in NYC.  It's location can't be beat.  The decor- while a bit shabby- was so boho cool that I couldn't believe how low the prices were.  Cleanliness was excellent.  The staff was very helpful.  I didn't get to experience Cafe Gitane because it was under renovation, but the avocado toast and coffee I got was delicious.  My favorite feature- my sunken tub.  It was heavenly.  The only cons- the club downstairs (seven floors down, mind) was so noisy in the early morning hours that it woke me up and kept me awake.  Also, the bed wasn't terribly comfortable.  Neither would prevent me from staying again.;4
Fantastic example of a beautiful period property, great staff and fantastic location. Gym is extensive and two good restaurants.  Staff are very helpful and pleasant, rooms are very clean and the a/c works great - essential when you visit NY on the hottest weekend of the year!;4
"I will offer a short and sweet review of this property.  I travel about 60 days a year on business/pleasure and this is a decent property worth staying at.  I have fairly high standards with lodging properties.  If you are a Universal Studios fan, it is walking distance from Universal Hollywood and City Walk.  If you are a ""Hollywood"" fan, the property is only a $15 cab ride from many of the Hollywood tourist areas.  If you fly into LAX, take out a second mortgage as the cab ride will set you back about $90.  But as for the actual hotel, the rooms are nice, the joint is clean and if you want a decent lodging property, you will likely be happy staying here.  On a scale from 1-10, this Hilton is a solid 8.....which means that most folks will be happy staying there.  I would";4
Love the location - right across the street from Lincoln Center, a couple of blocks to Columbus circle, lots of shopping and restaurants.  Very nice staff (most of the front desk staff, bar staff, and housekeepers - doormen not particularly friendly, in fact I didn't even realize they were doormen because they weren't really dressed in uniforms, and they just held the door open and didn't say anything.)  Rooms are very small - typical NYC.  We had a basic queen room - it had about 2 feet  on each side of the bed and about 2 feet at the end of the bed to the desk and bench.  The bathroom was tiny - you have to close the door in order to use the toilet and there is no counter space for your stuff, though there are some shelves over the toilet to use.   The decor is nice in the;4
We got a great deal on a room and we really enjoyed our stay. But we did not think it would have been worth the regular price.  Everything in the room cost extra even water or coffee and the elevator was really slow! But it was clean and the location was perfect. And the bed was really comfortable;4
I adored their Housekeeping staff, Rodney. He was very attentive to detail and even was kind enough to offer me more of their amenities. Room service was a bit slow though, but the food was also great in quality;4
We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. It is an ideal base for Midtown attractions within walking ie the Empire State Building, Macyâs, Times Sq, Rockefeller Building, Sax on fifth. Bus or subway will get you to the downtown attractions such as 9/11 ground zero, Statue of Liberty, Wall St and more.  The hotel itself is steeped in history and remains faithful to that history with its decor.  In its basement there is a small museum outlining the hotels historic past.  Great place to stay.;4
After an awful stay of only one night  in Royal Park (AKA the dump!)  258 West 97th Street NYC, we called in to Days Hotel to Book a room. The man on reception was more than helpful.  He let us call central reservations and told us that he would upgrade our room at no extra cost.  He gave us a choice of 2 rooms or a suite. Obviously we went for the suite!  Thanks Rudy!!! What could have been an awful experience became something special.;4
It was a kind of apartment actually.They do not clean the room and change the sheets everyday.As far as I remember if you request they give you new sheets evey 3 days.We have stayed for seven nights with 11 months baby ,we have everthing in the kitchen a kettle ,a cooker, a microwave, a  little refrigerator so it wan't a matter perapere to her baby foof in the middle of the night.Also there were tv and dvd player in the room. Location is great near the Broadway St. and 2 minutes to a big(central) metro station so it was easy to go everywhere with a little baby. It is a fact that they offer only clean room ,not so muh service.Our flight was in the evening and they requested from us an extra money to keep our luggages for a few hours after check out. Anyway I plan to stay in Woogo;4
Terrific stay at the New Yorker - what a historic hotel! We really enjoyed the history display in the basement and just being in such a place. The hotel has been renovated nicely and the staff was courteous and helpful. We were quite comfortable and will definitely come back. Thank you!;4
"The best feature of this Hilton is its location.  If you are visiting Universal Studios/Citywalk, they are a only short walk from the hotel.  Very convenient for families who want to take a break during the day.  The hotel is also a short drive (about 10 minutes) down to Hollywood and Highland, for the Chinese Theater, Hollywood tours, Madame Tussaud's, etc. so it makes a good base.  The hotel itself is fairly typical for a Hilton.  Very good service by the staff.  The rooms are pleasantly decorated though not very large. The upper floors have nice views over the Hollywood hills and Universal Studios.  Avoid paying extra for the Executive Floor unless you are security conscious to a paranoid degree; this hotel does not have an Executive Lounge, so your ""benefit"" is that the";4
Having read the numerous terrible reviews on here, but having a non refundable reservation we were very sceptical and worried about two main things that popped on previous reviews: A) Our room being given way, B) Bed Bugs  We arrived at the hotel around 4pm - the hotel had our names on the system and the room was ready - just a matter of picking up keys and paying the rest of the amount. Receptionist gave us our keys, let us take our things up and check everything over before we had to come down and settle the balance.   The bed bugs reviews made us take a couple of our own blankets, just ones to put down on the bed before we went sleep (airline ones will do) - but room was cleaned, bed was made and towels changed every day.  Sheets did have stains on them so they look like they;4
The Empire Hotel is not fancy, but it is clean and friendly and reasonable for New York City.  The rooms are small, but that is typical of New York.  It is right across the street from Lincoln Center which makes it a great spot if you are going there.;4
Without free wifi and breakfast, I'm only able to give it 4 out of 5. The location is perfect for your stay at Manhattan, beds are one of a kind and you are within walking distance to Lower Central Park. Starbucks as your nearest neighbor, the best way to start your day;4
The location is good. A couple of stops on the subway $3 or 15 min walk to times square. Very helpful staff  room was very clean. Roof top is lovely but happy hour on Thursdays doesn't extend there. Lobby is beautiful and good wi fi.We had the most amazing cheesecake at the Italian over the road, try it!  Highly recommend  a stay here.;4
Firstly I booked it cheapest through the actual hotel, and giving you gifts to like discount on trips and shopping.  Had a updated newer room, no complaints at all. Bed amazing, furnishings were good, so much space in a 2x Queen. Ask for a corner room you get double windows.  Iâve stayed in many hotels in NYC but this one really beat all the rest and its mainly down to the staff. A lot of NY hotels get a bad rep as staff being real New Yorkers are rude and miserable. Iâm pretty sure these staff were New Yorkers and all of them were great. It was pride weekend when I stayed so it was crazy busy but each staff member still made you feel special an acknowledge you in a crowd. ! I would most def stay again.  Donât bother with the diner next door found hair in food, across the street;4
Staff were welcoming and very helpful. Comfortable bed but the room was too hot. Bathroom was tiny but the shower was hot and powerful. Hotel needs a fresh coat of paint. Great location but the street could get noisy.  Bar/restaurant/products in the room were over-priced.;4
First of all, location-wise this was pretty much perfect for me and my girlfriend as she was running the NY Marathon and we needed somewhere close to the finish line.  Being situated one block away from Central Park, we found the location of the hotel to be ideal. Its also within walking distance of 5th Avenue and many shops and attractions.  The hotel was very clean and relatively spacious ( as much as it gets in Manhattan ) after we got a free upgrade from the very helpful Julia at reception who made us feel very welcome after our journey from Ireland.  She must have took pity on us, but in any case she was just the type of person we needed to be greeted by after a long journey, she was a brilliant ambassador for the hotel.  i had read before travelling that the lifts were a;4
Stayed for 5 nights for a conference.  Value of room was great! Rooms were very cleaned and cleaned well everyday.  All staff was courteous and friendly even sending up chocolate covered strawberries when they learned I was pregnant and had been traveling most of the day.  Food and room service were excellent and well priced for the type and location of the hotel.  We were able to walk to Universal Studios and city walk everyday,which was nice.  In the end we would definitely stay here again!;4
For an older hotel, we had a great stay.  It is right downtown and the beds are excellent.  The room size was ample compared to newer hotels we have stayed in.  Watch out for the internet and gym.  They charge you!;4
Booked through Kayak and happily surprised by the location, lobby, room and also the warm welcome by Pasquale at the front desk.  Lobby bar is busy and decor is fun!  Close to Lincoln Center, Central Park, and Juilliard. Intimate rooms with good lighting!;4
March 29 th , our kids sent us to New york city for my first visit and my husbands fifth. They put us up at the Empire Hotel. What a great place to stay. We were right near Central Park and received such good service. Yuri & Chris helped my daughter Ashli set up a wonderful experience. We were treated like kings. We are both battling cancer and this trip was our first vacation in well over 10 years. Zunachy and the rest of the front desk staff enjoyed hearing our adventures each time we returned to the hotel and every request we had so answered right away. Whether it was needing extra ice or getting extra linen....it was handled. Chris set us up for a lovely anniversary dinner at the Mandarin Oriental. We will definitely stay there again when we come to New york. Maid service on;4
We have now stayed at this  hotel three times. We have been lucky in that each room has been recently remodeled and each was clean. While I don't stay at hotels for the breakfast, this one is really good so it saves money for that. The key to this hotel is staying in an interior room.  It  is much quieter. My only complaint is a sometimes unhelpful, rude front desk staff. A few were friendly but most were standoffish at best. I still like the location and have just booked it again for April, 2013.;4
1st visit to New York and expected rooms to be on the small side at it is a city hotel, we had a metro double and space wasnt too bad but there is a lack of storage and bathrooms tiny but realistically how long do you intend to spend in your room. The beds were comfy, the staff were pleasant and liked the security at the lift area. The location is spot on can walk everywhere and subway right outside. Tic Toc dinner was great for breakfast. I loved the history of this hotel and yes it is not the newest and brightest hotel but that just adds to the overall atmosphere, would definitely stay here again;4
For the price and location, this was a great choice.  We were close to subway, lots of restaurants, Central Park, and Hudson River.  What more could we ask for?;4
This is actually quite a nice looking hotel, was clean and didn't look dated, the pool area was lovely place to relax in, in the hot sun. The rooms were fresh and clean and the bed was comfortable, the room was noisy though, there is a massive air con unit on the roof outside overlooking the court yard,making noise 24/7!! needed ear plugs to get any sleep and some guests staying there were very loud during the night, with a lot of arguing every night and slamming doors at 3am!!  But anyway Breakfast was excellent. good variety of food, with selection of cereals, freshly made omelette and eggs, turkey sausage, hash browns, and freshly made waffles which were so lush! blueberry or chocolate waffles so yummy.. Coffee, teas, juice, selection of cold meats, cheeses and pastries as;4
The staff were friendly but when asked to have our room cleaned and the reception making a note of our room, we came back to the room not being cleaned which meant our towels were damp and still in the bath, disappointing to have confirmation that the room would be cleaned to find out it wasn't. The bed was also not very comfy and duvet was lumpy.;4
The Jane is in a perfect location if you love to shop and hang out at hipster bars and restaurants. Also right next to the waterfront with a path perfect for running. The two of us, 30 somethings, shared a cabin room (floor space exactly large enough to sit one suitcase down and stand next to it) which was fine since we only slept a few hours both nights we stayed. The shared bathrooms were not very clean and we have a high tolerance for dirty shared facilities. This is no place for a claustrophobic. Within 1/2 mile is Bleecker St., main subway lines, PATH and amazing dining. For the price, can't be beat but next time we will pony up for a private bath.;4
Nice hotel, quiet, easy to access universal. Not so easy to get to other places, we used Uber a lot. Nice room, bed a tad hard for me, terrible soft feather pillows, compress to thin and firm as soon as you put your head down. They need a pillow menu with more choice like latex and memory foam. Reception staff are lovely and helpful . Restaurant is nice but expensive .;4
We stayed here one night, because we were only 18 hours in Newyork. At the Check-in there was a very friendly man who gives us a free upgrade. We loved the room. It was a larger room than we booked but for a european person it is a normal size. The location of the hotel is perfect!! Near CentralPark!! The staff is very nice and helpfull. If I go back than I will book this hotel again because of the price/quality and location..;4
Overall this hotel is pretty good. The location is great if wanting to see the sights or other cities due to its close location to Penn station. Times Square is only about 15 mins walk away. The rooms are all clean and have an Art Deco charm. British traveller be warned. The hotel will add an extra $25 a day for facility charges which may not be used. This was not explained clearly on checking in. I think the management should review this policy.;4
I have stayed in this hotel twice in the last 2 months, 3 nights on both occasions. I am happy with - the neighborhood - noise level (very quiet) - cleanliness (inside the room) - proximity to subway stop (specially, express 2/3 lines)  NOT happy with  - WiFi (signal is very poor, worthless) - Coffee (in-room coffee tastes awful)  I do not know about the Gym..not sure there is 1 ! The common area look dated, worn out...but I am ok with that;4
Room & amenities: The room was small but definitely cosy and most importantly clean with modern finishings. There was an Ipod dock at the vanity desk and some other products for sale for people who left their things back home (e.g. emergency kit, love kit). Wifi is not free. However, the room I got happened to be able to receive the free wifi signal and hence, I manage to surf the internet from the comfort of my room.  Location: A less than 5minutes walk from Columbus Circle Station/Trump International Hotel & Tower. Was there during Christmas and the Columbus Circle Station had a Christmas market there. Convenient location if you're looking for somewhere near the subway. The area seems pretty safe too as we walked back after midnight on several occasions.   Walked (along 9th or;4
Dena at the front desk is awesome!!! In fact everyone was very nice! It was a little loud the first night. However after that was okay. The room I was in was a bit dated but large. The price was good and even though the neighborhood was a little sketchy in parts I walked around with no problem. It is a convenient ride away to Universal Studios etc.;4
I picked this hotel for my stay in NYC because of the history it holds and the Art Deco design.  The lobby was smaller than I thought it would be, but was impressive all the same.  The staff at check in would friendly and let me got up to my room before the normal check in time.  The rooms are smaller, like in most NYC hotels and were probably used as offices back when it was built.  I had my own thermostat and actually had a pretty nice view out the window.  The water pressure in the bathroom was amazing and there was plenty of hot water.  My only complaints were the carpeting in the rooms and halls were old and a bit nasty and the halls were extremely dim.  They need to do a few renovations to make the whole experience top notch.;4
Wonderful staff!  They go out of their way to help you. Rooms with queen size beds are tiny. Rooms could use updating but comfortable. Beds are comfortable. All meals and mini bar are extra. Wifi is extra in your room but free in Lobby.  Walking distance to Central Park, Lincoln Center across the street and close proximity to Broadway Shows. Lots of great restaurants and a Walgreens on the corner. Always a pleasure to come back for a visit!;4
We brought our youngest son here for his 18th birthday and stayed at The New Yorker. We arrived on the red eye and since it was only 8am we had the hotel keep our bags for us (no charge) while we had breakfast at the Tick Tock. Great meal! After breakfast the staff informed us our rooms were ready! So great! We settled our things and were off. So many things to see so close by. If you choose to go to the top of the Empire State bldg definitely choose the priority pass that enables you to skip the lines and go right up. SO much faster!! It's crowded up there regardless but such amazing views! We saw a concert at Madison Square Garden, again within easy walking distance. Walked to see a broadway show and never felt unsafe there are SO many people at all times of day/evening that;4
Located in walking distance from Universal Studios (our friends nevertheless took the shuttle - 100 deg F!). Everything is there to make it a Hilton. Very friendly reception manager who accommodated us for a specific request. Beautiful rooms. So why not a 5 rating? Well we are traveling for 20 days and can compare value for money. Compared to Marriott's Anaheim, the price here is more than double while quality is identical.;4
stayed 7 nights there in may 2016. We were really amazed by the quality and the atmosphere of this place. we slept in bunk beds in a room which look like a boat room but it was comfy for the price. and the hotel is really well located in the greenwich village, in manhatan. Chelsea market is next door as well. One more thing the hotel have a rooftop with bar and stunning view. this place have a really cool nightclub dowstairs which bring all the fency people from manhatan who are looking for nice party. So if you are looking for a good hotel with good location and good deal the Jane is for you.  And special thanks to daniel  and all the friendly staff.;4
I went to LA with a friend & it was the first time both of us had visited - I must say it was THE best holiday i've ever had...LA is fantastic, i love it & would live there if I could! The Hotel...ok well it really was a lovely hotel - clean, comfortable with HUGE rooms, we had a massive double bed each & a very large bathroom. There were also sliding doors on to a patio which was nice though we didn't use it. It was very quiet with no traffic noise. The hotel has a swimming pool too & a nice restaurant downstairs which we only used for breakfast - yummy...plenty of choice & it set us up for the day. Location was probably the only downfall as it is a fair way from the centre of hollywood (Graumanns Chinese theatre, madame tussauds & kodak theatre etc...) & I wouldn't recommend;4
Diagonally across the street from Pen Station, it is close to all the necessities of transportation in and out of Manhattan.  Easy walk to many attractions including Times Square, Empire State Building, the UN and Lincoln center (all are about a mile to a mile-and-a-half.  Plus the subway station is just downstairs.  Nice rooms without huge prices.  Good service and clean well kept and updated facility.  We will use it many more times as NYC is about a once a year trip to see family.;4
Charming decor, extremely friendly staff and a great deal. The attached cafe is delicious and they offer room service without any exorbitant charges (which is fantastic on those mornings when you are hungry but maybe stayed up a little late the night before...). The communal bathrooms were always clean, and the little touches in the little room (water, nice TV, radio and iPod docking station, etc) made it a comfortable place to kick back after a long day. I didn't get a chance to check out the rooftop or the lounge but I have heard good things! Also a great location, close to The High Line, shops, restaurants, and more!  It would be nice if there communal bathrooms weren't unisex, however, that said, I had no issues with it while I was there...so really just a minor thing! Also;4
I usually read reviews before I book anything. I've read that people were not that excited about the hotel itself but liked the location. We really liked the location too.you walk to universal studio and you can be there right when they open and stay as late as you want and you don't have to be worried about paying or finding parking to go to the studio. The lobby is nice and buffet breakfast was great!  The hotel itself is not luxury or high end but not that bad either.  We liked it for just the location and breakfast;4
Close to the Festivsl Hall & the London Eye,. Clean, quiet room at the back. Sunny day, so had a lovely time strolling & taking photos. Slightly spoilt by rude staff & abrupt Manager on 12/112022(the morning after our 1 night stay)  The staff member did not admit her mistake or apologise for getting our paid breakfast wrong/instead said we must've given her the wrong room number. We had not! Refund given by a very abrupt female Manager, who needs to be trained to speak more politely to paying guests!!;4
Sunday room service was not up to scratch - was told complimentary water was provided everyday so we didn't buy any on Sunday but they were not provided on that day. Likewise no replacement coffee/tea pods for the machine on that day, & were replenished only on one other day during our 4 nights there. Otherwise, room was comfortable and quiet. Reception staff were helpful.;4
The hotel is in a great location, very central. The staff are great, especially Mohammid on reception.  Rooms are a little dated but the beds are so comfortable . Our room had a fantastic view. We were given a complimentary room upgrade and a bottle of wine. Would most definitely stay there again;4
Very good location. Very clean and well maintained hotel. Friendly staff. AC very noisy, not possible to set the temperature, it's very cold. Inexistent storage space in the bathroom, even for the normal personal items.;4
Great, friendly staff, nice, comfortable corner room.  Hotel overall was quiet and nicely decorated, and the lobby was a nice place to chill and hang out.  Made our five-night NYC get-away a great one, thank you!;4
A good and honest hotel. Not special. Location, location, location!! They could have updated it last year. Stil an  old and a kind of ugly wall paper. Price is OK.  roof top is fantastic! Try to have brealfest over there.;4
I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Jane, set in the beautiful West village of Manhattan. I was greeted with a warm smile by the entire staff. I shared a room with a bunk bed for two which was very charming and quaint. Though it was quite small, it had all the necessary amenities and storage under the bead, so the space issue quickly became obsolete. The room did not have a private bathroom, but I would recommend the experience even to those who like their privacy. The showers and bathrooms are well closed off to the rest of the washroom area, and they even provide bathrobes and slippers to walk around the hallways. The cafe on the main floor is also great, serving breakfasts, snacks and coffee all day. I also took advantage of the free bike rentals the hotel offers;4
I enjoyed staying at this hotel, the decoration is very stylish, I really loved the room interior and the bed was so comfy. Very clean and the photos correspond with the real view. It also has a small gym which is a little bonus for those who like to keep fit.:) Located near Times Square and easy access to the main parts of the city. The only thing I didn't like was that the room service sometimes come later in the afternoon.;4
Staff is friendly as we have stayed there the last two years over the holidays.  We enjoy the location and the Starbucks, workout facility, etc.  The hotel has great communication with the guests and there are many options to take advantage of.  We recommend the hotel to anyone looking to spend not only the holidays but other times there.;4
The concierge (Chris) at the Empire Hotel was amazing! He make our special day even better than we could've thought possible.  The room was small and the 3pm check in was a little ridiculous but all round not a bad hotel.;4
We stay at the New Yorker every year for the Westminster Dog Show. The staff is always wonderful. They have many different room types. If it is not overly busy, they allow you to check out your room before checking in. We love the rooms with two bathrooms! The bathrooms are not large, but having two saves marriages! A short walk to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Times square. My husband loves the Tic Tock Diner as it is open 24 hours with good food and he can order breakfast any time of day. Great cheesecake too.;4
Stayed here for five nights while on girls trip to NYC.Perfect location, just down the street from Empire state building and Macy's.Great 24 hr diner in the hotel, serving great food and cocktails. Hotel staff were very friendly. Rooms a little small but very clean and suitable. Right across from Madison square garden. Subway and bus stops right beside the hotel so really a great hotel location for everything. Only four subway stops from Yankee Stadium.;4
After visiting the US for 3 weeks, we decided to stay at the Hyatt on our last night. Itâs very convenient as it was right next to the hotel for our flight the next morning. It was super modern and very clean. The bathroom and shower were a decent size along with the room itâs self.   The only problem I would say is that you could be restricted with your food options if you wanted an evening meal. (we did  end up eating from the hotel) Basically to park at their multi-storey over night it was around $17 which was fine. But we queried taking our car out and the lady at the desk said that it would cost us $35 to have a pass that would let you in and out which seems ridiculous?! Surely she would have gotten this wrong.   Other than that we had a lovely comfortable stay for our last;4
Great location for universal and shuttle service there and back was awesome.  They happened to be going through significant renovations but for the most part worked around that pretty well. Did this only Hilton points so can't beat that kind of price.;4
Good hotel: It's not the nicest neighbourhood for a hotel to be situated in, but in no way is it dangerous. I found the staff to be very helpful, even sometimes going out of there way to help.  The hotel is in a great location, near to Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard and the Staples Center.;4
I was in NYC with my wife (late 40s) for a second city break, for 4 days.  Good: The hotel is old and outdated and needs a full refit. Some will see that as bad, but I love the old Art Deco styling (see photos) Staff were very helpful Lifts were good. Like 5-6 for floors 1-20 and other side for 21-40. Only had a longish wait once. On-site restaurant food is good, as is the ticktock diner, albeit expensive. Location is excellent, certainly from transport perspective. Penn station is round corner which is a main hub. You can get easily to JFK via airtrain, LIRR, subway Beds are amazing, so comfortable, we both  had great sleeps  Bad: Rooms very small. We 'upgraded' to a room with a view. Not sure about that! Not a fault with hotel per se, but the area stinks of weed. Like every;4
Hotel is center of more or less everything. Very close to Central Park and Time Square, Car Rentals and 5th Avenue. Stuff is helpful. Guys working in the door were very friendly.  didn't try breakfast , just look and decide to explore out. Many options close to hotel. Room was noisy due to street and floor is just 3rd. Ask to get upper floors. Room is really small compare to all my travels around the world. Not easy to walk if you keep open your luggage on the floor.;4
Built around 1903 this lovely hotel is an unusual combination of old and new. Rooms were clean and our room was large enough for 2 queen beds and a rollaway. The beds were comfy. They have a nice pool area.  There was a complimentary buffet breakfast served downstairs that had plenty of choices including chef-cooked omelets and waffles. Towards the end of the serving times sometimes the staff dont always keep the pastry trays full but serving times are pretty generous so most people are done anyway. Typical American coffee is available (awful) but that's not the fault of the hotel- seems it's the standard in the US  On the negative side, the bathroom was very small. And the rollaway bed was relatively expensive ($40 pn) compared to other places we've stayed. You have to pay for;4
Had a good stay for a week here. The best part was the morning breakfast until 10:30. Hugo was great and makes the best omelets around. Close to the metro. The only negative was that even if you have the do not disturb sign on the door cleaning service will come in anyway so don't bother.;4
My wife and I recently had a fabulous week in Marrakech, staying at the Riad. The ladies at the Reception canât do enough for you and the restaurant recommendations and cooking course arranged were highlights. We loved the fruit around the Riad and tea whenever we wanted it. Thanks for a great week.;4
The location is good for access to Hollywood and the Valley.  Great location if Uni studios is your destination.  It's nice having the restaurants at Citywalk within walking distance.  The hotel is pretty whatever.  Competent but not inspiring.  The decor is very 1980's.  Wallpaper looks old,  Furniture works but there's no sense of style.  Exec floors have many b-guys there with families and kids taking advantage of typical Hilton C-Level Carb breakfasts.  This is my fallback hotel for LA if things go bad somewhere else.  Showers work.  Internet works.  Parking is adequate.;4
I know that there are very fine hotels in New York and have stayed at a few of them. This hotel is what I would call reliable for my needs and I have stayed there about 10 times. The location is extraordinary, directly across from the Lincoln Center and an easy walk to dozens of restaurants,shopping and nightlife. The area is very safe and its only a few blocks from Central Park. I always stay there for business, but it is often full of European tourists, so its kind of fun. The bar is good and so is the restaurant. The rooms are interesting and, yes, often in need of a little maintenance, but I have never had a bad experience. All in all, I like the hotel and the staff is always courteous and helpful.;4
I stayed for a whole week and a lot happened at the hotel, from a lady knocking on my window to cold showers. I was disturbed by a lady who was âlocked outâ when I asked to move rooms, Gustavo helped me get the accommodation i needed to enjoy the rest of my stay. The shower was still cold, But they did try to fix it each time I called;4
I absolutely loved it here the staff made me feel so welcome in fact it was a bit emotional when I was leaving.  I would most definitely go back the rooms are basic and clean but the hotel is also central to the trains buses and shops.  Not to mention the great Central Park across the road.  This was my best birthday ever.;4
This place is fine.  Not really near any amenities but only 3  blks. from subway.  Modern, functional and clean.  Absolutely OK!;4
I only stayed for a short time but I can say that I give it 2 thumbs up. It is locayed very close to the centre and to bus/train station, open 24 hours, rooms are very conformable and an affordable price :);4
Booked this room before reading the reviews based on location and price - right on the 1-2-3 Subway line, safe neighbourhood, reasonable walking distance to a lot of cool stuff. The staff were very friendly and efficient: while I was having issues with my cc company, the desk staff took care of multiple other guests and their issues, and still handled my problems in a courteous manner.  We had a couple of issues (we were there during the blizzard after New Year's, and there were heating problems and telephone problems) that were dealt with as soon as we reported them. The room was comfortable (the beds were perfect for us) if not a little dated and could use some sprucing up. But this didn't get in the way of our experience. Check-out was quick and easy.  For a hotel on the UWS;4
Came into town for a concert at MSG. Wanted a hotel within walking distance of the arena...found The New Yorker and what a lovely choice !! Spacious lobby with an art deco motif. Front desk staff were very polite , professional and accommodating. We were given an upgrade and the room was very lovely......modern, updated and the bathroom, tho small ,was tastefully done.....glass wall step in shower, vessel sink, etc. Nice restaurant attached to the lobby serving meals 24/7....great breakfast !! I would highly recommend The New Yorker to anyone visiting NYC wanting a centrally located hotel !;4
We chose The Empire from approx 50 Hotels based mainly on the location to Central Park and the Roof Top Bar. The location did not disappoint. Overall the Hotel was clean and the staff very friendly. we did not eat in the Hotel so cannot comment on the food. The roof Top Bar was fairly full considering we were out of season and many tables had 'Reserved' on them even though we arrived there at about 6pm (so book early) we were not informed about the Hotel Bars (the Lobby Bar was closed one day until about 5pm) when we arrived but generally you can work things out as you go. The Lobby staff were friendly and were happy to have photos taken (providing they did not seem to be shurking their responsibilities) New Yorkers are very proud and they love their city - which did not;4
Stayed only one night as a last minute treat visit to NYC. Loved the deco fixtures and fittings in the room and the decor of the hotel. Staff very friendly and it is worth paying for a room with a view of the skyline. Only downside the rooms are small and no Mr Coffee machine. Would stay there again!;4
The hotel is in a great location, surrounded by stores, restaurants and entertainment. This hotel was a very nice surprise.  Though the exterior is being renovated (seems like most of the city is under repair), the interior is quite lovely - art deco style - very well preserved and maintained from the 1930's. Our room was updated, clean and very comfortable.  The only negative is the bathroom was rather small.  Also very convenient is a diner with an entrance from the hotel lobby. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly.  As a Wyndham Rewards member I was quite pleased with this hotel and would definitely return.;4
Housing plans in NYC changed last minute leaving us stranded for a place. It's not totally fancy and what not- it was small generally clean and cozy. Astor on the park was a great cheap last minute fix for my roommate and I as we explored NYC. It's located directly across from the upper east corner or Central Park. There's a little corner deli that's convenient for a quick bite. Although it is your typical shack deli- crowded and people just trying to get by all in all good cheap little spot. Although we only had one key to the room, it was no biggie. The staff and owner were very nice, helpful and accommodating.;4
Great location, great service. Originally booked a metro view double room online . When we got to the room the view was somewhat obscured by scaffolding. Spoke to the front desk and they agreed to move us the next morning as soon as another room was cleaned. Second room was much nicer and clear view of Empire State Building. Would have do rated 5 if we had the view room for the whole week.;4
It's the staff that make the difference here.  The facility needs help, although it is kept reasonably clean.  The location is either great (quiet, off-the-beaten-track, directly across from Central Park, relatively quiet) or mediocre (removed from most of the popular tourist attractions) depending on what you seek.  I arrived by car just as a parking space become available across the street, and the front desk lady ran out and stood in it to hold it for me so I wouldn't need to pay for parking.  And that was before I'd even arrived.  Rooms are very small, but if you only plan to sleep here and be out working or playing all day, this is a great stop.  Staff are happy to hold bags before or after your check-in(-out).  They try to do anything they can to be helpful.  This is not;4
Good hotel at a perfect location. At arrival Julia gave us a free upgrade, so we had a very nice welcome. The rooms are clean and the staff were helpfull. The room was good, only the bathroom needed some minor maintenance.;4
Having a late check-in at the hotel our first impression was not very good. Kind of rude answers and service was not present. Just put your creditcard here..   Dispite this experience the room was satisfactory, but noisy due to high traffic outside.  And the breakfast was good, especially the amazing service of Hugo, an employee that served not only a great omelet but with an amazing smile and caring for his guests!   Hugo, mucho gracias!!;4
Located right next to Universal Studios & CityWalk, they provide the familiar Hilton standard with plush quality rooms & friendly staff from the valet to the manager. Our double room had 2x queen beds, armchair, large desk, & an amazing mobile device charger that had 10+ different connectors all for $180 daily. Buffet breakfast were traditional (western) & Asian to cater for the Chinese market. You would only stay here to go to Universal as the surrounding areas are not worth visiting and it's too far from downtown compared to other large. I recommend staying at least 2 nights to ensure you get to see all the attractions without feeling rushed.;4
It was a nice room the tv was outdated tho lol the other one had a flat screen smart tv and a mini fridge;4
We were given a complimentary upgrade on arrival and the room was huge.2 double beds and loads of space.Fantastic view of Empire State,didn't get disturbed by any street noise.Bathroom was large and a very powerful shower Free calls back to UK(when I say free did have to pay $29 a night resort fee). Room was very quiet with no noise from any other guests,only complaint was I had to ring every day for tea/coffee pods as these were never replenished in the more.I did mention it to the maid one day and she said it wasn't her it was housekeeping???? Will continue to recommend this hotel and stop again. We were in room 3617;4
Sooo... We had read all the reviews and were prepared, we thought, for the size of the room and the shared bathroom. However, in reality the rooms are smalllllll, I mean teeny tiny. We could both stand up in the bunk bed cabin room, or both be in bed. It was impossible to do anything in the room unless one of us left. After the first night and recovered from the jet lag it was actually quite funny and we war med to it. The beds are comfy if small. The bats, rooftop and ballroom are fabulous, as is the rest of the decor and building. Unfortunately both venues were closed for photo shoots or private parties most of the time we were there. Also good to know is that the cafe is closed although this is not clear on the website. Maybe that's why they have complimentary coffee and;4
My experience list I was much better than the last. We parked at the hotel parking overpass to get to Universal Studios. Meadow Walk at most.  I had a bad experience so I chose to opt out this time for points. The room was comfortable and clean.  Toilet made a lot of weird noise when others were using it next door.  Tile off of the bathroom fell but we just put our trash can in front of it.   The Marriott at Burbank is probably still my favorite because they give you a hot breakfast if you are a gold/ platinum.  Parking is cheaper and there is a VIP lounge which I enjoy.  Runs a free shuttle to Universal Studios.;4
We were needing a central location  for sight seeing, which this was, and also needed two beds, so we ended up at the New Yorker.  It says it has been refurbished, and in many ways it has, but my husband was disappointed in the very small bath with no in room coffee machine, no fridge, and broken porcelain in bathroom fixtures.  It was as if they re-did some aspects and left others.  However, the staff are great, and it is convenient having a diner open 24 hrs downstairs (food not great but OK).  We had  27 th floor with amazing views of NYC;4
"We stayed in one of the larger ""Captain's Cabin"" style rooms for six nights.  The room was a reasonable size, well appointed and clean.  We actually ate several ""picnic"" suppers at the table and chairs set provided  On the down side, the room was located on the west side of the hotel overlooking a very busy street.  Traffic noise was constant and loud.  Fortunately my spouse and I each travel with Bose noise cancelling ear buds.  It is not the most convenient thing to have to wear them at night, but they sure worked to deaden the noise.  If you are bothered by traffic noise it would be wise to find out if you can book the type of room you wish and have a quite location.  We appreciated the fact that the hotel is located away from the throngs of tourists and over the six days";4
Our room was on the 2nd floor and they are still renovating the floor. While the sleeping area of the room was well-appointed and renovated, the bathroom was only partially redone. The neighborhood the hotel is in could be considered a little sketchy and I don't know that I would be comfortable walking around there at night. Limited options in terms of restaurants in the area, but many places will deliver and the hotel has provided a binder with menus, etc. in the room. Parking is off-street and secured.;4
We checked in late and choices in our rooom category were limited so Mr. Ze gave us a free upgrade to ensure we would have a quiet room.  Love the location (literally a half block from Lincoln Center with lots of reasonable ethnic restaurants in the area), found the room very, very comfortable, and very attractively furnished with a very comfortable bed.  Just a few blocks from the subway, too.;4
At first I stayed in the room and thought this place was a total dump, and I got depressed.  But then I hit the subway (5 min walk) had a nice dinner near Times Sq (10 min ride on subway) and was in a better mood afterwards.  The hotel is a blast from the past...accept that an d you should be OK.  It has old charm, and thats a good thing.  Hotel is clean, no frills, and under $100 on the upper west side..and the neighborhood is great.  Ironically, I tried to call travelocity to cancel my reservation when I first got there, but it did grow on me later on!  I would go back.;4
Aside from above, staff were helpful, polite and friendly. Complimentary breakfast and wi-fi were very useful. However, unlike other guests who reviewed the hotel,  parking was charged and this was surprising in America.;4
Stayed for 3 nights room only. Rooms are clean, providing everything you need. Breakfast available but we ate in local cafes. The hotel offers complimentary tea & coffee but actually this is only available in the morning, which is a bit mean as other hotels provide it. Staff are great in reception, very helpful. Beauty of this hotel is that it's pretty central, near the underground and walking distance of many attractions.;4
"I understand that these rooms get a lot of traffic, but out room was ""tired"".  Carpet was probably 6-8 months overdue for replacement.  Wall paper was close to gross in spots.  Room was as clean as it possibly got be. Staff was awesome, stay was nice, kids loved pool area.";4
Just returned after staying here for two nights. Hotel is 3 mins from Times Square, location is perfect for Broadway too.  Staff is very kind and friendly and super helpful. I emailed them a week before we arrived and asked a room with a view on the upper floor and they did everything we asked for. So thank you again for that.  There are some complimentary tea and coffee in the morning and some snack after 4. Room was basic but perfectly fine. It was clean, only the windows would need more regular cleaning.  It is a bit tired so that is why I have the 4 stars but the building is beautiful.  I wouldnât hesitate to stay here again  Thank you;4
The service is out of this world. Got a free room upgrade as soon as I arrived. Room and shower are very comfortable. The only (small) downside is the noise from Broadway Street.  Close to subway stations. One block away from Central Park. Walkable distance from Times Square, Theatre District, Top of the Rocks, etc...;4
In a junior suite,  the room was a good size for three of us and it was very clean. Great view of Columbus Circle. The lamp shade tattered, tables had blotches and stains...needs some TLC but we were very comfortable in the room. Overall location is perfect! We will be staying here again and will try the next up size suite.;4
Firstly, the location of this hotel is brilliant and really one of the best areas of New York. Around the corner you have bars, restaurants, the high line and streets you can spend hours walking around.   I will get the negatives out of the way first - housekeeping.  Probably the worst housekeeping I've ever had (and we travel A LOT).  Effort was minimal (first night they didn't service the room until 6pm then didn't give us toilet paper which we had run out of, didn't empty the full bins etc). Our soaps and shampoos were not refilled until day 5 of our 7 day stay.  Ok, so nothing major but disappointing. Especially giving we were still paying a good amount of money for our stay there.  We knew from reviews rooms were not big.  We had a captains cabin on the third floor.  The;4
Nice hotel but get ready for the extras. Wifi 7.5USD per device per day. Parking is between 20 and 24 USD per day so you may as well use the valet parking at 25USD per day. Universal citywalk is 10 minutes walk from the lobby.;4
I'll knock off one star only because the price, and the extras, were exorbitant. With that said, if you are willing to pay for movie star treatment, luxury and location, you'll get it all here.  Nestled into the Hollywood hills, this hotel is literally a five-minute walk from Universal Studios and CityWalk (and they offer a free shuttle), 10 minutes from the heart of Hollywood, and 10 miles (which can take an hour, easy, in LA traffic) from downtown and Dodger Stadium.  Our high-floor room had a view of the LA skyline on one side and Universal Studios on the other. Not an overly large room, for a family with kids, but the beds were comfortable. The pool, lobby and other public areas were all top-notch. The self parking was nice, for a family coming and going to see the sights;4
Very clean & nice looking hotel.  Room cleaned everyday and bed linen & towels changed.  Great location very close to theatres and Times Square.  Staff very friendly & drinks were reasonable in the hotel bar.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because we appeared to have the 2 smallest rooms on the floor with no street view which meant the room was always dark.;4
"Luis at front desk is awesome!  Our room was musty and without a view but Luis switched us easily to a beautiful room.  I've stayed here a couple of times before; very clean.  They could use more outlets near bedside and better bathroom lighting.  This is a great location-close to subway, Lincoln center, great shopping and many restaurants--and one of the best rooftop bars in NYC! If you plan on imbibing in your room, however, bring your own glassware!  Bartender in lobby lacked customer service skills.";4
Awesome location if visiting universal studio - only a 5 min walk. Highly recommend   Travelled from Australia stayed 1 night and it was good, staff are very friendly and helpful - we paid an extra 25usd for early check in this was amazing as we got there very early in the morning. Parking was 36usd plus taxes for a van. Room services was ok, food was average and very expensive- long wait time only to have the incorrect order brought up.  All in all itâs a lovely hotel and I will definitely stay here again;4
I just spent a weekend at this hotel with my wife and some friends for a NYC destination wedding. The rooms were clean, and quite large for NYC standards. The hotel is very nicely decorated, pretty moden and I would certainly recommend a stay here if you can get a good deal online. I think we paid close to $300 a night.  One word of WARNING is the bar man/servers at the roof top bar Its amazing in itself the prices of drinks, but what we found was that these 2 guys working the roof top bar on a Saturday afternoon were adding double gratuity onto our bill. So when they say tax and tip is included and dont itemize your bill make sure you take a good look at the final charge. I can only image how much money these guys make on a weekend from charging double gratuity. When we noticed;4
I arrived here with doubts about how I would be received having read other reviews on this hotel. Many of them could not be more wrong. This is not a luxury hotel BUT it is clean and comfortable and the staff (despite other posts) were friendly and helpful. I booked this hotel for a long weekend in LA. It's near the metro which takes you anywhere you want at a ridiculously low price and it is excellent value for money.;4
Hotel is across from Lincoln Center and in the middle of many restaurants.  The room was clean and well appointed but I could not regulate the heat.  It was 75 and above.    Also the desk staff is overwhelmed.    There should be more staff there or designated jobs.;4
We stayed for 4 nights in a suite on 40th floor (4005). The views were absolutely amazing. The bedroom windows views were onto the Empire State Building one way and the financial centre/downtown/ world trade centre the other way. For 4 days we loved every sunset and sunrise. The location is top!  The Trattoria in the hotel is handy, friendly service, good choice of food and drink and nice atmosphere. The gym was great too, everything you need in a hotel gym. There was an extra charge for wifi and ours didnt work for the first three days due to some network issues so the reception kindly cancelled the extra charge from our final bill. The suite itself was spacious but furniture slightly dated and tattered. For an extra $5 per luggage the hotel stores it for you while you check;4
Room (I had a standard room) was spacious and well designed.  Toilet was also good - no bathtub but not an issue for me.  Food at hotel was expensive but tasty.  Free water available in lobby and cafeteria.  Frequent free shuttle to LAX.;4
This hotel is the best compared to the same level as per cost of hotel we had been into. I  consider staff are honest as per what had been experienced when a counter staff returned back my money when I accidentally gave double the amount of what is required. They are very accommodating and very professional, special mention is staff Cecile, she'd helped us a lot on everything we need, also Oralia with her great omelets, waffles and friendly smiles.The hotel is complete of everything a traveler may need, faraway from more expensive hotels we've been and rooms are spacious. Being close to metro station  is another advantage, and for east aseans like us, restaurants like Thai, Chinese, Japanese and Filipino are available in the area close by. We are very happy on our nine days stay;4
Very nice woman at check-in. Lovely room, sensational view. Love the lobby bar for pre-show cocktail and snack, Perfect location for our night at the opera, especially considering the snowstorm! The only negative was that our room was too warm for cool sleeping and we couldn't open the window.;4
We booked the king corner room with a pull out sofa. Our room overlooked CityWalk which looked really beautiful at night. Carpet in the room appeared to be worn out. Washroom was beautiful, with a makeup area in one corner. Water pressure for the shower was very low but it seems like all hotels in LA are like this.   Shuttle from and to Universal CityWalk was great. Check in and check out was a breeze.;4
So my family and I stayed at the New Yorker in Manhattan (8th Ave) this past weekend (07/28/18-07/29/18). We were on the 31st floor, room 3108. 2 double beds, a tv, small bathroom and a very nice view. Because there are 5 of us ( 2 adults and 3 kids) I knew that the 2 double beds would not be enough so we took our air mattress since our 3 y.o. sleeps with my husband and me. I was happy to see that there was enough space to put the air bed so we all slept comfortably. All in all not a bad stay. We had a lovely time. Will post some pics here. Took these at the time we were leaving so please excuse the mess!;4
Ok, this location is right in the midst of Manhattan, hence the location name: Mid Town.  It's noisy, and even 22 floors up you can hear the subway.  However, the grand art deco entrance lobby is impressive and airy.  The staff were really helpful (but remember, they do earn money via tips, so it's in their interest to help you).  Our room was toasty and warm in the cold weather, and it turned out to be a suite with a bedroom with 2 double beds, a living room and 2 bathrooms.  Definite bonus.  If you walk outside and turn right, stand on the corner and look up to your left, you're right in the eyeline of the Empire State Building.;4
"you never know what a hotel listed on line as ""budget"" will be like, but the Empire was totally acceptable.  Extremely friendly and professional staff; the room was clean, the beds comfortable, the bathroom modern and clean.  Location can't be beat.";4
"Ok, it's a big and busy hotel, so the lobby will be full now and again, the bell hops busy on occasion and the check-in staff facing a queue from time-to-time. But in my experience the staff are friendly and efficient with ready smiles. Our room was way up high ... something like the 25th floor from memory. It was small (NY hotel rooms are generally small), but not too small for a couple and our 3 cases. But it was clean, it was quiet and we had an unobstructed view down 34th to The Empire State. The location is great. Right across from Penn Station, just down from the Empire State and not too far from one of my new NY ""faves"" The High Line. One word of warning - which we resolved without fuss while we were there - the check in staff tried to apply the resort fee of circa $25";4
Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights as a part of a America tour.  Great location  Rooms are good size and clean Comfy bed Safe in room - didn't use not sure if need to pay. Wi-Fi worked well no problems. Plenty of plus although not always visible.. usb plug was actually in the alarm clock. Free tea and coffee 7-11am I believe Friendly staff.  I would recommend this hotel, and would return.;4
Entering the hotel you immediately walk into an Art Deco lobby where you are greeted warmly by various people. Check in itself was easy and informative.  Our room was a decent size up on the 27th floor offering incredible views. The room was clean and well looked after daily.  We enjoyed breakfasts at the Tick Tock Diner (also excellent !) and the hotel was in easy reach of all the sights (or transport to them).  Would definitely recommend !;4
With only a 2 minute walk to Central Park, Times Square and with multiple subways around, we found this hotels location perfect.  The room itself was very big and the bathroom nice and clean. However, the room and lobby had a bad mosquito problem. We did buy a can of bug spray and that fixed the problem quickly though. All in all this was a great New York experience.;4
Had Event at Lincoln CTR, perfect for what we needed.  easy access to park, subway, shopping and food. Rooms comfortable, AC could be a little stronger, had to open windows to get air-one window did not function well.;4
Had a double room,  top floor,  which was great for my brother and I.  Great location. Subway nearby. The drinks  are pricey at the pool but its New York and the view was great, so that's the trade off.  The A/C wasn't that good but was good enough and we weren't miserable. I would stay here again.;4
I stayed for 5 nights. The place is cute, the restaurant is very nice, the staff is caring. The rooms are teeny-tiny, and youhave to share a bathroom--but for $99 a night in Manhattan it's a bargain.And how much time do you spend in your hotel room anyway? The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and I even parked on the the street. It's clean, no bugs, and the small rooms are well designed, with a great flat screen TV. Be aware that the beds are single size and very narrow by American standards.;4
I like the size of the hotel and the simplicity of staying there.  Clean comfortable beds, helpful and friendly staff.  Simple breakfast option. I gives me exactly what I need -  a clean, comfortable place to stay in a great location.;4
Good place to stay for a brief transit or stay in LA.  Not great for family vacation.  Was expecting my upgrade to a suite with 2 queen beds but did not get it.  The restaurant at the hotel is nothing fancy.  We had to Uber to a local restaurant for a descent dining food.;4
We had a room just 3 rooms away from the supposed bed bug room up on the 10th floor. Had NO problems with bugs at all. The room had a huge view of Lincoln Center. The hotel room was not large (a King Superior) but plenty of room to move around, a comfortable chair and small desk. Bathroom was a bit on the small side, but had L'Occitane shampoos, conditioners, etc.. Shower stayed hot through 2 showers each day (I had read otherwise on a review).  The price was a little high, even with a discount for attending a wedding, but the location at the bottom west corner of Central Park, with Lincoln Center right there and P.J. Clarke's attached can't be beat.  Be prepared to spend $30/day parking (valet is so easy and didn't cost more than parking garages) and about $50/day in taxes on;4
Walked everywhere restaurants, MSG, shopping and times square! Was a perfect place for a quick weekend getaway!! Wonderful views from our rooms.  Friendly service and smiling faces! Highly recommend!!!;4
"This was a good hotel experience. My daughter wanted to stay here because it is associated with some TV show ;-) Really my only complaint is about the Wifi - should be free for guests. Instead we were charged by device. Temp adjustment in room also a little tricky. Check in staff, Jose, was very helpful and positive. Good job overall!";4
Tiny rooms, but this to be expected in the city. Always very busy in the lobby and had to wait to speak with front desk multiple times. $2 per checked luggage after checkout. Close to the metro and very central location.;4
The location of the hotel is very convenient.  We enjoy walking so this was a great location for all the places we went to see.    The initial room we were given was NY small - while it did have two double beds - it was extremely claustrophobic for two adults and two teenagers.  The hotel was fully booked but they were able to find another hotel room that had a bit more square footage which allowed us to move around and not be on top of each other.  The rooms are fine - it is an older hotel so take that into consideration if you are expecting contemporary.  The beds are comfortable and have nice linens.    Personally I prefer glass over plastic cups in the room.  If you call housekeeping you can get a Keurig coffee maker in your room but you have to call them.    The concierge;4
Airport hotels can often be bland but this is modern, stylish and welcoming. Nice rooms very clean and well appointed. Service though is exemplary and still what hospitality should be. The guest comes first. The room service menu has a confusion on items only available at weekends but realizing that's what I wanted they made sure I got it. Exemplary when so many others these days would say tough. Well done Hyatt look forward to staying here again.;4
Accommodating staff, close to subway, next to central park. Cons: small rooms, expensive (but it is NY city), old but well kept. Overall good. Location is reasonable, subway can take you anywhere, of course taxi service is available.;4
"Stayed 6 nights in August.  The location is great with Central Park across the road, Time Square, theatre district and shopping and good dining all within walking distance.  The rooftop bar is good and the pool deck is very nice although difficult and out of the way to get to it. The lobby bar has a great atmosphere and good for a pre dinner drink or a ""Chuck Bass"" night cap for those fellow Gossip Girl fans.  Rooms were small but clean and it is New York.  Air conditioner was very noisy but thankfully we were tired from long days exploring.  Would stay there again.";4
Free shuttle from airport and very close by makes this the perfect hotel to stay for transit. Check-in staff was lovely and service very quick  Clean, modern decor. Annoying having no bathrobes on the room and I don't know if any are available. Club floor provided good breakfast, however if you turn up after 8pm then you would have missed the food and alcohol availability. There are soft drinks and some bits to pick on. Staff member wasn't the friendliest. However the other staff member was different and he was very warm and welcoming. Wish he was there the night before!;4
Recently stayed here on a five night trip with my husband as a birthday treat. Thanks to Jose for upgrading us to a suite with amazing views.  Great location for exploring NYC and thatâs exactly what we done. I would recommend this hotel as nothing was too much bother.;4
Our room was recently refurbished so was chic, modern and lush! Two huge double beds with a lovely bathroom and air con. Great location, lovely staff. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend.;4
We stayed here for 2 nights - the hotel was clean and the beds were very comfortable. We didn't have a view but there was no city noise even though we were on the 7th floor. We had a great nights sleep! Within walking distance to everything but if you want to take the subway it's right there. The staff was very nice - nothing to complain about except the $22 a night fee.;4
We enjoyed our stay here after a long flight from Rome. Check in was fast and super friendly although they were very busy. The lovely woman at the front desk  was wonderful and had great recommendations. The rooms were clean and a nice size. The location was very convenient and check out was a breeze.;4
Like a LIGHTHOUSE in the sky, with the EMPIRE and THE CHRYSLER BUILDING, the New Yorker, today changed to the WINDHAM NEW YORKER HOTEL is a very excelent option to be in NEW YORK. Not cheap, because the price of the HOTELS in NYC are veryyy expensive but...HUGE and NICE!!!;4
Stayed at the New Yorker for 2 nights on quick visit trip to see 2 shows and give my daughter a taste of new York. We arrived at Penn station and left by Penn station, so having that right next door was perfect. The hotel is beautiful, and the room was perfect for us. It was very convenient to have the tick tock cafe right there for breakfast in the mornings. It is in walking g distance to times square, and easy access to metro. Pricey but it is new york!;4
This hotel was very convenient - good shuttle bus service to and from airport, handy (if somewhat overpriced) cafe/store downstairs, good gym. My daughter loved watching the planes taking off and arriving. The room was clean and comfortable.  Only criticism was that the hotel was just a little bland, the kind of hotel that feels like every other hotel. Also, some of the staff were really friendly and helpful, others not so much.;4
I had one night layover and wanted to be nearby the airport. There was a free shuttle service with extremely helpful drivers! The room was modern with necessary amenities and staff was pleasant. I would stay again under the same circumstances.;4
We had a group of 8 that I booked for a great rate of $180 per room per night. the check in staff were great, and made sure all our rooms were close to each other. The rooms - all large, clean, and beautiful beds that we all agreed we had a great sleep on. We dined in the hotel a couple of times...lovely hospitality, great food. We all relaxed around the pool, which is in a lovely setting with lots of green lawn and plenty of trees and cabanas. We chose this hotel based on the fact we wanted to revisit Universal Studios. 5 minute walk, and you're there! This is a perfect spot for families, as its relatively peaceful, despite the fact that the excitement of Universal is a heartbeat away. I can't stress what incredible value this hotel was.;4
This is definitely the place to stay at Universal City...  as opposed to the Sheraton.  We arrived late and left early, so I didn't really see much of the hotel.  There is a $17 self-parking charge for the garage, as with many places.  A couple of snafus during my stay:  The remote control for the TV didn't work...  maybe the batteries were dead?  Normally this would be a big deal, but it was late and I was tired, so I just read e-mail and went to bed.  Then during the night, staff slid a hotel receipt with no numbers under my door...  then replaced it with a receipt with no letterhead.  Turns out the night staff had printed out the receipts before doing the audit (according to the beleaguered morning clerk) and so we had to go to the desk to check out in the morning.  Frankly,;4
Returned to the Jane two years after my first visit. (In reference to other recent reviews, I saw no sign of any bugs in 4 days.)   The Jane's rooms are small. The A/C was somewhat noisy but workable. My in-room phone seemed uncooperative. The shared bathrooms/showers are impeccable.  The restaurant on the ground floor (not open during my last visit) has a great granola/fruit/yoghurt breakfast. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is quiet and relaxed. (I never heard any noise from the downstairs club in my room.)  A decent (10-minute) hike to the 14thSt/8th Av. subway.  There is no reason to spend any time in the Jane, but if a room is all you need during a NY visit, the location and the price make it attractive.;4
This is a great location if you are visiting the Lincoln Centre or if you wish to be near Central Park. The decor was nice, a bit of wear, but nothing off-putting. The bathroom fixtures are modern and the shower is large.The room was small but not the smallest I've seen in NYC. I enjoyed the restaurant, Ed's Chowder House, particularly the Prix Fixe menu. There was some sort of reality show being filmed in the lobby bar so I sat in the comfy mezzanine area and watched from above. There are cams on Lincoln Centre and Columbus Circle and you can view them on the tv in your room around the clock. I will choose this location again, probably in the summer so I can take advantage of the roof top pool. My recommendations to management are robes for guests since business travellers pack;4
Stayed in the hotel over Christmas, the staff were very good very quick to help. The room was small but I understand that is the norm for New York. The hole place is a bit on the dark side I think that they go a bit far with the mood lighting. Wifi is a bit if a issue there is free wifi in the lobby or you have to pay for it. But if you are lucky your room will be close to the Lincoln Center and you can pick up there free wifi. The mini bar is well stocked but it is not cheap and there is a shop just out side the hotel so there is no real need to use any thing from the mini bar. There is no tea or coffee in the room but again there is a Starbucks just out side the hotel (and on ever street corner or seems like it). There is a hair dryer and a umbrella in the room. In all it was;4
Great location, nice lobby, very nice rooftop views.  Safe and clean.  In an upscale area with great entertainment and eateries.  Comparable hotels in the area have heavy price tage, so nice price for the area.  Recommended ,;4
I have been a Guest at the New Yorker since 1958, ( H.S. Senior Class Trip ) .  I have stayed at this Hotel many times since, all under different Companies.  The Wyndham is by far the BEST!  I could find nothing to fault them with, well, perhaps a larger shelf for the toiletries.  Front Desk staff has always been very friendly and courteous.  An iconic Hotel that deserves your stay.  You won't be disappointed!;4
I stayed here with my daughter the beginning of February. Great welcome on arrival and we were also upgraded for free, for no reason at all which was a nice touch. I loved this place, itâs really nostalgic and reminded me of the king Kong film( we also had a view of the Empire State out of the window). The location too is amazing. Penn station is right outside, so is Maddison Square Garden, a short walk to the Empire State and Times Square. I also walked over to Central Park from there. Highly recommended.;4
The location of this hotel is perfect is you like to walk. Itâs about twenty blocks from Times Square. Thereâs very easy access to the subway around the block which makes getting around very easy. If you like Starbucks thereâs one at the corner when you walk out the door. An added benefit is Walgreens around the corner which makes picking up forgotten items easy.;4
Family of 4, kids are university age. We loved the location, we walked everywhere except took subway to 9/11 site as well as to Yankee Stadium. Easy walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, Empire State Building, Central Park, Moma, The Met, and MSG. Hotel staff were very friendly and managed to get us 2 rooms on same floor. Rooms very clean, beds comfy. Wifi not great, but can't have everything perfect. For the price, I highly recommend.;4
With so many options of where to stay in New York I would not hesitate to recommend The New Yorker hotel. First I will get the negatives out of the way (& there are not many) - *When we first arrived our room was not ready (fair enough it was before check in time) however to leave all our bags in storage  we were charged $5 per piece of luggage. When travelling from Australia with a family of five that is A LOT of luggage to be checked. I have never before been charged for this for this service and found it a little distasteful.  * Second negative was out on our balcony (YES! we had a balcony, but i will get to that) was a bag of left over food from the previous guests that wasn't cleaned up. We had to step over fries, wrappers, and half eaten burgers :(. Now for the positives;4
I stayed at this hotel for two nights for business, it's very nicely appointed and centrally located to Hollywood for events. Good on site is good, and there's a Peet's coffee for quick breakfasts which I appreciated. The corner rooms are spacious and the higher floors have great views. The thing to be aware of: this is a vey high traffic hotel. Families and tourists visiting Universal Studios are abundant, so there are lots of people, all over, all the time. A little patience (for the business traveler) goes a long way.;4
We stayed in the 29th floor which has excellent views! The hotel is as classy as a NY hotel can get, not too modern but very stylish. The floors, the elevator, the reception is just as classy as you can imagine a NY hotel. It could be more modern, but the style just outwins the modern style. Despite the rumours, the rooms are clean. Tiny, but clean!;4
Good quality rooms with all facilities needed. Can walk to some shops and restaurants nearby. Public transport by bus, as well as underground train line close by (didn't use this time, but have in the past). Bar was not open this time, but normally is.;4
From the moment you walk in it feels really spacial. Booked a quad room. very large wet room style shower. Only downside is new york traffic seem to think hitting there horns will help some how. Seem to die down after 10. And one night people next to us came back about 1.30 and decided to laugh and chat for an hour, stereo typical loud american. But it was a only one night. The two niggle above are ref being in New york the hotel was brilliant great location. Train ride straight from Airport (Airport train then local train) I think it was about $15 ea and about 40 min. Train stops at Madison Garden which is 3 min walk across the road. Across the road a diner caller roaster, did toast coffee and bacon sandwich. Nice easy breakfast. Used the metro card to get around $2,75 each;4
The New Yorker is located closed to Macys and is convenient to the subway. This is a clean hotel, beds are comfortable. Staff is friendly  and I feel safe when traveling here. It has alot of history. Keep in mind that it is an older hotel and the bathrooms are very small.;4
Our first time staying at the Empire in NYC! We had a nice room, clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. And we were very appreciative for the free Wi-Fi. Had a lot of trouble with the heater though - difficult to adjust and the radiator clanged all night when it came on, which was really annoying.;4
First time I've stayed since the hotel was renovated.  Great experience at check in.  The room was reasonably large, with plenty of space to store things and work at my laptop.  The bathroom was small, but suited my needs.  The Regency Club is on the third floor - excellent service and atmosphere.  I really liked the exercise room up on the top floor - you can face the airport and watch the planes come and go.  At LAX, that's always interesting.  Checkout very friendly and prompt.  The reason for four stars instead of five is the parking.  Traffic in the afternoons in terrible trying to enter the hotel driveway.  The are no signs for self parking.  I pulled into the entryway, and hotel staff walked by talking to others and ignored me.  I finally pulled out and drove around the;4
We booked this hotel last minute not really sure what we will get for the price. We were actually pleasantly surprised. We walked into the lobby and it was modern and clean. The hotel decided to upgrade us as we had booked the hotel thru a hotel app and did not have the option to choose a room type. We were pleasantly surprised again at how spacious the room was, for a New York City hotel. It was nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable. It had plenty of pillows. The bathroom was modern and clean and had a nice big shower with great water pressure. We will definitely stay here again.;4
After booking this hotel, I came on to TripAdvisor and read all of the horrendous reviews and was extremely worried about our stay.  We had decided to book a cheaper hotel so that we could spend our money on great restaurants and clubs and were worried that we had made a huge mistake.  However, once we got to the hotel we were beyond pleasantly surprised.  I had called the day before to ensure that we had a non-smoking room, and they upgraded s to a king bed for the same price.  The room was HUGE - anyone on here complaining about the room size has either never stayed in a NYC hotel or apartment.  The room was about the size of two of my bedrooms when I lived in NYC.  It was clean and the bed was really comfortable.  The air conditioning worked extremely well and was quiet, and;4
Staying in New York can be very expensive, but this hotel is not. The rooms are cosy, yes. But its great. It is made like a ship, the Reception, the hallway and the rooms. So awesome. I really loved staying here. The bathrooms are shared on the hallway but very very clean, the rooms get cleaned daily. The only thing which was a bit annoying was that you could hear housekeeping knocking at the doors in the hallway from 9 a.m. They want disturb you when you have the Do not disturb sign out but cause they yell quite loud you wake up. The bed is very comfortable and the heater did a great good job. Really good location and hotel. Would stay here again.;4
Great hotel close to Universal Studios and City Walk.  Clean and comfortable with great views over the valley.  Service with a smile and a shuttle for easy access to Universal Citywalk which has a range of restaurants.;4
"The hotel is well appointed, rooms are very clean and comfortable, and it offers lots of amenities for visitors.  Its location is right across from Universal Studios, so if you are planning on visiting there, this hotel is very convenient.  The hotel offers a convenient shuttle to and from Universal Studios and City walk.  Parking indoors was good but more often than not, the room key to access the parking facility would not work.  Just take a ticket and continue on; it is added to your bill anyway. We had dinner the first night in Cafe Sierra and it was ok, nothing special.  We decided to try the Lounge bar another night and it was better(same kitchen, I presume, but better???).  We also tried the Sunday Jazz/Champagne brunch which was very good; lots of choices, sparkling wine";4
Hi there ! Just got back from NYC a few hours ago, I've spent 7 nights in this upper west side Inn   I was a little worried about it when I saw other comments about the place. Also, they never answer emails don't even bother and on the phone they are preatty rude.   For a group of four girls, we too, the ground-floor deluxe suite. It was really not expenses, 50 buck per person and per night, what would you excpect for that price ?   Well, we had a small appartment, very well located, and cleaned every day. You enter a corridor and there is a huge bedroom on the left .On the right a nice bathroom. Then you enter a room that is supposed to be a small living room with a sofa bed for two and a small kitchen. The kitchen is really appreciated for breakfast cooking, coffee, et.... A;4
Small room, but you afe in new york, and this is the silent room Ive ever taken in town. The lounge is a good place to stay over. It is a little pricy, but on the corner of lincoln center and convenient for everything.i would stay again. There is a restaurant on the top. But i didnot havetime to check it out;4
We stayed here three nights in order to be close to UCLA (which it really wasn't - poor research on my part) and Universal Studios (right next door).  Since my husband is a Platinum Hilton Honors member, we were upgraded to a wonderful Executive Suite.  Thank you Hilton!!  The huge living room, huge bedroom and two part bathroom (separate sink and toilet/bathtub areas) made for a wonderful stay.  Plus, the breakfast vouchers (for either a plate of continential breakfast or a discount on the full buffet) plus drink and snack coupons (plus their complementary happy hour food available to everyone) kept us full and saved us money.  Some parts of the hotel are a bit dated (decor) but it in no way interferred with our stay.;4
I stayed here a few summers back on a weekend. I live in NJ and every once in awhile just feel like staying in the city. I might be going back soon, that's what made me think of it. The hotel has a really good location in the West Village in walking distance to a lot of nightlife (at night) and museums (for the day). The single rooms are tiny though. I mean very tiny. There is a shared bathroom. I went by myself and it was fine for what I needed. The price was pretty good considering the location. From what I remember it seemed clean enough. It had a nightclub or a bar on the premises if I remember correctly. Also the hotel has a neat, historic look to it in my opinion. So if you are the type that needs lots of space then no I wouldn't recommend it because the single rooms are;4
My experience was pretty good. A very well located hotel in front of Lincoln Center, very clean, good and reasonable prices. The only thing was the bad attitude of one waiter on the bar in the rooftop. The saloon for events itâs pretty good.;4
The hotel is so far from the main city but it is up on the hills of Los Angelo's , very close to universal studios . The room was marvelous but I hope to get Bette view next time , the problem was in elevator we had to wait for more than 5 min to call for it because there was a problem there , they have charged parking . Only 8 min walking to universals . Shilly bus to transfer you but you didn't need;4
Overall I would like to rate Hilton at Universal City 4+.  Location is great. We did not use the shuttle bus during our stay and enjoyed walking to Universal Studio, which took around 7 minutes. Also the hotel is quite near the center of Hollywood, just one stop by taking the Metro red line. What can you expect more?   We booked a corner room with a king size bed. Room is spacious and well maintained. Though TV is small and remote is too complicated to use, other equipment and facilities are at standard 4 star levels. I would particularly mention the safe because it is big enough that we can easily put everything important into it including a 15â laptop. Breakfast buffet provides various choices including Chinese dim sum. But if you stay in the hotel for longer period, you may;4
I completely agree with Tessa C (20 Sept) in every comment, (except the one about the renovations, I did not have that problem). The Breakfast was great- we didn't need to eat lunch! They had a great variety, and it was all so tasty.  Service was quite good, we also got to check in early. Although we were pushed to purchase tour tickets through the desk, which we did not take.  Rooms and housekeeping were great. We were under the impression we would be closer to Hollywood than the hotel actually is, however it was well connected as far as public transport goes. We could catch one bus, just out the front, all the way to Santa Monica beach, or catch the redline into the city and Hollywood. I would recommend this hotel to tourists.;4
I am giving this hotel a very good rating because of the room size but don't stop reading.  I like many other people read all the reviews of many hotels before booking this hotel. We were going to New York to celebrate a birthday and we didn't want to spend all of our money on a room that we were only going to sleep and shower in. We searched all the discount price sites and found several locations that were priced much higher than this hotel but had worse reviews. All the hotels in NY seem to have small rooms. This hotel is the same. The rooms are small but we were in our rooms less than 8hrs a day. That includes sleeping. BTW, the room may be small but the bed was comfortable.     We always had friendly staff greet us. We always had someone checking your room key to make sure;4
Hotel is in a great location, minutes walk from Times Square. Some staff at reception could be a bit more cheery. Beds were really comfy. Rooms were clean, great shower. Just ask reception if need towels or shower gels. On first night cistern in toilet kept making a noise. Reported to reception, resolved quickly. There was a bar in reception but never saw it opened. There was one doarman who was really helpful (didnât get his name)   he booked our taxi for going home and told us how much to pay, on leaving a doorman who we had never spoke to helped put bags in taxi, actually said when in taxi what about tip. We did give a tip but I feel you have to earn a tip. We did have the money ready for the person who did book our taxi and who had been helpful. I hope they do share tips.;4
Stayed at the New Yorker in March just as Carona Virus was about to hit, possibly not the best time to visit New York but didn't queue to visit anything which was great. The New Yorker Hotel was very clean and the location couldn't have been better, just up the way from the Empire State Building and central for all the sites we wanted to visit. We were on the 34th floor of the Hotel. The room was very clean but also small but ideal  for a long weekend which we were doing for my wifes Birthday with Friends. The staff were all friendly and gave us the best routes to take. We had planned to walk to the Statue of Liberty which we did the first full day(about 6 miles each way) walking along the Hudson River to keep away from crouds and took in the sights along the way. Second full;4
We had two double rooms on the fifth floor. The rooms were fairly modern, not immaculate, but quite adequate. Best positive is the location, it's amazingly well placed for central park, Lincoln centre, and the underground at the Lincoln. Columbus circle is only 300 yards and from there a quick walk in any direction takes you to places you'll want to see. Yuri, the concierge is excellent. A couple of downsides, water ran cold once and first two nights hotel was very noisy with younger guests. Minibar is super expensive, and our kids did not realise that the things in the room were not complimentary. I didn't realise the travel plug wasn't, once the label is peeled off, that's it. So ended up with a bill I wasn't expecting, more my fault than theirs. Ask about their hotel car to;4
Stayed at the New Yorker in February for a 4 night break to New York.  Room was quite small but was offered an upgrade on arrival, but felt as we would only spend time in the room to sleep it was not worth the extra money!  We were very surprised how close the hotel was to everything, having Madison Square Garden directly opposite and Empire State a few blocks along the road.  We ate every morning in the Tick Tock diner which is attached to the hotel.  It was lovely and a good choice of food was available.  We had breakfast and then didn't need to stop for lunch which gave us more time to see more highlights.  As our flight was not due until 9pm we had no choice but to pay the $5 for each suitcase to be looked after so we could go out for the day.  We thought this was a bit;4
This is a great base for exploring LA.  We got an annual pass for Universal Studios (8 minute walk), so we could pop in & out - you also get discount on the City Walk restaurants and in the Universal shops.  Hollywood Boulevard & Warner Studios only a short cab ride.  Breakfast buffet expensive, but a coffee shop in the hotel had croissant etc.  Staff friendly & helpful.  The pool's not great - but fine for the kids to let off some steam.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel.;4
This hotel has a unique history and divine interior.  The rooms are small but have plenty of places to hang or stow things.  I travel light, so this room was perfect for my trip style.  The hotel provides slippers and a robe for the shared showers and I didn't have to wait in line to use them.  Make sure you listen to instructions for the air conditioner, people have posted complaints, but it's not that hard, they tell you at check in.  The downstairs barman was delightful. He made us his version of a cosmo and it was perfect for the summer heat!  The only disappointment I had was the rooftop bar was closed for a private event.  There was nothing posted or sent to me about this and it was an additional reason to book here.  We were allowed to peek around the corner.  I hope;4
all was good, liked the blue lighting under the bed for a night light...would like something for breakfast with out going out;4
A strange hotel, but I'd still recommend it as part of a deal. The location is excellent - close to public transport, and a few things to look / eat at around even though the area isn't too pricey. While I was given a room for disabled users by luck, it was very very big. On the other hand, the cleanliness of the toilets and the bath area was borderline good - some marks were left on the towels, and a bit of mould on the shower (not bath). The staff at reception were just about civil - saying anything to them (including checking in) made me feel like I was disturbing them. Although they didn't have a problem with my leaving my luggage in their office 3 hours before check-in time. Fairly decent choice of food at breakfast, which was served until quite late in the morning. There;4
This was a beautiful hotel and a great location walking distance to just about everything. Our room was fairly large and comfortable for four people nice amenities. The beds are not the most comfortable but not horrible either.;4
Excellent location! Worthy price, delicious breakfast and good service. We were very pleased with the restaurant service (Mexican people willing to help, always smiling, great at service) the room were just what we need, small, tidy, clean and quite.;4
3 generations of ladies in my family came recently. We absoloutly loved it. The room we stayed in was large - 2 double beds - lots of storage - 2 closets & lots of drawer space. Wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised! Bathroom was small but very clean.  Hairdryer in room & safe too. When you go to New York you are barely in your room as there is so much to do - but after long busy days it was a welcome relief to get into a very comfy bed. I would def stay here again! And I will!! Thank you to all staff who were all helpful & polite. We used both restaurants  - tick tock was a really lovely place to have breakfast & the staff there were all wonderful ( the chatting from the waiters was welcomed from us & only thing that we didn't like was one of the waiters kept;4
Very nicely decorated iconic hotel with a great location and fab bar. Rooms are a bit small but comfy and well equipped. I got a good rate and was pleased overall with the experience but I find the hotel's habit of charging for little things like internet and use of the in-room coffee maker was a bit odd. I have seen this in other high end hotels and I don't understand it. I've travelled all over the world and almost every where I go, free wifi is bust part of the deal. Except in American high end hotels. I don't like it.;4
Overall, an excellent price to value ratio...GREAT breakfast (except for weak coffee) included in hotel fees but balance that with some steep parking fees(though that's all relative in LA). Clean comfortable rooms, good free internet, good fitness room, very friendly staff, and good location for central access to many areas.;4
beautiful lobby, rooftop bar was extremely loud and not so enjoyable. Breakfast served in the same area was very nice. Hotel rooms were dated and could use some updating. NO coffee makers or ice buckets in  the rooms.Location to the Lincoln Center and restaurants were a great benefit. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Would stay here again for sure.;4
Hotel is in a great central location. You can readily walk to Penn Station and many many restaurants are local to this Hotel, a McDonalds and an Italian restaurant are opposite the hotel. Empire state building, Time Square are walking distant if you are an able bodied person. The staff are all great and polite especially Alfonsa who helped greatly. The room was really lovely and large. The bathroom was equally large and functional. The room faced 8th Avenue and so was noisy especially for the city that does not sleep. The windows could have done with a clean otherwise the views were great.There are 20 floors some rooms are newer and most likely better than other small rooms that you are only comfortable for sleeping in. Room 850 was a great sized room compared to the first room;4
We stayed here overnight at 2 different occasions, each time we booked 3 rooms for 6 of us. Very clean hotel near to the airport. We booked this hotel to store our luggage so we could travel light to Las Vegas, and later returned the rental car then hop on the shuttle to catch our early flight to Jakarta. We will consider to come back and stay at this hotel again next time weâre in the area.;4
Excellent location near Penn Station.  The room was very comfortable, so are the beds.  It is an Art deco building if I am not wrong.  The room and bathroom still have an old charm.  The view from the room was stunning at the 31st floor.  Would come back and recommend.;4
This is when a hotel shows it TRUE self, if they can handle all the tired frustrated travelers during a huge snow storm-they can handle anything...I was one of those people. The lines were long to check in but everyone who manned the front desk was nice and also patient. The rooms were a nice size and had A big shower. The location was great across from Lincoln Center- just wish I had time to go out- the city was closed. But I got a gret view from the window! Nice places to eat all around the hotel-the seafood place was great. Will go back --when it gets a little warmer.;4
Have stayed here before. Great hotel central for all amienities. Our room this time was not so modern but it was immaculate and kept that way throughout. Our only critisism was no fridge which we had previously. We had a view of the Empire State Building this time which was great. Would recommend this hotel and would stay again if we are ever in NYC again.;4
The hotel and room sizes and shared bathrooms were exactly as promised. So It would be silly to comment on sizes. But the amenities, the cafe, the club downstairs, the service, the lobby are all more than I ever expected.;4
Small but cosy rooms, bathrooms are very clean, maybe take some ear plugs as you do get a bit of noise from the halls at nights with doors slamming etc.  Great location, heaps of nearby coffee shops and restaurants and not far to walk to the subway.;4
Our stay at The New Yorker could not have been better. Our premium suite on the 38th floor afforded panoramic views of the city while providing all the comforts one could want. We will definitely be back to The New Yorker!;4
Hotel is really nice and walking distance Universal Studios and the city walk.  Great place to hold a conference.  I attended a large conference and there were plenty of rooms for break out sessions and large group meetings.;4
Location excellent for subway especially if you work out which access to use. Also easy walk to times square or amtrak. Rooms are nice . We were lucky to be given a larger one. Staff helpful. Unfortunately I think the double bed was smaller than average.;4
We stay there for 4 Days. Hugo from the restaurant did a great job. Staff was very helpful. Rooms are great. Only 5 minutes to metro an 15 minutes to Universal City. The perfect place if you would visit hollywood. Thanks;4
Our family of four stayed at this hotel over Spring break 2013 after reviewing the opinions of others on this website. The reviews were mixed so I was a bit nervous. I would say that it is not the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at - the room was a bit small and could use a little TLC, but not  bad. I actually thought the common areas were very nice. The breakfasts were great. The best thing though was the nice gentleman in the small gift shop who let me take a map and pay later, as I did not realize it was cash only and was on my way out. And when I found him later to pay, he gave me a little candy just for bringing the money I owed. We did not use the pool area because it isn't heated and it wasn't hot enough out. The location was ideally suited for us because we were in town;4
Good location near buses and the underground train that goes to Hollywood casino itself and connect s to other lines. The check-in staff were very helpful letting us check in early. We had a problem operating a few lights in our bedroom and maintenance were quick to arrive. The cook at breakfast is very fast and good at preparing different egg combinations. The variety for breakfast is very good but you get what you pay for. They also have local comedians use a room once a week that guests are encouraged  to be the audience for. Good value for money for a 3.5 class hotel.;4
This hotel is located perfectly between Hollywood and Downtown LA. The hotel is clean, spacious, comfortable, and offers a great breakfast. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for location and quality for money.;4
This hotel is an old Mariners lodgings, and apparently some of the Titanic survivors were brought here. That was enough to get us to book! The hotel is very cool, with a bar and club, with adjoining restaurant on the ground floor, and a rooftop bar (not to be missed on hot days)! We had a captains cabin which was beautiful, with well appointed bathroom. The staff were helpful, and the location is excellent, right in the heart of the Meatpacking District, and very close to the Highline and the Whitney. An excellent spot!;4
Pros: This is a clean modern hotel that is very close to LAX. We walked from our arrival flight to the hotel with luggage and it took us about 10 mins. Our room was bigger than average and the fit out was clean and had a new'ish feel. The bathroom and shower were excellent and clean. TV was a large flat panel and they had 60 odd cable channels. Windows facing one of the runways was double glazed.  Cons: none I would stay again when next needing a stopover at LAX.  Tip: if you have some time to kill take a cab/uber to Manhattan Beach for a few hours especially for a meal. Uber was $8US one way;4
As a new yorker this is one of my favorite hotels to stay at for a mini-staycation. Stayed here with my boyfriend twice already and have no major complaints.  Pros: Location: Right by Lincoln Center and across the street from awesome restaurants. Eat at Cafe Fiorello if you get a chance. The hotel will help you make a reservation there and if it's on the weekend make sure you make the reservations early! There's also a Duane Reade on the same block for ANYTHING else you may need.  Bars: There's a bar in the lobby which is awesome and the area around is very lounge like. There is also a rooftop lounge/club which hotel guests get to have access to without standing on line outside. Line usually gets ridiculous on a Friday and Saturday night. Staff: All the staff at the hotel is;4
I have stayed 3 nights in this small hotel in March 2015. It was very clean and the look was very modern. The staff at the front desk was extremely kind and were always willing to help (even putting our wine bottles in their fridge during the day). The room was small but cozy.   The best about this hotel is the location. 5-10 minutes from Time Square and Madison Square Garden. You can basically walk to everything in Manhattan from there. I would stay there again anytime: definitely a great price for what we had.  Plus side: There is a little liquor store in the building. Downside: It is manhattan afterall, there is noise coming from the streets and you are right on 30th avenue.;4
I visited LA on a solo trip and this was my second trip after 2008. I was scared to visit LA alone due to the stories I had heard which happen after we cross the 5th Street. Hence, I was very careful in selecting the place I will be staying in. I went through a lot of reviews and made up my mind to book this hotel. Upon arrival I took an uber and got dropped to the hotel. My experience from the airport to the hotel was great as the uber driver was very nice to help me with my two big sized bags and carefully dropped me to the right place. On reaching to the hotel, I was greeted with the big smile and the staff at the front desk was very professional. They had all the details of my booking and I was checked-in in less than 5 minutes without any waiting. I was helped till my room;4
Perfect if Universal Studios is your main priority for staying.  Ten minute reasonably strenuous walk to Universal, or the shuttle runs approximately every 15 minutes.  Very helpful concierge staff.  I was very happy with the standard of the room and the cleanliness.  The buffet breakfast is really lovely, and a great way to build yourself up for a full day doing the tourist things.  Freshly squeezed orange juice was delicious.  Great wait staff.  Room service menu was good, especially when catering for children and service was prompt.  I also very much appreciated the range of goods offered in the convenience/gift store in the foyer for last minute items as you are not very close to other shops.  Reception desk staff could have been a little more welcoming, and HHonours points;4
It was our first trip to NY so we were nervous about the hotel. The Empire Hotel did not disappoint. The rooms were small but very clean and the decor was modern. The only complaints I have about the room was the lack of storage to put your things in and it was very dark even with all the lights on.  The hotel is located in the perfect part of town for a first timer. It's right next to central park and it's just a short walk away from Times Square and all the other tourist attractions such as the Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall.  The elevators are painfully slow. I heard some people say they waited 10-15min for elevators to arrive to their floors.   The rooftop patio during the day is beautiful but be warned: the pool is more like a bathtub filled with children. At;4
This hotel was a rare gem in a neighborhood where there were not many good hotels in the 1960s and 70s...When I stayed there in the 1980s I remember it as having seen better days- but a recent stay was a very pleasant one - lobby and rooms renovated and updated....Rooms are a bit small,and there can be noise on 9TH Avenue,but this hotel is now in a prime section of NYC- with Lincoln Center literally across the street......Hotel also offers 2 great restaurants (Including PJ Clarks) and Verdi Park as well caddy-corner...Central Park is a block away....Rooms can be expensive,but with advance notice there are value deals here...Hotel is clean and well maintained.;4
Needed a place to stay by Hollywood for a good price. The room was clean and had secure gated parking. The hotel was under renovation back in 2014. Do not know if it's the same case now. My floor looked like they were redoing the carpets. Happy overall with my room and parking. I would stay again.;4
I stayed here a couple of weeks ago, knowing that it was a dated hotel in a not-so-glamorous part of town.  Iâve stayed in many hotels in NYC, from the Ritz Carlton to Hampton Inn.  I found this hotel to be quite desirable for my needs.  First of all, it was close to Penn Station, and I always go to NYC from Baltimore by train.  Also, when I did use Uber, my rides were not that expensive.  My room was small, but Iâm alone and donât need a large room.  I have a lovely apt. in Baltimore to come home to, so this room was clean and the service was great.  Iâd high,y recommend this reasonably priced hotel.;4
This was our second stay at the New Yorker, again in a suite. For two adults and two teenagers, this is a great option. This suite was larger than the one we previously stayed in. It was on the 34th floor with amazing views over NYC and the Empire State Building. The suite (3420) has a large square hallway, with walk in wardrobe/cupboard, lounge, large bathroom and large bedroom with two double beds. My mother-in-law and father-in-law also stayed at the hotel, but their room, being a double, was much smaller.  The location is fabulous for seeing all the main attractions and staff were friendly and helpful, as usual.   A complimentary birthday cake was sent to our room for my sonsâ birthday during our stay, which was a nice touch.   Our visit coincided with the elections and;4
This hotel is across the road from Madison Square Garden and down the road from Macy's and about 15min walk to Times Square, the train station is right at the hotel's door step. We had a 1 bedroom room with a sofa bed in the lounge room and king bed in the bedroom a small sink and fridge in the lounge room. There was a staff member on the door checking room keys when you returned before you got into the lift area. There was a pizza place across the road which was delish if you want a quick easy dinner in the room. The Italian restaurant onsite was also amazing with filling huge dishes. We ate at the Tick Tock diner most mornings for breakfast until one day when the waiter changed the total on our bill to include the tip that he thought he was entitled to, when we didn't put in;4
I stayed at the Empire Hotel from 8/1-8/4/15. I had made my reservation thru a Groupon offer which directed me to booking.com. Consequently, my rate was below the rack rate.   The hotel is centrally located with very easy access to Lincoln Center, other Broadway theaters and Columbus Circle.   Hotel have been renovated and the rooms are comfortably sized and equipped. air conditioning was very efficient for the very hot and humid weather during my stay. I have stayed in other NYC hotels that were not nearly as comfortable for a much higher nightly cost.   Checkin and check out was efficient. Hotel staff was pleasant and helpful.   Only con would be that everything is everything is a la carte, from the keriug pods for in-room to simple laundry bag for dirty clothes (no plastic or;4
I like many other travellers rely on Tripadvisor for acurate reviews prior to booking accommodation and we were very happy with our stay the Hollywood Hotel for the price we payed.  Check in was very smooth and we had room 111, which was a ground floor opening onto the courtyard (though we never used it), exceptionaly clean and a comfy bed. i must say though that i would not like to have had a ground floor room at the front of the hotel, which was right next to the road and having a balcony that you would not be able to sit at or open, due to dust and traffic.  One of the main advantages to this hotel is the cost, with an exceptional breakfast and staff and the fact that the metro is literally across the road. We were able to travel downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood and Santa;4
It's a great location, in easy walking distance from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.  The hotel felt safe, which as a female solo traveler is one of the most important things I look for in a hotel.   The staff was great.  The rooms are small, but I didn't spend much time in it anyways.  The wifi was free.  As with all boutique hotels I'd recommend google street viewing it before you go as, like many boutique hotels, the sign and entrance isn't as obvious as corporate hotels.;4
A bit noisy location, next to the Broadway Av. Some construction were going on during our stay. But it is next to the Central park that makes it as a great location for my daily running activities. Overall it was a good stay!;4
We just returned from a week at the Empire Hotel. We found the staff to be exceedingly friendly and our room was great - with a lovely view of The Lincoln Centre. We had the cold buffet each morning and found it to be good value. Lots of great restaurants just outside the front door for evening. An easy 30 minute walk toTheatres and Time Square. We travel often in Europe and The Empire has the same feel as some of the comfortable hotels we stay at there. Don't expect a huge room or bath but both are comfortable, well appointed and clean.Elevators were a frustration but we had been warned about this problem - my suggestion is to get a room on one of the lower floors so you can use the stairs while they are under renovation. My personal thanks to the manager John S. for responding;4
The Empire Hotel has been a mainstay for me and my family for 50 years and it has never failed to be more than satisfactory. The location across from Lincoln Center and a block from Central Park makes it extremely convenient. The rooms are clean, generous in size, and the staff helpful. There is often quite a party scene at night that makes it festive in the lobby and on the rooftop, but the rooms are quiet and private.  The junior suite is an especially good value if you are a group of 3 or 4.;4
Stayed at the Ameritania hotel for ten nights in August 2018. This was our second stay (first time was four night during Christmas 2016). The hotel is located in a good area from which you can easily walk to many interesting places and excellent breakfast spots. Near all the theatres and Central Park. The rooms are a good size and our cleaned daily. The cleanliness was up to standard. Some wear and tear is to be seen but nothing major. There is some noise as there would be next to Times Square but we got used to it by the second night. The staff is so friendly and helpful and attended to all our needs and questions. We would especially like to thank the doorman Said who made us feel welcome with his friendly smile every time we went in and out of the hotel. I would definitely;4
Hotel was very well located, close to the metro red line which made getting around LA very easy and quick.  We stayed in the deluxe spa room which was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was good, omelettes made to order which is included in accommodation cost.  Our only problems were that a maid tried coming in to clean our room in the morning (9.00am) when we had the do not disturb sign up, and this wasn't appreciated, and we never saw the bar open.;4
This a solid 3 star hotel. Clean, good sized rooms with a nice bed and a good variety of pillows.  Nice, large bathroom.  Free wifi that works ok, not great.  Nice LCD TV, fridge and microwave in room. All in all, a good value for the price (under $100).  The quibbles: Chilly front desk woman greeted me upon arrival and never once cracked a smile. The hotel is located in a so-so section of N. Vermont, (try and get a rear room since Vermont is noisy) so you pay $18/day for secure parking. It's nice to also have a complimentary breakfast buffet served in a full sized dining room, however, the eggs are nasty (they look like yellow coasters) but cereal, juice and coffee hit the spot. Also, there's no in-room safe, a standard item in most 3* hotels.  I ultimately got a better price;4
First time visiting New York and took the only place available. Pleasantly surprised to find this really nice spot that was conveniently located close to the 96th Street subway stop, warm and cosy rooms that kept us housed for the 6 nights. Need to get their act together with those lifts which are very dodgy but otherwise a really nice place to stay, highly recommended.;4
I'm always pleased to stay at the Empire. The location is very convenient: few minutes by taxi from the Jacob Javits and easy to walk down Manhattan. The crew answered quickly to a note of mine about the shower. I'll get back!;4
Just back from a four night December stay at the New Yorker for my wifeâs 40th birthday and had a great time.   We arrived just after 2pm on a Sunday and they checked us in right away. We were put on the 36th floor with a great view along 34th street towards the edge and Hudson yards. Room was clean and came with a fridge and coffee machine. Room wasnât tiny as Iâve seen some people mention, plenty of room for our cases to sit alongside the wall or to store at the bottom of the walk in closet. Room also had a hairdryer, ironing board and iron.   Shower was great and the bed was very comfy. Walls are a bit thin so you can hear people moving about especially in the morning but probably to do with the age of the hotel. Nothing that disturbed my sleep at all.   Despite only being;4
Me and girlfriend stayed at Days Inn for 4 nights at the end of March and we were very happy with it.  The service wasn't overly smiley and jolly, but it was very efficient. The room was fairly spacious and very clean. Not much of a view (a brick wall), but we didn't go to NY to look out a window.   The daily cleanup was great - just one day they forgot to wash the coffee machine, but I survived that. After all - it was nice to stay at a budget hotel that didn't provide instant coffee on the room!  The room was fitted with a safe (which I couldn't get working, but I think I did something wrong).   The Internet room eats dollars quickly, but there are cheap internet cafÃ©s nearby.  The subway couldn't be nearer and it takes you straight to Penn Station on Downtown Manhattan.;4
Stayed one night while we were visiting Universal Studios.  A totally convenient hotel, walking distance, and plenty of parking (although parking is $28/night, ouch).  The hotel is completely modern, and the rooms have plenty of fancy amenities and USB for charging electronics.  The hostess and staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful.  The only complaint I would have is limited places to dine on site and the restaurant closed at 9pm on a Thursday night leaving us nothing to eat until the morning.  Construction is active right now at the hotel, adjacent to the lobby, although it was quiet at night it was a tad loud and messy downstairs.;4
"This was a 3 night stay for business at both Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and Mt. Sinai Hospital. I was a bit leary after reading some of the negative reviews but was attracted to the location and the lower cost than most NYC hotel. I had a very pleasant stay and was not disappointed at all. True - it is an older property, one set of elevators doesn't work, the other set is very slow and crowed, corridors are dark etc. But, these are minor issues and there are many positive aspects to the hotel. Upon check-in, I was ""upgraded"" to a premium room on the 11th floor. My impression is that that higher floor rooms are much better than lower floors. What they considered ""premium"" would likely be standard in other hotels, but was really quite nice - spacious, clean, and quiet with a";4
All the staff at the Empire Hotel were phenomenal when I was taken ill with a major heart attack whilst staying there.  I would especially like to single out Bernard from the security team who quickly summoned an ambulance crew and I was swiftly taken to hospital where I received a stent under an emergency procedure.  Without his swift response and actions I would not be writing this now!  He was also very helpful to us when I was discharged from the hospital back to the Empire Hotel.;4
"Stayed overnight for a layover.  Rooms are very nice, but you are stuck with the hotel restaurant and snack bar, which aren't very good and ridiculously priced.  24 hour shuttle every 15 minutes; very convenient. Next time, I'll stay somewhere with restaurants in walking distance.";4
"As a last minute decision, I stayed at this Hyatt Regency due to it's proximity to the airport-LAX! It's literally walking distance to Terminal 1....Vega$ Baby! LoL The entire hotel is nicely ungraded and the ""Double-Windows"", now block out any Airplane noise.... Awesome! Service Check-in was Nice & Rooms Super New, Clean & Quiet.  I truly appreciate the remodeling, since it was down well compared to Vegas. In Vegas, the rooms smelled like fresh paint & glue. Also the fit & finish was just off.... Give the Hyatt Regency Airport Location a try...You will be pleasantly Surprised! PS...Only 1 down-side.... Parking is $44.00 a DAY... OMG!!!!!! (Stay there, use UBER/Lyft).";4
Picked hotel due to proximity to Ed Sullivan theater.  Couldn't have been closer!  We had a great room, king deluxe, and we were quite happy with it.  Bed very comfortable.  Could not control the heat/cooling.  Price very reasonable.;4
The Empire's terrifically located - five minutes from Columbus Circle, five minutes from Central Park and about ten minutes from Fifth (and five minutes from the AMC IMAX cinema!). The staff and friendly and courteous and the hotel is nicely decorated. The room is fine if basic - wifi is expensive (it's $70 for a week, which applies for only one device, so you're probably putting a US SIM card in your phone if you need directions to sights in NY) and the bar and snacks in the room are heinously overpriced (but that's to be expected in a hotel). But the hotel itself is fantastic - in terms of location, staff and sleep quality. I couldn't really have asked for more.;4
A busy but great place to stay. Very friendly staff and great central location  Decor beyond the lobby is a little tired looking but don't be put off because my room at least, was fine. A very good stay all round but desperately need towel dryers in the bathroom.;4
We stayed here 13th- 18th December 2013 and had an amazing time! The only down point was the accommodation. The hotel is very basic, our room was very small, and there were noisy pipes and general hotel noise throughout the night that kept us up on a couple of occasions. However, having chosen this hotel because it was cheap, we knew the hotel would be basic and braced ourselves for a small and compromised room. As long as you bare this in mind, you'll be happy enough with the hotel. The hotel is out of the way of all the normal touristy bits in a residential area where NY workers live. You have to get a 15min tube in every morning to get to all the sights. It was a bit of a pain, however apart from on one occasion, we actually enjoyed this as we were on the train with all the;4
Helpful front desk staff.  Rooms were small but clean, w only basic furnishings and we had a nice view over the park.  Very welcome air conditioning.  Bathrooms were clean but tiles were chipped in places and it looked as though only patches had been recently re-painted on the ceiling?!  Lift was out of order on a couple of days but luckily we were on the first floor so not too far to walk.  No tea or coffee making facilities in the room which would have been nice.  Handy for the Subway on 110th or 103rd, about 20 mins to midtown and 30m to Battery Park.  Good value for what we paid in the height of summer holiday season.;4
Great stay. Great location. Very clean. Had to pay for tea and coffee in the room. Breakfast on the roof $15 for a Danish and a coffee. Bit pants when you've spent so much in the room. Great concierge. Close to Central Park and Broadway. Thin walls if people are having sex next door!;4
Having been recommended this place for cheap travel, I booked a room for 3 nights for less than Â£200, albeit with a shared bathroom. After reading the reviews about noise, I immediately emailed the hotel to ask for a quiet room. They replied quickly saying they would do their very best, but no promises.   Upon arriving I was greeted by a friendly doorman, and reception advised me they'd got me a room on the top floor. Indeed it was the furthest room possible, so I was pleased.   The rooms are tiny as per the reviews, but with hooks and under-bed drawers there's plenty of storage space. There's a tv, water, wifi, and gown and slippers, and you can even borrow iPads or laptops for free.   My room was pretty drafty so I nearly froze that night, but the next day I was given extra;4
The location of this hotel was very good and the view from the room was excellent. The hotel itself is a little old, with small rooms and no minibar in the room but overall it was a very enjoyable stay.;4
Empire hotel is definitely my favorite place to stay in NYC. The location is fabulous and the staff is very helpful! I love the decor and the rooms are great. I also love that there is a Starbucks right at on the corner. Can't wait to come back!;4
When we arrived at the hotel, they were polite and asked about our journey and offered to upgrade our room to a double. When I said I was in New York for a birthday holiday, we were again upgraded to a double room on the 31st floor with a view of the Empire State! Which was a pleasant surprise.  Like everyone else, the location was the one of the best things, as it's right around the corner from Penn station and Madison Square gardens. Making it easy to get there from JFK by getting the air train to Jamaica and then the subway. Easily walkable to places like Times Square, Empire State and the Chrysler building. Plus Macy's is around the corner.  The hotel lobby is beautiful and the whole hotel is very 'art deco'. The room was a decent size and was always clean. All staff were;4
We wanted a reasonable room at a reasonable price. This is what we got. The room was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. The Tv and all elctrics, air conditioner were all fine.The area is safe , is next door to a pharmacy, diner, laundrette and choice of reasonable restaurants and is less than 100 yds to a subway and right on bus routes. What more could a traveller want?  if you want luxurious, go to the Hilton and pay more! If you want to be in the madness of Times Square then pay more for it! Yes its a bit older, yes there are slow elevators ( there are stairs you know!) The staff are nice and helpful and there are there are the little touches like toothpaste/ extra toiletries in the bathroom. We heard a few people grumbling as they waited for the lifts , but;4
Our party of 4 stayed in the double, double room for four nights and it was perfect for our needs. Plenty shower gel etc and the room was clean and big enough to accommodate four large suitcases! The staff were very welcoming and friendly and even printed off our boarding passes for us. They left us a bottle of champagne in our room as I and another member of our party were celebrating our 50th & 30th birthdays!  Jeff deserves a special mention, he recommended places to eat and organised our return taxi for us. The Ameritania is ideally located for Broadway, Times Square and Central Park. If you get the chance... stay!;4
We stayed for 4 nights just before Christmas. We wanted something basic and nearby the main attractions of London. We were pleasantly surprised with Abercorn! The location was perfect: close enough to downtown to not spend long on the tube, but far enough away that we weren't spending an arm and a leg on the hostel.  We were really pleased with the cleanliness and warmth of the room, though it was a bit loud on the ground floor. The hostel allowed us to check in at 9 am, which was awesome as we'd just come off a red eye flight. The hostel is 2 minutes from the tub station and 3 minutes to a wide variety of shops, cafes and pubs. I was especially pleased with the amazingly hot, powerful shower in our ensuite.  I will definitely stay with Abercorn next time I am in London, and I;4
Family Vacation in LA was perfectly started with a stay in the Hilton, very close to Universal Studios, which the kids loved, very convenient for the Mrs and I, we attended the Pitbull Concert in Gibson Amphitheater.  If you have a car I would suggest valet, only 4$/day from self park.  Hotel starting to show it's age, still fresher than most in the area! location is very convenient specially that we went to Hollywood and Beverly Hills, for meals and walkabouts.   Pool was a beautiful break from the Studio's, however more sunbeds are needed.  Breakfast had a decent selection of food, replenished constantly although we always made it with 20minutes before closing!!   Concierge very helpful in making the reservations in the different restaurants and to recommend the best sites to;4
Arrived Monday April 11th to see David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Got to the hotel about 10:30. Very nice lobby. We had a quick check-in and a miracle - our room was ready! Official check-in is at 3pm. I expected to leave our luggage with the bell captain for the day. We went right to our room, #2633.  Security was near the elevators, checking everyone's room key. The room was small but was recently renovated, everything in good order.  The bed was comfortable, bathroom was small but everything was updated. The view out the window was of the next tower, but hey, it's NY!  Best thing - the room with all fees and taxes was $205.   Location is just across the street from Madison Square Garden and just a few more blocks to Macy's and the Empire State Building. MSG was very nice, my 1st;4
Very nice hotel and very clean.  Staff was very friendly.  But be prepared to pay a huge amount for food at the shop on the main level.  The valet service was excellent.  The design of the rooms was wonderful and had all the latest technology.;4
As others have said, rooms on the top three floors have been renovated and are very nice.  We had a room with two double beds and there was plenty of space for 3 adults.  This is not a luxury hotel, but the room we stayed in was significantly nicer than a typical Days Inn room.  Yes, other parts of the hotel are old and the elevators are slow...that's the downside.  We found the front desk very helpful and courteous.  Graciela and Coral were a pleasure to deal with.  Outstanding location.;4
We go every year to events at Lincoln Center events and stay at the Empire. It is SO convenient. Rooms are adequate and affordable. We don't stay in our rooms except to sleep. That's all we request is that our rooms are clean, quiet, and comfortable. No bells and whistles needed.  One of the staff, Galina, was helpful and very courteous.;4
"Great location, good quality.   But breakfast was cool 2 days out of 3. Its as if the pass lights were not used.   Also quite a bit of ""building"" noise early morning - more noticeable as we like to sleep with tht window open";4
I stayed at this hotel for a conference. The conference services were quite good in terms of food service. Their A/V people needed a bit more coffee at times to keep up. But the coffee was good so that shouldn't have been a problem. The lobby presents a vision of a grand, luxurious hotel. Then you get to the rooms. Ok, I get it, it's Manhattan, I don't expect a villa. But it took some adjusting to the small size. The bathroom in particular is tiny. But what redeems it all is the location, close to tons of stuff and sitting right on top of a subway station so you can get to anywhere else. Maybe not the best value for your money, but worth at least checking it out.;4
I booked this hotel due to its close proximity to Universal Studios and therefore expected to pay a premium. However, in comparison to other hotel chains my family has stayed in, this one was way behind on up-to-date amenities. The room was clean, but dated. The TV was quite old, and unlike in some hotels, you had no access to services such as NetFlix. The hotel didn't even have free Wifi - it's a must these days! Everything about the room was old-fashioned and it still had the same decor as when I visited 10 years earlier. The staff we encountered at Guest Services were unfailingly polite and accommodating. It also had a free courtesy shuttle to Universal Studio City which had a plethora of amenities. This also meant you weren't dependent on paying exorbitant prices for;4
Hotel is clean with fresh towels provided each morning, view from room was good ( on the 20th floor). Staff are friendly and helpful, including the room maids, security is good and not to intrusive or inconvenient. Great location, 10-15 minutes from Times Square on foot, Macey's slightly less. Penn subway 2 minutes, and Madison Square Garden across the street. The on- site diner, Tick Tock, serves good food at fairly reasonable prices and is convenient. The only negative point, could hear the taps and shower being used in the adjoining room either late at night or early next morning.;4
We stayed for family of 6. There is a ferry to the Universal studio which is convenient. It is a bit of a walk to and fro the metro and is on a slope. Sheraton is a bit nearer to metro. Not much of a great scenic view. Staff were mostly courteous but we encountered a female one  (Sandra)  that was rude. Alex at reception was great.  Good if you want to spend most of your time at the studios, if not look closer to twon.;4
We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. My family and I were staying there because we were attending the Teen Choice Awards held at the Universal Citywalk. Check In went smoothly and the view from the room on the 19th floor was great. The pool was great and service superb. We went to the Hollywood attractions from there and it was easy to get there using a back way from the hotel. Also, I waited in line (6 AM) for Tonight Show tickets with success for that evening. NBC is not far from the hotel. One memory of the hotel would have to be when 20 Lamborghini's pulled up to the front of the hotel to eat lunch. They had a Lamborghini club.;4
We took a trip to LA for a little getaway from the fall chill.  We experienced lovely weather and a good experience at the Hollywood Hotel.  We ultimately chose this place due to the great price.  The room was pretty basic but was clean and the bed was comfortable.  We liked the fact that the room had a mini fridge, good wifi, and a TV that connected to our Netflix account.  The room got a little chilly at night but luckily they had a space heater in the room.  We were on the 3rd floor and our room overlooked the courtyard.  It would have been nice if the balcony had chairs or furniture... but it didn't, which we thought that was kind of strange.  We went to the pool in the evening but it was way to chilly to get in.  Too bad it wasn't a heated pool and sadly there is no hot;4
Based on some of the reviews, I was a bit nervous about staying here.  My husband booked it as a surprise weekend in NYC.  We stayed in a junior suite - which is just a normal size hotel room in most places outside of NYC - considered spacious in NYC.  The king size bed was comfortable with good linens.  Staff was friendly -fast check-in.  The room was clean with a great view of Lincoln Center and Broadway.  Loved the rain shower.  The location there can't be beat, but that also brings more than average street noise even for NYC.  The hotel was also too hot for my likes.  The rooftop bar brings a nice touch.  I would stay here again but request a room in the back of the hotel it would be quieter.;4
The location and convenience are great, especially the complimentary shuttle to Universal City Walk. Great front desk staff and manager.   The only issue that my group of four had was when we went to eat at the restaurant/bar for dinner around 8pm, they seemed very understaffed. Only looked like there were two servers and we had to wait about 5-10 min just to be given menus and then another 5-10 min for waters. Once we ordered one entree for each of us, we had to ask for the complimentary bread three times before it was finally brought out. The quality of food was fine, but the excessive time it all took and the rudeness of one of the lady servers made it not the best experience.   The breakfast buffet was awesome though!;4
Rooms were very clean and tidy, good size with a huge shower recently updated I think. They were painting the hallways when we were there. There is a breakfast room downstairs (lift) offering everything you could want for Breckie Lovely competent chef who makes all the egg dishes you could want fresh. There is a gym and pool across from the car park. A big surprise was a little kiosk selling everything you could want or need. Good prices too, souvenirs as well, cheap tshirts. Night desk staff were great lots of information and help, better than the day ones. Very close to the metro and buses. Also a few shops for cheap easy meals. Probably about a 15 minute bus ride down to the main area of Hollywood. Very good value;4
It's always easy at this Hyatt if your flying in or out of LAX.  They have the best transportation of any hotel in LAX - I have tried them all.  I also like that I can walk over to the hotel.  After sitting on the jet from London to LA, walking from the INTL terminal is very enjoyable.  Not that LA has great air but it's nice to be outside.  Cairo is the Club Lounge manager, is one of the best.  Yes, I like the club floor at the Marriott better - my kids love watching jets but Cairo makes the Hyatt Club FUN.  If the Marriott were to hire him away, Huston We Have A Problem!  So, you want to make it easy, and enjoy a wonderful club, the Hyatt is your hotel.  I have spent 25 or more nights in this hotel over the past two years!;4
After we booked this hotel for six nights, I read the mostly negative reviews and almost cancelled our reservation.  We decided to give it a try anyway figuring if it was so bad, we could cancel the remainder and find another hotel.  I'm glad we did as we were pleasantly surprised!  I will address all the negative comments I read as compared to our experience.      We wanted a hotel centrally located between Culver City and Burbank (for movie studio tours) and this hotel met that need.  Yes it is not in the nicest area but we didn't think the area was terrible or dangerous.  If you like to walk to places from your hotel or walk to restaurants nearby, then you will probably not like this location.  However, It is only a few minutes drive from many of the major Hollywood sites and;4
We had no car and did not want to drive. Very close to main a subway line.  Safe to walk around at all times. If you like breakfast, it is from 6:30am - 10:30am and omelettes are cooked for you. Please tip Hugo. He worked every day I was there. Our room was noisy. Room 133. Right by front desk and entrance.  Stay on upper floors. Staff very average. Michael at front desk was the one exception. He was very helpful. Maid service is very poor. Basically make bed and replace towels. Not much cleaning done. Not that nice of a place overall - but for us it was all about LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. Especially if you are relying on metro and doing most activities in the Hollywood Area.;4
If you are going to events in and around Lincoln Center, this should be your #1 choice in a hotel.Thr lobby is elegant and the service is quite good. Rooms are a little small but comfortable, nicely decorated and with efficient temperature control. They are meant for tall people, however. I had to stand on tiptoe to hang up my clothes and the switch to change the shower from wand to rainhead was so over my head (5â 2â) that I had to call housekeeping. He was there in an instant, and we had a good laugh.;4
We arrived at the hotel filled with trepidation as we had, after booking our room for four days, seen a few recent negative reviews. We honestly cannot figure out what these reviewers were writing about: - Our room was clean, the bed a bit too soft for our liking, but it is a hotel. We were on the first floor facing the courtyard and really should have taken advantage of this serene-looking space. The shower water pressure was amazing! - The breakfast was super tasty - eggs and waffles prepared by the amazing Oralia. Yes, the restaurant is in the basement, but it didn't feel claustrophobic.  - The neighbourhood wasn't pretty, but we never felt concerned for our safety. we walked from the hotel to the Observatory and a mere mile away is a very funky neighbourhood of shops and;4
When I checked into the hotel I realized that I made the reservation for the wrong weekend. Pasquale, one of the front desk employees went out of his way to find me a room although the hotel seemed to be fully booked. I want to thank him for saving my weekend. The Empire Hotel should be proud of this excellent employee. I can't imagine anyone representing the hotel better, especially at the front desk at check-in! Thank you, Pasquale. I hope you will be there when I return next year.;4
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The rooms were clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable. Our view from the window wasn't the greatest but we didn't really spend any time in our room for that to matter. The grand entrance with 1920s design was beautiful. I love this style and it was just a great atmosphere to be in.;4
The location of the Empire Hotel was centrally located to everything we wanted to do and even when going into Brooklyn was easy to get to the appropriate trains. The staff was friendly and always very accommodating. The room was small, but unless you plan on sitting in your room all day, it was great. Comfortable bed.;4
We stayed at the Hilton Universal City/Los Angeles for five nights in July for its close location to the Universal Studio in Hollywood. We stayed in a room overlooking the Universal Studio. The room is clean, although the bathroom amenities are very basic if compared with similar hotels in Asia. It is only 5 minutes walk to the Universal City & Universal Studio.;4
"This was the second time I stayed at the Empire Hotel in Manhattan. I love staying at this location for the following reasons. *It is close enough to all of the attractions of Manhattan without being in the middle of the chaos.  *Great Restaurants within walking distance *TCKTS booth is directly behind in the Lincoln Center. (Great discounts to top productions)  *Lincoln Center is next door and frequently has performing arts going on, Ballet, Symphony, ect. *Central Park is just two blocks from the door. *Times Sqaure, as well as world class museums, are within a 15-20 min walk.  *This hotel is hip and stylish The things about this hotel that need improvement; *WIFI is costly *Rooms could be cleaner *Taxis loiter out in the front but when asked to have a ride they refuse. They";4
Spacious lobby, top-notch security, very gracious staff.  I liked that you had to show room key to get access to elevators.  Room was tastefully appointed closet.  Outstanding bar in the basement.  Nice location, walkable to either Penn Station or Hudson Yards.;4
Great location for getting around New York. Hotel was a little tired looking we had a Queen room which was a little small for 2 adults, but was in a good location and experienced no noise which was a bonus. Restaurants on site were good and convenient and the information desk team knowledgeable;4
I used to use the Jane all the time as my go-to hotel and hadn't visited for several years. The location is only getting better the more the area gets more popular. The new Whitney museum is a 5 minute walk or so and the restaurant options keep expanding as well. The hotel itself hasn't changed much. If you want SPACE, this isn't the place for you. But if you want a reasonable price for a place to just rest your head, you can't go wrong. I'm much more of a sound sleeper than the folks complaining about the noise. The single rooms are tiny so most likely you'll hear your neighbors. If they're noisy, let them know...it's only common sense. Or tell the front desk. Not sure if the carpets in the halls are dirty or there just isn't much light to be able to tell. And I don't mind;4
Wonderful location for those like me who love the opera.  Also convenient to the subway for those like me who aren't keen on taxis.  My room was very quiet and comfortable. Concierge helpful. Breakfast in a bright and delightful space with excellent buffet.;4
I was really dreading the hotel from the reviews i had read on here and was expecting the worst from the price i had paid. Got to the hotel and a very friendly doorman helped us with our bags. Lady on reception wasnt overly friendly but not horrible either. Word of warning take a master card or visa with you if u dont then u will have to pay $100 dollar deposit until you check out. The decor was clean and the atmosphere was pleasant. After checking in we got into the lift which is very small but it took two of us and two people sized bags.  The room was fresh clean and smelt nice. It was soooooo hot in the room but we turned off the radiator which i would advise. There is an ac/ fan unit attached to the window and we had it on most of the time. The bathroom was lovely with fresh;4
The location is excellent. There are plenty of security and concierge people to help. My room was tiny, although fairly modern. Wifi worked very good.  The rooms are quite noisy all day and night from city noise, including police sirens at low-frequency rumblers which shake everything. The hotel needs to invest more in soundproofing.  For a hotel of this price range, would it be so hard to have a mini-fridge come standard with the room?  Another issue - check in. We checked in at 1 AM, and had to wait about 10 minutes for the 1 guest in front of us who chatted incessantly with the front desk staff. At least we didn't check in during the day time - the 2 days we were there, the line was often 30+ people deep.  The fitness center was phenomenal - huge, with quite a few aerobic and;4
The location was excellent!  The hotel decor was beautiful but guest rooms and bathroom were tiny. The walls was also paper thin. Very disturbing to a couple trying to sleep in.;4
Great location. Close to subway and Upper West Side (American Museum of Natural History, Columbia, and across Central Park from the Met).  The neighborhood is vibrant and safe, with many good restaurants (I recommend the Peruvian place at the corner -Piu Piu). The winning feature for this hotel is definitely the price. You can't find anything in Manhattan at this price that will be as decent. Certainly, the hotel looks a bit run down, the elevators tiny, the rooms outdated and small. But it's clean and you don't hear people talk in the next room (although you hear from in the hallway, but many more expensive hotels have that issue).;4
We recently completed our fourth stay at this hotel (the second under the Wyndham banner) and it is our favorite city location. Close to the subway, Penn Station, charter bus stops (we bus up from the DC area), Broadway, and Times Square, it's location can't be beat and, by NYC standards, the price is reasonable. Great location for walking, with plenty of good restaurants nearby (which is good because you really need to skip the one in the hotel lobby).  Hotel staff is very friendly and you can not access the lobby elevators without showing your room card -- nice security touch. Bags can be stored for only $4 each and, while the drop off can take some time at checkout, pickup is generally quite fast.  We'll be back.;4
The Jane hotel is retro and classic in its design and decor. Hotels are super expensive in NYC and rarely can you find a hotel under $200 that won't be filthy. The Jane is cheaper however because your room is the size of a prison cell without your own toilet or shower but this suited me just fine. It is old and the carpet a little dated but that's all part of its charm. The shared bathrooms were super clean though. I love staying here because I can save a little money, it is in a great location in the Meatpacking district/ Greenwich Village with a trendy club and fab restaurant downstairs. The only thing that is a pain about the location is that all subwy stops are at least 3 blocks/ 10-15 min walk away. However you are in the heart of all the nightlife, restaurants and some;4
I keep my eye on their rates and try to book everyone of my stays in NYC at this hotel.. It is so convenient to Lincoln Center and close to Subway trains.. Love the rooftop bar.. some rooms are too small but still very well taken care of by the housekeeping staff;4
Really convenient location with subway station nearby Small size rooms but clean, good price for New York standards. I will recommend to go for breakfast on the dinners around the area instead of the hotelÂ´s restaurant- as price will be much better.  Overall, I would recommend for a stay in NYC, great and convenient location to move around.;4
3 night stay. Hardly in hotel . Beds extremely comfortable. Rooms are dated however the whole hotel is quirky. We had a double double which had 2 bathrooms. No kettle though.  Plenty of staff and wasnât aware of any issues. We paid our deposit etc by cash as heard there was issues with paying by card.  Good location for Penn station and Madison Sq Gardens;4
Good hotel, bathroom a little bit older, but very friendly  Staff. They where very helpfull with helping us for the Universal Studio. A good location for visiting Hollywood  and Beverly Hills. Breakfast was excellent.;4
We were looking for a reasonable priced (by NYC standards) hotel in the middle of the city since we were planning to be visit with friends in TriBeCa and Harlem and were pleasantly surprised by the Ameritania Hotel. Just a few blocks from Times Square and close to Central Park, this was the perfect location for our stay. Check-in was a breeze and the hotel staff were very helpful. The rooms are not large, but very modern, clean and well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable â almost too comfortable since we didn't want to get out of bed. The only downside was that our room was on the 3rd floor with a not-so-great view of the brick wall/patio of the restaurant next door. The noise from the patio was very loud at times, but it was tolerable. We never heard our neighbors;4
Had a interesting ride from JFK in minibus last on coach to be dropped off traffic nightmare but saw quite a bit of the surrounding area. Hotel has a lot off character we are on 28 floor lift look old but the workings must be new as they are quick the room are small but fine for us bath small but original fixtures if your over 5.10 take a shower prices for basics are exspecive so take note we paid 2 dollars for a small czn of coke not the normal uk size beds comfortable can hear some noise from next door rooms and the TV was rubbish but that was no major issue 3 dont drink water from hotel placed in rooms as you can see quite expensive.apart from these moans a must visit at some time and don't forget walking shoes;4
The hotel is literally across the airport. I can see the planes from the room. The rooms are nicely designed. Modern and there's a hint of minimalism in the design. The hallways are nice as well. I understand the hotel was just recently renovated so it looks new. Looking out the the window that's where you'll see signs of the old hotel. The side of the hotel room we stayed in has the view of the colour-changing pillars, it' s nice.  The lobby is quite spacious and again modern. Nice to hang out. There's a restaurant. I liked the fried pork belly dish. There's also a nice convenience type store where you could buy food, drinks, snacks, etc. Open 24/7. Try the Ramen.   Only a minor problem is the parking. There's limited parking beside. You have to park in the building beside. $16;4
The Hilton is the closest hotel to Universal Park, which is about a 5-10 minute walk, but they do have a shuttle.  Rooms are big and comfortable, staff is nice, and they have a $25 early check-in option available for early arrivers.  My only slight complaint, and it's not with the hotel, but when using Lyft, the Hilton is not an option - it's always the main entrance to Universal, which gets a little annoying if you use Lyft frequently on the trip.;4
I don't want to damn with faint praise, but this was a nice experience at this hotel. But that is what I've come to expect at Hilton properties. The staff was friendly and helpful-typical of my Hilton stays. Nice touches like free apples at the front desk 24-7, and an amazing (and not-too ridiculously-pricey for Hollywood)  breakfast buffet. I highly recommend booking a corner room because of the extra space and if available get one on the concierge level. Unfortunately, parking is not free and tacked onto your bill, but I understand nearly EVERY hotel in LA charges for that. Sheesh. My other usual whines: wireless is not free (again, typical of LA) and if I were king of the world all hotel showers would be glass-enclosed (this was not). However, the bathroom was mostly marble;4
Great location, super helpful staff, very clean and comfortable. Not fancy and a little dated but economical and just perfect for us - walking distance to everything but at the same time a few steps away from the mayhem of Times Square. Satisfied customers!;4
"The Hollywood Hotel was close to a metro system which made it accessible to tourist attractions, such as; the Hollywood Sign and the Griffith Observatory. Arriving at the hotel wasnât quite what we expected as the picture advertised are from the back of the hotel, however inside is exactly as shown and the room was comfortable and spacious.";4
A great quirky hotel, excellently located, we were in easy walking distance of Times Square, the Empire State and Broadway, the rooms were well appointed, if a little snug, we loved the Art-Deco original styling, which all looked original to our uneducated eyes! The bed was queen sized and comfortable, even though we didn't request clean towels every day we got them, I managed to break the safe in the closet, but staff were helpful and replaced it with out fuss or charge, the only downside to the hotel was the external noise, even on the 19th floor you constantly hear the traffic throughout the night, better double glazing would help, also we were woken twice by people using the showers in their rooms, but thats a minor gripe. Overall a good hotel with helpful friendly staff,;4
A very good hotel! De hotel is on the corner of 94th street and broadway and is just 2 streets away from the subway station 96th street --> line 2 brings you to times square whitin 15 minutes. The room has a kingsize bed and the shower has different massage positions what is nice but can make your bathroom a bit wet. On complaint about galahotels: I wanted to shorten my stay with 2 days, but as it was paid in advance I had to contact galahotels. Unfortunately e-mail can't be delivered and the phone is unreachable or picked up.;4
I don't drive so this was the perfect place for me to stay when going to Universal Studios for a visit.  You can use public transport and get really close to it using the underground metro system in LA.  I stayed for 3 nights, and was really impressed with the standards at this Hilton.  Although there is no longer an executive floor, they do still have a great bar near to the lobby.  I had an executive room which was very spacious and overlooked the interstate and the San Fernando valley area.  The sound insulation was good at this hotel, and I didn't mind the view too much as I was not in the room very often.  The hotel has a pool which I didn't use, but it did look very good.  The staff were very helpful, and were able to provide information on what activities there were in;4
We enjoyed our stay here. Although there is lobby construction, check in was smooth and staff were friendly. We paid extra for executive floor and continental breakfast. The room was great. Room 2255 has view of Hollywood Hills and pool. It was great. Noise was minimal. The room was somewhat plain but spacious. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Bathroom was very clean and new. The breakfast gave us a great start. Lots of options for a continental meal with really fresh fruit. The coffee was strong and delicious. We appreciated the help from the concierge and the bellhops in planning a day sightseeing and shopping. The pool was great and the jacuzzi even better. While the food overall was pricey, the coffee shop was good. We loved the closeness to city walk and;4
The hotel is in an excellent location - a 5 minute walk from Universal Studios. We received complimentary water on check in, because of Hilton Honors membership, which was nice. Room was on the 20th floor with a great view of Universal Studios. Beds were comfortable and room clean for the most part (a little dust here and there).  Breakfast buffet had a reasonable range of options.   Staff were professional and courteous.  Overall an enjoyable stay.;4
Traveled with daughter and grand daughters ( 12 & 10).  Room small double beds but ok for us. Very clean, beds very comfy. Need more mirrors.  Bathroom very very very small. No exhaust fan but we raised the window when necessary. It was a refurbished hotel. Service was excellent need more wash cloths (girls) and they responded instantly. we were on the 27th floor. Baggage hold and front desk very polite. We would stay again.  Convenient restaurant for breakfast.   Impressed with security.;4
The pictures definitely make it look nicer than it was, but it is a very decent hotel in a fabulous location.  Ed's Chowder House was a great dining option in the hotel.  Beware the elevators!  The rooftop lounge was less of a lounge and more of a Euro-style thumping club.  I'd like to go back in the summer and check out the rooftop pool, though.;4
The staff is great - reception desk, rooftop bar hostess and waitress, cleaning staff. The location could not be better - right across the street from Lincoln Center. Itâs very convenient to the theater district, but much calmer than those humongous Times  Square hotels. The bedding is comfortable and light-blocking curtains that I love. I was in an ADA accessible room because thatâs what was available when I arrived at night.   The safety problem is that the floor of the bathroom (Room 837) completely floods - like over an inch of water - when you run the shower. Instead of having the shower floor slope towards the drain in the shower, it slopes towards the center of the bathroom. Itâs very slippery! I stepped out of the bathroom to use the hairdryer for obvious reasons.  All;4
We stayed for a week at the start of January. At first we were given a room on the third floor, the room entrance in a stairwell, and presumably smoking because it reeked of marijuana. Outside the window was a bar so could not sleep as the window did nothing to keep out the noise (or the chill.)   We mentioned on the third day to reception about the cold as our heater done nothing to warm the room, and staff were quick to bring us a space heater but also offered us a change in room. We decided to swap rooms.  What a difference! It was on the sixth floor and the room was non-smoking, had air conditioning and heating worked a charm. Flat screen TV as compared to the other room's box which was older than the both of us who stayed.  I have to mention though that the wifi did not;4
We stayed here for 4 days in mid December,  It is a fair way up Central Park near the Cathedral.  The only problem we had was with the taxi drivers, they hated driving that far out, I guess all the fares are in Manhatten.  Hotel basic, but am led to believe that hotels in New York for this time of year are horrendously expensive.  In any event, was clean, comfortable and the bathroom was spotless, I am a clean freak and was really pleased.  The staff couldn't do enough, they were helpful, informative, friendly, everything you could hope for, they booked the minibus back to the hotel for us and it collected us from the hotel to Newark $45.  We had a cab when we arrived at it was double.  We were really pleased and would stay here again.;4
My first trip to New York and I was struggling to find a hotel that was within my budget as well as being close enough to the places I wanted to visit.  It took me a couple of weeks to find this great little hotel.  I ended up search Google for quirky hotels and found a great article in the Daily Telegraph.  The hotel lived up to the article and provided a great place to explore New York from, the staff were always courteous and helpful beyond the daily needs of the travel.  The hotel bar(s) were fantastic and I enjoyed watching the Hudson from the rooftop bar.  I would return to The Jane in the future.;4
Originally booked NYC for April 2020 to visit family but obviously with Covid itâs taken until now to get there & when the opportunity to travel at Christmas came up we jumped at the chance! This wasnât the hotel we originally booked but it turned out to be better than our first choice. Location is brilliant, slap bang in mid town, opposite Madison Square Garden so easy walking distance to Times Square, Empire State is 5 minutes away and the High Line & Hudsons Yard 10 minutes. We also walked the 25 minutes to Central Park which is a straight route from the hotelâ¦â¦this was our second visit to NYC so did know our way around a little. Penn Station is 2 minutes away and the subway is fairly easy to navigate. Our rooms were a little on the small side and a bit dated but for the;4
I loved this place---even though standing in the middle of the room, I could actually touch the walls on both sides of the room!  it's small, but it had all I needed---and was only $99---I enjoyed walking on the Hudson River and the new High Line Park---it's right by it!  Staff excellent, friendly, helpful--restaurant EXCELLENT food! and great atmosphere---don't know about the larger rooms, but mine was small but adequate---charming building--just really nice.;4
I stayed at the Empire for a quick night. I've stayed there several times before. I love the convenient location. This time, however, I had a leaky faucet in the bathroom which caused the floor to be wet. I thought I could put up with it for one night. In the end, I should have called maintenance because I paid for the room and shouldn't have accepted its present condition.;4
Room is spacious and clean. Parking price should be clearly stated on the ads as it is pricey. Toilets are the smaller, rounded toilets (not a good option). Service is good and reasonable. Food (breakfast) is excellent.;4
"This hotel is located in a 110 year old building.  It's been updated, but it's still a bit old fashioned in a funky sort of way.  There are two kinds of accommodations: rooms that share a common bathroom/shower facility on the same floor; and captain's quarters that have their own bathroom.  We're past the time in our lives when roughing it appeals to us, so we stayed in a Captain's Quarters room.  My only complaint was that the air conditioning wasn't really up to the task and it was a bit warm for me at night (my husband was fine, however).  The Jane has a lot of ""action"" going on, especially on the weekend, so request a room away from the party room.  We didn't notice any noise in our room, which faced the Hudson River on the 5th floor.  The price was fairly reasonable given";4
Overall, the hotel was very nice and we would stay again.  The door man was very helpful in advising us on how to travel around the city and the hotel management was very nice.  THe room walls however are paper thin and you can hear your neighbors loud and clear!;4
Went on a business trip, got a corner room, with view facing Universal Studio, Harry Potter Castle, Hollywood Hills.  Room is 'huge' for solo traveler, and kept clean.  There's coffee maker, mini fridge, a couch, coffee table and desk facing the windows.  Love the windows - amazing view (too bad, not much time to enjoy being in the room). Can't beat the location for family visiting Universal Studio.  Walking distance to Universal City with various shops and restaurants.  Have to find the stairs to cross the bridge to Universal City.  Not a big deal, once you found the stairs.  Breakfast buffet was great, unlimited choice.  There are other dining options, didn't have time to try them.  Hotel ground is beautiful.  Didn't have enough time to enjoy the pools, etc,... mostly work, no;4
Arrived at the hotel around 10am after a long flight from Australia. Didn't think we would be able to get into our room that early but thought we'd give it a try anyway. Michelle at the front desk was super friendly and offered us the option of paying for an early check-in which, for the small price, we gladly accepted.   The hotel building and interior is a little dated but generally clean and comfortable. The best thing, however, is the close distance to Universal Studios theme park which we had planned to do straight away. There's a complimentary shuttle that departs the hotel and the park every 10 mins and it's about a 5-10 minute drive.  This is a perfect option if you're planning on spending the day at the theme park or other sights close by.;4
After three weeks on the road LA was our final destination and the Hilton fitted the bill well. Good hotel within an easy walk to Universal Studios and Citywalk. Hotel was easy to check into and efficient. We had a corner room which was a good size, above average compared to some other Hiltons.   The buffet breakfast was reasonably priced and provided a good variety. The Cafe/bar food was also pretty good.  The tour desk staff were great. Friendly, efficient and helpful. The tour suggested was pretty good and the ride to Hollywood quick along the 101.  Overall, a good experience in a good hotel. A relaxing end to our US trip.;4
We were really worried when checking into the hotel after some of the recent comments about this hotel. But overall we were really happy with our room. The beds were really comfortable, we always had hot water, didn't have any concerns about our safety and the location was really convenient. The only negative was the hotel staff were a little unfriendly when checking in and only 2 elevators were working during our stay, meaning we usually gave up waiting and instead took the stairs. Whilst the hotel was a little dated, overall for the price we paid and the quiet location, we were happy.;4
Great hotel. Convenient to where we need to go.  Personnel was very helpful. Clean and great shower in our room. Breakfast was a let down as it was overpriced and not very good.  Room was clean and noise was a minimum  but we had ear plugs;4
A typically good hilton hotel. The rooms were a bit older but its not too bad, and its clean. Decent size room. The universal bus runs every 15 mins, so that was very convient. We did breakfast buffet and that was great. Lots of variety to eat Wish we were able to try their weekend Seafood Dinner Buffet. But it $50 per person, so we had to pass.;4
Great place to stay right where you need to be to do the sights. Staff where all great and couldnât do enough for us, sorted our taxis as well. Its an old place so the rooms are a bit small, but its clean and well kept. Would most definitely stay again.;4
"I have stayed here several times while visiting New York most recently in July.This is a great historical hotel and centrally located with the subway just a few steps out the door.The rooms are comfortable albeit small New York style.The staff have always been friendly, helpful and without exception have been able to accommodate my red-eye check in. It certainly could use a ""spring makeover"" but I will stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting New York.The hospitality, location and affordability can't be beat!";4
The hotel is directly situated at LAX. Rooms are clean and very spacious. Staff is very friendly. Late check-out was offered to me as a complimentary option. I was very happy about that. The buffet breakfast was great. Only small deception was the choice offered as room service and at the restaurant.;4
Stayed over Christmas and am 100% satisfied. Every staff member was friendly and courteous. Very convenient location. The Tick Tock diner, while a diner, had outstanding service.   We had a slow running drain in the shower which was fixed within about an hour of us reporting it.   My wife......who works in the hospitality industry....reminds me that the shower had some mildew in it, so that's why it's a 4 star rating.   Property overall is in great shape. Rooms are appropriately sized for a downtown hotel.   Will stay again.;4
Great location, good room. Very helpful and friendly staff.  Secure. No one admitted to elevators without your room key, and that's good.  If there were coffee pots in the rooms, that would be nice.  Or at least complimentary coffee in the lobby, but instead, there's a fairly pricey coffee bar in the lobby.;4
Hotel is in a good location, opposite Madison Square Gardens. First impressions of the hotel is that it is well used but is clean, which I believe is all you need for a city break as we spent very little time in the hotel. Stayed on the 24th floor and had a view of Empire State Building. Hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. Good security. Free WiFi. Overall good value and I would stay here again.;4
All of the staff I encountered were notably courteous and helpful. Stewart at the front desk was especially welcoming. The rooms were very clean, classy, and comfortable.   The location was a reasonably short walk to the Universal Studios park and CityWalk, although the route was a bit poorly marked and confusing. Still, it was nice to be located so close and have views of the Studios and the variety of options so conveniently located.  My company was hosting a series of meetings and banquets at their site and (although I cannot speak for the meeting planner who coordinated the contract or other advance details), from a guest perspective they helped each of our events run seamlessly. Even their catered banquet meals were a step above what I have typically/frequently found at;4
The location of the hotel is good. 1 block from the 96th metro station. The hotel is clean, the accommodations are ok. It is also close to the Central Park. There are many options for breakfast and dinner around.;4
Just returned from a 2 week stay at Morningside Inn (June 2015).  This place is one of the cheapest hotels we could find in New York, in Manhattan. We booked a double bed with ensuite.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for those on a budget. Yes, it is not the most modern, luxurious or fancy hotels in New York, but for those who are budget-conscious, and just want a decent bed for the night, that's clean, in a good location, this is perfectly fine.  The location is great - a quick subway ride to all the main sites - and the hotel itself is very close to the 110 Street subway station on the 1 line.  Supermarkets, shops, pharmacies, bagel shops and restaurants all very close to the hotel.   The rooms are tiny, but I think this is normal for New York. We just unpacked all of;4
Well appointed bedrooms with very comfy bed.  Nicely decorated with microwave, fridge, and coffee maker.Very noisy extractor in the bathroom which can be annoying.  The reception area and breakfast rooms are spacious and well decorated.  Breakfast was adequate for inclusive, but the same thing every morning. We found it strange that the hotel didn't seem to have a restaurant and information in the room indicated that you could have food from outside sources delivered to your room. Also the bar was only open on certain days when they then had 'open mike' sessions.  This did not seem to reflect the size and quality of the hotel. Whatever, we had a good stay, reception staff were helpful and even printed our boarding pass for us.  We didn't have time to use the swimming pool, but;4
We arrived at the hotel and parked in the self parking...I believe it was $17 a night.  We took the elevator up to the lobby.  However, the lobby was a long walk from the elevator and there were no signs directing us. We checked in with a very friendly young man who obviously expected a tip. When one is expected, we tend not to give one. We entered our room and were pleasantly surprised by the size and nice appointments.  It was an alcove room, which was an upgrade. The far wall was all windows.  The view was incredible. The only time I heard another guest was from our restroom.  The bedroom was extrememely quiet and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the linens were just as amazing. Check out was a breeze. My only complaints were the distance we;4
This hotel is a well appointed hotel that seems out of place in its surroundings. It is relatively easy to find just off highway 101. It is close to the Metro so you donât need to drive to the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Blvd or Universal Studios. The hotel has good vegetation around it that makes it look good.  I got a large and comfortable room on the ground floor. It was a bit noisy next to the back entrance with the elevator opposite, but not too noisy that I failed to sleep. The room is well equipped with closet and kitchen area. The room had an iron and board, microwave oven, refrigerator, and safe. There is a coffee make but it makes only a single cup of coffee. There were ample towels and toiletries. There was a flat panel TV with options to pay for movie rental.  The pool;4
I always enjoy my stays at the Hyatt. This hotel is very nice, lively bar seen after 7pm and great rooms. The beds are okay, wish the sheets were softer and pillows more fluffy. The decor is really nice as well. It does have an outside pool which is cool. A lot of books and crannies and areas to do work, individually or large groups.;4
Hilton is running a first class hotel chain. The Hilton Hollywood Universal City franchise is excellent, great food and service, good views, and, most important, within walking distance to Universal Studios, good value.;4
Near metrÃ´ station Vermont/Santa Monica and in walking distanceto the Griffith Observatory (1 hour walking). Organized and clean. Atentious staff Very good rooms with microoven and cafÃ© Sugestion: bring your forks and knifes;4
A night before your flight you find the Hyatt convenient to the airport. They have 24hr shuttle transportation. A wonderful gift shop on the premises. The food is good for lunch and dinner. They offer a lobby bar and cafe type market place. There is plenty of staff to meet your needs. The room with a view looks out on runway. It is quite comfortable with a mini refrigerator, flat screen, work area, and a comfortable bed. If you are to tired to leave room service is available to your room. The bathroom was functional and pleasantly decorated. The surprise was the large pool out back with nice lounges. On a nice day you can certainly relax. Oh nice business center too! Pretty spacious.;4
There were plenty of choices for the free breakfast in the morning, including omelettes and waffles cooked to order (still free). The staff was also very friendly and helpful. When my noisy next door neighbors woke me up, I called the front desk, and they immediately asked them to quiet down. The hotel was also 5 blocks from the hospital I was visiting and the subway (which the staff made me aware of) was only 2 blocks away. My rating would be higher except that there were some tiny stains on my linens and water damage along the baseboard in the bathroom. Additionally, crickets kept coming through the window, but I think if you don't stay on the 1st floor, that would be less of a problem. I have to go back to LA next month, so I'll probably stay here again.;4
Just returned from our first trip to New York and stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker , Found the location of the hotel great we were to walk to a lot of the sites ,Central Park ,rocker feller centre ,grand central station, maceys etc  .The hotel I found really good check in no problem had two rooms one being a double room two double beds the room was great really good size the other a metro with queen size bed was small but we found it fine. The bed  was really comfortable clean sheets and lovely fluffy towels bathroom little dated but clean . Next to the hotel is the tick tock diner we ate breakfast in there a few times really enjoyed trying different omelettes  and pancakes each day. I would defiantly return to this hotel it built in the 1930s had a feel of old New York and Art;4
My daughter and I stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is not big or fancy, but very stylish and clean. The rooms were compact but very well appointed with a great shower! For being in such a central location the rooms were very quiet. I come to New York regularly and this was one of the best value hotels I have stayed at in the past 5 years. The staff was helpful, especially Julian who helped us get a car to LGA. We had a problem with the toilet the first night and someone came up to fix it immediately.;4
The location cannot be beat.  Friends have an apartment nearby, and we were able to enjoy their neighborhood favorite places simply by walking. Happy to be able to get so quickly into the park from the hotel.;4
The Jane is a nice place for a good cocktail and beers. It's not a party place, but a spot to hang out and talk with friends. There's an amazing view over Hoboken. Would highly recommend. 10/10 would go again.;4
If you are going to Lincoln Center or the vicinity, then this is the place for you!  The Empire is located right across the street. There are also good restaurants all around and it's a great location in general.  I stayed at the Empire Hotel twice in two months - once for business in June 2011 and the second time on vacation in August 2011.  I was very satisfied with the hotel and the staff both times and would highly recommend it. Everything is very clean and the beds are so comfortable. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  They provide L'occitane toiletries - shampoo, hand cream, etc. - which is a big plus...love it!  The only minus was that the room - the second time - was really small.   The other thing is that - both times - the price was pretty high (even for;4
Nice place but the bath rooms are a little beat up. They have some trim and finishing issues but still function fine. Rooftop lounge is chill, but somewhat hard to get to. Staff were all great. They allow early luggage drop off which was nice.;4
"This was our 2nd stay.  Location is great, rooftop bar/pool deck also great.  Decor is starting to look a bit tired from our last stay.  Some areas need painting...  Bathroom is not made for primping.  I kept dropping things on the floor which landed behind the toilet.  Gross!  Not a fan of the open shower.  The partial door was  a little moldy at the bottom.  Not cool.  Towels could be fluffier and we weren't given enough.  Too much inside noise at night (doors constantly slam).  I hate that.  That said...we got a great rate including breakfast ($179/Memorial day weekend) and the roof makes up for a lot.  It really is spectacular.  I can put up with a bad night's sleep in a nice place if I'm not paying a fortune.  Next time, I'll bring my Tylenol pm so it's ""good night, Irene""!";4
"Location was super, nearby the subway. 20 Blocks to Times Square. The only thing we were ""missing"" was the free wi-fi in our room. Clean and super friendly Hotel. Great Rooftop Bar with a nice view. If there was free wi-fi in the rooms, we'd come again for sure.";4
There is a lot to like about the Empire -- terrific views of Lincoln Center, proximity to both Central Park and the theaters, boutique style, and manageable size.  The rooms are well appointed. If you can afford it, I recommend getting the larger deluxe room, well worth the extra cost.  The hotel is very clean and the maid staff does a great job.  Comfortable lobby and a fine lobby bar (not part of the restaurant).  Drawbacks- the rooms with the views can be noisy with street traffic.  The restaurant (Ed's on mezz level) is very disappointing -- disinterested and terrible service, mediocre food at best, and way overpriced (even by NYC standards). It's almost shockingly bad overall. Fortunately there are many very good restaurant options at all price levels nearby. We  had a;4
So me and my wife have just spent 8 nights at the Empire Hotel and we were extremely happy with our stay. We arrived and were greeted by friendly and attentive staff. The gentleman we checked in with enquired as to the nature of our stay, and due to it being our honeymoon he insured we had a room with a view.   Once we got to the room, we were again very happy with what we had been assigned. The room looked over Broadway and West 63rd. We had air conditioning which was hugely appreciated given the heat at the time. The room was a nice size with a queen size bed, desk, chair and a small chest of drawers. We were allowed to bring our own food in to consume in our room which was nice as some hotels can be a little awkward with that.  Admittedly the decor is a little outdated, and;4
Come out of the 59th Street subway on the Upper West Side at night, look up and you'll see The Empire Hotel sign in red high above all the buildings.  It guided us to the hotel one very rainy night in New York when we weren't sure which way to go as we came out of the subway!   We stayed at the Empire over the holidays.  It's in a great location directly across from the street from Lincoln Center.  Normally we stay downtown but during this trip we never left the Upper West Side except to go to the theatre.  There is plenty to do and lots of great restaurants, shopping, movies and museums to keep you busy.  Or take a walk over to Central Park and down Fifth Avenue. Our room - quiet and at the end of the hall, good sized with amenities that included Frette robes, crisp linen;4
"We purchased our room on Hotwire and did not notice any decline in customer service as many claim happens when making reservations through a third party site.  We arrived very early in the morning to check our bags and were subsequently upgraded to a king superior room. We can't comment on the size of the regular rooms, but our room was clean, comfortable and attractively outfitted with a great view of Lincoln Center.  Pool deck was nice for an afternoon nap; drinks were overpriced even for NYC.  The bathroom, as others have noted, is poorly designed.  While the pressure in the shower was excellent, the water went everywhere without a full shower door.  There is not adequate storage for even a modest packer.  While attractive and modern, the sink is miniscule, didn't drain";4
Very convenient location surrounded by restaurants and transportation. We had a room on the 23rd floor, a little small but still very nice. They offer early check in and late check out for a small additional fee which was super convenient. Weâll be staying here again should we choose to come back to the city.;4
I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend just for a fun getaway. The pool and rooftop top was great we checked in before it closed. Service was great , Amanda at the front desk was incredibly kind and friendly she gave great recommendations for dinner and even complimented the photo on my Drivers license. The room was also great , would definitely return.;4
The hotel is near Central Parc and near the subway ð  and the area is pretty quiet.. The rooms have an old style, they really need some renovations !! The staff was really nice and helpful and the room was always well cleaned !;4
"Not bad at all.  Not full value for what we paid but it was a good stay; I would stay again.   Room #1036 had a decent view.  The furniture was stained but not horrible.  Only 1 regular coffee pod for the maker, which makes little sense.  Asks for ice and 2 glasses but they never came.  Still, the breakfast was pretty good.  Call down to the front desk on check if your valeted the car.  Texting the company does not work and we had to wait a while for our car because of that.";4
We stayed only a night at the New Yorker. The public spaces have recently been refurbished and are elegant and lovely. The staff were attentive and helpful and the rooms were a good size. Although the public spaces have been refurbished, the room we had has not and was perfectly functional, but a little bit dated. Nonetheless we thought it was well located and good value for money.;4
This is a nice hotel, if a little old now. A few minor issues (e.g. the pool was closed temporarily, the electrical outlet in the bathroom not working) but nothing that could spoil the best feature of this hotel, which is its location. So close to Universal Studios and Universal City Walk that we could see the shows from our room window. Very pleasant and friendly staff too. I will definitely be staying here again.;4
Stayed last month for 4 days. Very convenient for a visit to Universal Studios and also to downtown LA. There is a metro station 10 minutes walk away which has a direct line to LA. So easy and cheap to use. I am a Hilton Honours member but on this occasion booked with an agent as it was so much cheaper. Staff were friendly, rooms were clean and great location.;4
Great hotel in a charming part of the city.  Loved the accessibility to the High Line Park & walking trail and the Chelsea Market.  Spacious room that was super clean with comfortable beds.  Lots of shopping and art galleries in the area.;4
Nice, clean hotel located next to Universal Studios Hollywood. Rooms are large, have excellent amenities and views. Free shuttle to City Walk and the park entrance. There's parking under the hotel. Staff is friendly, breakfast is excellent. There is also a Peet's Coffee shop off the lobby.;4
Max was wonderful! Made lots of fun drinks.  We simply gave an alcohol, he chose the combo and provided a new one every time. He was very friendly and it was a good spot to be to break from our conference.;4
This was a great hotel! I felt safe and secure walking from their gated parking lot to the hotel throughout the night. The hotel was modern and fun. The room was clean and comfortable.  Nicole was an absolute doll at the front desk! I happened to call a few days before I made my reservation to ask about the safety of the location and she gave spot on advice! Got to meet her upon check out and she was just as sweet and helpful. She has great customer service!  My only complaint was that they had a water pipe issue which caused no hot water in the rooms. I wanted to take a shower before hitting the road and was not willing to take a cold shower.;4
I've read the neagative reviews and either the management is new altogether or has changed. I stayed for 16 days with my mother and teenage daughter. When we checked in, the lobby was average in appearance at best and we were a little concerned. We were still concerned when we stepped off the elevator into the hall. The appearance was fine but it was warm and humid and a little musty smelling. When we opened the room to our apartment, it was beautiful. It had hardwood floors and the whole apartment had a fresh smell. Everything worked well: A/C, plumbing, kitchen appliances. The staff was super friendly and accomodated every request in a prompt manner. They suggested restaurants, gave us tips for negotiating New York, and we felt very secure with a 24 hour front desk. They even;4
This is my favourite hotel in NYC - great location, great rooms, great staff. Close proximity to all the best bars (corner bistro!) and cafes (they Grey Dog!) in the West Village and close to the subway. Great for a morning run along the Hudson.;4
Stayed 3 nights Thursday 12th March to 15th, nice hotel, very friendly staff, very welcoming even when we arrived at 1.30am. Very clean room and lobby, all areas well cleaned daily, water bottles replaced each day, towels also. Coffee and tea available at all times. Hotel in a nice friendly neighbourhood, close to bars cafes and supermarkets. Central Park right opposite front door. All in all a well regarded 3 star hotel, we would stay here again.;4
As the title says location is wonderful. Penn station across the road. Ideal if you are flying into Newark.  Room was very disappointing. Room 3304. Tiny with the smallest queen bed.  It was also freezing cold unless you had the very loud very uncomfortable air con on. This would make the room unbearably stuffy.  Staff were very helpful.  We asked for an extra blanket which arrived within minutes. Sorry we did not ask the first night. Also got extra towels. Had an issue with the toilet and again janitor arrived in minutes.   Could do with a facelift. But can see that would cost millions.   Overall itâs location and friendly helpful staff make it a great choice for NY. And excellent value for money.;4
My partner and I travelled to NYC for a 5 night break to celebrate my 50th birthday.  Arrived at the hotel and were greeted by friendly reception staff.  Our room was on the 26th floor and overlooked the Empire State Building which was a short distance from the hotel.  Although the room was small it was clean, it had a Queen size bed, ensuite, tv and phone.  What more would you need?  The New Yorker is midtown and close to many tourist attractions - Madison Square Gdns, Empire State, Broadway, Macy's, Times Square to name a few.  Penn station is literally across the street and gives easy access to the subway to visit Uptown and Downtown NY.  There is a gym and a 24hr diner 'Tick Tock's, an Italian bar Trattoria Bianca all within the hotel.  The staff on the information desk were;4
Great Location. Great team member at desk and door. Mourad, SaÃ¯d, Marouane are really Professional.  But room cleaning was not Perfect bed sheet had been change 1 time in a week after rÃ©clamation  Carpet have To be change.   Good hotel in Manhattan;4
Though I mainly booked this hotel due to an offer at the time of booking (made it incredible value for money!) I ended up leaving there thinking I will probably book it again next time I'm in the city. The area is very busy and crowded but it's also very close to big attractions and super convenient for travel. You're right by Penn station and it made it so easy for us to get to and from JFK airport and any Manhattan location we wanted or needed by bus or Metro.  I didn't try the diner on the ground floor but it looked popular and the hotel staff was friendly and efficient at check-in despite the crowds. I received my keys already at noon which was a pleasant surprise as I had mentally prepared myself for quite the wait until 3pm but the cheerful receptionist took care of that;4
I love this hotel - full stop.  I love the Art Deco presentation and love the presence that it has on the skyline.  The first time we stayed we got upgraded into a queen suite on the 38th or 39th floor which was amazing - huge suite with an absolutely incredible view of the city and of the Empire State Building.  The 2nd time we went we didn't get an upgrade and just had a small room with no real view which wasn't great at all so we have seen both sides of it.  Despite being a little underwhelmed 2nd time round I would without hesitation stay here again because of location location location.  I've always preferred the west side of manhattan and you are just minutes from penn st station which has a lot of key subway routes for getting around - ABC & 123 - (not to sound like;4
Room was really nice and was spacious enough considering in New York. Was in a good area - walking distance from Times Square but also beside the subway system. 2 min walk from central park. Excellent staff at reception.;4
"Nice hotel in Times Square.  Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are steps out the entrance.  The minute you walk out of the hotel you are in the ""thick"" of NYC - people and action everywhere morning and night.  If you are looking for a quiet location, this is not it.  We heard that the rooms are small, but we stayed the New Yorker twice in June and both times had large (by NYC standards) rooms - possibly because we are Wyndham Rewards members.  The rooms were updated and well appointed.  The bathrooms are very small, however, with only elbow room and not space to keep a toiletry bag - other on a towel shelf.  Other than that, the room was great!  If you want to be in the center of NYC action as well as a nice hotel for a reasonable price, the New Yorker is it.";4
This Hilton Hotel 'gets it' - they are here for TOURISTS and VACATION Guests.  People that want to have a wonderful time and be treated WELL.  Everyone we met went out of their way to make us feel welcome and that they were available to help in any way they could.   We were upgraded to Executive King (Alcove) Rooms on the 20th floor.  Very spacious and comfortable room.  LARGE bathroom with beautiful tub/shower combination - separate sit down vanity from sink/vanity area.   Bed was comfortable, room was QUIET.  No hall way noise at all.  Pool is open 24/7 and you can purchase a drink at the bar inside and move out to the pool cabanas to relax at the end of the day.   Shuttle Service to City Walk/Universal Tour.  Easy downhill walk back to the hotel.   Very pleased with my stay;4
I really liked the hotel, most of the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Just know that they definitely do not do car rentals at the hotel, even though it was listed in amenities. But other than that we really liked it, itâs really close to Universal studios, they offer a shuttle bus that takes you to and from the hotel, they said if we wanted we could walk it but itâs all hills there so Iâm really glad they had a shuttle.;4
Max took care of us at the restaurant. The service was great. The food was good and the service was fast. Will look forward to return. Great to be able to relax at our vacations. Hope the Review is helpful.;4
We stayed at Morningside Inn for five days in the Upper West Side of New York.  The hotel is well run, there is little noise from other guests and the rooms are a decent size.  The staff are very helpful.  Finding a hotel room in New York for a reasonable price is difficult but I'd recommend this hotel even though it is a few stops on the subway from downtown.;4
It is what it is, room is small but so what ? Most comfy bed i have ever slept in, staff friendly..handy to trains and buses. Would avoid venturing anywhere other than colombus circle at night, as the local eateries not tourist friendly, otherwise a great location to see the real new york.;4
Just the job for site seeing in New York, clean and tidy room and well appointed bathroom. Should of had free WI-FI in the rooms though, Said at the door was very helpful with our bags upon arrival and departure.;4
Best position to visit Universal Studios. Average rooms for price. Good food especially during happy hour - half price snacks in bar. Buffet Breakfast has a wide range of uncooked items. Rooms were small and not to the standard I expected for the price -definitely not luxury.;4
I went to Universal Studios for the first time in many years and wanted a great experience so I booked the closest hotel for the day before and night after. The Hilton is basically 'on the lot' with the Sheraton Universal right next door, both are roughly a 7 minute walk, but the Hilton was cheaper. Arriving is a bit complicated with various freeway off-ramps and streets and signs guiding you where to go. I made some mistakes and had to backtrack but eventually found my my way to their self-parking ($17 a day). After parking it's a bit of a journey to wander through the complexity of the hotel to get to the front desk to check-in. I suppose if one went to the main entrance and was valet shuttled it would be easy, but also cost more. Check-in went smoothly and I was upgraded to a;4
Well located hotel near Columbus Circle. Good facilities and friendly, helpful staff. Only negatives - room decor was a bit tired (didn't detract from the trip though) and no free WI-FI (but lots of NY hotels are the same);4
The hotel was nice, and the rooms were clean. They were very small, and there as an extra charge for everything. However, the cost made up for a great room in a great part of town. Free access to the club upstairs with no wait in line was a nice added benefit especially if you want to hit a real New York club but maybe wouldn't go seek it out on your own.;4
Attended a convention.  Quaint hotel... typical NYC rooms... small and even smaller bathroom but it worked!  Having a stall shower was a plus.  Lots or road noise but it's NYC.  Staff was wonderful and could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Would stay here again.  Great location.;4
"Clean hotel, close to universal studios, reasonable price, would stay again.  Location: If you buy a 2 day pass for Universal Studios then this is a great hotel to stay in. It's close walk to the theme park and also close to universal city walk for food. We did catch the train into hollywood to check it out and do a ""day in LA"" tour - I felt the train was a bit threatening (and I am normally fine on trains around the world) - I would recommend catching a taxi instead.   Room: clean room, clean bathroom, good view.  Service: reasonable service, nothing spectacular, but got the job done. I recall the check in line was a bit long but nothing unbearable.";4
I was really worried about staying at this hotel after getting it through name your price on priceline and then reading up horrible reviews. I really did not know what to expect. Well tonight is my first night here and I must say that the room is perfectly fine, clean and comfortable. I would recommend the hotel to anyone.;4
We stayed here just two nights to chill out before our long flight back to Australia.  The taxi from the airport where we had to drop off our rental car cost us $80 (ouch!) - we could have caught the train we later found out but with changes at different stations and way too many bags to lug around we still wouldn't have considered this option.  The hotel is really nice and we got the choice of two double beds which is always a nice option because it means a bigger room.  The bathroom was really big and the bed's comfortable.  The concierge and check-in staff were really attentive which was nice and gave us a recommendation of a chinese restaurant that delivered to the hotel. We also had room service one night which was good food but as is always the case, not cheap. CityWalk is;4
Lovely hotel and within a 10 minute walk of time square. The staff were friendly. Room was perfect for what I needed. I was out all day and only needed to rest my head at night so I did not eat or drink in the hotel. It was clean. Had a nice little view.;4
It is an older hotel so do not expect anything else. Rooms are small but clean and functional. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Prices are very reasonable. Centrally located to Penn Station and the subway to every other attraction. The staff were friendly and very helpful. There are several restaurants attached to the hotel. We tried the Tick Tock diner. The food was very tasty and again service was exceptional. This is an older hotel. Rooms are going to be smaller, and somewhat outdated. The rooms are clean,  staff is friendly and helpful, prices are very reasonable, and it is centrally located. We enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again.;4
Location is very convenient.  The hotel is across from Lincoln Center and near some great shopping (less than a 10 minute walk to Century 21 department Store which is amazing). I really loved the look of the hotel both inside and out.  Inside, it is nice, the dÃ©cor is dark but  sexy.  Check-in was efficient and the rep was pleasant. The room itself was very nice, especially the view of Lincoln Centre and the city. The hotel supplies l'Occitane toiletries which are my favourite. The bathroom is awkward though. The shower stall has an exposed wall which caused water to get on the floor. The bathroom sink is very small and was awkward for someone who wears contacts and needs a ledge to set my case and there wasn't one.   Overall the room was lovely, very clean and the bed was;4
We stayed in a Penthouse room on the 13th floor from July 15-19. It was under $200/night including taxes. Everything looked brand new and was very clean. I was expecting a small room because it's in NYC, but this room was surprisingly big. It had a couch, a desk, nice flat screen tv, king bed, etc. I was very satisfied with my stay in the hotel. The subway was 2 minutes from the hotel and there is also a stop 2 minutes away for the Hop N Go tour bus, which is phenomenal by the way. I would definitely recommend this hotel, just book a renovated room on one of the top floors and you will love it. I would stay here again the next time I am in the city.;4
We booked this hotel through the Hilton web pages and got a great deal for our stay in mid October, we requested a non smoking room above the 16th floor and got what we wanted on the 18th and on a corner of the building, views over the valley towards the mountains.   I must admit that in some of the floors, the corridors and areas look very tired, but having noted the the reviews by others in regard to the ongoing renovation, get a room as high as you can. The rest of the hotel appeared as to the standard expected, got pastries and coffee for a few bucks just before pick up for our tour 09:00, fast efficent restaurant staff.  Eat at the Universal City or locally, lots of Diners etc.   Excellent location for the freeway and a 5 minute ride on the shuttle bus to Universal City;4
We recently stayed in The Empire Hotel on a 4 night stay in New York. I was a bit dubious after reading mixed reviews but I can honestly say I canât fault the hotel. From the helpful lobby staff to the room service, we had an amazing stay. The rooms are generous in size and the beds are amazingly comfy - perfect after a full day of site seeing. The location is perfect, situated only a 1 minute walk from Central Park and you can easily walk into Timesquare in about 15 mins or jump on the underground. As some other reviews state, it can be quite noisy at times with the traffic but where isnât in New York! The noise didnât stop us from sleeping or enjoying our stay. Ignore the poor reviews, we loved it and would definitely be recommending to friends and family planning their trips;4
I stay here at least once a year when traveling to Los Angeles for business and its always a pleasure. The rooms have just been renovated and they are always nice and clean. They have a parking lot in the back thats unfortunately about $20/night to park in, but that seems to be the case just about every nice place you stay in LA. They have a (very) small gym in case you wanted to squeeze in a quick workout as well. All in all its a very clean and friendly place with a great central location if you are going to be doing a lot of running around all over Hollywood and LA in general, though it is a bit further from some parts of town, such as Santa Monica.;4
Amazing time. Beds a little hard but other wise great location and great price and its Chuck Bass's hotel!       The staff was very friendly. They made you feel welcome and helped with anything that you needed.;4
Similar to the Hudson but the rooms are a little larger, the views a little better and the rooftop bar even cooler.  We had a great view of Lincoln Center that I am sharing. There is a higher noise level from the streets and so much so the room has earplugs.  Great proximity to Columbus Circle and thus dining from 3 star Michelins all the way to diners.  I have to say The Smith restaurant across the street had a fantastic breakfast.  The subway is just around the corner too.;4
This is the closest hotel to Universal Studios. It is literally a 5 minute walk to the entrance, or there is a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes. There is also on-site parking. At $28 per day for self-parking or $40 for valet it is a bit steep price wise. The staff is very helpful at his hotel. It includes the Sierra CafÃ©, but beware the prices here are high for the buffet menus. It also has a lounge for drinks or bar menus. Plus there is a small coffee shop. There is an outside pool that also has a bar. The rooms are good and fairly large. if you can get a room with a view over the park. Bathrooms could do with an update, but are adequate. While I was there it took a while to get an elevator, as they were working on them. A good hotel if you want to be close to Universal;4
My wife and I stayed at the Astor on the Park in early February.  It was cold cold cold when we were in NYC, and yes we did have a bit of trouble figuring out the radiator but once we were shown how to work it we were fine.  They even gave us an extra heater to use because my wife was sick when we were there.  The Astor was the most affordable hotel we  found on Manhattan, and the location was plenty convenient for us.  The bus line right outside the front door takes you pretty much everywhere you could want to go and allows you to sight see at the same time, and if you want to go farther faster the subway is right up the street.  We had a blast in New York, though next time if we go in winter we'll bring even warmer clothes :).  The people at the Astor were nice, and the rooms;4
Just returned from a 4-night stay and had a pretty good experience.  Our priority was cleanliness, and the Astor did well on this front -- the renovation seems mostly complete, and our room was newly painted, bath was very clean, nice towels, sheets, and comforter (however, the paint was of the didn't-bother-to-remove-the-light-switch-covers variety, so it lacks aesthetic appeal).  The room was very, very small and did mean living out of suitcases on the floor (of which there was little).  We mostly wanted a clean place to sleep while we explored the city, thus we were statisfied.  (And, for what it's worth, we found the staff helpful, and friendly -- though we didn't have much need of them, so not many interactions to go on).  They did get us a non-smoking room.  We found the;4
Location, exceptionally clean - cleanest hostel I've ever stayed in. Very secure - great locking. Good showers. Fridge in room - terrific. The room was very clean as were the toilets and showers. The location is great, just a couple of minutes walk from hammersmith tube station.;4
"The character of this hotel is undeniable. A welcome change from the cookie cutter places out there. Loved the uniformed staff and the ambience. I appreciated my single bed very close to the bathroom and with a view of the Hudson. Drawback though was the ""jet engine"" hair dryers they use in the bathrooms. They can clearly be heard all night long as people dry their hands. Paper towels anyone ? Seems it would eliminate this problem not to mention keep in character with the hotel. Dimmers on the lights (nice touch). Appreciated the fan option and the hooks very smart. It was not clear the water was free. Didn't find out till now. A note would have been appreciated. Discovered bikes were free after I left also.";4
It was a nice hotel at a walking distance to Universal Studios. Unfortunately they are repairing their lifts and it took a while to get a lift. Staff was very courteous and room had a good view of the Universal Studio. We got free internet during our stay.  They gave us bottles of water when we checked in but housekeeping staff did not keep new bottles of water after refreshing the room.;4
"I arrived at New York Penn Station by train at about 9am on a weekday morning, and I was very pleased to find just how close the hotel was to the train station. Excellent location! Unfortunately, my room wasn't quite ready yet, but the very friendly staff member at the front desk was able to do a ""pre-check-in"" for me. She suggested I come back around noon, so I left my luggage at the bell desk and headed out. When I came back over lunch, the line was a little long at noon for check-in, so it took about 10 minutes of waiting before I was helped. Fortunately, I got to deal with the same person as earlier that morning (I wish I'd gotten her name!) who got me checked in right away.   I didn't get to see my room until later that night, but it was quite nice. On the small side, as";4
Great location, comfort and service.  Zuli and Helena at the front desk are supremely competent, and their smiles will make your day.;4
The rooms need to be updated. The suite we had the shower kept going from hot to cold. I would suggest having another sink and a microwave in the suites.;4
Extremely easy check-in and check-out. They even upgraded my room for me when I was checking in and were very accommodating to me as I have a s Service Dog that travels with me. Very nice rooms. The only thing I can find that I would change would be the bathroom lighting. Its VERY dim and low. A bit difficult to put on makeup. Great experience overall...;4
I went to NY on spring break last year and I saw all the terrible reviews online.  We didn't have a lot of money or familiarity with the City, but we heard this place was in a nice neighborhood and it was 100 bucks a night.  The room was clean with no bed bugs.  The bathroom was always empty and clean.  We missed our checkout time, but the staff really didn't care so we weren't charged a late fee.  For the price of this hotel, you're getting a clean place in a VERY nice neighborhood.  We went into this situation expecting a hellhole, so we brought sleeping bags and precautions but never used any of them.  My roommates said it was noisy at night, but I never heard anything.  If you plan on spending time out in the city and not a lot of time in your room, this is the place to;4
Great value for the price we paid.  Special included no hotel fee or internet fee.  For all in price of under $150 you cannot find this quality and location in NYC.  Rooms were very well decorated and done and nice size bathroom;4
Really nice large hotel.  The rooms are large and include a couch, washrooms are large, and lots of windows in the room.  It's right across the street from Universal Studios, it takes about 10 mins to walk there.  (safe walk)  Across the street from universal city walk too which has lots of restaurants and shops.  Parking is $24 a day for self park.  Would stay here again, very convenient to just walk to Universal Studios, than fight LA traffic.  On the way back my GPS was giving me an odd route to LAX.  The concierge sat down with me, showed me a better route, and printed a map for me.;4
The Jane gives a great first impression, with striking original decor and fixtures and friendly door and reception staff in period-style uniforms. Elevator is slow, but its old and that is to be expected.  rooms are tiny, but this is the way they were designed and is also advertised on their website somewhat clearly. Additionally, you're paying very little for a hotel room in a fairly nice part of Manhattan... don't expect five stars and huge rooms for less than about $250 a night!   The only issue we had was that there was loud banging periodically throughout the night, which appeared to be coming from the walls (weird, I know) and making its way into the room through the large vent... I am not certain what the story was there. It was annoying and woke me even though I slept;4
This hotel is in a great upper west side location.  Right across the street from the Lincoln Center and very close to several good restaurants and close enough to other good UWS restaurants and attractions.   We were happy to see that the lobby and mezzanine were redecorated.  Although the rooms are cozy (read small), if offers good value for the price.  And if you require more room book a deluxe king.;4
From the moment you enter you are greeted by staff and they will help direct you. Reservations was efficient and congenial. I was arriving late due to coming from a trade show directly but they had my reservation correct, room ready and all was well.  I was meeting a relative so I wanted to settle quickly. Found my room and it was surprisingly nicely done for the price of this midtown hotel. The place was entirely clean, not dusty, and no sign anyone else had been there. The housekeeping staff did a fine job. Everything was properly clean, folded, tucked, and set up for my stay.   I packed away my gear and headed out to dinner. I did want to report that their safes DO NOT hold more modern computers or widescreen ones. No matter what you do. Fortunately, I felt it was fairly safe;4
We spent 3 nights at the Empire Hotel.  It was a perfect place for the 4 of us: great art deco design, lots of restaurants and food stops nearby,  2 blocks from Central Park.  We really enjoyed the rooftop with it's spectacular view and red light sign.  The pool is very small, but after a day of walking around NYC, we were very happy to be able to jump in.;4
We arranged airport pick up and return for 20 euros. The Riad is unreachable by car and this is where the problems developed as the area is on the outskirts of the Medina, in an area where the locals can be quite intimidating to say the least. We were constantly pestered by men wanting to show us the way (even when we weren't lost) and always wanted money. One demanded money even though he had done nothing to help us and when we offered him a euro to get rid of him he demanded more. One small boy tried to take the wallet from my pocket. To go out in evening you need a member of staff to escort you to Sidi Ben Slimane, where you get the taxis. Sometimes the street lights go out and then you are potentially in big trouble.   The Riad itself is a sanctuary away from the unpleasant;4
Great location a short walk to central park, the metro and several good restaurants ,bad points, small bedroom and toilet I could not sit on the toilet without my knees touching the wall  the room d.i.y non filter coffee making  machine was a $3 dollar room charge for each paper cup  âouch â Staff and concierge where very helpful but there must be better hotels in the same vicinity with a reliable elevator.;4
If you want to stay in a beautiful area of NYC with shops, cafes, restaurants, bars and tourist attractions all close by and not pay the cities high prices then this is your hotel. Theyve done a wonderful job keeping the historic look and feel of this hotel intact and it just helps you fall in love with it even more. The survivors of the Titanic were brought here and you get a wonderful feeling of what how the hotel was back then. The captains cabins are a perfect size for a couple, the cafe down stairs does great food, rooftop is great for sunset drinks and the bar is happening all weekend. We loved the free bikes as the city is so flat (compared to Sydney) that its so easy to get around.   For those that are light sleepers be aware that the bar downstairs gets busy so a lot of;4
"The hotels location is perfect, everything is in walking distance. My room was nice and had great view. The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. The door man Luis was amazing. The hotel restaurant ""Tick Tock"" is great for late nights as it's always open.";4
The hotel was in a great location for site seeing. The rooms were clean. I wished there had been either coffee in the room to make, or coffee in the lobby for early departures. The bed wasn't that comfortable, and lumpy. The staff was very nice. We were not able to hook up to the WiFi in the room. The cost would be an extra $10.00 to do so, which wasn't a lot if it worked. Most hotels offer free WiFi these days. It was a comfortable stay.;4
Late review. I very much enjoyed my stay at The Jane Hotel. Room was clean. Shared bathrooms were also very clean. I am a single female, traveled alone and felt very safe. Every staff member I was in contact with was professional and helpful. I stayed five days, four nights and did not have any negative issues. The only reason I am not giving five stars is because the beds are a little uncomfortable. Other than needing better mattresses, this is the place to stay if you want to save money while in NYC.;4
Recently returned from a four night break at this hotel. Flew into Newark Airport and used the train to get to Penn Station. $13.00 ea, kids were $3.00 each. The hotel was just across the road from the station. Easy to get to.  We arrived just after 2pm and tried to check in, however our room wasnât ready, but no problem, the receptionist pointed us in the direction of a local pub, and gave us a 10% discount card. All good.   Went back at around 4pm. Was looked after by Mohammad. The room was still not ready. Mohammad swung into action, and with a couple of quick calls, we were sorted! Couldnât have asked for more!   To be honest, the floor we were on looked a bit tired, as did the rooms, but they were fine. (I get the impression that Wyndham are in the process of renovating it);4
Stayed for 7 nights for our first trip to NYC  and had a room on the 35th floor with a view out to the Hudson, which was great.The room was small but perfect for us with a lovely original bath and plenty of character, with great air con and really comfy bed and pillows. The hotel's location is perfect, right in the middle of Manhattan and right next to Penn station and subway.It  would be perfect if they would drop the facilities fee. Also I would not recommend the Tick Tock diner, over priced and over rated food!;4
My very first trip to America new york and have to say we really enjoyed our stay we Brita love our tea and down fall was you could only get a cup of tea in the morning and you had to go down to the lobby door men were brilliant desk people could be a bit more helpful had great sleep bed lovely views good all in all fantastic place;4
Oct 2004 - My husband and I were in LA for a wedding and the Sheraton Universal was recommended by the Groom. I looked here and saw that the reviews of the Sheraton were not so great so I chose the Hilton based on its reviews. I was happy I did.   It is not cheap nor is it a spectacular hotel for the price. We usually stay at much fancier hotels. The room was very clean and a good size with a small table and chairs and a seperate desk where my husband set up his laptop to connect to the internet. There was a fruit basket in the room with fresh fruit, water and cookies upon our arrival.  It was a quick 5 minute walk to City Walk and Universal. Hotel self-parking was very convenient. The valet staff was great as the held my car by the entrance if I was running back out. Concierge;4
we booked this hotel as we were wanting to see the universal studios.  The hotel is in its own grounds and a single tower block.  The car park, complimentary guests, is directly underground.  check in was pleasant and we had a corner room with great views.  The room was very clean, great quality bed and facilities (did I mention the view??).  Overall very modern hilton room.  The other hotel facilities were good, with a small kiosk for coffee/croissant in the morning.  There's a bar which doesn't have a great atmosphere as it's in the middle of the hotel atrium and is a little soulles although the staff again were very friendly and very efficient.  The downside and the reason this hotel didn't get full marks is because of the location.  This hotel is the closest to Universal;4
We arrived late on Sunday night and received a very friendly greeting at reception, as we had emailed ahead we were given  an upgrade to celebrate our wedding anniversary , we stayed in suite 3810 on the corner with wonderful views of the city and the Hudson, the staff that we encountered were nothing but friendly and we even received a free bottle of champagne on our anniversary day a very nice gesture indeed. The New Yorker is close to most places including madison square gardens, Empire State and Times Square is a short walk away , port authority bus terminal is also a short 5 min walk away , subway station right across the road for easy access to all places. This hotel may need some tlc but itâs in a great location and reasonable priced for nyc, w also ate in the tick tock;4
"This is a period hotel in Greenwich Village near high line. Overall, atmosphere is a bit quirky (in a good way); the  staff's uniforms and lobby atmosphere are reminiscent of ""Grand Budapest Hotel."" We enjoyed our stay in one of the rooms w private bathroom. and were not aware of any noise from rooftop bar (bar upstairs is worth a visit: wonderful view from terrace!).";4
Hotel is in a great location and the rooms were fine as we didn't spend much time in them apart from sleeping.  Staff are really nice and the concierges were very pleasant and helpful. We ate in both the restaurant and the diner and food was excellent.;4
I would recommend staying at the New Yorker.  It is very clean and centrally located although the rooms are not spacious or fancy.  You do need to ask for such things as coffee maker and fridge for your room.;4
I stayed in this hotel for a holiday with 2 friends for 10 days between July and August 2018, the position is good there is a Metro station near and it's possible go to every part of the city. Breakfast is for every taste and plentiful and there is a cook for the eggs, but some morning missed bacon and other food. The room was very nice and wide and also the bathroom. Another positive aspect is the cleaning that was great. To sum up, i was fine in this hotel and i keep it in view if i will come back to Los Angeles.;4
Very Clean Hotel and great location to Universal Studios. Very convenient and walking distance. Restaurant prices and room service is a bit overpriced but, I guess you can expect that when on vacation.;4
I made my reservation through hotels.com I booked a metro room. When I arrived l asked to change the room but it wasn't possible till the next day, the front desk manager switched me to an amazing view room. The room has no fridge and no coffee maker it's upon request. The fridge costs 20$ per stay. Yet they offered it for free since I was staying for 9 nights. The only thing is that the carpets and the bed sheets need renovation, they are very old. I hope the management will consider renovating the carpets as they are not healthy for allergic people. Other than that I had an amazing stay and would come back again for sure.;4
I chose this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor, and at the time we reserved it it had an offer on the pricing  PROS: -FRIENDLY STAFF/ the whole staff was very friendly, especially gisel at the front desk, she helped me with directions every morning on our way out. -VERY CLEAN ROOMS AND BATHROOMS/ the cleaning staff did a great job in cleaning the rooms, especially the bathrooms which were very clean, and they provide you with complimentary toiletteries every day ( shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower cap and mouth wash) -QUIET ROOMS/ the hotel is very quiet and the isolation is super, you can't hear other guests or any weird sounds -SUPERB BREAKFAST/ one of my favorite things about this hotel is the breakfast buffet, so many things to chose from, they offer ( 10 types of;4
For a few years now I have been working with Michelene in the sales department at the Empire on rooms for our staff as producers of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York.  She has been so helpful in making sure we are taken care of and we know we will never have a problem when we are in her hands.  More recently I was assisted by Pasquale at the front desk and he was such a relief during such a stressful time!  He worked with us on getting our guests checked in even from a distance as it was impossible for us to get everyone there at the same time.  The team was and continues to be a pleasure to work with!;4
Booked directly through Hilton Honors (HH). Now, most hotels check-in by 3:00 pm, but we were to be guaranteed a 4:00 pm check-in through the HH program. We had requested an earlier check-in of 2:30 pm, but LA traffic messes with Garmin's ETA's and we arrive about 3:40 pm. Waited through the line and was told the room was not ready. Waited through the line again and, by 4:00 pm, the room was still not ready. I complained and were comp'ed with Breakfast Buffet ($56 value), so that made that feel a bit better. Still, we were tired and would have better liked to just go to our room, rest, and go to Universal. Room was beautiful, clean, and on the fourth floor, which has the advantage of also being the Mezzanine, which contains conference rooms and a second set of elevators that;4
Used my Wyndham points for two nights and purchased two more nights. Notified front desk at checkin and had a seamless transition between to two reservations, keeping the same room.   We found our room in excellent condition. Standard room was a bit small but not enough to disappoint since little time was spent in it.   New Yorker is perfectly positioned for the major sight seeing locations with the Empire State Building two blocks away and Madison Square Gardens across the street.   We look forward to another stay sometime in the future.;4
The New Yorker is a grand dame of a hotel - fantastic lobby with detail to satisfy the most ardent Art Deco lover. The hotel has some sort of museum downstairs to commemorate Tesla, who lived in the hotel for a period of 10 years.  The rooms are typical New York: old, smallish (compared to South African hotels) and with older bathrooms. Brown horrible carpets seem to be the norm in NYC and the New Yorker does not disappoint.  Great hotel though.Great location, with loads of shopping nearby. There was a ComicCon event around the corner so long lines snaked around the hotel, creating a fantastic sight.;4
"First off, I would like to say that it was top notch customer service. A lot of staff walking around ready to help you. When I needed amenities for the room, they took care of it right away. The check in was a bit of a wait, but not bad. Our room was quite spacious, compared to the average hotel room. We noticed the fridge was missing from the room, so I reported it and a fridge was brought up within minutes. Our room was also missing the advertised chair and ottoman, but I didn't realize this until after we got home.The only ""con"" I would have to say is that the bathtub, on the outside near the floor had a 7 inch thick scratch which was quite rusted and I'm surprised that maintenance didn't repair this prior to renting the room, (room #754). Jesse at the concierge desk was";4
"We stayed here due to an overnight layover on our way to Hawaii from the east coast.   The hotel is under a minute from the terminals at LAX and they provide a free shuttle which seemed to run very regularly.     ROOMS: clean, modern, and quiet.  I have stayed at other airport hotels and you always hear airplane noise.  We did not hear any here.     FOOD: There was quite the bar scene here, which was unexpected for an airport hotel.  We arrived late and just wanted to grab something small at the restaurant/cafe/bar area before heading to bed.   The prices are ridiculous.   A bagel was $5.  My husband got a sandwich which he described as ""edible"".     Since our stay was so brief and all we did was sleep, I cannot speak to quality of staff or amenities other than check in was";4
Went there for a weekend, the location is amazing, in the heart of NYC, for me being close to my training was great, the room was tiny, but not a bad view, it was clean and elegant, yes old but well maintained, if i ever needed to be in the same area, i will book the same room, price was reasonable for this crazy pricy area.;4
Great location, had personal touch as not a skyscraper hotel, staff pleasant and helpful. Shower large and powerful, bed linen changed daily and comfy large bed. Room was towards back of Hotel was a quiet, no traffic noise.;4
Great location - easy walk to the High LIne and to Bryant Park, NY City Library.  Guest room small but clean.  Able to open the windows which I love - fresh air is the best!  Super comfortable bed, good layout of room.  Bathroom - no walk in shower, but again, it was clean, and the shower head was great and the water hot.  Bathroom sink very small - nowhere to put make up bag.;4
We booked two rooms,  one double for $43.00 and a single for $28.00! We were very apprehensive because how can you get a room for that rate in NYC?  One of our friends asked if we were sure that wasn't the hourly rate :}.      So imagine our delight when we checked in and found that the doorman could not have been more helpful with the bags, the front desk check in was extremely friendly and another employee in the lobby helped as well.   We took the small elevator (but no smaller than many elevators in NYC in hotels that charge $300.00 per night) to the 6th floor.   The carpet in the hall was a bit worn but the hallway was freshly painted over brick with new room numbers and pictures in the hallway, giving it a very lofty, SOHO  feeling.  Our room as you can see was better than;4
This is a lovely hotel standing opposite a tree lined square where you can sit and drink coffee, have lunch or just people watch!  All their staff are professional, friendly and help to make your stay enjoyable -  they can also offer local info and tickets, taxis etc. There is a roof terrace and small pool but for me (an oldie!) it was too noisy (not heard with the hotel itself) as it was full of 20-somethings 'larking about'! The 2 rooms we had were very well kept, cleaned daily, quite (one on floor 3 and mine on floor 9),  and were a good size with air con, many have views over Lincoln Square - mine didn't but then I only slept there as I was too busy seeing New York! The hotel is ideally situated for all the sites in New York. Many within walking distance including Times;4
The Empire Hotel is a nicely located property just opposite Lincoln Center and very near Central Park. The service was good and everyone was very polite. The rooms were a good size (Deluxe King Room) although the bathroom was small and had a shower. The bar downstairs has a cocktail menu inspired by Gossip Girl and the bar on the roof has good views of skyscrapers and also good cocktails. Very recommendable!  The style was art deco and very comfortable, especially the bed! I will definitely recommend it.;4
Super clean, nice accommodations. Rooms are t gigantic but nice size. Only complaint - cable service is spotty. Nice pool area, spacious, comfy. Restaurant and bar closed due to covid so that was another âthingâ. Weâd stay again though;4
We spent five days in the Empire Hotel over my birthday early December 2011.   Fairly well serviced and superb Location  - we walked everywhere. Check in was easy, but room very small (on 4th floor at the back)  and we were disturbed by the noisy air conditioning/heating units - but the noise soon blended into the background.  What a fantastic shower!  Could have done with tea/coffee making facilities in the room (but I seriously doubt there would be room for them!).  Dont have a drink in the Lobby Bar - very expensive!!  Overall, a good stay which would be improved by a larger room.;4
Just did a quick 8hr overnight stay for an early morning flight the next morning. The shuttle comes around every 15-30min 24hrs a day from what I was told, but when we checked out at 5:15am the shuttle was conveniently there and we didnât have to wait at all. Got upgraded to a suite for being Globalist,  although we couldnât really enjoy it since all we needed was a clean bed to nap. Overall met our needs perfectly and would definitely stay here again if I needed an airport hotel by LAX.;4
Uptown hotel near subway. Within walking distance of central park.  Deli, banks, market and restaurants near by.  Hotel was clean.  Beds were comfortable.  Shower was hot and strong.  Hairdryers barely worked and elevators were very slow but if you're on a lower floor you can use the stairs. Check out was noon and we had no problem extending until 1pm.  Rates were reasonable and I would definitely stay again.;4
The hotel is accessible to train station/bus stop. You can buy food outside especially if you are a Filipino and missing the Filipino foods... there is a Filipino resto (point-point) which is near the hotel. The staff are accommoding... special mention to Ms. Cecile Eugenio who is always there to assist us with regards to places to visit and how to get there... shuttle services and other stuff. Good breakfast and internet connection. Will be back here if given a chance...;4
The hotel is well located for all of the main sites,and is on the doorstep of Central Park. I was a bit nervous about the hotel after reading some of the reviews but i feel the reviews did not do this hotel justice.We had a back room with no view,and i asked for a room with a view as it was our Anniversary,wether or not they had one we didnt get it!I pressume this was because we had a cheap package deal? The room was fine and well cleaned,ideal for what we needed and made a great base. We had a problem with the bathroom door as it locked us out but maintenence soon sorted it.The room service was great and the room was cleaned every day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone,there are some great restaurants around for all pallets and budgets. The only negatives for me was not;4
On a recent trip to attend the Metropolitan Opera, I stayed at the Empire Hotel.  I had not been there in over 25 years.  The property remains well-kept and clean.  I liked the design of the interior public spaces I saw. The hallway on my floor was very attractive and quiet, for the most part.  My room (a queen) was well-appointed, clean and neat.  The bed was excellent, affording me a great sleep.  I only took issue with the shower, which curiously did not have a door or a curtain.  A plexiglass panel half-covered the shower enclosure, the other half was open to the bathroom at large.  No matter how one stood in the shower, water invariably splashed out of the shower and on to the floor.  Consequently, the bath mat got soaked.  When I mentioned this to an agent at checkout, he;4
This is a great vacation snooze joint for those traveling on a tight budget. I was in room 3621 and I couldnât have asked for a better room. Mine had one of the most beautiful views of the city. The housekeeping team is incredible. They are doing the most.  Tip: ask for corner rooms with a view of the Rockefeller Center and Empire State Building. NB: I thought it could use mini bars in the rooms though;4
Stayed here for a recent surgical procedure to keep from having to sit in traffic for an early arrival and afterward. A much nicer hotel than you would expect in this area. Nice, courteous staff, clean rooms and common areas. We had a nice room with balcony overlooking the courtyard. There was a nice common balcony area on our floor. My husband said that breakfast was good. Good select of restaurants that deliver....had some great Italian food! Parking fee, but it was nice to have secure parking in that area. Will definitely stay here again.;4
The hotel is very close to the subway. Our luggage was securely kept. The only dissatisfaction came from the moist floor and the restroom, which required maintenance.;4
Gem of a facility in prime location.  We enjoyed the Empire and her charm.  The rooms are smaller (as expected in an earlier NYC hotel but, very well cared for,  Recommend avoiding the Rooftop Breakfast.  Not a god representation of the quality of this hotel.;4
Stayed at this place recently and really enjoyed it.  It's in a great location on 54th and within walking distance of some great restaurants, subway's attractions and pubs.  The room was great, very clean and comfortable, the staff were super helpful and there was a continental breakfast and a small lounge.  Overall great value for money.;4
This location is super convenient for a trip to Universal Studios. The staff here also were super friendly ( I should have written down some of the names of the ladies of the front desk.) We came in late on our 1st of 2 nights, and our only option was to order pizza from Pizza Hut which was was tasty and delivered to the hotel. We were a short walk to Universal Studios which was our only place we visited while here. A wax Robert Pattinson greeted in the lobby. Parking was self park and very easy.;4
Hubby and I spent five days/nights at Ameritania in August 2017, and we enjoyed our time there.  Pros 1) The bathroom was small but well appointed.  It had one of the best showers of any hotel we've visited.  The shampoo, shower gel, and soap were fantastic, too.  2) We enjoyed the location - 54th and Broadway.  We walked to both Broadway shows, restaurants, Central Park, and Columbus Circle.  There were plenty of subway stations to choose from, too.  3)  The room was small, as I would expect most hotel rooms are in NYC, but it had everything we needed after long days of sightseeing.   4) It was quiet.  We stayed on the 10th floor, away from Broadway and 54th.  We didn't have a spectacular view, but we did sleep well.   5)  All of the staff that we dealt with were polite and;4
Cannot beat location and overall accommodations if you are planning to visit Universal Studios.  Hotel food and beverage options are adequate and food quality generally good.  Hotel rooms are well appointed, spacious and clean.  The hotel is in need of some refurbishing in the public areas but for a short stay and vacation use hard to beat location to Universal Studios and City Walk. Staff is very helpful and courteous.;4
The Morningside Inn is located on 107th Street which is in upper Manhatten. There are 2 subway stations close to the hostel (about 4 blocks) The hostel has a small lobby in the basement where you get free wifi and a chance to buy something from a vending machine. Our room had one queen size bed and another sigle bed. We were only 2 people but there was room for another one. The room itself was pretty small for 3 persons. Just enough space to get to you bed. But it was all right since we only went there to sleep. The room even had an air condition and a small fridge. The showers on the floor were ok. I ended up showering in one down the floor instead in front of our room since it was cleaner and larger.;4
I visit NYC few times a year. When I can get expensive hotel for great deal I stay good one. But if tight budgets I choose here. I stayed captain, bank bed. I was so lucky I got captain it was upgraded. Nice size of room, mini bar, nice view. Some one mention no dryer. I thought so too but I found at cabinet drawer. Nice bath room amenities. Any way bank room. some one complain about temperature. Yes little warm and AC is very noisy but if using AC for all night you are too cold. Believe me I didnât stop AC to sleep I was wake up around3 am because too cold. also canât here any noise from next door. But weekend around entrance is terrible some times. Just wear it! Stuff are so friendly ( that is why I m choosing) bath room is always clean. But this time only 1 time shower donât;4
Upon checking in, there were quite a few people in front of us so it did take some time. When we got to the desk, we were greeted by Mohammed, who realised that my wife & I were on our honeymoon and moved us to a very nice room, room 839, at no extra charge and with a great view of the Empire State Building ( especially at night time ). Thank you Mohammed!  Staff at both Reception & The Information Desk were both helpful and informative. We attended Woodbury Common Shopping Outlet on our last day and we were able to buy tickets for the bus from Reception which was very helpful.  The rooms are functional and beds were comfortable but the only downside, and it may be stating the obvious, but as this hotel is such a central hotel which is handy to nearly all of the main areas in;4
Just what we needed for an inexpensive stay in LA. This hotel is within walkable distance to the Metro Red Line which takes you to Hollywood & Vine and Universal City. We got free breakfast every day of our stay. Comedy nights in the basement attracts a hipsterish crowd. Not in the prettiest of neighborhoods, but there is a good teriyaki place near the corner and a drug store if you need it to stock up on bottled water, etc. The front desk was super helpful and friendly.;4
I had been pretty skeptical of the place from the reviews on TripAdvisor but when my husband and I got there, it seemed fine. I understand where people were coming from with the location's environment but the parking is gated so I didn't feel concerned about our car. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff were very polite.   The room we stayed in was clean but a little small. The bathroom was nice and clean. The fact that the floors in the bedroom were made of a sort of plastic-like wood was nice if you were still wet and didn't want to walk on wet carpet afterwards.  And I had wanted to make sure that we stayed in a nice hotel for our honeymoon and I believe I found it with this hotel.  All in all, I'm certain my husband and I would stay here again!;4
After reading other reviews, I booked a twin, ensuite room for 2 weeks and was allocated room 101.  Great location to Hammersmith Tube and lots of buses.  Quiet (for London/big city), it was safe and clean (with towels changed every second day and room basically cleaned).  The room was always warm (i think with underfloor heating in the ensuite) so all in all, excellent value all around.   Staying in a twin room with ensuite, it seemed more like a budget hotel than a hostel.  Beds were comfy, the room was spacious with a small double wardrobe, hangers, bedside cabinet and one reading lamp.   As other reviewers have commented, even though there are two ovens, microwave, jug and wash up sink, the kitchen utensils, pots and pans are totally lacking so other than heating up;4
Absolutely loved this hotel the staff were always friendly in greeting you and helping when needed  The bar/lounge area was amazing I had my 'chuck bass' cocktail nightly and loved it! We had a two bed suite and the room itself was very nice as well as the amenities offered would not hesitate in staying again;4
I was surprised with this hostel, I got a private room and it came with a queen bed, the room was very clean like a good hotel. Good environment, quiet and with nice front desk person. No complains at all.;4
Family of 4 (2 adults & 2 children â 14 & 8yo). Just back from spending a week at the New Yorker Hotel, end of May/start of June. After reading a few of these reviews on Tripadvisor, we were unsure what to expect at this hotel. Fortunately, we had a great week here, and loved the vibe/location of the New Yorker. Check-in was very quick and we were in our room within 15minutes of arriving (approx. 3pm). I asked for an upgrade and managed to get a room with a great view towards Hudson Yards on the 25th floor. The room was very spacious, which was a great surprise after reading many reviews saying that the rooms were small. We had 2 windows, and plenty room for all of our suitcases to be left on the floor and still have loads of space left. The air-con worked really well,;4
We stayed couple nights in a Hollywood Hotel. We enjoyed complimentary breakfast and convienent location of the hotel. Staff was helpful and friendly, especially Angelica who helped us to check in. Overall we had very nice and relaxing stay. :);4
I stayed here in a suite with my two brothers, my sister-in-law and my mum for 5 days in the October holidays. Below are my scores out of 10 for each area considered important when staying at a hotel...  Staff - 6/10 The staff were not overly friendly but were efficient in their job. There were enough staff on the desk so you were never waiting too long.   Room - 6.5/10 The room was quite spacious, especially for NYC and we had a view stretching to Times Square. There was a fridge, an iron board, two TVs, a dining table and safe. The reason I give it 6.5 is because the room was quite outdated and the bathroom was not very clean upon arrival. There were hairs still in the bath and there were also cracks on the walls. It could do with redecorating but overall, a good room. Despite;4
Just returned from a 4 night stay here. After reading some horror stories I was a bit scared to check in. However, it was fine and I neednât have worried. Yes, itâs dated and yes the rooms are tiny but we didnât care about those things. It was literally a place to get our heads down after a busy day. We were barely there and it did the job. The location was absolutely spot on. Right opposite madison square garden and a 10 min walk (if that) from Times Square. We couldnât have been more pleased with the location. Itâs also a 2 minute walk from somewhere that does THE NICEST bagel. Itâs called âbest bagel and coffeeâ. It was so nice we visited more than once. I was worrying about charges on check in as well but as we booked through virgin our tax and fees were included, phew! We;4
It was the cheapest hotel available on the island, which made it worth going to. The location is about an hour walk to Time Square, so you'll probably want to take public transit  The room was clean, but plain.;4
I have visited L.A in August 2016 for a week and spent an enjoyable time in this hotel. The hotel is basic, however, it has all the required amenities and toiletries needed. Rooms were reasonably comfortable, clean, bathroom is spacious. staff are friendly. Breakfast exceed my expectation with many fruits and fresh omelette and pan cake. The hotel has a sauna room.  Wifi in room as well as in public area is free and the parking was chargeable but reasonable.;4
Booked a Universal view room. Great view of Hogwarts. Room was spacious. Elevators and restaurant were being upgraded so was slow and noisy (construction). Shuttle could be organized better (eg a waiting line on both ends) so that it's more first come first served. Some guests were not courteous. Family enjoyed the pool, though weather was breezy by early afternoon.;4
Really liked this hotel, it was in a great position between Times Square and Central Park. From arrival to check out all of the staff were friendly and very helpful especially Jeff who recommended a lovely Mexican restaurant and arranged a car to the airport for us. The check-in was simple and our allocated rooms were great. I had let the hotel know that our friends were celebrating their wedding anniversary and they had a card and a bottle of wine waiting in their room. It's little touches like this that make you want to go back. If we visit NY in the future I would definitely stay here again.;4
The is a solid 4 star hotel. I only stayed one night as we live an hour away and just wanted to visit friends over the weekend  and didn't want to drive back and forth 2 days in a row.  This hotel served our purposes perfectly. Comfortable, clean and a beautiful view of Lincoln center from our room.  Parking on street relatively easy.  My only complaint is coming from the suburbs we are used to quiet while we sleep. We were on floor 7 and it was a little noisy late (did not wake us up though)     If you are used to a city atmosphere it probably won't bother you.;4
Had a great stay here with family. The rooms are fantastic and the staff were extremely caring to ensure all our requests were met. The food also was delicious. We will most certainly stay here again soon;4
So central and ideal for seeing the city. Art deco decor. Fabulous size rooms. Found the staff helpful and friendly. On site cafe good for cafe type meals. Close to train station and hop on  hop off buses. Would stay ther again.;4
I stayed here for a convention, which was held downtown.  Since I didn't like the area around the convention center, I intentionally decided to book a hotel in Universal City area.  I'm glad I did.  The rooms are very nice, and the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very well prepared.  There was very little noise around the hotel, mainly because the building is rather removed from the main drag.  I had a wonderful view of the valley from my room.  The free shuttle to Universal Citywalk was very convenient.  I think this property would be perfect for someone who is visiting Universal City/Hollywood areas for leisure.  Only down-side, which was mainly my own fault, is that the transportation to downtown took a long time.  In retrospect, this is probably not the best choice for;4
Very handy location for Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, mid-town subway etc. Nice quality hotel. Not cheap, but what is in New York, so good if you don't mind spending a bit more for a better location.;4
"Should have taken a taxi up hill after departing the train. There is a free shuttle trailer thing but would've been difficult getting cases onboard. Hotel was pretty classy as expected. Nice pool area. Room was spacious and very nice. The view over LA was great; at night the ribbons of car lights on the freeway was amazing . .it never stopped. We had buffet breakfast, somewhat limited unless yu opted for upgrade. We ate in the hotel the first evening. . It was ok. Perfect location for Universal City Studio Park. Great fun with rides, eateries and some shops if you like all that. Also close to Warner Bros Studios - much more grown up affair- very very good. Staff were very helpful and pleasant.";4
Location, location, location-just across the street from the Metropolitan Opera, 20 minute walk to MOMA and the Broadway theaters.  Noisy but it's NYC.  Great breakfast, nice bar. I like the ambiance of the reception area.;4
This is a great place to stay if you are visiting Universal Studios.  It's a 5 minute walk. The rooms are spacious and continental breakfast lovely. I would have given it a 5 star but the rooms don't have wifi.;4
good value and centrally located for our needs. Rooms well maintained  and fast service when issues were encountered. Great lobby bar and rooftop facility although it was cold. Unfortunately could not use the pool;4
Our 2-bedroom apartment was as described, although maybe not quite as spacious.  Given the great location and the price, it was perfect for us (4 adults + 2children).  It was simply decorated but vey clean.  We were within a 5min walk of Central Park and there are a number of good family restaurants around the corner.;4
Excellent hotel,very close to. the Met and Erik(my son).very reasonably priced breakfast. Only disappointment. Is that they were unable to find my razor that I forgot. Very neat and tidy. Room.Personal at the.front desk exellent in giving service.;4
I have stayed in New York a few times with this hotel my personal favourite for the cost and location. The New Yorker has good security and is clean and tidy with friendly helpful staff. The hotel is about as good as you can get to a central location on a budget. The Empire State Building, Time Square are a couple of blocks away with Maddison Square Garden literally across the street. Great place to stay!;4
Going into the trip I knew from reviews that the rooms would be small and their would be fees for all food and drink (even coffee) in the room.   No problem - the room was just a pit stop!    Just beware.    The shampoo/soap, etc. were great quality!! and there was a blow dryer!.     The biggest surprise to us was how upscale and modern the bathroom was.   It was tiny, like the room, but had wonderful shower fixtures, sink and toilet :)).    Beware, there is only one door for the shower, so my items on the floor of the bathroom got wet.  Overall, the best part of the hotel is the LOCATION.   FAN.TAS.TIC location - can't be beat.   Add to that the reasonable price and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!;4
My sister and I have been staying at The New Yorker for about 10 years on our annual 3-day trip to the City.  We love the location, as we take the train in to Penn Station which is a short walk.  We pay a little extra for a metro view room because the rooms are larger.  Sometimes we even have two closets in addition to the two beds.  The checkin time is 4:00, so you normally need to check your luggage @$2 until you can get into your room.  We were fortunate on this trip that there was a room ready for us when we arrived at 1:00.  It was a Wednesday, so maybe there are more rooms ready for occupancy mid-week than on a weekend.  We just wish the bathroom had a shelf someplace for our toiletries.  There are no coffeepots in the rooms, but the Tick Tock Diner in the lobby offers a;4
Location was great room and facilities awesome ... very clean could not fault it ... will book again .  Room was great size bathrooms and facilities where fantastic could not ask for more .  So close to everything , Broadway, time square .;4
Great location!  Walking distance(about 5 minutes) to Universal Studios and City Walk.  Beds were comfortable.  Rooms were nice.  Hotel had many amenities, store, Starbucks and restaurant.  Friendly staff.  Ordered ice cream and room service was fast and polite.  Short drive to Holllywood.  Would stay here again!;4
Everything you would expect from a four star hotel. A bit on the pricey side but it will acclimate you for the living costs of LA.   The location is great, took a shuttle directly there from the airport. Waited about 10 min and got there in like 5-10 min. There is a BOA nearby if banking needs to be done and the hotel serves as a good base to explore DTLA.  The room was immaculately clean, and the simple modern decor made it a welcome retreat. The club lounge was cozy but quiet, providing a much needed rest for any weary traveler.   Overall, the hotel serves as a good resting spot and a transition point for those coming from abroad. Welcome to LA.;4
You can tell the hotel needs a face lift and is slightly outdated. Also, they will nickel and dime you for any additional thing you might need. However, the location is the main draw. I could walk to Universal Studios and City Walk within 5 minutes. The pool was nearly always empty (a plus to me!) and the costumer service was great!!;4
This is the most convenient airport hotel around...you can literally walk from terminal 1 to the Hyatt in under 5 minutes. Very hip, midcentury-modern feel renovation makes this a stylish place to stay. Cairo, the Regency Club host is possibly the best club host I have encountered at any brand.  A true superstar who makes every guest feel special.  One down note...one of the biggest reasons I stay here is that the food in the Regency Club was so good that I never had to eat dinner or breakfast out. That made it worth it for me to stay here even though most of my business meetings are in Long Beach and Orange County...30 min to an hour away.  However, the Hyatt has recently cut way back on the food service at the club and in the evening, instead of two hot dishes and a soup plus;4
Taking into account the NYC standards, I believe this hotel, though expensive, is not a bad choice at all, due to its excellent Midtown location, its rooms larger than usual, the modern furnishings and flawless service. The rooms on the courtyard are not too noisy, despite the air conditioning. Food is below average, though, you will need to go out for a reasonable meal. Wi-fi is not free, except in the lobby, which is where everybody is crammed in the evenings to connect...;4
Good location, just up from Times Square. Rooms were clean and serviced every day. Bed comfortable.  A couple of negatives - there werenât any free plug sockets for charging phones etc except in the bathroom so not ideal. Also, no coffee or tea making facilities. I know this is probably a British thing but it would have been nice to have hot water to make a drink first thing. They did had hot water in the reception but obviously you had to get dressed. Anyway, a minor thing.  Overall, we were pleased with the hotel and staff. We had a problem with the safe not locking and it replaced within 15 minutes.  The Cascade deli/cafe just at the corner of 54th/8th street was great. We went in everyday for coffee and breakfast. Really reasonable.   Would definitely recommend this hotel as;4
I am extremely picky about where I stay. This hotel was perfect. It was clean, the staff was friendly, and we were well satisfied. Only downfall was that the elevators were being worked on. However, the staff was aware and helped the situation at all times.;4
This is the best location if you are going to the Lincoln center. In winter you get the best deals but NY is too cold during winter months.  Having stayed there several years back I see great improvements in this hotel. The staff are very nice and helpful.;4
All of the top quality amenities that you expect from Hilton. Very pleasant staff.  Frequent shuttle to Universal Studios.  Comfortable room, clean and quiet.  Very good breakfast buffet.  i would stay again.;4
Value for money, great location, friendly hotel.  No complimentary wifi or coffee which is a shame.  It's just inside upper Manhattan which is great, near Columbus Circle, Central Park and not too far to walk to time square 20 minutes.;4
We stayed at the Hilton LA on April 20. It was our first stay ever in a Hilton hotel. We chose this hotel because of the close proximity to Universal Studios. Though a shuttle is offered, we made the 5-minute walk. Our room was clean. The fruit basket was well appreciated. We had a view of the 101 freeway and partial view of the golf course. Next time, I'll have to remember to request a view of Universal Studios. My only complaints is regarding the cost for self-parking ($17) and the breakfast buffet ($20pp). In addition to that, the hotel charges $9.95 for internet, which all hotels should include as a free service. Other than that, we'll likely stay here again when we return to Universal Studios this time with the kids.;4
Tiny rooms, but it is close to public transportation and lots of restaurants.  Just across the highway from Hudson River Park. Great to jog or walk along the river. Helpful and efficient front desk staff.;4
It always depends on the rate? If you get a good deal, you try not to pay so much attention to the detail,  It's great hotel, but needs some good cleaning ( ex curtains) and renovating the rooms, great breakfast Good staff,  For the price we stayed I would definitely come back, but I would never pay 200-300$ for this hotel Parking is really expensive, I tried to park the car on the street but it a headache;4
Hotel was clean and modern and more than sufficient for a single night stay before our travel out.  We had a late check in, around 10pm, and the club lounge was already closed.  (It states on the hotel website that it's open 24 hours....) They had a sign up that said it would open for breakfast at 6 am...  Since our family had an early flight out, we came by around 6:30am to the lounge to get some quick breakfast....was STILL closed.  After sending off my family on their morning flight, I came back around 9am, at which time the lounge was finally open.  Food was mediocre all around and everything about it just left a bad taste.  First, if you bill yourself as an airport hotel, you know time and punctuality is key.  Overall, the hotel was fine and I would probably stay again in;4
The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly. Parking is gated which was a plus and costs $26 a day. The room was outdated with visible issues (see pics), but nothing that interfered with the stay, and the mattress was very hard. The location is about 12 minutes from Hollywood & Highland.;4
Location is great.  Subway access was just across the street and hotel is also close to theater district.  Restaurant in lobby is good.  The room itself was a good size but the furnishings need to be refreshed.  Staff members were very friendly and helpful.;4
I stayed at the Empire Hotel for a weekend visit with my two children to see Hamilton and enjoy the city.  The Empire's location allows for easy access to the subway at Columbus Circle to get anywhere in the city, and right near the hotel is PJ Clarke's, Rosa Mexicano right around the corner, and the rooftop bar in the hotel. The Junior Suite was roomy enough for me and my two adult children, was clean and comfortable.  The hotel was very responsive when the heatier was making a hissing sound.  An engineer came up to check it out and I received a follow up call to be sure everything was satisfactory.  I will definitely stay here again.;4
I had a great time at The Jane Hotel! Located in the cultural hub of the MePa district and a short stroll into Chelsea and Grenwich Village, there was always something happening in this exciting part of NYC. Although a little far away from the nearest subway stop and even buses, there is so much to see as you walk there, you hardley notice. Staff are friendly and the rooms always clean. Be warned, as everyone has mentioned, the rooms are tiny, and if your the sort of person who likes to spread your things out then you may want to opt for one of the larger rooms or another hotel. My experiance here was the best that I had in NYC and I will definently recommend this to any single traveller!  Thank You Jane Hotel!!!;4
The hotel was great,  nice clean and friendly staff.  I had some later meeting so I was working from my room. The Cleaning staff asked what time would be good for me so they could come back and not inconvenience me.  Prior to that,  @NIck at the the front desk totally rocked.  Got my room all put together,  helped with dinner and travel plans.;4
My husband and I stayed one night because we were leaving on a week-long cruise the following day. We took Amtrak to Penn Station and pulled our luggage one block to the hotel. It is beautiful and grand. An old, historic hotel that has/is renovated and updated. Still has some scaffolding outside.  At check-in there was a line of people waiting and when it was our turn the young lady checked us in and gave us our key card pretty efficiently. We had a confirmation for a Metro Queen room. We did not realize until the next day that we had been given a different room than we had reserved. Turn out we were in an Executive Queen which is much smaller than a Metro Queen because it is meant for a business traveler who is likely traveling alone. When we got to the room we opened the door;4
Lovely quaint hotel. Great location at the end of the High Line and close to everything in the West Village. One of those rare NY places where the old has been preserved and celebrated. Lovely room, great shower, the only real downside was the traffic noise from 11 Ave. It interfered with our sleep. Make sure your room is at the back. Recommend the wafels and the espresso too in their restaurant The Rose.;4
Excellent...the remodeling and fresh look throughout the hotel is impressive I have witnessed the changes Ad love the, especially the roof top bar. Wow what an amazing change Now we Ed a decent rest at the Empire;4
I needed a room close to Penn for an early morning train and wasnât expecting much.  My expectations were far exceeded.  I was in a beautiful room, recently renovated, with two beds, a sitting alcove and a beautiful, albeit small, bathroom.  The room had lovely Art Deco touches, including light fixtures and modern furniture that nonetheless harkened back to the Decoâs heyday. The hallway is a tad bit shopworn (particularly the carpets) but overall, a very positive experience.;4
We stayed at the hotel for a week.  The location is wonderful.  Internet was great.  Housekeeping was fabulous.  The air condition may need an upgrade soon but overall, I would recommend the hotel and will stay there again.;4
We were attracted to the location and price. The room with two double beds had recently been renovated. The concierge was most helpful and gave good directions to find our way around New York. We walked a lot and used the subway and buses. there was a view from our window overlooking Central Park. We all agreed that if we returned to New York, we would stay there again.We have already recommended this private hotel to friends.;4
Having lived in the upper west side a few years ago we decided to stay in a hotel in the same area. The location was perfect. Right next to the Lincoln centre, Columbus circle and central park. We walked everywhere when we stayed here apart from Battery Park. Only 20min walk to the top of the rock and Times Square. About 35 mins to empire state building. Lots of nice restaurants nearby would recommend Rosa Mexicana which is just round the corner.  Room and bathroom were small but stylish. Unlike others we found there was enough room for wash bags etc. despite being two girls with an awful lot of make up! Wi-Fi is not free in the bedroom although we were at one point given an access code which allowed us to connect for free when we really needed to. This was a nice touch and much;4
"This is very nice hotel with a great location. Walking distance to Time Square; Rockefeller Center; Central Park; 5th  Ave; etc. Staff were very pleasant and accommodating. Rooms are on the smaller side, but so are almost all average hotel rooms in NYC.";4
Comfortable beds. Customer service at front desk is excellent. The closest hotel to universal studios. 5 minute walk to the entrance. They also provide free shuttle to universal studios. It runs every 15 minutes.;4
Location is great yes it could use a little sprucing but the people working there are great The desk the front door  the  maids etc were all great very considerate  helpful.I would  definitely stay there again;4
Location was great and the office personnel made us feel like family. Thanks folks! The rooms aren't spacious and full of amenities we don't need, but we didn't come to NYC to sit in our room! The people at the front desk always led us in the right direction to explore this section of the city!;4
Even being one of New York's older Hotels, our stay was fabulous and very clean. The beds were above what we expected and even a refrigerator that actually cooled well. Three great restaurants on site and one is even open 24hrs a day. I will defiantly stay here again!;4
Staff very helpful, rooms average but good value for 3 star, worth upgrading to superior room. Near Central Park but north of centre of activity (Time Square etc.) but right next to Metro Station and bus routes. No eating facilities but couple of good restaurants opposite.;4
I stayed here end of September for about a week. It was a surprise holiday for my girlfiend and I - I proposed to here in New York! Overall, we were both extemely impressed with the hotel and finisings. The staff are great and the guy on concierge a legend. The location if fantastic, close to Lincoln Centre subway or Columbus Circle - a boon of a location.   A couple of points to make. When I made the reservation I wrote a note saying I will be proposing and it would be nice if the hotel guys could do something nice for us which didn't seem to happen. Perhaps some roses or chocolates would be great. I'm sure they would have if I asked in person but just keep an eye on the reservation footnotes please.   Secondly, the room we had seemed to have one of he first air conditioners;4
Location and roof top bar are the great points about this hotel. It does require a make over in particular the elevators which are very slow but I hear they are dealing with this. The pool deck which is for guests only has a great view, the pool is small but to be expected as it was obviously installed after the hotel was built. My pet hat however is the 20% service charge added and the the bill saying gratuity ......... Rather than additional gratuity.......... I do think all locations should be banned from doing this as I for one after a few beers forget to double check. Good hotel other than that.;4
After moving our daughter to LA, we stayed and played for a few days at the Hollywood...The GREAT.  Loved the location wrt proximity to what we did...easy (well as easy as it can get with LA traffic) to get to places like the zoo or the observatory, etc.  Loved the hotel set-up...nice sized rooms, clean, pool is wonderful and in its own little semi-private court-yard...you forget its next to the parking lot.  Our room was second story overlooking the street, but still quiet enough for sleeping.  I'm thinking the rooms overlooking the inner courtyard are even better, and that's what we will request next time.  The morning breakfast is fab, as it includes 'eggs made to order' and Special shout-out to Sonia!!!! who was wonderful fixing my omelet just how I wanted every day, but;4
We had an very good stay at the New Yorker.  It was a very active venue.  Helpful, too, to have a restaurant on premises.  Check in was smooth, room itself was a little small but of that vintage.;4
Friendly front desk staff help offset the length of time it takes to grab an elevator! Seems to be a favourite of school tours, so the lobby is usually quite busy. Our room, albeit small was very clean and the shower was fabulous. A great location for Times Square and the theatre district. Thereâs a Starbucks across the street if you prefer over the hotel breakfast (which we didnât partake of) Have stayed here twice and will probably go again.;4
We stayed at this Hilton a few years ago and loved the location, spacious rooms and Hotel facilities so we decided to stay again on our return to the US.When we checked into our room the first thing we noticed was that the floor had not been vacuumed from the previous guests - this immediately gives the guest a rather sour taste in their mouth!! The issue was reported to Front Office who arranged for Housekeeping to go and vacuum the room.Our room overlooked the 101 Freeway which was ok for a short stay but on our previous visit we had a room that looked over Universal Studios which was a much nicer outlook.  As a family we don't tend to spend alot of time in the room so we normally select Hotels for their location and proximity to major attractions. This Hotel provides the;4
"You feel like a rock star at the Jane, and we had own own terrasse. Love the flamboyant Hendrix-like style of the rooms; coxy and sexy. Nothing too luxurious, but a good vibe. The breakfast room has great organic food, although the coffee is to weak (;-), and the bar is a pretty cool. Walking distance from everything. Big love.";4
Booked a 5 night stay as we wanted to be somewhere close to LA. Found this for $850 dollars for 5 nights.  Positives - Great location. Metro 2 minutes away which will take you most places. - Good choice of food etc around. Wendy's, Pizza Hut etc all within a 5 minute walk. - Room was huge. Checked in room 136 (suite) has a giant hot tub, lounge, bar area. - Breakfast, Hugo is great making us waffles and eggs in the morning. Good choice of bread, pastries, couple of hot items, fruit etc. Perfect way to start my day and often skipped lunch due to still feeling full. - It is a very nice looking hotel, the steps in the back are really nice and great for photos.  Negatives - The air conditioning. Set to the lowest temperature and it is pretty useless, they even provide 2 tower fans;4
Great, location, clean hotel, good be more modern, stayed in a suite which was nice. Lifts often smelt of weed! but i guess you cant stop this from happening.  Tick Tock diner below, mcdonalds and taco bell opposite.  We wanted a kettle/coffee machine in our room, they charge $25.00/day. so we purchased a kettle for $10.00, to use during our stay.;4
Stayed here on leisure for my first visit to New York. Personally I loved the location of this hotel, it has the residential feel over tourist. Right opp central park literally 5 metres from the hotel, there are 2 subways within a 5 min walk from the hotel and takes just minutes to all the attractions the city has to offer. If you are looking for a central location this isn't for you, I loved the peace and quiet of the location.  The hotel is very small, the lift is tiny but certainly not worth knocking any points off. The rooms are very basic but clean and comfortable. The staff at the hotel were amazing, polite, helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them.  To summarize........if you are looking for a modern, spacious central location book somewhere else, what this hotel;4
Stayed here for a night-over after going to Universal Horror Nights. Parking was a bit difficult to find, but once I was on the Hilton property the signs led me to the self parking underground lot. It was also difficult to identify which floor the lobby was on. In the stairwell there were signs on the doors, but they didn't really make sense.  The hotel has a large lobby floor with bar area, made-to-order sushi station and restaurant. The front desk did not mention if I had complimentary in-room wireless (I usually have it) and I forgot to ask. The room was very nice and clean. Very comfortable bed and pillows. The TV remote was a bit tacky and some of the channels didn't come in very well (digitally broken up), but we weren't there to watch too much TV anyway.  The air;4
"We were there for a wedding. Stayed in an ""alcove king"" with a nice view down the valley. They room was excellent and obviously had benefited from a more recent remodel then the lobby and other areas in the hotel. Clean and large, I would recommend the room.";4
excellent location, clean room. helpful hotel staff. BUT hotel's Tick Tock coffee shop is a disaster because there aren't nearly enough wait staff to handle the job. So orders get screwed up and no one is available to fix the problems.;4
It was my 3rd stay at this hotel, reason I keep choosing it is that it is strategically located making it easy to travel by subway. Just outside the hotel you could jump on lines A, C & E which by the way also connects to JFK airport. At walking distance you can reach almost all the other subway lines which is a good advantage whether you are in NYC for business or leisure reason.  Times Sq., Macys and Empire State Building are amongst some of the places at walking distance. Tick Tock Diner offers good food and friendly staff. We didn't have any problem with waiting time for the lifts, and all staff is friendly. Hotel though needs refurbishment, mattresses in our room were quite bad and windows fails to isolate you from noise and cold, but I understand that is already;4
Stayed here for the second time. First time was 5 years ago. Still loved it!   The room was and had a a view. The staff is really nice and helpfull. Next time when I visit NY, I will defenitly stay at this hotel;4
Upon arrival, Mr. Ze was very helpful with check in. Once he noticed I was traveling with children, he upgraded our rooms to get them close together. We found the rooms to be very clean and well stocked. We will be very comfortable here!;4
The hotel is ideally placed for Central Park and Times Square with also the yellow, blue and red subway lines just a street or two away. Wifi is poor (only lobby connection is free and that is rather sporadic depending on how many people are using it), however there is a free NYC wifi on the street just outside the door and there is a Starbucks nearby too. Room was nice although the air conditioning unit was very noisy. (Tip: take earplugs as the traffic noise is throughout the night including car horns and sirens) Bathroom was very good and nice sized but the minibar, tray of snacks and the water bottles are extortionately priced.  A nice hotel to be based from when sightseeing.;4
"Stayed for three nights with my two teenage daughters in a suite  (two rooms, one with two double beds, one room with a pull out sofa double bed).  Each room had own bathroom, wardrobe storage and tv.   Tea/coffee making facilities not present, but willingly brought FOC on request.   Room was on one of the higher floors, but overlooked other rooms so no city view to speak of.  Decor drab, brown and in need of a facelift but as only used for sleeping was not an issue for us.  Had to request extra bedding for third bed as not prepared (despite booking as three occupants).  Room was clean but not sparkling as decor so tired and brown! And it smelled musty......  Breakfast taken in Tick Tock diner on ground floor; excellent.  Superb location for shopping and sightseeing and always";4
We stayed just for one night, to see a show at the Greek Theater, and found it absolutely perfect for that purpose. The hotel is lovely, it has lots of charm & character and what is surely the single best free breakfast buffet I've ever had at a hotel. It's huge! Omelettes, waffles, you name it! If you're looking for a hotel that is not just a bland, generic cookie-cutter place, try this. It's nicely landscaped, rooms are quite comfortable, there's a gift shop & a pool. We watched the staff interact with foreign tourists & found them to be courteous & helpful. No complaints at all. Really nice place, lovely, full of personality.;4
This is all you need in NYC, we were travelling with a young baby so being in Manhattan was more convenient for us. We got a super good deal and didn't expect much from this place. Let me tell you I was wrong, from the time we pulled up in front of the Hotel to the staff at the reception, the whole experience was great. They have been super accomodating, trying to help us find free parking on the street (I had already booked an inside parking not too far from there) for the 3 days but did appreciate the offer to help. They switched us to a King size bed without us having to ask as they noticed the baby would be sleeping with us. The rooms are small but very convenient, anyway we spend most of our time outside visiting the city Sheets and bathroom were clean, I had nothing to;4
The location is wonderful near Lincoln Center.  The lobby is beautiful, and staff is very helpful.   The rooms are super small and the bathrooms are even smaller.   The bathroom needed some attention with caulking and the door was warped from the moisture in the bathroom.  Otherwise, everything was great!  I would definitely stay there again.;4
I booked this hotel through a name-your-own-price site for under $90 a night. And for that price, I consider this hotel perfectly adequate. It' standard chain hotel fare: efficient, reasonably clean and with all the basic amenities (and then some). The biggest plus: this is as close as you can get to LAX - it's a mere 5 minute shuttle ride, and the shuttles run frequently. Check-in was efficient and friendly. The room was modern and, just like the entire hotel, recently renovated. But the quality of the workmanship is quite shoddy in some places. There was some wallpaper coming off the wall, and the electric outlet next to the bed was loose (with the wiring visible behind the plate) - not good and probably not safe. Overall, I feel I definitely got my $90 worth... but I would;4
Friendly and helpful staff in reception. Free wifi very fast. Good location near Red Line Metro stations Vermont/Santa Monica and Vermont/Sunset. Happy with a room facing the courtyard. Wouldn't want one facing Vermont, very busy street. Parking costs $20 per day, plenty of space during our stay. Room clean and spacious. Breakfast was alright. Only complaint was a very grumpy busboy and in general they didn't smile a lot in the restaurant.;4
"Great location â across the street from Lincoln Center.    This hotel has to be seen to be believed.  To quote from Wikipedia (which doesnât do it justice):  âThe design and dÃ©cor of the Empire Hotel is a classic, neutral palette of ochre, coffee, cream and caramel, and is accented by hand-crafted metalwork such as hammered bronze, brass and copper. All furnishings and fittings were custom designed for the Empire Hotel, making it truly one of a kind.""  That's an understatement!!!    If you want to get away from the monotony of everyday life, as well as enjoy a performance at Lincoln Center, this is the place to go!";4
Being so close to Lincoln Center was a great plus and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The corridors and rooms are a little dark but overall I would say this is a perfect place to stay on the upper west side.;4
Stayed here for 3 nights on route 1 from San Francisco before heading to Las Vegas. Big hotel very very busy but superbly located and appointed. Rooms have thin walls and we were disturbed the first night by noisy guests after midnight who seemed like they were in our room. The hotel dealt with it efficiently and although unable to move us as they were full I think security had a word and the noise died down. The day before we left I heard someone opening their room safe. Perhaps it was because the room we had did have an adjoining door which didn't help with the sound.  We were on floor 21 executive floor but didn't pay extra for a park view, we were glad, the other rooms overlook the Hollywood hills where we toured round the stars houses and were more interesting. The full;4
We stayed here on March 28-29 and had a fabulous time. The hotel is literally steps away from Universal Studios and City Walk. Our room was a double and was quite spacious on the 5th floor. The room was able to accommodate 7 ( I know over capacity but I could only get one room at the rate I had) with the use of inflatable mattresses. The room was clean and quite. The only improvement I could have asked for was a better view (we could see the top of the building but still had a bit of a view). I would highly recommend this hotel for those planning a few days at the park.;4
Needed a one night stay in Manhattan this past December.  Picked up an international traveler arriving at JFK and then wanted to see the museums the next day. We thought about the Bronx since we had our own car but then decided to try this place on the Upper West Side of the Park because well, it's the Upper West Side.   It was very cold and rainy this particular weekend but the hotel was comfortable.  The rooms were cool but not freezing just not super cozy either.  We were brought a room heater for each of our rooms and these were brought quite quickly when we asked for them.  The rooms were clean, the beds decent, and the bathroom had good hot water and pressure. The desk staff are no nonsense but not rude.  The thing to know about this place is that it is an old NYC;4
A small hotel situated out the way of the hustle and bustle of the city which is nice to escape from (about 5-10 minute walk from Times Square)  The room was ok, a little small and lacked storage for clothes and other things we get in other hotels we have stayed. The air con unit near the window was rather loud and the surrounding wood was starting to rot with paint peeling. But, the room served a purpose and the shower was fabulous!  The rooftop bar isnât worth a visit as when walking in, the staff make you feel as though you are inconveniencing them and were not at all welcoming. At one point, we were sat having a drink admiring the view when a rather rude lady who had a miserable face approached us to ask if we were staying. When we said âyesâ she huffed off and proceeded to;4
Great size rooms with comfortable beds. Fantastic location for Universal Studios and Universal City walk. Close to metro station if you want to head down to Hollywood Boulevard. Friendly staff. Only negative thing is that its hard to wheel your bags on the thick carpet floors at reception.;4
Arrived from London and Mr. Ze checked us in very efficiently and professionally. He made us feel very welcome and cared for!!!!!! Our Junior Suite is great for my family and has great views!!! Nice Bathroom and very comfortable pull out couch for my son.;4
My family recently stayed her during the busy holiday season. This hotel has an older feel to it, you can tell it is a classic building but this should not be confused with being run down.  We drove into the city this time so we parked our car in front of the hotel to unload. The doorman will give you a check for your car and park it in a garage. Be sure to take everything you want at that time, there are no in and out priledges. Check in was easy. Once you have your keys, you do need to show them to get past an employee stationed by the elevators. There is also a concierge in the lobby as well as bellstaff.  Although some people say the rooms are small, our party of 3 stayed in room 2560 and it was not small for a NYC hotel room. It had a walk in closet with a safe, a smaller;4
We used this hotel due to the convenience to the airport.  Also, close to Manhattan Beach where we spent a day.  We are also staying at this hotel again for overnight stay before we fly home the next day after an overseas flight.;4
This hotel is perfectly located close to MSG and Penn Station. ItÂ´s a perfect stay for a weekend trip in NYC. For us it was nice to stay at a hotel close to Penn Station since we landed and flew from Newark Liberty International Airport. There are trains going between the airport and Penn Station so you donÂ´t have to take a taxi if you stay at this hotel. However the standard at the hotel is mediocre, the service is good, but the rooms are just OK, not more than that.;4
Excellent location and an absolutely huge room, this was a very convenient spot to stay the night before a meeting in Waterloo. There was a bit of noise from outside but once my trusty earplugs had been shoved in, all was well. The breakfast was fine and most of the staff were quite friendly. Check in was a bit slow and neither of the self service kiosks was working. All in all though, I slept well and would stay again.;4
The room was very clean and the people at the front desk were very nice and helpful.  It was a good location for going to the Rose Bowl Parade.  They have a good continental breakfast in the mornings.  The rooms need better lighting.  A couple more lamps in the rooms would be very helpful.  Also, the counter in the bathroom is quite small.  I would definitely come back to this hotel again.  We really had and enjoyable trip.;4
Well what can I say about the Hilton Hotel Universal City. The staff were fantastic and accommodating and really helpful. Shout out to Danny I from concierge, always going the extra mile. The girls by the pool, were amazing, made awesome cocktails.   Accomodation The bedroom was clean, the bed, although they sell them as Queen, are actually double beds, in the rest of the world. But they were very comfortable, thank god. The rooms well kept clean and tidy be house keeping.  The Hotel is pretty out dated and definitely needs a good make over. Need more food selection, very limited and very expensive. But seafood buffet on Saturday nights is nice.  The Instore Jeweller Mario, is a legend and makes and sells some very nice pieces of jewellery. Recommend seeing him.  The swimming;4
The Empire Hotel's rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished, despite the fact that the building is old.  They have done a wonderful job of modernizing the lobby with a great bar and the restaurant/lounge on the rooftop offers a great view of the city.  The bathrooms are a little small but you have everything you need and the shower is wonderful!  The staff is very accommodating and I was checked in by Jeffrey, who is polite, friendly, very helpful and remembered me from prior visits.  I was in room 1016 with a great view of Lincoln Center, one of my favorite parts of the city.;4
Well priced hotel booked through Hotwire - it is not directly in the city centre, but a quick cab ride into times square and nearby to a metro stop.  Was directly across from Central Park which was nice...rooms are very basic, but for us (3 girls in their mid 20's) it was perfect as we were not there to spend time in the hotel.  Bathroom was clean enough....elevator was SLOW.  There are stairs, but with all your baggage you likely will have to use the elevator.  Staff was extremely friendly, open to offering dinner suggestions etc.  For the value, this was a good hotel.;4
Overall the hotel is great. The location is perfect for visiting universal park and the city walk. We spent one day at each, I felt it was worth paying for the more expensive ticket to avoid waiting in lines at universal. Vacation time is too costly to spend it standing in line. The hotel is having some trouble with the elevators, but it was not a big problem. I had to wait about 2 minutes a couple of times.;4
Excellent position near to Times Square and Central Park. Door staff very helpful and knowledgable, receptionist very welcoming. Bedroom clean with comfortable beds. Overall the hotel is a bit dated but given that we were out all day it served its purpose. Shame no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Room was very noisy at night with Road works outside.;4
This being our first visit to New York we were guided by our travel agent on choice of hotel.  The Hotel was on a room only basis which suited us as we were only there for 3nights and intended to make the most of our first visit to the Big Apple.  First impression in the reception area was favourable with a busy reception area watched over by the ever watchful security guys on the main door who were always friendly and on hand to  help with baggage and parcels and who made us feel welcome every time we entered or left the Hotel.  The reception staff where really good and made checking in and out very easy and always had a smile for you  Being new to New York we did not know our way around but Chris the concierge soon made us welcome and gave detailed directions to the places we;4
Lovely hotel, great location, fantastic staff. Only issue was the pool being closed and not being told in advance. It was one of the reasons for booking the hotel so disappointing. We got to use the Sheraton pool but not as nice or convenient.;4
If you are going to Universal City in Los Angeles, this is the place to stay!! Walking distance to everything. Typical Hilton rooms and resturants. You are choosing to stay here for location, location, location. Enjoy your visit.;4
I love this hotel because it's ideally situated next to the London Eye, everything is withing walkable distance. I have stayed at the Premier Inn County Hall on numerous occasions before Covid and my first impression upon coming back was: it had suffered from the pandemia as they put me into an old room where you had dust ribbons on the edges of the carpet and with a view onto a wall. As I was staying for a whole week I asked to get another room with a better view. What a change: This time it was a newly refurbished room giving on Belvedere - I know I was lucky to get this one as they are usually reserved for families. But it reassured me to know that Premier Inn are trying to keep their standards (they are actually renovating the hotel but I didn't hear any of the works). My;4
Stayed for 4 nights and cannot grumble about a thing.Helpful and courteous staff the receptionists where excellent.We stayed on the 3rd floor and apart from the emergency vehicles didn't hear any outside noise.room was spacious enough bathroom very good.i wasn't in New York to stay in my hotel but along with been conveniently positioned I have no complaints what so ever.;4
Room 2026 a little tight when two people trying to get dressed. Bed very comfy. Great shower with lots of hot water. Noisy at night from outside, window wasnât very sound proof. Central location.  Tick tick diner good value, extensive menu.;4
Well located right next to Universal Studios. Just a short 10 min walk or take the free shuttle. Rooms are a reasonable size for a family with young kids. The pool is average but you're not there for the pool. The buffet dinner was great and you have other options up at Universal Walk. If heading into Hollywood it's just one or two stops on the Metro at the bottom of the hill.;4
We stayed for 10 nights in June. And loved every minute. The hotel is in a great location, only a 10 min walk to Times Square and is really beautiful.  The room was nice but quite cramped. You had to step into the shower in order to close the bathroom door if you needed to go to the toilet. We were also incorrectly charged $9 for a bottle of water. What the?? But the staff were happy to rectify this when we approached the desk.  It is a lovely place to stay, and upon looking at the floor plan we realised we had been placed in the smallest room on the floor.  We loved it for our first visit but when we go back we will probably look for somewhere that can fit us, our two suitcases and without a struggle to go to the toilet in peace.;4
Only stayed one night while traveling.  My hubby and I are Hyatt members for years.  Most of our Hyatt experiences are wonderful.  Comfort, cleanliness, service, location ... all are usually top notch.  This Hyatt Regency at LAX is no exception.  Thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay.;4
Rooms smaller however has everything you need! Recommend extending breakfast hours by an additional 1hr to 1.5 hr especially on the weekend. Rooms clean and quiet. Front desk helpful. Price affordable.;4
"We read lots of reviews of the place before going there,most of them were negative,so we prepared ourselves for the worst. And what a surprise it was when it all turned out to be different! The location is the best you can wish. Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Empire State Building, Central Park, museums, hundreds of cafes... they are all there!  Managers at the reception are friendly and helpful, they do everything possible for your comfy stay.  The room... You can't expect a lot from a NYC hotel. The room was quite small, my husband said ""suitable for claustrophobic stays"" ð¤£ð¤£ð¤£ but there was a nice bed with clean linen, no smells,no dirt or dust, really tidy. Also there was a sink with a mirror in the room,and a small bathroom. As we had just a 1-night stay,that was a";4
After months of reading reviews and looking at maps, a friend and I finally decided to book here. We stayed a week so we were crossing our fingers that it was decent enough to see us through. We were definitely satisfied with our choice. Many of the reviews on here are unrealistic - to people wanting 5 star accommodation, BOOK A 5 STAR HOTEL!  We had a fantastic room singled off from the others with a generous sized living room, TV area, separate bathroom and plenty of space. We had 6 bags and they were able to be stored without interfering with our living space.  The included breakfast made a huge difference in our budget. It's the same every morning but it's GREAT VALUE. The beds were large and comfortable and the room was EXTREMELY CLEAN and made over every day before we;4
We reserved a Deluxe King, and were upgraded to a junior king suite, which was a single large room, king bed, sofa and easy chair, safe, big closet, drawers, clean, great view over Broadway. Housekeeping was on the ball, clean, everything worked, front desk staff were friendly and helpful;4
One step into the lobby and you can feel the history at this landmark hotel. Built in 1929 it was a showcase then and is again after a restoration. Many rooms have wonderful views of the Empire State Building. The location near Penn Station is ideal for train traveler and Times Square and midtown are an easy walk.;4
Great location for what we were doing.  Good restaurant attached. Comfortable bed and pillows.  Great shower head in bath.  Would stay there again.  Close to Central Park and shopping.  Also close to Lincoln Center.;4
customer service was amazing loved it. Staff was very efficient . Loved the location. Clean and nice place to stay. Breakfast was okay. over all my stay was pleasant. parking was expensive. Staying in the hyatt was a good experience;4
We booked this hotel through Priceline and we got a pretty good deal. Unfortunately we needed 2 beds and we were booked for a standard that only had 1 bed. Gunita upgraded us to a 2 bedded room for free which was great since we did have a lot of luggage. The room was not that much bigger but can't complain much since we were upgraded for free. All the staff are wonderful especially the hyper flamboyant concierge. Would definitely stay again but I would make sure to book above a standard level.;4
I was so concerned after paying a very nominal cost for a 6 night stay.  Couldnât have been more happy!  Clean, well appointed, great location, everyone was super nice.  Family of 4 was cluttered with clothes but....lol;4
The hotel itself is in a fantastic location for everything to need to in New York. Especially if you are planning to see all those sights ( Empire State, Maddison SQ GDN, etc etc )  It was very clean but just needs somes TLC in places;4
We got a beautiful alcove room for our stay. Comfiest hotel bed ever, we wanted the pillows!The staff are so great. Location perfect for universal. After a long flight the 4pm check in was tough, ac was a bit loud, but regardless really happy.;4
Spent two nights at the Jane.  The location was great.  10 minute walk from the subway and right across West St from the Hudson.  Small lobby with great, helpful staff.  First view of the room as I opened the door was a little disconcerting.  It was very small.  But nice woodwork, very tidy and plenty of storage and hanging space.  And since I was only there from midnight til 7:00 the next morning it was fine.  Bathroom down the hall was never crowded and always clean. There are bicycles to use for free, a nice cafe and the whole place just has a lot of character.  It was fun imagining the hotel filled with seamen back in the day.  I'm already planning another trip there.  Jordan;4
nice hotel only minutes from burbank airport.  Universal studios is next door.  Clean hotel with good customer service and decent hotel gym featuring a cardio room and a separate weight room.  Concierge level provides free breakfast and afternoon snacks.  Downside - valet parking is expensive and self park, which is $15/night, is not convenient.;4
We stayed for three nights, had a king bed that overlooked the park. Staff was really nice and always helpful. Definetly a backpackers hotel, right by the 103st metro stop. Room was small but clean with a nice updated bathroom. Overall, good if you plan on being out and about most of your trip. The only negatives were that there is only one elevator that went out once while we were there and the bed was really hard (and we like a more firm mattress).;4
The rooms were small, like many New York City hotels, but the bed was comfortable and the room nicely appointed.  The lobby.  Oh my.  I met my future brother-in-law at the New Yorker in 1969, and I remember vividly the gold elevator doors in the Art Deco lobby.  The shape of the hotel room doors were concave, then.  It was a nostalgic trip, quite comfortable.;4
Hugo from breakfast buffet is friendly and helpful. You might be fooled by his stern face but deep down, he is very approachable. Love his omelette, sunny-side up and scramble eggs.   Be sure to consider this hotel when you are visiting Hollywood! Itâs near the metro station which will bring you to all most of the Hollywood attraction within 20-30 minutes.;4
Excellent location, you have everything you need close by. Rooms are not big, but have a reasonable size, with nice decor and clean. Service is good and they are willing to help with what you need. They accept incoming mailing prior to arrival, but with cost. Good overall experience, will be back!;4
Our room was perfect for the 3 of us. We had an alcove with a couch besides the 2 double beds. Our granddaughter slept on the couch. Room 722. Amenities were good and great location for subways Restaurants were good especially coffee shop. Only problem we had was with our maid who kept forgetting to leave coffee. Had to call housekeeping.;4
Very nice hotel. We will stay here again! Excellent location. The roof top lounge has an amazing view and a nice place to relax. Overall staff was very accommodating and helpful. This was our first trip to New York and staying at The Empire Hotel.;4
Stayed here one night while we visited Universal Studios. The surrounding area is beautiful and the views are great. We were on the 15th floor and had a view overlooking Universal Studios and Hollywood. We booked a two queen room and tried checking in a little early however they said that no rooms were available until 3. The staff was very nice and helpful.The room was very clean and they welcomed us with a small fruit platter a cupcake and two bottles of water. The beds were comfy and the room was large enough for us to spread out. We had spent the majority of the day at Universal and three days at Disneyland/California Adventure before that so by the time we got into the hotel room we were basically done for the day. We did not try out the pool. We did attempt to get something;4
A unique hotel.  Excellent service.  Room upgrade to a King suite was a nice surprise.  Nice lobey bar with relaxing atmosphere.  Needed some room items and were delivered within 10 minutes.  We enjoyed staying at this West side hotel.  Second floor lobby was relaxing as well.;4
Perfect location right near times square, the bellboy Jeff was very helpful giving me tips on how to use the subway, places to eat and even sorted out our return transfer which I must state was prompt on time top guy unlike the others who cant even crack a smile, apart from the bar only opening at 5pm this is a great hotel right next door to the 3 monkeys Irish bar which I found one of the best we visited in new York, bit pricey though like the rest of the city;4
The hotel staff, bell hops, concierge, and maids were all fantastic. The valet parking was a nightmare.;4
As you would expect if you are planning on visiting Universal whilst in LA then this is the place to stay . Big rooms and great service throughout our stay, the pool is lovely if you want to chill out in the hot California sun. You are also in walking distance from Universal City Walk for evening entertainment and of course get into the park an hour before everyone else.  Why is it not Excellent? The cost.......very expensive but that will be down to the location.;4
I have stayed at this hotel twice and would stay again. Given how expensive hotels can be in NYC, Astor on the Park is good value for money. The hotel is definitely not a swanky hotel and has its quirks but for how much you pay, it is comfortable and easy to access.  The hotel is a about a 20 minute subway ride from all the hustle and bustle so expect to rely on subway/taxi to get into downtown. The hotel is right off a subway line so it's super easy to hop on at 103rd which is only a 3 block walk. The hotel overlooks Central Park and is about a 5-10 minute walk from restaurants and bars on the Upper West Side and Harlem.  If you are looking for a cheap place to crash after a long day with helpful staff and comfortable bed, Astor on the Park is for you. Just be prepared for a 20;4
We chose this hotel because of its close proximity to Universal (which, by the way, we did not really like...but that's a separate issue). Staff here is exceptional and the corner rooms on the highway side have excellent views up into the Hollywood HIlls. Breakfast buffet has a lot to choose from, but can be pricey. There are plenty of restaurants nearby if you prefer not to have room service or eat in the hotel. The only real gripe I have is with the mattresses, which were too springy for us. As a more minor nit, I wished the windows blocked out more of the noise from the nearby highway 101, but of course that's a trade-off that comes with being close to Universal.;4
"I was only here for one night however; the front desk staff was fast and friendly. The room that we were in was very small and in a corner hallway and no other rooms around so it was a little creepy at first and very loud elevators. The hotel has so much history and love how close it is to Empire and Time Square. We would stay here again if ever in NYC";4
Although the room was slightly dingy (light switches and shower could have used some bleach) we were very happy here.  I guess the elevators were small and SLOW (we had to take the stairs more than once) but if you were patient it was fine.   For the price in NY this hotel was great.  It was less than a block from the subway entrance on an express train so all the trains on Broadway stopped there.  It was also a stop on the gray line (hop-on/hop-off buses) which we did ride around the city.  The room was basic, but we did not get the smell or dinginess that others seemed to write about.  Also the staff was amazing.  My daughter (7) ran into a subway pole and her nose starting bleeding uncontrollably.  I literally ran her from the subway to the hotel with her dripping blood down;4
Fabulous location although rooms themselves quite run down. Clean, secure, quiet. Positives outweigh no view from back side room. Tea/Coffee making in room would have been great. Also perhaps washing line in bathroom. There was always staff available and they always acknowledged us.;4
Nice Business Hotel,  efficient, clean but no character.  however you don't tend to need character when you are just about to catch a flight, which is what this hotel is meant for.  They have the added bonus of having a hertz rental drop-off point which is extremely handy if you use them. Staff are friendly and you won't be waiting long to check in.;4
We stay in Manhattan often when we have an event to go to rather than drive home. We stay in different hotels depending where the event is. AMERITANIA is a great place for us to stay for a Broadway play and this is the third stay at this hotel in about two years. They have discontinued the free breakfast we had the first two stays, I'm sure it was in the description and I didn't read it but it was a disappointment anyway. A manager that heard us talking quickly understood the confusion explained the policy change and let us in without any questions. I recommend AMERITANIA to others and will stay there again.;4
I have just returned from a US trip (business and holiday). I spent 7 days in New York staying at the Quality Hotel on Broadway (in Manhattan - 94th St, between Broadway and Amsterdam). Excellent location - 2 delis just across the street, very close to a subway station, heaps of nice restaurants, diners, takeaways, etc. in Amsterdam and Broadway, a couple of blocks from the top end of Central Park. The hotel is old-ish but comfortable. My room had a fridge and air con. and was roomy and clean. Front desk people were friendly and helpful. By New York standards, the rates were reasonable - I would stay there again, and New York is definitely a place you need to go back to!;4
We were a bit surprised by the fee to hold our bags before we could get the keys to our rooms. $5/bag. For only $10 more we could have gotten early check in. Ms. Henry at the information desk was great with suggestions on nearby places to visit before getting our keys. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 37th floor with a nice view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Bryant Park.;4
Second visit to this hotel in 8 months. Great location for all the sights, Time Square and Central Park. Friendly concierge, Juliano and Jeff in particular and staff couldn't help with questions enough. Only slight downside is the air conditioning unit in the rooms is very noisy and despite the fact ear plugs are given it is a bit annoying. All in all would book again;4
Just enjoying a weekend trip in LA. We use this hotel frequently before and after international travel from LAX. Though this trip was for a different purpose, it was very enjoyable as always. Look forward to our next stay.;4
Good hotel at a great location. The staff was very helpful. The only negative i found was the $14 per day parking fee, but I guess that is OK for L.A. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.;4
I had read many, many negative reviews of this hotel on various sites and was very nervous about what lay ahead for us.  We arrived late on March 12th and Miriam greeted us quickly and courteously.  She was amazed that I had drove for 9 hours to get there and so upgraded us to double queen room.  Even though our room was one of those above the HVAC equipment outside, we had our AC running in the room and couldn't hear anything outside.  Yes, there was no view but then we were only in the room to sleep so it didn't matter to us.  The room was very clean and quiet (at the end of the hall).  We loved it.  The shower is odd but that would be our only negative.  The entire staff were friendly and helpful.  The food in the restaurant was good.  We would definitely go back.  Also, the;4
"I stayed in one of the single ""cabins"" for two nights. The room was very small but well-designed and quiet. A shared bathroom was just down the hall and always very clean. The showers were large with dinner plate sized shower heads and good water pressure (4th floor). The staff was very professional and friendly. The location between the West Village and the Meatpacking district is excellent, just south of the Highline but a bit of a walk from the subway lines. If you stay here, have dinner at Barbuto around the corner.";4
If in Hollywood especially going to Universal studios must stay here. Can walk to City walk, close to warner Bros and Disney. Full service, self park at a price and nice surroundings Great breakfast  Give yourself extra time as they have issues with their elevators On going issue  Hollywood and restaurants are very close , 5 minute drive;4
Nice room with all the amenities and service youâd need. Deva was great as a concierge. Pool facilities are excellent, very clean and spaced Out. East Hollywood area isnât the best but hotel makes up for it.;4
The Empire Hotel was recommended to me by a work colleague and I was very pleased with my experience there. I was very happy with the location, the quality and cleanliness of the room, the helpfulness of the staff and my overall experience at the hotel. Certainly , the hotel had competitive pricing compared with other hotels in the vicinity. I would definitely stay at the Empire again and to recommend it to friends.;4
The location is really nice, very close to Penn Station on 34th Street. Empire State Building is within 10 mins walk. Lots of restaurant and pharma around the area and just 15-20 mins walk to Times Square.  The standard room is good enough for 2.  Not too spacious but comfortable enough. Staff are really nice and friendly.  If you're planning to be out anyway the whole day for tours, then this is just perfect to be your sleeping ground.;4
Beautiful hotel, great location at Lincoln Center. In the city for our daughter's graduation recital and the parties on the roof were sometimes loud, but handy dandy earplugs were helpful for a good night's sleep.;4
We stayed four nights at the Empire and have stayed there several times in the past.  The location is awesome-plenty of dining and activities near by, and Central Park really close. Staff extremely helpful. We had a corner junior suite with wonderful views of Lincoln Center. Room clean, bed super comfy.  Bar lobby fun vibe with food offered and good drinks. Check out the rooftop bar, too!;4
Hotel staff was professional and provided good service.  Chris, the concierge was excellent and quite good at following up with details.  The location is central to being near Central Park and the Upper West Side.  My room was relaxing, though it was a bit worn and in need of freshening up.  But this wasn't an overall negative.  WIFI was ok but not great at times.  Wasn't to much of an issue.  Just odd that in 2015 WIFI isn't a top priority.  But hey, It's the USA and you can't always count on technology being up to standards.  Overall, nice stay at the Empire.;4
Good hotel with the location being the number one selling point for us.We took the advice of our booking company - Trailfinders and were happy overall with the stay. The room was small - but if you want to stay in your room for long periods , then probably don't go to New York on holiday! Bed was comfortable , bathroom and shower was clean and well appointed.Our view was awful!!! If you remember the Friends episode when Joey sings good morning to his neighbour from roughly 3m opposite,then you have a realistic mental image of the view from our window.Luckily on the TV there was a fixed CCTV camera on nearby Columbus Circle which we used to tell what the weather was like before venturing out. Decor is autumnal , staff were helpful , didn't eat here so can't comment on restaurant;4
The location is really great. facilities are somewhat worn, and we had some technical difficulties. never managed to connect to WiFi, had to pick up re-coded keys because of malfunction, and the valet parking was not user friendly(not possible to ask for your car to be delivered at a certain time(?) but always call to ask for it 20 min in advance. I believe this is convenience for the front desk, not the customer.;4
"If you enjoyed Gossip Girl and in Nyc, it's certainly a stop for the night. I had a resort in Atlantic City but for my wife's birthday we came for the ambience and go see mets. We paid 239 for weeknight which includes tax.  Parking is 60, or next street is 35.  Room was the smallest I've had 180 Sq ft Inc bathroom, but nice decoration, upgraded shower... no curtain or door.  Keep the window treatments closed, it's nicer than looking at brick from courtyard view.  I could have upgraded for more money for larger room, king bed but I'm sure it wasn't a ""Chuck Bass"" suite.  Room is stocked with items to purchase from chips, liquor and kcups.  Starbucks in same building.  Wonderful pool deck area and classy lounge on ground floor.  Ac kept popping breaker and maintenance guy had to";4
Small bathrooms! Otherwise overall good or better rating  for an older hotel. Staff is  very helpful & great! Centrally located to attractions. Not top on my list  but acceptable for us. Felt safe in that area which is important to me.;4
Great hotel located close to many attractions.  Just know when they say 3pm check-in that is a firm time!  This was our second stay at the property.   The roof tip bar is a a great place to grab a drink or 2 and has very good views of the local area.    We would stay at the property again!;4
I thought the Days Inn Hotel would be perfect for me and it was. Great location, easy to get there from the subway at 94th St. The staff was lovely, the room was comfy. It's shabby, needs paint & refurbishing but I was cosy and comfortable. Travelling alone as a woman I am picky about safety & this hotel was very secure. No frills but I loved it & would definitely return. You won't be sorry if you choose this hotel expecting no frills but a safe & clean place to stay in a great location.;4
The hotel is convenient to theaters, subway and Central Park. Rooms are small but comfortable. Very clean Bathrooms appear to be brand new. The staff were excellent. Matthew the manager was very hospitable and professional.;4
Great hotel and location.  Very close to Central Park.  Air conditioning needs upgrade: very noisy and room needs some TLC.  Staff very friendly. However it's was a fantastic holiday we would stay again.;4
Short walk from Universal or regular shuttle buses run.... Very clean and comfortable, hassle free check in and out! Good spacious rooms, there were 4 of us and it was perfect Nice bar to relax after the adrenaline rush of Universal........;4
1920s vibe in lobby and halls. Friendly staff. Very clean. Bathrooms were very small but the water pressure was great and loved the rain shower head. Beds and pillows were comfy. Would definitely stay again.;4
"The New Yorker Hotel was a great selection for this trip.  It is centrally located and its closeness to the train station and the subway lines makes it a terrific starting point for whatever activities you have planned for the day.  The New Yorker, as with real estate, comes down to ""location, location, location"".  The location was ideal and the service was equally impressive.";4
Great location!  Would've preferred to see less mildew on curtains and a/c, but i guess thats bexause of the weather.  Everything else was very clean and comfy.  Lobby was great place to meet company.  Surrounded by restaurants.;4
We were given an upgrade when arriving without asking. That was really nice, after a 16 hours flight. It was a nice, spacious and just renewed room. But, the shower was dirty. We asked for it to be cleaned but they rather changed us to another room. That one was very small and with a run down bathroom. Elevator service was too slow. They gave us one free breakfast though.;4
"I stayed three nights at the Jane, and here are some tips for you should you decide to stay at this very reasonable and pleasant hotel:  1) The bed: it is not only a single bed (for those going solo), it is against a wall. This means even less manoeuvring. Here's a tip: swivel the mattress 180 degress. Why? The lip of the mattress has likely been compressed and as a result the mattress ""angles"" toward the edge. With the more stable lip of the mattress that has been facing the wall now turned to the bed's edge, you won't angle off toward the edge. AND you can then move the mattress about a handwith away from the wall without fear of falling over as that stable lip doesn't hand down. This made all the difference in the world for my sleeping, that little bit of extra room.  2)";4
We stayed 2 nights close to the LAX airport in order to visit a few sights and see the Getty Center. We were on the 5th floor and the room was totally quiet even though we could see the planes flying over. The bed was excellent. Clean and comfortable room. All the staff were very polite and helpful. We consulted with two Concierge. They are also helping with luggage so ask for help at the front desk. Both of them were clear, detailed, knowledgeable and helped us get exactly what we wanted from our brief visit to LA. The tourist information is kept in their back room so you need to ask for help. There is a full restaurant for breakfast and a more casual, âto goâ area. We ate in both places. The food was very good and freshly made in the casual spot, if you want to save money. The;4
Visiting New York for the week by myself, I needed a hotel which was centrally located within walking distance of many places of interest and on the subway.  This fitted the bill.  My 23rd floor room had a view westwards to the Hudson River.  It was smaller than I expected, but had everything I needed. The bathroom was a little dated, but the shower worked well. I did not eat at the hotel which did have 2 restaurants - but there are so many other places to choose from!  The A/C was efficient.;4
I have stayed at this hotel 5 times in the past year, as I do business in North Hollywood.  This is a very large hotel, but it is kept in great shape.  The rooms are nicely appointed, but my favourites are the corner King rooms - they are very spacious, and have an interesting layout.  I never worry about hearing my neighbours - the rooms seem well soundproofed.  The pool and hot tub are great - nice ambiance and palm trees, and though close to the 101, fairly peaceful.  The hotel is very well situated - 10 minutes from Hollywood, right next to the Hollywood Hills, close to Burbank and North Hollywood as well.  The 101, 170 and 134 Freeways are at your doorstep as well.   I've been very happy with the staff here as well - I've become familiar to them, and they've always treated;4
So we arrived at the Whyndam New Yorker  and the first feeling walking in was Comfort , friendly , Clean , Safety,  Then we met Mohammed who checked us in he was lovely i  asked him if we could have a room with a View of the city so he did his best and gave us a room with a View which was beautiful , Mohammed told us a bit about the Hotel which was Interesting and my Daughter knew all about what he was telling us. He explained where everything was , computer room, Gym , Diner which was opened 24hours and trust me you will be glad at 4 or 5 in the morning when jet lag gets hold of you , and you don't know if you want to order Breakfast or a Burger but you can  order what you like it's a great place to eat , staff so friendly . The Room was your basic hotel room double bed TV what;4
After reading few negative reviews about this hotel, we were a bit afraid of what we could get but...we only have good things to say about it. It is sutuate just off Broadway street away from the busy street. Very near the metro subway, restaurants, coffee shops (Starbucks around the corner with free wi-fi and a supermaket with a nice deli section. Definetly good value for money - You cant go wrong if you dont expect luxury but a basic clean and quite place to sleep after your day walks.;4
My sister and I had tickets to see Oprah:  2020 Vision at The Forum. So, to reduce the stress of driving to the event the next morning, we stayed the night before at the Hyatt Regency LAX.  We parked next door at QuikPark, a very short walk from the Hyatt.  We had breakfast at the hotel before leaving.  From our room, we had marvelous views of the LAX pylons (which change colors) and the airport runways.;4
I had a great one night stay here in December 2012! The room was small but definitely suited our needs. The bedding/floors/bathroom were clean. The staff was friendly. The location for the price could NOT be beat - 3 blocks from a subway station, across the street from Central Park! Great 24 hour deli down the street. The only issue I had was the outlet power - some of the sockets did not work. Had to do a little rearranging to get my phone to charge. Room did run very warm at night but the air conditioner provided offset that problem. Just FYI, no refrigerator!;4
Staff was very nice. Jeff went above and beyond helping my girlfriend and I get to the NYC half marathon on time! Huge thanks! Rooms were clean, bed was only ok. Hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square and Central Park.;4
"We were looking for a hotel just for night in Manhattan, New Yorker is right next to Madison Square Garden. Old but clean, the staff was polite, the room was small but for ""price-quality"" it's a good option for NYC. I used gym in the morning which had decent equipment. Location is great, walking distance to pretty much anything in Manhattan. I would definitely consider this hotel during my next visit in NYC.";4
Good hotel, good location, far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Time Square but close enough you can walk. Around 10-15 min to Time Square and very close to Central Park. Very nice roof top pool and bar.;4
My wife and I stayed in the Empire for four nights in May and were really pleased with our choice of hotel. I was a bit worried after reading many reviews that complained about small rooms. Due to this I upgraded our room at the time of booking to a deluxe king room which did not really cost that much more. The room size was absolutely fine, plenty big enough for us and our clothes, suitcases etc. The bathroom was very clean and the shower was great and the big bed was very comfy. We really liked the roof bar, it was very hot when we were there and sitting on the roof with a cold beer was fantastic. I can also recommend Ed's Chowder house and PJ Clarkes restaurant. I would recommend this hotel, although you may want to follow suit and upgrade your room.;4
I really enjoyed my brief stay at the historically correct Jane Hotel in the West Village. Wish I had had more time to hang out in the bar and comfortable, quirky lobby, but would definitely return. Good value for money, if you don't mind tiny rooms and a shared bath. My only (minor) complaint was water all over the floor in the shower in the morning, but luckily I brought my shower thongs! As a few other reviewers have mentioned, rooms in The Jane suffer from the classic New York problem of being overheated, so I cranked up the ceiling fan and cracked the window for some fresh air and it was fine. This happens a lot in the winter with steam heat in NYC apartments and hotel rooms, be advised!   I thought the service and food in Cafe Gitane downstairs was relaxed but responsive,;4
Just back after staying 5 nights at the empire hotel.The hotel was great, the roof top bar is fantastic and the staff could,nt do enough.The only problem was the room, I had emailed 2 weeks before , saying it was my girlfriends first trip to New York and would it possible to have a room with a view  ( any view) when we arrived,  we were told there was none available. The room we got ( 514 ) was superb,  clean , great beds, problem was it faced a brick wall,never opened the curtains, didn't know if it was night or day.if you look at the hotel i would think most rooms face the front, but no available . Also when we checked out , it would of been nice ,to be asked how our stay was? Overall it is a great hotel and Eugene the doorman was very helpful, would stay again , but with;4
"I arrived by car and self parked in the garage, which has dedicated elevators. If you turn left as soon as you enter the parking level (self parking on P2 and P3), you find the already modernized elevators that take to the lobby. If you turn right, you find other elevators on the side of the building and you will have a longer walk to the reception.  The hotel is not new but the common areas are all in very good shape.  I had a corner room on the 22nd floor with a great view on Universal Studios and the mountains.  The room and bathroom were large, the room decor was good despite not being really contemporary. The 32"" TV was enclosed in a ""CRT style"" piece of furniture. The desk was a bit uncomfortable with its stylish and sharp cornered legs that keep hitting in the knees.  The";4
I visited this hotel late last year. To be honest with you I was unsure about this hotel but because it was in the right location I decided to go with it.  There was a lot of talk on here that it was not in a good area. This hotel is near hospitals and the area is safe. It is between two subways station - one around 5 minutes walk at the most the other is around 15 minuite walk,  which is very handy for those without a car. We had a car so it wasn't an issue. This hotel is not actually right in the centre of Hollywood, it is around 5-10 minuites drive at the most from the centre of Hollywood.  There is a carpark at the hotel but it is expensive. We just parked on the road at the side of the hotel. You need to read the sign because one day in the week they clean the road in the;4
This hotel is in a great location, yes it can be a little bit noisy at times, we were there during the Harry Potter frenzy, but the upside was I had a great view of the red carpet from my hotel window!  Just a short walk away from Central Park, great if you fancy hiring a bike and cycling around the city.  The interior was very modern and funky in design, the room was average sized and had a really comfortable bed.  We didn't eat there but we did eat at Ed's Chowder restaurant next door, which was excellent!  The pool on the roof is small (not surprisingly) and it had a cover over it, which spoilt it a little, however great location to have a cocktail and watch the sun set over Manhattan.;4
I've stayed at the Empire Hotel several times. The hotel is in a GREAT location.  It's a block from Central Park and across the street from the Met.  Museums and Columbus Circle are easily walked.  The hotel is flanked by 2 restaurants that are a convenience.  One is a popular drinking spot.  There is also a movie theater across the street, Starbucks and grocery.  The hotel has charm but it's a little delapidated.  There is a rooftop pool and the roof becomes a nightclub on the weekends. This is a fun hotel for girls weekend or for a reliable place to stay when going to the theater. If they update the worn out patches, I'd give it 5 stars for all the perks.;4
Stayed here for the second time for business. Ideal location for quick access to all kinds of public transportation. Although it is a big property, the rooms are pretty nice and - for NY - quiet. The wifi is very fast!;4
The value at the hotel is great.  Very good housekeeping staff and the shower set it apart.  It's like a waterfall.  The rooms aren't big but the bathroom is really tiny.  If you are over 5'5 you will need to turn at an angle when using the bathroom.  Just be aware!;4
We stayed here for our first visit to overseas. Its in a fantastic location..a five minute walk to universal studios and citywalk. The rooms are great, only problem is our room smelt like smoke. The bed was comfy as and the concierge was very helpful. Would definately reccomend and stay again :);4
I stay in NYC a couple of weekends each month, and I have stayed in many different places. Now when I come into NYC I stay at the Morningside Inn exclusively.  Comfortable, affordable and adorable, the Inn is located on the gorgeous Upper West Side next to a beautiful Cathedral.  The staff, which allows 24 hour check-in, is so friendly and helpful.  The owner/operator Patrick has been extremely helpful and accommodating when it comes to booking my stay, but I have also had no trouble booking online.    The price can't be beat.  They have an accommodation for any traveler's budget.  I really recommend this great little Inn.;4
Staying here for 3 nights midweek was really easy. Itâs close to Broadway and walking around for everything I needed was not a hassle in any way. I didnât eat at the hotel, so just used my room for sleeping and working.. WiFi was excellent for connecting for conference calls and late check in was accommodated with no problem. I just found a couple of the fixtures werenât in great shape, as it feels like there are a few areas that would benefit from a bit of love. great for work trips or short stays & would definitely recommend;4
Stayed here for a few nights on a last minute trip to LA. The staff were very friendly, and breakfast chefs were great. Only downside was the wifi was down one night, however when it was back it was much faster than expected!  Iâd stay here again.;4
Can't go wrong here.  Turn your car in, stay within minutes of the airport.  Everything you need - food, drink, fitness, etc  are inside.  Really don't have to go out if you don't want to.  But if you do, it's close to lots of food and bar choices.  Staff is always first class.  Rooms can be a little small but are tastefully decorated, clean, and modern.;4
I was very impressed with the service I received at the Empire. It was my first time staying there and not my last. My friends and I were looking forward to a night away in New York and we couldn't have asked for anything more. The empire roof top bar was great and looking forward to going back in the summer. The bar was beautiful as well as the lobby area. It could use some things updated (i.e. small bathroom, all day access to rooftop) however, I look forward to attending again.;4
We stayed here for one week - great location for the attractions of Los Angeles. Staff super friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was expensive and there are better cheaper options nearby. We liked Bea Beas & The Good Neighbor restaurants which were both nearby. Rooms fine though not modern. Only negative was the lifts which took an age - but the hotel was quite clear about this being work in progress to improve.;4
I originally reserved a room at the Sheraton next door to the Hilton but then cancelled that after I read so many low rated reviews. I'm really glad I did! The Hilton was more expensive but it was clean, the staff were very nice and always cheerful.;4
Great location on the south bank close to the London eye and easy access to central London.Plenty of places to eat nearby.Room was clean and comfortable with everything you need. Breakfast was good value;4
As a solo traveler, I didn't want to pay loads on accommodation. I see a hotel as a place for sleeping, washing and as a base for exploring. This hotel was very ideal for me, simply because it was not in the hustle bustle of the city centre.   With it being next to Central Park, and not in Times Square, I was guaranteed a good nights sleep with no traffic or people noise. The subway was very handy for getting in to the main parts of the city. If you aren't brave enough to get on the subway it was only $13 in a yellow cab.  Only negative I found was that I couldn't work out how to use the shower. I should have asked at the reception but I was content using the bath  in all honesty. There was no canteen or bar but they did recommend a cafe on Columbus Avenue called Crepes - which;4
The room had some small deficiencies: nit clean under the air condition, no shower curtain, the curtain was not to open fully. The bed were absolutely clean and comfortable. All stuff members very friendly and helpful. A top located Hotel with a easy and friendly atmosphere. The right place for a holiday without much fuss about. I have enjoyed it. Think of coming again.;4
We enjoyed our stay and the hotel.  The road to the hotel is/was under construction during our stay so that was a bit inconvenient.  Other than that we enjoyed our stay and it's proximity to Universal Studio's Hollywood.  Shuttle service was very frequent and the hotel staff was outstanding.;4
All you want for your holiday is a clean affordable place to stay. Well Midtown west is all that and more. Perfect location just a few meters from Penn Station. Very nice places to get food and drinks around hotel. And most attractions were walking distance from hotel.;4
A great little hotel to stay when visiting NY. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Small but not unexpected in NY. Only complaint was the AC was very noisy and the nights were very warm. Location was just great with the subway only minutes walk from the door. Extra good is the corner deli right out side the front door. Only closed for 3 hours a day so a perfect spot for breakfast lunch or anytime really. The staff were very helpful too.;4
I travelled to New York with my partner in February 2019 and stayed at The Empire Hotel. The location of this hotel was perfect!. The subway was right outside and loads of shops around too. Times Square was one subway stop and about 20 minute walk. The room was small but as are all rooms in hotels in New York, the reception is modern however the rooms were a bit outdated. They only thing we found that we didn't like was the heater was so loud and most nights woke me up but other than that everything was great!. The hotel staff were lovely and was always happy to help.  Would defiantly recommend.;4
I found the staff to over the top friendly and helpful. the rooms are well appointed as well as the bathroom.  Free shuttle to Universal studios and Citywalk. The outside pool and hot tub area was really nice and had a large patio. There is even a poolside bar. My only complaint would be the slow internet service on my floor (20th) and sometimes weak signal. Otherwise I very much enjoyed my stay here. I had free wifi but not sure it was because I was a Hilton Honors member.;4
The rooms are above average but the service and location takes the cake. It is right opposite the penn station and also walgreens and numerous restaurants around the corner for a perfect place to stay for exploring New york.;4
Stay here in Oct 2010 for 5 days great area room nice, clean, quite, breakfast nice added touch and filling.  Balconies looked niced but were hardly opened to go out sit and relax. Had to returned and stayed in Dec 2010 for 4 days same exact service.  Can get to everywhere in LA fast.  Highly recommend the place AAA+++;4
I forgot to book a room till a month before fashion week so it was either the last bunkbed room at The Jane through the convention rate at $145 tax per night or a whatever hotel in midtown for +$400. The room is a tiny as a room can be and I don't think I would have been comfortable if I had shared with anyone as I used the upper bunk as layaway and suitcase storage. If you are solo and have little luggage go for a room without the bunkbed as it will feel a lot bigger.  The staff was brilliant and the hallway shared bathroom was not an issue which had worried me quite a bit before arrival. It was clean and no more than a minute or 2 wait at the max.   The complementary water bottles were a nice surprise but did have the distinct taste of chlorine ...but hey so does any postmix;4
Stayed here for 4 days with my teenagers, check  in @ 4pm & it gets really crowded, can check in early for additional fee$. Breakfast buffet is ok- nothing special- the waitstaff seems a bit odd - if your kids just want omelette then pls - don't buy the buffet for $28- it's a waste - notice that they push u to go to buffet ðð½- breakfast ends @10:30. The room is decent size for $400/night a kingsize bed + queen size sofa bed. Housekeeping is great  Clean- lots if towel & fast.  Pool is small like for kids only. Staff are friendlyð  Location is a  10 min shuttle ride to universal studios  perfect place to stay-. Elevator is better thN 2 years ago & attendants are super nice & welcoming.  Minus 1 star ------  No Wifi you pay $8 for 24 hours- it sucks !!!;4
Great location close to everything. Walk to Macyâs, Town Square, the Empire State Building. We had a room with two beds, two dressers, two chairs, and 2 closets which made it very convenient. The only complaint was the small bathroom.  Great security, very clean, and helpful staff. They have 3 eating options, and a gym.;4
Although pricy the hotel is well placed, just across the street from the Met Opera. It is a great location for opera lovers, like me. Our room had a view to the Met Opera - great for the view, but not so much for sleep, as it can be very noisy during the night. The bed was comfortable, which is important for busy travellers, or vacationers. To be mentioned that I had to call every morning to request for the coffee capsules to be replenished in the room - this should not be the case for a four-star hotel! Overall we had a good stay and it is a great place to consider, especially for those planning to attend events at the Lincoln Center.;4
This hotel is at a brilliant location. It's walking distance to nearly everything. If not catch the subway. Was given a rubbish room on 24th floor couldn't swing a guinee pig in. But was able to change it to a room where you could just about swing a cat on the 33rd floor. Would stay here again.;4
"A de rigeur stay when in the area. while the rooms are showing their age the staff and amenities make up for much.  First night was in ROH standard room. blech. Though upgraded to the executve level (meaningless as theyve removed the executive lounge in 2008 so just a high floor) the only benefit is a special continetal breakfast room included, which is already included in my frequent property guest program level ive attained. . added a stay and I checked back in the next day using a kiosk- never used them so thought id try it, and after entering all the info etc had to go to desk anyway. Front Desk staff ""Linda' (reminds me slighltly of Karen from WIll and grace) was fantastic, friendly, helpful and upgraded me to a king civer room. She was so helpful and described every";4
Hotel is aging, but mostly gracefully. Clean and has an amazing staff that are very accommodating. Don't miss the Lobby Bar for good cocktails in a relaxing atmosphere. Typical small room, but very well appointed. Slow elevators and AC was never cold enough for me.;4
Universal City is cheesy, and unless you're into that sort of thing, you're not going to LOVE this place.  That said, the rooms are nice, contemporary and the bathrooms are roomy. Room service and desk staff were good.   A co-worker and I tried to grab a quick bite from one of the little cafe areas off of the lobby. The poor hotel employee was trying to prepare food in the closet-like kitchen for about 20 minutes. My co-worker is a vegetarian and the worker had to go to the main kitchen to find the veggie option that was on their menu. It turned into quite an ordeal.   Other dining options close by are in Universal City. The Wolfgang Puck restaurant was good, and probably the least packed-to-the-gills with screaming kids (I don't think I saw any kids there at all). The sushi;4
I have stayed in quite a few hotels by LAX.  I found most of them to be old and with terrible sound proof windows.  The Hyatt Regency is a nice modern hotel with celan, sleek rooms and, most importantly, good sound proof windows!  Do not expect luxury but a very decent property by the airport.;4
An eclectic hotel, close to the subway and many attractions.  Confortable with a nice and helpfull staff.  Rooms are big (very rarely in NYC).  A great option if your are theatre lover.  The Central park is quite near, so you can run every day;4
We just had a great stay at the Hilton UniversalCity.  It was my family's first time visiting Universal Studios and we knew we were in for a long day, late night visiting the attractions, including new Harry Potter section.  This location could not have been better.  It's a quick walk or shuttle ride to the park.  Our room was clean (and bigger than I expected), staff was friendly and we really enjoyed the diverse breakfast buffet.  Our great view of the park was a bonus.  I would stay again.;4
Stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights before joining a cruise (which was subsequently cancelled). Location was superb, great if you like walking as we walked to most of the attractions even the Statten Island ferry, albeit a long way!! On arrival check in was really quick and efficient with friendly staff.  We had a problem with the cleanliness of the shower on the first night and Crystal was superb in recognising the problem and moved us to a far nicer room. Next time we would definitely ask for one of the refurbished rooms as the previous room was quite dated.  We ate in the restaurant one night and the meal was fantastic.  Would definitely return.;4
My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and had a great stay. We stayed on the airport side and you couldn't hear a thing! Windows did great at keeping out the sound. The room was great, clean and spacious. We never really got enough large towels. There were only 2 large towels per room and if you showered after the maid came that day you were out of luck unless you called to request more. The only other thing I had an issue with was they took way longer than they should have to prepare our room when we booked it months in advance. Check in time was at 3, we arrived in at 11 am which was no problem, they said they'd text us when it was ready. Never got anything so around 3 we came back and it still wasn't ready. It was after 4 before we were able to go up to our room.;4
"Being a former New Yorker, i can truly say that this hotel is perfectly located... i can also say, it's a little too 'touristy' for my liking, but, what can you expect the week before Christmas in NYC ;-) When we arrived, the lobby and bar were packed with tourists, their suitcases, their kids... sprawled out everywhere you looked. The staff at check in were fabulous, so welcoming and friendly... A great check-in experience. Our 8th floor room looked out over Lincoln Center with 2 huge windows, and a lovely king size bed. We had a deluxe room which we found to be comfortable and spacious (by NYC standards) The finishes were  a bit rough around the edges, which is of course from the high volume of tourist traffic. It is a real shame they offer $3 Keurig Coffee in your room..";4
After reading many reviews about this hotel I can say I was a little nervous about what I might find. The good news is the room was clean but the decor was some what dated, but you don't go to New York to sit in a hotel room and if you do it's a waste. I can now report 3 lifts are working and they can be slow but it was no issue. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, they try to get me to upgrade on check in but it's their job so I have no issue with that. The massive plus side is the location the metro in NYC is a god send and being just across the road made getting around so easy and Central Park is two blocks east.  Thank you for having us and I would stay here again. P.s The Wi-Fi worked fine;4
My husband and I stayed at The Empire hotel for 3 nights in mid july for our 4th year wedding anniversary. I asked when booking for a nice room and got just that - a nice room with a stunning view of the Lincoln Centre. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, spacious enough for two and services were good. The hotel gave us champagne as a celebration and that was unexpected. The rooftop pool is small but it's nice to cool down on those hot summer days. Food and drinks are expensive both in the lobby, the rooftop and in your room. My advice? Buy your own stuff and hit up a couple happy hours in the neighbourhood. Get a feel for the area. Don't waste your money on the refreshments in the fridge. People who complain about the bathroom (yes the shower only has one door and;4
Room was smart and clean with a great view of the theme park, check in and restaurant staff were friendly. Food was good and location is handy - although still a little walk to the theme park. Would recommend anyone visited the park to stay here.;4
Stayed for 2 nights Dec 31/Jan1st. Rang in the New Year at universal city watched the fireworks. Location cannot be beat if you are visiting Universal City. Shuttle every 15 minutes. King standard room. No view this time. Hot water was too hot in the  bathroom sink couldnât regulate it.  Check in was smooth. Hilton Honors got free water and free internet. Fridge in room was convenient. Requested extra towels and some amenities and they were ready in our room upon arrival. Great service. Beds very comfortable. Price isnât the cheapest but would definitely stay again when visiting universal.;4
I booked this hotel a month in advance.  I then started reading some reviews and was terribly anxious, as I read some horrible things.  Let me just say that I was comforted the moment we checked in.  The front desk- Bobby- was as pleasant as could be.  We got our room in seconds and although it was a little small, it was clean and bright (even at 3am)!  My boyfriend and I have stayed all over this world and we both agreed that we have NEVER, ever slept with the comforter on a bed- until now.  I've read reviews with people talking about dirty bedding- we did not see this and we actually slept with ALL the bedding.  It was the most comfortable sleep I have had away from home!   The room was a little small, but it served its purpose as we were not there to hang out in a hotel room.;4
Overall stay and impressions of the hotel are great. Beautiful and clean. Easy access to subway, lots of places to eat and shop all around the location. I like the security of having to show your key to get past the lobby or to use any of the facilities downstairs. I felt very secure and safe.;4
We stayed here on a family trip.  We were visiting Universal Studios, Warner Brothers Studios, and Disney Studios.  Was very easy to walk to the city area of Universal for dinners, the buffet was good in the morning (but expensive if we'd had to pay).    We had some issues with our room when we checked in, but they were quick to remedy the issues.  First room had not been serviced by housekeeping, we walked in and immediately saw towels all over and the beds unmade.  Got the second room, it was hot and the air conditioner would not kick on even turned down to 63.  Third room was finally the one that worked out.  They gave us some perks for our trouble, it was the first stop of a 4 hotel trip so we had lots of bags to move between the rooms, plus going from EST to PST we were;4
"My family of 4 stayed 3 nights. Very nice, quaint & comfortable hotel; going to stay there again for the Labor Day weekend, this time with my sister visiting from Texas. Also liked the mini gift shop with super reasonable prices for those forgotten items.";4
This hotel is in a great location for sightseeing, we arrived via Penn Station which is a stone's throw of the hotel.  We found it a central point for walking and picking up the tourist hop on/off bus. Lots of places to eat nearby, Tick Tock was great for breakfast. Hotel was clean and welcoming as were the staff. The room was nice, well equipped but let down by the size and view from the window, a brick wall.  However how much time do you spend in your room when you're in New York?? Wifi was good and all telephone calls were free including international.  We had our luggage stored for the day prior to our late evening flight home at a small reasonable charge.   Overall we a had a comfortable stay here, would definitely return and recommend.;4
I chose this hotel for a weekend break in the city during a 2 week business trip to New Jersey. I wanted an Art Deco hotel that reflected the glamour of the 30s and 40s New York - old school glamour. In this respect, the hotel largely fulfilled all my expectations as the hotel lobby is nice and impressive with low of Art Deco features. I opted for a slightly upgraded room so I would be on a higher floor with a better view. The room was a little small but to be expected in NYC and had some more Art Deco touches that appealed to me a lot. However, I found the service to be impersonal and mistrustful with rather spoiled the experience - the staff seemed to be on the defensive all the time as if the guests were potential thieves who should be monitored. They did not engage in any;4
Across from Madison Square Garden and walking distance or a short subway ride to the theater district/Times Square. An easy walk to Hudson Yards and the High Line as well. Rooms are nice, staff was excellent and the hotel has an interesting history (check out the photos and other historical artifacts on display below the lobby!);4
My cousin and I stayed here Sept 27 to Sept 30. We checked in later in the night with no issues. We were given a room with a view of the park which was a nice extra.  As previous reviews have stated this hotel is PERFECT for people who want to get the most out of New York. It's a place to sleep and have a clean bathroom/shower. Our time in NY was limited so we were up early and back late.  Everything was very clean, the bathroom and the beds were up to standard. I found that the water pressure was REALLY good which you usually don't find in hotels.  The staff was really great. They gave us good recommendations on where to eat, what was cheap or expensive. We needed some extra towels and they were brought up immediately.   Yes the hotel is an older building, but they have kept it;4
If you plan on visiting Universal Studios then this hotel is ideally placed. The park itself is only a few minutes walk but there is also a free shuttle for those less able (or lazy in my case!). There is also a metro at the bottom of the hill that provides quick access to Hollywood. The hotel itself is very well equipped and the size of the rooms is very generous. Having Universal CityWalk so close by we never dined at the hotel but saw a very attractive seafood buffet laid out. The only negative thing which stopped me giving 5 stars were the elevators - they were so slow in coming. With about 5 or so elevators you wouldn't have thought there would be an issue but waits of 5 plus minutes were the norm not the exception and of course by the time one did come they would often be;4
Stayed here to attend a concert at the Gibson. Disappointed in the lack of amenities/value for price paid. Had a better experience at a Best Western in Coalinga , CA (cow country) last weekend- at least there I had free parking, free Wi-Fi, and a free FULL hot breakfast. Received none of the above at the Hilton. $8/ day for Internet? Â What MOTEL doesn't include this in their rate anymore? Â $18 to SELF-PARK my car? Â Gouge Universal Citywalk tourists, not paying hotel guests! Â Ice machine non-functional, had to go to another floor to get ice. Room Â freshener/Febreze overpowering, had to prop room door upon arrival, not exactly a secure feeling for women travelers. Â Only 3 Kleenex before they ran out in the bathroom. Â Bottled water/soda vending unavailable. Next time I'll try the;4
If the room had any size to at at all this would of been 5 stars but I've never stayed in such a tiny room and I was told it was one of the renovated rooms.  However it is located in the best area for getting to wonderful places and the beds had to be the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed on.;4
My room was freshly renovated, and it was beautiful, amazing bathroom. The courtyard in the middle of the hotel was darling, beautifully lit with hanging lights and a sweet birdsong constantly playing. The dining room was a little dark, a little dingy, though the complimentary breakfast food was good, omelettes made fresh, toast, fruit, bagels - they could be a little cleaner with their silverware though. It's an older hotel, it has a vintage feel, but the age shows in the elevator, the door to the public bathroom, and the walls that need painting - they are in the process of renovations though and I look forward to coming back to see the finished look.;4
This is a large hotel only 10 minutes walk from Universal Studios and 10 minutes by taxi from Warner Bros.The staff are very friendly and helpful - the concierges certainly know their stuff. Rooms are large and comfortable, though the windows did not open. Fortunately, the air handling was quiet. The Cafe Sierra serves an excellent seafood buffet on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings and its meals on other nights were very good. The bar also serves tasty bites. There is an outdoor pool with a bar and grill. The gardens are nice, with humming birds flitting about. Smoking rooms are available at the moment, but there is a room next to the bar which is open to the sky and with tables, chairs and heaters where smoking is permitted. Other smoking areas are available outside, also;4
Friends invited us to LA to view one of the final tapings of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and they chose this hotel based on past experience.  It was a very good choice.  We stayed in a scrupulously clean King Alcove room, which was HUGE, as was the bathroom (you could have a party in the bathroom).  There was a vanity area in the bathroom with a lighted make-up mirror (with magnification on one side for ladies my age).  A small refrigerator is included. There was also a beautiful view.  Unfortunately, there is no free WiFi unless you have enough HiltonHonors points, but they do provide a daily hour of free WiFi in the lobby if you check with the desk.  The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable, although the pillows were pretty tough (think of the old Western movies;4
The hotel is quite decent in terms of the rooms. Location is great, right across the street from Lincoln Centre and one block away from the Central Park. Bar upstairs seems to be a happening place on the weekends given the line ups at the front door.  Breakfast in the restaurant is pricy but good. It was worth staying there considering the corporate room discount that provided a 30% break in price.;4
We stayed at the Jane for 3 nights in a bunk bed cabin. Having read the reviews, we knew to expect our room to be small. It was, but we were only there to sleep. Having also looked at many other places online before booking, this was the best value for our money for a weekend in the city. The room was on the 3rd floor and was quiet, clean and the beds were comfy.  The individual rooms for toilets and showers made the shared bathrooms very private. The hotel is located on a cute, quiet street but very close to anything you need in the West Village. The front desk staff and bell hops were extremely friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Thanks!;4
The hotel is very well located with a range of amenities within a 15 minutes walk form the hotel itself. Public transport is super with the Subway station (66Th Street, Lincoln Centre) been located directly across the way from the hotel. Times square is approx a 12-15 min walk and plebty of bars and restraurtants in the vicinity.  The room was small in comparison to european standards however it was clened every day, clean bedlinen and a range of toiletries supplied each morning. The only complaint with regards to the room would be the noise from the sir conditioning outside the window. We did complain to front of house and they moved us to a room with less noise however still annoying but better than before.  Staff were helpful and friendly.  I would recommend this hotel and;4
Older No frills hotel in the Wyndham Chain.  Rooms small clean and cozy. Overall facility works for business and pleasure trips.  Bar on sure. Starbucks directly across the street.  Easy walk to Times Square, thigh you might consider other properties that are closer and possibly less expensive..;4
We stayed at The Empire on the last night of our honeymoon. I felt that we were treated impeccably from the moment we arrived. The front desk manager introduced himself and we were treated to a room upgrade which was a really nice touch. The lobby and bar area were really nice, the cocktails were amazing and the room was very nice, and not tiny like most NYC hotel rooms. We went out for dinner and when we returned there was a complimentary bottle of champagne - which was a lovely thought. When our TV started to go funny - it was mended straight away.  I would have loved a bath in the bathroom - to enjoy the wine in - but apart from that I thought the hotel had charm and the staff were helpful and went above and beyond.  Thank you for making our last night a memorable one! Alex;4
I stayed here whilst attending New York Comic Con. It was a fantastic location being literally across the road from Madison Square garden, a short walk away from Times Square and a subway entrance just outside.  The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful even when we locked ourselves out of our room! Weâd had quite a few packages delivered to the hotel, these were easy to collect and again the staff were lovely.  The room was small but more than big enough for the 2 of us, it was clean and practical. The only downside was the water temperature in the shower had a mind of its own and frequently fluctuated. Other than that it was a great place to stay. I would defiantly stay here again;4
A really nice hotel in Hollywood. It is on a busy road, might be a little bit loud if you have a room looking to the street, but not sure about that as I got a room looking to the garden. The breakfast is good, you have pancakes, sausages, OJ, cereals, egg etc. Also some flat TVs on the wall to watch while eating. The room is big enough, the bed is perfect, the cleanliness is OK. New towels every day.  They also have a private parking area, but they charge $15 for a night which is a lot of many just for parking...  All in all, it is worth the money, I would recommend it :);4
This was my first trip to New York so this is my only NYC hotel experience. The hotel is well located next to main subway lines that can be used to access the entire city. Beautiful lobby. Very helpful staff. Good security at elevators. Two restaurants on first floor. Elevators were fast and during 5 days only experienced one elevator too full to board. I was on the 21st floor. Did not have a great view, other rooms were probably much better. Beds were VERY comfortable (not hard) and the AC worked well during the heat of early September. Only amenities were a flat screen TV and a hair dryer. Not a lot of room for luggage as the double bed room was small. No space for bath equipment in bathroom - recommend hanging toiletries bag.;4
Been 6 times now. Very clean. Nice and close to shops. They have now introduced a facility tax. Nothing on the web site Its yet another way of getting tax out of you. $25.00 a day plus yes tax. Beware this bumps your bill up Apparently its on expida web site    ALL BEWAREð°ð«;4
We stayed here for one night on the executive floor.  The room had a nice view and was average in size. We were disappointed that the executive floor did not provide any special perks, no happy hour or such.  The bed was very comfortable.  We were on a high floor (23?), yet at night we were able to hear very loud music for several hours and late into the night.  We are unsure if the music came from the hotel's ballroom or a restaurant/club by the park entrance.  We used the hotel's shuttle to get to universal studios, and that was quite convenient.  The seafood dinner buffet looked absolutely spectacular, including whole main lobsters.  We wished we would have known about this before arriving at the property.  We want to return just to dine at the buffet.  Looking forward to our;4
After reading many mixed reviews I was a little apprehensive on arrival.   On arrival we were advised that our two rooms had been upgraded due to my mums 60th birthday. The view was brilliant. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. The room was clean. A normal sized room for a NYC hotel room.  Our rooms were cleaned daily and we always had fresh towels.  There is a restaurant called Tik Tok in the same building. This is great for breakfast or a late night snack.  My only con with the hotel was that there were no hot drink facilities within the room. If you want a kettle there is a $25 a day charge. There is a Starbucks right opposite the hotel that is cheaper each day.  The hotel is within easy reach of time square a stones throw from Maddison square garden.  I;4
Easy walking to Empire State Building, Time Square, Macy's and the subway to 1 World Trade and Central Park is right around the corner. Building is older and shows it's age, but kept up with nicely. Rooms are small, but it sounds like most hotel rooms are here. My families first time in New York and we stayed 3 nights on the 30th floor overlooking the Hudson River and really never had a problem. The location is a huge plus. Tic Tock Diner on the corner and a CVS across the street open 24 hours. Walking back from Time Square at night felt safe and taking the subway around was really easy and affordable. Many options for parking nearby - I used bestparking.com and pre-paid with no issues. I would definately stay here again.;4
The rooms are huge well at least the suite I had was. Sprawling views of the hills and mountains along with the theme parks..  Excellent room service and lots of plush bedding. Shower was very clean and the room smelled excellent. Great place and a little pricey;4
We stayed at the Empire Hotel March 14, 2012.  This is a truly different and better hotel since their renovation.  Rooms are small but nicely decorated.  Front desk personnel friendly and helpful.  Excellent location for Lincoln Center.  The only negative is that in addition to the minibar, there is a pile of snack food and wines on the desk (for sale at minibar prices).  This is tacky. If you don't want this stuff in your room, they will charge you to remove it.;4
The location of this hotel is wonderfull, Central Park is just around the corner, Time Square is just a 15 minute walk, and a subway on the corner of the street. The people at the hotel are very friendly, except maybe the doormen for the top floor bar.  We received an upgrade for our room (as it was our honeymoon). The room was very spacious, but not that special. Prices for the hotel are rather high, but I think the location will make up for this.  When we stayed in the hotel, the pool was closed.;4
This was my second trip to LA but the first time I have actually stayed in the Hollywood area.  The hotel was recommended by business colleagues.  It was certainly good value and in a good location.  The hotel was part of the Ramada group but now appears to be independently owned.  Unfortunately, it still feels a little boring and corporate and is a bit worn round the edges - don't come here if you are looking for swanky luxury.  On the plus side the staff were very helpful and the price was particularly good given it's very central Hollywood location.  The room was clean, the bed comfy and the bed-linen smelt and felt unbelievably luxurious.  The best thing about the Hollywood Hotel is it's location.  It gave me the chance to explore Hollywood away from Sunset and Hollywood;4
The New Yorker is in a prime location to walk to all the main attractions. Walking distance to Times Square, Macyâs, Broadway, Chelsea Market, Little Italy and Chinatown.  You can store you luggage for free if you get there early before your room is ready and want to expire the neighbourhood.  It costs a small fee to store your luggage after checkout if your flight isnât leaving yet.  About $50 USD uber ride from LaGuardia. The room we had was on the smaller side and had an older character to it.  It was clean and had a closet, safe, hairdryer, and the bed was comfortable. Lots of places to eat (eg. NY style Pizza) nearby. Street food vendors everywhere including hot dogs and fresh fruit stands - at really reasonable prices. We only stayed 3 nights, so we wanted to be able to;4
Absolute amazing time staying at the new Yorker from the easy professional check in from miguel who even upgraded us to 33rd floor with a fantastic view of empire state building and Madison square garden. Staff all friendly and helpful lady in tick tick restaurant advised us were to go sure seeing etc and what subway to take.  A walk away from Penn station and a 5 minute walk to port authority.  Close to time square . I had a fab stay and will definitely be returning to stay at this great hotel.;4
The Hyatt at LAX is a comfortable hotel, staffed with a knowledgable, friendly staff who clearly make customer service a priority.   My only issue this that the walls seem very thin as I could hear my neighbors TV all evening and their talking.  I had a very early flight back to the east coast and was unable to get a restful sleep because of the sound.;4
You only receive the basic room, everything else you have to pay for. Extras like  anything at home you take for granted. We upgraded to a family room for the two of us and this was okay but it came as an expensive surcharge .It was worth it because we had a balcony looking down onto the streets. This enabled us to have a dink in the night air. I would recommend upgrading if you can. The hotel itself is referred to as 'Art Deco' I would refer to it as lacking in a refurbishment programme. There does not seem to be one individual in charge. They would benefit in my opinion of having a general manager. The hotel is clean and most of the staff are helpful. In saying all of this the best attribute of the hotel is the location. Just a couple of blocks away from Times Square which you;4
I stayed on a corner room, and the bathroom was very spacious and the rest of the room felt it as well.  The view of the CityWalk was great.  It is a short walk to the CityWalk, no need of a shuttle.  A pedestrian bridge crosses the road so its safe.   Plenty of parking.;4
We stayed here as we had an early entrance to Harry Potter at Universal Studios at 8am the next day. We drove here the night before and you even though you pay a little extra for secure underground parking , you can leave your car until 6pm on day of check out.  We checked in and took the free bus to Universal City from the hotel, it runs every 20 mins but when we the walked it, its a 10 minute walk too.   I wouldn't bother paying extra for a higher floor room the view isn't worth it. We had a room with two double beds, fine for one night for my girls to share and the room was plenty big enough .  Would stay again - nice hotel although check in takes a while - slow staff.;4
I recently stayed for a single night when I saw a performance at the Met Opera at Lincoln Center.  It was delightful to just walk across the street, particularly as I was traveling alone.  In the past I've stayed further away, and been a bit anxious about traveling alone after a show.  I arrived in NYC quite early (10:30 am) and I was very happy that I was able to move into a room as soon as I arrived.  I was surprised that the deadbolt lock in the door didn't work.  It was a bit unnerving.  The room itself was clean and comfortably furnished.  I never know whether to complain when the shower controls are so complicated that I can hardly figure them out.  Maybe it's just me, but the mulitple levers and dials and options were overwhelming.  I did finally get things all to work,;4
The hotel was very nice - easy self-parking, courteous staff, and numerous onsite restaurants.  The rooms were spacious and clean, and the shower was good.  The location is withing walking distance to Universal Studios and Universal CityWalk, and there's also a free shuttle.;4
We recently spent a full week at the empire hotel, booking two rooms to accommodate our 3 teenage boys plus my wife and I.  The best things about the hotel are:  1.  Location - within 2 blocks of Central Park, the hotel affords easy access to the metro system as well and is in easy walking distance of Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center. 2.  Ambiance - I enjoyed the old school feel of the hotel especially the lounge. 3.  Concierge - The Concierge who helped us was especially generous with his time and helpful advice.  This made our excursions into the city much easier.  The so-so: 1.  The rooms are small and one of ours didn't have much of a view. 2.  The pool on the roof is tiny...but heck...we weren't there to swim anyway. 3.  It is an older hotel. 4.  Everything is extra.;4
What a great value! Where else in NYC can you stay for under $200 a night?! I was skeptical at first but pleasantly surprised. We arrived at the Jane too early to check in so the bellhop (in a classic bellhop uniform) held our bags in storage. We explored the beautiful lower west side of city. The hotel is close to the subway and the staff can get you a cab in minutes. Cobblestone streets and quaint cafes and restaurants are within walking distance. When we checked in our bags were carried up to our room. I was again taken aback when I saw the size of the room. We had a bunk cabin. BUT it was clean with towels and slippers and a robe to use. And we didn't spend much time in the room. We were just sleeping there. Now the shared bathrooms are also something to get used to BUT;4
Clean and comfortable small bedroom, great bathroom. Just wish the lighting was better. The light bulbs were way too dim. Staff was friendly and the lobby bar is very nice. Location was perfect for our needs.;4
"It's hard to beat the location of the Empire Hotel in New York City, directly across the street from Lincoln Center, and a few blocks away from Central Park and Columbus Circle.  The staff was great from making reservations right through to getting our car from the valet. I had a big event nearby and had family coming in for it, and we all decided to stay at the Empire, and everyone was very happy we did. The rooms and bathrooms are somewhat small and the wifi was out for a little while at night - but the staff apologized and explained they were doing maintenance. The ""resort"" fee seems a little silly, but in general the price is very competitive for NYC, and for the location, great rooftop bar (a perfect spot for a small party after my event), and the fantastic staff, I know it";4
"It took me quite a while to write a review on this very beautiful place; I had to think things over as the overall service and the building deserves a top rating, however there were some very minor set-backs which would total the score at 9.98, not a full 10! In the end, I decided to be consistent with my general approach and only give five stars to a flawless experience although this one really got very close to absolute perfection. The location is great; a little on the outskirts of the Medina and yet quite a pleasant walk thru the Suq into the very center of Marrakesh. This old Riad comprises three different buildings, all beautifully restored, and a magnificent terrace where you can simply lie down in a sofa or have breakfast overlooking the roofs of the city; the staff is";4
Nice hotel in an excellent location. Very close to Central Park, Lincoln Center and Metro station. Nice staff, we would like free internet. Big room and good beds. Bad elevators and very noisy at night.;4
Location and transportation were excellent! Universal was a 9 minute walk from the hotel.  There was also a shuttle that came every 10 minutes.     The room was cleaned and freshened daily.  Guest were provided complimentary fruit infused water each day.   We were concerned about the elevator maintenance but everything ran smoothly with no problems!   Excellent stay in LA.;4
"The Midtown West Hotel is in a very convenient location, close to Penn Station, and close to coach buses stops like Go Buses and Vamoose. It is also very close to the Madison Sq Garden, to the Empire State Building and also to ""The High Line"" corridor with nice designed buildings and landscape . But all of that convenience is at the same time also an inconvenience due to the closeness to the 8th avenue which is a very busy traffic street and at night, it is a super noisy one! The windows are not sound proof so you can hear everything from people and cars! One feature of the hotel that could be an inconvenience to some people is that there is no elevator, so you had to carry the suitcases to the upper floors (the staff offers to carry them for you if you want it, though). The";4
Came here for the weekend.  So convenient to midtown theatre district.  Although no hotel restaurant, there were excellent restaurants nearby.  Room was clean and bed very comfortable.  Great shower.  Concierge staff were very friendly and helpful.;4
My boyfriend and I stayed two nights in a standard cabin at the Jane in late May.   Good points: - the shared bathrooms were lovely. The showers were powerful and hot and we didn't have to wait to get in  - while there isn't breakfast included, there is a cafe in the building which is pretty cheap and serves amazing avocado toast - towels, bathrobes and bottled water provided in the room - the staff were super friendly and helpful - the location is great. Near the highline, a subway station, plenty of places to eat and you can go running close by beside the Hudson - it was pretty quiet. We were on the fourth floor and weren't disturbed by noise at night at all.  Bad points: - the rooms were really tiny. Like, really tiny. If you have any bags then they end up taking up most of;4
Stayed 12th to 16th. No complaints. Everything was ok. Would stay here again but hopefully on a higher floor as the air conditioning  unit outside our window at the back of the hotel was very loud and had trouble sleeping. I developed a stomach bug while  there but it was nothing to do with the hotel. Great staff too. Very helpful.;4
This hotel is very well situated for visiting Universal Studios and there is a very convenient bus service back and forth also great to use this to go out to dinner at City Walk.  The hotel was well run, very nice service.  We thought it was very expensive but at felt better when the quality of the service and the comfort of the hotel became apparent.;4
We stayed here the night before flying home from LAX. Location was good for universal city walk but I'm not sure how far it would be from the usual sites you go to see whilst in LA. Room was nice - terrible view though (highway/freeway). The night we stayed we took the 10 minute walk over citywalk and ate at the Hardrock cafe - it was easy to get to from the hotel.  Upon check out we used the free internet PC they had in reception to do online check-in. This was a good idea for guests.;4
Great loction, however the views are not the best in some of the rooms.  The roof bar is great, but a bit pricey. The breakfasts are pretty terrible.  The staff were the most pleasant people I met in New York, they knew the city and restaurants well. The room was impeccable. The bar service amazing.  For location, price and service level I would stay here again without a shadow of a doubt.  The rooms are a bit small, but of a high quality. All in all, its like a Hilton, good, reliable and you know you will get the best service. Just avoid the room service breakfasts.;4
We stayed here for a long weekend and thought the hotel was lovely although the rooms were very small. The swimming pool is nowhere near as big as it looks on the website, it's more of a plunge pool, which was a bit disappointing as that was one of the plus sides for picking the hotel, but saying that, the roof terrace and bar was a great place to chill out late afternoon/ early evening after having done the sightseeing/shopping all day. There's also a nightclub which was very popular all through the week and weekend. Location was good for getting around though as it's just a few minutes to walk to central park or the nearest metro stop.;4
I stayed a total of  nights at the HH. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Room was warm, clean and beautiful with a descent sized bath. The check in, local travel information and check out were superbly handled by the Front Desk Supervisor, Elias. This hotel is located near the MRT. Hollywood attractions are just about two stations away. Breakfast was delicious and warmly served by the crew.   Thank You Elias and others at the HH;4
Large lobby, friendly staff, and lots of amenities if you pay for them.  It is a pretty hotel.  It would be great if I was going into the park.  As a business traveler, the size was not helpful as it took 10 minutes and 2 elevators to get on the road. Breakfast was excellent.  Internet was fast.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.;4
Having read the reviews prior to travel, I expected that some of the decor would be dated but in fact the main corridors need a major facelift.   Room was OK but we had to pay extra for a view and the bathroom was small with very little space on which to put toiletries.  The toilet flush was extremely noisy (we could hear the flush in rooms on either side of our room) and it took quite a bit of twiddling to get the shower at a reasonable temperature which wasn't boiling hot or freezing cold.  Floor in the bathroom needed a deep clean too especially around the edges. That said, the Tick Tock diner and the Trattoria were brilliant - amazing food !;4
Stayed here for a week from 23rd till 29th July and loved it, my first time in New York so I was trying to pack a lot in, Jasmine on front desk is a diamond...seriously!! I had multiple room card key errors when I was there, probably about 3 with cards strangely not working after a day or two, but nothing was too much trouble and I got a new one each time, rooms are very big and beds are very comfortable, and housekeeping was done every day, excellent location as its right next to 96th Street station which made it extremely easy for me to get to Times Square or wherever I was going and back again. Would definitely stay here again if I came back to New York!!;4
We stayed here in February 2016. The hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful. Breakfast was a bonus here and it was very good. Lots to choose from and again nice staff. The Metro was across the road which was very convenient we managed to travel all over LA from here. A few takeaways are nearby for late night food. The only downside was the homeless people in LA in general it was quite surprising. The traffic is horrendous and it takes ages to get anywhere. We would stay in the Hollywood Hotel again.;4
Fabulous location just across the street from Lincoln Center. Overall room was great, but bathroom was beyond tiny and had no counter space at all. Noise level from the street (we were on the 4th floor) made getting to sleep a bit difficult.;4
We scored a room at this wonderfully-located hotel through Hotwire and were expecting the worst when the very sweet receptionist told us the hotel was fully booked on Saturday night.   Room #1. We were not surprised to find ourselves in a broom closet-sized room shaped much like a triangle. The room was so small I used the fridge INSIDE the closet as a night stand. To get inside the bathroom you had to step inside the shower. We are not large people but . . . We found much to laugh about but the real kicker was the fact that our queen-sized mattress had been placed atop a much smaller frame making sleeping along the edges precipitous. The lobby of this hotel is pretty and interesting and almost impossible to see because someone kept the lighting at 1 candle power. Silly.;4
Love the location and my room had a fantastic view of the Chrysler and Empire State.   Room was a good size with two Queen beds and nicely decorated. The corridor from the lift to my room really needs a refurb as the carpet was a tad worn and didn't smell as fresh as it could have.   The lobby does get very busy, so, allow extra time for checking out, or, any enquiries where you may have to go to the front desk. The staff work flat out to process people as fast as they can.   The gym is on the lower ground floor, pretty well equipped with loads of space.    Inhouse deli also useful.;4
"I didn't think that the room was too bad in terms of size as I had heard all about the rooms in New York being small.  The bathroom probably could do with a more modern make over.  Fantastic location right near Central Park and a shopping mall in front of Colombus Circle.  Nice roof top pool and roof top bar which is the ""in spot"" in Manhattan.  The down stairs bar is a great place to hang out as it is not a sleazy bar (some hotel bars can be very sleazy). The bar staff are all amazing - so extremely friendly and sweet and really interested in getting to know their guests. I cannot speak highly enough of Gerard, Frank, Mike, Nyahale and Sandra.  Concierge is fantastic and provide you with great tips of what to do and what not to do in NY and will do all the bookings for you.";4
Had a 7 night stay in May 2015 and chose due to proximity to Central Park (where we were getting married). We initially booked a junior suite but managed to obtain a free upgrade to the king which was very spacious compared to other rooms. There was still no free coffee in the room and mini bar was charging $3 a cup and $8 for bottled water. The pool bar on the top of the roof gave fantastic views but be warned that a service charge is added to the bill before giving any tip to the bar person. The pool is also the size of a large bath! There is also a bar/club that is accessed via a lift in the hotel entrance open to non-guests of the hotel. The location is close to Columbus Circle subway station where the number 1 train can be caught and there are also plenty of bars and;4
I stayed at this hotel for a work conference in May 2015. The lobby was inviting and room I stayed in was large and well presented and I had a lovely view of Universal Studios. The bathroom was huge and clean. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well. There was free WiFi in the room and lobby but not in the meetings rooms. My allergies flared up in the room - not sure what this was due to - carpet or air con? The breakfast served in the dining room downstairs was very nice and I ordered room service a couple of times and the meals were great. There is also a small gift store (with snacks & drinks available) downstairs. The elevators were being upgraded while I was there so sometimes there was a 5 min wait for an elevator. I found the hotel staff to be helpful and courteous.;4
Our room was upgraded by the nice staff person who checked us in, and the corner executive room on the 23rd floor was big and quiet. The hotel needs some updating as the elevators were definitely slow and one seemed broken and the wall paper in some areas was peeling. We enjoyed our stay and I appreciate the professionalism of all the staff I encountered.  WiFi was free!;4
"So I read many of the reviews about rude customer seevice, and excellent customer service, and moldy musty rooms, and clean fresh rooms, and I wasn't really sure what would happen when I got here. It's a HUGE hotel (2500 rooms) that is 75 years old, so I wasn't too sure what I would get. When I first checked in there was a line of people waiting to check in and another customer service rep poked his head out of the office door, but instead of quietly stepping back inside and ignoring the problem he immediately came out and started helping people. Then when I checked in I asked if there were any larger beds available than a queen, because I'm 6'1"" tall so I didn't want my feet hanging over like another reviewer. Without hesitation he upgraded me to a King bed with a view of the";4
The front desk was courteous. The bellmen were very attentive and helpful.  The room was clean.  There is no in room coffee pot but downstairs they had coffee hot and ready all the time so that was no issue.  There is no ice on the floor, but a call to the front desk and a bucket and ice is delivered as a courtesy so this too was just fine!  I had an enjoyable time and the room is a decent size for Manhattan.;4
The only complaint is the internet service.  If you are staying here and need internet serviceâ¦.look elsewhere.  After 26 days of staying here over 6 months, we have NEVER had reliable internet.  In fact, it rarely works.  Seems an easy fix???;4
We stayed here for two nights with our two teenagers while visiting Universal Studios and enjoyed our stay greatly.  We loved being able to easily walk to Universal Studios, or take the free shuttle bus which runs every 20 minutes or so.  Our room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  We had a nice view of the Universal Studios entrance and City Walk, which was beautiful at night.  The double beds were soft and comfortable, and bathroom had a nice shower head with varying settings.  We were a little surprised to find an older standard definition TV in the room, but that didn't really matter to us.  The only minor confusion was how to self park as you need to register first to get your room key prior to entering the parking garage.  There are other hotels which are more centrally;4
"i stayed in a 1-bedroom booked through hotwire. the apartment was quite large (by nyc standards), clean and well apportioned with new furniture and amenities. compared to the similarly-rated hotel i stayed at, the tempo was fabulous.  on the downside, the apartment had a strong food odor and the advertised internet access wasn't accurate. turns out they only have it available in the 16th floor ""business center"" which costs 10 cents a minute. the rooms could have benefitted from extra towels and blankets for guests staying more than 1-2 days.  all said, i was pleasantly surprised at the tempo's excellent value and will recommend it to friends seeking an inexpensive option in nyc.";4
We stayed 2 nights with my wife in September 2017. We did not choose to stay in Los Angeles due to heavy traffic. Hyatt Regency is right next to the airport.But you do not hear aircraft sound..Room large and comfortable. Ä°f you have car, There ara a lot of car park near the hotel. Sunrise car park was very cheap.;4
Perfect  location. You are able to walk pretty much everywhere (we even walked to Battery Park etc, although I would not recommend doing so in the august heat!!)  Across the street from Madison square garden and a few bars. Minutes from times square or the empire state. A few blocks away from Hells Kitchen. You must check out the High Line as this is also not far.  Clean hotel which has friendly and helpful staff. The lady on reception upgraded our room to a room with a view, we didn't ask she just did it for free.  The bed was very comfy. Room small and basic but did include wardrobe space, draws, iron, ironing board, hairdryer and safe. The hotel charges $2 per bag if you need to store them prior to check in or after check out.  The hotel can book you a private taxi to the;4
My wife and I stayed here whilst staying in New York and it was a great location or our visit with only a couple of issues. 1 was the fact that only half of the elevators were in operation although we did receive a letter with an apology, although we felt it could have been sorted before with regards to the hotel being full due to the dog show at Madison square gardens and a lot of people staying here also with dogs. 2 we had a blocked toilet 1 day and I phoned for this to be resolved about 10.30 am and when we returned at 6.45 pm it still hadn't been sorted and we both had to have showers as we were going out to see the Eagles at 7.30 and there was a smell plus poo in the toilet, and somebody had picked up our clean the room sign and turned it over to say do not disturb but;4
We stayed here for 5 nights during a recent vacation. The bed and linens were great!! Location was ideal for getting to see the most common tourist attractions. My most favourite part of this hotel was the doorman Jeff, he was incredibly attentive and so friendly.;4
Our beds were comfortable and the rooms were GREAT! The hotel was close to everything we wanted! The only complaint would be that we smelt wakey backy quite strong on our floor for 2 days we  asked the doorman to get us a tax to the airport i he said yes for 85 dollars we also asked in the hotel information  and they said they could get us one for 100 dollars  ...;4
Rooms are a bit stuffy but huge for Manhattan hotels.  Bathrooms tiny. Front desk helpful.  Great location.;4
They call it cabin and actually it looks like on a boat. Big enough, if you only want to sleep, but if you need to work in the room, forget ist. There is a shared clean unisex bath room on each floor, the staff is very friendly, the bar serves good food and even bavarian beer. So, not  a lot to complain about. The neighbour hood is the meatpacking district, one of the sizzling areas in Manhattan.;4
My 24-hour stay, for a meeting, was extremely pleasant, and fully up to what I have come to expect from Hyatt Regency. Formerly a Radisson, one of the Dining Room Hosts from the previous occupant came to my breakfast table as soon as I was seated and welcomed me back. That was a very nice touch.;4
We recently stayed at the Empire Hotel for 6 nights. Because we were staying a while, we opted for the junior king suite room - and we're really glad we did..it was a great room with plenty of space!  After busy days in the city it was nice to have the space to relax in the comfort of your own room..so if you're staying more than a couple of nights I would definitely consider this.   The staff were all really helpful and friendly - a few things weren't working in our room but someone came up really quickly to put them right and the staff on the door were helpful too - getting us cabs etc.  The bar and lobby area is really nice too (expensive for drinks but such a nice setting) and the rooftop bar is also worth checking out.  The location is good too, we didn't want to be right;4
I stayed with my husband for 6 nights and had a great time. The hotel was a great location as it was easy to get almost everywhere - well as easy as LA driving is. It did take us a while to get to the airport however we left the hotel at 7am so expected it! The hotel is walking distance from Universal and City Walk so no issues with food, shopping, etc.   The grounds are lovely and the hotel is kept really clean and had a friendly, warm vibe. I loved the dÃ©cor and every member of staff was so friendly and really lived up to the sunshine state name. The fact that they had a starbucks on site was great if you are jet lagged :)  The room was fab and we had a great view up on the 17th floor. We had everything we needed in the room and the bed was AMAZING! I could have stayed buried;4
I stayed for one week in Riverside studios and can honestly say I did not see any bugs or rodents. The double room was large enough, the maid came in every day and left clean towels and soap, the bed was clean and the floor was vaccumed. It was not a problem sharing a bathroom as it was empty most mornings when I went to shower. The staff were friendly and helpful, we were able to leave our cases at reception when we checked out and collected them later.  The only downside to this hotel was the fact that it is an old building and in need of renovation. The room we were in was noisy, as the hotel is close to the Main Road. I felt safe in the area and after speaking to one local resident I found out that there are a few celebrities live very close.  If you want somewhere clean and;4
The room was a good size for the amount of time we were there. But the bathroom needed some more attention to the details. There was no coffee or tea included with the rooms, neither was WiFi which was a shame. There was free WiFi in the lobby but if you wanted it in the room it was an extra charge, which was a bit disappointing especially with the cost of the hotel.;4
Room was very nice.  People very nice.  Prices are very expensive but figures because of location.  Standard breakfast for two was $55.00.   Parking also expensive.  Doorman Tim super great person... Summer time..lots of kids..;4
Check in and check out went very smooth.  This hotel is directly across the street from busy Penn Station and a short walk to the shows on Broadway, shopping and food options.  It's a very busy area so be prepared for crowds.  Security checked for key cards before allowing anyone near the elevators so that was an added level of safety we appreciated,  We stayed in an older section of the hotel that wasn't renovated yet and the mattresses definitely needed replacing as they were too soft.  That was my fault as they were clear about it up front and I tried to save a few bucks.  Next time I'll pay the extra $10/night and stay in a renovated room so my back doesn't ache when I get up.;4
Extremely well located hotel very close to Penn Station. We only used metro twice. Once for 911 memorial and other time for Brooklyn Bridge. Other than that everything was within walking distance. Staff at front desk very helpful. Rooms perfectly adequate and clean. Views over the city amazing. Beds so comfortable. thank you New Yorker;4
"This hotel fits the bill for an easy, efficient stay in Hollywood.  Literally across the street from Universal Studios (an easy walk or free shuttle ride), the Hilton offers convenience and comfort.  The rooms and beds were comfortable and clean; the bathrooms were spacious; the views were lovely.   Free breakfast is included with Hilton Honors elite status, which felt like excellent value.  Self-parking in the garage cost $30 and was easily accessible.  Aimee at the front desk was especially friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend for a Universal Studios visit.";4
Even though my room was small, it was clean and very accessible by train and restaurants. It's located along the main thoroughfare, so it's not scary to walk at night. However, it's still not safe to walk on the street in wee hours of the night in major cities in US.   The breakfast was good, but after a couple of times eating the same breakfast, it became boring for us. They never changed their menu during our 5-night stay in the hotel.;4
Stayed for 2 nights before a cruise from Long Beach and was pleasantly surprised by the modern and clean feeling of the hotel.  From the moment we checked in staff were friendly and professional, we had booked a room with access to the Executive Lounge and a view of the Airport. Unfortunately both of these were disappointing. The room was large and clean and bed provided a comfortable nights sleep. Ate both evenings at the bar downstairs and food was reasonably priced and good. Shuttles to the airport were frequent and transport to Santa Monica and Venice beach with a ride share was easy. Would definitely stay again but not with access to the lounge or with a specific view in mind.;4
I stayed here with a friend for 6 nights. We were on a slight budget and got ourselves a double room with a queen bed. This was absolutely fine for 2, but we found that the room was a little cramped and there wasn't a great deal of space for 2 large suitcases.  The breakfast buffet (included in the room price) had a great selection and we made the most of this every morning to set ourselves up for the day, on the waffles, sausages, eggs, toast, bagels, fruit......  The immediate area around the hotel is not really ideal, but since we had hired a car, this allowed us to get around very easily. The hotel is very well situated. Very close to the Griffith Observatory, Hollywood Blvd, and the Farmers Market. Its also just over 1 hr to Santa Monica and Venice Beach.  Its definitely;4
We booked this hotel through a BA package deal. We read some bad reviews on the hotel which put us off but as the deal was such a bargain we thought we would give it a go. Turns out we didn't find anything wrong with the hotel that was being said.  The hotel is very clean, rooms are comfortable and modern.  Roof top bar area if great but a bit pricey.   Hotel gym is a good size for what you need when your on holiday.  Location we found was ideal for experience the full city.  Staff were great for giving you local information.  The only issue was the air condition, during our stay it was very hot and humid and the air con didn't really do anything.  Your in NYC so your not really staying in your hotel for long periods of time but when you are this hotel was ideal.  Overall an;4
Our stay at the Empire Hotel was good. We were out most of the time so I don't have too much in the way of critique for the hotel. First thing, if you want a room with a view then don't book into room 105, nothing to see here folks! Also the air-con units outside,on this side of the hotel, are very noisy.We expected this after reading other reviews, so we had ear-plugs with us and they done the trick. That's about the only negatives though. The beds are very comfortable. The shower is superb, although the floor does end up very wet because there's only half a door on the shower! I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The hotels location is excellent, easy walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, Times Sq. and the shops on 5th Avenue!! Would I stay there again? all;4
If youâre looking for the best hotel thatâs closest to LAX, look no further than The Hyatt Regency LAX. Excellent accommodations, staff and food and wonât break the bank! I stay there once a month when in town for business.;4
Great location for getting around New York. Hotel was a little tired looking we had a Queen room which was a little small for 2 adults, but was in a good location and experienced no noise which was a bonus. Restaurants on site were good and convenient and the information desk team knowledgeable;4
"Corner of 8th Ave and West 34th Street, access to all subways, within walking distance of everything; Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Empire State Building, 42nd Strret, Theater District, Restaurant Row, Off Broadway Shows, Koreatown, Penn Station, and more!  Easy subway ride to Little Italy and Chinatown.   Hotel is a landmark, being over 100 years old. Rooms are small, have been updated and are nicely decorated. Great views for my room on the 28th floor. Hotel has a rooftop bar which overlooks Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Rooftop bar was closed for renovations when I was there and will reopen in the spring. Add the rooftop bar to the list of a very New York experience. The New Yorker Hotel lobby area is quite impressive and is elegantly";4
Really like the breakfast, the chef can make eggs any style for u. The pancakes and waffles are very tasty too. The parking in the gated area is very costly, but you can park by the road side by entering quarter into the machine.;4
"Book this place ahead! It has lots of quirks (I'll list a couple of them below). It has a nautical theme, including portholes on the hallway doors (but not room doors) and ""cabins"" instead of rooms. The ""standard cabin"" (which I stayed in) is tiny but cleverly designed. The Hudson River is a two-minute walk away; a walking/jogging path lined with park benches and lawns is an even-quieter escape than this quiet hotel. Another great place to visit is the High Line, an aerial park that starts two blocks away... next to the Whitney Art Museum. There are lots of galleries and restaurants around that area. It's a ten or 15-minute walk from the nearest subway station (8th Ave at 14th St) but it always felt safe. Or the bellman (yes, there's a bellman... in uniform, like the rest of the";4
While I didn't use the hotel for traditional hotel services, the staff is very friendly and helping. Nice bar area for viewing sporting events. The Hotel is right on the grounds of Universal Hollywood. Very nice views and outside seating areas,as well as pool area.;4
I liked the Wyndham hotel, because is near of principals turistics points of New York. The room was good and clean, about breakfast, so you are in New York then you should find out a place for eating natural food.;4
Hotel is great, clean tidy and in a fantastic location.  The only thing we would say is that the facility fee is expensive to be charged per night.. but as this a standard charge of the hotel you just have to pay it.  The location is great 0.5 miles from Empire State one block from Macy's. 10 min walk to Times Square would recommend, just bare in mind the city tax, New Jersey tax, facility fee and leisure fees that get added to your final bill.;4
The hotel was very conveniently located near the Lincoln Center, great restaurants, walking distance to Central Park. Staff was friendly and helpful! I will stay there again when I return for work. Restaurant next store was excellent!;4
Stayed here for 5 nights as a birthday treat.  Hotel has tried to keep to all the original decor and yes it does look a bit dated in areas and could do with a coat of paint but that is part of the ambience of the building.  For a city hotel I wasn't expecting a huge room and it was perfect for my needs.  Yes, it could have done with coffee facilities in the room, but as others have said there is a Starbucks across the road. The only thing I would say they could improve on is check-in.  There was always a queue when I passed through the foyer.  The staff could be a bit more helpful on the desk.  The people in front of me got all the advice they needed, I got- 'here's  your key and this is the Wi-Fi code' The concierge and door man were very helpful.   Tick tock diner only used;4
Nice view. Room not ready for occupancy. Nice rooftop bar with excellent service. Lobby bar pleasant.  If you are going to  a show, symphony or  ballet at Lincoln Center this is a good choice. What more do you want.;4
"I've stayed here a lot, and sometimes you can get really good deals.  Not having free internet is annoying, and the entry staff is poor; the front desk, however, (Nick in particular this time) is lovely.  Rooms are great, but when the deal is good, don't expect a view of anything but an airshaft.  in the center of everything, restaurants are fine, but midtown expensive.  very hip, young, cool vibe (of little interest to me---I don't even know what hip is anymore..";4
We just completed a four night stay for Thanksgiving.  Hotel staff, from bellman to all inside staff weâre extremely helpful and friendly.  I need to highlight Sherpa for some special help he provided me in getting some ice.  He is a wonderful person and impressed me in his willingness to go out of his way to help me.  Our room was smaller than expected (741) and somehow we ended up with a smaller bed than what I thought Iâd reserved.  All worked out fine.  Our son and daughter in lawâs room was larger with the king bed.  Both rooms have the same design flaw.  When closed there is very little air circulation possible from the HVAC unit.  With the thermostat on the wall and very little heat or AC impact with curtains closed, the HVAC unit runs non- stop, no doubt driving up;4
"I stayed here last week â this is a very nice hotel, clean, spacious rooms & lovely large bathroom with excellent shower. I was greeted pleasantly & felt safe & welcome.  Because Universal Studios park is closed (Covid), the hotel had a very deserted feeling.  The gift shop is only open on weekends. There was a doorman on duty, but nobody offered assistance with bags, etc.  Iâm sure their staffing is less due to Covid.  Also, I wish there were more food options in the eveningâ the one restaurant is high-end, full meals; it would have been nice to be able to get large salad or lighter options. Breakfast was delicious, with really great waitstaff. Overall, a nice stay, Iâd like to return when everything is open 100%.";4
I have stayed in the Ameritania hotel on my last day of traveling in NY. I have booked the wrong room, the staff was very friendly and updated me to a better one with discount. They have allowed me to drop off the bag without any payment why I was using my time to go around the city. Majid and Sedik are great, super mood, great vibes, and always positive energies are coming from them. They try their best to help you. When I've checked out of the room, accidentally I've left my passport in Room. When I got back after 4 hours, Found out that they have found and kept my passport for me.  The building is old and furniture needs some update, but when staff is so good, these bad things do not matter. I Will go there again definitely;4
We chose this hotel because we wanted to go to Universal Studios located at 15min driving. The pool is nice and the staff very nice and helpful. The price is fair but in case, ask for the renovated rooms. They are the same price but nicer.;4
cmon ppl I don't what all these negative comments are about but I had a great stay;4
"Review by professional couple aged mid-30's from UK.  First time in NYC.  Very simple to book with Woogo on their website with freephone number from UK.  Apartment was approx. 11' by 11', clean and comfortable (you are only sleeping there!).  Small but not dubious staining on bed linen; comfy bed; no bedbugs or roaches; some fittings need revamping but should not affect your stay; fridge; microwave; large TV with 100's channels; closet space; medium sized ensuite; plenty hot water and towels.  Very conveniently situated on W 73rd / Broadway (out of 73rd Street station, turn right at next junction, just past the Tempo church on the LHS); two blocks from Central Park and Dakota Building; lots of food shops to the north (6am till 2am supermarket that does preprepared food); quiet";4
We stayed here for two nights when we visited London to watch a show at the Apollo. The location was superb! Short walk to venue/underground and bus services. We stayed in a twin room with shared bathroom and even though our room was opposite the kitchen, noise wasn't an issue. At the end of the day this is a hostel, not a suite in the Hilton! The room was clean and modern and the shared toilet and shower facilities were also clean and tidy and we're visibly cleaned every morning. Check in/out was quick and painless and the price was the best we could find in the Hammersmith area for the days we were staying. Would deffo stay here again when attending another event. The main and only let down is the charged wifi as Â£1 an hour is pretty steep! I understand it's a big building and;4
"Although IÂ´m not completely convinced that I will come back to this hotel, specially in the summer, since I was not aware that the rooms were not air conditioned. We stayed in a private room (captain cabin with a private bathroom), the room is pretty nice in itself, although it was pretty noisy from the rooftop bar. The bed and all the amenities were great, the location is unbeatable if you want a ""cheaper"" stay in the Chelsea neighborhood.";4
We stayed in a family terrace suite for one night.  We were supposed to stay longer, but I had called a week before to change the reservation.  The person I spoke to said the confirmation number was the same.  I should have called back to make sure everything was set.  We arrived on Friday night after driving around for 2 hours looking for parking (see below) and the man at check-in said they had expected me the night before and that since I was a no-show they had given my room away.  I was shocked, and told him that was not the case.  In the end, he found us a room and we were all set.  I wish I remembered his name, he was very kind.  The room itself was very nice.  The suite we were in was on the 35th floor.  There was an entryway, a huge walk-in closet, a bedroom with 2 beds,;4
Location is perfect for walking to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and most theaters.. Subway stations close to the hotel make visiting Central Park, the Met, and 9/11 museum are an easy subway ride. Lots of eating options from steakhouses to street vendors are in close proximity. Our only issue was housekeeping. Getting 2 washcloths (2 people in the room) daily was an issue and one day she left her used coffee cup in our room.  Jeff, the doorman, was fabulous. He took  care of our luggage, arranged for our return car to JFK, provided easy to follow directions and always had a smile and greeting. I would stay here again.;4
The hotel is very located, on the eight avenue close to the main point of attractions (Times Square, Madison square garden and Macy's). The room are a bit small and the bed as well. It was a double room.  The bathroom needs some renovation but it is all clean and nothing major. What I didn't like was on the time of check in, the lady asked for my credit card. I asked why she was requesting for it as I had the reservation fully paid. She just responded to me that it was the hotel's policy to take a deposit of usd 45 on the time of check in. I told her that I was not informed about that police on the time of booking and she just looked at me and said it was the hotel policy. She was a bit arrogant. I think that it shall me made clear this policy so that we are aware when arriving;4
The hotel is very nice, charming, and modern. There is a restaurant and lounge/club on the rooftop. The location is phenomenal, steps away from central park and columbus circle. However, the rooms are very small! I stayed in a superior room and still felt I needed more space. But, the rooms are decorated very well and are cozy.;4
"The hotel is in a great location, close to Penn station and the best of New York City. The hotel is very safe and my room was super clean and modern. I stayed in a queen suite and I couldn't be happier with the room. It was big, comfortable and quiet. On the negative, the hotel seems to nickel and dimed you throughout your stay, starting with a ""daily facility fee"" of $29 and ending with a charge of $2 per bag for storage after checkout. As long as you understand and you are ok with the fees (and they are clearly disclosed in their booking engine), this is a great place to stay in Manhattan.";4
Lovely location, great sized room for nyc with 2 double beds, a little tired but better than I was expecting for the price. Good bar. Lots of restaurants near by. Supermarket and Starbucks downstairs. Nice 15 min walk along Broadway to Times Square. Would return. Hotel arranged car back to airport $70 inc tip made it cheaper than a yellow cab and was a lovely huge gmc black truck.;4
"We were welcomed at Ameritania, especially by Majid, who was helpful and kind and assisted with the accommodation and transport. Very central location; good, clean rooms with excellent showers. Very good value.";4
We had six adult women staying in one room.  It was a bit cramped but the view was really great.  We were on the 39th floor.  Two dbl beds in the bedroom were a bit tight for adults and a queen size sofa sleeper.  Price was reasonable since it was split among all of us.  The room was clean and comfortable otherwise and a great location for midtown.  The staff was helpful and courteous.  Check-in would have been much faster had I checked my email and known keys were waiting at the rewards desk.;4
Hyatt Regency LA is located close to the airport and is the kind of hotel that is well balanced and decent on all the attributes that I seek. This property is small (as is the case with Hyatt Regency). The service at the reception is warm and swift. In fact the staff in the lobby are quite co-operative and do their best to make your stay comfortable. The rooms are spacious and done well in hues of white. White is the central visual theme of the hotel. The beds are comfy, the washroom is compact and I liked the space planning. The only restaurant I dined at was Unity LA, and the food there was good, however service is a bit slow. Overall this hotel is a great pick for you if you want to be near the airport.;4
"Great location and well maintained. Rooms are spacious and views from upper level rooms can't be beat. Only negative was the hot tub was out during our stay and the ""heated"" pool was pretty cool, as well.";4
My wife and I stayed here for a Christmas in New York getaway weekend.  We enjoyed the location and the history of the hotel was pretty cool.  Outside of that, the lobby had a smell when we checked in due to heavy rain, but it went away as the weekend went on.  The room was small which I guess can be expected.  We were right at the end of a hallway by the elevators but surprisingly it wasn't that loud.  There were other signs of the building be old but overall you could tell they were doing the best with what an old building will give you.  Our stay was pleasant and relatively comfortable.  However, when we come back we'll probably look to stay somewhere else.  We'd stay here again if there weren't any comparable options.;4
This hotel is conveniently located in the heart of NY. The staff were overly helpful and friendly.;4
We booked a 1 night stay in November as we were coming in from a cruise for two days. We chose the hotel because I am a huge gossip girl fan and my partner didn't have a choice once I realised you could stay at The Empire! Due to the bad weather out at sea we were only going to make it into New York the day after I had booked the hotel for, I sent an email to the hotel and they very kindly rearranged our booking for the following day which I very much appreciated. Upon arrival at the hotel the staff were very friendly, I hadn't realised I had booked an inside room but the staff on reception offered us an outside room which looked out on the street. There were renovation works taking place but nothing that affected our stay. We went up to the roof top bar which is much more;4
Hotel was comfortable and clean.  Close to subway station.  Cafe's and restaurants close by. European cafe (hotel gives out breakfast voucher if required) on other side of Broadway supplied a very good breakfast for $6.50.  Staff helpful and courteous.  Quiet location. Would definitely stay here again.;4
Pleasantly surprised with how nice hotel was.  Location was great, not far from all major routes, we had car and 2 mins walk to subway. Rooms were really clean, although slightly dated but not something that bothers me. Pool was really nice, although didn't have much time to use it, the standard of equipment around was exceptional. Breakfast was free and was really nice, although as I'm gluten free was disappointed at no options, omelet were really nice. All in all nice hotel.;4
I have Just returned from my trip to NY and I have got to say that I enjoyed myself at Morningside Inn. The service there was very good. I was greated with professionalism by the front desk staff. They made me feel comfortable and glad that I picked that Inn to stay at. All my question were answered especially when I asked about places to visit, which made it easy for me to get around and enjoy some sites. The rooms were very comfortable and private. If ever in NY again, I would gladly go there once again for my stay.;4
We stayed in this hotel last week (week ending 22/04) for 5 nights. After reading the reviews about the size of rooms we booked a twin bedroom which i would recommend because these rooms looked a lot bigger. We found the staff friendly and very knowledgeable about the local area. The room were very clean and comfortable. It's in a quiet area, with bus stop and subway really close by.;4
stay in this property for 4 nights. it is an old hotel so room is very small good enough for overnight sleep. if you think you need to spend lots time in the room then I will not recommend this hotel.  location is great next to Penn Station subway. Many restaurants within walking distance. one 24/7 restaurant is in the hotel property convenience for breakfast . McDonald and Starbucks just across the street.   Time square is 15 minutes walk. By the way, my room have a prefect view of Empire State Building .;4
Stayed on the 39th floor and we had a very good view of the manhattan skyline. Room was dated in terms of AC and TV but nonetheless a comfortable sleep since we were only staying for a night. Thereâs a CVS pharmacy right beside the hotel and you can even walk to madison square garden and times square under 10 minutes.;4
The location of the Abercorn House is ok. A underground station is an about 5 minute walk away. The rooms are nice and clean. The only thing to complain about is the staff that is a little unfriendly and the extra cost for Wi-Fi.;4
Would I stay again? Yes. Location great. Room ? Well if u are used to 5 star then no but comfortable and clean yes , water so hot though and bath fills real quick!!  The road noise is loud but amazing at same time. 5$ to store bag upon check out although 12 pm check out so thatâs a bonus! .  We walked everywhere. Amazing central location. We did 9 11, Empire State , Central Park, high line, Brooklyn bridge, Times Square , Hudson yards all on foot !we did do a private transfer 90 dollars with no hassle to hotel. Text them for a return trip. Tick tock diner was fab. Drinks are average 8$ a beer and 12 $ a wine or cocktail. We found Irish bars have happy hour 5 a$ a drink . Lucyâs across from hotel does happy hour 4-7 . Macys 6-7 min walk . We walked about 27,000 steps a day but we;4
We Stayed there for 5 Nights Loved this hotel When we checked in straight away we got a upgrade to room with a view  The cleaners were in the room every day  Hotel was a great location we also got a late check out we will book into this hotel when we come back to New York;4
Nice rooms , great breakfeast buffet , the chef HUGO will take good care of you , he is a star , speak Spanish English French Japanese  and makes the best omelets . Very well located if you're going for touristy trip, swimming pool is of decent size and pictures are pretty accurate.;4
I stayed at Hotel Hollywood with my best friend, we were there for 8 nights, we were lucky enough to score an amazing deal which was stay for longer than 5 nights and get 50% off if you're from overseas, so it ended up being amazing value, but even so the hotel was amazing, clean, great breakfast every morning, definitely worth full price.   The only minuscule thing would be the location, it's not really walking distance to many places, but with that said it's super easy to get a cab/bus/shuttle which the staff were more than happy to help with.;4
The New Yorker is in a great location, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, 2 blocks from Macy's and a 5min walk to Times Square and Theatre District.   The staff are very friendly, you need to show hotel room swipe to get up to rooms. The rooms are very big in size and very clean. Beds are very comfortable.   We were on the 35th Floor, view was great and couldn't hear the traffic from street.   Heaps of towels. I wish the rooms had a bar fridge in them.   Next time I am back in New York will stay here.;4
This is a solid Hilton property with up to date, clean rooms and public areas.  Friendly service by all employees encountered.  The shuttle to Universal was very convenient and ran every 15 minutes.  Parking is $30/nt but this is to be expected for LA.  The Diamond F&B credit is $15/day at this property which didn't even come close to the cost of the breakfast buffet at $28.  All around a good property and I would return.;4
Clean, conveniently located, excellent service, this hotel provides very good value for money, and my wife and I will be back.  The rooms on the 7th and 8th floors are the only ones, as far as I could gather, that have been completely renovated.  Rooms on the other floors can have very small bathrooms, and the living space can be quite small as well. No guarantee that requests can always be met, but it would never hurt  to request the 7th or 8th floor and to ask specifically for a larger room.  Our experience was that the staff was willing to go to some trouble to accommodate.;4
The hotel is very clean .Facilities are great aside from the washing machine which you have to pay and cant use without coins for a tourist like us would be an issue as you need to have lots of coins to use it.The staff are of great help.anyway specially Cecille who is very friendly and accomodating and will definitely help you with anything. Excellent staff service;4
Not a newer hotel but what you would expect at this price.  Clean and roomy with friendly and helpful staff.;4
"Actually, location is perfect, you can reach any sites in very short ways, as by walk nearby as by subway in upper / lower Manhattan)  The room size, esp. bed size - are to be re-checked very carefully before you book the room, on the sites everything looks with a little different dimensions...For two persons with luggage there is no space in the room to walk free... and first Hotel for me with no refrigerator in the room!  In general the hotel is comfortable, the view from window very depends of room location, it will be or window to window view in case you get some ""internal"" room either the great view from ""corner"" room we got on 37th floor))  One strange thing we mentioned- permanent food smell in the corridors especially in the morning, probably due to not perfect";4
If youâre coming to New York to stay in the heart of Manhattan, with Times Square a 15 minute walk and the empire outside your window - then this is the perfect spot. Price wise itâs a cheap deal, the rooms are pretty poor and basic. But the bed is comfortable and youâll get a good nights sleep. You cant swing a cat in there so I can imagine the basic rooms would be a bit of a squeeze for two of you, but really itâs all you need for a city break. Spend your money on more important things like shows and going up the rock!   Enjoy :);4
Christmas stay.   Rooms were clean and comfortable and most of the staff we had involvement with were excellent.    A plus was that for such a busy hotel, there were seldom any waits for the elevators.    The pool was closed during our stay and the pool at the nearby Sheraton was made available but I can't see that many people would want to traipse over to another hotel (not that close) to use their pool.    We ordered room service three times during our stay and were pleased with the food and service every time.   The walk to Universal Studios is short - about 10 mins at a leisurely pace.   There is also a shuttle which runs frequently.    There is an odd jewellery sales area in the hotel lobby - a man with tables set up displaying jewellery.  The sundry/gift shop was;4
I've stayed at this property 3 times this year and have been pleased everytime.   If your business takes you to the studios this is an ideal location. If your trip is for pleasure and you plan on going to to Universal Studios look no further. This is your place.  Location: See above. But, be aware that there is precious little else in the immediate vicinity of Universal Studios. To be sure, a 15 minute drive can get you to a ton of good restaurants, but the area immediately adjacent has little to recommend it.  Restaurant: I've only had breakfast but it was a very good (if not inexpensive) buffet.  Staff: Good folks. Always helpful. None of the artificial snootiness one can find closer to Beverly Hills.  Room: Clean. Comfortable. Air conditioning works. Endless supply of hot;4
We stayed at the New Yorker when we visited NYC for an event at Madison Square Garden, which is just a block away from the hotel.  Check-in was easy, the staff helpful and attentive and we liked having the Tick Tock Diner right in the building.  The room was typical NYC small, and not an elegant room, but it met our needs.  For example, the bathroom woodwork was chipped and the tile covering in the tub was old, but everything functioned well.  It could have been better cosmetically, but didn't affect our stay.  Overall, the decor was nice - retro design throughout the building, and very comfortable.  I liked that there was always someone checking to see that everyone had a room card/key before they could enter an elevator, so the security was visible daily.  We also took some;4
My boyfriend and I stayed here the last week of March for four days. We mainly picked this place because we got a great deal on Orbitz for around $100/night. The rooms were clean. The location was ok. Even though the hotel's parking gate and security made me feel safe it's still not an area I'd want to walk around late at night. It is close to the red line metro to get to downtown LA, Universal and Koreatown easily and to avoid traffic. However, you should still rent a car. We drove to Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Parking is $22/night including tax. The best part was the complimentary breakfast. The made-to-order omelettes and waffles were fantastic! I'd recommend if you find a similar deal.;4
Location, location, location.  This gorgeous historic hotel puts you in the heart of midtown, with easy access to the Theatre District, and other points of interest.  The subway entrances were just around the corner, and Penn Station/Madison Square Garden just short block down.  As a tourist, I appreciated the security measures the hotel used and the cordiality extended by the staff.  We ate at the adjoining Tick Tock Diner and had happy hour at the adjoining bar, for pleasant and convenient meals after the theatre.  As a tourist, visiting NY can be daunting, and the availabliity of tourist-oriented services such as the The Big Red Bus or Gray's tour lines with easy on, easy off, increase the enjoyment of our stay.  The business center was great for printing our return travel;4
We stayed here for 2 nights while visiting universal studios. We had a room with 2 doubles. Comfy beds and a nice quiets room. The kids loved the pool and the free hot pop corn that you could bag yourself was a huge hit! If you want a chair at the pool get there early, there seemed to be a few bday parties going on, so busy! There is a free shuttle bus to universal which was great! Esp coming home after a long day at the park.;4
Jeff is an exceptional doorman when leaving , he had an airport ride on standby for us at 6:45 am before he even started his shift! All the staff were helpful and friendly.  All the doormen assisted with an elderly guest in a wheelchair  who was in our party.   Great location . Many amenities close ( Starbucks / bars / reasonable casual lunch spots etc.) .  You can walk wherever you want to go in the Times Square and surrounding  area .;4
We stayed at the Empire for 4 nights in July 2011. I was slightly apprehensive about what were going to find as a lot of reviews on here weren't great, but there was something about the Hotel that I still liked.  I have to say we had an amazing stay. Staff are friendly and efficient, decor is lovely although a bit dim, but I guess that is the effect. We had a room with 2 double beds, it was well furnished and we had plenty of room, We didn't have a view on NY but that didn't bother us. The bathroom is really small, but I can cope with small as it was spotlessly clean which is more important to me.  The pool deck is a lovely place to lie and have a well earned rest from all the sight seeing, The pool is tiny!! so much so we didn't bother to use it. The view from up there is also;4
Stayed here for 6 nights to celebrate my birthday and received a fantastic reception as well as a bottle of bubbles in my room when I returned from discovering New York for the first time which was a wonderful surprised. I have to say Housekeeping deserves major acknowledgement for their hard work and quick response to any requests.  Friendly staff all around which made it feel like home. Some thicker duvets would make the beds a bit more cosy in my opinion as well as fuller pillows however these were minor issues. The shower was a bit odd though and had some leaks but also a minor issue. Would consider coming back if the hotel had a revamp and had a refurb for their utilities.  Also, location was FANTASTIC, Central park a stone throws away and Times square a few minutes down;4
I stayed in The Jane Hotel with a friend, as we didn't book in advance we stayed in the only rooms which were available, on the first night we shared a double room with a bunk bed, and on the second night we had two single rooms. Over all of stay was fantastic, the place has real character, the rooms are designed to look like sleeper cabins on the old orient express, the one downside of the hotel being that they are sized this was as well. But for a two night stay the limited space is fine. The bathrooms were shared, and even though this worried me a little at first it turned out to be no problem. We never had a problem getting in to use the facilities or take a shower. Now for some info on the shower, it was hands down one of the nicest I have ever used. All the rooms have ipod;4
"Is a really well kept Hotel in Los angeles/Hollywood. Near Metro station, so for those in a really tight budget (or who wants to spend the most in fun lol) is a great help. Also close by is one of the Observatory shuttle stops (weekends only) so dont forget to pay a visit there!.   The Continental breakfast was great, but is the only meal possible!. No restaurant service for the rest of the day, altought the room had appliances so in case of a quick meal, just a visit to the nearest restaurant or Kmart to m-oven later.  My only real complaint: the ""free"" internet service was awful, almost never worked. Just a few moments in late night or in the morning. So if you are planning your trip ""on site"", keep in mind this, so printed flyers become your best friends lol.  Besides that,";4
We stayed for 5 days, we had a queen size bedroom which we were expecting to be a bit bigger than it was, but that was OK considering we didn't spend much time in there.  Rooms were clean and so was the hotel.  Man on the check in/check out desk could have done with a smile on his face. Also got funny at the fact I was paying for my stay in cash, not sure why that was a problem but the manager came over and sorted that out.  When we arrived also we had a few bags, would have been nice if someone offered us a hand to bring them in or up to the room.   There was a lovely man called Jeff when we were checking out who took care of our bags and loaded them into the taxi for us and also found out where our taxi was when it was late turning up!;4
I feel like I can pretty much count on being pleased with the rooms at Hyatt regencyâs.  They are generally more spacious than the usual hotel room and the bathrooms are elevated beyond the standard big box hotel (see pictures).  I always appreciate a nicer shower. The location for this hotel was pretty close to the airport, but you still need to take a shuttle to get there from most of the terminals.  The hotel runs shuttles to and from the airport pretty frequently though so I didnât have to wait long at the hotel. There was a bit of a wait at the terminal though originally. The lobby was fine, and there were a couple fast dining and and standard dining options it looked like.  I was there for a conference and it was convenient for that. The meeting rooms were convenient and;4
Family trip to see New York.  Great location, close to everything!  Only problems were how slow the staff at the desk worked - our group waited over 1:30 checking in and getting keys for the rooms, how hard the beds were, and the party that was going on next door one night from 10-1 a.m.;4
The lobby and bar are very nice.  My room was tiny, but clean and modern. I had a view of Lincoln Center.  Great location as it is near Lincoln Center, the park, subway, Columbus Circle, Broadway, etc.;4
We stayed for one night with a toddler and a huge dog on our way from San Diego to San Francisco. What a great find! Located right in Holywood, not the most glamorous locale but central. A beautiful little pool area and plenty of parking.   The rate was amazing and we were close to our friends in Hollywood and Silverlake and close to the freeway.   Free breakfast too!;4
Stayed at the Empire last week. It was clean, nicely appointed. Very small. It was just me on a one night business stay. I had a queen bed. It would not be enough room for two people. Great bed. First class linens. Plenty of elevators. Starbucks and a Duane Reed were right there. Central Park is a 5 min walk away. Great location.;4
We stayed in a double overlooking the Hudson. The room was small but romantic and beautifully decorated with old-fashoned wallpaper and furniture. The bathroom was newly renovated with turn of the century features but still comfortable. The only problems with our room was the heat (too warm) and the lack of a mini bar.   The location is excellent! Especially for all the restaurants and bars in the Meatpacking district but it's also whithin walking distance of the Village.  This is truly a hotel with history and a style of itÂ´s own and you won't find many like it! The rooms are perhaps not as comfortable as in other hotels within the same price-range but if You value personality and atmosphere the Jane is an excellent choice! The cafÃ© and the stunning bar are also nice features,;4
Good location - only a block from Penn station and walkable to most of the cities attractions.  Its an older, historic hotel and that shows through in the rooms.  The beds are nice, and the rooms are a good size.  The bathroom was older but had everything you need.  It has a big & nice gym, and the lobby and common areas area great.  For the price and location, it was a great value.;4
We arrived early after an overnight flight from Hawaii, exhausted.  Room not ready, ok no problem we expected that, but felt the reception were really stroppy with us and they could have been more pleasant and tried to give us a more informed time as to when it would be ready rather than the standard line.  Room fine, small as expected, bathroom needed a bit of a refit really.  Reception also tried to charge us the resort fee, even though my confirmation clearly stated that this was not applicable for travel Jan-Mar.;4
Built in 1929 this hotel has all the marking of a classic hotel.  The room while older are neat and tidy and relatively large by New York standards.  Staff were all very pleasant and helpful and the location couldn't be better.  Within walking distance of the Empire State and Times Square it is in the busy Garment district and close to many of the core shops.  I would definitely stay here again while in New York.;4
We stayed for 2 nights to visit Universal Studios and for that purpose alone, this hotel is excellent.  A great location - easy 10 minute walk up the hill to Universal, a shuttle bus also runs regularly if you aren't up to the walk.  The rooms are well appointed - typical Hilton - however in need of freshening up as they're looking a bit tired.  The elevators were very slow with only 3 in service, due to works being undertaken on the others.  Lovely pool area.  Nice lobby - a bit on the small side for the volume of people passing through and staying at the hotel.  Great food selection and the most extensive breakfast buffet we'd ever seen.  We only had the continental selection and this was more than adequate with a good fresh fruit, yoghurt and the usual bagel, bread and;4
We only had a one day stop-over at Hollywood Hotel, and with a tight scedule we did not have the time to explore all the hotels facilities - but both our room and the parking facilities was a positive experience. First of all we were impressed by the very helpful and service-minded staff we met at the hotel desk. Professional and at the same time friendly.;4
I found this hotel very welcoming. The room was small but adequate. We had 2 bathrooms, one at either end of the room. Rooms are kept clean and tidy with towels changed daily if you have used them.  All staff were happy to offer information even if that meant telling you that something could be cheaper to buy elsewhere.  I like that sort of honesty. The restaurants attached to either side are of variety and both excellent. If you ever go to New York but don't stay at the New Yorker then visit the Tick Tock cafe as I can assure you that you will receive the best french toast with Nutella and banana ever!  My biggest regret is that I only had it once. This hotel is ideally placed for access to anywhere within New York with Maceys and the Empire State just a five mins walk. Times;4
We booked this hotel as part of a package deal to go to the Universal Studios Hollywood park as well as a base for us to visit Hollywood landmarks and some of the studios.  The package included self parking which was a great deal as it is normally ($20) a day and it also included two breakfast vouchers per day.   We are a family of 4, so we paid for two kids breakfast while using the vouchers for the cost of the adult breakfast.  The room is very clean and we had no complaints.   We also had a view of the park from our room as well as the mountains.    The park is about a 10 minute walk or you can wait for the shuttle bus to take you to Universal City-walk, which comes every 20 minutes.;4
Big thanks to Lionel in security for promptly sending me the tablet I left in my room. It's people like him that make a stay somewhere memorable! The hotel is nice, clean and feels trendy. Like many hotels in NY its on the smaller side but I'm not someone who needs a big room as I'm hardly ever there.;4
Wonderful stay.   One of the better hotel stays we experienced. Desk staff very friendly and helpful, Door man terrific! We have already recommended Ameritania to business associates and  will continue to do so.  Thank you Ameritania for making our NYC stay relaxed and enjoyable;4
We stayed at the Empire at the beginning of our 5 week holiday to the US.  Hotel is situated in a great location - close to Central Park and with easy access to Broadway and Times Square. Plus point - concierge staff (Yuri and Chris) were an enormous help before arrival with recommendations for restaurants and help with booking to see a show (Avenue Q - a must!).   Negative points - our room was small but we made do as we were hardly there.  Putting two double beds in the room made it cramped and there was very little space to put our luggage and unpack.  Bathroom also very small.  Lumpy pillows! However saying that when your in New York who wants to stay in their room!;4
Hubby and I stayed here for an overnight in NYC.  I was a bit nervous about a hotel so close to Penn Station.  However, it worked out beautifully!  The building is a truly historic NYC site.  Definitely, visit the bottom level to learn more about the building's history.  The Art Deco building has retained its style and history.  All the staff we dealt with were friendly.  Our room was small, but it was all we needed.  It was modern and clean and gave us a place to sleep at night.  The location worked out well for midtown activities.  We walked a TON while in the city, and we were able to walk to everything we did from the New Yorker.  Didn't need a cab or subway for anything.;4
We stayed twice during May. On our first visit a warm welcome greeted us on our arrival after our flight from the UK. However our room was not what we expected and so after a quick word we were looked after by Majid who ensured that everything was well organised for us during our time there. Majid assured us that on our return the second visit would be a bit special. It certainly was special with a very large comfortable corner room at the top of the building with wonderful New York views. An excellent end to an excellent holiday. We have stayed in this hotel three times now and we plan stay here whenever we return to New York. The staff are all wonderful and eager to ensure you have a great stay. Thank you.  We will be back.;4
We booked 2 rooms with two double beds for a day at Universal Studios. We were able to check into 2 rooms that were next to each other. Location is the main reason I choose this hotel.  It is only 5 minutes walk to the Universal Studios or you can take the free shuttle if you want.  Room is clean and comfortable but watch out for the housekeeper.  Since we have 2 rooms at the same time, we noticed that some of the items were missing.  One of our room doesn't have the TV remote, the charger cable and the can opener.;4
Yes it is sooooooo close to Penn station. Yes it is in walking distance of so much. Yes walk to dinner and Broadway. Yes Madison Square Gardens is a stones throw away.  Yes we got a room at 9.30 in the morning which was lovely because it was freezing outside.  Yes there was a workable hairdryer in the room without asking.  But the room was tiny. The desk and chair really didn't fit in the room as the chair got in the way all the time.  No coffee making facilities but apparently you could ask.  Ok so we had a fun stay because it was oh so conveniently located.  Yes it is in the process of being refreshed.  Yes it is great Art Deco.  But the shower was hopeless.  In fact it was so pathetic a weak squirt that I couldn't face it in the morning.  So I put off having a shower for 3;4
Was a pleasant stay but refurbishments were going on which made it feel not as grand a place for the money.  make sure you really checkout local shops as hotel very expensive to eat there and food not wonderful and room service dining was shocking.;4
We stayed at the Jane for 4 nights in the bunk bed rooms because accomodation in NYC is pricey so for price and location this was a good deal. The hotel staff were always very helpful and a lot of services were offered including fast WiFi, room service from the restaurant downstairs (breakfast, lunch, dinner), rooftop bar with an amazing view of the Hudson River.  However, the room was TINY. Which would be okay for people travelling light but if you're an INTERNATIONAL traveller like us with 2x large suitcases each..you couldn't even fit one large suitcase in there. It was a pain, but atleast they provide secure storage downstairs for it. We had to spend time rearranging bags and only keeping what we needed for the 4 days with us. The shared bathroom is clean- 2x showers and 2x;4
"Growing up around New York I had some low expectations of the ""quality"" of the hotel but was pleasantly surprised by the location and cost of the hotel. I looked into spending my spring break with my girlfriend and it was a perfect week. Though the beds could have been firmer and the rooms were a bit drafty at times, I would recommend this recently renovated hotel to the tourist or the weekender. For a romantic time with all the bling of New York head to the Waldorf, but for a comfortable stay without too much hassle stay here.";4
"Just have to say that there was a issue or miscommunication in the booking of our VIP client during our event and when they were leaving the hotel. Gerald was able to work his ""magic"" and help us out so the client was still well taken care of. Thank you Gerald. You saved the day!!!";4
This hotel was very nice.  The room was small but we really were not in it so it was not a problem especially for the price.  everyone we worked with here were fantastic and very helpful!  Was a great hotel for a weekend away!;4
As you would expect in New York, my single room was tiny. It was clean with a good sized closet. The shower has only 1/2 a door, which saves space but means the bathroom floods when taking a shower. Unfortunately, I was next to the elevator and was kept awake by a cell phone user. I did not see a coffee maker, but a Starbucks is right across the street, and the location is perfect to see a Broadway show (why I was there.);4
The hotel is placed in the center of manhattan, with the metro station at a couple of metres away from the door, so it's perfect for a NY visit.  All of the staff I had to deal with was great, professional and kind. The hotel is a bit old maybe, but everything was clean and well maintained, the only downside probably was the room, clean, nice but a bit tiny. I would return in this hotel;4
"I had a good stay at the hotel. Parking was convenient and I could easily access my car any time I wanted; something that is nearly impossible in Los Angeles. There is a small parking fee fyi. The hotel is very beautiful inside and out. The room was in the second floor and it had a King bed. The only thing about the room I didn't  like was the fact that the room didn't have a carpet. So at night the floor was a little too cold. All around I had a great experience and would definitely return if next time I'm in LA.";4
This this is definitely your place. I've stayed there on three separate occasions and I must say that the bad reviews on here are unfair. Chances are, if you're looking at hostels, then you know that they aren't like hotels. If you compare Hotel Riverside with the Hilton, then of course, things will be unbalanced. But this a hostel, nothing more or less, shared bathroom and small rooms. But things are clean, it's quiet, you get a good nights rest, and the price is affordable. I've never seen or felt any bed bugs during my stay, the bathrooms were always empty when I needed, and front desk people are nice and personally walk you to your room. I'll continue to stay there when I visit because I'm always on a budget. For the price, things are pretty nice.;4
My office recently booked me at the Wyndham near Penn Station. It was a good location but when I realized The Wyndham was the old New Yorker Hotel, I was a bit skeptical. The New Yorker had gone down hill and I thought it had closed after serving as headquarters for a religious group.  However, when I arrived I found the hotel totally renovated. It's a large hotel but I found the front desk personnel very helpful. I arrived a little before check-in and they didn't have a room but when I told them I needed to change to get ready for an event, they were able to arrange it. The room itself was lovely, totally renovated with a new bathroom and flat screen television and up-to date decor.  The location is great, near the theatre district, subways and TIme Square. The one issue I had;4
Spent 4 nights here in February 2020 - was hoping for snow but got none..! Very very cold though.   Whilst room was small, it had everything we needed and was always kept clean and tidy. Herself used the hairdryer and found it great. I have a bad back and find sleeping in hotel beds a bit of a lottery but the beds in the Ameritania were perfect for me. Not too soft but not hard either. Shower was amazing! Rooms were also very quiet. We didn't hear anything from outside or neighbouring rooms.   Location was perfect for walking to Times Square or to Central Park. We never used the subway so can't comment on that. We did buy a 48 hour pass for the Gray Line bus and this was fab. We did the four bus tours plus the boat trip and also used the bus to get around New York.   On to Jeff;4
Mine may not be a fair review. My room was a queen express. Very small quarters, but clean. I assume other rooms are larger. Overall, everything was rather dark. The bathroom was difficult to navigate, but everything was in working order.  For me, when visiting New York, it's more about location than accommodations. As long as everything is clean, I'm not fussy. The Empire Hotel is close to Central Park, and about 12 blocks from the theater district. Here is what I would say about location. If you want to be near Central Park, this is the hotel for you. If you are seeing a show, you may want to be closer to the theater district. Establishments near the theater district and Times Square appear to remain open later at night. The closer you are to Central Park, the harder it is to;4
Pros: The closest hotel to Universal Studios Has a few restaurant options Bell hop is great to store luggage if you're going to the parks Nice-ish  Cons: Went in January, the lobby and restaurants were freezing.  We had to eat fast to get back to our rooms.  It is very surprising they haven't found a way to solve that. Older-ish.  It's glory days were were a few decades ago.  Verdict: We'd go again for a Universal Studios stay.;4
Can't argue with the location (short walk to Universal Studios, short drive to Hollywood and downtown), or the room which was massive and comfortable with a great bathroom.  Price for room was pretty good and they were able to extend our stay by a day (you will need time to explore LA).  Only downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access.  Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras, but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn't avoid them due to crcumstances.    Breakfast was nice and reasonably priced (extra to cost of room)  Overall, pretty good, just a shame they feel they have to rip off tourists who need to make urgent calls.;4
I went in this hotel twice, last summer and in January. I liked it a lot. For those who don't have a car, there is a metro subway five minutes walking from the hotel. It brings you to the Universal Studios, Hollywood Blvd, etc. The breakfast is so tasty, there is a great choice of food. I just couldn't understand people complaining about it. (They must be too fussy!). I'll definitely go there again and again every time I'm back to Los Angeles!;4
We were greeted by Mr Ze at check-in. He provided warm, friendly service with a room upgrade for our family of 3. We'll be enjoying the rooftop deck/pool and will definitely plan a return to the Empire!;4
Let me start off by saying that this hotel is really a terrific place â especially for the money, but if you are staying over a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night be very careful!  Unbeknownst to me (or Iâd never have booked this place) they run a night club downstairs on those nights.  If you have a room that overlooks Jane Street good luck sleeping.  Even with high quality earplugs the vibrations will keep you awakeâ¦until 4am!    I did complain and got moved to another room the next night with a small refund of 15% on one night for the inconvenience.  I was very close to moving out entirely, but they found me a better room and things worked out ok.  Speaking of the rooms, I doubt Iâd return if I didnât get a Captainâs Room.  They are quite spacious and very comfortable.  The;4
Stayed in the junior suite. Room was very nice but was a little smaller than I expected for a suite. Also, the fridge in our room did not come stocked with anything (bottled water) like it said it would be. Overall the stay was great. The rooftop bar was very nice and all of the employees were excellent. I would come back to this hotel;4
Checked in late in the night as my flight was canceled at Newark.  Staff was great and accommodating, I was quite impressed.  I was put into a room on the first floor.  Room was nicely appointed.  The hand spray on the shower did not work, but that wasn't a big deal.  I attempted to open the curtains but noticed I had a view of the alley/AC unit for the building.  The noise of the AC unit outside the window was quite loud and a bit annoying.  Location was great, staff was excellent, specifically Romeo at the front desk.  I would absolutely stay here again, just get a room on a higher floor.;4
So our stay was good. While I get that it is an old hotel. It does need some updating. The bathroom was an icebox the draft from all windows was terrible. We had to have the heat on full. But the staff was friendly and approachable. The cleaning staff do an amazing job, we were happy to leave daily tip. The ice machine on our floor never worked. Also it would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room. The bath faucet spewed out brown water until I let it run. All in all Iâd give it 9/10. For convenience to surrounding area.;4
My family and I stayed here for one day this week after spending a few days in Anaheim. We chose this hotel because of the price and location for one night.  Our room was clean and quite comfortable. The full breakfast was good and Sonia was very friendly. The courtyard was a little small but looked like a great place to relax. I would stay here again.;4
It really is like staying in a ship's cabin but the shared bathroom is clean, the showerhead strong and the location not to be beat. We had a really good time and loved everything about the hotel - the staff, the common spaces, ease, etc. Only down side - coming back to the Friday/Saturday night very young drunken crowd disco party scene.;4
A very nice staff, clean rooms and the best bed ever. Air condition worked great and was much needed. Only minus about the rooms was that there was no key to the bathroom. Location in west Hollywood was OK, and if you had a car it would take you roughly 1 hour to get to the beach, and 10 minutes to walk of fame... We were very happy...;4
Very happy with our stay at this hotel. Mackenzie was very kind at the front desk. Great location. Nice rooftop bar. Nice views. Close to the subway. Near Lincoln Center. Had a nice buffet breakfast.  Will return here.;4
Great location, super friendly and helpful staff.  The only thing which detracted from the overall experience was that the bathrooms are a little worn around the edges, and the restaurant was closed so no room service.;4
Probably the best breakfast of the LAX hotels. Dewayne in concierge makes any day trip you have planned very easy with different options of how to get there with different budgets, super helpful and friendly. Anything you need is met with a helpful response.;4
Hotel is very central - easy to walk to most places and very close to the subway. Decor is dated, however, my room was clean and had everything I needed.  The check in and check out process can be quite time consuming depending on how busy they are, but in general, the staff are really helpful.;4
I have been here several times and always find my time very pleasurable. The bed is comfortable and the food is spectacular especially the weekend buffet tho' I did not indulge in it this visit. I will return again gladly in one year for my conference. My single problem was with the shower. The head was pointed toward the wall  causing me to have to squash against the wall to get wet. This was pretty inconvenient when I banged my head on the wall but not life-threatening. One other little irritant. I pre-confirmed my room expecting to pick up my key and immediately adjourn to my room. However, pre-confirmation had no advantage over the usual registration process. I still had to go to the desk, fill out papers to register before I could go to my room. Again a minor issue but the;4
Been to better, been to worse, very old fashioned hotel. Italian restaurant attached very good. My main gripe is that when you check in, Â£120 was taken from my bank account using my registered credit card, I understand that, but it's been a week since we checked out and the money has not been returned yet.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker for 4 days over thanks giving, and we're very happy with the hotel.The staff were all friendly and welcoming and we found no queues at reception with a speedy checking in and out process. We were given a room on the 26th floor and could see the top of the Empire State from our window. The lobby and entrance area at the hotel is amazing, but the hallways to your rooms are looking tired and are due to be modernized. Our room was fine and comfortable and large enough , again it could do with being updated now but I think that's part of the charm. I would stay here again if we returned to NYC, as its nearby all the sights including Macy's and Times Square.;4
Spent 4 days at the New Yorker and found it to be a very pleasant hotel within a great location. Room size was more than adequate for a hotel in a prime location. Furthermore the views I had from the room were fantastic. Undoubtedly I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.;4
I stayed here one night in February in between flights. This hotel is extremely convenient, the shuttle to/and from the airport is super easy and comes frequently. The lobby and amenities are nice (good restaurant, gift shop, etc). The room was modern, although room 800 had some water damage, peeling wall paper, and visible wear and tear on furniture, it made me do a deeper look for cleanliness. However, all-in-all it was a great option for LAX hotels, and I would stay here again if I needed to catch an early flight.;4
We stayed at the historic New Yorker for a couple of days for Independence Day. This was a good value in a central location. We had two rooms, with one in a renovated section. Both were typically Manhattan style small but very comfortable. Small local food finds were great, as was the convenient 24-hour on property Tick Tock restaurant.  Everyone on staff at the hotel was exceedingly pleasant and helpful. Mohammed of Customer Service and the Front Desk was particularly charming and knowledgeable. It was evident that he took great professional pride in the hotel. He not only anticipated our needs but surprisingly remembered us even with all the holiday guests. His warm welcomes differentiated this hotel with style! We plan to come back!;4
I booked this hotel out of desparation since every other place was either booked out or selling at a ridiculous rate. Then I found this hotel. Looking at the pictures online I decided to pay for a premium room, and what a difference the renovation made... I got a newly renovated room that looks quaint and modern - nowhere near the horrible 1970s pictures posted online. The gentleman at the front desk was extremely welcoming as well and it was a pleasure speaking with him after a long trip. You get what you paid for, that's for sure, however once they finish renovating the entire building this hotel can be a gem.;4
$25 Valet and crummy self parking lot is not a good set up. Pool is nice and staff is excellent. Food options are current. Rooms are nice and current. Updated and style and food. Some airport noise but windows are double pained to cut noise.;4
Everyone was very friendly. The contemporary decor falls a little flat. The entrance kind of felt like a less expensive budget boutique hotel. Not what I usually expect from a Hyatt Regency hotel.  The restaurant had a good buffet with nice cheese, croissants, a variety of egg dishes. The restaurant staff was great. The room was contemporary and spacious enough. The bathroom had a really silly sliding door but everything else was nice and comfortable. Well stocked with toiletries and one robe and slippers. The staff was super accommodating and nice.;4
Me, myself and I went for a quick theater jaunt to Greenwich Village first of this year. The Jane kept popping up. The moment I arrived I had a smile on my face. The employees dressed in vintage French hotel uniforms were polite and efficient. I chose the single berth room for $79.00. ($99 ttl. Unheard of in Manhattan) Funky as can be.I am 6'2  228 lbs and the small room 50sq ft was just as they described and pictured it on website. Comfortable bed similar to a Murphy bed. Shared bathrooms immaculate. Again as described and pictured on website. Checked out the captains quarters 250 sq ft  king or queen for $250 was perfect. The room I saw was  nicer than the one pictured.      Cafe Gitane, so French chic, food four star and the staff fantastic once again.    The Ballroom Bar is;4
Close to Universal Studios, comfortable with a great view! Park is within walking distance, but bring your inhaler if you need one, cause it is mostly uphill. OR use the complimentary shuttle that runs every 15 mins (not avail during early entry to Universal times). Skip room service meal and eat at Three Broomsticks!;4
My decision to stay here  was based on the location near the subway line a ride away from midtown. I enjoyed walking Broadway and Riverside park . Last time I stayed in Queens and it was long ride in the subway. You are paying to stay in a safe neighborhood blocks away from Columbia University, I really can't say much for the amenities of the room when you have the city so close. It  was a convenient and cheap place to crash, that's it. Patrick, the manager was helpful and friendly finding a car service to the airport. I be coming back.;4
Location is fantastic, right next to southwest at terminal 1. Great for layovers. The free shuttle service is inconsistent and the drivers can be very rude and if you don't wave them down they will drive by you, even at the hotel lobby.;4
Stayed at the empire hotel manhattan, great location! Friendly service,  Jose in particular was extremely helpful and went the extra mile for me! Couldn't recommend the hotel and Jose enough!  Will deffo stay here again!;4
We stayed here for 3 nights (21-24 June) and can thoroughly recommend this Hilton. Room was spacious, clean and bed was comfy.  Good base for exploring the LA/Hollywood area if you have a car.  We didn't eat here but the food - and particularly buffet - looked excellent.     Parking pricey but that's how it is in Californian cities.    We would stay again.;4
Stayed at the Ameritania from the 30th of April to 4th of May. Great location, rooms were clean, all staff members were very helpful and friendly. The one issue i have with the hotel is that there did not offer coffee to guests, there is supposed to be a coffee station at reception, but during our 4 night stay, no coffee was available, just tea bags(1 type of tea) on the one day with no sugar or milk, I mean come one this is the 2018 and no coffee or tea, even the cheapest hotels in South Africa offers that, and its not like the Ameritania is cheap, although compared to other hotels in the area, it was the cheapest option when we booked.;4
If you like character then this art deco hotel is for you. Some people seem to think it's tired. Wrong. It's a beautiful recreation of period art deco which quite rightly doesnt have the bling appeal of modern boutique hotels. We had a twin room which was very spacious, had two bathrooms and was well equipped. OK, we didnt have a terrific view but I dont really expect that in city centres. The tick tock diner is exactly what you expect in NY, with huge portions and attentive staff. If you like sport, book room 2549 which is the room Muhammed Ali stayed in after his classic 1971 fight against Joe Frazier (the hotel should make more of this). Central location, plenty of character and relaxed atmosphere. My only small criticism would be the limited choice of draught beers in the;4
We stayed here with a group - we had about 15 rooms and they were all great. All were well appointed. Some were on the small side, others were a little roomy and had 2 closets and 2 bathrooms! They was such a pleasant surprise - especially in an old hotel! There are rooms with great views of the Empire State Building as well (though most don't have these - many of us had views into each other's rooms!) There is a good diner, the Tick Tock, on site, or a coffee cart in the corner of the lobby if you want to grab something and go. There are plenty of restaurants and drugstores within steps of the hotel for convenience. And Penn Station and the subway are across the street to get you to anywhere you want! Plus the Theatre District, Times Square and the Empire State Building are all;4
Whilst initially we thought the hotel was expensive we soon realised the proximity to the sites,shops etc this saved lots in extra cab fares. Amertitania hotel met all the requirements and made our stay of 8 days a welcoming refuge after some very long days. Jeff became our favourite doorman and greeted us each day with such care and attention to how we were going.we valued his care and attention to us.Javier was a super bar man  and looked after us with such professional care and grace.;4
After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant, however for the price paid the value is great. If you want the ritz pay for it! All of the staff where friendly the room was clean the only problem been the air conditioner was very noisy. Tv in room worked well. Housekeeping put fresh linen on everyday and did a great job. Good place for subway station as itâs just at the end of the block.;4
Adequate accommodations and pleasant, helpful staff. Great location for a Lincoln Center area stay. We did not like the first room offered us but were very satisfied with alternate room offered. We look forward to return stay.;4
Rooms being decorated, which helps, but poorly done with paint on new soft furnishings. Small rooms, lovely beds though. Great location near Lincoln centre. I love the Empire, but it can do better. Some staff brilliant. Its got  a unique vibe.;4
Even tho I DON'T have anything bad to say I was really happy with the upgrade we where given. Only flaw is if you take your kids take a Birth certificate. Because not only the host, manager and waiter will ask for kids age in the Dining area. It's not much for kids over 5 years of age, only $30 wich I suggest to pay because I was bothered that they kept asking me. My son ate FREE cause of his age. BUT QUESTIONING US 3 TIMES WAS OBSERVED..;4
My daughter and myself stayed at the Wyndham 4-9th December 15. It was my treat for her 40th birthday.  First impressions of the hotel was a bit disappointing as there was a lot of scaffolding around the lower floors but once inside the foyer it was lovely, A beautiful art deco hotel. Check in took a while but I guess a lot of fights from all over arrived at the same time. We were dealt with and given our room details etc. I had requested a room with a view if possible and was very pleased to see we looked down 5th Avenue straight to the Empire State building. The room was not overly large but I was prepared for this. Bathroom was a bit small but all perfectly adequate. The furnishing was good and the bed very comfortable.The houskeeping for the room was spot on. The staff were;4
The Hotel Nice and friendly staff, great breakfast, pub in the evenings, souvenir shop, pool area, big parking with automated gates. The area outside the hotel didn't feel like something we wanted to explore by foot so we used the car every day.  The biggest downside is the very expensive parking fee of 30 USD. There are parkings on the streets outside so if you're ok with finding your own parking spot and walk to the hotel you got some big savings heading your way. There is an ATM at the hotel which charges 5 USD for withdrawal. Water automats on every floor.  The Rooms Great beds and good daily cleaning. We did not like the shared pathway outside our balcony door, although we rarely noticed anyone out there. Also the entry to the shower was way to small for big sized persons.;4
Good location.Its easy to find the hotel,and the subway is just 4 blocks away(Columbus circle,or Lincoln sentre) Short walk to Central park,and the start of midtown. Good bed,but a tiny room. The prices of the bar was too expensive. A nice friendly staff.;4
Right on the park, very clean and comfortable. Rooms are really small but one wouldn't spend a lot of time indoors in NY city, I assume! Friendly staff, great location, good price for a hotel so centrally located.  Wifi was not free - only downside.;4
My daughter and I stayed here for 8 days over Xmas and we loved it. I'll start with the staff who will go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.  Cris on concierge was the best though. He helped me with bookings for various things like ice skating prior to travelling to NYC even calling me 4 times in one day to make a booking for me!  We stayed on the 9th floor and never had any disruption from upstairs bar. Rooms are a little small but from reading reviews on here I got way more than I expected happily.  The beds were comfy and linen fresh and clean daily. The bathroom in our room was a bit on the tiny side though with a great shower.   Now.. the lifts. No wait times at all apart from one day when one lift was broken and then it was only a couple of;4
Hotel is in a wonderful location for experiencing the city.  The staff was incredibly helpful and kind.  The rooftop bar is a great place to have a drink.  The neighboring restaurants are incredible and the hotel provides easy access to Central Park.;4
Just finished another of our regular stays at this hotel.  Excellent suite on 24th floor with fantastic views.  Handy for Universal studios (across the way) and access to freeways in all directions (if you do not mind LA freeway traffic!).  Staff are very friendly and helpful, from valet parking guys to bell guys, concierge, front desk staff, etc, many of them having been here for some years. Only downside is removal of minibars from rooms and the slow lifts (elevators), which are in need of refurbishment/replacement. Overall, a wonderful stay. Thoroughly recommend this hotel.;4
This hotel is really cute and has a great location, just above 54 Below (formerly Studio 54). You can usually get a  great weekend rate here as well. Bring earplugs bc if you face the street it is NOISY. But if you're traveling to NYC you should always have those in your travel bag! Good martinis and other cocktails in the bar - nice atmosphere.;4
Stayed with my wife and son for a week at the end of May. Very comfortable room with air conditioning. Staff very helpful and obliging and were always available. A special thanks to Mohammed in reception who gave us a room with a lovely view. The hotel is very central and and the door staff were always on hand to call a taxi when needed. I would definitely stay here again. The Tic Toc restaurant serves a great variety of food and is open 24 hours. The breakfast there is especially good;4
Very small room but convenient location and comforable.  Good value for the price.  Glad to have a muring in the room. Very helpful friendly staff. Updated decor. Comfortable bed. Safe in room. ...............;4
Stayed here for a week with my brother. Huge room with two double beds, own shower room, balcony, TV etc. Only slight disappointment was no Nintendo console as advertised.  Relatively quiet area and very close to the Metro and the bus stops. Area isn't too bad, no real trouble that I noticed but we weren't out after 8pm at night.  Good selection at breakfast with eggs and waffles made to order, also cereal, drinks and bagles, pastries etc. More than enough to get you going for the day and saved us the hassle of somewhere to eat.  Great value considering where it is - only 15 minutes away from Hollywood on the train - and would stay again if I was going to LA. Only reason the sleep quality is so low is because I struggle badly with jet lag!;4
We stayed here for three nights. Had a good stay, clean rooms, average sized, no issues with the mini bar (we didn't use it), friendly and helpful staff, Jeff was kind, the concierge at check out the same. Over priced parking as it is all over Manhattan, but free if you leave it for at least 24h. Same block with Studio 54. Just around the corner downtown on 8th you can have a good breakfast at Pick-a-Bagel and awesome coffee at Ground Central;4
The perfect upper west side location. The management and staff were top notch. A very comfortable stay. Kudos to Halima Alauzaki, Shauven (GM) Jbellaiche (Dir. Of Operations) Damilo and Bernard. I will Be Back definitely.;4
Having been updated recently to its original 1920s decor this hotel looks fantastic although the bedrooms are a little dated. The staff were really friendly and the Tick Tock diner attached was perfect for breakfast and brunch. The location next to Madison square garden was ideal for getting to see all the sights uptown and downtown and so close to Times Square. All in all a fantastic place to stay.;4
not as bad as we expected, hotel is basic but clean and comfortable.  rooms are ok in size. good location and lots of good places to eat nearby. subway is close by as is central park. would definatly go back;4
Location was very convenient to the subway. Hotel is located across Central Park. There are 2 stores nearby where i was able to get muffins, bagels etc for breakfast. The rooms are tiny, reminded me of hotels in Europe but for what I paid, I'm not complaining. I'd stay here again the next time I visit NY.  If you are familiar with the hotels in Europe then you will be satisfied but if not then maybe you need to look elsewhere.  I stayed in a 2 single bed room. It was small, the bathroom was small, the a/c was extremely loud but like I had mentioned earlier, the location was great and also the price.;4
Excellent hotel choice for Universal area. Great pool area, hotel restaurant was great for both food and service and the room was one of the nicest I've seen in a while....immaculately clean, furnishings in great condition, relatively comfortable king bed, and spacious bathroom. We stayed for 4 nights and found staff friendly and helpful... Will definitly go back....;4
I had a very good stay in this hotel in midtown,  very good location to go anywhere. . All the staff were excellent, always helpful for every need. The  room was very clean. A special regard for Shay  and Francesca, they were like friends. From Italy, .... CIAO;4
The standard room is tiny, but it's really just fine for one person. Cozy and clean. The communal bathrooms were also very clean and easy to use. The location is pretty good, especially if you'll be mainly on the west side of town.   The public areas are really interesting and the hallways look like you're on a ship.  I'd definitely stay there again.;4
This is a charming & well designed new riad, which is located, in my view, in more remote, authentic, local medina (as oppose to the main touristy medina where you get hasseled often).  It offers great VALUE compared to other riads of comparable service & accomodation standard in Marrakech. Due to the remote location, however, female travellers may not feel that safe walking back to the riad themselves, especially after dark (although we did meet a couple of friendly locals who helped us find the riad when we got lost and they didn't ask for money as you tend to experience around the main medina).  Marco from the riad walked us to Jamaal El Fna on our first day and helpfully pointed out areas we should avoid exploring due to security concerns (we ended up taking a taxi back to;4
the room is big with all the service that I would need, e.g. I could find all kinds of food and beverages at the lobby. besides, shuttle service to the airport is reliable. if you don't have to go to city center everyday, I think this is good enough.;4
Overall the hotel Empire was excellent, the dÃ©cor is magnificent, staff very friendly and helpful. The doormen were so pleasant day and night. The room was lovely, bed comfy and bar was very comfortable. Only downfall of the hotel is that there is no free wifi, you have to pay for a package which in this day and age I feel is very strange especially if your staying for a week.;4
This hotel is a great way for a traveller with a limited budget to live in near-center New York. The staff is great and even though you have to deal with shared toilets and baths in the halls, I never experienced waiting time - even though I think the hotel was fully booked due to easter.   I would recommend the hotel for everyone visiting New York on a budget...;4
We had a small cabin room and believe me it is small. The location is great. Shared bathroom always clean and tidy. If you want to shower and sleep and not pay expensive hotel prices this is your place. Loved the history of the titanic and to still see parts of the arch to terminal was amazing.  Just a few metres from the hotel. We was there september and it was warm.  After a long day, sitting in the room wasn't good. We grabbed some beers and sat along the Hudson watching day turn to night and seeing cruise ships and boats sail pass. We loved it.;4
The rooms weren't overly big or fancy when we stayed (I understand they have been remodelled since)but has a prime location near Madison Square, Penn station and other sights that are within walking distance if you don't mind walking to explore the city. A short cab ride from the Port Authority (bus,subway). Nice little reataurant/cafe attached. Times Square and 42nd street (busy commercial area near Times Square)not too far away. I was really impressed with the friendliness of the people of New York, not anything like they're made out to be. Loved the city,the people,the sights. Tip. Take a tour of the city (hop on ,hop off type)  We took City Lights 2 day tour but there are others and you can get these online or from street guys (they have traffic vests and ID, a lot on 42nd;4
"We were in NYC to attend an opera at the Met. Great location, right across the street; clean, comfortable room; friendly staff. The restaurant breakfast was great & well priced. Would recommend & will stay again should I visit NYC.";4
After my first day at the hotel, I met Maggie who was servicing my room and we got chatting about the area, good places to visit and beyond. Maggie is the friendliest person I have met since arriving in New York City and a credit to her employers.  Not only did Maggie help me with little secret places to visit that most tourists don't see, she also supplied me with a full supply of nice linen, towels and consumables to make my stay at The New Yorker go without any problems.   Maggie even helped me arrange a coffee making kit by calling her manager and putting in the request herself - a little thing that really does go above and beyond for the customer and put me at ease in this foreign land.   My experience has improved ten fold after meeting Maggie and I wish her all the very;4
A great hotel, prime location, comfortable and friendly. I have been a regular guest here, and often find great deals on rooms. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are always spacious. The only thing that could be improved is the gym.;4
A grand hotel from the 1930s with friendly helpful staff.   We stayed in a basic room with queen size bed which was clean and tidy, if a bit tired in decor.    Disappointed that having paid hotel as part of package, including taxes, we were then charged 10$ per day for access to wi fi and the gym, both of which are advertised as amenities on their website.   (This might now be standard practice for hotels in USA, but not something we have encountered before).   We used the hotel bistro and trattoria which were good.   We used the airport shuttle service from JFK which took about an hour and half in heavy traffic.   Later learned that we could have used the monorail to Jamaica, then train to Madison Square Garden which only takes about half an hour.;4
Just returned from our second visit and stay at the New Yorker which tells a story in its own right .. Great location in the heart of Mid town close to Empire State Building , Madison Square Gardens , times sq ( ten min walk ) . We were given a great room overlooking the ESB and Madison SG. We did E mail ahead to ask for this . Room was nice , quite spacious which was a surprise based on previous visits to NYC. Only disappointment was the bathroom which was a little tired and in need of upgrading . Minor thing in the grand scheme of things . All staff were very helpful and we had no issues what so ever. The Tick Tock diner is a convenient eating place that serves 24 hours a day but better value and quality can be found within a couple of blocks walk. Not withstanding we ate;4
Overall, we were pleased with our stay. Staff was very friendly and professional.   Room 507 sink did not drain properly (gross)!   It feels petty because they charge guests  for Wifi, over and beyond the room rate. Iâd much rather have the cost embedded in my room rate than have to go through the trouble with the online form.;4
Normally check in is not until 3 but my friend and I had arrived after a 10 hour bus ride around 8:00 in the morning. The lady at the help desk said she would do her best to get us in ASAP and by noonish it was all sorted. Excellent location, clean room so overall a great experience and you cannot beat the price!;4
If you plan on visiting nearby places in NYC such as Lincoln Center, Central Park, etc. this is the most convenient location!  Pleasant staff.  However, don't plan on spending much time in your room while there.  The rooms are very tiny with no space to move and the temperature control in the room is questionable. While the lobby is very nice and inviting, too crowded to enjoy.;4
Very modern looking hotel when you first walk in.  Staff greets you at the door and our front desk check in person was very nice to us.  Offered to show a map of the area even though we had been multiple times.  Elevators were clean as were the hallways.    The room wasn't very big (although that's to be expected in midtown NYC).  It was clean and had a view.  Location was perfect, 10 minute walk to Times Square, close to many of the major theaters around there.    A little disappointed that the bar closed at 11:30 on a Saturday night but the bartender was very nice to compensate. Had two for one drink specials, which was a welcome surprise for midtown hotel on a weekend.    It's a bit noisy quite early but again its midtown Manhattan, its to be expected.  The one downside was;4
Great location across from Penn Station and Madison Square, Gardens easy to get anywhere from here the rooms are small but nice. Staff was friendly. Hotel was clean. Parking is nearby with a discount.;4
A decent budget hotel that is perfect for student trips.  Rooms are a bit on the hot side but clean and safe.  I took 25 students from the UK in April 2014 and saw no evidence of the horror stories that are all over this website.;4
it up there - 106th and W. Central Parkway - but its 3 blocks from a subway stop that goes straight into midtown and in a good neighborhood. Its really basic, clean and basic. But if you are going to NYC and you aren't planning on doing anything but napping in your room, its perfect. Lots a europeans seemed to stay here.;4
Having read some of the not-so-choice reviews of this hotel, I was somewhat concerned about what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised.   Ok, so it isn't the Waldorf Astoria, but how much can one expect for such a reasonable price, in NYC terms at least.   I arrived earlier than planned at 2pm, but my room was ready and I was able to check in straight away. The room was a reasonable size by NYC standards, but small of course by other standards, but as a seasoned NYC traveller I was impressed by the larger-than-expected size of the room.   The good: clean, easy location (subway on the corner) so felt safe as a single woman, nice enough rooms, not too noisy even though I was facing out to the street.   The bad: Only one small radiator under the window didn't really;4
This was a pretty neat hotel and it had a club on the top floor that was really hopping on the weekend on Saturday night.  Subway was really close and the concierges were very helpful and many places right around the corner to eat and a short walk to central park!!;4
If you like old world elegance and charm then this is your hotel.  I call it a favorite when I stay in New York city.  Location is incredible and the workability factor is great.  Note of caution if you do not like older charming hotels, then you might rethink your plans.  Along with charm comes smaller rooms and also the building shows it self as being older.  Service and atmosphere always outweigh these factors for my stays.  Great place to stay for Broadway plays.;4
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 2 night with 4 adults on the 2nd floor and the front of the hotel. We found this to be an good location, good breakfast if a lot choices, lovely friendly staff. Room was very clean and spacious considering we had two queen size beds. There is a pool however we didn't get time for a swim and no spa. There was a laundry and gift shop. The only negative was that you had to pay for parking $20 + tax.;4
I stayed at the Jane for four days at the tail end of Thanksgiving week. Staff went out of their way to help and even the elevator (which I had heard so much about) had no problems to which I was grateful (and being on the 6th floor that elevator was a lifesaver).  My only real issue out of my entire stay was the sound of the heating system which when turned on sounded like a loud woosh coming through the room which woke me up early every morning. From what I was told this is the sound of steam at high pressure coming through the pipes and with the hotel having been built in 1906 this was understandable. Old hotel, has a lot of character, it makes sounds and if you are expecting silence when you come to NYC you choose the wrong place. The Jane sits on a lovely little cobblestone;4
We all know what NYC hotels can be like -- small cramped rooms.  Hotels sometimes have to deal with the limited space regardless of the management.  The rooms at Empire, however, make the most oft the space -- stylish/modern, comfortable and calming.  Rooms are compact, but affordable.  They get genuinely dark for a good night's rest, bed is comfortable (and I have a bad back), and it's *clean.*  Hotel has a rooftop bar, as well as a nice one in the lobby.  It is a stone's throw to Central Park, some great Italian food nearby (don't miss Francesco's fast food pizza joint up the road, too), and the staff were gracious and friendly.  I understand that they're under new management.  The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because I reserve that for the top of the line hotels, etc.;4
this hotel is wonderful because to put it plainly, its extremey affordable, clean, and provides a hot complimentary breakfast, free wifi and laundry services. The 24 hour staff at the front desk was very helpful, one of them even let me use the laundry room after hours, as i was in a bit of a jam. The location was great, myself, being a walker, walked to hollywood and highland within about 40 minutes, and the very nearby griffith observatory/hollywood sign, and trendy Los Feliz area were even closer. I got well acquainted with the metro system as well. if anyone is looking to get to sunset strip, hop on the 2 express, which is just a  hop, skip and a jump away at sunset blvd and north vermont.the subway system is located here as well and is very easy to understand. it took me;4
We stayed at Astor on the Park November 5-8th and our stay was great! Yes, this hotel is older and rooms are a little small but if you are just looking for a clean comfortable place to take a shower and get a good night's sleep without breaking the bank then this is the perfect spot! Rooms and bathrooms  were clean and had recently been renovated. Staff was great!  Location was perfect just 2 blocks from the subway and in the vicinity of lots of great restaurants not to mention Central Park just across the street!  Would definitely stay again!;4
I stayed for two nights in room 636.  My view as of the airport, and the giant color-changing columns. I did not have any issue with noise - either outside from planes or neighboring guests. The hotel had a small restaurant/market area - both provided friendly service and the food/coffee was decent.  Check-in/out was a breeze.  It offers a shuttle service to the airport, but we did not use it as we had a car.  The hotel is ideal for those visiting Loyola Marymount College (only 15 minute drive), but if you want to go downtown - it is further out, and with traffic you could easily spend close to an hour to get there.  As well, a drive from here to Venice or Santa Monica will be about 20 to 30 minutes. My happy moment was a 10 minute walk to the nearby In-and-Out Burger.;4
If you are going to universal city it is probably a great place to stay. It is a very good hotel with a good breakfast cafe with a nice buffet. The lounge is just a side area with some tables and a bar but they often have a very nice piano player.  My room was perfect and must have recently been revamped.   It cost about 20 bucks to grab a cab into LA and the parking here is 24.;4
The hotel is very convenient to Universal Studios and some of the other studios in the area.  There is a small, but very adequate gym, rooms are clean with good beds, and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  You do pay for the convenience and parking may not be expensive for L.A. standards, but an added $24 per day may eat into a budget.;4
The Hotel was very nice when we walked in. Greeted by two friendly employees. The room was small, very nice and suited our needs for the night. I really enjoyed the walk-in shower and it was helpful due to my boyfriend being on crutches. AC was slightly loud and didn't cool down the room as much as I would have liked but overall I had a quiet nights sleep. Breakfast was ok. We would definitely go back.;4
We stayed here for 4 nights at the start of April 2022.  All of the staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful.  The room was a bit small for 3 people sharing, there was very little space to unpack or even lay out our suitcases.  The diner on the ground floor is good and the fitness suite has reasonable facilities.  It was really easy to walk to all of the main attractions in New York and is also close to a subway station.   Advice for buying souvenirs like hoodies, buy on a weekday, itâs much cheaper.   Would stay again!;4
This really is an enjoyable property to stay at. The rooms are great, the pool area is superb and the gym is well appointed. Being so close to Universal City Walk its a great place to stay if you have a large group to entertain, believe me! Something for everyone just a short shuttle ride away. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful also.;4
Hilton universal is a good hotel in a great location. if you want to visit universal studios this is the hotel to be. comfortable rooms, good and helpful staff, bought tickets for Studios from the hotel in good prices;4
Near Central Park, Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle... sensational! The place is very beautifull and calm! The room is good , clean and the staff friendly!!! I recommend! Is our home  in NYC!!!! Jonas;4
"There's a huge clustering of hotels in NYC in Times Square. While that's inarguably an exciting place to be, it's also maddeningly mobbed, noisy all night, and overwhelmingly touristy.  The Empire is only about 10 minutes' walk north of Times Square, but its Upper West Side location is worlds away.  One (long crosstown) block to Central Park; across the street from Lincoln Center.  A few blocks from the Whole Foods on Columbus Circle, the Apple Store at 66th & Broadway.  The subway cluster at Columbus Circle (59th Street) isn't as extensive as the Times Square cluster, but it will get you most places you want to go.  Best of all, though, this is a neighborhood: there are plenty of visitors in the streets, of course, but most of the skyscrapers are full of residents, people who";4
I stayed here on a quick business trip to LA.  The staff were very attentive, the room was clean and very comfortable.  I had a corner room with a great view of the valley toward Burbank.  The breakfast buffet is enormous (and pricey) and everything was fresh and served appropriately.  We were able to take advantage of the hotel's livery to get to dinner and our business meeting the next day (the driver, Hamlet, was great!) If I'm in this area on business again, I'll stay here. I'm not sure what, if any, more affordable options there are for families in this area.  This should be a bit expensive for a family trip.;4
It would be an improvement if there were a coffee shop and newspaper stand on the premises.  Having to walk out of the hotel to get a cup of morning coffee and a newspaper is an inconvenience. Loud music and dark lighting in the reception is down putting.;4
This hotel is BUSY and despite the amount of people going in and out of it, the staff is calm, friendly and makes each guest feel special, like they are a VIP and like they are the only person there. We didn't have to wait for anything. We were very impressed with this great welcome by the baggage handlers, reception, security, concierge, etc... Everyone was so nice! the room was clean and comfortable. Yes, ear plugs help, even on the 24th floor because of all the sirens on the streets. The location is PERFECT because it is walking distance to the Empire state building, Time Square and the tourist bus routes. I highly recommend it!;4
Excellent location! Next to Penn Station, walking distance to Port Authority and 42nd Street. Across the street from 5 major subway lines to take you anywhere you need to go! Historic hotel - museum in lower lobby pretty cool. Hotel staff were very nice.  It is definitely a high volume hotel so lots of foot traffic. My only complaint, which I cannot place on the hotel is the smell of the carpeting. At least on my floor and my room. This is totally UNDERSTANDABLE due to volume of guests and the dirtiness of New York streets. The hotel was very responsive and offered to change my room, I declined as more of a hassle to switch. I would recommend, and stay here again. Note daily facilities fee of $29+ tax,resort fee.;4
I was a bit nervous about staying at this hotel due to the bad reviews on here, but I was pleasently surprised. I will agree that it's not the nicest neighbourhood for a hotel to be situated in, but in no way is it dangerous. Me and my friend walked every night to the Wendy's, which is only a five minute walk away, and the only thing we encountered was alot of homeless people asking for change.  We found the staff to be very helpful, even sometimes going out of there way to help. Just before our trip to Six Flags, a woman behind reception spent the best part of 30 minutes trying to find ways to save us money on the admission fee, and she did. She went onto Six Flags' website and found out about an offer Burger King were running which saved us around $30 on the entrance fee.  The;4
I have stayed here many times and love the lobby. I think that Superman may come in at any minute.  I was sorry they redid the lobby bar. I loved the old world charm at Coopers Tavern. The Ruby Red Martini is a great bet.  The rooms are typically New York and the bathrooms are small. It is always clean if not getting a little worn. They are refurbishing rooms all of the time so I expect that will improve.  The security is very good and I always enjoy my stay.;4
My partner and I stayed at Morningside Inn in September last year. We were very happy with the location as it was only a short walk to the subway and central park. We stayed in a double room with use of shared bathroom and kitchen. Facilities were basic (no pots, pans or cutlery in the kitchen) and we could only get internet connection downstairs in the lobby. We stayed for 4 nights and got a great nights kip every night as hotel is located off the main road in a quiet road. Perfect for travellers who like a bargain, a great location and peace and quiet. Food, shops and atm within 5 minutes walking distance.;4
Mohamed at the Customer Service was fantastic! He went out of the way to be accommodating to our needs and gave exceptional service! Made us feel valued. The other customer service personnel and the rest of the staff we interacted with were great too. A very pleasant experience!;4
Great hotel! Good food! Very nice and friendly staff!Would recommend this hotel esp to families who will spend time in Universal Studiosðð¤ð» It was very convenient to go to the park because the shuttle comes around very often.;4
Mohamed who works at the front desk is incredible!  He was so friendly and helpful!  We could not have asked for better service. He went above and beyond to accommodate my family!  We appreciate the great customer service he provided!;4
A great location to see the highlights of New York. My only criticism would be that overall it is starting to show a bit of age. That said it does however offer great benefits like a pool, which other do not.;4
"From the moment you step through the doors you are transported back to the Art Deco period. Great levels of attention have been paid to ensuring that the style is not lost - that said there are some elements of the style that would be better hidden, namely the bedroom carpet! Great little gallery of photos from the past on the lower floor which give insight to the hotel's history.  Security is great - good to see that they monitor who comes into the hotel. No room card, no use of the lift and you also need a key card to use the restrooms.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens crisp; however the towels could do with being bigger, just about a standard bath towel size and the shower in our room was a bit leaky? The room was very compact but I guess space is at a";4
Perfect location for our summer long weekend stay.  Each morning we set out in a different direction and The Empire worked out well for us.  Personnel were knowledgeable and helpful when we needed anything.   The rooftop bar was a little crowded when we arrived, but we returned later that evening for a final cocktail and moonlit view over Lincoln Center.;4
This was our second visit to this hotel and it did not disappoint! Last time we visited we emailed to ask if it would be possible to get a universal studios view and we were given a fab room on the 20th floor with the view at no extra charge! We were so impressed that 2 years later we returned. We were impressed that refurbishments had just happened two years ago so couldnât believe theyâve happened again already.  Itâs very well taken care of! This time we booked executive floor universal view and were pleasantly surprised when they granted my request for the same room as last time. The breakfast is great but as an honors member paying extra for the executive floor we would prefer not to have to pay $10 surcharge plus tax plus tip to get the full breakfast. The staff are very;4
I love dit, the room we had intinally was as wide as a double bed and as long. i am a pensioner and ha to get up on bunk, hilaroius and not pretty , we knew what we were getting and i recommend. make sure you see the ballroom and have adrink on the rooftop;4
"Stayed here for the Tribeca Film Festival, and can't complaint. great price, great location.  for the price you can rent a crappy hostel with shared bathroom, here for less than $100 a night we had our (spotless and big) bathroom, we even got an upgrade on our bed.  I don't understand people, NYC didnt get the name ""the city that never sleeps"" for nothing, if you rent any hotel in NYC to stay indoors is a waste of money, all you need is a place to lay your head after enjoying this great city.  My experience on this hotel was super, big bed, big bathroom, clean, great location, subway on the corner (less than 60 steps), great service, and the staff is really helpful and nice, free internet on the lobby, what else can you ask for?  totally recommend it.";4
"I stayed in a Junior Suite during a quick stop over in NYC. The hotel is in a great location, the lobby is clean, but looks a bit ""loved"", as it seems they see a lot of traffic. Despite the traffic in the lobby, check-in was swift and pleasant. The guest room was clean, comfortable and seemed to be updated. I would definitely stay here again. Recommended.";4
We visited over a 4-day period to get in a short vacation. We chose the hotel because it was a classic hotel with character and history. The hotel is a bit older but had all the things that we were looking for. We had a minor issue with the room keys and the staff resolved the problem by upgrading our room to one with a view.  It is within walking distance or a subway ride to about anywhere in the city. The staff was very friendly and helpful and provided anything we needed. The wifi was surprisingly fast and that satisfied the younger members of the family.  If I were booking a stay in NYC again, I would choose this same hotel.;4
i was there in last April 2016 to spend my vacation there after my business trip. it is a good hotel with good money value & decent.  i disappointed only from the reception staff at my first time , i have arrived early but the they didn't accommodate me early ,But the reception staff is good people for the rest of my accommodation .;4
Real unfriendly reception and extremely expensive breakfast, but room absolutely OK with good air condition and clean shared bathroom, enough place for my luggage and all my stuffs though the tiny room.;4
Hotel was clean enough.  The staff were mostly very pleasant to deal with. The pillows and beds leave much to be desired. The shuttle to the airport is very convenient. We did have a small issue and it was promptly corrected with a phone call.;4
We have stayed in The New Yorker a few times now. The first time we stayed in the metro room with 2 queen beds. Quite small and brown decor. Bathroom was tiny with a shower/bath that leaked everywhere.this was about 9 years ago so i think a lot of the rooms have been refurbed since then the other 2 occasions we stayed in suites- the extra room is a bonus but not necessary.....you're in NYC after all, who wants to spends all their time in the hotel room?! Suite would be good if you have a 3rd person who wants their own room (roll out sofa), or like us you were getting married and needed the room for all the preening that takes place :) Overall it is a good hotel is a great location. Sure it's a little worn but it is a good price. If you join the rewards scheme you can get points;4
This hotel is the only one I go to when I'm in LA. Access to Universal Studios is awesome with their shuttle that takes you to city walk. The staff is always friendly. The rooms are always clean the only down fall is the water pressure in the shower isnt very good. But I love this hotel!!!;4
We spent four nights in the New Yorker and enjoyed our stay in this very attractive hotel. Our room was quite small and I'm not sure the view was worth the extra that we paid, but the air conditioning was wonderful and it was clean and comfortable. The staff that we met were friendly and helpful.;4
Pretty much a short walk to most of the main attractions in Manhattan. If you score a deal on a room then you'll really luck out. The rooms are normally pricey, but that's what you expect to pay for a good hotel in a great location.;4
We stayed at this hotel during the 4th of July weekend.   The New Yorker, Wyndham Hotel is a historic hotel located at Eighth Avenue & 35th Street in New York City, United States. The 43-story Art Deco hotel opened 1930 and is located in Manhattan's Garment District and Hell's Kitchen areas, near Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, and the Empire State Building. The hotel offers two restaurants and conference space. Since re-opening as a hotel in 1994, it has undergone capital improvements, including lobby and room renovations and infrastructure modernization. The Unification Church purchased the building in 1975, and since 2014, it has been part of the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts chain.  We were here as part of conference with hundreds of other attendees.;4
Great location next to Ed Sullivan Theater and times square and Central Park. A Good value for down town Manhattan. Our room was very clean and with a swanky design. Super comfortable bed and linens. Amazing shower.  Staff treated us well.;4
The last time I stayed at a Hyatt in Ontario, I was thoroughly disappointed. I was nervous about staying at this one but check in was a breeze. They gave me a large room clean room and per my preferences for Hyatt. I just didn't care for the fact that valet was $55 for 1 night and to self park, it was $26 for every time I need to go in and out. I think parking should come with our stays.;4
- The location is fantastic. Right next the subway station for links all across Manhattan, madison square garden is pretty much next door and it is only a short walk from the Empire State Building, Macyâs and Times Square. -There are loads of great pubs and restaurants 1-2 blocks away but if you decide to eat at the hotel the trattoria bianca has decent food and a relaxing bar. Butcher and banker restaurant also on site,  was very quirky in a bank vault under the hotel, but very expensive in my opinion.  - as a lone traveller, I found the room size (a standard queen) to be absolutely fine for my needs. However it would feel quite small for 2 people so be wary of this when booking. the beds are not queen size they are doubles, the bathroom is very small and the tv can be;4
The Hollywood hotel is a great hotel to stay in for seeing LA. There is a secure car park (which is essential in LA, as the city is huge). Breakfast was served each day and was very good. There was a nice outside pool, gym and sauna that can be booked free of charge.  Overall, a great hotel with friendly and helpful staff.;4
I like the Empire.  I have stayed here several times.  The rooms can be warm, due to the radiator heaters, but I tend to like that and if you don't, you can always open a window.  The rooms are not large, but, it is NYC after all.  The only bummer is no bathtub (just a shower), but that's not a huge deal.  The staff is always friendly and it is clean.;4
We spent a night at the 1070-room Wyndham New Yorker this week, and got everything we expected, and more.  The hotel is an easy, 10- to 15-minute along Eighth Avenue to/from Times Square, but maybe more importantly, it is a block from Penn Station, from which it's an easy walk, even with a rolling suitcase.  This makes the Wyndahm New Yorker a very good choice for any visitor arriving on AMTRAK ... it's not the only full-service hotel in the neighborhood, of course, but in our opinion, it IS the best choice.  We liked the well-preserved Art-Deco ambiance in the lobby, but the smallish guest rooms, were newly decorated in a contemporary motif, and ours had a large walk-in shower in a small but adequate bathroom.  We thought that the public areas and guest rooms were accurately;4
"We highly recommend this Riad. We stayed 4 nights and were treated so well by the entire staff who are willing to help with any problem guests may have. As we arrived Valentina provided us with important information and asked about any dietary wishes or problems. The Kheirredine is simply a little gem. It was a relaxing place to come back to after a full day of being tourists. The roof-top terrace is something everyone should take time to enjoy; the light in the morning can be very good for taking photos and one evening when we returned to the Riad we had tea on the terrace, relaxed and took in the night view of Marrakech. Magical!";4
We found the hotel reasonably (for New York) priced.  Room was very small but clean.  Staff were helpful.  Only hiccup was the lack of a strong wi-fi signal.  Excellent location.  We would stay here again.;4
This was my first time visiting New York we were welcomed by lovely smiley staff rooms where abit smaller than pictures but are view was absolutely amazing! Tick tock restaurant attached to the hotel was lovely amazing staff! On the last day we was waiting for transfers the guy on the desk refused to phone as he has been in the situation before and he told me the transfer had to b re called 48 hours before, then the lovely John phoned them for piece of mind it didn't come but he made sure we got to the airport on time for our flight!! Would definitely return hotel was a fab location!!;4
The hotel is undergoing room renovation. The paint in my room was fresh and there was new flooring, but it still had ancient wallpaper and no bathroom upgrade.   The staff was top-notch and the breakfast was wonderful. I also appreciated the mini fridge in my room.  The area around the hotel seemed a little scary, especially at night for a solo female. But the location is very convenient to 3 nearby hospitals and also to a metro stop.  I thought the charge for parking was exorbitant, but I also appreciated having a secure parking lot with someone on duty 24 hours a day.;4
We stay here once a year, and have always enjoyed it. Great location, wonderful staff, iconic history. It's a gem, I think. She may show her age in spots, but that's part of the enduring charm of an historic hotel. We love the Tick Tock Diner, the proximity to subway, Broadway and Macy's. Walking distance to many cool spots.;4
First of all, the grounds are beautiful, wonderfully landscaped, and the courtyard is no exception - it was a pleasure to have the views from the room balcony and second floor terrace of the cypress trees and palms, lights, and fountain in the courtyard. The room was nice, bathroom spotless with a very nice walk-in shower and vanity, and bed was always well-made.  Staff were courteous and helpful with questions, and breakfast selection downstairs was great. Hugo was the breakfast chef and will make any kind of omelette with a generous selection of ingredients! The downstairs cafe is very nicely furnished as well, and of course everything has Hollywood-inspired design.  A few things that kept the excellent stay from being that much better--the air-conditioning in the room is on;4
Room on the 9th floor with views of the hills and the Theme park. Room was clean and the beds comfortable. Room was quiet. On our arrival at 9 am ish after 14 hr flight from Sydney was offered early check in for 25 dollars extra. Gladly accepted, and we all had a very good restful sleep. Hotel is short walk to Universal studios and Studio walk. Wifi is available for surcharge. Room tidied and towels replaced daily. Shower was very low flow, as is the norm in hotels these days, but was difficult to enjoy with such little water. Lifts being modernised, as was the lobby. Some construction noise evident as we were passing through but certainly not heard on the 9th floor. Overall, comfortable and courteous and friendly staff.;4
The hotel is located opposite Penn station and only a block away from Macys & the Empire State Building It is a lovely Art Deco Building which has been well renovated  There are two restaurants on the ground floor, Bianca an Italian restaurant and a great deli called Tick Tock This restaurant is open all hours ,has an extensive menu and the food and service are both very good  We had stayed at the hotel before and this time our room was very small. The Queen bed was almost against the wall and it was a squeeze to get around it at the bottom The bathroom was adequate with a good power shower  Service was excellent with all staff being friendly & helpful;4
Avoid the top floor as rooftop noise is significant. Rickey and Pasquale at the front desk were very helpful. Lobby area was dark and elevators were not fully functional. Workout facilities were small and hard to find, but were adequate.;4
very close to the metro link but its in a neighborhood that we didnt venture out into at night..... nice pool area. nice breakfast but after a week theres only so many ways to cook an egg.. 2 girls on reception were lovely and bubbly very easy to talk to. although the courtyard has been refurbished the rooms are in need of a refurb and hopefully you wont get a room near the noisy vending machines....;4
Absolutely beautiful decor. Large rooms and bathroom. Had a coffee shop, gift shop and can pick up basic needs. We were there for only a few hours so cannot comment on distance to city. They provide a free shuttle service to and from the airport.  Friendly staff and a pool. Nothing else to do around the hotel. Very happy with our quick stay. Served its purpose.;4
We Recently stayed 2 Nights at the Ameritania Hotel. The location was just Fabulous, 5 min walk from Times Square, 7 min walk from 5th Avenue. The Rooms were newish and was pleasantly surprised. The AC however was ancient and loud and at disturbing at night. The soundproofing could also have been better considering its in the heart of NYC. we were on the second floor and at times even a friendly conversation below could be heard in the still of the night. If you are a sound sleeper these small sounds wont bother. Apart from this the rest of the experience was an amazing one.;4
Was here for 6 nights due to E3 convention.  Hotel us conveniently located near Red line for easy to downtown LA. Room was clean and specified to be opposite street side. (much quieter). Only gripe on room was bathroom  (toilet seat) which was completely replaced immediately.   pool was great to unwind and breakfast was freshly prepared each morning. Sonia & Hugo provide EXCEPTIONAL service & are a pleasure to deal with. Many wifi access points. Airport Shuttle available. I would return again.;4
Stopped for 2 nights when in LA. Hotel everything you would expect from a Hilton - rooms clean, staff friendly and helpful. Location was excellent .. a 3minute walk to universal, free shuttle if really lazy. Car parking is a ripoff .. why do they charge guests .. I hate this. We had buffet on 1st night ($50 each) and a great selection of food. A short drive to hollywood boulevard and next to freeway so cant complain about location. The elevators seemed to take forever - it appeared only 2 out of 5 were ever working ! Prices at bar were reasonable. Would certainly stop here again.;4
We stayed 4 nights at the Empire and enjoyed our stay. We did lots of walking and found it easy to walk to and from Times Square and surrounds both day and night, but there are a few subway stations around the hotel that will also get you to places easily. Decor is lovely. We didn't spend much time in the pool area or bar but both seemed to have nice atmospheres.    The few things we found (stopping the hotel receiving 5 stars) are minor but worth advising: - I didnt have a key one day when returning from sightseeing (as left it with hubby) so I asked the front desk for a key, I was given one with no id check etc. I felt a little uncomfortable that it was this easy to get into a room.  - The rooms are small but understand this is NYC thing - just be prepared for little room -;4
The Hilton Universal is a very nice hotel with a great location if you are going to Universal Studios.  We stayed two nights and overall enjoyed our stay.  The only problems we had were with the beds (doubles instead of queens - I probably should have looked more closely at my choices when booking), and parking.  I did not valet and had to circle the garage for about a half hour to find a spot.  They had a large conference or wedding going on and the parking was taken by that.  Overall though, we enjoyed our stay here and would probably book again.;4
"The hotel is just 8 minutes walking from the subway station. The area is great for dinner, drinks or just hang out. Our room was tiny (bunk beds) but there was air conditioner, so it was quite comfortable. Bathrooms are absolutely clean. Staff are very kind. They kept our luggage (for free) the whole day until we went to the airport in the evening. Decoration is ""quaint"" but great at the same time.";4
Absolutely loved this hotel. Location is great, so handy for Times Square, train station etc. Also plenty of shops and cafes around it. Hotel was also very clean and staff friendly. Tick tick restaurant located in hotel was amazing for breakfast and desserts. We also had a view of the Empire State Building from our bedroom which was amazing. Definitely recommend and would definitely return.;4
If you're just looking for somewhere to sleep and store your stuff- the Jane is perfect. The rate is much lower than other places as the rooms are tiny and you share a bathroom but this suited us just fine. The location is good as it is close to bars and restaurants but the subway stop is a ten minute walk. Not for everyone.;4
Stayed for 2 nights prior to a transatlantic cruise that left out of Brooklyn. We chose this hotel as I had some Wyndham points (transferred points from Caesars/Harrahs casino) and it was a great location. We arrived early since we had a redeye flight into JFK. When trying to checkin we were advised nothing was available but they could store the luggage. Mohammad at the desk was extremely professional and caring. Since we had not slept we really were not in the mood to walk around the city yet so we just camped out in the lobby for awhile (with a little nourishment from McD's across the street).  After a couple hours a room became available. Security is very good at this hotel as you have to show key to get towards elevator in lobby. I liked the building as it has alot of;4
Ok if you look for an apartment to explore upper east side then Woogo is great....there are major musings is this project don't expect luxury staff but expect a filling like ordinary apartment time to relax east sleep have a good hot bath and then get out to explore;4
Great place.  The valet, bellhop, front desk, housekeeper, bartender, restaurant madre d, all made for a really great experience.  Our junior suite was really beautiful, most comfortable bedding, convenient tv that angled in all directions off of the wall, the snacks and drinks weren't overly expensive and the system didnt charge you for just picking up an item like some modern amenity trays and refrigerators.  The only down side in the room was that the shower was not that much pressure and the half-shower door lets water out.  Lobby could use some new fabric on the furniture, glass doors into the lobby are very heavy, rooftop bar smells, has sticky floors, way too crowded, waitress was very rude.;4
This hotel was one of the most well put together hotels I've stayed at. From the rooms, to the rooftop bar, to the lobby everything was classy and elegant. The price was great for a Hotel in Manhattan and the location is close to the park and the subway. Staff was friendly and quick, we had no trouble checking in or out. The room was decently sized and super clean. We had no problems at all with this hotel and are looking forward to staying there again when we return to New York.;4
This hotel had its positives and negatives, though mostly positives. Upon check in I was greeted with a smile by a desk clerk who was extremely friendly and personable. She joked around with us telling a story about how a guest got upset with her because she could not provide him an ocean view room (the hotel is nowhere near the ocean). This definitely started our stay with a smile on our face.   I am a Gold HHonors member and I did get a free upgrade to the executive level. While the room was certainly not a suite, it was very comfortable, seemed recently updated, and had an awesome view out the window. However, we would not stay in this room for long as the air conditioner did not work. The new room they changed us to was even nicer. They compensated with a free pay per view;4
I was impressed with the Hotel. The size of the rooms and the amenities that you offered.  One thing that bothered me was one night when I was sitting in the hallway of the 4th floor talking on the phone I did see a cockroach (or something that looked just like a cockroach) crawl out from underneath the door of one of the other rooms.  I think maybe you might need to spray for bugs.  Other than that though I throughly enjoyed my stay.  Thank you very much!;4
We really enjoyed our stay at the Empire Hotel. We received a lot of useful information at the reception desk and were very pleased with the friendly and warm welcome. The room was very nice and cozy and the window gave us a great view. The location, nearby Central Park and Times Square, was perfect. A very good operating base if you want to explore all the amazing parts of Manhattan.;4
Best place to stay when visiting universal studios, its just across the street. you can walk over to the park, avoid parking fees at the attraction (you will pay $27 daily parking fee for the hotel) if you get tired spending the day at the park you can get a hand stamp, walk back to your room, rest up and head back for more fun. (the room rates have risen 30% to 50% (and in some cases more) in the past couple years) hotel is in need of more renovations.;4
Stayed here for a week good sized room kept clean by the maids pool area was clean staff helpful but could do with more sunbeds staff in restaurant were very good with special mention to kester lopez the restaurant supervisor and alan the waiter who were both very good and very helpful as were all the hotel staff good location near universal studio and parks with free shuttle bus one minus point hotel could maybe do with a bit of a refurb with new carpets as present ones are looking a bit faded but overall we enjoyed our stay;4
Clean, quiet, except for the occasional sirens...I would definitely stay here again. Good security, staff was helpful and eager to please. We didn't dine on site this time but would in the future. Great bagles around the corner on W34th.;4
This is my third stay here. It is located close to FIT College Kaufman Hall dorms. The staff is amazing in the hotel and the two restaurants - the Tick Tock Diner and Trattoria Blanca. The rooms are very small.  Don't pay for a view room - haven't gotten a good view yet. Rooms are very clean. Some bathrooms are not updated and it is hard to regulate the water temp (be careful with kids showering - can get very hot). Housekeeping are great - they always say hello and ask how your day is going. It is located kitty corner to Penn Station and a great place - Lucy's. Can't say enough about the staff. So very nice. If you can handle a small room - this is a great hotel. If you go to Trattoria Blanca sit in Patagiota's section, she is awesome. She recognized my daughter and I from our;4
"We decided to splurge and stay at a ""nice"" hotel close to Universal for our vacation this year. We usually try for lower-priced, decent hotels. The hotel was very nice, had an excellent restaurant and lounge, a beautiful view, a great pool, and was very close to Universal (10 minute walk). The shuttle service was nice as well.   The only thing that was surprising was the size of the beds. We had a double room, and assumed there would be queen beds, but they were ""full"" or ""double"" beds. We had bigger beds at the much less expensive Best Western during the first leg of our vacation in Santa Monica. We had two adults and two kids, so a little challenging. Other than that, we had no complaints and would stay there again.";4
Hotel was nice, room was clean, front desk professional. It is very close to the airport, but very soundproof. I did not hear a single plane. Arrival by car was a pain, the portico / drop-off area was closed off with cones for valet parking. The other entrance was shuttle only with no stopping signs, so there is no place to pull up and check in like at most hotels. Recommend just parking straight in the parking deck on arrival, way cheaper than valet even if making several in/outs.;4
Great location for visiting Universal Studios and Hollywood. Lovely large rooms and very comfortable beds. Just a few minutes walk to the Citywalk restaurants and the theme park. Highly recommended for couples or a small family. Helpful staff;4
We all enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania. This was our first time visiting New York and the location of the hotel was perfect. A few minutes from Central Park, Times Square and lots of restaurants and shops. The room we had was large and clean, especially the bathroom. The only complaint we would have is the noise. The air conditioning was very loud and of course a lot of noise from outside.;4
Let's face it, if you're staying here it's because you're trying to maximize your travel dollar in expensive New York. I stayed here for six nights as a solo traveler and all the accommodations were adequate. Having stayed at a Pod hotel in the city before I felt that this room utilized its space much better. Useful hooks and shelves made putting stuff out of the way fairly easy. I did not hear the weekend club music in my room and didn't really run into anyone waiting in line for it outside. The only concern of noise was the air conditioner and the closing of doors (I use ear plugs so I slept well...I suggest you do the same here). The bathrooms were of no concern. People mostly just went about their business in a quick manner.   My issues with this place are centered around;4
Rooms were roomy and spacious for a NYC hotel, especially given the value. Also like the location. It is extremely convenient to get around. Hotel was great, but only thing is it could be a bit noisy at night with the street traffic. The hotel provides ear plugs, but I found it helpful to turn the fan on at night so the white noise can drown out the traffic.;4
Spent 3 nights at this property in October 2013. Chosen due to its proximity to Universal Studios. Very comfortable room and bed, quiet pool area and short walk to the park & City Walk. Big buffet breakfast available. Short walk to metro rail, which is cheap, clean and easy to use. Good place to stay, moderately priced.;4
After reading the reviews, I was scared of coming here. However,my room ( smoking - eleventh floor) although small, was clean and comfortable. I had a good kingsize bed, and the bathroom was clean and functional.The elevator was slow and clunky,but it got me to my floor.The subway was only across the street.The service at the front desk was affable enough.I got this hotel on Hotwire, and I would certaily give this hotel another try/;4
Great location. the walls were extremely thin. The bathroom had no locks. And it was dark inside the room. Despite lights. But nearer to Transit railroad and metro. Great service and ability to drop off luggage if you are early.;4
Easy check in and we were upgraded to another room.  Rooms are very small and only one chair to sit in with very little room.  When you entered one had to stand to the left for the other person to get it as the bed was in the way.  The bathroom was so tiny there was hardly enough room to dry yourself off.  On the upside the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. Unfortunately our room did not have much of a view, but we were in a safe area an close to shops and Penn station.  It was noisy but most rooms in New York int his area are noisy as there is so much going on.  The staff were very friendly, just a shame the rooms were so small, but I have been told this is with most rooms in NY.  They charged us extra on our credit card and they have not yet got back to me.;4
We stayed here for the New York leg of our American honeymoon in August. Room was small, but had everything we needed. The hotel was clean and inviting... ice cold water & hot drinks available all day and night. The staff were all friendly. Jeff was AMAZING... he went above and beyond to make our stay in NYC wonderful. We looked forward to seeing him each and and he seemed genuinely interested in what we had been up to (and was a valuable source in information about the city). The hotel is very close to Times Square and Central Park, so we were in the heart of the city, and loved it!!;4
Hotel was conveniently located near the airport rooms were clean hotel staff was helpful and friendly for parking at the hotel seemed at times to be aggravating And the parking was a little expensiveAlso using the elevator became a little bit annoying having to continuously swipe my room key to change floors or go down to the lobby but the breakfast was really good the hotel is close to shopping malls And casinos which I loved!! Overall this is a pretty good hotel thatâs located near the airport;4
We stayed at the Ameritania for 1 week at the end of September. We choose the hotel for the location, good reviews and price. When booking we upgraded to a deluxe room. For only a few extra pounds a night we felt it was worth it for a much larger room as we were staying for a week. The room was spacious, lovely large, high pressure shower. Comfortable king size bed, although a little soft for my liking. We used the wifi in the lobby several times before we headed out for the day or after returning. Had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which were reasonably priced (for NY). Ice cold water was available 24 hours a day and tea & coffee in the morning. The location of the hotel was great, just a few minutes walk from Times Square and Central Park and very close to a subway. There;4
What a fabulous find ( thanks to Trailfinders) - centrally located and value for money. The hotel is quirky with great decor and lovely rooms. The bathrooms are well stocked and have a great shower.   I could not fault the staff in any way, BA lost all our luggage and they could not do enough to help us, lending us adapters, offering free Wi- Fi and keeping us up to date with news.   The rooftop bar was my best highlight and only complaint. It has the most  incredible views and the perfect place to relax on after a day out in NY. The fact it closes at 9pm is such a waste of the hotels best feature! Having said that I think $20 for a small beer and 2 cans of coke was scandalous and possibly would put people off staying up there. I'd really suggest looking at this as the prime;4
If you are looking for a place to stay with a great location and aren't too worried about a smaller room then this is a good choice. Room had all the essentials including hair dryer and wifi but not much room for any activities other then sleeping! Room service very average. X;4
"How lucky to find well maintained digs right in the center of all the exciting activity in Lincoln Center. The staff, probably the most important factor next to good accommodations, is warm and friendly.  From the helpful doormen (Chris, Constantine, Eugene, Dennis, to the reception personnel like Charde and Pasquale), all aim to please.  Accommodations are comfortable and many of the rooms are being refurbished as I write this.  My only disappointment is with the old ""tried"" and true lobby furniture but I suspect that will be getting a needed facelift soon too.  The Empire is a hop, skip and a jump from the Metropolitan Opera, upscale restaurants, boutiques and shops.  The rates (for NY) are reasonable. I call it, ""my home away from home.""";4
"Our family had lovely rooms, very clean and spacious. Super comfy beds, plenty of room to relax. The cleaning staff was excellent. Front desk staff also superior. It's a very short walk to Universal Studios, the main focus of our visit, and we liked being able to come back to rest at the hotel before returning to the theme park at night for dinner and more fun.   So why the four stars instead of five? At 2 a.m., the smoke alarm battery decided it needed to be changed. A shrill electronic beep, about every 10 seconds, began. We were exhausted from our long day and sound asleep; the beeping scared the heck out of us. We stood on the table in order to reach the dang thing and yanked it down, tried to figure out how to kill the noise. Finally successful but so shaken, we never did";4
"Was somewhat concerned about my stay having read the recent reviews; but found the staff to be exceedingly helpful and the rooms very comfortable. It is an old hotel and I did have problems with my air conditioning, but was moved twice by the staff with nothing but smiles and offers of assistance with the move. I ended up in a much bigger room, but even the first room which was small and dark, was nonetheless clean and well appointed with a comfortable bed. It is a fantastic location and I would stay there again. Shame the pool was closed but my understanding was that this was due to a last minute, unplanned issue that had to be fixed. It really had no impact on our stay.";4
I had never tried a shared bathroom hotel before but after reading the reviews on here I decided this one would be alright to try.  I have only ever stayed up in midtown before but I think I will come back here from now on as I really liked Greenwich Village!  I would definitely come back to the Jane.  I only marked it down to 4 was that when I arrived at stupid-o-clock in the morning, about 4.30am, the bathroom was in a bit of a state, however all other times it was fine.  The room did have a bit of a musty type smell to it but wifi was good, free water in the room was good, air con was good and had ebough room for my stuff and subsequent shopping.  Didn't actually see many other people and never had to wait for a shower to be free.  Statue of Liberty visible from the shower;4
Staff were friendly and happy to assist.  Expected a bit more than paper cups, and plastic cutlery in the room, but that's a first world problem rather than anything else.  Facilities were clean and tidy.  Pool was well presented, tidy, and inviting.  Staff were highlight.  For the price, an OK place to stay.;4
Whenever we visit LA we always stay here. The hotel is continuously a winner. The location of the hotel is perfect for us, being close to Universal City Walk gives so many dinner options. You are close enough to LA but at the same time far enough away to not feel like your in the middle of the CBD. The hotel offers quality accommodation and an always friendly team of staff. I would continue to highly recommend staying here.;4
This hotel is located across the street from Lincoln Center.  The hotel caters to nightlife.  The rooms are a good size for NYC and priced fairly.  There's a lot of wallpaper-- but that's the hotel's style.  The pool is not as large as it appears on the website due to an optical illusion using a mirror.;4
Yes, parking is expensive here. But you have to pay to park everywhere in LA. You are allowed to come and go in the parking lot, so at least you only pay once per day. We booked directly through the hotel to get a better rate than from third party sites - sounds from the reviews here like rates can really vary. Our 2 queen bed room was normal US hotel sized, included small microwave and refrigerator, coffee pot and coffee. Bathroom was on the smaller side, and did need some work (chipped paint, some rust in the ceiling of the shower, etc.). We also had a balcony but the weather was too cold and wet to use it during our stay. Shower pressure itself was good. Heater was loud and we could hear the neighbors' heater when it was left running.  Inner hallways are wide and courtyards;4
This hotel has got all you need, close to main attractions, rooms are smart and big enough, nice place to eat on sight, plenty of lifts for high floors, and a nice art-deco appearance. Would recommend this hotel.;4
My friend and I went to NYC. The Wyndham New Yorker was a fine place to stay. It has some of the old character as it was built in 1929 (refurbished tastefully). It has a 24/7 restaurant (The Tick-Tock) connected for easy access with reasonable prices. Some of you may like big tall hotels and this one was good don't get me wrong. Just remember  that you wait by the elevators for your ride and you pick up others along the way down and up...so when you forget to bring your gloves you go all the way back through the wait to get them. The service was good. the front desk helped us get a much needed cork screw...no problem. Our room had a great view of the Empire State Building (#2145). It was a good place to stay. To save money you can go directly to the Hop on Hop Off Bus Tour folks;4
Stayed here in December a year back with my sister and love it. The rooms were warm and cleaned daily. Very spacious. Had a fantastic vie as we were so high up. Big double bed each.   5 min walk to Times Square. Great pizza take away right across the road is a must visit.   Asked for a kettle to be provided in the room but ended up getting a coffee machine. This wasn't a problem and was a Godsend after coming in from a cold night.   We didn't really have any dealings with any staff except on checking in and out, but they were very pleasant.   I wouldn't stay again only because I'd like to try somewhere different on my next visit. Couldn't fault the hotel at all. Very clean and adored the Art Deco.;4
We checked in on Christmas Eve, and we knew itâs going to be busy, but being a diamond member we expect a better service. We waited in line almost 20 mins before a family who wanted to check for the hotel price. We already checked in online but wanted to get our room card/key. After patiently waited for about 20mins, expecting to get our room key but the front desk staff asked us to wait for âa momentâ without telling us the reason. And that took us another 10 mins wait! Came back and we were told the room we checked in earlier wasnât ready and as the carpet was wet. But why canât she informed us earlier? Mind you we flew 4 hours from Houston Texas to SF and drove about 5 hours to LA! We expect to just check into our room without having to wait further. Other than that, it was a;4
Stayed here for three nights, excellent location right by penn street subway and near times square.  Check in fine apart from allocating us a room which people were occupying but that was soon sorted by giving us a new room on 25th floor.  The room itself was bigger than expected with two showers (double, double) and suited us fine, it does need renovating but to be honest we weren't in the room for long so for us it didn't matter.  The hotel bar is very reasonable price wise and we didn't use the diner as the hotel is so central.  No charges for us to pay since we booked with virgin holidays but we did have to pay 5 dollars per suitcase to store them on our last day which was to us seemed like a money maker.;4
We had a wonderful time at the Row NYC.  Our check-in process was simple. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the place was suitable.   We would love to stay there again. The price is quite reasonable for a nice location.;4
Just off the tourist trail but close to subway and only 2 blocks from Central Park.  Caters equally well for business and leisure travellers and has a relaxed but professional ambiance.  Wide range of quality shops and restaurants nearby.  Ed's Chowder House, attached to the hotel, is superb.  Hotel bar prices too high, even by NYC standards, but otherwise highly recommended.  (3rd time visitors to NYC.);4
Stayed during a busy summer heatwave.  Room was cool and clean.  Beds and pillows very comfortable.  Shame that a 3 bed configuration not available for 3 friends travelling together.  Trundle bed was quoted at $29 per night which seemed excessive and don't think it could fit in the room anyway.  Other downsides were no refrigerator or tea making facilities which for a 10 night stay would have been a convenient and helpful addition.  Great location right in the thick of it and wonderful city views from the 32nd floor.  Love the hotels history and elegance and overall we enjoyed our stay.;4
"I was attending world travel market and although I need to be close to the market place but unfortunately all acceptable hotels where fully booked so I decided to accommodate in Abercrombie house , I booked dbl room with my colleague mate , it's lovely place ,3 min walking from main hammersmith station , staff very helpful , rooms very clean and 5 min walking from primark mall , I went the primark in Oxford street "" main one"" but I thanked God that I have mine 5 min walking from abercone , also it's 25 min from Heathrow airport . On the end of street Starbucks cafe you can have your breakfast easily and all what you need surrounded in the area and away from noise and it's not that far away from main tourism district  I'm delighted to book at it with very nice price compare to";4
Nice Boutique hotel, clean room, good service. The perfect hotel and place to start sightseeing in Manhattan for a week. ItÂ´s very good located close to Broadway, Times square, Central ark and subway.;4
We stayed at Empire hotel NYC for my 30th Birthday.  We had booked a double room, however upon arrival JERRY the hotel receptionist who was booking us in, informed us that we had been upgraded to a Kingsize room as a gesture from the hotel. This was very pleasing. They also gave us free wifi access for our room during our stay at the hotel. Jerry was very friendly, welcoming and professional.   The room itself wasnt huge but we didnt go to New York to spend alot of time in our room. It was ideal for what we wanted it for. The room was well presented and clean. Our room was cleaned and reset daily to a good standard. It had a powerful and hot shower which is a must for myself.  The hotel door staff are very friendly. Always happy to help. And start your day with a smile which is;4
After hours looking for a reasonably priced hotel, came across the Astor. After booking it, noticed many of the negative reviews and got worried! It was a girly trip - me and my mum so basically a lot of shopping was on the agenda! I think the location was great - a few mins from 2 subway stations and a 10 second walk to central park! If I stayed right in downtown, I dont think I would have done so much. We ended up staying out all day and into the late evenings - why go all the way to New York to spend it in a hotel?  The hotel was basic, but perfect for what we needed - a huge bathroom, two twin beds which were really comfy, and tea and coffee downstairs with internet.  Dont get worried about negative comments. You have come to enjoy the most amazing city in the world, not to;4
This location is at 72nd and Broadway. Right around the corner is the subway stop so it is extremely convenient (and one of the reasons why we picked this place). The room was larger than we had thought based on previous reviews - adequate space for a double bed, small couch (not the most comfortable fold-out bed, but it worked), and a small kitchen with a counter. The closet was roomy and nearly a walk-in, and the bathroom was small but clean. There was a normal sized shower, small sink (no counter space unfortunately) and a toilet - the basics, essentially. The room had a large TV and a small dining table with two chairs as well as an ottoman. The view we had on the 6th floor was of the building across the street. We were woken up most of the days by 7:30 because of a garbage;4
First visit to NYC, stayed at the Empire Hotel.  Staff is pleasant, Yuri (concierge) is a pleasure to deal with, very knowledgeable about everything we asked him about.  My only complaint was that it was a booked weekend and they only had 2 elevators working.  When you are on the 10th floor, climbing those steps every time you come and go wasn't a pleasant thought.  There was always a 5-10 minute wait for the elevator.  Hopefully it was a one time issue.  Rooms are small but nice, bathroom extremely small only one person can get in there.  Overall nice place and I would definitely stay there again.;4
My wife and I just stayed at the Empire when visiting NYC to celebrate her 50th Birthday.  We received great service from the staff, especially Gunita who surpised my wife with a special birthday gift delivered to our (upgraded) room.  The hotel is a short distance away from the subway which gave us convenient access to the entire city.  The surrounding neighborhood is filled with neat shops and restaurants.  We'll come back again.;4
As expected our room was very small with bunk beds. My spouse has stayed there several times now with great success. Very reasonable rate. Be prepared for small room and shared bathroom. Bathroom was very clean. I only had to wait on shower one day for short time. We stayed three nights. Staff is wonderful. Need ice bucket no problem. Need fresh set of towels no problem. The window unit air conditioner was noisy but did work well. They have bicycles for use by guests 7 am -6 pm. Nice location to ride bikes along Hudson bike path. The High Line is very close also for wonderful stroll northward. Many cafÃ©s and Market nearby in Meat packing district. If you don't want to share a bathroom I suggest staying elsewhere. I would stay again.;4
The New Yorker is fabulously located for exploring New York City. The Art Deco feel is fabulous however the hotel is tired in places. Itâs quite clear the hire does bulk rather than quality but having said that we barely spent a moment in the room. The hotel is attached to a diner which is a little over priced but serves its purpose well. Overall would return and recommend this hotel.;4
I stayed at Hyatt LAX during a time or construction around it + it is near the LAX so you hear flights from the room if you're high up!  The rooms were nice because they provided ammenties needed for my stay:  refrigerator, security safe, keruig, fresh towels, good ingredient shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion!   Bring your own pillows and extra blanket to stay warm, but yes the heaters work and AC.;4
Good value and clean hotel, we were disappointed as we thought breakfast was included as stated on their website, however we were told at reception this was incorrect.   Links to metro and roads to main attractions are handy for a quick visit to LA. However there are not many restaurants in walking distance;4
Yes, it's a bit dated. But it's still very nice. The rain shower is wonderful. They upgraded us, which was greatly appreciated. Everyone is super nice and helpful. Very convenient to subway and Columbus Circle.;4
"After spending hours and hours on line, reading reviews of the ""reasonably priced""  hotel options in NYC, I finally chose Astor on The Park.  We weren't looking for anything fancy - we simply wanted clean and comfortable at a decent price for New York.  That's exactly what  we got.  Our room (#904) looked out over the park, down to the Manahattan skyline.  It was spotless clean, with cozy bedding, thick nice quality towels, great hot shower, and a new attractive carpet.  The room was REALLY small, the bed was a double,  so if you need space, this isn't the place to stay.  It is located way at the top of Central Park, but there are 2 subway stations within blocks, and it's a quick jaunt to downtown.  The service was genuine, helpful and very friendly.  They have a couple of";4
My family (of four) stopped 5 nights in Aug. 2011, we were given what doubles up as a disabled suite on the ground floor, so the size of our room was very considerable indeed. Hotel (ex-Ramada) was of a very good standard, it had a pool, a gym, a very good basement breakfast restaurant with excellent choices. Rooms were clean, towels changed daily. Location was superb for Hollywood and Universal/Griffiths Park (take the metro for these, 100m away) and trips could be booked from hotel reception if desired. The staff were always friendly. The 'down side' was $18 per day parking for our car, the area seemed a little run-down, and, though quite safe, a little dodgy after dark, with its fair share of vagrants. The metro and all the other attractions are pretty-well north of Wilshere;4
I feel that people that give a poor review for this hotel were somehow expecting a five star hotel.  For the price paid, it was good value.  All of the hotel staff I encountered were friendly and welcoming.  Breakfast was great for this price point.  One downside was the hotel is not within walking distance of attractions but because the metro was so close, getting around was easy.  We faced the courtyard on the third floor and it was very quiet.  The thing that prevented me from goving it 5 stars was the cleanliness and condition of the bathroom.  It seemed like the bed area of the room was updated but the bathroom was left for another day.  Overall great value though and I would stay here again.;4
We enjoyed staying at the New Yorker. They are in the middle of renovating   We were lucky to get a new room. It was quite small especially the bed ( it was supposed to be a queen but I think it was more like a full ). They need shelves in the shower and bathroom for shaving kits.   It us close to Madison Square Gardens and Oenn Station which has trains and the subway.;4
Overall it was a good hotel stay, every staff was exceptionally friendly and helped me a lot. The overall environment of the hotel is good, but there are some small stains on the quilt and bed sheets.;4
"This is a awesome classic hotel (meaning some small rooms), I arrived during a snowstorm, 12 hours late, at 6am after driving in from DC and was quickly checked into my room. I was lucky enough to stay in the ""Nikola Tesla room,"" the room that the famed physicist lived in for many years until his death (No ghost, I left an equation written on the pad for him to finish and he never did, but the lights did flicker once). The location of the hotel is great, walking to everything.   The diner attached to the lobby is open 24 hours, has amazing oreo cake and some pretty fantastic food around the clock if you don't feel like dealing with the hustle and bustle of the city just to get a quick breakfast or late dinner.";4
They were in the middle of some renovations when I stayed but the facilities were still quite nice. The staff were friendly and helpful. I was working at CHLA and the hotel was just a few blocks away making traffic completely irrelevant. The breakfast was great. I would absolutely stay here again.;4
"If you're looking for an afforable hotel in the Times Square area, it's difficult to find a better hotel than the Ameritania. It;s a 4 star hotel at a 3 star price. The service is superb starting with doorman/bellhop who greets you at the front. My only complaint is that there are three steps and no handicap rank to get your luggage up to the lobby. The lobby is modern and spacious with free coffee in the AM. The rooms are large by Manhattan standards. The bed was very comfortable, The showers were the modern rain forest type with a switchable wash bar. I recommend this hotel highly.";4
Good facilities, modern and beautiful rooms, and good service of all staff. And an extraordinary location between Times Square and Central Park. One suggestion: The beds a too soft. In my opinion it would be harder improvement mattresses;4
The room was clean and compact!!  The Empire is perfect if you are attending a performance at Lincoln Center, especially during the winter months, when weather can be bad.  The staff were friendly.  For this visit the cost was low compared to usual rates.;4
The front desk employees were exceptional at check in.  I overheard others on the airport shuttle commenting about the great staff at the Hyatt.  Danielle went above and beyond.  Hotel shuttle was also great......quick and convenient.;4
Nice Hotel, rooms are very outdated need some painting and fixing here and thereâ¦ Perfect location, beautiful lobby, staff is friendly, super nice and helpful! Food is good too , our family room didnât have coffee maker which is very inconvenient.;4
Recently spent two nights at this Hilton property and had a great stay. Had a room on the 22nd floor (executive) with a fab view. Included a continental breakfast which was very adequate. Service throughout the property was terrific. There is a shuttle to Universal which was very convenient although it is an easy walk. The room was very nice and very clean. The only complaint was with the business center. The computers were so slow they were almost useless. Please replace them!  Overall a great place and would stay there again.;4
I was kinda nervous because of some of the bad reviews but my friend and I were on a tight budget, so we booked a double for the weekend of Nov. 30th. We found the Morningside to be very nice. The staff was all very helpful and courteous. I don't know what everybody is talking about, but Patrick is a very nice man, I spoke to him on the phone twice to confirm and he checked us in and gave us directions to a bunch of places. Nice guy.  The room was average size, no luxuries but very clean and cozy.  We had a shared bathroom but it was right next to the room and was also very clean. The only thing we would have liked was a tv in the room. There wasn't one but hey, it's NY! we were so tired from all our walking and sightseeing that when we got back  we went right to bed anyway. The;4
"I rated The Jane as ""very good"" because for what they provide, they do a good job of delivering.  Located off West Street, hard on the Hudson River, the building is 100 years old and apparently was originally a place for merchant sailors to get a room between voyages.  The rooms are basically tiny cabins probably 6' wide and 10' deep.  built-in bed is cot-width but was comfortable.  A/C and wall mounted fan keep the room comfortable. Small window for the claustrophobics.  Flat screen TV. Lots of closet space (just kidding).  Bathroom is down the hall with fully enclosed johns and showers.  If you need an inexpensive place to sleep, or are looking for a quirky adventure in NY, this may be the place.  Their website accurately represents what they deliver.";4
Stayed at The New Yorker with the family for one week. Hotel was well located, rooms were clean and any issues were promptly sorted by reception. Agree the bathrooms are a dated and rooms on the small side, but overall very happy.;4
Stayed for 4 nights and was very impressed. Arrived mid-morning from Australia and had no problems checking in early, which was really appreciated. Staff were efficient and very obliging. Room was of a good size and the facilities were fine and the room spotless. Location is convenient to the red line metro (Vermont/Santa Monica stn) and so access is excellent for Universal Studios etc. There are some great restaurants nearby ( I can recommend Palermo and Kitchen). Self service breakfast was fine. It can get a bit hectic at peak time!I can't praise the front desk staff enough. They were so helpful and pleasant, and they ensured the stay was as enjoyable as possible. The swimming pool is behind the hotel and sits within a pleasant courtyard. Would definitely recommend a stay at;4
My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights and  really enjoyed our stay. Checking in was a breeze and  reception staff were very friendly. The girl  ( Anna) on front desk was worth her weight in gold - so helpful, knowledgable  and  friendly - nothing was too much trouble, she really made us feel at home.  Location is perfect with Metro station a few minutes away. Breakfast was included and was a great start to every day. Would definitely come back here again.;4
A great hotel for a trip to New York - modern, clean & a great location for getting about.  Rooftop club (weekends) & pool deck made it perfect for a summer girls NYC trip.  Only downside was that the hotel charged $1200 to my credit card as a security deposit on check in & didn't advise me - subsequently mu card got blocked by the bank.  An apology from the hotel but no more - I would have expected at least a bottle of wine from the bar as a token gesture.  Would stay again in the summer but will definately by asking at check in for clarification on security deposits!;4
The Empire has a look and feel of New York City and provided a comfortable base from which to explore the city. Our room was a little small but beautifully furnished and with a comfortable bed and great shower what more do you need.  We enjoyed two delicious breakfasts in Ed Chowder House and the view from the rooftop bar is glorious.  Drinks and food at the hotel is premium priced but to be expected.  The location of the hotel is very pleasing, close to lots of restaurants and bustling New York! We enjoyed some opera being broadcast live from Lincoln Centre in the evening which was an interesting diversion whilst eating al fresco in one of the outside restaurants.;4
I loved my stay at The Jane...so much so that I'll be going back for a few extra days this week. It has a charm and a style that is all it's own. Fantastic area - close to the subway with easy access to everything NYC has to offer, resturants, bars and stores. Staff were helpful and unintrusive. Everything is clean and well cared for. Yes the rooms are teeny tiny - but you know that when your booking so no complaints from me. Great place for a decent price - though don't forget about the tax on top of the charge....it can surprise you at check out!  I think the cafe is a little pricy - but it's a great space (with Vegemite Toast on the menu for those seeking the best hangover cure on earth!) and the service is hit and miss. The bar is also a great space but a little on the;4
I stayed for three nights in a small, standard room. The staff was friendly and professional. The standard room was small, but you know that coming in. I didn't mind. Using the communal bathroom was interesting in terms of seeing how different people use the shared space in different ways. The hotel does a good job of keeping it clean, in spite of the fairly high traffic. Overall, having your own bathroom is (of course) more comfortable, but I didn't mind it, esp. given the great price/location.   Cafe Gitane is convenient and has very good food. Ate there twice during my 3 days there.  I'm giving this 4 stars for two reasons: First, way too much Pledge was used in the hallway I was staying in, and for some reason the hallway windows were kept only an inch open. The smell didn't;4
I had a nice stay for an extended weekend.  The location is of course superb, with walking distance to many interesting spots on west side and central park etc. The ambient atmosphere in the lobby is very nice, with some sort of african safari evening theme ( I thought that was cool, as a metaphor for the urban jungle outside the door). The lobby is inviting for sitting down a couple of minutes for tactical conversation with a friend before going out on your next safari. By chance, I was lucky to have a room with two beds all for myself, so I had enough storage for my things for my three-night stay. But if you are staying utilizing max allowed capacity = four people in such room, be ready for some trouble organizing your luggage!   The bed was very comfortable, but sleep quality;4
This hostel lets you save money, that's the first thing to remember. And at this low price you get super clean rooms, super extra clean shared bathrooms at any time of the day, different kitchen for every floor at your disposal, a fridge in your room along with plates, mugs, cups, knifes, forks, spoons, toilet paper, shampoo and soap. Sure, walls are a little thin but seriously guys, at this pricr this place is amazing.  And no moquettes on the floor, which makes everything cleaner.  It's located a bit far from the center of city but it's litterally 4 minutes from the tube station, there's every kind of shop around and the neighborood is really nice. Top destination.;4
We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights on a work conference but took an extra few days to enjoy the scenery. We had a lovely stay at the Hilton Universal City and would definitely go back again. The rooms are a good size and give a nice view over Los Angeles. They were very clean with very soft beds and large screen TV's. The location is brilliant and only a five minute walk to Universal Studios and City Walk. There really is no need to get the shuttle bus. You are also only a 10 minute drive from both Hollywood and Warner Brothers Studios. Both will cost around $15 by taxi. The hotel has a very good restaurant but costly, we ate our breakfasts there which was about $23.00 per person for the buffet but worth the money for the selection and quality We walked over to Universal City;4
"When i booked this hotell for my NY trip i actually had to send an email just to ensure that the price was right, and it was!   When u pay 218$ for 3 nights total for 2 adults for a manhattan hotel it must be a bargain. The location was just perfect with the park across the street, and not that many tourists around. Local breakfast at some of the nearby cafÃ¨s is recommended. The metro is just around the corner to take you quickly downtown.  Our room was situated on the 7th floor and had a ""park view"". The elevator was a trip of its own but safely took us up and down, but we had to walk a couple of times downstairs because of staff used it when cleaning the rooms and it took ages.  The room itself was nothing to cheer about. Small, clean and out of date is three good words to";4
Not much to complain about -- an elderly elegant hotel that might benefit from the location close to the Met, that's why we chose it. Otherwise you would get more for the money elsewhere. A surcharge of 10$ for internet in the room is absolutely outdated in my opinion. Easy access with Metro 1 Lincoln Centre or A and C Columbus Circle.   The room was clean, the roomservice friendly. I asked for a room as high as possible and got one on the 2nd floor to the inside which was quite noisy due to the air condition. Try to avoid that.  A Starbucks in the same house for what we thought a quick breakfast but the food took forever and was allegedly given to someone else why we were wating for our call. I never liked Starbucks, now my wife is cured as well.;4
Well, booked a 3 night stay here through their website which was cheaper than 3rd party sites. I selected a deluxe room with 1 king bed. The corner room was very spacious and clean. The bed was very comfy. The bathroom is a little bit tight with a small toilet but it is very clean and modern. The doorman that welcomed us was very friendly but the front desk was just okay. There is an extra fee for in-room WiFi. There is free WiFi in the lobby if you do not have cellphone data. The location is great (5-10 minute walk from Times Square). There are also a lot of highly rated food establishments around the hotel. Overall, a very good stay.;4
"What more could you want with a NYC hotel? This hotel is clean,comfortable and charming!  The location is great-right opposite the Lincoln centre and subway with a starbucks on the corner (well there is a starbucks on every corner).  Room was cleaned every day and didn't have a problem with the noise at all.  The bathroom was adequate and spotless and big enough for the both of us.  Staff were all pleasant but the CONCIERGE were outstanding and are a credit to this hotel.  Yuri and Chris you were awesome and made our stay not only more enjoyable but helped us make the most of our time in New York with valuable information and a knowledge only true new yorkers have!!! These guys know their stuff people and i suggest one you've used them you leave them a ""thank you"" tip, as like";4
This hotel was amazing for $34/night (through lastminutetravel.com). Wow! It was simple accommodations and far from perfect, but Iâve had much worse accommodations for much more money. I was very happy with this choice.  We stayed for a week on the sixth floor and faced the park. It was pretty quiet, and we had plenty of light and a nice view.  The biggest problem was the lack of temperature control. We were there in February and the room was sweltering. Though it was below freezing outside, we had to run the air conditioner to avoid burning it up. Luckily there was air conditioning though! It was a little loud and made sleeping a little difficult, but sadly this is a problem Iâve also encountered at hotels much more expensive.   The bed was a huge king and reasonably;4
we arrived at this hotel and purchase a Disney ticket which is cheaper than at the Disneyland. and service was excellent, the staff really helpful to inform us about the Disneyland park. the less thing is when we check in to the room, we give the accessible room which is not suitable for us.;4
We booked through Virgin Holidays for our honeymoon and then i came on tripadvisor to check out what people had said about the Empire Hotel - crikey, if i'd read it before i wouldn't have gone near the place! However, our experience proved that some people just aren't happy unless they have something to complain about! Duration: 8 nights (first night in 108, front desk moved us to a better floor because we were on honeymoon, the rest in 1008).  Overall, a relaxing stay. We were in a small room but still had enough space to store 2 suitcases and move about. No issues regarding the design of the shower cubicle ( just put the bath mat down!) plus nice L'occitane tolietries. I liked the smart design of the room. The Empire could probably do with an overhaul of their air con (it;4
Great deal at a good, clean hotel. Mattresses were comfortable and we had a fantastic view of downtown and the park. Staff was very friendly. Only negatives: tiny sink that was impossible to wash your face in, elevator broke on the day we left and we were on the 10th floor. Also they ordered one of their cars to take us to the airport instead of a taxi and we paid twice as much. But overall, what a find. I hope they stay affordable.;4
I had mixed feelings about our booking after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We had a Metro Room with a city view on the 32nd floor. The room was smaller than we are accustomed to, but there were 4 of us and we had quite a bit of luggage!  As others  have said, it is an older hotel and she is showing her age, but I could see where Wyndham is slowly trying to make improvements. Had issues with the shower running hot and cold intermittently,but no issues with water pressure. The Tick Tock Diner that is attached to the hotel has really good food. Had two meals there and ordered room service, all very good. Location, though, is excellent!! Madison Square Garden on the next corner, Penn Station/post office across the street from that, one subway entrance;4
Upon check-in, I was informed there was no room for me.  Candidly, I did not properly check my confirmation or I would have noticed it was a day off.  In any event, the honors check-in staffer was less than helpful.  Normally, as a long-time gold member, you would expect action.  Please find a room for me here or at the very least call the Sheraton next door and help me find a room there.  This did not happen.  Nothing happened.  After finally securing a room it became very clear that my issue was isolated to this individual.  The room was great and the remaining staff were fantastic in every way.  I have stayed here several times over the years and the rooms are great.  Big room, big bathroom and a well appointed and clean environment.  The lobby is nice and for me the location;4
After booking last minute then reading reviews we were nervous - however... Friendly helpful staff - particularly helpful when we were struggling to get covid tests results back to fly home. Everywhere was clean. We never waited more than a couple of minutes for the lifts. OK so the rooms are a bit basic and tired but it's the oldest hotel in new york- there's history here!! And seriously do you come to New York to stay in your room!!?? The location is perfect for a tourist visit.  We would definitely stay again and recommend;4
The hotel may have small rooms, bot the location and service was great. Mohammed at the front desk helped resolve a booking  issue. The location was perfect for Times Square and Broadway. Very convenient to be able to check bags after checkout and come back for them after another day in town.;4
We stay at The Empire Hotel because of its location, since our reason for visiting New York City each year is the Metropolitan Opera. There are some drawbacks to the hotel's outdated physical plant: tiny bathrooms, inadequate lighting, poor space for hanging clothes, heating/cooling system that has a few surprises, dark hallways. But the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Eugene the bellman was very cheerful and helpful, as was the concierge. Our favorite breakfast waitress is a young hard-working woman who is studying nursing and has several children. She has worked in the restaurant for a number of years, and we look forward to seeing her each time. I'm embarrassed to admit we don't recall her name.;4
A beautiful hotel with lovely Art Deco features. Though not in the very heart of New York, Times Square is an easy walk away and some rooms have great views of the Empire States Building. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful - we even got a coffee/tea making machine delivered to our room within minutes of our arrival.;4
The hotel's architecture and profile are iconic.  The rooms are small, but if you're out on the town all day, who cares?  If you ask for a high floor you can get great views.  The lobby bar/restaurant is fun and offers good service.  There's also a large 24-hour gym in the basement. Very convenient to the subway, restaurants, Javits Center, and shopping.   I like this place.;4
We stayed for 7 nights over Christmas and had a very pleasant stay. Reception were most helpful. We had no tea making facilities but a call to reception rectified that. Housekeeping was good and done on a daily basis. Lovely hotel with lots of history. A real 1920's feel about it. Ideally located. We had a fabulous view from our hotel room of the Empire State Building (Amazing). The Tick Tock diner within the hotel is open 24/7 and provides you with a huge menu, good food at reasonable New York prices. We would stay there again without a doubt.;4
Booked 3 nights here for the start of our holiday. Had 2 rooms 821 which over looked the Sheraton and freeway and 825 which had a view of City Walk and the Universal globe at the park entrance. We contacted the concierge to organise a pick up for us from LAX, which was smoothly organised through Deamline Limo Inc.They communicated all the way through the booking. Cost $90.00 for 4 passengers and 4 bags and avoided the stress of getting to the rental companies after an 11 hour flight and 1 hour wait at immigration. We also didn't need a car for the first 3 days. Organised car rental through enterprise, it's cheaper to book online than through the hotel ( about $100 difference), they have a office about a mile away and will collect you from the hotel.  Rooms were clean and large;4
Stayed for a few days with friends. Perfect location, just round the corner from Times Square. Room a little small but clean and shower was lovely and big. Doorman Jeff helped us out getting to the cruise terminal on our last day. Would recommend this to friends as a place to stay in NYC.;4
Nice hotel.  Staff was excellent.  Rooms were clean and well appointed.  I always dislike paying for internet, even though it was only $10 per day.  Coffee stand was small but service was great every morning.;4
Good hotel in the crossing of 54th street and Broadway, one of the best places if you are interested in theatre, live music or other cultural activities. A lot of restaurants, cafes and subway stations around. At night it's a little bit noisy if you are staying at the lower floors. We chose a big room and it was worth the higher price to have that space in the center of the city. We barely didn't had any relation with the front desk team, just check-in and check-out, but Elena was pretty helpful on those occasions.;4
We stayed at the Empire because it was the closest hotel to our family that we were visiting and it was within walking distance.  It looked like a very nice hotel.  We did not use the bar/dining area at all but it looked very nice.  The hotel was very accomodating and the people very friendly.  Our only issue was noise in the heater while we were sleeping.  It sounded like a small animal was crawling across the heater when we first heard it, i jumped up to look.  The coils made a noise every once in a while that would always keep us awake....thru the whole night. I'm sure other rooms did not have that issue, but ours did unfortunately.  I would definitely stay there again though, just make sure the heater does not make noise.....lol.  We did not have any view from our room;4
The hotel wins when it comes to staff and location. Good amenities (shops, restaurants) close by. The staff were brilliant throughout.  The room was small but perfectly fine and the cleaning staff excellent and helpful.;4
Located across the street from Lincoln Center and a short walk to subway and bus stops you couldnât find a better place to stay. Many restaurants from simple plain to dressy sophisticated are within walking distance. The lobby bar is very relaxing.;4
Check in was as smooth as butter. Mr. Ze at the front desk was courteous and awesome. Gave me a complimentary upgrade on my room without me even asking. I believe it was the fact it was my first time which was nice. Awesome view and room was overall clean. I believe the only complaint would be to have engineering install A/C panels in all the rooms. The fact I have to lift the entire flap covering the a/c unit is a bad look in the room. Overall a/c was good for being on the older side of units. Beautiful and awesome bathroom. The toiletries was by far the best I've ever had. Better than branded hotels!!!! Awesome pillows as well.;4
The hotel was good with some remnants of construction. The rate was high but the convenience of proximity to Universal Studios was unparalleled. Our room was clean and quiet. The hotel was nippy with a/c cranked but we were able to adjust our in room temperature. We had a great view from our room and the hotel booked us in without hassle. There is a shuttle that goes between the hotels and Universal, but if you are looking to go anywhere else you pretty much have to take a cab or uber. The hotel is not immediately close to other sites. Be sure to give yourself ample time when traveling between the airport as the traffic on the freeways is nuts! Overall, a great stay!;4
This is not likely to be the smartest hotel youâll ever stay in, but it is very conveniently located, and is good value for money.  Right near Penn Station so it is easy and cheap to get there from JFK.  Great local deli nearby, which is really convenient for a nice breakfast or late night snack.;4
We visited the new Yorker for a week in October 2018. It ideally located in central Manhattan just a short walk from the Empire state building. The diner is ideal and good quality food for all the family. The hotel suite we stayed in was perfect in size (6 of us) but does a little dated and tired feel about it but was very clean. I would stay again;4
Came in last minute, very tired. The young desk man, Isaac, was very pleasant, and even volunteered a AAA discount better than the coupon I had. Internet was instantaneous, and fast as mine at home. The TV was old but had a good picture, no interference or denied channels from those listed. Had a real bathtub, a fixation of mine. Room was small but clean, the A/C worked fine. No external noise. Best view from a motel I've ever experienced (hilltop). My expectations were not high, as I was just looking for a place to crash. But this was far beyond my previous experiences in this price range. Repeat business here. BUT...remember this is a motel, not a hotel. It's strictly for travelers who are not using this as their final destination. Any ratings should be thought of in terms of;4
Staff was very nice & helpful, especially the man at the desk when we checked in very late. Offered us late check out which was most appreciated. Hotel room was clean, comfortable & very convenient to Penn Station & Empire State Building. Bathroom a little dated - cracked tiles in floor.;4
The Jane has a wonderful classy feel to it, that you see the tiny rooms as an eccentricity. The free bicycles, excellent service, extraordinary restaurant and beautifully redone ball room - bar lounge make the visit worthwhile.   We stayed a week, and managed to get into a rhythm of when to use the black checkered tile bathrooms, when to  wash and hang out smalls to dry in the room (we took along a length of string and pegs so we had a way to hang other clothes too), what to use house keeping for etc.   Good qual wifi, TV and the aircon worked great. We wld have loved a bit more common space such as the roof top or courtyard, which are not available to guests. The bar was used at least three times for private events too, but being so conveniently located, we merely went out.;4
After reading all comments about this place on TripAdvisor.com, I thought that I might have done a wrong choice... some OLD comments were speaking about dirtiness in the rooms, unpoliteness of the employees, and insects everywhere! Well I must say that I didn't experienced anything like this! In the contrary, my boyfriend and I were very satisfied with the hotel. The room was clean and cosy, with a big television, hairdryer, ironing board and flatiron! The only negative aspect was that there were no wardrobe - so we decided to put some of our dresses on the open ironing board.  The personnel is very kind, everybody always had a smile for us and was happy to help and answer our questions.  Just something: watch out, the reception has a very powerful AC, in July it was freezing in;4
Location - ideal for Times Square. The surrounding area is nice, if very busy as expected. Good for Times Square and pretty close for broadway shows/ Central Park. The lobby is nice and pretty classy. Staff very polite and professional.  The room was small despite being a double-double for my family. Two double beds with not much extra space at all - small bathroom but large and nice shower.  the room had no tea and coffee making facilities but i was told i could get free tea downstairs during the breakfast hours - i never did- i need a tea to get me going in the morning, not once i'm up and dressed.  The elevator to the gym was faulty and i had to exit via the laundry - I've read reviews about the elevator - it seems to be an ongoing issue over time. There are three elevators;4
Great location. Staff friendly and helpful. Had a meal in the evening, which was very nice. Also had breakfast. Very busy. Go early or later. Plenty of availability of food and drinks. Good value for money in London. Evening drinks in lounge a let down due to queues, as not enough staff on duty. Other than this a good stat and would go back;4
I'm very surprised by some of the negative reviews. I stayed at this hotel for eight nights in June, and thought it was great for the most part. Some of the negative comments, it seems to me, may be coming from people who have never stayed in hotels in New York--nearly all hotels in New York are small (and, honestly, I didn't think my room was particularly small). The most important thing for me in a hotel is cleanliness--and this hotel was certainly clean. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was excellent (again, compared to other hotels in New York where I have stayed) The A/C was a window unit, and yes it was a little noisy (as those units tend to be), but I was actually appreciative because it helped block out some of the street noise on Central Park West (another;4
Close to Times Square and Central Park. Excellent location. Host Jeff was fantastic, super helpful and friendly. Even organized a car to the airport for us. AC was a bit loud at night otherwise a fantastic location. Would definitely stay there again.;4
Do not take the room over the loading dock. Unless you wish to be kept awake all night by garbage and laundry pick up and deliveries. Aside from that there is a good and also a good+restaurant on either side of the property. And the bar is excellent.;4
First timers, didn't know the city didn't know what to expect from the accommodation. Pleasantly surprised, friendly and polite staff couldn't do enough. Room was enough for our needs with a big tv, dining room suite and a couch. Easy access to the subway and walking distance to the park and loads of bars and restaurants. Fridge and toaster so bagels and fresh oj from the local supermarket made NYC breakfast a real treat. Last day they had a baggage service for 5 dollars which was a Godsend. All in great experience.;4
Situated diagonal to Madison Square gardens! 15 minutes from the Empire State Building and 10 mins from the start of the High Line walk. Ask for a high floor due to traffic noise. Beds were very comfortable! The Tick Tock Diner inside the lobby was great and really made you feel you were getting the 'American Experience!'';4
This hotel is an excellent location - 12 min walk to the Empire State and Times Square. Next door to the Subway. 5 mins walk to Macys.   We had room 2139 which had a lovely view onto the Empire State Building.   Staff were helpful and very friendly. Rooms were cleaned daily.   Only complaint is the $25 per night facility fee. This covers use of the wifi in the room, calls and use of the business and fitness centre. The wifi was poor for at least 5 of our 6 night stay (slow, wouldn't load pages etc) that we resulted in using international roaming. We had no use for the business centre nor the fitness centre and as for making calls, we utilised this facility only to get our 'moneys worth'.   This was a really disappointing aspect of the hotel.   The restaurant next door, Tick;4
Room was reasonably clean. Good size shower and bedroom.  We could even fit the babycot ij between the double bed. Bed was a bit too soft foe my liking.    I like the location. It's very near to central park and 15 minutes walk to times square.  I like it because it's onbthe quieter side of town. Would be more packed if it was any nearer to times square.   We requested for a baby cot and it was readily available in the room. Reception and concierge was very friendly and helpful. There's free coffee and tea every morning at the reception which was nice. Hot and iced water also provided at the water station at the lobby. This was convenient for us as we constantly needed hot water for the baby.   Housekeeping missed cleaning the room once or twice the whole week we were there but;4
For the price I paid, this hotel was more than satisfactory. The rooms, although a bit small, were well kept, tidy and the staff were friendly. The room I had (Single Cabin) would probably be a bit small for any extended period of time but for a few days in the city, it is perfect!;4
I stayed here two nights on a business trip. The location is good but definitely give yourself some extra time if you're flying out of JFK. It took us more than 70 min. and it wasn't even rush hour.   The rooms are sufficient for a good night sleep - my bed was comfy and the pillows soft and heavenly. Try to get a room in one of the higher floors (the hotel only has 12 floors). Mine was on the 2nd floor, facing the street, which meant I could hear everything going on outside.   Yes, the bathroom space is tight, but then this is NYC... space is a commodity!   P.s. I found the hairdryer in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. :);4
Weekend with young grandkids to visit Universal Studios.  Staff was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful.  Room was very spacing, as well as bathroom.  Bed was comfortable.  Would definitely come back for sure!!;4
It is the location that sells this hotel.  It is 10 minute walk from universal studious with a shuttle if needed.  Our room was on the first floor.  The beds were small nd the bathroom was a little dated.  Parking and internet cost extra and the hotel is extremely busy.  After our time there I am not sure the location made it worth the cost.  I probably would have stayed a little furthers from the park and found a nicer place for the price.;4
"I loved the rooftop pool and its atmosphere, the bar was very nice and the lobby was picturesque (as seen on GG) The lifts and wifi should be a priority, the pool could be cleaner and fix the room keycards but apart from that my stays were very pleasant. The location of the hotel is one of the main things that attracted me to it. You are close to everything; the subway, times square, central park, ect I've stayed at the Empire Hotel twice now, once October 2013 and June/July 2014, both stays were pleasant. I do admit my expectation were very high after watch Gossip Girl but a few things were lacking. Firstly, in my most recent stay the elevators were broken and the wifi was constantly slow or broken. These things are pretty important as walking down the stairs in the New York";4
the lobby does have the ambience of a night club. The room was okay but be careful that some of the rooms, while not so crammed, had very awkward structure. In the room where my friend stayed, the bed was just right next to the door and the desk made it impossible for people to walk from one side of the bed to the other. However, the overall ambience and service did somehow make up for the drawback;4
Stayed here for 3 nights in a twin bedded room - one double and one king size!  Bedrooms are large, very modern, very clean and very comfortable!  Bathroom with bath and over bath shower - no heated towel rail or extractor fan though.  Room not cleaned unless requested but didn't bother us.  Staff very friendly, polite and professional - nothing too much trouble.  Meal deal was very good value - Â£53 for two of us for two course meal with glass of wine or beer and full breakfast menu!  Lovely food, lovely restaurant.;4
Rented two suites and a standard room for the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. Standard room was more quite and had the coffee maker which was needed as temp's were in the teen's. Heater made very strange noises at all times when going on. Empty refrigerator. Traffic at night with trucks and emergency vehicles were bothersome. Breakfast on the roof top was very good accept for the kitchen fire and firefighters opening all the windows for ventilation in 20 degree weather.;4
We stayed for 3 nights in February as part of our honeymoon. The hotel is fantastically located close to Times Square. We were able to walk to the majority of the things we wanted to see (Times Sq, Macy's, Central Park, Broadway etc.) and we were able to easily get the subway to the 9/11 memorial and statue of liberty. The service was good from all at the hotel, and we also enjoyed breakfast in the Tick Tock diner, and a cocktail in the vault. Our room was on the 20th floor and although in was small, it provided all that we needed and was always very clean. We had a problem with a blocked toilet and it was sorted very quickly.  Overall a lovely stay for our first time in NY.;4
This is a nice hotel walking distance from the Universal Studios.  They also have a shuttle, though it is less than a 10 minute walk.  The rooms are nice, I had a corner room, though nothing out of the ordinary.  The staff was very nice and friendly, parking at $28 per night kind of steep.;4
This is very different property.  The restaurant area is under construction, so the bar area and hall way doubles as the restaurant.  Inconvenient when you are trying to walk through the area but not a total turn off.  Check in was quick and we were able to get rooms next to our daughters's.  The elevators are slow, but during peak travel times they have an employee in the elevator lobby and one in an elevator to speed things up.  One woman told us that she had been coming to the hotel for five years and the elevator was always slow.    The rooms were nice, but the hot water was spastic and it was hard to set and forget the faucet.  Also, the hotel is in LA so the low flow shower head was like a light rain. Enough to get you wet just not enough to do the job in a short time.;4
After reading all the negative reviews I have to say I was a bit concerned about this apartment block but boy was I surprised. Myself and my wife along with 2 sets of friends booked 3 executive studios and all 3 were spotless, warm and well equipped. The hotel staff were more than helpful and the location was excellant whether you wanted to walk or take the subway into Time Square and all the other main sites in New York.  We spoke to other people in the apartments who had read the negative reviews but were also pleasantly surprised with their apartment. If you are looking for a Hilton type level of quality and are willing to pay a lot more in NY then this might not be the place for you but at the price we paid it was well worth the money. We would all highly recommend the WooGo;4
We're NY suburbanites and had been a couple of times to the Empire's rooftop bar, which is kind of a happening place in nice weather, and thought we'd try staying some time. So we did. The hotel is old, but clean and nice. They make the best of what they have. We had no view but the beds were comfy. The staff, which we didn't spend much time with, was helpful and friendly. It's a great location if you're seeing something at Lincoln Center or on Broadway, and it's easy to grab a cab or hop on a subway if you want to go farther.;4
We were just in town for one night for a show at Madison Square Garden, so this hotel was perfect.  We took the train from JFK to Penn Station, walked a block to this hotel, then a block to the show, and back.    Room was super small, wifi was spotty.  Seriously, there are bigger sinks in airplanes!  But, the shower was full size and the room was very clean.  We spent 18 hours in NYC and this was perfect for our needs.;4
The room could of been a little bit cleaner, but other than that, the stay was very satisfying. The food at the hotel restaurant was great, as well as the drinks from the lobby bar. The staff was very efficient making check in and out quick and painless;4
"This property was pretty nice, I liked my room with a few exceptions: 1) I got a Queen Bed View Suite (40th/top floor), which I thought would look over the city, but instead looked over the river.  Also the windows in the rooms are not very large but that comes more down to it being an older building... and the bathroom for the ""suite"" is just o a fairly plain bathroom, with hot water so I thought the view suite was not really worth the extra money it cost.    The aspect of the suite that was really nice is the bed was in a operate room with doors, so someone could work while one person was sleeping - and the two rooms had separate thermostats.  It also had a decent desk and a small bar with a fridge.  The staff was super friendly and helped me get a room a bit early so I could";4
"Hotel is well located for Lincoln Center and surrounds. Room was reasonable. Bars OK, but not great - hard to get a seat at upstairs bar, and no consideration given to whether you are a house guest in the hotel (""we're a different company"" excuse) but ultimately di-able. Downstairs staff not that helpful.";4
Visted New York in September with my daughter for sightseeing & shopping. The hotel is ideally placed opposite Maddison Square Gardens at the corner of 34th & 8th. Everything in New York is walkable and you are only a short walk to Times Square, the Empire State & the Rockafella Centre.  The hotel is an iconic art deco building so rooms are old fashioned but clean and spacious. As this was a bitrhday celebration trip we were upgraded to a large 2 bathroom & 2 double bedded room. Note that plugs in the room are limited so we bought an extension lead. The hotel also gave us a free late checkout until 3pm, which was great as we had evening return flights. Staff were friendly & helpful.;4
If you're looking for a decent place to stay on a trip to LA, particularly if you plan on visiting Universal Studios, this is a pretty good choice.  Rooms are pretty big and clean.  They have an excellent restaurant downstairs, possibly the best buffet place Ive ever eaten at and believe me, Im not into buffet dining at all but this place goes all out.. They have a decent pool and jacuzzi and a shuttle that takes you right down to Universal Citywalk so there's a bunch of things to do down there as well as go to Universal.  Major highway next to the hotel so its easy access to other parts of LA and California...Self parking was a little bit pricey but considering what other choices you have, this was not too bad.  Youre either going to pay for a luxury hotel or a crappy budget;4
Great location in West Village near restaurants, bodegas, bakeries, jazz clubs. Old world charm set on cobbled street: seen in architecture design & decor through to staff uniforms. A few blocks from the 14th St & 8th Ave Subway. Very reasonable $ to stay in NYC but is basic and very small cosy rooms (think tiny ship cabin for 1). Door had deadbolt security locks and chain. General soap/hair shampoo/conditioner dispensers in shared bathrooms. Inhouse bottles of water in rooms can be replenished on request (unsure if tap water or filtered). Good wifi. Cafe downstairs has great satay dish. Hotel a block away from Whitney & close to Highline/Chelsea. Taxis go past fairly often. Great views in upstairs bar- party hotel on weekends. When the fan in my room burned out at 2am staff;4
We stayed in The New Yorker in July 2015 and was suprised by the old hotel. It was well looked after and it was great to read and see of the history of the hotel. The location was great as it was right next to MSG and an easy walk to most places. The sunset views were amazing looking towards the HighLine. The service was excellent;4
This hotel is a perfect choice right in Lincoln Center. It is also near fine restaurants, Metropolitan Opera House and Juilliard School. Staff are very kind and helpful. Next trip to New York, Empire will be our hotel.;4
"The only thing that kept this property from getting an ""excellent"" is that it did show it's age a bit. Otherwise, my room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and I had a great view of the surrounding hills out of the large windows. The location is great if you want to visit Universal Studios or the Citywalk area; both are an easy walk just across the street. I didn't dine at the hotel restaurant, but Citywalk has lots of options (Karl Strauss Brewery had great food and beer). I actually found the hotel service to be very good, I was surprised reading some of the other reviews; there were even employees standing at the elevators to guide us wherever we needed to go.";4
Hey having a great time in the hotel,  great rooms great views,  even extended my stay,  staff are doing a great job helping the front line staff, close to everything, I can even see the Empire State Building from my room.;4
Very small room as expected. I had to hire a small fridge to store my medication. Housekeeping very efficient and room was spotless. Never tried the in house diner. The best thing about the hotel was the location next to the subway station. My wife cannot walk far so we used the subway a lot to get around on our first trip to New York. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Great place to celebrate our Golden wedding.;4
the location is great just in LAX, fitness center excellent and rooms are cleaner and service really good, parking expensive and restaurant does not offer the best food also expensive and it offers a deli in the lobby;4
Only arrived yesterday 3 ladies 2 of us came to celebrate birthdays mine only 2 weeks ago.They really made our day upgraded to suite bottle of fizz and handwritten card saying happy birthday .The staff are wonderful can not do enough for you asked for a kettle and got a lovely coffee machine.We would definitely stay here again .;4
On arrival Mohammad checked us in and provided a first class service. He allocated a great room and as our trip was to celebrate a special birthday he arranged for a bottle of fizz. The hotel is in a very good location and the room was clean and perfect for our stay. New York has always plenty to offer and the location allows you easy access to all the attractions.;4
"I stayed at The Jane over Halloween weekend 2014 and I'd stay again. I was travelling alone so the cosy single room was fine for me; you're in New York City, why on earth would you need a huge room when you're hardly going to be in there? The space was still used economically and I never felt too hemmed in although I'm not sure I could cope in their bunk rooms with two people sharing the same space. My main worry was sharing a shower and toilet facilities, which I've never done before, but I never met anyone in there during my six nights' stay and the blocks were clean.  The hotel itself has a history, and this has been played up in the decor which is old-school wood pannelling and marble. The faded glamour, stuffed animals and shabby-chic might not suit everyone but if you";4
"We chose the New Yorker for its location, a two minute walk from Penn Station, from where we were catching an AmTrak train after our stay in New York. And Iâm glad we did, I really enjoyed four nights at a hotel with lots of character and history. We upgraded to an executive suite and had a great room - it was almost like an apartment! The room, and daily maid service, was excellent, and Iâd happily stop here again. Down sides: 1) a mature lady on check-in was quite curt and unhelpful; though other check in staff were very pleasant and helpful. Indeed, other than her, all staff were polite and helpful. But her attitude put a dampener on our arrival. 2) our room wasnât ready when we arrived, and they charged us $5 PER ITEM to store it for us while we killed time, so $20 in all. I";4
I liked to stay at Ameritania at Times Square. Good service, excellent staff... Very good value, excellent location! You can enjoy the area... But the room, isnÂ´t clean every day. We didnÂ´t have soap, shampoo...;4
We got a good deal to this hotel through lastminutetravel.com and was happy to get a room with a private bath for the price of a hostel in NYC!  The hotel is located on 106th and Central Park West, it is convenient to 110th and 103rd subway stations as well as plenty of buses that run near by.  We arrived really early in NYC since we caught a red eye plane and we showed up at the hotel around 9am to drop off our bags.  We were initially told we couldn't check in until 1pm at the earliest.  My husband had to do some last minute stuff for work so we sat downstairs in their small computer station area.  The manager saw that we were waiting for a room and was able to give us a room around 11:30 am. The room was small, a bit claustrophobic after the two of us were in the room with;4
My family and I stayed in an accessible room.  The hotel was located closed to Lincoln Centre, Central Park, Whole Foods.  Close to subway.  Pasquale from the front desk was very friendly and extremely helpful.  One thing I didn't like was the European shower head.;4
Really enjoyed our stay at the Hollywood Hotel this September! Great value for money and not a bad location for public transport and all the main routes - Sunset and Santa Monica Boulevards. Breakfast selection was just right and the freshly prepared omlettes were perfect every morning. We were given a nice room on the 3rd floor with balcony. the sun was on it most of the day and you could just make out the Hollywood sign in the hills! There are a few restaurants to eat within about a 15minute walk however we would recommend travelling a bit further to have more of a selection. The gentleman who works in the hotel gift shop was incredibly helpful with any questions we had about the area etc. We would be more than happy to stay here again! Thank you Hollywood Hotel;4
Maybe a typical NY hotel, small bathroom with no where to put your stuff, old building where the light blew out twice in the same day in the bathroom, hard to regulate temperature in the room. From desk, valet, and the people were great. Web site doesn't state there is a restaurant but there are two attached which both were acceptable. Location to MSG is prefect. Would do it agin;4
I had a good experience at this hostel.  It is conveniently located to the Hammersmith bus / tube station, and has an N9 bus stop directly to Heathrow nearby (convenient since there was a tube strike on my last day there).  I had shelving for clothes and a fridge in my room. Friendly staff, clean, relatively quiet! Lots of available information...what else could one need!;4
Gorgeous hotel. Lovely people. Shower design in bathroom is very poor and is a slip and fall risk. People with mobility issues should NOT stay in this hotel until the shower design is changed. Do inquire as to the shower setup if you are in any way of limited mobility.;4
Stayed at the hilton purely for the location, and that was excellent having the shuttle bus. Found the rooms a bit 'tired' and old fashioned, but beds comfortable. Check in and staff  All very polite and helpful, but when asked the transport desk for help with a shuttle to airport They couldn't see past their own transport for a charge of 70-80 dollars.   Went online and obtained a shuttle called prime time at a charge of 34 dollars.    Did have room service, and the food was excellent, we left on the Friday evening as they were setting up a buffet in the downstairs restaurant, which looked delicious.;4
I left the hotel only once in three days because I was attending an event AT the hotel.  I have no complaints other than wishing I got out more.   Here are a few observations/likes from my stay -  - The staff was always friendly and helpful.  - I had a corner room so I had more than enough space.  - The sushi roll I ordered for lunch one day was the most generous sized sushi roll Ie ever had and it was delicious.  - I loved that they had a coffee bar on the lobby level where the line was short, the coffee was good and the service was great.  - Definitely self park!  It's easy and convenient. Take it from someone who typical valets her car, don't waste the extra money.   I can't tell you if there are a lot of amenities because I was working a lot, jut it was comfortable, clean,;4
This hotel was in the absolute perfect location for my trip.  Central Park just around the corner and midtown not too long of a walk.  The hotel staff was courteous and the room was adequate for sleeping, which was my only purpose while in the facility.;4
Pros: The location is great, the room was tiny but clean and the staff was helpful. In addition, there was complimentary coffee every morning and cold water during the day.  Cons: The toiletries, except soap, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, were never refilled. The air conditioner in our room was very noisy. The safe is located on the floor in the closet and it's very unuseful since you need to get on the knees in order to use and access it. In addition, you cannot place your luggage in the closet because of that and there was no suitcase stand or other surfaces to place it rather than on the floor. The hotel charges $5 for every letter/parcel that you receive on your name. It appears to be a new policy and isn't mentioned on Booking.com (the info appears on hotel's website;4
The Empire hotel is a very trendy hotel in a not so trendy area of New York. I must confess I love upper West which is still gritty, next to Central Park or the Lincoln Centre. The Empire Hotel has a great location but is really famous for its designed lobby and roof terrace with swimming pool. I have been there twice, my first visit I was in a great room for New York, the second time I got a really great deal and got what I paid for..a bed with four walls around it.;4
Nice hotel, rooms with very confortable beds and balcony, a very good breakfast, and a very kind and friendly cook Hugo. I definetely recommend this hotel for visiting the area, altough not suitable if the goal is to visit themeparks as it is a little bit to far (except from Universal);4
Perfect location in time square near to central park, good time with good people particulary with Said, Majid and Jalal. Good quality of information from the entire team..  Guillaume/FranÃ§ois  Switzerland guys;4
Once I had booked the hotel, I rang the hotel leading up to my stay. I was unfamiliar with the location and wanted to get the best directions from LAX. I spoke to a really helpful guy who was working the front desk. His name was Michael. I was calling from Sydney, Australia and he assisted me with all my enquiries. He was even nice enough to tell me what the weather was like in LA. He definitely made me fell good about booking my stay! Great service and really friendly stuff!!!!;4
Great stay at this hotel the rooms are a bit dated but very clean as is the whole hotel. There are some seating areas in the lobby and there is security in the hotel . The hotel is across the road from Maddison square gardens and only a few minutes walk to the Empire State Building and Macyâs  Would definitely visit again;4
Astor on the Park, located on Central Park West, was a delightful boutique hotel located directly across the street from Central Park. My best friend and I spent four nights there enjoying the city. For the money - in New York City - it was more than adequate! It was clean and quaint. The rooms were small, but the bed was comfortable and clean. The bathroom was newly remodeled, the towels large and typical hotel toiletiers were provided (including a shower cap, which was nice). It's close to two subway stations, there's a great little grocery/deli down the street where we got 2 bagels and 2 cups of really good coffee for $4 - best deal in town. One night the elevator was broken, but they fixed it right away. We had read reviews of this hotel before we went that made us nervous,;4
So far it is a good stay and choice if you choose LAX as your gateway for departure. Very convenience location and just next to LAX , newly renovated design. Very cool rooms. It is good to try next time.;4
"my sister (in from San Diego and myself from Rhode island) stayed in this small gem for two nights. The room, #314, was clean, had two double beds with good linens, a small, but modern, clean, bathroom with room for ""stuff"", two large windows overlooking a courtyard, trees and cats , air conditioner that worked very well, amoire, decent t.v., hair dryer, ironing board, ice bucket, extra mirrors, etc, - everything you really need.  BUT, the reason we would definitely return to this hotel were the STAFF!!  They were all so warm and friendly and seemed like they genuinely wanted to make you comfortable. From directions that were spot on, to odd requests, Arie, Carmen, Sam, Hamilton and other employess whose names we did not have were the BEST!! This hotel is directly across from";4
The location of the Empire Hotel is great! It's not crazy busy at all hours of the day like in Time Sqaure. Great restaurants in that area, Columbus Circle has a shopping mall, and it's by the Lincoln Center. The staff was nice and our room is what we expected from looking it beforehand. Overall, great stay for three days!;4
We were happy with the size and cleanliness for an affordable NYC hotel.  However, we were unable to connect to WiFi despite attempts from staff and had to go to a Starbucks down the block to send some paperwork for work.;4
Regency Club had a poor selection of food item. Not worth $50. Previous stays I have truly enjoy the variety of hot and cold food that was available. It appears to save money, management has taken the approach, get the people in and out by offering lees choice of food (cold only) and lesser quality.;4
"Great looking bar and lobby in a wonderful location--steps from Lincoln Center and great shopping.  The bar staff could use a refresher course on hospitality and the front desk staff could benefit from a refresher course, as well; but overall the rooms were nice, the beds comfortable and the room service and housekeeping staff excellent.";4
Nice hotel and very comfortable bed. Room size is small but very organized and clean. We enjoyed it a lot!;4
I stayed here for 4 nights the hotel was fine for me. I had to switch rooms because one of the guest had a smoking room and I could smell the smoke in my room. The wall paper was peeling but that wasn't major. I had a view of the other guests windows. I enjoyed my stay there. One elevator was working and they are so small. I didn't have to wait to long for them. I was on the 4th floor. Ice machine was on the 11th floor. Hotel is upper east side close to Columbia University. Subway is within distance to get into the city. I was satisfied with my stay.;4
This hotel was in the perfect location. We had a really nice stay and felt it was very clean and comfortable. The tick took cafe had to be the best part. We felt like we had been transported back in time. Would really recommend this hotel. We're able to sleep in the city that never sleeps!;4
Despite the crazy prices to park, this is still the best place to stay only if you are going to Universal Studios. The park shuttle (no charge) comes every 15 minutes or so and it's a breeze to get to the park. I guess in theory you are saving the $25 to park at Universal Studio, so it's a push, but still is there really a need to inflate the parking charge that much.   Well, the corner room and bed were great and we had a nice view of the hills and the LA traffic. Otherwise, the lobby bar has half price appetizers at Happy Hour and no other issues for our quick 2 night getaway.;4
The location is fantastic to experience the day and night pulse of NY. A very convenient access to MRT Columbus Stn and the NW of the Central Park. The surrounding restaurants, convenient stores and Starbucks gave us our daily fill. A great stay for a 4-night stop in the city that never sleep.;4
Room on second floor was good size and reasonably clean. Very small lift. Toilets a bit of a walk from where we were but showers and kitchen nearby. This is a functional Hostel not 3 star hotel so no frills and impersonal atmosphere. Extra pillows delivered almost straight away. Small cafe in reception supplying basic food/drinks at reasonable prices. Easy walk to tube and bus routes. Only drawback was elderly gentleman in room opposite who was forever going up and down corridor in various stages of undress and leaving toilet door open!;4
Room for value was good. Pillows too soft. Elevators slow. Great location to Central Park, the subway and the Lincoln Center. I would stay again and definitely use the rooftop restaurant and bar next time a bit chilly in April.;4
We had a noisy room last time we stayed and mentioned it this time at check in. They upgraded us to a suite without any hassle and was.veryimpressed. Luis on the reception was exceptional and the position of the hotel is outstanding.;4
"Great location. Close to; Penn Station, Broadway, MSG, Empire State Bldg, Al Hirschfeld theater.  Our room was clean. Bed comfort was OK, not great. Room was quite small. $300 per night. We've stayed here before. Will probably stay again.";4
I found this hotel to be exactly what I needed.  It is well located, the staff overall were very accomodating and helpful.  The grounds are very well kept and secure.  Breakfast was included however the choices were very limited.  I would come back here again any time I am in the LA area provided it remains economical.;4
"The location was what sold this hotel for me; it is a stones throw from the 96th St Subway, which on an express train can get you into the heart of the city in around 2 stops. The local area is pretty quiet which is also a bonus; and there are plenty of places nearby to grab a quick snack or a coffee when needed (the 24 hour place over the road was a godsend after coming home from a night out slightly worse for wear)  The reception area is very pleasant and the staff that greeted us when we checked in were friendly and made us feel very welcome.   The room itself was lovely, and the beds incredibly comfortable although the decor is somewhat a little dated. Although, that said, we did not come to NYC to sit around in a hotel room criticizing the wallpaper. It got a little hot at";4
The hotel is nice, room is clean, at a great neighborhood. Drug store steps away is very handy. The restaurant is also great, good food, reasonably priced for the area.  The only thing not so great is the bathroom. First of all, the bathroom door cannot swing completely open because there isn't enough gap between the floor and the door. It's not a problem for single person use, but it's a bit problematic when you try to help a kid in the bathroom.  There's no exhaust fan in the bathroom.  The main problem is the shower. There's a nice rain shower head and also hand held shower, both very powerful. Unfortunately there's no shower door or even a shower curtain. Half of the shower has a glass wall, and the other half is wide open with a little curb at the bottom. No matter how hard;4
I booked this hotel as it was one of the ones recommended by Columbia University. I needed to be as close to Harlem as possible as I was involved in arranging a funeral. I had booked before reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, but after reading the reviews on this site, I'll admit I was panicked. I decided to bite the bullet anyway, as I had gotten a pretty good deal for NYC and couldn't afford to back out. I'm very happy I didn't.   What was great about the experience - I arrived a few days after one of the big snowstorms and it was flipping cold outside, but the room I stayed in was comfortably warm and flooded with sunlight (a corner room), in which I was quite happy to hibernate when I came down with a high fever & sore throat. I must have lucked out with the WiFi, because I;4
Had a 12 hour layover at LAX so checked in here. Very close to the airport and they provide a shuttle from LAX to the hotel which is just a few minutes away. Nice rooms. Decent food options. So much better than staying in airport all day.;4
The Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City is located very close to Universal City and offers a free shuttle to and from Universal about every 30 minutes.  The view from the rooms are panoramic.  The hotel restaurant serves a great breakfast buffet and lunch/dinner menu is very good as well.  Concierge in hotel is fabulous and very helpful. The only problem we had was with the elevators. They are in the process of putting new ones in and the old ones run slowly. An attendant usually rode them with us in case of trouble which was not very comforting.  All in all a pleasant stay.;4
Very concerned about staying at this motel after reading several negative reviews.  However, we were pleasantly surprised! The location is excellent, being across the road from the subway. Great bakery and fruit vendor across the road and supermarket one block away.. Room was a little on the small side, but very clean and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Bathroom also small but very clean and renovated. Air conditioning excellent and whisper quiet. The staff were most helpful. Would definitely stay here again!;4
"My son and I stayed here a total of two nights.  This hotel is in process of remodeling and our first night was in a ""before remodel"" room.  It was dated and in need of repairs/improvements but for a single night in New York it was perfectly adequate.  The bed was comfortable and we slept well.  The bathroom was clean and adequate.  If you are looking for granite countertops, fancy sitting area and lots of space, keep looking.  The room was about the size of a walk in closet but we didn't do anything there except sleep so not much room was required.  For the price we were quite satisfied.  Our second night was in an ""after remodel"" room and...wow.  Room was still small, holding a queen size bed and little else but again, it's New York and you shouldn't be holed up in a hotel";4
Stayed from 21st July to 25th July. When we arrived there was a short queue for check in. Reception staff are lovely and the lady was kind enough to give us a free upgrade as my mother and her had shared a birthday only a few day previous which started the trip off well. Security at the lifts were always lovely and never any problems with them never had this at a hotel previously and always felt safe.   Rooms as stated were a bit outdated and small but expected this as New York rooms tend to be tiny and we have no idea what we would have done if we had the smaller room. Nothing wrong with the rooms. Beds were comfortable dry comfortable. We had two queen sized beds. View was beautiful and lovely to see the Empire State Building. Only thing I would say is about the tv few;4
We didn't go to Universal Studios but went to Burbank (WB tour), city walk, and Walk of Fame area. This was the perfect location. For a 3 night stay, we only took our car out 1 time.  We walked or took metro the other times.  We booked standard king room but I'm not sure how (maybe being a HHonors member), we had a 20th floor (out of 22 floors) huge alcove executive room. We had a fruit platter with bottled water waiting in our room and received vouchers for breakfast and appetizers. What a WONDERFUL unexpected surprise!!    I will say the staff isn't the friendliest (front desk, concierge, breakfast staff) or the happiest, other than Jill in the Atrium Lounge (she's great!).  But for the upgrades, location, nice clean hotel, we'd come back if we're in the Universal City area.;4
We stayed here for 4 nights in February. Really convenient location for sight seeing..10 minutes to Hollywood/Beverly Hills area and about 30-40 to Santa Monica depending on traffic.  Hotel staff were always helpful and provided a printed directions for major attractions when we asked about the area (thanks Helen from MS).  On day 2, groups of teenage cheerleaders checked in (some of which ended up next door to us!) I immediately went to the desk and the clerk, Sarah, said she was sorry for the inconvenience and we were moved to the executive floor at no extra charge. Bell hop came to the room and we were moved within 20 minutes from the time I was at the desk. Really impeccable service...Weekend dinner buffet was delicious and worth the price.  Rooms were clean with great views;4
Me and my boyfriend recently stayed here for four nights. We got one of their suites with a jetted tub, which was essentially a jacuzzi in the room. Before you read ahead I want to stress that we loved our stay here, it was so convenient for us to do all of the generic touristy things. There were just a few niggles.  I'll start with the pros: - everything was very clean. - the suite was huge and the jacuzzi was a godsend- the jacuzzi also filled up VERY quickly. - breakfast was lovely with fresh waffles, an omelette station, and all the things you would expect from a continental breakfast too. - the decor was modern. - the TVs had lots of channels. - there was ample parking. - the bed was very comfy.  Cons: - the pool was essentially unusable. It was ice cold. When we got to the;4
We recently stayed at the Empire Hotel.  I had not stayed there for many years, and I was a bit apprehensive about this property.  However, it has been completely refurbished, and they are continuing to work on upgrading things like the Fitness Center.  We were very fortunate to be upgraded to a junior suite, and we had a very nice, spacious room with lots of amenities (bath robes, umbrella for our use while there, etc.  It was clean and comfortable, and when we had a problem with hot water, the maintenance person was there to take care of right away.  Our only issue was that we were on the first floor and the traffic noise at night was very loud.  The location is perfect--right across the street from Lincoln Center and next door to Central Park.  There are lots of restaurants;4
My husband and I visited The Empire on 11th August this year. After reading mixed reviews I can say I was thrilled with our stay here. On checking in we were congratulated by staff on our wedding and were upgraded to a kingsize room where we were met with a bottle of champagne. What a lovely start! The room itself was great, not what you would expect from a kingsize room in England but we already knew that New York hotel rooms would be smaller. The bathroom was small and the shower had no door but was nice enough.The hotel is in a brilliant location, very close to subway stations and around a 15 minute walk to times square, also close by is central park and along 9th ave (hell's kitchen) there are lots of lovely restaurants and bars.  We visited the rooftop club one night,;4
Had a corner room for two nights September 21st and 22nd. Room was larger than expected and very comfortable. Had a great view of the Universal Studios entrance. Was a five minute walk to the front gates. Bathroom was a decent size and the pool was nice. Front desk check in was easy and the staff was friendly.;4
We just stayed at the Ameritania Hotel from the 11/6 til the 20/6 as our first stop on our American holiday.   This hotel is in a fantastic location 6 blocks from Times Square so slightly out of the hustle and bustle of the night life but close enough itâs an easy walk in.   The hotel is surrounded by numerous metro lines to take you to all the sights of NYC.   The room we were in was a big retro style room overlooking 8th street. The bed was huge and comfortable with a good size bathroom.   The staff were amazing at the front desk and helped us with local eateries, entertainment and things to do during our stay.   The door lads were great and very friendly when we left and got back to the hotel. Special mention to Jeff who really went the extra mile with making us feel welcome.;4
Was not sure what to expect based on reviews here, but was pleasantly surprised.  The outside of the hotel didn't look like much- lobby was basic, carpet a little old, etc.  But, the room was clean and spacious, had two beds, just like we asked, extras in the bathroom (toothbrushes, tooth paste, slippers).  It really had everything we needed.  The location was also great- one block from the Subway, walking distance to second ave, E. Houston, restaurants, bars, etc.  Would definitely stay again!;4
The location is great....very close to everything... Access from the JFK airport is 1h approximately (Airtrain + Line E) Rooms are a little small but when it's only for sleep, it's convenient. Tick-Toc cafe was good...pancakes are awesome...mmmmmm Luggage storage is a bit expensive....$2 per piece of luggage ($1 when dropping them off, $1 when collecting them) Front desk is very helpful and gentle...security is present and make you feel safe within the hotel;4
We Stayed 2 nights while visiting Universal Studios. The room was nice but lacked towel bars and a fan in the bathroom.  I didn't want to pay the $30 for breakfast so I rented a microwave for $10 in the room and brought breakfast food with me. The coffee maker in the room didn't work so went down to the lobby where there is a Peat's coffee bar. I booked this hotel because they have a free shuttle and you can walk to the park. There was no despot when I booked 6 months out and I could cancel up to 72h before check-in. For those reasons, I didn't mind paying the price for the room. But It did look like they spent more money on the lobby than the rooms. And for the money, breakfast should be included.;4
Managed to get an early check in. Room was small (it is NY) but modern and clean. Lovely views towards Hudson. Bed was so comfy. Check in staff and concierge all very helpful - booked car for journey back to airport for same price as a yellow cab. Lovely art deco hotel - yes a little tired in places but still a beautiful hotel. Tick Tock diner next door very good too. Grocery shops nearby and a lovely pizza place across the road along with Starbucks. Coffee facilities in room would have been nice though. Location was really good, We normally stay nearer Times Square so it was nice to be closer to The Village etc - all walkable distance. Times Square was only about 10-15 walk. Have stayed many times in NY and would stay at this hotel again.;4
I had the absolute best nights sleep I've ever had in a hotel. I slept better than even my own bed at home.  Their bed and pillows are so super comfortable.  It's centrally located and near great restaurants too.;4
One of the nicest and wonderfully priced hotels Iâve had in New York. I traveled here for a birthday celebration and the location was walking distance from a subway station and great food. I would definitely book again.  Also shoutout to Jeff for being so kind and helping out during our trip!;4
I stayed here for a week in May.  I was very concerned with reviews at first but found the hotel to be perfectly fine.  It was a pleasant surprise in comparison to what I had myself prepared for.  The room was small (typical for NYC), as was the bathroom but that was actually a little bigger than I was expecting.  The room was immaculate with a comfortable bed and housekeeping service (clean sheets, towels, etc) daily.  The elevators were slow at busy times of the day, which is the same with any hotel.  The lobby was clean, subway/bus stops located a few steps from the hotel, as well as cabs available, and a 24-hour Duane Reade drugstore next door (at corner on Broadway).  I used all forms of transportation during my stay and never felt unsafe coming or going at any hour of the;4
Yes the rooms are not necessarily the best not helped by the tired carpets when you walk out of the elevator but the New Yorker remains a great location being so close to Penn Station and a hotel with great tradition.  Staff are alway most helpful and accommodating, I love finding another nugget of memorabilia from times past and it simply works when I visit as it has such easy access to both metro and Long Island Rail Road.;4
Needed to change rooms.  First room had been sprayed with disgusting potent air freshener.  Not as clean as expected.  Was really old and dated and very loud air conditioner.  But were changed to an acceptable room with no problem.  Rest of stay good.  Excellent location with easy transportation and plenty of good places to eat.;4
I have stayed at the Days Inn-Broadway on 94th St before, and I was recently reminded how much I was impressed with both the staff and location. It is on the Upper West side close to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim museum (just a beautiful walk east across Central Park). There is also a wonderful deli right across the street and a couple of newly renovated restaurants. I tend to spend most of my Manhattan time south of 50th Street and Broadway and this hotel was very close to the 96th subway station that can get one to all parts downtown!;4
"My stay at the Empire was for a business trip.  The location of the hotel was perfect.  It's within easy distance to attractions via foot, taxi (uber), or subway.  There are multiple restaurants and a Whole Foods nearby.  The staff was very prompt when there was an issue; however, dealing with those issues was at times complicated and took multiple staff members and a couple of days.  I also arrived early to the hotel (they graciously stored my bags).  They were supposed to notify me when my room was ready, they never did.  It's not truly that big of an issue, but if you state that you are going to do something, follow through.  The only issue we had with the hotel room was that our 11th floor room air conditioner was unable to keep up with the temperatures of summer time New";4
Excellent location, in walking distance to Times Square, major theaters & restaurants.  Courteous staff. Yummy diner & Italian restaurant attached to lobby. Free WiFi. Pretty cheap, less that $200 for a last minute Friday night stay-over.  Clean & Quiet. Subway & Bus stop right outside lobby door.  Felt safe even at night and I was a woman alone. The 1930s/40s Art Deco Retro dÃ©cor made me feel sophisticated and wealthy, lol. I LOVED my stay.;4
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week July 28th - Aug 6th with our four year old. We were given a corner room with a king bed.  What we liked about this hotel: - SERVICE: staff at the front desk, guest services, valets and concierge provide excellent customer service. We purchased our Universal Studios tickets through the concierge and got a great deal as we had a pass for two days purchased for the regular price of one day admission - ROOM: very spacious, clean with a huge bathroom and a convenient separate counter which i loved for applying make up, hairstyling etc; had an AMAZING view (from the tenth floor). Beds and pillows were THE most comfortable we have come across at a hotel.  - FOOD: we ordered food by the pool which was always delicious (reasonably priced);";4
This is my second visit to the Hollywood Hotel. Check in was friendly and efficient. The room is clean, pleasant and beds are very comfortable. The overall environment is good, and there are places to sit, rest, and read. Haven't used the pool, it's too cold right now. I like this hotel and will come back again. Good safe and secure parking. Quiet, we have no disturbances. Very well located for ease of access to anything in LA. Thanks to Sonia for lovely omelettes and Oralia.;4
Our room wasnât big but it is New York.  Great location & the availability of food so close is a bonus. Close to Penn Station so easy access . Madison Square Gardens is across the road & all the tour buses are close. Easy walk to Tim Square;4
We stayed at this hotel as it is close to Universal studios (it's a 10-12 minute walk). We found this hotel was quite comfortable, although it is a little noisy in the morning as it is right on the highway. The breakfast buffet was really good with a wide variety of things to eat. The parking is a little on the expensive side, and they seem to discourage guests from self parking. Other than that, a good hotel if you are visiting Universal studios.;4
Stayed here March 18-25 with my mother. We had stayed here last year and loved it and since we needed to be in the LA area again we decided to stay here again.  This year I booked on line for a room on the executive level... Although my pre-paid reservation was for a room on the executive level they didn't have any available when we got there so we were in a room on another floor. (We were assured the rooms were actually the same.)  We were given the key to access the executive lounge however, until I advised the front desk two days into our stay, we were not receiving the turn down service or the daily newspaper we would have received if we had actually been on the executive level which is what my reservation was for.  The executive lounge had a nice continental breakfast -;4
My father and I came to spend Thanksgiving in LA with my brother and his wife and I chose to stay in HH because of the great value for the rooms and proximity to my brother's place which was only a 10 minute walk away. All staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Dena who was charm and service personified! Her tips for Universal Studios and local sports for breakfast were extremely helpful! The only faults I had were the lack of breakfast and restaurant/bar facilities, and the fact that the pool wasn't heated. Otherwise, a very pleasant stay and will definitely return again next time I'm in the city of angels!;4
We stayed here for three nights while in NY for a Billy Joel concert at Madison Square Garden. The property needs updating, but our room was comfortable, the staff was excellent, the price was reasonable, and security was great (always someone on duty checking room keys before you could get into the elevator).  This hotel was built in the 1930s and a good deal of the charm remains.  The location can't be beat, kitty-corner from MSG/Penn Station and within walking distance of Times Square, Empire State building and, if you're game, Rockefeller Center. Lots of decent restaurants and bars nearby.  Check out the bar in the basement, occupying a space once used by a bank. You can even get a table in the vault! The service there was excellent, as with check-in, cleaning staff, etc.;4
This is where I will be staying next time I visit Manhattan. Wonderful staf and very nice room. Great location to the subway and that is the absolute best way to get around.  I have stayed at other hotels on Manhattan but this hotel is where I will be staying again. The bed was big and comfortable and the room big. The bathroom in very fine condition. The staff was wonderful and very helpful always with a smile on their face. I couldnÂ´t be more satisfied!;4
Came into NYC for a conference.  Empire hotel was a pleasant surprise- right next to the Lincoln Center, easy access to transportation.   Enjoyed my stay and likely to return to this hotel on subsequent trips to NYC.;4
the location of this hotel is perfect to me. It can be reached timesquare, central park, 5th avenue, as well as subway easily. Nearby, there are a lot of restaurants and one 24-hour supermarket.   the neat of hotel cleaning is ok. the reception service is average only without smile (am i doing something wrong ?!) . no wifi in room but in lobby, please get prepared before if you are going to online in room.   everything needs to pay in room , including bottle of water. but the hotel still offers water in lobby that is appreciated for such dry weather.   the people staying at the gate whose attitude is much better than those in reception. They are helpful and friendly.;4
Overall the trip was average. But because of Hugo, the breakfast cook, who is the man! ... I'm giving this a very good. He is fast and efficient and does a great job.  Rooms were decent, but old and the soap tray in the shower is broken causing me to cut my knee... And there is a pillar in the middle of the room, which was awkward. There wasn't any power near the desk so I couldn't work in my room for extended periods of time.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker 13th Dec to 17th Dec. Check-in was a smooth process with friendly staff. A security deposit was taken and we didnât have to pay the facilities fee as we booked with Virgin Holidays. If you are looking for a reasonably priced accommodation look no further than here. It doesnât have the wow factor but it does have comfy beds and clean rooms with great housekeeping.;4
Stayed here for 5 nights. Great location, previously always stayed in Times Sq but that is tacky compared to Upper West Side location. Great hotel, very funky dÃ©cor throughout, has a relaxed vibe about it. Room was small compared to other hotels I'd stayed in but very comfortable. Room was a little shabby in places but clean and maids did a good service.;4
When I couldn't find a good price at my favorite budget place in New York, Hotel Newton, tripadvisor reviews led me here and I'm glad they did.  EasyClick Travel gave me a weeknight double room for $75 all taxes and fees included.  It was great.  Clean, renovated, comfortable bed, nice sheets, good bathroom (no hair dryer), plenty of hot water, friendly staff, and an UWS location perfect for my needs.  You won't be sorry you stayed here for what it would cost just to park your car at some other places.;4
Good hotel for the value. Location was great.  Easy check in and out. Good premier rooms. The housekeeping did not come during our entire stay. Not sure why, but it was okay because we really didnât need it.;4
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It has a great location. Room was very clean a spacious. Only downside were that beds are not doubles , so if your sharing you won't get much room!  We enjoyed visiting Tick Tock Diner next door.;4
We had a great check in with friendly staff. Room was comfortable and had frig. TV was large and decor was nice and updated. I love being close to the airport and not being able to hear the airplanes! Also loved the cylinders with lights out the window - so fun to watch! We had a drink at the bar and the staff there was wonderful - very accommodating and friendly. It was a great stay, but there was an extra charge for $119 for breakfast on my invoice. Yikes! I am still waiting for it to be rectified so be careful and watch your charges!;4
Right across from Central Park and three blocks from the 103rd street subway sits this little treasure, overlooked by many, I'm sure. The receptionist couldn't have been nicer. The lift to my eighth floor room moved slowly up. The room was immaculate: three pillows stood like sentinels watching over everything. Comfortable bed. Clean bath with shampoo and all the needed fixin's. Hair dryer. Although the building is old, it's been modernized. Free local phone calls. The only downside was a lack oF a hot water kettle, no fridge in room, and wifi charges of US$10/day.;4
Very grand hotel with a great gatsby feel to it, our room was a little on the small side - but it was perfectly clean and bed was comfortable which is needed after long days sightseeing. We had some trouble with the shower not running very hot on out first day, but it seemed to fix itself after a day. Hotel were very accommodating to my request of a complimentary upgrade to help celebrate my fiance birthday.;4
Even with a overbooked hotel, they managed to give a great service. Will definitely go back. Best located hotel in NY. In the middle of downtown. Just park your car and walk everywhere. We stayed on the 21st floor, kids wanted to stay in the hotel and look out the window.;4
I visited NY with my mother and got this hotel. It was really good, location is amazing and overall great service. We had an unfortunate situation with other guests but it was solved quickly, and the hotel made sure we felt safe, special shout out to Alexis, she was so nice to us and made sure everything was perfect;4
The  es Yorker is a very nice hotel where we ha e stayed many times. Walking distance from Penn and easy to go uptown or downtown. The rooms are variable as to size and the type you pick doesnât seem to make a difference in what you get. I feel the hotel doesnât give you any extras for the price you pay. No coffee in room unless you add $25 a day. No water unless you pay $5.00. The facility fee is outrageous but they all do it.  So watch your pennies here and shop around. Housekeeping was outstanding. And there are restaurants...3 attached so you donât ha e to go out.  Great if you have kids.    If you get a good price and want the location and donât care too much about your room size this hotel is friendly clean and secure.;4
Had an awesome stay here. Close to public transport and not far from most tourist things. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Hugo who cooked breakfast every morning.   Would recommend.;4
A 2 night stay on the 22nd floor with amazing views.  On 8th Avenue it is a prime location in easy reach of the subway to anywhere you would want to go.  A block away you can see the Empire State Building. A couple of blocks to Macy's store.   The hotel rooms are small and basic with a shower over a bath. The bed linen is high quality.  No one seems to mind you taking food to your room and you can get anything from coffee to a full take away there are so many places to buy food.   The reception area is very grand and the staff are polite, welcoming and knowledgable. Our room was not ready until 4pm but check out is mid day so this maybe a common occurrence.   I would stay again if I were to go to New York again.;4
I would definitely recommend this hotel as an economic and nice hotel to use as a base for exploring New York. Reception staff very friendly and informative. Canât recall the gentlemans name who welcomed us on arrival on tuesday 10th but thanks for your warm welcome. Bellmen very friendly wishing us a great day on our way out each day. Jeff is one particular name I recall being very friendly and helpful.  Our room was very clean. Contrary to what we expected from the hotel literature we did have WiFi in the room. The room also had a safe which is always a welcome addition. The hotel is very handy for 7th Avenue subway station. From there you can take the E line all the way to the JFK air link at a cost of 2.75 USD for the subway (free if you have an unlimited use metro card) and;4
Stayed here for 5 nights in September to celebrate my 30th Birthday and we werenât disappointed. The majority of the staff were friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much. I must give a special mention to both Jeff and Javier who were fabulous. Javiers cocktails were fantastic and such a lovely man who made my birthday evening special.   The hotel room was spacious (we paid for a delux) and the bed was HUGE, much to our surprise as we had been told NY hotel rooms were always small. Th decor was great, a few bits in the room which had seen better days and were a bit tired but this didnât spoil the overall stay.   Location was perfect and I would certainly stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting the city.;4
I am a young opera singer, and I travel frequently to NYC. For the price I paid, I had a lovely room...spacious and very clean and new. I was a bit concerned with some of the reviews I read this morning, and I wonder if they are reviews for the WooGo Midtown, not the Woogo Central Park. I really found it to be lovely and in a great location. I had an NYC friend come and see me who also said it was a fabulous hotel for NYC - plenty of space. I stayed on the 9th floor. I am wondering if I just got lucky with that particular room....but I would recommend the accomodations that I had. I do have to say that the staff didn't bother to bring me a hairdryer, but other than that the experience was A+. Very clean, new fixtures...nice appliances and spotless fridge.;4
"I stayed at Empire recently for a business trip. Accommodating staff. Perfect location. Rooms a bit outdated but theyâre working on updates. Plan to stay again soon. All staff is friendly but front staff; AJ & Danny are amazing!";4
Amazing location, 5min walk to Times Square. Very kind service, always helpful. Modern, renovated rooms. Clean. The only issues are noise (dificult to sleep) and medium quality materace, ok for short stay. In general very happy, good value for money.;4
Location is perfect! Itâs near subway and train stations. Restaurants are walking distance from hotel. Broadway, Times Square too! Right across my room are the view of Madison Square, Empire State Building and Rockefeller Centre.;4
Several friends and I chose the Hilton in Universal City to be our base from which we could do some tours in Hollywood, and it worked out very well for us. It's in a much nicer (safer) location than the Hollywood hotels.  Our rooms were all nice and clean with lovely views of Universal Studios or the Hollywood hills, and the price was reasonable. I stayed in a double queen room (619), because I was told by the front desk staff that the king rooms weren't updated. That turned out to not be true as one of my friends had a king room and it was very similar to mine but with more free floor space.   The breakfast buffet was good, but not a lot of options if you're trying to watch carbohydrates. On day 2, I chose to order off the menu, which i think was a better choice. Either way,;4
Late review. We picked this hotel for the location, because we visited Hollywood,Beverly Hills and Universal. My family and me got very satisfied with the experience. Good service, safe and clean.  Definitely coming back.;4
We were 3 high school girlfriends (1954 graduates) having a mini-reunion in NYC.  I made the reservation, but then after later reading some of the reviews, prepared for the worst, including bugs, filth, crabby help, and noise.  Instead we found no bugs or  trace of them, a very friendly and helpful staff, and a sufficiently clean and quiet room.   The location was out of the center of things but the price was right and the subway was right around the corner.  We had a double bed & single sleep sofa.  The mattresses weren't top notch but we didn't wake up half paralyzed so they sufficed for a two-night stay.  We didn't use the stove but the refrigerator worked and the small bathroom was attractive, clean and functional.  We could live with a few carpet & sofa stains and the price;4
My husband and I stayed for a week at the end of August. Miguel at reception kindly upgraded us as we were there during our wedding anniversary.   We have stayed before and the room we were in this time was far better. Our room was an executive room on the 8th floor with an amazing view of the Empire State Building (room 837). It was more spacious than the last stay in a metro room. The room had a much more modern shower room and a coffee maker. The room was kept very clean during our stay.  The best thing about this hotel is the location for the tube/trains. It is also near to Macys and MSG. I also like the fact that you have to show your room card to get in to the lifts. There are a lot of hotels in NYC where security is too relaxed.  The hotel bar/restaurant was open during;4
Nice clean hotel. Staff were friendly. Location was great.  Cafe over road (slightly down hill) is AMAZING! Well Priced, Amazing food.   Room was a good size, Location was great, Metro stop in just across street, easy access to all of New York. Highly recommended for price;4
I stayed there for 5 nights from the 11/01 to the 16/01/2012, we arrived a little early as our flight got in slightly earlier, had to wait about 30minutes as check in timing is about 3pm, no biggie, when we got to our room we had booked the junior queen suites, it was spacious equipped with working fridge & microwave oven. The front desk was nothing spectacular but i can't fault them on anything, they were efficient and informative when i requested for directions.  The rooms themselves were clean with the turn-down service was done daily, which lead me to my gripe that there was no in room safe nor do not disturb signage. We had a lovely view of the court yard but wished they provided us some in room slippers so we could make use of the patio without having our feet make contact;4
Even being one of New York's older Hotels, our stay was fabulous and very clean. The beds were above what we expected and even a refrigerator that actually cooled well. Three great restaurants on site and one is even open 24hrs a day. I will defiantly stay here again!;4
We recently stated at Wydham New Yorker during our 1 week trip to New York. The hotel was approximately 45 mins from JFK airport. Uber cost approximately $65. The hotel is located on 8th and 34th- perfect location. From here you are able to walk to Macy's and penn station within 5 minutes and Times Square within 10. There are several food options around including McDonalds & Starbucks across the road, and an amazing bagel bar (on 35th). Both Duane Reid & CVS (pharmacies) are next door- also selling snacks and soft drinks. Most places around are open late, if not 24hrs.  The staff were very informative however beware- they will charge you a daily fee for phone use, wifi and gym access. We were told it was $26 per day but when we questioned this, it was quickly reduced it to $10.;4
"Stayed here overnight after landing from the UK and very pleased. After an initial ""blip"" where the room given had clearly not been checked - wet towels on the floor and an empty champagne bottle by the bed ...... the subsequent room was very good. Spacious and clean. Good shower and bed. What else do you need? We had a snack in the bar/restaurant and perfectly nice with cheery staff. The promised early morning call never materialised - could have been a disaster with an early morning flight to catch - but thankfully we had set alarms (although were totally confused and worried they would go off at the right time as it was the night Daylight Saving kicked in!) Bit niggled to get to the shuttle bus to the airport to be told it had been ""booked by a party"" and we had to wait for";4
This hotel is what you expect of a Hilton hotel. It's clean and modern and the rooms are up to date. It's as close as you can get to Universal Studios and I recommend walking to the hotel and not taking the team or shuttles as it ends up taking longer than just crossing the street. We were 4 people and the room and it was not cramped at all. Downside: they were fixing the elevators and only 2 function for a fairly large hotel and a very packed lobby so you are waiting for elevators to go up and down quite a bit. The hotel does tell you this when you arrive. However, I went to universal about a year and half ago and stayed at this hotel and they were fixing the elevators and somehow the elevators are still being fixed and no progress has been made. Plus side: there is a pete's;4
Although the hotel interior is dated by 2010 standards our 48 hour stay was pretty good. The location re proximity to Universal Studios is brilliant.. We arrived from Australia at 10:30am. Check in immediately (no waiting) and our room was ready! A stroke of good luck for us. The room was modest in size with 2 double beds my only complaint as we were on the premium floors. it included a generous continental breakfast. The pool area was gorgeous. Again modest but well maintained with a beautiful garden, lawn, and cabanas. For our brief visit it was quite good;4
We liked the location of the hotel, right next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Also, having plenty of small places to get food in the immediate vicinity makes it very convenient. Our room was bigger than we expected, and even had a little bit of a view. Some of the furniture if obviously a little older, but still good. What we did not like was that fact that there was no caulking around the bathtub. This just looks ugly, and is something that could be fixed in less than 5 minutes. Not sure why management does not care about this. Also, the three of us only had two sets of towels. Again, if you have a reservation for 3, it should be easy to prepare the room accordingly. To make matters worse, we called for more towels, but none were ever delivered. We picked some up;4
I visited New York for my 21st Birthday. We booked this hotel based on reviews we had read and it's location.   Location is perfectly central, opposite the Madison Sq Garden it provided excellent views. We were within walking distance of everything and right next door to the subway station which we used every single day and really got the hang of it! Life saver!  Excellent service and excellent wifi. Very clean. Bedroom was brilliant size with everything we could of wanted. Only negative (which isn't really a negative just personal opinion) is that the bathroom does need updating. A little shabby and old fashioned looking with a poor shower. Never the less it did the job and we were happy!  As for the hotel over all it screams New York! Classic looking lobby, spacious, helpful;4
comfortable rooms, if a little small, excellent room facilities, shower etc. Very convenient to major tourist sites, shopping, theatres etc in Manhattan. Air-Con was a bit noisy. Friendly and helpful staff. Overall very happy with our stay here;4
Was recently in NYC with a friend. After staying with some friends on the upper east side for a week then staying with another friend down in Brooklyn for 5 days, having our own space was something we were both looking forward to. Our personal experience was great. PROS:  Cheap. Keep in mind, this is New York, where nothing really comes cheap and there are places that are constantly booked up. This was the cheapest available hotel we could find that was not a complete dive or a hostel where we'd be sharing a room with nearly 12 people. For the location, the helpfulness of the staff, and the amenities, the price was perfect.  Location, location, location. This hotel is in a great spot. Our room (609) overlooked Central Park, a great view to wake up to in the morning. The hotel is;4
great remodel and excellent location and great food and handsomely done rooms, however, noisy from room next door.  Not sure if there is inadequate insulation but I never have the issue of hearing next door occupants and it was disturbing.;4
I visited Los Angeles last December for business, the hotel is a very good representative to the Hilton brand which is home away from home, room spacious, good choice of TV channels, spotless clean, dreamed to have the bed back home with me, had dinner at the pub and the restaurant  which was having plenty of choices but somewhat expensive, breakfast was great in a big hall, we were served immediately with a lot of choices that gave a good start of our days. The hotel was so near to the entrance of the universal studios, has a shuttle bus to the park, and has a desk for reservation to save precious time and save you additional day, please go early to catch all the fun especially the new rides, would dream to come here again but with my family next time.;4
Great location. Old style, loved it. The rooms aren't 21st century big, they are 1930's luxury, so take that into account. The staff were great, the room was spotless, bed was comfy. Free wifi in the room. I'd use this hotel again. Close to sandwich shops bars and restaurants. Over the road from Penn Station. 3 blocks straight down to Empire State Building.;4
The location of this hotel is great. Located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. We walked to Time Square from the hotel and it was not that far. There are a lot of places to eat and shop right in the area.   Check in process was seemless, no waiting and friendly service. Security is very good at this hotel, no one is allowed to the elevators without a room key. The room was small. We traveled with 2 children so it was a little tight but it worked. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. I paid an upgrade fee for my room but not sure that I would do that again. The description said it was updated however the bathroom was very dated. We had no issues with hotel staff during our stay.  Tick Tock Diner is very convenient for breakfast as it is located in;4
My girlfriend and I stayed here in October 2013.  The room is absolutely tiny however this is expected and you get used to it.  The bunks are snug but there is free wifi, a flat screen tv for each bunk and the hotel even hand out free ipads or laptops if you need one.  There are also free bike rentals outside the hotel and the Riverside Park is across the road for cycling.  The location is excellent in the popular West Village/Meatpacking District and only a few minutes walk away from the excellent bars and restaurants in the area.  The Highline is also only a few blocks away.  Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in a decent value hotel who is planning to spend most of their time out and about and only sleeping as its not the sort of room you can chill;4
Great location first and foremost, nice rooms. But like everything in mid town you pay for it - pay for WiFi, pay for in room coffee, silly things but when you're paying these rates you expect more. Room is nice, staff is tops, but location is A+++;4
I booked this hotel for my family and I last week.  I live in New York so I knew the area and was fairly sure it was a good deal.  Then I read some negative reviews here and freaked out.    Here is the truth: The room was nice, clean, roomy, and quiet.  Sure, compared to a Howard Johnson in the suburbs, its TINY, but if you know anything about New York, you'll know that the room was actually roomy.  Actually, the bathroom was bigger than my New York bedroom.  The AC worked well, was no dirty or noisy.  We were right next to the elevator and never heard a single sound from the hall or the neighbors.  The area is great...Central Park West is pretty much the most upscale part of New York.    The staff were also really nice.  They gave great directions and came together and went;4
My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and it was lovely, a little wait for check in but that was fine. The room was super small, but hey, when you're in New York that's really the last place you want to be! Lots of amenities right on your doorstep.  The hotel is full of history, lots of original features here which is great, apart from you can hear all the neighbouring rooms turn a tap, turn a handle, flush the toilet, very hard to stay asleep when you can hear this, but we saw past that. Staff were all very friendly, hotel very well maintained and clean. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip.;4
Took the Family to universal studios and always try to find a Hilton.    Great service!    Rooms were clean.  Beds were very comfy!   Great wifi!  Food was good as well.    Excellent shower pressure as well.     They were working on elevators while we were here, but they didn't seem to affect us too bad.;4
Location is the best as far as eating,shopping,watching opera, musicals,circus,ballet and if you need bank, itâs there. Pharmacy, itâs there.All of above, everything is walking distance. Even you want to go farther, easy to get public transportations.;4
We got a really good rate by prepaying and stayed 5 nights.  The hotel is small enough so you feel that you are valued and the staff couldn't have been more attentive. The decor is charming and fun - if you want bland boring chain hotel vibe then this isn't the place for you.  We had a room with 2 doubles.  It was small but absolutely fine for what we needed as we weren't in the hotel much.  The beds, pillows etc were really comfy.  My only issues were that we had no ventilation in the bathroom so it got really steamed up and as a result the paintwork was peeling and shower tiles moving.  Also there was no temperature control in the room.  Our room was slightly cold but actually we probably slept better as a result. I am told that the hotel is being renovated so maybe they;4
"Me and my boyfriend had a really nice stay at The Empire. The staff is really nice, helpful and friendly. The room was clean and we had a really nice daily room service. The only problem we had was with the lack of information about what is really complimentary and what is not. The coffee and tea in the room was only free at the first round, but the room service kept loading it without we order it, so we had a misunderstood at the check out about it, but it was also quickly solved with the hotel staff. Also we had to order sometimes the complimentary daily water, that wasn't always left in our room. During mornings I recommend the ""do not disturb"" sign, because the room service keeps knocking at your door and makes a lot of noise cleaning the rooms around you.  We were worried";4
Firstly, this is not a cheap hotel. It's one of the most famous in New York so of course it isn't, but it is a very good hotel. Once we had moved rooms (the first one was the size of a stamp and had the view from a mail box) my mum and I had a spacious room with two big beds, large bathroom, very powerful shower and a nice view looking west. The New Yorker is in a good location for most of Manhattan, check in was easy (although check out was done by an extremely miserable lady), the small museum downstairs is worth seeing for a few minutes and the building itself is a beautiful art deco construction. Downsides? A few. The wardrobe (closest) in our room, 3039, didn't have a light in it which is moronic, and the bathroom door handle on the inside has to be pushed about 150 degrees;4
Close to Penn Station, I always enjoy staying here for business travel in NYC. The coffee maker, bathroom & room size make it worth it to upgrade to the executive room if you can. And the on-site dining options are convenient as well (diner, bar/trattoria, and upscale steakhouse) Nice views & martinis!;4
This is a great budget choice. The location, just a block from the beginning of the High Line, is excellent. Before you book you should know that the rooms are small. Tiny. Minuscule. Even for Manhattan. I stayed in a bunk bed room with shared bathroom and really, this is not a place you want to hang out and relax. But you're in New York, so why would you want to hang out in your room? Bathrooms are clean, the rooms are nicely made up with robes, slippers and drinking water.   For me one of the big perks at the hotel was the free bike usage. They are one-speed clunkers but the island is flat. It is an easy ride to the WTC site and the Brooklyn Bridge. My friend and I also rode up and across Central Park to visit some of the museums. If you have nice weather and are used to city;4
Very friendly, accommodating staff. Our room was ready early and they were happy to store our bags on our check out day. Clean and great location, especially for the price! We were easily able to walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park.;4
"this is my second stay at HH. I actually have mostly warm feelings about the place. The decor is classy and relaxed. The room is... Fine. Clean. The beds are comfy. Breakfast is surprisingly varied and plentiful. There is a lovely courtyard and the pool is comfortably appointed with cushioned sunchairs and pool towels. The staff is mostly competent and mostly friendly. If you have friends in silver lake, echo park or Los Feliz, this hotel is about a 4-7 Uber ride from those hoods. This brings me to my final and only negative point: shuttle service.  Do not get the shuttle to the airport. First, it requires a $5 cash ""deposit"" which turns out to be no refundable. My shuttle was 15 minutes late and literally took me an hour out of the way to pick up another passenger.  It's 19";4
Old but good hotel . Room size ok . Bathroom bigger compared to other hotels . Amazing location . Restaurant has variety of options. Again , compared to thee hotels , staff is better , helpful and pleasant. Looks like one of the 60s premium hotel . Value for money .;4
Getting to the hotel is the easiest journey I've had on this current multi city tour of the States.  To save over $100 on taxi fare, get the Flyaway Bus outside the airport to Union Station then get the Metro Red route to Vermont / Santa Monica station.  The hotel is 200 yards up the street.  It has the slightest incline but don't worry if your bags have wheels.  The Internet TV is poor but the hotel offers free wireless access.  Great if you brought your laptop but if you didn't - use the Internet Cafe across the street  $3 per hour.  The room was clean, comfortable  and the hotel also has a car hire facility.   Breakfasts were great with a huge array of waffles, toast, cereal, coffee, juice, sausages and scrambled eggs.     The only thing I found a bit of a challenge is that;4
Very beautiful classic 20's hotel. Very impressed by the size of our room which had a living room, bedroom and two full size bathrooms. It was plenty big for a family of 6. We had amazing customer service from everyone that worked at the hotel. I am super picky on cleanliness and our room was super clean. We were walking distance to time square, the Empire State building and Central park. The only downside was the cost of about 350.00 per night and the parking which I was told would be 50.00 per night and it was 70.00.;4
My family just stayed at the Morningside Inn for six days.  It may not be in the middle of  Times Square but is accessible to wherever you might want to go easily by the subway.  The metro system  is a couple of very short blocks from the hotel, and as you walk home there are three grocery stores in addition to a bakery.  The grocery store on the corner was the one we used and had everything you would need  down to a can opener.  The hotel is in a very safe, quiet residential neighborhood.  We never heard any noises inside or outside the hotel during any night of our stay.  There were even signs that if you honk your horn  you can be fined.  Coming from the Sesame Street era, I felt Big Bird was going to step out at any moment as I looked down the street.  In addition, we;4
I was worried also after reading the reviews.  The rooms were small but very comfortable.  They had a nice duvet and comfortable beds.  The breakfast buffet was the same every day but with plenty of variety.  The front desk let us cancel a room we didn't need the day we got there which was against policy!  The only negative I could say was the temperature control in the rooms were not working properly. My room was freezing and my sisters room was very warm.  The comedy show was comedians practicing to be comedians and their comedian friends were there to laugh for them!!!  Kind of funny to see! Also a local Salsa dance club there Fri. night - So it has some entertainment and fun to watch. - free for hotel guests to enter both!  It was definitely a good location by the subway. We;4
My husband and I stayed here in July 02. We stayed here for 4 nights. Our room had a great view of the Universal Theme Park and the highway/homes in the hills views) We liked being right at the entrance to a theme park and Universal City. The room was clean and spacious. The food is great. They have a breakfast buffet and a dinner buffet that are outstanding! They offer a shuttle service for tours in the la area. We would definately return here!;4
Stayed at the Jane for 4 nights in March 2015 and we really loved it. Yes, the rooms are tiny ( if you are very tall/ of a larger frame you may be better upgrading) but the lobby staff were willing to take one of our suitcases into storage and this gave a bit more space. We found our room to be clean and the space is quite clever. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only small issue was that after our return from the theatre we were stopped from entering the hotel by the nightclub bouncers as we did not meet the dress code for the club. This was quickly rectified. We never saw anyone else in the bathroom which was always clean. We would recommend this hotel to some of our friends who we think would like the experience but not to others (My Mum would hate it!!) We are saving now;4
Stayed here for 3 nights, was great location near Times Square/Broadway. Hotel lobby was welcoming and had a quick check in. Room was lovely, very modern with huge walk in shower/no bath. Large flat screen TV, minibar,safe and even an umbrella you can borrow hanging in the wardrobe, nice touch.  The staff  were very helpful and dealt quickly with an issue I had (not with the hotel) and made phone calls to assist with my transfer. Very efficient. Thank you for a great stay, would recommend.;4
Great location. Close to Times Square. Staff definitely went the extra mile. Special mention has to go to Jeff the Doorman for his knowledge and advice on attractions close to the hotel. No request was too small.;4
I shopped around to find the least expensive hotel that wasn't in a bad area and this was it. I had a room with 2 double beds. It was small but it was perfect for just sleeping. It was quiet and the staff was friendly. I would stay there again.;4
Lovely hotel, within walking distance of Universal studios. Spent 4 nights here, as ideal as a base for visiting other areas of LA.  Room was clean, modern and a good size. Food was expensive but good quality. Our room was on the 20th floor with a wonderful view of the theme park. The only down side for us was that we were given a room with an interconnecting door and there was a family in the next room with 3 children and they must have been the noisiest ever, bumping, banging, shouting and screaming, every word said could be heard and being woken up at 06:30 in a morning to all this noise was less than ideal when on holiday. So the reviewer who said that having a room on a high floor was less busy and quieter was wrong. As in this instant as we found that there was a lot of;4
This is a large Art Deco style hotel in a very central location for getting around New York. It is very close to Penn Station which has good transport links. We used this station to get a train directly to Newark Airport, which was much quicker and less expensive than a taxi. The hotel has a spacious and imposing lobby with more than enough lifts to get you to its many floors. This is a busy hotel which is used by groups as well as business people and tourists and there is sometimes a queue at the check in desk. We found the reception staff efficient and helpful and our requests were dealt with promptly. The quality of the bedrooms varies depending on the type of room you book - some have excellent refurbished bathrooms and modern decor and others have rather old fashioned;4
A little pricey but overall was a great stay....awesome buffet selection!!!! Walking distance to city walk and universal studios made it easy to enjoy the facility without the hassle of walking back to a car  and driving...worth the money for sure;4
The New Yorker is a beautiful hotel. All the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The location of this hotel is perfect, within walking distance of Times Square, Empire State Building and many more attractions.  Close to a bus stop and subway stop.;4
Great friendly service, the staff was always pleasant and friendly. A 10 minute walk to Times Square, Empire State, Herald Sq...Rooms were modern and clean. Highly recommend. Only downside was the traffic noise all night long;4
We Stayed 4 nites this hotel.. Location great, less than 10 minutes walk to heart of NYC Fabulous Time Square... Staff was great, door man n front desk were friendly. Room  a bit small, watch out for bed foot not really good, my kids getting hurt of it, iron corner.;4
Stayed here for 2 nights with 10 family members. The hotel was excellent. The only improvement that could be made is to the cost of the food at the in-house restaurants. Otherwise, the entire hotel was beautiful and the pool area was very nice. The hot tub was hot and they serve drinks at a small bar at the pool. There is a walking path to Universal that is very walk-able even with children. (and the shuttle comes every 20 minutes). Our room had a nice view of Universal/the Harry Potter section.;4
Arrived from Australia 4 hours before check-in time and that was no problem! The staff at the front desk were really nice throughout my 4 night stay. I had ants in my room which I discovered at 10:30 at night, the lady at the front desk organized for someone to come sort it out straight away which was good. They also happily changed my notes for coins to use the washing machine and dryer. The bed was super comfy and big! There is not a great deal of things in the area but the bus and red line are close by which you can take to Hollywood, Universal Studios or to the beach. I would definitely stay there again if I was traveling with others but it's probably not the most convenient place when you're getting around on your own.;4
I ended up with mixed feelings after my stay in the Jane, as it was divided in a period of 4 nights and one more night after a visit to Chicago. The first series of nights, I slept on the 6th floor (the top floor), at the end of a hallway, so nice and quiet. The room is terribly small as can be seen on the website. One wall consists entirely of a mirror, with a rod and some hooks above it, so itâs easy to cover up (Iâve passed the point where I want to see myself in the mirror all the time). There are some cupboards under the bed, a plank both at the foot end and above the bed that serve as even more storage space. So once youâre sorted it becomes possible to cope with the tiny space. There is a fan that serves pretty good as an air cooler, a tv with a reasonable amount of;4
We spent 2 weeks at the Empire Hotel last month (June 2014). The hotel is situated very close to the Lincoln Center and to Central Park.For the first night we were in a double standard room with a poor view but we were upgraded the second day without needing to ask to the 8th floor with a great view of the street below. The housekeeping was excellent: sheets were changed every day and towels provided. We also used the hairdryer and the umbrella which were in the room. Before going to New York we read reviews that complained about the lifts, although 1 or 2 of the 4 lifts occasionally were out of order, we were not waiting too long. The staff were very helpful with making reservations for us. The paper above our shower peeled back one day so we went to inform staff, just to let;4
If you are planning to visit Universal Studio Hollywood, there is no better place to stay than the Hilton / Universal City. Located a short walking distance from the theme park, the hotel offers a combination of convenience, quality lodging and friendly services. At first glance, the self-parking at $30 a day may seem high ( valet at $44 a day ) but the multiple entries, ease of getting into the hotel from the parking structure and generous size parking spaces quickly made the daily parking a bargain of sort. The lobby is fairly congested but expected for a theme park hotel. It is par for a upper range facility under the Hilton brand in terms of appearance with generous glass and stones. The elevator issues ( hotel has been systematically shutting down and updating them ) was;4
The hotel is in a Great Location. The Beautiful Lobby features a Great Bar. The atmosphere is relaxing and the bartenders are good-looking and attentive. The spacious room features a Comfortable Bed, but a  Small Bathroom.;4
Minimalist decorating. No dresser to put clothes in. Shower only, no tub. Comfortable beds. Great location. Stayed here arranged by travel agent and with group. Even though it had no tub or dresser it was more than adequate as we spent so little time in the room. Great service by hotel staff.;4
For the money, this is a fantastic hotel. All hotel rooms in NYC are small, this was no different but big enough for our needs.  If going to NYC in summer this hotel is perfect - the Private roof terrace/pool/bar are first class.  Great part of town, not overly noisy, and 2-3 minute walk from Central Park.  The oysters and burgers in the bar on the ground floor are also excellent.  I will definately look up this place again when I return.;4
Perfect location...close enough to everything but still tucked away to avoid the craziness of Times Square.   Lobby Bar perfect for cocktails before heading out and the Rooftop Bar is being renovated, should be open in October.  The room was spacious, was upgraded to a Queen Superior...even though the shower could use an upgrade.  Overall, a pleasant stay and will always be my first choice for short stays in Manhattan...enjoy the ride!;4
I loved the location of this hotel - being on Central Park was a real plus for me. The beds were comfortable, the service was good, and the rooms were clean. We stayed in two different rooms - 2 beds (no view) and then 1 bed (view of the park). Both rooms were fine. They were roomy enough and had decent showers and TV was fine. I was with my son who was moving into Columbia, and this was very convenient. I had a take out dinner from the Deli up the street - they were very nice. I ate in Central Park as it was a gorgeous day. The subway stop is a block away - very convenient. If you want to be in the center of the action, don't stay here. If you want to be in a little quieter part of Manhattan, but near a subway station,  and near Central Park, this place is great.;4
This hotel is so well located. We were so pleased and the weather could not have been better considering it was November. Great staff. Very friendly and helpful. Would definitely refer others and stay again.;4
It was under construction over the holidays, but the location is perfect for the theme park.  They upgraded us to a corner king suite...it was lovely!!  We were able to walk from the hotel, over the main street, on a pedestrian bridge directly to Universal!;4
Stayed here on our 1st visit to New York. We found the location good for us. 10 min walk from Times Sq and Empire State Building. The hotel restaurant Tick Tock was a good place to fuel up to start the day. Good sign that it was used by locals as well as guests. Rooms are of a decent size and reasonable quality. But hey you don't go to New York to stay in your room. We would stay here again.;4
Incredibly busy, centrally located hotel. Great for sightseeing or business base across the road from Penn Station and a stones throw from Empire State  - hence the rating of 4. But - brusque and officious reception staff on check in and out. Be aware of add on costs -  âFreeâ wifi actually part of additional âfacilities feeâ of almost $30 per day... and then also got charged an extra $5 per piece of luggage (cabin baggage and laptop bag) stored with concierge. For the total cost, would expect friendlier service.;4
Just back from 4 days staying at the New Yorker. Had requested an accessible room via travel agent however this information was not passed to the hotel. Explained requirements to reception and the girl changed our room.. And gave us an early check in!! FANTASTIC.  Great room, spotless with loads of room for all the shopping.  Brilliant location - Hotel is across the road from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.. Couple streets from Macy's and Empire State Building..   Would recommend this hotel and definitely stay there next time we are in NYC ð½â¤ï¸;4
We enjoyed our night at the Hilton:  the rooms were clean, pleasant and relatively quiet.  The Friday-night prime rib and seafood buffet was a major disappointment:  huge waste of money on a terrible meal.;4
Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City has the best location near Universal Studios. We loved to stay there every Summer!  We can easily drive to any other destination in LA. This hotel has a wonderful service and offers a delicious breakfast buffet.;4
I stayed here with my 2 kids (age 14 and 11) as part of a new year getaway. We usually go to Anaheim when visiting So Cal and wanted something different. While we were only moderately impressed by Universal Studios (see separate review) we did find this hotel to be a good find. The room was ready when we arrived and had a nice view of Universal Citiwalk. Citiwalk is a fun area with lots of shops and restaurants and we enjoyed it being a short 15 minute walk from the hotel. The shuttle as well was convenient as the nights were quite cold. Good hotel restaurant for breakfast and gelato/Starbucks/snack bar on site also. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. Had some trouble getting pressure in shower correct which was disappointing but overall nice room. Room also has mini;4
Stayed here with family for a 4 night stay  It has all you really need for staying in New York. Itâs not somewhere your going to spend a lot of time in a hotel room. Room was a little small for 3 of us, couldnât wheel the case between the beds, room was clean though & just what we needed.  Ice machine on our floor which was brill The tick tock dinner is brilliant being attached to the hotel - we went every morning.  In a great location.  Not a luxury stay if thatâs what your looking for but we werenât so was good for us.;4
This hotel is in a perfect location to go out and explore. Madison square garden is across the street, Penn station just a few minutes walk away. The empire state building a 10 !minute walk.....I could go on! The rooms are small but clean and the bed was comfy. The staff that we spoke to were very friendly. You can get a nice breakfast in the tick tock but it is a bit pricey when you can walk down the road and get a breakfast that's just as good for less. The 911 memorial museum is a must, you need to que for a ticket to get in before you join another que to go in. If you want to go to the statue of liberty go to battery park for your ticket not the touts that are all around as you may find yourself on a boat that does not actually stop and let you get off, it's just a photo;4
We were in London for a few days and had a hectic schedule, so being so close to Hammersmith station was a definite bonus! Room was clean, with a cupboard and a fridge and plenty of plug points for charging devices.  Customer service was not great over the phone (we called to confirm booking and they weren't very helpful), but when we arrived and spoke to them in person, they were polite and accommodating.  Only quibble is no free wifi - if we hadn't had free data, this would have been very inconvenient.  Would def recommend - some friends stayed here too and they also thought it was good.;4
Everything was great, except for the surprise that you charge $5 a bag to store before check-in. Iâve stayed in many Wyndham hotels, including the New Yorker, & Iâve never had to pay a fee. As a Wyndham Rewards member, I think this service should be included. The location was a 3-minute walk from Penn Station. Many of the theaters were only a 15-20 minute walk.;4
This hotel is near a number of iconic attractions.  In addition to Universal Studios, it is very close to Hollywood and the Walk of Fame.The bellmen, staff at the concierge desk and front desk were always helpful. The pool was attractive and the service there was good.  We stayed in two different rooms and both were well maintained.  The elevators were under construction when we were there but a lot of effort was made to ease the congestion that resulted from that.  The hotel is expensive as is the food service, but a lot of effort is made to give value for the money.  We enjoyed the free apples at the front desk and the water with lemon nearby.;4
Mohammed was too kind to set us up right as soon as we walked in at noon. I will say the room is from an older design so don't expect any closet space or a large bathroom, but we weren't overly concerned about spending a lot of time there. The room was clean, but sink clogged a few times and faucet made a horrible noise when you first turned it on.  Otherwise, valets were wonderful and the $ was right for two nights. So worth the stay to walk to b shows, TS, and excellent eateries. Will stay again for sure.;4
Very friendly front desk staff, Michael G. very responsive to our needs, knowledgeable about the area, assisting us as needed. Rooms efficient,price comparable, clean and neat. Comfortable stay, would return again. Housekeeping staff always cleaned room very well.;4
The reviews about the rooms being small / tight are true.  If you're someone who needs or wants extra space, you will need to upgrade to a bigger room.  The overall decor is urban-modern and well executed.  There are some maintenance issues that could use some attention - for example, the stopper in our bathroom sink wasn't properly connected and there was some peeling paint around the doors.  That said, we weren't there to spend time in the hotel.  We were there to see NYC, and this location can't be beat.  Being so near Columbus Circle puts you near a great subway hub, Central Park, Whole Foods, Lincoln Center, etc - and it feels very SAFE.  So the bottom-line is that if you're looking for a place to land in a great location this is a solid spot at this price.  The rooftop bar;4
I love this hotel where l have stayed for the past nine years! It has its faults and could do with a lot of improvements - l love the location and the staff is lovely most of the time! I would recommend it to friends and actually have done in the past!;4
My family and I decided to spend 5 nights (Sun-Thurs) in LA before our son went back to school. We found the hotel on the web and chose it based on availability,price and location,as we planned two day's at Universal Studio's. We called ahead and asked for a room on a upper floor and facing the court yard. We did get upper floor (2nd),but not facing the courtyard. We had the deluxe room (254). This is the back corner across from the ticket taker before leaving the parking lot.   We paid for our reservation in advance and were told we were going to have to leave a $100 deposit that would be returned when we check out. But when we checked out we were told that it was just a credit hold and nothing was charged. We were charged for parking at $22 a day plus another $2 tax. We;4
We recently stayed here to celebrate a birthday and anniversary. We got an upgrade to a room with a view which was amazing . The hotel was perfect for where and what we needed. The room was great and with a nice bathroom . Staff were friendly and efficient and the complementary champagne was a lovely treat .;4
Stayed here with a friend for 5 nights, the only downside to this hotel I felt was the location. Although near to public transport links the hotel is in a pretty bad part of Hollywood, me and my friend (females in late 20s) did not feel safe walking outside the hotel after dark.  The hotel itself is really nice it has a good pool area which had plenty of available sun loungers which were really comfy. We had a room with 2 queen beds in, the room was really spacious and had a good size bathroom.  There was breakfast included which had a good variety. Eggs, pancakes and waffles were made to order with a good choice of fillings. There was also cereal, pastries, fruit, cold meat available as well.;4
So we went on a 2 night staycation with my 3 youngest boys!  They had their 2 favorite things to do:  EAT and SWIM!   Start with the food.  Large selection including an Asian section.  Food was good.  And plentiful!  I asked our waiter to blend up some watermelon to make watermelon juice and he happily complied. Excellent service from our waiter! The pool was WARM enough for me to go in.  I rarely swim because usually the pool is too cold.  It was about 85 degrees.  ANOTHER great amenity that they have are cabanas which we didn't really need because it wasn't too hot BUT it's nice to have if you had a large group.  AND get this, NO charge!  It's first come first served.  I LOVE that! It's a great spot if you were going to go to Universal Studios.   You will like this property!!;4
We spend 5 days there and had a large suite with a dobbelt bed. The place is a little worn down but we were satisfied with the hotel anyway - since it had a pool and a little gym. Only thing that was a bit anoying was that we had to pay for the parking. We used the parkometers outside the hotel instead and saved a lot of Money...but overall a Nice hotel that we would recommend;4
As soon as we checked in, we were made to feel welcome.  We were given a great room on 17th floor with a fantastic view of the Universal Studios park.  Our room was spacious and bright and the beds very comfortable.  The bathroom, although not the most modern, was perfectly adequate, clean and a good size.  Staff were always efficient and helpful.   The pool was nice for a spot of relaxation although it's not huge (with noisy, clanging gate) and poolside food is very expensive so beware getting over enthusiastic with the menu!   The evening buffet is very over-priced and definitely not worth the money - especially, if you are a family with children eating small - normal sized meals.  Some guests really made sure they got value for money!  The hotel's proximity to Hollywood was;4
This is a small hotel in meat packing district, New York City. I stayed there 2 nights. It was great place to crash. No private bathroom. The room was so tiny and can fit a small single bed with TV and wifi. No window or anything else. The bathrooms are shared but nobody were there. It is nice and clean, great location. The hotel built just like the old old school in England...Dark and historical. My rent was about $100 per night so kinda good price for one person.;4
For a hotel in the middle of New York I was expecting to pay with an arm and leg, but the price was totally fair. We had a two bed room it was super small so don't expect to hang around in your room, but let's be for real if your just chillin in your apartment while visiting NY you should have just stayed home. The only reason that I gave it one less star than perfect is because our room was in the corner my the alley and it smelt like cat pee. So if you go try not to get that room.;4
Room had two beds and was VERY cramped, but that's to be expected in NYC.  Staff was very nice, and everyone I encountered was extremely helpful.  Room cleanliness ( deep cleaning) left a bit to be desired....dusty wallpaper above bed, and grime in corners of bathroom....but honestly overall it wasn't a big deal.  Bed was comfy, nice big flat screen TV, free wi-fi, and walk able to great dining.;4
We visited ny for my daughter 21st birthday present. On arrival we were offered an upgrade which we accepted at an additional 75 dollars per night that included all services . This was not the case when we checked out as the service charge was added at 22 dollars per night plus tax . The hotel beds were small more like a large single the draft from the windows meant we had to sleep with heating on which meant for a stuffy room. Overall this did not hamper out holiday and would stay again;4
Our experience at the New Yorker was ok. The price was good for Manhattan. Great location right next to Penn station. Elevators were a bit slow but not terrible. The pressure of the water at the 20th floor was so strong and the water so hot that after walking all day it was wonderful to be able to take a bath.;4
Great location. Steps from the Lincoln Centre. Close to Central Park  & Met Museum. Easy subway access to all major attractions. Hotel room style was chic compact modern to match the design decor of the building interior and very quiet. Quality buffet breakfast available. Friendly and knowledgeable staff.;4
"Went to go to store on Thursday evening around 11, on the way back all entrances to hotel were literally log jammed. The road into the airport backed up and created a very slow moving traffic jam. I only made it back in decent time by doing very creative driving, which most people would not be able to manage...for example, going in opposite lane to clear an intersection, etc. several times. It was terrible and made me think twice about leaving again if taking out the car.  The next night was okay, but I had had enough. I normally stay in the Valley where I can pull up in front of the hotel, and don't even need to pay for a lot.  Uber will not save you from a traffic jam; the night i refer to, people were exiting about  a mile from the airport and walking to the terminals, based";4
Well located in Hollywood. An area that is safe to walk around and some reasonable local restaurants. Amenities - good breakfast, nice swimming pool, small shop and guests' laundry. Helpful staff. Tea and coffee provided in the rooms.;4
Originally built in 1929 and retaining many original features from that period the hotel is well managed and comfortable. The front of house amenities and staff are all very good, particularly good service from all the staff who are friendly and helpfull. The lower level and restrooms contain a small and informative museum telling the story of The New Yorker from first being built to the present day. This area has period recordings in the background from programmes that were broadcast from the hotel during the 30's and 40's, it's a pity that these recordings aren't played in the lobby area  as this is more in keeping with the overall ambiance of the Art Deco lobby than the classical music selection which is currently played. The attached Tik Tok 24 hour diner serves a good;4
The hotel is very nice and clean.  The beds are probably in the top 5 most comfortable bed I've ever slept in outside of home.  The only reason I didnt give it a 5 is the staff upon arrival was not Texas courteous when they had us stash our luggage in a room.. Rushed, snappy, added an element of uncomfortable.  Otherwise, the hotel is centrally located, nice, easy and I would recommend it.;4
We stayed here just for a change of pace while visiting our son who lives in NYC. We got a deal thru a 3rd party site & decided to explore the area. Macy's & many other stores easily walkable. The bar was OK, drinks were priced for midtown, but not up to standards. Tick-Tock diner was awesome! Pricey of course but the Nutella french toast was worth it. Staff were very friendly, elevators plenty & fast (yes this is a consideration if you've stayed in other places in Manhattan!) Wife & I are Big Band aficionados, so when we discovered the historic exhibits downstairs we were in heaven. We even snooped around to the ballrooms, 2nd floor mezzanine, etc. Some things have obviously changed since the hotels heyday, but it was neat to spot some of the old fixtures, hardware, etc. If;4
We stayed here as a pre Christmas treat, it was well situated for the theatres, south bank centre, London eye and lots of the museums. They were having issues at check in and our room wasnât ready even though it was after 4.30pm, but the staff worked hard to resolve this and gave us complimentary breakfast for our stay. The cleaning staff seemed desperate for us to be out of the room on the day we left well before check out time, but the reception staff were very apologetic and offered to escalate our complaint, but we didnât pursue it as weâd been very happy with our stay. Every where was very clean and well lit, the restaurant staff were amazing with my allergy and although the room was basic it was clean, in good repair and very quiet. Weâll stay here again.;4
Good hotel in a central position but definitely needs an upgrade !  We were moved 3 times for various reasons and the rooms were pretty much the same in decor and condition.   Staff were mostly helpful and friendly. Hardly a 4 star hotel but this is New York!;4
This hotel was close to all the sights we wanted to see. 5 minute walk from Central Park and other attractions. Nice and friendly. View from the room was great. Room served its short stay purpose. A little let down by the shower door missing and shower in general had seen better days. Sleep disturbed as the water pipes seemed to run through the room and if a tap or shower was on in a neighbouring room we knew about it. Lifts broken for 2 days causing long delays. The room is a good size and would have been execellent only for the bathroom.;4
After reading reviews on this hotel, I wasn't sure what to expect. I chose this hotel because it was close to my brother's place and the Metro subway station.  I had a non-smoking room facing the patio garden with 2 queen sized beds.  The room was clean and large enough for our needs. It had a coffee maker, fridge and microwave which was very convenient. It had a flat screen t.v and free internet. Staff were friendly and check out was quick and effecient. Reviews were accurate about the elevators-they are slow and you can't use the stairs, but I knew this ahead of time so it was not a big deal. The breakfast buffet was the same everyday but my 2 children did not mind. It consisted of homemade waffles, bacon, eggs, juice, toast, bagels, 3 kinds of cereal. I would have liked cream;4
"We stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights. Our room was a bit small (310) and the bed was very soft and small. There is a lot of noice coming from the street at night; but you're in the centre of NYC! We thank Julian for his advice and help when we needed it; love this guy! Also the rest of the staff is very friendly and helpfull.";4
Well my stay at abercorn house was eventful if anything , on trying to get to sleep i discovered my room mate ( a six foot snoring twot ) could not be awakened . well after two hours of hurling objects of different size and weight at his offensive smelling prone body , i did what any drunk man would do , put in my headphones and listened to AC DC how quickly i nodded off to be awakened to the large chap next to me asking how could i sleep through that , my retort was colourful to say the least , so  ð©ð©ð© on the fulham we were robbed ,COME ON BORO;4
"This hotel is located right across from Madison Square Garden. Excellent locale.  Huge, historic, iconic building! That said, itâs costly ($262/night equates to $873 for 2 nights, then hotel charged an âamenityâ fee of $45/night on top of the $873 upon check in) there are no amenities outside of a gym. Coffee pot in room=$$surcharge mini-frig=$$surcharge... so a metro room comes with NOTHING! Also: no room service. Small rooms. Metro room too small for 2 people. No fan in bathroom. Dated decor. Bathroom needed major upgrade and was a sardine can size. I was on 37th floor in room 3724; Views were stellar. Location is stellar. Comfort is mediocre.  Front desk staff was kind, but only 1-2 people ever there for so many rooms=long waits... that all being said: I would stay again for";4
I visited this hotel when I was in New York and stayed here for the duration of my stay. It was a wonderful hotel with amazing service, very clean and provided complimentary tea and coffee every morning. Amazing location, only a couple minute walk from times square with a starbucks right across. Would definitely revisit!;4
After a long trip into the city the hotel was a cheerful site even with the scaffolding. Mohammed was great and gave us an upgrade after we explained what went wrong. Our room was spacious, the staff polite at all times. The hotel may need upgrading a little but we thought it added to the charm. We ate at the Diner next door and had no complaints. Great location as within walking to distance to all everything or alternatively hop on the tube. Would definitely stay there again;4
I took my sister to New York City for her 40th Birthday (a surprise trip) along with three of my cousins.  We stayed in the New Yorker Hotel for three nights.  This hotel is in an excellent location and it was one of a small few hotels that can accommodate five people to sleep in one room.  The hotel decor is a bit dated but aside from that the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. For the amount of time that we spent in our hotel it was overall a pleasant stay.  I would definitely stay here again for location and value for money.  The hotel is located right at Penn Station, Macy's Store, is very close to Empire State and is a 10 minute walk to Times Square.;4
Stayed here for four nights, location is great, 2 minutes walk from Penn station which makes getting to JFK airport a breeze. 10-15 minutes walk to Times Square and The Empire State building. Rooms are well cleaned and beds are comfy. Tick Tick diner is well worth a visit.;4
there is a charge for early check in, when checked out charge for holding your suitcases prior to leaving the hotel. no tea and coffee facilities, cheaper to buy a kettle and some cups, ( which we did ) , booked a standard room with queen bed, assuming my friend and I had a bed each, no we had to share a bed, could have been a problem, could have up graded but should have been told of this before hand. Resort fee gives you free usage of the telephone, very worthwhile, can make international calls etc also use of wi fi and computer room. Lovely art deco hotel though, clean and plenty of hot water, staff very helpful. John Concierge very helpful, also Naomi our cleaner nothing too much trouble for either of them. Tick Tock diner adjoined found this expensive, around the corner;4
I stayed at the hotel with my group for 5 nights. The room was comparatively small, but the house keeping was perfect. Although there was no microwave and no fridge in the room I did not miss either as much because we planned to eat out, but then there are microwave and fridge in the kitchen in the lower lobby. Eva is a complement to the hotel, she was there to make our stay very comfortable.;4
This was the second time in the Jane. Unfortenately they don't open the space behind the bar so only the bar was open. Thet where superfriendly to change our booking because we misplanned our flight. The room is very cosy but relatively small. The bathroom is spacious and very nice. The employees are not extremely friendly but also not unfriendly. The cooling and heating in the room didn't function or we didn't understand. I like to hotel because it is a hotel and hostel mixed but I found the price os USD 315 including taxes for one night to expensive compared to for example the Standard which charged USD 500.;4
The best thing about the Hollywood Hotel is itâs located so that it is possible to reach what you want to see in LA. We took the metro to the walk of fame, Universal and the beaches. It was easy from the hotel.  The rooms are clean and okay, but needs an update. The pool area is nice and not to crowded. The courtyard is very cozy.  The breakfast is served is the basement and the variety is good and cooks prepares omelets and waffles.;4
Impressed with the room...small but clean. The staff were very helpful from the get-go. Centrally located...near Penn Station, walkable to all the places we wanted to go. Would definitely return to this hotel. It was very reasonably price for NYC.;4
"I am a travel agent and stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on vacation in December.   Check-in was fast and easy, we got there a bit before check-in time and they had a room available so they let us check in early. The lobby is so quirky and interesting.   We went up the elevator to our room, it was functional. For the price we weren't expecting much, but the bedspreads were clean, there was a safe in the closet, and seemed to be decorated to the similar ""old ship cabin"" style of the rest of the hotel.   The shared bathrooms down the hall were really great- for a shared bathroom. We quite often saw staff come in to mop or wipe down the counter tops. They were always very clean. The two shower stalls and two toilet stalls both had large wooden doors (no gaps at bottom or top) that";4
Great hotel within easy reach of all the main sites. Very helpful reception and assisted with special requests in the initial booking. Not a fantastic view from the room but we had 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms and as there is so much to see in New York we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway. Would recommend this hotel.;4
Stayed her for four nights 11-15 April.   The hotel was perfect for what we wanted.  Location is fantastic, only minutes away from Times Square, Macy's etc.  Over the road from Penn Station.  It was my friends 50th birthday celebrations, and we notified the hotel prior to travelling, and we were all upgraded to larger metro rooms free of charge, with fantastic views of the Empire State Building.  The hotel was extremely busy, and often had long queues at reception to check in and check out, but was never waiting too long.  There were also queues for the lifts at peak times, but again never had to wait more than a few minutes.  The rooms were quite small, but only what you would expect from a city hotel.  They were also extremely clean and the maids came every day and made the;4
Be sure to book your stay directly through the hotel. I booked with Universal Studios, was promised a room with a wonderful view. Instead, I got a room on the first floor, which is two floors below the lobby with a partial view of the pool and a concrete wall. There wasn't even an ice machine on that floor. However, Pamela, a front-desk supervisor, made it right after I brought the problem to her attention. Our room was clean, every staff member we met was friendly, and Universal Studios was within walking distance. There is a shuttle that runs to Universal Studios. It drops you off in the middle of the Universal Walk. The only drawback was the food situation. Prices are high ($22 per person for breakfast, $30 per person for breakfast buffet). There are no vegetarian options for;4
Traveling from Michigan to see our daughter between semesters and had the best experience...Excellent service from the moment we arrived. Pil and Nicole went out of their way to help us with all our needs. Will return.;4
-The room we stayed in was nice , clean, and newly updated -Staff were friendly and available, and helpful in answering questions  -Continental breakfast was delicious.  -the hallways were still being updated so the common areas weren't as nice.  - would stay here again;4
Beautiful hotel, great location. Rooms are a little dated and compact but had a powerful shower and comfortable bed which was all i needed. Staff were friendly and helpful. Tick Tock diner and butcher &banker restaurant on site would definitely stay there again.;4
Stayed here about 15 years ago with our daughter and came back because we liked it before.  It is still a great hotel in an excellent location.  Free shuttle service to Universal City Walk, but you can also easily walk there.  Tons of food, shopping and entertainment options at City Walk without any admission charge.  Entrance to Universal City is easily accesable.  Hotel is beautiful with lots of glass and well landscaped grounds.  Be prepared to pay top dollar for services within the hotel itself.  Had martini's at the hotel bar during happy hour that were $12 each, but the free hors de vors  were outstanding!  Went back down to the bar for 2 vodka tonics to take back to our room and the bill was $43 (to clarify-they were doubles and that included the tip, but still--a bit of;4
Pros were that the room was of a decent size and was clean. The front desk staff was helpful when we asked questions. It's in a very central location so it's easy to get to Griffin Park, Hollywood, downtown, etc. very easily. From the outside it doesn't look like it would be all that great, but on the inside it really was. It was reasonably quiet as well (both guests and for being in the city). They have a complimentary breakfast that has all of your continental breakfast options as well as an omelet and waffle station. The air conditioner wasn't a loud, clunker like in usual hotel rooms and kept the room very cold (it was abnormally hot in L.A. while we were there). The beds were very comfortable. Overall, it was a really great experience and I don't really have too many;4
I fully admit that I'm a snobby guest when it comes to hotels. I love staying at the Westins, but will settle for La Quinta's or Courtyards if I feel comfortable in the city. When my family decided to go to NYC over New Years, I knew these types of hotels would be out of my budget. My husband and I booked the Days Hotel through Priceline after deciding to was the closest to our destinations and was reasonably priced for NYC at this time. We stayed for a week, and although I was scared walking into the place, I was pleasently surprised at the outcome.   The hallways were very cluttered with old furniture, and you could tell this was a very old hotel. They were doing a lot of renovation during the five days were there. At first I wondered if this place always looked like this, but;4
Stayed for the 3rd time this year. The hotel has no pretentions to be a grand hotel but for location,room quality and price is unbeatable in central manhatton.The adjacent ticktock diner provides in my opinion the best value breakfast in manhatton;4
The Empire Hotel was wonderful. Even though the room was small, it was well laid out and very comfortable.  The lobby was very cool and as guests, we got priority entrance to the rooftop lounge. The location is ideal and we will stay there again next time we go to New York.;4
Older but well-preserved hotel very close to LAX and with good shuttle service.  Fast wifi, friendly staff, large comfortable rooms.  Nice pool with lots of sun.  Breakfast in the Regency Club was a bit disappointing.  Nothing cooked to order, limited choices, not even regular coffee (watered down espresso is not an adequate substitute).;4
We used this hotel for a rest day inbetween flights on our honeymoon. The hotel is located a short drive from the airport. The check in was quick our room was spacious with 2 queen beds, the room was modern and had coffee making facilities etc, the bathroom was however small and the towels looked worn and there was an uneven amount of towels, perhaps a housekeeping mistake. I didnt know how to switch on the shower and maintenance responded quickly and came to help. Room service was very good and the food was delicious. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.;4
I really like staying here when in Manhattan. The rooms are not plush, but the prices are good. Breakfast is very reasonable. Ed's Chowder House is very nice and PJ Clarke's is in the same building. Cross Broadway and go north on Columbus for more cafes than you could ever visit. Cross the other way for Lincoln Center. The bar on the roof offers wonderful ambiance and views. Staff is professional and just right, not obsequious. Pasquale does good work and so does the concierge. No coffee in the room, but Starbucks is also in the same building. It's easy to stay here, and, for NYC, the price is quite fair.;4
Our son recently moved near this area and we stayed at the Hilton on our visit last week.  The location, service, and room size were perfect.  The breakfast buffet was extremely fresh and extensive. You can walk to Universal Studios, and the views are great from the rooms.  This will be our place to stay on future visits.;4
The front desk staff is great, especially Stewart.  The subway is close, and Hollywood is the first stop going toward Union Station, so that's easy.  There's a less expensive sushi restaurant just a block or two down Vine, from the expensive one at Hollywood and Vine ... (the second subway stop). The buffet at the hotel is YUMMY!  It's great to be able to walk to Universal.;4
A nice hotel, great location within walking distance of everything you need to see in New York and amazing diner adjoined on the ground floor. Under going a refurb at the moment but not a huge impact. Basic room is quite small but as long as youâre here to sleep and not ball room dance itâs fine :);4
The people who worked there were helpful, the place was nice just didn't like that I saw a couple I guess prostitutes but other than that I enjoyed it and I'll probably be back oh ya the rates were reasonable;4
This is a small hotel across the road from Central Park some of the rooms have no view as they look onto other buildings they rooms were warm and clean and the staff were friendly and helpful it's a short walk to the subway station which is a great way of getting around and to sight see in this wonderful city all said its a basic hotel good value and a good base to see New York;4
We stayed at this hotel for five nights and left it yesterday 16th May. The room was on the 9th floor with amazing views of the park and area, the carpet had seen better days but the room was clean and spacious (901) with basic furnishings, it had a balcony and bathroom and the bathroom was spotless, the room was serviced daily and the staff were so friendly it made our stay so much more enjoyable, special mention to Ari on reception - many thanks. The one downside for us was the lack of tea/coffee facilities in the room, a small touch but one that would be well appreciated by guests.  In the area - Crepes on Columbus, a nice place to eat breakfast or Dinner - Oconnells bar, Broadway and 103? - for the best pint of Guinness in NY, see seperate reviews;4
This was my first trip to NYC. I was referred to this hotel by a friend. The staff was very helpful. Location was great, right next to MSG and Penn Station. It's an older hotel that has been remodeled nicely. Good beds. Bathroom was a little small but was nice. View of the city was awesome. I would stay here again because of the proximity. Also, the Tick Toc cafe on site was excellent for breakfast.;4
we stayed here 5th-10th may, found it clean, powerful shower, fresh towels daily, very helpful staff.  nothing fancy, but basic and just what you need in nyc.  sure ya dont visit there to sit in a hotel room?   subway station 2 blocks away, very accessible, acing central park, and very quiet.  highly recommend it!;4
Let's face it, you get what you pay for.  Yes, the rooms are small in some hotels (this one included) but hey, what's important?  A big room?  An in-room coffee maker?  There is a diner right in the hotel for your coffee fix and there are two, not one, Dunkin Donuts coffee shops a block away.  Beds were comfortable, pillows ample and a clean bathroom.  What more does one need?  This hotel is a short distance away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and the room prices reflect that.  The staff at check-in were friendly and engaging.  I'd would stay here again.;4
Had a few nights in NY with family  This hotel was a great location for us Close to park, 10 minutes walk to time square Central for the Top view bus connection. Hotel foyer and lobby really groovy and great ambiance  Rooms an little tired but ok.  Also has a cool roof top bar;4
Good hotel. Convenient to have fridge and microwave in the room. Nice breakfast. I'm allergic to gluten but that wasn't any issue. Sonia and Hugo helped me daily with gluten-free waffles or pancakes and they even served me with it so I didn't need to queue.;4
We stayed for 10 nights. It was our first trip to NYC. We stayed in a superior king room ( room 243) and I was surprised at how big it was ( I was expecting a very small room) we had a great view of the Lincoln Center. Bathroom was small but livable. Not much hanging space. But it was a great size for just two people. We were supposed to get free water every day. We only got that the first day. After that, zip! I did take it up with  reception but nothing was done so we ended up buying our own water  When checking out the man at reception was VERY rude ( I canât remember his name) and then tried telling us we owed and extra $240 fin fees! After arguing with him for about 10 mins saying we had actually paid in full a few months earlier, he got in contact with reservations and;4
Nice and clean. My furniture was not in the best condition which was disappointing. The food at the restaurant was amazing! I've eaten there a few times and it never disappointed me. Staff is friendly and helpful.;4
We stayed here for 2 nights on arriving in LA. Prior to arrival we had an issue that needed resolving with a car rental and we had documents faxed to the hotel. The hotel had these waiting on arival and had also tried to fax these on for us. The hotel is located on a junction of a main road, our room was on the less busy street however was a bit noisier than I would have liked. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean and the free breakfast buffet was good with a decent selection and the omelette/waffles made to order. There is a metro station within a few minutes walk which will take you downtown or to Hollywood. I would stay here again if I went back to LA;4
We stayed here for three nights to visit LA. There was construction going on so the place wasnât as pictured understandably but the room was still lovely. The restaurant was closed so we could not get food in the hotel unfortunately and so there was no breakfast thatâs advertised, but there are food places within walking distance that are fab. The staff were very friendly and helpful even though they were under some pressure with a technical issue with room keys not working. there is also a metro station at the top of the road that takes u straight to universal studios and the wall of fame etc which was great.;4
Nice hotel, close to public transport.  No issues with anything, room clean and staff helpful.  Would suggest a car would be handy for touring around after dark not sure I would walk around this neighborhood after dark. There is a car parking charge but there is a tax or charge for everything California.;4
Booked in yesterday for a 5 day break to New York. Amazing customer service from Linda on the reception desk (Monday 12.02.19), she was so welcoming and allowed us to see a variety of rooms before deciding which one we'd chose. We opted for room 384 which is a corner room with amazing views. One size to the Empire State and from the other side Madison Square Garden. Great lobby - art deco and really cool. Looking forward to five days of sight seeing and enjoy the New York hospitality. Started off great with exceptional customer care from Linda.;4
Great place to stay if going to Universal Studios. Hotel staff was great, rooms were clean and well appointed. Prices in the restaurant were extremely high compared to other restaurants in the immediate area.;4
I really liked this hotel, some bits of it could have benefited from a little modernisation, but it was clean and let's face it, when you're in New York the hotel is just somewhere to sleep.   The staff were really friendly, and the concierge was amazing, she founds us some reasonable tickets to Phantom of the Opera.    The only two grumbled I had, was the shower had a mind of its own, one minute freezing, the next scolding hot.  Which made for an interesting, and entertaining for my traveling companion shower.   The second is the additional $25 per day resort fee.  This did not feel good value for money, and just bumped the price up.  My own fault for not reading the small print I guess  That said, I still really enjoyed my stay, and it was really handy location wise so going;4
I am sorry to see reviews that this hotel is somewhat run down because I was there a few years ago to go to the Met and I loved the hotel.  We had the greatest room and it had a view of a mini Statue of Liberty on a roof nearby which was very humorous. Room was elegant, bathroom nice, lobby fine.  Location wonderful.;4
Well, my title kind of says it all.  The location could not be better, just a few blocks from Central Park, around the corner from MoMA, and close to 57th St subway.  I would have given 5 stars, but our room had a noise n the ceiling that didnât get fixed, and kept us up all night, both nights.  Iâm sure it was just that room, and will definitely not hesitate to stay at this property again.;4
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel with a friend that was running a half marathon starting in Central Park. The Empire Hotel is in a great location for that purpose! Just a quick walk to where the race started. It's also right next to Lincoln Center, the subway and near several really great restaurants. The staff at the hotel were really professional and helpful. Our one and only complaint is the bizarre shower and lack of shower door. Imagine taking a shower without a door. Crazy right? We figured there was something wrong with our room and that it  was just ""missing"" half the door. Imagine my surprise when we went to report the maintenance issue only to learn that this is ""normal"". What? Picture water streaming off the shower head and onto the floor. Got the vision? Well according";4
For the hotel class and price, this hotel is not bad at all. The bed is big and very comfy and room size bigger than expected. Bathroom was big but basic, the power of the shower was very good.  Location was very good at the Lincoln Center, near the famous Julliard School and Columbus Circle, not far from Times Square and Central Park, without the traffic and noise you find along Times Square.  Staff were friendly and helpful, they will make you feel comfortable staying there.  Yes it probably could do with new carpet, but it was clean.  Negatiives: 1: Free WiFi only in the lobby, however we managed to connect to Lincoln Center WiFi (free) from our room. 2. No complimentary tea bags or bottled water - you have to pay for everything and they are quite expensive (a convenient;4
place very accomodating and good staff.. very friendly and approachable... but there is that one staff that goes out of his way to cater to you.. his name is PIL.. hes a cool guy.. would come back again..;4
This hotel is excellent value and has great character. Our Captain's cabin was comfortable although we had to get the heat turned off as the room was like an oven the first night. The staff were helpful and friendly. The cafe serves nice food and the bar is very popular with locals and had long queues to get in late at night. Expensive drink but a great  atmosphere in the huge ballroom. We took bikes all the way to Central Park and down to Battry Park no the bike tracks .;4
When you say Hilton you expect amazing. Well this one inst that amazing. The suite is a little run down and the rooms are small. It can definitely do with a refurb inside, its outdated. Staff are all very lovely. Checking was great. Breakfast amazing! We got complimentary breakfast for being HH Members and free parking too and WIFI. We ate dinner on the night they had the buffet. We worth it so be sure to do that. It is very close to universal studios, hollywood. Location is great and its quite. However if universal has an event on and as we were there around Halloween, at night it traffic build up was out of control. So research special events.;4
"The Empire Hotel is pretty much exactly as depicted in its photos. It has a very moody adult-type vibe. The front desk staff was very welcoming, accommodating, and even upgraded our booking from a Deluxe King to a Jr. Suite. Room was good size w/ high ceilings. Stayed on 6th flr with windows on street side and we were not bothered by street noise. I would have rated 5 stars except for 1) the bathroom had some flaws--not as pristine as I like a bathroom to be--it really needed a GOOD scrubbing and there is a fixed glass panel on the tub which forces you to reach awkwardly around it to get to the shower fixture; 2) there was a wad of gum stuck to the light fixture by room door that I had to look at every time we came and went. Ugh! All in all, not sure I'd stay there again unless";4
"We stay here every time we visit NYC which is at least twice a year and we continue to think the Empire provides a fantastic location, great staff, and interesting decor.  Yes, the rooms may seem small (if you are accustomed to the usual cookie-cutter hotel chains), the showers only have ""half-a-door"" with the grout beginning to show some age, and the roof-top pool is more like a long lap-pool, but, who goes to NYC to spend time in a pool?  You are walking distance to a lot of NYC activities & sights such as Central Park, Columbus Circle, Fifth Avenue, Times Square, great restaurants, and of course, Lincoln Center.  For more distance, taxis, buses and the subway are outside the door.  The lobby staff is efficient and helpful and the housekeeping is exceptional.  Two negatives:";4
Stayed here for 3 nights with 2 friends.  We got a taxi from JFK prices at $63.  Check in was easy and we were given our key card for room 3222.  On 32nd floor.   The view was amazing of the Empire State.  We had 2 double beds for 3 adults, room was clean and tidy.  Great location.  2 minute walk from Penn station? McDonaldâs across the road.  Tick tock diner is 24-7 and attached to the hotels.  City tax was payable on check out.;4
I had the opportunity to stay at the Empire in early August ... my son's band was going to play at Lincoln Center. The experience started when I made my reservation and was able to list any requests I might have during my stay ... just one ... a room with a view of the street! I like city noise. On arrival I had exactly what I requested ... a good start. And the stay continued to be positive. The staff is excellent, the room was clean and comfortable, the Lobby Lounge is welcoming and there is a Roof Top Lounge, a wonderful restaurant, a pool (seasonal) and a fitness facility. Walk out the door and you have Lincoln Center and several great restaurants plus you are close to Central Park, 5th Ave. etc. There are cabs just outside the door or the subway is a block or so away.;4
Hotel is great and by far the most convenient to universal studios Hollywood. Got upgraded to the diplomat suite on arrival, but even before then, the staff was nothing short of excellent. They messaged me before I arrived to confirm my arrival time, which I appreciated since my flight was delayed and I did not want my room to be given up (hotel was sold out).  Check in staff was great, my compliments to Mayra and Chiranjeev! No complaints, and only wish more staff were like them.  Room was great? Very large, lots of windows, which let in a lot of natural light. Pictures speak better than my words, so recommend you look at them. Two bathrooms with two showers is always a plus.  My only lack of star is for two reasons, that I wish this hotel provided an executive lounge (know not;4
This hotel was better than I expected and the breakfast was awesome. Hugo is very pleasant and takes care of the customers by making you a custom omelet. He's the man! Hugo rules! The room was clean and maid service was awesome. My microwave didn't work and they put a brand new one in my room within minutes. Good staff.;4
I was in the city to participate in the New York City Marathon.  I chose this hotel based on its location, price and the fact that it offered private, rather than shared, bathrooms that seem to be common in hotels in this price range.  I booked this hotel months in advance, as hotels on marathon weekend book up early and at some pretty outrageous prices!  I held my breath and hoped that I wouldn't be arriving to find a dump.    I was pleasantly surprised to find that this hotel was located across the street from the 96th St. subway station, as I was traveling with several bags and the thought of hiking down busy streets in cold weather for blocks on end did not appeal.  (I later discovered a 2nd subway entrance just outside the hotel's entrance.)  I had flown into JFK and taken;4
Rooms are small but the location is wonderful.Good service, great breakfast with a wonderful view.The best is the location you could go anyplace in the city.We had been several times, but this time the view from our room was terrible and the room smaller.;4
The hotel was very beautiful and I enjoyed the boutique feel of the establishment. My couple complaints were the bathroom was very small and the elevators took quite a bit of time to arrive. Also, I was surprised that there was no sort of taxi service right outside the hotel. Overall it was a great stay for the price we paid.;4
Overall clean hotel, quite lobby area, great decor. Great customer service. Rooftop breakfast was good, but overpriced!  Temperature in the room was my only concern--the air conditioning did not seem to be working.;4
This review is being written now whilst I sit in the lobby/reception area.  Lovely welcome from the door, reception and maid staff.   My daughter and I asked various questions about the best places to eat to what is the best subway to get to our destinations. Ready to answer our questions and share their knowledge of the area.   More hotel pics to follow;4
Stayed for 2 nights in July, chose this hotel primarily for its location to Universal Studios.  On arrival, swiftly checked in by friendly staff, given a room with a fantastic view of universal, our room was 2 double beds, spotlessly clean. Rooms are large with plenty of storage space, beds were comfortable, decor of the hotel is probably getting a bit dated but isn't a problem. Daily housekeeping was good, cleaned and restocked the room well. A/C worked well and wasn't too noisy. Also there is a fridge in the room which came in handy.  Breakfast buffet was good with more things to choose from than you could possibly eat!!  There is a shuttle to universal studios every 15 minutes or so but it only takes 10 minutes (if that) to walk, so not really sure why you would wait.  Only;4
The first thing I would like to say is that we went in January when it was snowy and very cold..The Astor on the Park was so toasty. It was lovely and warm. The rooms are quite small but clean enough. What more do you need than somewhere just to put your head down...you're in the big city...get out there and see it! The AOTP is close to a subway station so you will never be without transport. We walked the full length of Central park one morning...it was lovely. Snow covered gardens. Dont be put off by the location way up in manhatten...as I said the subway was 2 mins walk away. We would definately stay here if we went NY again. There are plenty of deli's just round the corner too. Gorgeous bagels;4
"The New Yorker is the perfectly placed hotel for anyone wanting the full Midtown Manhattan experience. Right outside of Madison Sq Garden arena, with some fab breakfast places just a short walk away, it's a great, central base.  The lobby is very impressive, and looks grand and very art deco.   We stayed on the 29th floor, and although the corridors were a bit shabby and worn, the room itself was lovely, if a bit smaller than expected. The bathroom couldn't fit more than one person in, and there was very little space around the bed, but for two people it was comfortable enough. The bed was very comfy, and the tv worked well for late night ""help you fall asleep"" functions. The room was kept clean and the staff were all friendly enough, too. We didn't eat at the New Yorker and I'd";4
Recently visited New York for the first time and chose the Empire Hotel because of the pool deck and bar thinking it would be a good place to relax after a hectic day sight seeing. On arrival 5th September I was disappointed to hear the pool deck wouldn't be open til Friday which was our last full day! However the location of the Empire , right opposite the Lincoln Center which is stunning , and which we had a view over from our room , more than made up for the disappointment. It was near the amazing Central Park and in a very nice area. It wasn't perfect but the room was cool and clean , lovely shower , nice big comfortable bed. The staff were friendly and helpful , didn't bother with wi-if in the room or the mini bar or snacks. Took our own travel kettle and stocked up from;4
The hotel's location is fantastic. Just a couple of blocks away from the subway, North Central Park and a supermarket. Safe, clean and quiet. The staff is very helpful. It only loses points because of the bathroom. It was a bit cold compared to the rest of the room. Other than that, great place. I'd stay there again.;4
My boyfriend and I stayed for 7 nights at the Days Inn during late September 2014. I am unsure of they have non-smoking/smoking floors/rooms, however at night we noticed we could smell people smoking in near by rooms. This wasn't necessarily an issue for us but should be consisted when booking a room for people who are asthmatic.   Another issue we encountered was the elevators. There are four elevators I believe, 2 of which were broken the whole time and the second set was extremely slow and when it did arrive usually had a heaps of people in it which meant you had to wait for the next one. So we climbed 7 flights of stairs at least twice daily.   However, despite these issues the Days Inn is located in the most beautiful area! There is a cafe literally across the road, a;4
Stayed with two adults and two teenagers for a couple of days. Room was quite small and required some improvisation to manage the lugage and 4 people. Bathroom was updated and clean. As mentioned by others already, the doormen are very friendly and helpful. So before checking in you already start with a positive feeling. Location is ideal as Times Square, 5th Ave or Central Park are in walking distance. We were not impressed by the breakfast offering, however there is a good pret a manger just across the street. For Diner you might even consider Whole Foods just a couple blocks away.;4
This hotel is exceptionally well located and i will probably return for this reason. The rooms are nice but could be cleanier. Mine, though a non smoking room, smelled cigarettes. Not so much, but since i am very susceptible i could see someone had smoked in there sometime.;4
Stayed for two nights on a brief trip to NY. The location is great, right by Penn Station and loads of shops nearby. We arrived much earlier than expected and were pre checked in and were able to leave our bags whilst we went sight seeing.  The room was good, although pretty cold and the heating a little noisy but worked to heat the room enough. If youâre a light sleeper I would bring ear plugs. Stayed on the 36th floor and the views were great. They have security in the lobby to stop non guests using the facilities which is reassuring. Friendly staff and ideal location.  We ate in the tick Tock diner for breakfast on the last morning, which was excellent;4
My husband and I were attending the taping of both Jay Leno and Lopez Tonight and couldn't have been more pleased with the choice that we made.  From the moment we walked into the lobby, someone was there to direct us to the front desk. The gentlemen at the front desk was very gracious and walked us to the elevator leaving us feeling completely welcomed.  Our room was an alcove room with a bank of large windows that gave us a beautiful view of the Hollywood Hills and Universal Studios. At night, the view was even more amazing!  The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable with a small couch, a desk, armoire and king size bed.  The bathroom was also very large and had a vanity area set apart from the sink which I loved. It was a great spot to get your make up done. The best;4
Stayed one night with friends to celebrate our 40th anniversary as nurses. Abercorn House was our original nurses home when we started training at the nearby Charing Cross Hospital. Booked a twin room but got a room with 2 sets of bunk beds. Room clean and fairly quiet except my bed which creaked every time I moved. Room had a fridge but that was the extent of the facilities. Could do with a mirror in the room. Toilets and showers clean. There is a small cafe downstairs selling provisions at reasonable prices.  Overall, for the price, Abercorn House is great value for money in central London.;4
The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the room was clean and spacious. The free shuttle was nice and the driver gave us some helpful information regarding our visit to Universal the next day. With that said, I was disappointed by the fact that the breakfast is not included in the above average hotel cost, and at a starting price of $15 per person (plus an expected tip), we did not partake. The cost of parking, $28, is extremely exorbitant too, and should be included in the overall cost of the stay at the hotel. Also, I was told by the staff member at the front desk that a copy of my receipt would be sent to me via e-mail, he even confirmed the e-mail address. However, I have yet to receive a copy. Because of the high cost of everything, I would probably choose another;4
We had a big room (1109) and a very small bathroom . The room was clean good beds a bit noisy (club and airco) Very good location. Friendly staff and doorman The bar and lobby are ok also the wifi only  in the lobby Thanks.;4
"Hotel has a fabulous location - easy walk to Universal theme park and CityWalk. Also close to Metro; we ran out of time, but would have been interested in taking that one stop to Hollywood. Pool was nice and not crowded. We did not use restaurants or room service so I can't comment on that.  We did have a service glitch. I had booked queen beds and we were given a room with two doubles. This was not a big deal, and when I went down the next morning to raise this with the desk staff, she apologized and said we would get a $20/night credit. When we got the bill the next day, however, there was no credit. So I had to trudge down again to get this straightened out. I did eventually get the credit.  The room itself was clean enough but the carpet was old and ugly - same with the";4
Small, good for what I needed it for and close to MSG and One Penn Plaza (For Business) Not sure the price is worth paying for but those are typical NYC rates and you will find that everywhere. The room I had was clean so I would stay here again.;4
I stayed twice at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel and I am quite satisfied for the quality of service and of the room for this hotel in New York.  I can say the restaurant is so so and every morning is a line-up for the breakfast, so you have to go outside, but beside that, I am pleased with this hotel.    However, I would like to teach people staying at a hotel, this is not a community ground and by respect to other people, you should close your door properly and not slam it.  I had two nights at the hotel and I have someone on this floor that first of all, decide to talk on his phone in the hallways, secondly, I have another person, I don't know if they were fighting, but he/she closed her room door and all the walls shaked!!!  Respect - they don't know!;4
Just returned after 4 nights at the New Yorker.  The hotel is right opposite penn station which was fantastic as we got the train from the airport. The hotel is art deco style and has a huge reception . Check in was quick and we arrived in our double room on floor 21.  The room was ok it was slightly outdated decor wise but it was clean and had a bath and a shower. They made the bed each day and changed the towels. The bed was really comfortable and There was a tv and a small wardrobe with a safe in it.  There was no kettle or tea/ coffee facilities which was a shame as all you wanted in the Morning was a coffee. However opposite the hotel is a Starbucks roughly $5 a coffee or a macdonalds about $3 a coffee. There is also 2 supermarkets 1 minute walk next door should you need;4
I stayed in this hotel twice, once in Dec 2004 for my 21st birthday and again in Dec 2006.   I do consider myself to have high standards when it comes to hotels, restaurants etc but for somewhere like New York all you need is a base!   You literally need somewhere to sleep and get ready in the mornings and this place caters for that perfectly.   On my first stay me and my friend had a twin room with a shared bathroom, which, looking back I would probably not do again, however we had no issues getting in to use the bathroom and the room was adequate. Ok, so not all the furniture matches and there was a loud water pipe in the room but it didnt keep us awake, so going back to my original point-it was exactly what we needed. I dont see the point in wasting valuable spending money on;4
"Staying for business in Oct 2017. As hhonors member, was able to pick out room ahead of time and got an 18th floor corner room. Oversized and very nice. Decent gym although two treadmills were broken. One thing about the ""digital key"" -- when I got to hotel, there was a long line to check in, and no separate queue for hhonors members, so I tried to use the mobile app to get the digital key/mobile room access and bypass the checkin. This failed miserably. I asked when I got to the desk, they tried to set it up, but it failed again. This seems not quite ready for prime time.";4
I loved the location.  The rooms were small but the hotel was friendly, helpful and clean.  I had a great bellhop who was very helpful in my arrival.  I had to park my car and ask him to hold my bags.  HIs name was Jeff and he is the guy to ask for. My stay was from this summer, but I just found his card and remembered that I gave him my word that I would give him a great recommendation.  Better late than never!  It's the second time I've stayed there.  No frills but pleasant, clean and helpful.;4
Stayed at the empire for 6 nights in December in the double queen room and enjoyed my stay here. All the staff in the hotel were very helpful and pleasant expect for one receptionist but there's always one so that didn't bother me so much.   Yes, the shower leaks over slightly and hotels could do with a slight revamp but it's not as drastic as other reviews make out. Also the housekeepers informed me of the renovations and how good they were looking already on higher floors. When I got to the empire I was looking for all the things I've read in the reviews but I failed to find any.  Room service was quick and tasty and cocktails were good too! The only complaint I do have is that you can get better value for money in New York. I was satisfied with the hotel but met other;4

If you read some of the reviews on the web, you'll suspect that the place is a dump, with cascades of insects chasing you the half block and across the street, to the steps of Lincoln Center.  Not so.  Is clean, is comfortable, is convenient.  Of course the basic rooms are small.  Rooms are often small in NYC.  Are you in town to watch TV?    My wife and I were assigned a small room after bidding $200 on PriceLine.  Our guest couple received a larger room for the same price.  We were offered an upgrade for $80 a night ($100 for a suite) and refused the offer.  And enjoyed the quiet.   The hotel could be upgraded, and the owners could be less petty.  The showers have a half door, so that you tend to spill water out on the floor.  Yes, the shower mechanism is a bit odd, but the;4
Budget hotel with a really good location. It was really nice to come back to the area after busy days in New York city. Would recommend both the area and the hotel. Worth the money if you compare the prices..;4
"Years ago, when I first dreamt of going to New York, I decided I wanted to stay at the New Yorker. Don't know why, it just appealed to me for some reason. My wish finally came true this month. What a great place to stay. Friendly & helpful staff, clean & comfortable room - a little small, but it is NYC & we barely spent any time there, apart from sleeping!! The Tick Tock Diner is great! As is Trattoria Bianca, the bar & restaurant. Great Cosmopolitans!!! ;) My only small disappointment was that we booked a Metro View Room & there wasn't much of a view, even though we were on the 28th floor. Even so, I wouldn't hesitate in staying there again.";4
Booked a last minute reservation, which usually costs an arm and a leg in Manhattan, but got a great deal.  The room was conveniently located across the street from MSG and was extremely nice.  The room was small, but had every amenity and came at a great price.;4
The Empire Hotel Staff are professional, helpful courteous and Nice! Everyone at Front Desk and Chris bellman stand out. Location across the street from Lincoln Center, good restaurants nearbt, close to American Museum of Natural History. Location + people;4
The room was large and nice. It was so good to find a room at the last minute. This hotel is not far from the airport.I was happy with everything. I was able to shuttle back to the airport in not time.;4
Here the location is everything.  If you are going to Universal it doesnât get much easier, and being near City Walk is a definite plus.  The rooms are oversized and clean, plus I really liked the built in charger station.  This was our second stay and the service was much better this time.  The elevators were improved over last year, and I can tell the hotel is doing what they can to keep it moving, but they are still slow at times.  My biggest complaint was the pool, it becomes deep quick and instead of being at one end it is deep in the middle.  For small kids it doesnât work well.;4
Booked this room last minute to visit a trade show . Found the room to be adequate and the staff very helpful. I would certainly stay again and plan to on my next visit.;4
My family and I visited this hotel for three nights on December 27th-30th, 2018. Upon arrival, we were able to drop off our luggage until time to check in, so we decided to explore the city. When we returned to check-in, the line was a bit long, but it moved fairly quickly. The lobby was nicely decorated with a unique decor. The bar was trendy, but drinks were a bit pricey. One beer was $10. Our room, however, was located on the 8th floor (courtside) away from the hustle and bustle of the city. My biggest complaint was the noise in the wall. It kept me up the first night, and apparently it was the elevator balance chain. One lady said it was the laundry chute, as she was not sure. By the second and third nights, I had grown accustomed to the noise, so it did not bother me as;4
Just back after our 3rd stay great as always Jeff and co always so helpful room was fine we will be back a great location and very comfy bed after walking a great distance everyday  .Jeff got us a car back to jfk super quick and nice driver;4
We enjoyed our stay here. Beautiful views and a very nice pool area. They have a shuttle that goes to Universal Studios and City Walk every 15 minutes;4
We have a great experience and the hotel was perfect for being centrally located for all of Manhattan. However the room was small with 2 double beds. The staff was extremely nice.;4
Staff were very nice and helpful. Hotel is very clean and has a kind of traditional feel. Walking distance to the Universal and City Walk which was ideal. Bus tours will come and pick you up and the hotel. We went to the buffet one night which had a lot of choice. Quite expensive but the food was good quality. There is a starbucks in the hotel which was a godsend in the morning!;4
I recently stayed here for a couple of nights on the tail end of a business trip. The staff were lovely and really helpful. The room was a good size (though I'm rather small), and there was more than enough room. Right in the heart of the Village area of Manhattan, and so many great places to shop and eat. Cafe Gitane on the ground floor has decent food at decent prices and the bar is a good place to meet fellow travellers. I was on the 3rd floor, and the only thing I would say is that if you're a light sleeper, take ear plugs! I was woken at 4am each morning with drunk revellers outside the building and taxi drivers beeping their horns! The noise might be so bad a couple of floors up. Despite this, I would absolutely stay here again!;4
We loved this hotel. Staff were really friendly, Brian on the front desk deserves a mention! The room was modern, clean and spacious. Really comfy beds and one night we ordered a Pizza Hut to the room as we were enjoying chilling out there. Breakfast was great, the man making the omelettes was really friendly even under pressure. Could not fault the hotel at all. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the area the hotel was in seemed a bit shady. It was handy for catching the metro, but nothing to walk out too at night and i didn't feel I would want to walk around there late at night.;4
We stayed here for 2 nights in Dec 2014, and we had booked 5 rooms. - This hotel is 40 mins drive by car from LA International Airport, pretty easy to locate once you enter Universal City. - The hotel entrance is impressive with a massive area for reception, coffee place, seating area and food. - The reception staff was very helpful and helped us allocate all 5 rooms on the same floor (took us some time to wait, but was worth the wait). - Room sizes are pretty decent (big). - Both Valet and Self Parking is available in the hotel basement, parking space is massive. I guess the price is 12 USD per night for car park. - Universal Studios and other attraction tickets are available at a cheaper price in the hotel travel concierge. - Universal Studios is literally 10 mins walk from;4
Great first stay at the Empire hotel. A lovely welcome from charming Pasqaule who offered us free Wi-Fi access for the duration of our stay. This was very appreciated as we were able to call our 2 little boys in St. Maarten each morning and evening! We also had a lovely surprise of 2 complimentary glasses of champagne courtesy of Michael, the receptionist, at our dinner which he booked for us at Boulud Sud. Thank you both! The hotel has a hip bar and lounge which brings some interesting characters and long lines waiting to access it through an elevator in the front lobby area. The lobby and lobby bar are tastefully decorated as are the rooms. The only qualm I have is our room was very small IMO. Not having stayed at hotels in big cities before, I can't say whether a small room;4
"We had a lovely weekend at Hilton Universal!  A quick and easy walk to Universal plus delicious breakfast and decent room service, too.  Check-in and out was smooth and friendly.  Huge room with upgrade view of Universal made for a ""magical"" birthday weekend for our ten year old!";4
This is an enormous and very chaotic hotel, but surprisingly well run.  We were there during the Spring Break/ Easter rush and at times could barely make it through the lobby because of the crowds.  Despite the mayhem, the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.  We got great tips about a last minute trip to Hollywood Blvd from the Concierge and had a wonderful afternoon.  The walk to Universal Studios is easy and it is just a short walk to the Metro as well.  We used the Metro to get to Hollywood Blvd. and it was great.  We didn't use the pool or gym so cannot comment on those amenities.  The room was large and well kept.;4
"The room is quite big for the price, compared to other hotels in NY. The people working there is nice. Internet works fine.  The room was not noisy at all, which is great, and the AC works silently and well.  I took breakfast everyday from the stand they put in the lobby, not so much variation but acceptable.  When booking you have to be aware of the ""hotel fees"" like the extra price per day for the internet access and the fitness center access and this kind of things (so, without option but the WiFi is paid).  Overall, a better experience than other hotels I was previous in NY.";4
I shared a bunk bed cabin with a friend. Tiny room, so tricky with large baggage cases, but clean and comfortable. Not much storage, bar a couple of drawers, so pack light! The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Shared bathrooms were mostly free at all times and were kept clean. Great value and location was unbeatable for easy access to all parts of Manhattan. Transport links were great from 14 Street and it didn't take more than 15 or 20 minutes to get everywhere. Easily accessible to Brooklyn also. Beautiful building and lounge. Corridor did smell of cigarette smoke, though. I would stay here again, but in a larger room next time.;4
Good location, great breakfast, very friendly and dedicated staff. Hugo and the latino women prepare wonderful omelette, scrambled eggs and waffles for breakfast! Definitely a good place to stay. Only nÃ©gative point: the parking of the hÃ´tel is really expensive, but you can Park around for free if you care about the signs in the street.;4
This hotel is such a great location for Universal it is a stones throw away and you canât beat that. It is kind of funny as we stayed at Disney for three nights before moving here and stayed right across from the park as well but at a 50s style Best Western motel with outside entrances. Both spots were perfect, because of location. Location wins over amenities for me as long as itâs safe and clean.  That said I stay at a lot of Hiltons with work and they are usually nice. This property no exception. The service from all staff was impeccable. Our rooms (3) were well maintained and very clean. Our room had a nice view which is always a bonus even though we didnât stay in it much.   We ate breakfast here two out of three morning and typical to Hiltons it was a bit pricey, but it;4
I can highly recommend this hotel. I stay each year at close to 100 nights at various hotels - mostly Hilton Garden Inn, Crowne Plaza, Double Tree, Holiday Inn and some Hiltons. This hotel is far from perfect, but it is pretty good if you are visiting the area for Universal Studios - especially with a family.  The Pros: 5 minute walk from Universal Studios and City Walk Good food options at the hotel. Clean hotel with friendly service. Really good pool area - our kids had a blast. Some Gluten Free options - this was good as two family members are Celiac.  The Cons: Very busy hotel. The hotel, while clean, did seem to show some wear and tear - it is clearly a high volume hotel. They did not make an effort to upgrade our room (HHonors Gold) and said that was due to the hotel being;4
The Empire is a gem.  The location is fabulous - near Central Park (and away from the Times Square madness) plus great shopping nearby.  Very friendly and professional staff from the front desk to the bartender - everyone was terrific.  It's extremely clean and quiet.  Comfortable bed, great linens, good workout room, LOVED the free Wi-fi.  The Empire is a great value for the price especially in New York.  The only negatives were the teeny tiny bathroom with the teak shower floor and the fact that my room was quite warm. I would give it a  5 for cleanliness, but that shower floor :(. I think it's supposed to be chic, but I'm not a fan. That said, I'd definitely visit again.  For a more detailed review & photos please check my blog at www.tripscout.blogspot.com.;4
I've stayed at the Empire Hotel twice now.  The first time I stayed here was May 2014.  We went back to NYC in February 2016 and decided to stay at the same hotel again mainly due to the location.  When you're getting around NYC mainly by subway (which is how we opt to travel) there are a few stations which are preferable to others as they have more lines/services than others.  Columbus Circle is one of these stations so the short walk from the hotel to the station is ideal.  I also think it's an iconic building to look at and the area of Upper West Side is one of my favs in NYC.   The hotel rooms are compact, as youâd expect in NYC. They are fully equipped and have everything youâd need from hairdryer to iron to complimentary toiletries from Bigalows.  The towels are always;4
Likes: The room is spacious and well-presented. Complimentary breakfast includes freshly made omelette and waffles. Convenient to order take-out to your hotel room and laundry only costs $5. Although the hotel does not provide adapter, you can get one at the gift shop that only costs $2.50. Surprisingly the shampoo and conditioner are of very good quality. Other amenities are also good, including beautifully folded towels, pillows. Free Wi-Fi.   Dislikes: The corridor is quite dark, the room is dimly lit. Second floor looks shabby and I had to request to have the room changed to first floor. There is no security safe in the room. There is a connecting door to another room, which does not seem to be secured. Floor is not carpeted, so it's cold and there are no slippers provided.;4
The building is old and there are smoking rooms and smoking floors, which for my non-smoking travel companion was a problem (though I didn't mind).  At first they messed up our reservation and put is in a double room instead of a queen.  With a quick call to the lobby, we were upgraded to a suite with a queen and a separate living room.  Very nice!    Also, take advantage of the breakfast deal with the Europa across the street, totally worth it.;4
Our room location was quiet and comfortable. Room service was good. Nice medium sized room and bathroom. Close to subway and central park. Heating and air conditioning worked well. Nice little refrigerator.;4
The stay at Morningside Inn was absolutely fine. The room was clean, the other things as described. 24 h help if needed. Plus an extra luggage room if you have to check out before your flight goes. Wifi could be a little more efficient. All in all: a nice stay at a great located place!;4
Old but good hotel . Room size ok . Bathroom bigger compared to other hotels . Amazing location . Restaurant has variety of options. Again , compared to thee hotels , staff is better , helpful and pleasant. Looks like one of the 60s premium hotel . Value for money .;4
We have stayed at this Hilton twice now. It is the closest hotel to our sons home so that was why we chose it the first time. It is big and has lots to offer. We were pleased with the room size and the good service we have gotten from all the staff. Check in has been easy both times, our rooms always ready. We stayed here first in October, then again over Christmas. I was a little disappointed with the holiday decorations, I expected them to be incredible, but that is not a reason to chose a hotel. The carpets the second time did show lots of wear and dirt which surprised me. They have large, very ornate carpeting and it looked horrible. They were trying to dry out some leakage in October so perhaps this caused the staining? This hotel gives you a voucher for a continental;4
The Empire Hotel was in a great location to visit family, Lincoln Center (right across the street), and easy subway access.  Although the hotel was on the older side, our room was very comfortable and quiet.  Our window overlooked Lincoln Center which was very pretty to see in the day and night.  Check-in took a little longer than expected, but they did add another desk clerk which helped.;4
The hotel is in an amazing location 2minutes walk from central park and broadway shows. Rooms were all you need and very clean and warm, staff were very friendly and helpful  some great places to eat nearby but do try the street carts as they provide good value food and drinks;4
2 adults staying 5 nights. Requested 2 beds, had a queen instead. To compensate, they gave us the corner room (Level 15, room 70).  Cons: - Aircon: manual on/off button, no remote so had to get up during the night to turn on. Also, the vent is in one corner of the room, the rest get nothing.  - Laundry services: Very expensive, $15USD for a t-shirt. Find a local laundromat or air dry in the bathroom. - Elevators: very VERY slow. Notices were put everywhere advising this would be upgraded later in the year (so Dec 2016) - Bath tub is also the shower, not suitable for mobility impaired. Could easily replace the corner table for a standalone shower.  - Shops/Grocery store is a fair walk (if you don't have a car which we did not have) probably not a good idea to walk in 40 degree;4
"Arrived June 2 about 1:30 pm and the room was ready! We were thrilled we could put our belongings into the room as we had a 3:30 time for the 9/11 Memorial. The Empire is located about a Block from the 1 subway which took no time at all to get to the Financial District (Rector Street exit). The drain is the bathroom was not working, we mentioned to a very pleasant housekeeper and front desk. It was completely fixed when we arrived back to the room later.  We had a lovely room, 2nd floor, 2 double beds and a love seat for 3 women which was perfect and very quite. The love seat wound up perfect for one in our group, she is very petite and made her ""nest"" there for the night. Prior to check in, I filled out the room request that was emailed to me which I had asked for an extra robe";4
We booked via our travel agent. We had a room with two double beds which were reasonably comfortable. The room decor was good. The bathroom was small and a little dated, but ok. Water temperature is strangely set at 'hot'! the shower and bath cold taps were closed off. We used cold water from the sink, poured out of the ice-bucket, into the bath to cool down the hot water. The room air-con worked fine and was welcome. There are plenty of lifts. Some go from ground to floor twenty, the rest go from floor twenty to upper fortieth floors. The 20-40 floor lifts broke down one evening, which meant a walk up the service stairs from floor twenty to ours on the twenty fifth floor. The staff were mostly pleasant. We enjoyed using the Business Centre (in the basement) to access the;4
"I was very pleased over all with my stay at the Empire Hotel.  The location was great and I got a really good price for the room. The staff was pleasant and helpful.  I needed an iron and ironing board and ordered room service in the morning and both were brought very promptly. My only complaint was about noise.  My room was right at the elevator and I heard noises until the wee hours and again early in the morning.  Plus there was construction outside of my window that started early on Monday morning, but of course that's not the hotel's fault.  There were a lot of items for sale and that was nice except they were VERY expensive.  I dropped my toothbrush on the bathroom floor and had to purchase the $17 Smile Kit.  There also was a $38 ""Intimacy Kit"" out in the open that anyone";4
I've stayed at this place several times and was never disappointed. The rooms are huge by New York standards. They are extremely clean. And my rooms are usually very quiet. (I usually request upper floors in New York to distance myself from the street noise.) The kitchen facilities are a plus so you can have a light breakfast and coffee in the room. A grocery store is convenient, as is a major subway station. Easy walk to Lincoln Center. Don't expect maid service or room service. It is an apartment house. Safe neighborhood. I'll be back there soon.;4
Had a wonderful few days here.  Room was spacious and bright and clean.  Comfortable bed with nice bed linens.  Front desk staff were incredibly nice and helpful.  My only negative comments are: 1. the pool area..  the reason I chose the hotel was because there was a pool with loungers to relax by.  But there was very loud music playing continually so I couldnât use this area.  What a pity.  It could be so nice up there.  My friend and I went up to have lunch but didnât stay because of the loud music.  I understand having music in the bar on the floor below, but why not make the pool area peaceful and relaxing?  Surely Itâs what people need in a busy city like NY? - Twice I found a small cockroach in my bathroom.  The bathroom and bedroom were very clean so cleanliness wasnât an;4
We arrived exhausted from the Middle East and were so grateful for a bed we didnât really focus on how small our room was until the next day when the money we were paying didnât equate to the size of the room. Luckily, after speaking to reception a MUCH larger room was found which was brilliant.  A great spot for walking from and fair value for money for nyc. The diner downstairs was a typical ny diner which was great to experience. Breakfast fast and good.;4
Check in and concierge very efficient and helpful. We got there at the same time as huge coachload arrived. Luckily, the Hilton Honors line was free, but we still had to wait a little while for someone to notice us. The room was furnished well, but with a lack of drawer and cupboard space for a longer stay. Our room was starting to look a little tired and ready for an overhaul perhaps, although the bed was very comfortale.  An unfortunate incident meant we spilt some micro-ground coffee powder. We let the maid know and went out for the day. On our return we were surprised to note that she had attempted to clean it with a damp cloth rather than use a vacuum cleaner on the dry powder. Needless to say, there was a nasty stain remaining on the carpet. This did not spoil our visit,;4
I stayed there for three days and will return again. The main reasons -price and location. The location is in between Chelsea and Greenwich village.  Walking distance from both. Nice to stay in a quiet part of town far from Time Square but close enough for a quick visit. Heres a few things to keep in mind about the hotel: 1. The rooms are small. Smaller than a room on a cruise ship. Although small, its loaded with tv, fan, plenty of elec. outlets, hangers, wifi, and storage space.  2. Its not a 5 star hotel so the decor is old but historic. Carpets are old and soiled so bring your flip flops!  3. Shared bathroom. Its clean and never came across anyone in there but its a shared facility for the entire floor.  4. There is a night club on the ground floor. The lobby was super;4
Very nice Hilton and so close to Universal and City Walk they even have a shuttle but it is a nice walk.  No free continental breakfast though they do have a restaurant that does serve breakfast starting at $18 and also no refrigerator which we always find nice to have.  Be prepared to pay for parking either self park or valet.  The room was very spacious and well appointed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.;4
I am a picky traveler and am used to staying at top notch hotels for work. During a personal business trip, I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during the Oscars weekend. It was in a great location - close to everything. The room was clean and HUGE, and the beds were so comfortable. Wish they had free wi-fi and better parking costs. There is a hefty charge even for Self Parking. You cannot park on the street as there is nothing around.;4
The Jane Hotel feels like a place a Wes Anderson film was based on. Well designed, everything is considered, but still subtle, charming, authentic and low key. Everyone told me not to stay there because of the small rooms and communal bathrooms, but everything is tight quarters in New York - so deal with it - it's only $100 a night and in a great part of town! Plus, I think that adds to the charm and immediately attracts a unique breed of clientele to the place. It's like sleeping on a boat. Even if you don't stay there, the bar is awesome. Free open wifi is a huge plus too. The only negative I had was the smell of cigarette smoke in my room.;4
This hotel is a great location and very close to subway station that has 3 trains that go through it. ( line1,2,3) . Very close to Central park . We stayed in NewYork for 4 days and every day we would get out of the hotel, walk few steps to subway station and we are off to our destination.  There are lot of resturants and grocery shops around the hotel within walking distance. There is a cafe just downstairs around the corner.   The rooms are very clean and the room rates are pretty reasonable comapred to other expensive hotels in timesquare and lower manhattan.   I would stay here on my next visit.;4
Nice hotel and rooms and love the location. My only complaints were with housekeeping. The mouthwash was already opened and when they replaced it they left the empty bottle on the counter. table looked like it was moved and crooked, towels were super sloppy and when they did the turn down service they only did it for one person when there were two people. (Robe,sheets, candy).;4
Stayed at the Ameritania for a few nights last week. A larger hotel but decorated boutique style. I had a street facing room that was a little loud. Decor and size of the room was great. The bed was comfortable, with a good sized bathroom. I would stay again if the opportunity presents itself.;4
We stayed for a week in this hotel. The room was clean and quiet, with AC,  flat screen TV, 2 queen size beds that made it very difficult to go from the door to the other side of the room.  The bathroom was tiny. Food at the restaurant was OK.  Located 10 min away from Penn Station and a few more minutes from Macy's, the location was perfect.  The only complain.... extremely pricy!!!!!!!!;4
We are currently staying here as it was reasonably close to Olympia where we are volunteering for the beer festival.  The staff have been helpful, not overly friendly but they have dealt with all enquiries efficiently. The room we have is small but clean and serves the purpose. Good location for tube and getting around London.  You need to ask for a hairdryer and put a Â£5 deposit down which you get back when you return it which is fair enough. Room was cheap for London so no complaints so far.;4
Close to nearby parks, eateries, bars, gyms, jogging/bike paths, shopping and museums galore!  You can manage to squeeze in a lot during your visit of the city.   Great to bring your family during your business trip, so much to see and do.;4
Just back from staying at the New Yorker. Hotel lobby is beautiful. Love the Art Deco elements of it. Room had no view at all but we were hardly in the room. Great shower and bathroom. Room a decent size and had Art Deco furniture and accessories. We had coffee making machine in the room and we were given fresh bottles of water everyday by housekeeping, we paid for a fridge and I would recommend you do that. $30 one off fee. Rooms have a safe. The room was very clean. Iâd say 90% of staff were friendly and helpful. Great location for station, shopping and sites. Tick Tock diner and Italian bar and restaurant on site which are great for ease of use but very expensive. We did Tick Tock twice. Nice food and good service. We would stay there again.;4
Members of my family (London $ USA) have been staying at this property for decades.  I always stay here for performances at Met Opera.  Recently renovated and all the rooms I have booked have been very large with a bedroom area and seating area each with its own TV. Closet space is scant, however. No room service but there is a restaurant (PJ Clark's) right outside the front door in the same building that serves brunch lunch and dinner with a pretty extensive drink and food menu.  Plenty of other restaurants in this upper west side neighborhood.  No, it is not super elegant but for Lincoln Center patrons who only use it as a place to flop after culture and dining, it is great.  Close to the #1 subway 66th st station for folks coming from NJ (us) and Long Island.;4
This hotel is in a great location. We stayed a week and with 2 kids our room was a little small for us as was the bathroom. The shower was hot and did fluctuate often, but you get that with older buildings. Check in was easy, the security at the lift was constant. The staff were helpful each time I needed them. We hired a fridge for our room which was brought up promptly & was perfect for our milk etc for kids. Servicing was up to standard. The Tick Tock diner was great with great food. We had a view of W35th St from the 35th floor.   Our stay was pleasant.;4
We came to NYC for a particular performance at the Met and were delighted to find that the Empire was only about 100 yards away. It is beautifully placed for the Lincoln Centre and Central Park (one block away). Staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. Room a bit tired but bed large and comfortable. The heating/aircon made the sort of noises you'd expect from a film cartoon of a Heath Robinson machine, but it did heat the room fast (zero outside, so important). Internet access for airlines free and quick. We skipped their breakfast as it was a bit expensive and instead went to Fiorello's across the street (look right out of the main door). All in all, a wonderful trip. No idea of value as booked as a package by Trailfinders.;4
We had an amazing room, massive.. especially for NY. large plasma, sofa, massive bed and great wet room. only down side was the 'no change' bar and a birthday card Â£10 note went missing.  not too bad, i snaffled the pringles and the mini bar to make up for it.;4
We stayed two nights at the Empire Hotel June 4-6, 2018. I should tell you first that my husband won a trip to New York City to attend a movie premiere, so our stay was free. Yay! The location was great for us. Right across the street from the Lincoln Center, where our event was being held. Ballet, David Geffen Hall, and Juilliard School are all right there. Short walk to Central Park (Strawberry Fields is on the SW end of the park, so that was convenient too). Plenty of nearby restaurants. The hotel lobby is beautiful with sitting areas and a small bar. Restrooms and more seating areas on second floor that overlook the lobby. Check-in went smoothly and quickly.  Room 210. Room and bathroom were clean and up-to-date. Yes, it was small, even smaller and darker than anticipated,;4
We loved the Jane so much! my boyfriend and I were not looking to be pampered in a 5 star hotel like it seems some of the reviewers of the Jane are looking for. The room was a bit smokey & pretty small but a bunk TOTALLY works for 2 people. It is kind of tight, but big deal. We didn't go on vacation to New York to say in our room for hours on end. We really loved how the Jane was decorated..it seems like it would have looked the same inside 100 years ago! The old-school ambiance gave the Jane a very special and exciting feel. Bathrooms were totally clean and fresh. I had never stayed at a hotel where bathrooms were communal, but these were much cleaner and nicer than I had ever expected communal bathrooms to be. I would definitely recommend the Jane to travelers looking to have;4
Prime location, large and clean Jr. Suite, quiet room (10th floor). Spartan breakfest, no coffee machine or tea in the room, WiFi router next to the room was broken, poor to none AT&T cellular reception in the room. Took 3 days to fix WiFi after numerous complains to front desk and Housekeeping. Overall - OK but I will look for something better next time for $3,500 per 7 nights.;4
Overalll this hostel, which in our opinion exceeded all expectations for a hostel, was an excellent choice in accomodation within close proximity via highly accessoble public transport to all major tourist attractions.  Location: The hostel is in Hammersmith,  a great neighbourhood and approximately 3 minutes from the main bus and train stations both of which have easy access to London and popular areas such as Shepeherds Bush for Westfield (one of the largest shopping centres in Europe) and Notting Hill. Room and Amenities: We stayed on the first floor in a private double room with an ensuite bathroom-shower, basin and toilet. The room was very clean and comfortable and serviced our basic needs which were to sleep and shower. The only thing ee would add is that given we chose;4
Just returned from a lovely stay at this hotel. The entrance lobby is wonderfully grand and really takes you back to another era. Reception staff were very helpful and friendly . Yes there was a queue but this is a huge hotel and to be expected I think.  Rooms are basic but very clean and serviced daily and again with a 1930s feel. We were on the 22nd floor and was quite noisy at night but nothing a set of earplugs can't solve. Tick Tock Diner was excellent . Had two evening meals and one breakfast there and both were super. Service excellent and always friendly . Also tried the Italian attached to the hotel which is not fast food and although more pricy (to be expected) the food was lovely, much more of a restaurant in every way. As for location , then this one is perfect for;4
"Pros: outstanding breakfast buffet with waffle/omelet/eggs prepared to your order by chef; lovely older building with a decent renovation; good location; beds and linens are great; pool is nice (even though you have to cross the parking lot to get  to it (?)  Cons: Service was mediocre service at best, and in one instance was unacceptable (more below); wi-fi is slow and difficult to connect to; TV was unusable (for us); building is noisy, but that is what you get for the convenient location; hair in the shower (EEK!!)and parking (if you don't have a deal) adds a lot to the price (over $20 a day).  Review: My son (12 yrs old) and I stayed on a weeknight, and I got a great deal through TripAdvisor ($140 prepaid included all taxes, fees, AND parking for a room with two queen beds).";4
"Nice hotel with a good central location, just steps from Penn Station. Check-in was nice and we (presumably) got an upgrade as our room was more of a suite. Only problem was the wi-fi in the room was horrible. Poor connection and the speed consistently dropped. We had a lot of work to do and had counted on being able to hang out in the room.  On the plus side, the water pressure in the shower was really good. (Not something I would normally remember...).  We had the ""no housecleaning/do not disturb"" sign on the door which housekeeping just ignored, too. Very odd.  In other news... The fitness center was pretty nice, especially for a hotel. The diner attached to the lobby was a good, traditional diner. Big menu and good food.";4
What a gorgeous hotel and very helpful staff. We turned up 10 mins before checking in time and room wasn't ready & told to come back in 45 mins.  After an hour the room still wasn't ready.  After a long flight we just wanted to get into our rooms and seeing how stressed I was,  a very helpful Muhammad at reception sorted me out with a room & for our inconvenience also gave us a very nice upgrade (a room with a view! - Empire State building no less)! The room was spacious and clean, only disappointment is that there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  Unfortunately our safe in the room was not working and the kindly let us have a safe behind reception until they managed to sort the problem out.  The hotel is in a fantastic location just beside Times Square and all;4
The goods: Right next to Universal. Free shuttle, every 20 minutes or so. Clean, comfortable rooms with mini fridge.   The bad: $8 daily for wifi. $35 daily for self parking. $32 per person for breakfast.   In summary, you pay for a room to be close to Universal and thats itâ¦ all the other amenities you normally get with Hilton are extra.;4
We recently stayed at Hilton Universal city for 2 nights whilst visiting Universal Studios. The hotel is spacious, clean, great size rooms and in a great location for visiting Universal Studios, however is a bit isolated for any other exploring. We were a little surprised that as Hilton Gold members, that despite our room being ready, we were charged $25 for an early check in, however after a long flight from Australia, it was worth it! The seafood buffet was fantastic, such a huge selection of good quality food available, so well worth a visit, the breakfast was also very good. You can walk to Universal Studios and City Walk in less than 5 minutes. Great spot for Universal.;4
I'm so shocked by all of the negative reviews for this hotel. When I found out that this was where my fiance had booked for us to stay, I was full of dread after reading the reviews. These feelings couldn't have been more mistaken. We turned up at about 1.30am (which was later than we thought because we had to wait an age for our bags due to the machinery being frozen!) and the welcome we got was so friendly. They had also upgraded our room, so we were in one of the newly renovated rooms on the Pent House floor. They even told us that if we were hungry the cafe on the corner was open until 2am. When we got up there, our room was lovely, clean and comfortable, as was the bathroom. We had no issues with noise and had a very comfortable stay (and we stayed for six nights). Location;4
"We had a pleasant stay at the Empire hotel, the Lobby is beautiful and the staff is very professional.  We started to chat with someone from reception and after a few minutes we received great advice on restaurants for our anniversary dinner.  We had booked a standard room online with this website.  We thought we had a good deal until the front desk told us that the room we had reserved was actually a ""Petite Queen room"" There was absolutely no mention of it on the website, which was very misleading.  Be careful when you book your own room.  The man at front desk was able to find another room for us, he wasn't able to give the upgrade complementary but was able to reduce it by a lot.  We then went on to the bar to order two glasses of champagne, and it seemed like the pour was";4
So I can't lie the hotel pictures online are much nicer,they were clearly taken when it was first refurbished, it's nice enough but the place has wear and tear now,if your from UK it's premier Inn vibes,but it was clean and a absolutely fantastic comfy bed which you need as new york is alot of walking,but the one thing I can say with my chest is the staff are all amazing, welcoming and friendly with great advice and honest opinions, Iceiz and Jeff where the best ever and helped us navigate NY with ease and every suggestion they had didn't fail us, Jeff even drew us out a map of what to do and how to navigate the subway, the two of them made our trip and I couldn't thank them enough, lovely people and professional with such nice vibes,this hotel is such a great location it's;4
Excellent location central to the subway and park. Rooftop bar was excellent and an extensive menu to match. Could not fault the service or rooms. Short walk to delicious other food options and a good supermarket right below;4
Facing Central Park, just great!- tick Close to B&C subway stations - tick Helpful and kind staff, especially Alain Amid, who gave useful hints for my debut in NY  - tick Clean bed, towels and  bathroom - tick Great shower - tick The rest is up to your flip-flop and the streets of New York ! Ah! Don't miss Giovanni's Pizza. Simple place, warm people and great pizza, of course!!!!! It is located few blocks from the hotel.;4
Basic accommodation in an excellent location, beds were very small, breakfast  option worth the $10 each. Front door staff excellent and helpful.  Guy behind the bar was great, but on one night there was a woman behind the bar and she tried to charge us twice for drinks very poor.;4
We stayed the week before Christmas 2022. We found the hotel to be very conveniently located between Times Square and Central Park, each less than half a mile away and a subway station across the road. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Jeff the doorman. The hotel itself was very good, with nice rooms and a great view of Broadway from our bedroom window. I canât fault it in any way, would definitely recommend.;4
"Second visit to this hotel and so glad I chose it. It's basically right across the street from Penn Station, so you walk out of the train and you're there. I was just up for a short weekend and found it super convenient. After I checked out I checked my bag with the bell captain and had a lovely day visiting museums and taking in a matinee, then walked the 10 blocks back from Times Square, picked up the bag and went right back to the train station.  The rooms are a decent size for NY, and the employees are very accommodating. My only complaint (and it's a very little one) is that the young woman who checked me in offered spontaneously to reduce the $29 ""resort fee"" to $10 since my stay was too short for me to actually use the facilities other than wifi. I thought that was very";4
The location is excellent !  Near Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center, Central Park and the Upper West Side.   Starbucks is right next store plus a great places to eat.  The staff was fabulous ( Thank you Rudy !)  and even upgraded my room and provided me with free internet access.  The room was clean, bed great and on the 9th floor it was very quiet outside of the usual NEW York City occasional street noise.  I had also read many negative reviews - which I found none of those circumstances to be true and the elevators worked perfectly.  I would stay here again.;4
Just got back from a long weekend staying at the Ameritana. The hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square, Central Park and loads of restaurants.  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful as we're all the doormen especially Jeff! To the manager - Jeff deserves a pay rise! He goes beyond the call of duty doing his job. He's very helpful and approachable and is a pleasure to talk to. The hotel was modern, clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 12th floor so noise didn't bother us but you're in New York!  It can be noisy! I didn't use the bar do can't comment but there are plenty close by anyway. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying here.;4
Good price, but beware hidden charges. 4 night stay incites a further $129 in facility fees, then you have to pay $5 dollars for your luggage to be looked after...so whatâs the facility fee for exactly?? Room are small but clean. The saving grace for me was John at the Concierge desk, an absolute diamond, couldnât do enough for me...here in the city alone for work, so kind and helpful! Good location, right by MSG & Penn Station so the whole of New York is very accessible! Must visits Tavola Italian on 9th & Carraghers Bar for all you sports fans! Enjoy NYC it really doesnât sleep!!;4
This was a difficult review to write because the 1st person a met was one of the valet parking staff I hadnât blocked anything & we were popping in to get our room then self park. She demanded my car keys which were even as I explained it was just a pop in. Check in was friendly nothing special internet policy not explained. We went & self parked (expensive) tried to get the free shuttle to City Walk (infrequent) asked door staff for directions and were vaguely pointed in the direction of City Walk.  The room was great well appointed, although TV, fridge & coffee machine were not working, we called reception, technician came fiddled with the plug & told us that housekeeping always knock these out! For me this really is not the Hilton way, why not check everything works before;4
I stayed here with my wife and daughter and had a wonderful time. all the staff were welcoming and very happy to help with all of our questions. the location was perfect for us with an easy walk to whatever we needed. would recommend to stay here without hesitation.;4
Location and room very good (for business & pleasure), and the uniqueness of this hotel is grand. Inside staff and concierge are excellent. But the bellman are not helpful or friendly, so good luck finding a taxi!;4
"Great location if you're going to Universal Park! The hotel is located right off the freeway and is walking distance from hotel; free shuttle also available! We did both for Park and  Citywalk! The hotel is not far from the Griffith Observatory. Also, tour buses provide pickup at the hotels entrance.  Our king room was newly renovated, spacious and comfortable! The Concierge, Jesse, was terrific!";4
But there's a great hotel underneath the iconic UWS sign. It's literally across the street from Lincoln Center not to mention Century 21 & Bed, Bath & Beyond. The lobby is a pretty Art Deco meeting place & the roofdeck has a small actually tiny pool but a SPECTACULAR view of the UWS. The service is lovely & personal. You can easily walk to Central Park & a great choice of restaurants are a stone's throw away. You will be pleasantly surprised.;4
"Property was okay and the front desk staff was very helpful.  Can't remember the exact day of the week we stayed; but, it was about $150 plus tax.  We contemplated stay an additional night; but the cost doubled to over $300, which was definitely not worth it.  Lobby was neat however the elevators (Really small); hallways; and our room appeared not to have been updated in some time.  Room temperature was an issue.  We were there during the cold snap in December, 2017 and the hotel had the heat cranked up - no means of control the heat so we actually had to run the air conditioner to make the room comfortable.";4
The Empire Hotel's location makes it great for anyone wanting to enjoy Central Park. Only a block away, from the park and a 15 minute walk to times square. Rooms are nice, staff friendly. If you are thinking of a hotel in NY, then consider The Empire. Make sure you ask for the very friendly and helpful Mr.Zee and Pasquale. Connected to the hotel is a Starbucks and a pub. Perfect really.;4
The Empire remains THe Hotel for opera, ballet or theater visitors. It is showing its age, but management is making good moves in renovation. The biggest problem remains heating/air conditioning.  Too warm or too cold.;4
We were very pleased with our choice of hotel for sight seeing in New York. It was very close to, Central Park, the Metropolitan Opera House, shopping on 5th Avenue, Times Sqare and the Empire State Building. The hotel was very comfortable, and the staff were very helpful.;4
very well located in the hub of time square, very vibrant and busy hotel, free wifi and friendly staff, The breakfast is a bit expensive, but you will find many bakery and coffee shops near by. I stay at Wyndham hotel and recommended to many friends, up to now nobody complained , in fact all of them come back to thank me.;4
It had been a few years since my hostel days and I honestly thought they were over, but when I came across the amazing pricing of this cabin at the Jane (70 USD/night), in the heart of the meatpacking district, I couldn't resist  The hotel had amazing reviews, also helped by its bar and restaurant which I have come to understand are particularly hot spots for the new 20s generation. I have tried both and can confirm cocktails are properly done, and served in a retro / baroque charming ambience, and cafÃ© Gitane is really good, a sort of a sofisticated diner with a decent wine list  So, coming to the review of the hotel, here are the key elements I was concerned about:  - Shared bathroom (no wonder). Nowhere I had found how many rooms actually share the bathroom, this is an;4
Cons:The whole time during our stay there was an overwhelming noxious odor of marijuana coming from a neighboring room(s). The bed and pillows were extremely uncomfortable to sleep on, the a/c in our room hardly worked, the parking is expensive per night, the dining options are pretty lackluster.  Pros: The bar is pretty nice, and the guys working there were really friendly and accommodating. The front desk and housekeeping staff were all very friendly. The property was clean and well maintained.;4
We went to Manhattan and stayed at the New Yorker Hotel.  We have been there before and love the style and atmosphere and design.  They house the Tik Tok Diner which is a great and reasonably priced family restaurant.  Our room was a two bedroom suite and very spacious.  We had asked and hoped for a better view - last time we had a great view of the Empire State Building - but can't get everything.  We went to see Beetlejuice.  The New Yorker is convenient to all of the theater district.  It also has great subway access, the 34th Street Station is right there.  Hoped on the subway and it was a ten minute ride up to the Museum of Natural History, which we always wanted to see.  We had a minor plumbing issue in the bathroom that didn't get resolved but it was a weekend and did not;4
We usually visit friends in the city, but decided to stay here for its central location and ease of access to Penn Station. The location for those travelling in and out of Port Authority, Penn Station or one one of the midtown bus stops, is pretty amazing. We were just a short walk from our bus stop.   The hotel is very historic, which was the dealmaker for us on this property vs. others in midtown. The lobby is a beautiful Art Deco one and the bottom floor with the fitness center has a mini museum on the hotel.   The hotel has been renovated, and while its very old, thats part of the charm: Winding hallways, old elevators, etc. The room we had was small, but all we really needed was a place to sleep and shower- for a longer visit, it may have been close quarters. Even though we;4
This hotel has a great rooftop bar and club. The location could not be better around the upper west side.  It is across from Lincoln square and 2 blocks from Central Park. It is also near Columbus circle so transportation in subway is easy.  The hotel is older but has a luxury decor.  The rooms are tiny but do not lack amenities.;4
"Just stayed there - we were greeted by a very helpful Nick at the front desk - He got us upgraded to a king room.   The room was relatively large by New York standards.  Only a few annoying things - $3.00 for a cup of do it yourself coffee - most other places in NY provide this free and even though we had the ""do not disturb"" showing, housekeeping knocked on our door and announced themselves at 9:00am on a Sunday morning -";4
Average sized rooms for this age of hotel. Good value. Excellent Gym. Close to time square and other things to do. Close to subway and penn station;4
We stayed here for 4 days and enjoyed our stay.  We were traveling with kids and grandkids.  We had been traveling for 33 hrs and asked to check in early and they did their best to accomodate us, getting our rooms ready in a very short time.  I found the staff to be friendly. Sometimes I find you are treated in the same manner you treat others.  I had asked a couple questions online before we arrived and manager was very prompt in answering any concerns I had.  We recommend it.;4
Really nice hotel in a 5 star location. Special shout out to the manager on duty - Danny, who was more than helpful and welcoming when I checked in after 12hrs of travel!  Thanks again! Will definitely be back next time I'm in town;4
This was my first ever trip to NYC to celebrate my 30th birthday and Empire hotel made it a very special one. The hotel lobby is lush, the location is fab right next to central park and the staff were amazing. A special thanks to Yuri (the concierge) for my complimentary bottle of champagne to toast my birthday! And also a thank you to both Yuri and Chris for sorting out my birthday surprise from my boyfriend (who wasn't on the holiday with me), he arranged for some birthday balloons and a teddy bear to be sent to my room on my birthday which was a complete surprise!   The rooftop bar and pool were lovely but we didn't get the chance to use them as there was so much to see and do in NYC! Plus we were flying out to Miami a few days later where we would have plenty of time to;4
The Astor was Excellent value. The staff on the desk were helpful and courteous. The rooms are very clean and comfortable for the price. I would recommend the hotel any time. Thanks to all for an excellent stay.;4
What a find. Right next to Penn station. Convenient to the Lincoln tunnel. Very affordable. Everything you need is in the building or nearby.Staff is very professional. Valet parking is very swift and convenient. Stayed twice over a two week period. This is my new firstchoice in NYC.;4
Hollywood Hotel suited my budget and desire to be near Hollywood and have easy access to public transport. I hadn't paid too much attention to the facilities when booking so was really happy with how comfortable the bed was and such a spacious room, with fast Wi-fi and a private balcony as well as lots of lovely relaxation spaces scattered around the property. Breakfast was included in the tariff. Travelling on my own, it was so nice to have welcoming smiles and little chats with the staff making custom-omelettes, fried eggs and waffles for breakfast each morning. Fruit, pastries, cereal, toast, juices too - a great start to the day in every way. Convenient to a range of takeaway and eat-in dining, a Rite-Way and best of all - buses and the Santa Monica/Vermont railway station.;4
Very nice room..fairly spacious for an NYC hotel...comfy bed...plenty good stuff to see and eat within a close proximity...reminds me of a 'W' hotel in many respects. Dim lights & dark colors...Trance music in the lobby...rooftop club hopping into the night.  Two problems.   #1. My company was paying for the room & tax. All taken care of. But they would not let me check in because I did not have a valid credit card for incidentals. (my credit card was stolen the night before and I was in the middle of going through the nonsense that ensues.) They said I could put down an exorbitant amount of cash to cover (but I didn't have, not could I get the cash) Their 'policy' basically had me sitting in the lobby for 5-6 hours waiting for help to arrive in the form of a co-worker who could;4
This was the third I have stayed at the Empire Hotel.  The location is ideal and the rooms are comfortable and excellent value for the price. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely return to the Empire on my next visit to New York. Highly recommended!,;4
Hello, my wife and I spent a total of 10 days at the Empire Hotel. First of all, I have to say that we felt very comfortable there and recommend the hotel to everyone. The hotel and decor has come down a bit but it has a little more charm. The rooms are clean and the staff is really more than friendly. We had two special concerns and they were both fulfilled. Especially Nohan, the friendly front desk manager, was very accommodating and gave a lot of good tipss for our stay. The location is perfect, you are not right in the loud core of the city but can also have its peace. You get along well everywhere.;4
The Hyatt Regency is the closest hotel to the airport terminals. In fact, you can actually walk to the airport safely.   The hotel shuttle was pretty quick, but made a stop at the parking garage next to the hotel. Check in was very quick and friendly.  The hotel lobby has been redone, and it is very spacious with bars and a restaurant.   The hotel room was very comfortable. I loved the decor in the space with the touches of yellow in the accent colors. The bed was very comfortable, there was a huge sofa in the room, the desk was efficient, and the restroom a decent size.  My room overlooked the garage so there wasnât much of a view. It seems that the other side of the hotel has a view of planes landing.   Overall, the stay was very nice. Service was good and the hotel room was;4
I had been in New York before and I didn't like the city. Found it very difficult to find food and drink. Turns out the problem was the location. This hotel was across the road from some really good restaurants and was close to the metro. Really enjoyed my stay this time. We had a lovely view from room the staff were fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay here and would stay again.;4
This hotel is in a great location for the mid to mature traveller.  Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle are nearby.  There are several nice restaurants to dine at within walking distance of the Empire and let's not forget a Strabucks on the same block.  My only qualm is that the beds are not conducive to a great night's sleep.  My star rating goes to a lobby desk staffperson by the name of Gunita.  She provided a level of service that left me saying thank you to her!  For my anniversary, she sent me a note of well wishes.  Now that isn't just customer service but 100% customer care!;4
Spent two nights on a business trip. The room was very small bit clean, quiet and functional. The elevators are very very slow. The location isn't super special but convenient.   This wouldn't be my first choice of a NYC hotel  but is a very nice option for traveling on a budget and very convenient location - next to Penn station and many subway lines.;4
Very nice, clean hotel -- exactly what you would expect from Hilton. The concierge was extremely helpful as were all staff members. Position is perfect for those planning an early start at Universal Studios.;4
So pleased that Wyndham has taken over this historic Art Deco gem of a property. The hotel is in excellent condition and the location can't be beat for its proximity to Penn Station, the subway, the High Line. A terrific diner and an upscale restaurant are welcome amenities -- and if your package includes Continental Breakfast, the views from the 39th floor breakfast room are spectacular!;4
next to universal studios and lots of restarants and eateries but nothing else close by bring what ever u need with you no shops drug or liqour stores within walking distance shop in hotel very limited shuttle from hotel to universal city;4
Its an old but well kept hotel and the biggest advantage is that once you are parked in their garage you dont have to worry about going to Universal from there. You can walk or take a shuttle. We arrived at 11pm on a friday evening and were given key for a room in which someone was already living so when we tried to open the door, the residents inside were shocked and we would have been too if someone tried to open our door when we were sleeping so that was a bad mistake made by reception. But other than that, very friendly service, great room and great view of Universal from our room. Would love to go back.;4
The room was great (1124) spacious and clean.  I was surprised to see there was a fee to use pods for the Keurig, paying that much for a room it seemed a bit cheesy.  Check in/Check out and door ppl were helpful and friendly.  Concierge was a waste of space in a town where space and customer service is a premium.  Had 1 drink in the bar, well stocked and the bartender was good.  The adjacent Chowder House had a good bar as well and according to the hubs a great seafood chowder.;4
Lovely hotel in great location. Really close to the metro, Central Park, Time Sq, Broadway, shops restaurants etc. Rooms are quite small and no drawer space. Pool is also more of a plunge pool than pool. Only real criticism is that the WiFi is rubbish - got better connection in local restaurants & attractions. Couldnât upload trip advisor etc which was challenging when planning. But staff helpful and printed tickets off for us etc. Would go back.;4
I booked my stay with 25,000 reward points and boy was I surprised when I checked in and saw the tiny room. No joke, you had to step into the shower in order to close the bathroom door. If left open, you had to reach around the door to get toilet paper. The room had to be 60 square feet, if that. The bed was very, very  comfortable. The walls were nicely decorated.  No ice bucket in the room, but room service brought it up. There was a fresh rosebud in a vase. The coffee in the room was NOT free.  It was about 9:30 when we checked in and crowds of people were headed for the nightclub, yet the room was quiet. All in all, I'd say it was a nice hotel, just steps from Lincoln Center. Just don't let them stick you in a room ending in 41. I really think it must have been a utility;4
The location of this hotel is great no question as was the rate paid compared to other hotels. The bedroom and bathrooms have been recently updated and it shows.  Clean, modern, comfortable...however....there is no getting away from the noise of the external fans outside my room 814 or the air-con noise. But the hotel does provide earplugs and they did the trick. All in all no regrets in picking this hotel.;4
"The location was perfect, whether or not you're visiting Universal Studios. Room was decent and clean. The pool area had zero clean towels and although we requested a ""room refresh"", we never received one. Therefore, we had to call several times to get more towels, coffee, etc. Parking is also pricey at $30 a day, but that seems standard in the area. Staff was overall friendly.";4
Many people stay here to visit Universal Studio, but I stayed here while visiting LA downtown area.   Positives : A reasonable price for hotel in one of the biggest landmark. Good location because highway is only 1 block away. only 15 minutes to LA downtown. There's Sheraton right next to this Hilton, and I liked Hilton better. (I feel building is little more new, and clean)  Negatives :  I had to wait 20 minutes at check-in, with only 5 people in line. Three Front Lobby staffs were little slower(or slow computer?)   Hotel is Crowded with many international travelers, and night partiers.  Again, never try to deal directly with loud guests at 1am. Gently call lobby, and inform them you are having problem sleeping. they will send security, and may give you bonus points for;4
Great interior decoration.  Staff always friendly and accomodating.  Rooms were small, but had free wifi, TV - plenty of storage space.  The lift was such that it was generally far faster to take the stairs.  One negative was the noise from the road and draughty windows.  Over enthusiastic heating and freezing outside conditions made for a variable room temperature.  Never had to wait for a shower (great water pressure).  They now give free flipflops and a dressing gown.  Will stay here again.;4
Hi, please contact me if you would like to know more about woogo appt in Central Park. All i will say is that we stayed in room 1601 (last but one to top floor), great room, clean, not that big but had just cozy feel, queen bed (comfortable), cooking area, fridge / freezer, air con (worked well ), microwave, iron / board, cable tv, plenty storage space, good sized bathroom. Woogo located in excellent position in NY, west side but close to subway (one stop from times square by express train 2 or 3), supermarkets, good restaurants (try Mikes Bistro, Citrus, both walking distance), central park (go to Tavern on Green in central park for most amazing restaurant, pricey but cool garden to sit in). Staff in Woogo are helpful and will readily deal with questions and problems. Sheets;4
"We've been here for 4 nights (16-20 May); and we've had a really great time... Room (803) was quite large for 2 people, and we also had 2 single beds with the same price of a double room (584 euro). Toilet was clean and towels were always fresh! The room was deadly quiet, and all the staff was very friendly, and has always gave us a hand!!! There are 2 subway station nearby, but no good restaurants... Anyway, i would stay there for my next trip in NYC!!! A great little hotel!!!";4
For travelers who look for hotels that focus and excel at the core facets of a stay, look no further.   Pros Quiet room Excellent bathroom and amenities Comfortable bed  Respectful housekeeping staff  Cons AC is loud Room charges could be more friendly  If you are a visitor who is using the hotel to have a dead quiet sleep, look for excellent shower quality and bathroom amenities, then return to find a perfectly cleaned room, Ameritania cannot be beat at this price point.;4
We recently stayed at the Empire and in our departure we left behind some medical equipment that I use for sled apnea.  We contacted the hotel and were placed in touch with Security and Mr. Bernard Obas.  Mr. Obas was very prompt in seeing that this equipment was located and returned to me.  In fact, I received the package just a day or two after my request went out.  I was very thankful for his efficiency.  This was our second stay at the Empire Hotel and mostly it is a fine getaway hotel on the West Side, close to Lincoln Center, Time Warner and Central Park.  It is modestly priced and the rooms, although not huge, are adequate and commensurate with the cost and are quiet and clean.  The room is well stocked with almost everything you can need (including an iPhone 5 adapter;4
Reserved this hotel for one night visit to Hollywood. Price is decent and rooms were clean. Most importantly the stay was quiet and peaceful in a potentially âhappeningâ area. The drawbacks: If you ask for a fold-up sofa for your kids prepare to pay $30. Also prepare to pay almost $20 for parking which I think is a ârip-offâ. Staff is kind of friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a plus for âbreakfast eatersâ. Location is definitely strategic if you are visiting Hollywood area. Oh, and if you are there in a âlowâ car, watch yourself as you are driving into the entrance area to check in (it is a bit steep). Oh, no bathtubs either, so for you ladies that want to take a bath, forget it :( Fridge and microwave were a plus :);4
This was our last stay of our holiday. We had 1 day at Universal studios & 1 day at Warner Bros so the location was ideal. The concierge was fantastic helping us organise our tickets to both venues and getting us early entry to Universal. The hotel room was just a typical Hilton room and dated however it was clean and the bed comfortable just what we needed when we came back each night exhausted. Breakfast was just average. The free shuttle bus that runs between universal, the Hilton and the Sheridan is great and saves your weary feet at the end of the day as well as walking in the heat. The highlight for us was the Warner Bros tour it really is great value for money - you get to see a real working studio - get to walk around sets and at the end can sit on the Friends couch on;4
Great Location, super close to subway and bus pick up.  Great restaurants very close to hotel.  Super friendly staff always willing to help.  Rooms are small but decor is very modern and bed is very comfortable.  Had small issue with waiting for a period of time to get hot water but other than that would stay there again in a heartbeat.;4
Other than being given the room key to a room that was still occupied, which was a very awkward experience, the hotel was fine. It was well kept in fairly new. It should be noted that parking is valet and very expensive at $60 a night. Thatâs a lot for any overnight parking.;4
This is my second time staying at Empire. First one was longer and for business. The staff is always friendly and competent. I've stayed almost two weeks total and never had one issue with service. Check In/Out is simple and rooftop bar/restaurant has a great view and value. Price is very reasonable. Location is perfect for anything NY not just Manhattan. $10-15 Uber ride to Penn St, which I took both times, lets you get anywhere in the city or state. If I had one small criticism, it would be that the rooms are a little older, but it's an older hotel/building and not that big of deal. Overall I love this place and combination of everything described would be hard to find.;4
"We usually stay at the Beverly Hills Hilton, but because of the Academy Awards, their prices were sky high.  There are two standouts at the Universal Hilton; one is outstanding service by all employees we came into contact with---from the greeting we received by the doormen to the desk, to the restaurant. The other standout is the sumptuous breakfast buffet. Whether you choose the entire buffet (including hot items) or the Continental---this buffet put the BEVERLY HILTON BREAKFAST BUFFET TO SHAME. I don't quite understand why the BHH has such a poor buffet. I've written about it previously. Although, for our purposes, Universal's location is not ideal, it is a lovely property.";4
The staff were outstanding in their service and friendliness. Location is perfect, across the street from Lincoln Center and Central Park,  great restaurants, and shops. Room was very clean and comfortable. Will defintely return to this hotel.;4
I went here for a business trip to defend the north 2019. overall I enjoyed my room, everything was fine except for the fact that there was no fridge in the room, which is a BASIC BASIC necessity. i had to keep getting ice and i brought food and drinks with me. other than that everything was fine.;4
Finally having made it to the Big Apple, my booking pointed me towards Morningside Inn for my budget.  The Location: New York City is BIG, and location is the biggest thing I can commend Morningside Inn for.  If one is flying into LaGuardia (and I don't envy you if you are) simply take the M60-SBS bus all the way to the end of its line.  The Broadway/106th stop is just around the corner.  There are several good chain restaurants and even Tom's Diner (Monks Cafe) from Seinfeld is three blocks north.  The Lobby and Staff: The reception is quite barebones.  The hotel is in a pre-war building, and you have to know the address as the sign for the hotel is hidden behind a tree on the front steps.  Some staff are more chipper than others.  Check-in time is at 2pm, strictly enforced but;4
"I read the reviews of this hotel only days before leaving on vacation, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found clean and very acceptable accomodations and not the ""Bates Motel Revisited"".  We travel quite a bit, and I'm particularly critical of hotels.  While the location was not exactly ""Hollywood"", it was only a short distance from Griffith Park.    We stayed three nights for the Rose Bowl, and the only night I heard any noise from the room whatsoever was New Years Eve.  Our room was on the second floor, and faced the courtyard.  The bathroom was very good sized, and the room was adequate (though the bed and pillows a bit hard like all hotels)  The staff was accomodating and quick, extra towels were brought up to the room within 20 minutes of calling the front desk.  The";4
Location is a bit of chinatown, lower east side and soho rolled into one.  Good location overall and plenty of subways nearby.  The hotel was quiet and the room was comfortable.  The room was clean and unlike other commenters, I found no evidence of bugs.  The guy at the front desk gave me some good recommendations for meals closeby.  I walked in the neighborhood late at night and had no concerns.  Given the price, location, and comfort level, I will definitely return here.;4
The price for the location of this hotel was fair. Other hotels were extremely overpriced. The front desk staff and doormen were extremely nice and helpful. The rooms were quaint, not too big and not too small, and clean.;4
Super convenient, away from traffic, and very comfortable. This place would be great if you are there for a quick business trip. It is away from touristy locations and it is very close to the airport.;4
After booking last minute then reading reviews we were nervous - however... Friendly helpful staff - particularly helpful when we were struggling to get covid tests results back to fly home. Everywhere was clean. We never waited more than a couple of minutes for the lifts. OK so the rooms are a bit basic and tired but it's the oldest hotel in new york- there's history here!! And seriously do you come to New York to stay in your room!!?? The location is perfect for a tourist visit.  We would definitely stay again and recommend;4
I booked this hotel at the last minute but when i arrived i was impressed. The room was clean and equipped with TV, iron, couch, towels etc. Located 2 or 3 blocks from central park and theres a subway station on 96th st which is 2 stops away from times sq. The hotel is surrounded by various food and convenient stores with most of them are 24hrs.;4
Ver convenient and within minutes of walking to Universal Studios and the street walk.  We loved the pool area and the staff is amazing.  Would have gave it 5 stars if the room prices were a little more affordable.  But it is very convenient to so many places within walking distance.;4
If you're looking to be right there in the heart of NYC, close to Broadway shows, Times Square, Central Park, Stephen Colbert show, Madison Ave, Empire State Building, luxury and mid level shopping, restaurants, bars, etc, then this is a wonderful hotel to stay. Despite all this action, and the complimentary ear plugs they provide, you really don't need them because it is not noisy and we slept wonderfully in their incredibly comfortable King size bed!  I would highly recommend requesting a room higher up, as they kindly upgraded our room on our second night to the 7th floor instead of the 2nd floor. The first room was not awful, but really no comparison to the size and view of the 7th floor room.  My only complaint was that they don't have free wifi, who doesn't have free wifi;4
Excellent location for walking to main attractions. Right by Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and Empire State Building. Excellent service at the hotel and a very nice room. Good restaurants near by.;4
Just checked into the Empire with Pasquale at the front desk.  He was so helpful and gracious.  The taxi I arrived in began rolling forward while I was trying to pull my heavy suitcase from the backseat!  My shoe was caught by the rolling tire and my right arm was wrenched.  I limped into the hotel.  Pasquale upgraded my room so that I could check in immediately, as I arrived before the 3:00 check in time.  The decor of the Empire is not to my taste but its location next door to Lincoln Center and its stellar staff keep me coming back;4
We stayed at the New Yorker over the Halloween period, and as it was our first trip to NYC we chose this hotel due to its location.   Situated directly opposite Madison Square Garden and on the same street (34th) as the Empire State building, the hotel is also only a few blocks walk from Times Square and not a million miles away from Central Park (visit the zoo if you get chance). If you wanted to visit the bottom of the island to see Wall St and see the 9/11 site, I recommend using the underground.  Check-in in and check-out of the hotel were fairly straightforward even though there was quite a queue we had to wait in.   The hotel itself was a bit dated in its decor and the rooms were small, but i suppose this is to be expected when visiting a city like New York where space is;4
Good central hotel, with booked parking a few minutes away. The London Eye, River cruise, Shrek, the dungeons, tube station very close by and easy 20 minutes walk to Drury Lane to watch âFrozenâ. Unfortunately, a bit noisy with drunks outside in the early hours of the morning, but not inside, so not the Premier Inns fault,;4
My daughter and I had four nights in The Empire & had a great time. Room was a bit small but clean & comfortable beds. All the staff were fab especially Eric from the rooftop bar. Hotel is in a great location and my daughter was given a complimentary bottle of wine for her birthday ~ lovely gesture! Would certainly use again in the future.;4
stayed here last NYE for 7 nights. The hotel in general was pretty stunning, our room was nice and had a amasing view however we paid for an upgrade for a delux and I didnt see what I paid extra for. House cleaning were fantastic with the room cleaned twice daily. It was great for a strole to central park with the south entrance just 30 mtrs away but its a little further from most other attractions, not a problem if you dont mind a walk. Everytime I encountered the staff I was left feeling they didn't care much for conversation or small talk and didn't come across as welcoming, possibly the reason for a 4/5 & not a 5/5! They ask for $100 a night deposit which I guess wouldn't be too bad if you were only staying a night or two, but considering we were staying 7 nights its a;4
Very nice, centrally located to many landmarks. The hotel is over 100 years old, but is restored and decorated in a Art Deco design.  The beds were firm but comfortable. Subway entrance is right by the hotel. The only negative thing is the size of the bathroom, it is cramped and there wasn't much of a counter to set things on. Also, it took over 10 minutes to get hot water in our bath tube.  It is a nice nostalgic old hotel and I would probably stay there again just for the location.;4
The rooftop bar is a bit of a seedy nightclub which brings an interesting crowd to the hotel, but the hotel rooms themselves are not disturbed by this. The room was spacious for NYC standards and the location was peaceful but walking distance to downtown. Close to good restaurants and Central Park. We booked two hotels for our stay and moved downtown for the second half of our stay in NYC, but we much preferred the location of the Empire. Would definitely stay again.;4
The Wyndham New Yorker was just across the road from Penn Station, so perfect for a short stay in New York when we travelled up by train from elsewhere in USA for a couple of days. The subway at Penn Station also proved really convenient and an excellent way to travel round New York. We were on the twenty-fifth floor with an excellent view. The room was a decent size and we slept really well on a firm, comfortable bed. The street noise was not a problem at all. The room was very clean, the staff were very helpful. The cost for a double room on Expedia was less than Â£100 a night, excellent for a city centre hotel in New York. The additional charge of 20% to the bill the next morning was a surprise because we did not use the gym or the printing facilities in their computer suite,;4
"This was my second stay at The Jane, and it was as good as i remembered. I stayed in room 361 (single cabin room) this time, which didn't have much of a view but was less than 20 paces to the bathroom. The staff were all very helpful, housekeeping was thorough and i must make a special mention of the bell-hop who went out of his way to help get me a cab when i left to go home. The elevator was out of action but not really a big deal. The towels are soft, bed comfy and the free wifi and in room safe are very useful.  The hotels in a great area, only a few minutes walk to the nearest subway (A,C,E & L lines) and with plenty of great eating, shopping and quiet parks within walking distance.   The only minor negative is the noise; i would recommend taking earplugs to help ensure a";4
The hotel is clean and charming. The hosts are really nice and you feel more than welcome. I will definetely go back again. Nice swimmingpool. Romantic little area with fountain and couches. The breakfast is included. When it comes to order food or call a taxi they taking good care of you.  Well located. You are at 10 minutes to hollywood boulevard.;4
We stayed and the Ameritania Times Square for a long weekend in Christmas season.  Could have pain twice as much easily elsewhere but why?  Comfortable sleeping room, friendly staff, cozy lobby with fireplace to sip coffee and read in the morning.  On Broadway, easy walk to Times Square.  We'd go again!;4
So far my stay has exceeded expectations. I was worried about some of the negative comments posted here regarding customer service, but the staff has been bending over backwards to accommodate. Thank you front desk, especially Jerry, Ganita, and Eugene!!!;4
Location excellent, small rooms, no free wifi in rooms, clean, nice and helpful staff. Overpriced. Hairdryer sparking, clean towels and linen, changed every day. Maybe include wifi in room rate. Ac working fine except for condensation. Overall ok stay;4
Have just returned from staying at the Empire for 14 nights. FANTASTIC LOCATION - near Central Park, near great places to eat, near subway, near Lincoln Center and near some good shops!! We found the hotel's staff very satisfactory. Hotel was kept very clean, but rather on the dark side. Dark furnishings and decoration, not exactly light and airy. Our room was a good size and clean.  The only down side to the room was the noisy air conditioning unit 24/7, noisy even when turned off. If we return to New York would stay here again.;4
Stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights In December.  The hotel has a beautiful lobby when you walk in.  Very art deco, it as also decked out for christmas which was lovely.  Check in was very easy,  We were not happy about their daily tax as coming from the UK we would not us the calls and we are centainly not fitness centre users!!  They agreed to reduce it down, which was good.  We also decided to pay for an upgrade to one of their recently refurbished Empire State Building View rooms.  We were so glad we did.  The room was on the 30th Floor and had the view was breathtaking.  We did not really have any interaction with the staff but they all seemed friendly enough.  The other plus of this hotel is the location, its very central and only a 10 min walk to times square and 5 mins;4
Whatever you do, do not accept a run of the house room!! We originally arrived and was placed in a nice looking but very warm room (and considering that this is Dec in NYC it was a little strange) but we proceeded to stay in the room... For the night!!! After a long 8 hour flight we settled down only to be woken up by what I can only describe as a trainers (or sneakers) in a tumble dryer sound. This kept us awake the whole night. However come morning the staff couldn't be more helpful. They discussed the issue with our agent and moved our room (albeit to a smoking floor room but that would have to do as it was over the Xmas and NYE period.) After that though we began to enjoy ourselves and could only then relax. The bar/ lounge area was very nicely kitted out and the staff there;4
It was conveniently located in Times Square. I also loved how it was within walking distance to Central Park. The hotel was safe and clean. The staff was very professional and helpful. My son stayed here on a school trip and I stayed here on a girls family getaway. Great experiences both times.;4
"I stayed here for 4 nights in June 2014 with my Mum, which we booked as a hotel+flight combo with an airline.  We had a room with two double beds and it was a good size with plenty of space around the beds and ample space for us both.  The bathroom was quite small but not cramped and had everything you need.  The room was cleaned to a high standard every day.  Our only issue was that the air conditioning was loud, but we got used to it. The roof-top bar was very nice although a bit lacking in shade; some umbrellas for the tables would be a good addition.  The pool would be great for cooling off, but a bit small for exercising in. As others have said, the concierge was fabulous and very helpful with great suggestions.  The location is also great.  Close the park and not far to";4
My hubby took me to NY early August, wow it was hot!  Stayed at Wyndham New Yorker. lovely Art Deco very clean/tidy and lovely staff!  Quite small rooms, we were on floor 26 and the view was of the opposite building - but let's be honest!/ how long are you in your room while in NY???  All in all it was lovely!  Staff were all very friendly and helpful;4
This hotel is a mile or two east of the main Hollywood attractions, but rooms & service more than make up for the location.  Also, the very nice Los Feliz district is a short walk to the north. Free breakfast is way above average.  Rooms are large and the TV and internet work perfectly.;4
I was in LA for four nights to take in a couple ball games and sights of the area.  The hotel is very convenient to the Metro Red Line of the LA mass transit system which provides connection to other Metro lines and Union Station.  The closest station is Vermont & Santa Monica, approximately 2 blocks south of the hotel.  Breakfast was way better than anticipated, with more or less a full breakfast every morning.    The room is a decent size for a single traveler or couple.  Be sure to request a room not on Vermont as it is quite loud and sirens pass by as it is a major street.  Bed was comfortable and everything worked as expected with regards to TV and internet.  The staff was courtesy and business like.  I am mostly self-sufficient, so I did not make any local inquiries.    I;4
The Empire Hotel as a nice surprise, just steps from Columbus Circle and at the head of Central Park. The rooms were clean and updated. Only complaint would be as with most older buildings in the city, there are not enough electrical outlets for today's demands, laptop computer, iPad, iPhone, etc. Had to choose one to charge, then alternate. No plug availabe near bedside table.;4
"Three of us staid in a studio for 4 nights - we were very skeptical after reading all the reviews and seriously contemplated changing our reservations to another place; but since we were only paying less than $100 US per night for this place, we figured we'll take our chances.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Granted, by no means is this place luxurious, but it was very adequate (just a bit of background, we have travelled around the world quite a bit, and have staid in everything from 5 star hotels to dark and dirty hostels).  The negatives first:  1) the sofa bed for the 3rd person was way too soft; 2) no bedding was provided for the sleeper sofa until we asked for it, and even then, the blankets they provided for the sofa weren't comfortable at all - it was more like a thick";4
Good points: value for money, excellent room, very friendly/helpful staff and manager, near central park.  Negative: distance from midtown/downtown, single lift, location seems safe, but would not recommend night walks too far away!  Not for those seeking and wishing/able to pay for swish hotel. If you just want a clean room at affordable price this is recommended.  Breakfast at the Lexquisitis, round the block (153 Manhattan Ave) Banana porridge is a must!  The manager seems keen to sell bus tours and arrange a cab back to airport. We agreed to the latter which was fine, but check with driver that the flat charge includes the toll price, before you get in. Tips are extra.  Subway station a 5min walk away. 103rd st. $7 fun day pass for unlimited travel. Taxis are not any faster,;4
I stayed 5 nights at the Empire Hotel ending with the Labor Day weekend. Over all it was a very nice stay - I had a small room in the interior, my friends had larger rooms with views but since we spend very little time in our rooms it did not make a big difference.  Staff was friendly - check in and out was quick and painless.  The location is wonderful - there are two subway stations close by and Central Park is just across the street.  Also coming from Europe I always wake up very early and go for a walk - it's a nice area for a morning constitutional and Starbucks right on the corner open at 5.30 am.  The only two down sides I can find is the very noisy air condition - if I turned mine off the unites around me were still very noticable - and the fact that the hotel does not;4
Nice hotel close to Universal Studios with walking distance, but there are shuttle busses as well also for handicap/wheel shares.  Nice hotel, with nice bar, restaurant, etc.  We had our most expensive breakfast ever at this hotel buffÃ© with nearly 40 dollar per person incl. normal tips.  If you go to Universal Studios buy express pass to all prior to your visit on internet (sheeper) or in the lobby (more expensive) at the hotel in high seasons, which gives you one express entrÃ© to each attraction once.;4
I'm a former NYC resident and I visit the NYC area fairly often. I stayed here twice: In January 2010 and January 2011. I paid under $50.00 both times and liked it better than the $50.00 to $60.00 rooms that I had been renting at Howard Johnsons in New Jersey (Clifton, Parsippany). The staff was much more courteous. They personally showed me to my room when I couldn't find it and helped me when I had trouble with my key, staying until they were sure I got it. No one looked down their noses at me like the staff at more than one Howard Johnson (I've been told that I can pass for late teens/early 20s), I didn't overhear any maids screaming at families with young children to hurry up and check out a good 10 to 15 minutes before they needed to and none of the staff came into my room;4
Hubby booked a last minute trip to NY. We were offered the New Yorker. When we arrived the gave us an upgrade when hubby asked if we were in the referbed  part. We were on the 50th floor . The room was small but nicely done out. It was only to sleep in and store shopping bought. Beds were very comfy and clean towels were there every day. The Hotel is perfect for Madison Square Garden, diagonally  opposite.  Empire State building is a few blocks up,  Macys is just next block up and Times square is near and the High line walkway just behind the hotel. Tick tick diner adjoined to Hotel is a fab place to eat too.;4
Great location close to everything. Walk to Macyâs, Town Square, the Empire State Building. We had a room with two beds, two dressers, two chairs, and 2 closets which made it very convenient. The only complaint was the small bathroom.  Great security, very clean, and helpful staff. They have 3 eating options, and a gym.;4
Nice hotel in a good location, with restaurants attached, centrally located in easy walking distance to the Empire and Time Square.  The bedroom was a good size, however the bathroom was small and looks like the original 1920's fittings.  On leaving we wanted to leave our suitcases for a few hours and was charged $20 ($5 per item) but would use it again.;4
Visited the Universal City Hilton on 16th October for 4 nights. We found the hotel to be of a good standard and very helpful staff. A special mention to Maria who looked after us really well on the Saturday evening, even though the dining areas were really busy due to the buffet night. Our daughter is a fussy eater and she made sure her tastes were accommodated! Ideal location for Universal studios and a great little courtesy bus to take you to the Citywalk if required.  Rooms comfortable and breakfast was very good but a bit pricey!  Easy access to Metro to get you around in LA.;4
Firstly the hotel was very clean and well kept including the rooms. The front desk staff were very helpful in giving us tips for getting around the city and also getting us a transfer back to the airport. The standard rooms are a bit dated and basic but are absolutely fine for a short stay or if you are out for most of the time and just need somewhere to rest. The cleaners come in every day and do a good job. Iâd definitely recommend if you need a short stay hotel for a few days in NYC.;4
"Just came back home from a 3-night staycation from Fri through Mon for the 12/1/17 - 12/4/17 weekend in order to do Universal Studios/Wizarding World of Harry Potter and ""Hamilton"" at the Pantages. Enjoyed our stay and appreciated the great customer service from staff there. Appreciated how helpful and nice Linda was during our check-in on Friday around 2pm (room was ready, Yay!), giving us lots of helpful information and sending a nice anniversary surprise for our room (chocolate dipped strawberries and champagne). Linda also helped accommodate our late check-out request for 2pm on Monday. We are Hilton Honors Gold so had 2 complimentary continental breakfasts that we could upgrade to the breakfast buffet for additional $10 each, which was worth it for the variety of options";4
The Empire Hotel is a charming, boutique style hotel.  The lobby bar is intimate and has a sexy feel to it. Just a mere 5 minute walk to Central Park. The rooftop bar is fantastic. The rooms are unique, but a tad on the smaller side.  However realize it is NYC. All in all, would recommend staying at this hotel.;4
The location of this hotel for visiting Universal studios is excellent, maybe a 5 minute walk, which is easy, or take the free shuttle. The interior lobby is pleasant and they have a nice water refill station. We had a room with 2 queen beds for 4, so we got a roll away for our teenage daughter. It was nice but not really much room in the room for the extra bed and 4 cases. Not very easy to manage all the cases in the room provided. The rooms were very clean and a nice bathroom, the view was great and the kids loved the pool. We enjoyed sitting by the pool with refreshments from the bar there. All in all a very nice hotel, just be aware there is nowhere close like a 7/11 so you are fairly captive to the prices of the hotel and the nearby City Walk if you don't bring in your own;4
My second stay at the Empire and love the location, close to Central Park and Columbus Circle. Be sure to request a room with a view and not the interior rooms, they feel like a cave. Friendly staff and helpful bellman out front. Overall good hotel!;4
I recently booked this room through Expedia - it was one of those hidden hotel deals.  After booking the room and getting thename of the hotel I cam to trip advisor to read the reviews.  I was so nervous! Everyone was complaining about how small the rooms were, that there were robberies, the air conditioner unit was loud, and that the shower flooded.  I also noticed that the General Manager had reached out to everyone who wrote reviews on here.  To me that's great service.  I actually took the liberty of calling to let them know I was skeptical, and she assured me that we had nothing to worry about and was offered an upgraded room.  I would like to break this down for you as simple as possible:  1. It is a 4-5 Star hotel...which means the rooms are going to be smaller!  The;4
"Good place to stay near Central Park.  From reading other reviews here, I think we had an excellent room, which was a complimentary upgrade from the standard double I had booked. (Thank you, Don). We had a 3rd floor corner room, which was surprisingly large for NY, with a view of Lincoln Center.  We booked the ""splash"" package on their website, which gave us 2 drinks in the bar, and 2 breakfasts for about $30 more, a good deal for this area.  The downsides were that it took me 3 trips to the front desk to obtain all the vouchers necessary for this package, and that the air conditioning in the room had a hard time keeping up with the 90 degree heat.  Had it going full blast the entire time & temperature was just tolerable.";4
We have just returned from five days stay at this hotel which we found to be wonderful. We were able to get around really well and see all the major sights from this hotel via the excellent metro system which is just a block away. The hotel is very clean and rooms spacious with a fridge, microwave , iron and ironing board. The reception staff were excellent and very helpful. Giving us a lot of useful information. The breakfast is particularly good especially the waffles. It really set us up for the busy day ahead. The only down side is that if you want night life or restaurants, there is nothing nearby although it didn't bother us as we stayed out most of the day and were just ready for fast food take out and our beds.;4
"I stayed at the Empire on business. I enjoyed the stay. Everyone was courteous and helpful. The roof bar was fun, PJ Clark's was a very good restaurant (not part of the hotel but in the same building). The room was quite clean and appeared to be renovated. I upgraded to a deluxe and was glad I did. I saw a regular room and it was MUCH smaller.  My room faced Lincoln Center's courtyard/fountain and I was serenaded by a jazz group  that performed there one afternoon. Saw and heard them perfectly. (Room 816).  Cons: the safe didn't work very well in the room (probably that one safe malfunctioning). Room service has a very limited selection and limited hours (and virtually no ""healthy food""), and I could hear the traffic on the street. The bathrooms are small, but very functional.";4
Close proximity to Lincoln center and Central Park makes this Hotel a premium property. Columbus circle subway station is close by. We had a wonderful time in NYC because of Empire hotel's location. Room was comfy and clean but poorly lit.  Staff was helpful. For my future NY stay, Empire Hotel will be a top consideration.;4
The hotel itself was cute and charming. It had that old Hollywood appeal. The staff was very nice and accomadting. I didn't like the area around it though. There was a lot of homeless people on the sidewalks so i didn't feel that safe walking outside but inside I felt safe.;4
Stayed one night at Midtown West Hotel. Room was small but clean and quiet. Had a good nights sleep. Friendly staff including Jose and Tyriek. Good location. Had some concerns after reading some of the reviews but had good stay and would stay again!;4
Good hotel in a great location close to subway and within walking distance to a lot of New Yorkâs attractions. Good size room with large bed and large shower room. We didnât pay the $18 plus tax per person for breakfast as there is a deli at the end of the street which is nice and cheap. Will definitely go back next time in New York;4
We booked this hotel most based on the price and we weren't dissapointed.  The room was spacious and bright and the bathroom was huge!  The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the metro tube station and it's really easy to navigate.  The courtyard area is lovely and it's a real shame the hotel don't do more to utilise it.   The breakfast options were great but it would be nice if they served food on an evening.  We'd definitely stay here again.;4
Our check in was fast and easy.  We reserved a king bed but were upgraded to 2 fulls.  The room and bathroom were clean and well maintained.   Location was excellent.   Easy walk to Central Park, Columbus Circle, shopping, Times Square and the NYC ballet is right across the street.  Would be happy to stay here again.;4
The Hollywood hotel is (unsurprisingly) well located for Hollywood and Universal Studios. It is 200 metres from the Vermont/Santa Monica Metro station which in turn is a few stops and about 15 minutes from universal. The hotel is not the most modern, however rooms are clean, well appointed and of a satisfactory standard. Flat screen TV with plenty of channels, a safe and coffee machine are provided in all rooms. The hotel has a swimming pool available to guests although we didn't use it. Breakfast is included whilst is a real bonus in Hollywood. The breakfast is buffet style, well presented and wholesome. We found the reception staff cheerful and informative. Cinthya was informative and most helpful in assisting us navigate the city. We were four adults so a taxi to the airport;4
The Empire Hotel has excellent location in the upper Westside of Manhattan.  Unfortunately free wifi is only available in the Lobby area. Not good enough for the room rates charged.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the two rooms I used were very large.;4
I stayed here for 2 nights over 2 visits and this report is the culmination of both. The first visit, check in was a bit rushed and I was not told all the detail for my Globalist (such as happy hour) yet the second check in described everything in great detail which was awesome. I was upgraded both times to a runway view high floor and the rooms were great. Quite large with a sofa next to the window, there was plenty of closet space and plugs. My first room was on the 12th floor and I actually heard a lot of noise from the gym  above - people dropping weights on the floor reverberated through the ceiling. However my second room on the 10th floor was super quiet despite it being NYE.   The shower pressure is OK - not great but the bathroom had everything you would need. The room;4
Terrific hotel in a great location for Universal Studios.  Generally the hotel could not be faulted. Would definitely stay again.;4
We visited to celebrate my partners 40th birthday and found this hotel which is just two blocks from Times Square- so a great location for tourists. The hotel is smart, clean with modern decor, the rooms are a good size and despite its central location they are quiet and heavy curtains keep the light out. We found the staff very responsive to queries, providing a kettle to our room quickly upon request and even dropping a small cake and birthday note to my partner into our room. There is also tea and coffee in the foyer for a lot of the day. Iâd definitely recommend it, well priced for central New York;4
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel on Vermont st for a few nights and were pleasantly happy with our visit. We got a great rate for our room , it was very basic but clean with a nice view of the courtyard. This is the perfect place to stay if you want a cozy and private hotel. The free breakfast was great and chef Hugo couldn't have been nicer and so pleasant. Also every time I went to the front desk, I was greeted by Gisel and her friendly smile. She was so helpful and upbeat, made us happy to be there! Overall a great experience.;4
Nice hotel with very pleasant service. Well located near Sunset, Santa Monica and Hollywood Boulevard. Excellent breakfast for american circumstances. Nice pool area.  Only the parking fee (24 dollars a day) is much too high!;4
It has been said that everywhere in LA takes 20 minutes.... And this is true for this hotel! It is quite central and it's easy to get everywhere you need to with a car. Parking prices are a bit of a drag but it's LA after all. We stayed here for a week and a half and the hotel was very accommodating to us and met all our needs. Housekeeping it a bit funny with cleaning times but it's a clean place with good facilities. The breakfast is good too :);4
Astor on the Park is extremely basic, but what more can you expect from the price!  For what we paid, we couldnt expect any more.  The first room we were given was tiny - there was literally a foot of space surrounding the bed!!  you could touch both walls at the same time.. However we asked to move and this was done swiftly and with no complications.  The second room had 2 double beds and therefore was larger, but proportionately it was the same.  The room was fully equipped with a wardrobe, drawers, a small but spotlessly clean bathroom with a ledge for toiletries, plug sockets, tv, alarm/radio and phone.  Each day the room was cleaned to a very high standard (and my standards are high!!) and clean towels were provided.  Yes, Astor on the Park is small and basic, but in NY you;4
The hotel was very clean, however it was very difficult to figure out how to turn things on in our room. The decor was ultra modern and was not attractive. Our toilet made a horrendous noise when it was flushed, A lightbulb was burned out in the light next to the bed, and it was hard to figure out how to turn the individual lights on in the room. There is a key that goes in a slot when you come in the room that turns the power on in the room so that the air and all the lights will come on. There were no instructions on how to operate the TV. That said, when we called there was somebody that came up immediately and fixed the toilet and showed us how to operate the lights. The little cafÃ© in the hotel was very good and we enjoyed our pizza and salad. The lady that made the pizza;4
Great location and beautiful hotel.   Clean rooms and very nice staff.  Don't pay for the in room WiFi, it doesn't hold a connection.  Lobby and hallways were always very clean and well kept.  We will visit again!;4
Very clean. Quiet. Old, but charming and very well maintained. Feels safe. Nice alarm clock with two USB connections and two grounded outlets for chargers, C-PAPs, etc.  Good access to touristy locations near midtown. Good casual 24 hour restaurant in lobby. Friendly staff. We were happy we made this selection.  Two minor things. Toilet was very low and close to side wall. And, gotta get past hard-sell of Wyndham property memberships to get to elevators to your room.;4
we just spend 5 nights at the New Yorker and were pleased at how central it was for us. We were able to walk to many of the sights (or take the hop - on hop off) that has a stops 3 blocks away Security was reasonable and I always felt safe;4
We where exceptic about the hotel, booking it online was a guess. We had a good time, price was good. We enjoy breakfast, Hugo the first day and a nice lady our second day made our eggs delicious.  We use the internet and was a good service.  The hotel was a good place to stay.  Thanks.;4
After booking this hotel and then looking at the reciews, I was a bit nervous about arriving.  We arrived after a long flight and nearly as long journey from the airport (don't book a shared cab as we were the last stop after battling rush hour traffic!).  The staff were friendly and welcoming.  While the room we had was at the back of the hotel, so no view, the room was clean and we were surprised at how quiet it was!  As we were tired after the trip the receptionist ordered us a pizza which was delivered straight to our room. Although you are a bit out of the centre, being able to cross the road straight into central park for a jog or walk was wonderful.  There is a small cafe just on the corner of where the hotel is for breakfast pancakes or bagles.  As there are 2 subway;4
The coffeeshop in the lobby ! outrageous pricing ie. Half a bottle of ordinary white californian wine 42$!! In California ! A can of Corona $7 and a pepsi$3The rooms are nice and spacey and wellequipped with Starbucks coffee and a hugh TV screen A warmed pool outside;4
We stayed in the smallest bunk rooms, so expected a small space. And a small space is definitely what we got! Main issue was the fact that the heating was on full blast, so we had to keep the window open. Didn't appear that we could change this ourselves. In such a small room, it felt like we were staying in a Swedish sauna.   Despite this, I've still given the hotel 4/5 stars and this is because the facilities were excellent, the staff were really friendly and helpful, and the hotel was in a superb location  - so easy to walk or travel into central Manhattan.   My favourite thing about the hotel was the atmosphere - it had a real Grand Budapest Hotel feel to it, and it felt like I was staying somewhere really special and unique.  If I were ever to return to NYC, I'd stay here;4
Really nice newly renovated property near Universal Studios.  We were there for a meeting, so we didn't go to Universal but it felt like it would be walking distance.  Rooms were nice, and I had a fantastic view of Hogwarts.  There was a Wax version of Robert Pattinson in the lobby, so that was fun.  Service was good.  All the king bedded rooms have a queen sleeper sofa, which is great for families.  Food was really expensive!  Good enough, but yikes.  I'd stay here again.    We took the train to Burbank airport and it was a $10.00 LYFT from there to the hotel.  Great way to get there, or flying into Burbank.;4
I have just returned from a 4 night visiti to NYC, Manhatten where I have stayed in the Empire Hotel. As I have previously visited NYC I was aware of the restaurant and club within the Empire which was my reasoning for booking this.   I can confirm having stayed in other hotels this is my favorite to date, the location was perfect. I had previously emailed ahead of arrival and was pleasantly suprised to arrive to an upgraded room. On the 2nd night in the hotel I was given a complimentary bottle of wine as they were aware of the celebration. The room was spacious and kept clean throughout our stay with fresh towels, sheets, bathroom amenities etc.  The reception were really helpful and the doorman could not do enough to help with taxis and directions.   This hotel again was the;4
Although a little pricey, very nice rooms, pool and restaurants. The location is great, especially if you have a car, and it's walking distance from universal studios, and universal city plaza, which can get really busy even with the locals on Friday and Saturday nights. It's also a short walk to the subway line, but we did the LA thing and drove to all our destinations on those horrid thousand-lane eternally clogged freeways. We enjoyed or stay and would certainly return If we're back in LA;4
This hotel sits high above Universal Hollywood Studios. We drove up to the valet parking area (valet parking is a pricey $22/day but self parking is not much better at $17/day) walked into the beautiful lobby area and proceeded up to our rooms even though we were a few hours earlier than check in time. We had booked two rooms. The couple in the other room noticed a stain on their sheets. Housekeeping immediately changed the bedding and the management send up two complimentary fruit baskets. The best thing about this hotel is it's convenience to Universal Studios and Citywalk. There is a shuttle, but you can also easily walk to the park within 10 minutes. The rooms were quite comfortable. The views were incredible of both the park and the hollywood hills area. There's a secluded;4
Great location, vibey lounge playing good music, with  a popular roof top bar upstairs.  I enjoyed my stay. Next door is the jazz lounge at Lincoln Centre. The hotel is close to everything as well incl whole foods.;4
PROS: - The room was clean  - A few mins walk to Hammersmith Metro/Bus station, so good location (one of the main reasons for selecting it) - Quiet as it is located on a side street - Good value for money  CONS: - Tiny room with thin walls & very small bathroom -;4
"We enjoyed our stay here.  The pros: The location was wonderful; out of the hustle bustle of major crowds, but still close to plenty of activities (lincoln center, columbus circle, central park) and very convenient to a metro station for quick access to the rest of the city. The staff was super friendly and helpful - everyone we encountered was cheerful and kind.  The lobby is lovely and both the lobby bar and the roof top bar were fun. Loved that there was a coffee shop and a drug store around the corner.  The cons: The rooms are small and show a little wear. The very small bathroom was a little problematic when I was trying to do my make up and hair as there was quite literally zero counter space in our bathroom. And I wished for some closet space to stash our stuff out of the";4
"I stayed at the Century City Hilton and overall it was a great experience. Although they were shortstaffed at the check-in counter, they were accomodating and apologetic. Make sure to leave before check-out; the elevators get cramped with folks!";4
This is my second stay in 12 months at this wonderful hotel which is perfectly located a short walk to Penn Station which means transport around the city and to/from the airport is optimal. The rooms are a little outdated and small (standard for NYC) however when visiting NYC I want to experience the sights and sounds of the city and therefore donât spend much time in my room. However what I do want is a clean, safe and well located property where the staff are friendly and helpful. I also want good options in terms of food/drinks and nearby stores. The New Yorker certainly ticks those boxes. The hotel staff prior to my visit (especially Emily R) were also very accommodating and helpful. I look forward to my next trip! Thank you!;4
Days Inn Hotel New York Broadway was once grander: notice the checkers marble lobby, where boorish tourists now straddle the couches, and the polished brass mail chute, the internet of its day, which is now largely ignored. A shadow of its former grand as it may be, the hotel offers a convenient midtown location and surprisingly roomy accommodations. Service was an expected from such establishment, sleep was average due to street noise, but at $160 a night (after AAA discount and including decent internet signal), it was a bargain. And the mail we sent from the chute made it all the way across the oceans.;4
A friend and I stayed at the Empire Hotel for the first time and enjoyed the comfortable beds and perfect and safe location for the purpose of our trip. Proximity to Central Park, eateries, the Lincoln Center. Walking distance (15 min) to MOMA and shopping made it a perfect choice for us. The staff was helpful and friendly and mostly responsive to our requests. Bathroom lighting was passable, room pleasant and clean. Would stay here again.;4
HUGO-the valet was very helpful. This location the valet is very key for guests. Front desk clerk was not friendly and only gave us bottles of water on day 2, because 1/2 room keys didnât work-not at check in .;4
I am currently in the middle of a 10 night stay & am really enjoying myself. Service has been awesome since check in. Houskeeping, gift shop, restaurant staff have all been super friendly & accommodating. Special shout out to Ali on the front desk who has walked me through a few technology problems with patience & a smile. Thanks again. Breakfast is complete. Everything you could want. Even have fun cereal for the kids in us. Breakfast chef is top class. Good size rooms which are nice but not modern. Great location right across from the metro. 35 to 45 mins from LAX airport. Would recommend  for families, couples, groups or solo.;4
LAX in general sucks (even without all the construction). I hope I never have to fly in/out of it again. Now thw hotel is a different story. What an awesome place. lobby a the way to the room was exceptional!;4
Nice place, nice Location, nice people work there. Front desk help with daily trips, we have always clean towels, at night you can sleep well the street is quiet. Metro station is Å minutes walk and food market is on the corner. great to stay there;4
The hotel was in a fantastic location! We would definitely go again based on location alone. The hotel is historic, which is nice. The bathroom inside our room felt quite dated and small however, the size of the room itself was great and we were happy with the view. We really canât find any faults and would recommend staying there!;4
We stayed at the Abercorn hostel for four nights and it was exactly what we needed : a cheap place to sleep. The hostel was really clean and the bed comfortable enough to get a good night of sleep. The best thing about this place is that it's a 2 minute walk from a metro station that connects three important lines. The only thing is that people are a little loud at night during the weekend (hey, who can blame them, they're on vacation after all!), so if you need complete silence to sleep, I would bring ear plugs. Over all, a good place to rest after a long day of sightseeing.We were happy with our choice.;4
Tiny, noisy rooms and shared bathrooms but still worth it for the West Village location and the very, very relative value. But especially for the fantastic cafe and its brunches. Style overcomes all else.;4
Stayed 4 nights in a basic room on holiday. Great location, great staff (front desk and info/security - concierge could use some work). Really enjoyed our stay. Lovely, beautifully redone hotel. Small rooms as most are in these big cities. Very clean, great atmosphere. Would absolutely come again.;4
Only missing free WiFi to get a five. I enjoyed my stay very much but when traveling on business you don't use the hotel facilities much.  I did use the free WiFi in the lobby but would have been far better to have that in the room.  WiFi should not be a paid service any longer. There was noise from the aircon that could bother others,  did not bother my sleep.;4
Very nice hotel, 5 minutes walk within central park, metro line and busses. The hotel has neatly and spacious rooms, but different temperatures on different floors.  Futheron the whole hotel service was good !;4
A fantastic location, right in the heart of Universal City, just make sure they are not testing the alarm systems or cutting power (this is an exception, not something they do on a regular basis) we were informed upon check in (too late to make changes to reservations!) also informed of elevator upgrades *they did a great job of assisting people with placing elevator operators (for lack of a better term) at the lobby floor. All in all a very nice stay, the hotel is being upgraded;4
My overall impression is that this hotel was just okay, and perhaps a bit disappointing. I was hoping for a little more special experience given the price of the rooms and 4-star rating. My mom and I stayed here for a week, and my friend joined us for a portion of those nights. The location is extremely convenient--near Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Port Authority, Duane Reade and CVS, Macyâs, Times Square and many food options--Tick Tock Diner (24 hours) in the corner of the hotel, fast food options across the street, healthier options a block or 2 further, and convenience stores with fresh fruit and salad/hot buffets as well. Preferring healthy food, I found a vegan restaurant (Cinnamon Snail) in the Pennsy food court at Madison Square Garden about 3 blocks away. The;4
Hi, Days Inn is one of the best value for the money I know in NYC. For whom Upper West Side is an acceptable location and does not look for a fancy place, this hotel is a good compromise. It is a bit old and the Internet in the room does not always work.... but the rooms are relatively quiet and large, and the price is very attractive. Also, the staff is very helpful (especially Melissa at teh front desk).;4
Days Hotel is close to where we visit our family on the upper west side. We have stayed here three times now. We are fans. It is probably not the first time visitor. But if you are comfortable with the subway system, it is so convenient. The 2-3 express trains across the street can have you in Times Square, Chelsea or other destinations in no time at all. Central Park is an easy walk and this stretch of the park is very nice and not as crowded. One block up is Pio Pio, a very reasonable Peruvian Restaurant with excellent chicken. This is a good neighborhood to just walk around in. The hotel is nice, not fancy, but solid. The elevators are clunky but not a dealbreaker. The staff is friendly. And considering the room rate often being well below the New York average, it makes it an;4
"The place is very good situated. You have direct connection to the subway, where all the main lines stop. The room was clean and quite. The staff was friendly and the sourrounding area was safe. The price was too high, but to this time was the New York Marathon, where all other prices were high as well. Close to the appartement is a store called ""Trader Joe"" where you can find your food for a good price. Dont expect, that the stuff is cleaning your room every day, but our room was clean and everything worked well.";4
Stayed here two nights with my partner. Small comfortable rooms, nice bathroom and good ish location in upper manhattan. Times square is walking distance etc. The staff were friendly and let us check in early. Would stay again.;4
This well maintained hotel is very convenient for the airport and has frequent free shuttles. Check in and check out were efficient. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lifts were quick. Bedrooms are large, comfortable and quiet. Shower pressure adequate but not great. Coffee machine, fridge, large TV, free WiFi and one of the best hotel bedroom irons I have used. Very reasonable for $75 + 6,000 pts. Recommended.;4
Besides them addressing my 4 year old about his age at the breakfast room, not only the host did it but the waitress did too, which i thought was very wrong of them. Not only did they basically assume i was lying. but it made me and the wife uncomfortable. I know there was a few other things that i didn't like. but overall stay was spectacular..;4
i stayed with my husband, niece, nephew, and brother over the 4th of july weekend,  the hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance to just about everything.  we didn't experience any elevator problems although we met some people who did.  the hotel is very clean and the staff very helpful.  used the concierge service to book a car to pick us up from newark airport and bring us to he hotel and from hotel to airport, very efficient although the car to the airport had used coffee cups in it.  chris, the concierge was very helpful and returned my phone calls almost immediately. all in all a very pleasant experience!!;4
Stayed here December 2013 just reviewing now the hotel when we stayed it wasn't wyndham it was just the new yorker. The hotel is very clean very close to empire state building. It's location literally across the street from Penn Station is very convenient.  Quite a small bathroom we had a queen room the rooms are not very big but clean and comfortable and who goes to NYC to sit in the hotel room so for us this hotel was great,;4
The location of the hotel was just perfect for coming in Los Angeles in winter, and we paid arround 1500 USD (taxes included)for 12 nights, the price was fair too.  The hotel is clean and quiet in general (depends of the fellow travelers) and they have very nice terraces and garden and the pool looks amazing too. It's not a luxurious hotel but a low cost awesome place to feel the spirit of L.A., if you are lucky to catch a good offer . The staff is super friendly and attentive and i really mean it, from the Filipino parking lady to the handyman, they are all smiling and helpful. Special thanks (gracias) to Gisel, she is amazing! I will definetly miss the breakfast omlets made by Hugo and Julio, also their pancakes.  The most disturbing thing is the price of the parking: 24 usd;4
Great hotel, super convenient and easy walk to and from the airport.  From or to the terminal furthest from the hotel, the walk is 20 minutes max.  Very Safe Environment.  Rooms are large, beds are fantastic.;4
Just completed a couple night stay at The Empire Hotel, I liked it and would stay again. It is in a great location right by Lincoln Center on Upper West Side, easy to and from Newark Airport especially. Room was comfortable, clean and good shower. Nice little bar in the lobby and Frank a terrific barman. Also the rooftop bar is worth a try too.  Some good places to eat very close by as well.;4
My family and I just returned from a trip to NYC and a stay at the Ameritania. It was a great location, central to so many things. It was clean and simple but it had everything we needed as we weren't in the room much. The staff was efficient and helpful. Jeff was especially kind. As soon as we arrived, he put our bags in storage until it was our check in time so we could get going without wasting a minute. He grabbed a map for us and laid out the city, giving us helpful tips and answered our questions. He arranged for our taxi to pick us up to head back to the airport when we left and made sure we were all set. I would recommend staying here if you want to be right in the middle of all the action.;4
Good location, some of the main attractions are a few meters away.  Good attention.  Clean rooms and friendly staff.  I liked the design, the painting and its bar. At the bar we had the attention of a bartender who spoke in our language, Spanish. He made the night very enjoyable.;4
We spent 4 nights at this hotel and were really enjoyed having this as a base.  It started off being a fair distance for us from LAX (esp on public transport!), but we were glad upon arrival to see the lovely views from our spacious corner Alcove room, and how well maintained the hotel was generally.  Check in was fairly smooth, and was glad to get some free wifi in the reception area (occasionally we got a connection all the way up in our room on the 15th floor). Room size was fantastic, with comfortable beds. The pool size was decent (although felt a bit cold at times) which made jumping into the hot tub even nicer! (was it just me, or was the hot tub a bit too hot at times?! lol)  The concierge staff were kind of helpful and happy to oblige with printed off maps from google,;4
I stayed here for business purposes - conference downtown - so whilst the rate was much cheaper than downtown  I spent a lot on taxis.  That said if you want to be close to universal city it's a perfect location.  The hotel itself is not new but the rooms are decent and clean - I had a corner room so was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  I didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that but all the staff i did interact with were friendly and helpful - I went out for a run one morning and they gave me a nice 3.5 mile route through a good neighbourhood.;4
Just stayed at the Ramada Inn Hollywood for a week over New Year. The staff were very nice and helpful after we had been let down by another hotel at the last minute. We were given a very large King room at a very good price, the room was very clean with a nice bathroom. Patio doors led onto a balcony overlooking a nice little courtyard with a fountain. The hotel is only 5 mins walk from the Metro station which was very useful for getting into downtown etc. The only negative is that they charged $9 a night to park in the car park with I don't think they should do for residents. Apart from that I can't fault it and recommend it.;4
The price of the hotel is good for a Manhattan hotel, the location is great just a few meters away from the subway station on 96th., and 3 blocks away from Central Park which is wonderful, the only problem i had was that I arrived at 1 am in the night and even then i had to wait for about 45 mins to get my room, the receptionist was very slow at doing the check-in at least with another guest, with me it didn't took so long. The rest of the experience was good, the room is ok, not the best but just ok for the price. The hotel is on renovation so i guess it will be even better later. Overall a good experience, since other hotels are very expensive there in Manhattan.;4
I have stayed at the Empire before but haven't for a few years, and upon a recent return for a work trip to New York I could not have been met with a nicer, more accommodating and helpful team, especially Maggie (thank you!) who went out of her way to help with some arrangements. The location is perfect - opposite Lincoln Center, near the Columbus Circle Metro, and two minutes from Central Park. Starbucks is just next door for the much-needed morning coffee fix. The room was spacious - especially for NYC - very well-appointed, quiet and extremely comfortable. Very good value for the money, which in Manhattan is not easy to come by.;4
Booked a double room with a view and was not disappointed. Magnificent  view of the Empire State building. The age and style of the hotel gave it a grand feeling but that also means its rooms aren't as big or pristine as a newer hotel.;4
Empire Hotel located right aside the Lincoln Center has an excellent location. Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, 1 Train Subway, Central Park and plenty of good quality variations of restaurants and food in the neighborhood. We found in an excellent place to have our hub while touring New York City for a week. Empire Hotel is very reasonably priced, large and clean rooms, and the service is excellent (in the few interactions we had to have), and I do especially mention Daria in the reception who advised us as NYC newbies. Thanks!;4
Had a couple of nights stay at the Hollywood Hotel. A pleasant atmosphere with friendly staff. Down the road there are numerous nice places to eat and drink.   Very close to the Metro.  Just a quick few stops to Universal Studios.  Enjoyed some cheap Mexican food at the outside eateries near the metro. Delicious! There is also a supermarket very close for anything you might need.  The rooms are clean and of a decent size. There is a nice courtyard to relax in and a gym and pool that were nice enough although I didn't get to use them.  As a travel agent, I will have no hesitation in recommending this property to my clients.;4
The hotel is in a great location, situated two blocks from Penn Station.  When we arrived the receptionist found us two good rooms with some lovely views of downtown. The room was compact but had everything we needed - we don't spend a huge amount of time in the bedroom as we are always out and about. The Tik Tok diner was our place of choice for breakfast and I chose something different every day. The lobby can be busy at times but we just met our parents there and then headed out. Rooms were quite quiet even thou we are on a busy street and the air con was a blessing on the warm evenings.;4
Excellent staff, well appointed rooms, good services, and a location that can't be beat.  I used to stay at another hotel in the area.  However, in two visits to The New Yorker I am now converted.  Great place.;4
Travelled solo in April 2017. For the price, you can't beat the location and amenities. 24 hours front desk with helpful staff. 8 minute walk to the Subway. Great restaurants, not to mention the Whitney museum and the Chelsea Market, close by. The hotel provides bikes to use to explore the neighborhood.  I stayed in a single room that was perfectly serviceable. The first night I was there it was very warm outside and the A/C made it comfortable to sleep. The shared washrooms were clean and I never had a problem with them being too busy. The Wi-Fi worked well. The locking mechanisms on the doors do make quite a bit of noise, and when people are coming in and out later at night/early in the morning, it can be quite loud. Also, the road traffic can be noisy (it's New York!). If you;4
Rooms are nice, staff is friendly, and location is perfect.  This was our 3rd visit to this hotel and every time we are very satisfied with our stay.  We grabbed coffee and a pastry each morning in the lobby coffee shop, but most of our meals were at Universal city walk.   It's only a 5 minute walk in the evenings (earlier in the day Universal re routes visitors through an extended security area making it a little tougher to get to city walk directly).  A Quick walk down the hill to the metro can get you anywhere in LA you may want to go.  My only recommendation would be if you are able fly into burbank instead of LAX if this is the side of LA you'd like to stay,  the commute is much quicker.;4
Overall great hotel and the restaurant in the hotel is also great with good food.  We had a nice view on the 34th floor that we requested and were given so that was nice. The qconsierge was polite and welcoming.  Also loved that the hotel was near Madison and many other restaurants. Literally right in front of Madison.  Liked visiting the rooftop bar across from the hotel also so check that out if you stay here.   Do not go to the diner in the hotel ! Food and service were not good at all.;4
We we're surprised to find such a nice room for a good price like this. I took one star off because of the rude bartender downstairs and the weird parking accommodations. Otherwise,a great stay for anyone;4
I stayed in a single cabin room. There was no drama with the shared facilities but I would imagine with that many rooms served by so few bathrooms there could be a traffic jam at times.  The good: clean, neat, tidy, cheap, quirky, quiet (I stayed on the fifth floor), with really great staff.  The bad: the elevator is as slow as a wet week drying up and it didn't work on the day I was leaving so I lugged my heavy bag downstairs. I could have asked for help but that would have made me feel guilty. It is a good five or ten minute walk from a subway which is unusual for lower Manhattan but that is hardly a major complaint.  I would stay here again.;4
We stayed in a very nice room - renovated - no view really from room but appreciated the coffee and waters supplied daily - restaurant in the hotel was tasty as well - we would definitely stay here again if we visit;4
Stayed in room 361. Had a lot of fresh air but also noise from the bar nearby. The mattress could be thicker. I had ventilation also.  My friends stayed in 352, very quiet but not much air and no ventilation although the mattresses were thicker.  Very clean bathrooms. Helpful and friendly staff. Would go again.;4
I would recommend the very stylish Jane Hotel to anyone traveling to NYC on their own for a few nights, or for a couple of friends who want to share a room on the cheap, in a fantastic location.  The standard cabin rooms are absolutely tiny but very well worked out -- with storage above and below the (single) bed, a flat screen tv, an iPod dock... everything you need really.  Also the old-fashioned steamship cabin theme is really well done so if you embrace all that, the small quarters won't bother you at all.  I'm not too mad about the shared bathrooms, wish they had separate ones for men and women -- but alas, no. You really can't beat the location (High Line, Meatpacking, West Village, Soho are a stone's throw away), or the price, or the various perks (gorgeous decor, nice;4
"Stayed here for 6 nights recently. Hotels lovely and in a great location. Arrived and the woman on reception we dealt with was amazing! Gave us a bigger room and was so friendly (sorry I didn't catch her name). However, I can't say the same for other staff members, particularly security. We were having issues with the lock on our room and had to get keys changes a few times. It turned out it was the battery that needed changed however to have one of the staff on security constantly be rude and make remarks about how we ""must be doing it wrong"" was just rude! After a few hours we eventually did get it fixed. Other than this I would recommend the hotel but some staff members definitely need to take customer service more seriously.";4
Room was fairly priced, clean, but small.  Canteen area on a different floor. Extremely convenient to subway, sites (Madison square Garden, Empire state, Central Park). Disconnect with valet parking and Concierge.  Guests compete with Taxis, Liverys, Uber, and  buses. The main entrance is a cluster.;4
Want Chic? Yes. The staff was AMAZING, they were attentive and helped us out with directions to the train and such.  Looking for Rooftop pool and bar? Yes, the pool is super small and not really useful, but a great place to hang out and grab a drink with the girls.  Workout facility? Yes. Don't expect much, but it is nice that they have one.   No worries you are 2 blocks from Central Park!  Easy access to the Subway? Yes. It was a treat for this Chicago girl to be able to use and find fun ways to travel around the city in the subway.;4
I stayed at the New Yorker with my daughter November 2017, the hotel was clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building which was a bonus, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The bathroom could do with updating but apart from that I would definitely stay here again.;4
The rooms are very small with no closet. However, I learned to utilize hooks, shelving, etc. Soon everything had a spot.  Bathroom down hallway - no problem accessing toilet and sink. But shower on my floor was never available when I needed it. You can use one on another floor though. Restaurant was great spot for breakfast. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The room rate can't be beat. In fact, I am returning in April for another stay. It's quirky, but it works fine for me!;4
Good hotel with god location. The breakfast that was included was god with chefs making omeletts and pancakes to order. Room was medium size with a balcony towards the garden. The hotel parking is very expensive and they dont have the information on their site. The parking was $24 + tax, while all streets around the hotel is free street parking that was perfect.;4
Loved the Hilton!  It was very clean and the location couldn't be better for Universal.  The area is beautiful and the staff were very friendly and professional.  As long as you are aware of the parking fees upfront and incorporate them into your budget, then we didn't find that there were any surprises.  The food in the restaurant (like any hotel) is expensive, however for only a short distance you can go to many other locations for food too.  Beds and everything were super comfortable!  Would definitely stay here again.;4
We mostly enjoyed our stay at the Empire Hotel because of the location by Central Park and the Lincoln Center. Subway's station are just a few steps away and the neighborhood is so nice!   There are a lot of good restaurants just across the street that are really nice considering that the hotel's retaurant is too expensive.  But it is the only bad point.  The pool deck and the view there is incredible.;4
We stayed there for a conference and found it to be comfortable, clean and well maintained.   Although there is not much more than Universal City close by, the location is very convenient for a family trip to Universal.  There is a bus that takes you to Universal City Walk which runs about every 10 minutes or so.  However, the trip to city walk is very walkable both day and night.   We were lucky enough to have a refrigerator in the room which I dont think is typical, so we walked to the local super market and got snacks and sanwhiches.  This walk was about .6 miles and there were a couple up hill climbs, so I would not recommend it if you are not up for a bit of a hike or if its a particularly hot day.    There are a number of restaurants and shops within City Walk.   Enough to;4
The hotel was clean, my room was comfortable, I was happy.  The front desk staff was sooo helpful every time I asked a question.   I would recommend the hotel to others.  Grab an Uber and you can be anywhere you want to go!;4
My 83 year old friend had never been to an opera the Met.  We loved the convenience of this hotel, not only in getting to the opera but to everywhere via subway--including the Brooklyn Art Museum!  The desk personnel were so friendly & helpful.  We never had to wait &, if we had, there's a big bowl of delicious apples to munch on to help pass the time.  I stayed here years ago & much preferred the beauty, lightness & brightness of the lobby back then.  However, with the bar & free internet now, the lobby was well used any time we walked thru.  Our room (1114) was large enough & at the end of the hallway so quiet but had no view & was HOT because of the piping (wallboarded in) that went thru it.  Air conditioning barely helped.;4
Hotel is in a great location. Across the road from Penn Street station and Maddison Square Garden. 15 blocks up and one street across your in the middle of Times Square. Rooms are very small but your only there to sleep, so OK. The lifts are the biggest problem there, seems there are only 2 working out of a possible 6 or 7 if your up on the right hand side of the hotel as you approach the lifts, so you end up waiting quite a long time for the lifts. Apart from that, the Hotel is fine for a four or five night stay as we did.;4
We stayed here for 3 nights as part of our trip to Universal studios and were immediately impressed with the hotel.  Stuart at check in was FANTASTIC! He was welcoming and engaging and a great asset to the hotel.  Our room was clean and large and housekeeping was perfect.  The interior of the hotel was beautiful and the shuttle to Universal was an awesome bonus.  All of those contributed to the 4 stars given.  I would have really loved to give 5 but I can't for 2 reasons  1.) Prepare to wait on the elevators.  There are times when the doors have to open 4 times before there is any room.  Seems ridiculous since we have stayed in larger hotels with only 5 elevators and never had a problem.  Maybe they should consider assigning 2 elevators for floors 1-12 and the remaining;4
Answer phones!!!!!!!! speed up elevators or make them all work !!!!!! If someone ask for upgrade and is willing to PAY  for the upgrade why not offer that ?? I stay at your hotel cause i enjoy being across from lincoln center. My son is a soloist with American Ballet theater and from june they perform at the met for 8 weeks !!!!!! so i do come in different times with in that 8 week time frame to see him dance ! i have people come back that i like to entertain at your hotel , but not having any sitting area to speak of it was hard so 1 night i had to entertain in lobby rather then ordering up to the room .;4
The view from our room was phenomenal! The room was freakishly warm even though the air was on and the window was open to the 30 degrees New York winter air. The bellman was incredibly helpful. I was so impressed by his friendliness and willingness to help. The only negative was there was weird stains on the curtains and lampshade of our room which seems like a very strange place for stains to be in the first place.;4
Trip highlighted with US Open! Hurricane Irene delayed our plans, but our hotel kept us safe,comfy, informed and helpful in every way! Staff was very sweet and delightful! Especially Vana and Elvin! Didn't make it to the famous rooftop we'll catch it on our next visit! Great location and hotel!;4
A short walk to Universal Studios which makes it very convenient. The hotel is okay, the rooms could use an update/refresh but clean overall. A nice outdoor pool and hotel tub. The service was fairly good when we had issues.;4
I booked the hotel through Amtrak rewards and got a very good price the hotel itself is classic New York architecture from the 20s 30s great location right across the street from Madison Square Garden in Penn Station blocks away from Empire State Building only a few blocks from Times Square everything in the room work which is most it hasn't 24/7 Diner to Tik Tok which I use all the time and has two smaller restaurants I want Italian in one steak house in the facility which are much more expensive than the tiktok;4
This was a good hotel with lots of personality. Staff were extremely helpful and requests were dealt with promptly. I agree the rooms are smaller than is usual in America but they are nicely decorated and kept extremely clean. The bar and lounge area are very striking and were very popular when we were there. On the down side the paint on our bathroom door was flaking away which was hard to ignore and there was a charge for all extras including tea and coffee. Free wifi only available in the lobby;4
It was clean,  concierge was helpful. The parking is a little high if you rent a car. Easy walk to the City Walk and Universal. Buy from the gift shop only if you need to, $$. Was clean and  tidy. The gym was open all day and night, pool water was not warm.;4
The staff and the service was outstanding...they were very knowledgeable with tourist information and how to make the most of the length of stay. The rooms were as you would expect in a good mid range budget hotel...at $169 USD per night for our two double beds...I thought it was good value...the shower was awesome but it did take a good 10 min for the water to be warm enough....the room was clean, serviced daily, had a coffee maker, comfortable beds..and a hair dryer. The rooms however were stifling hot .there was a old fashioned aircon unit that was very effective but incredibly noisy and being unable to open a window and not get the room cool enough made sleeping difficult...having a laundrette across the road from 8 to 8 made the family washing task easy....at $2.50 or $3.50;4
This hotel is very confortable, has nice rooms , very good structure (gym, sauna,pool).the breakfast is delicious and the omelette made by Hugo are delicious. All the staff is very kindly . My permanence in this hotel was a pleasure. Will advice people coming here when they come to Hollywood.;4
Even though it's not quite what I would classify as a 4 star hotel, the location makes it a a great place to stay while you're visiting Manhattan. Front desk was very accommodating, gave us a great upgrade. (Don't be afraid to pay for the upgrade, it's worthwhile). The Bell staff checked our bags until the room was ready. We had a huge suite on the 38th floor with wonderful views of the Empire State Building. It was really easy to walk to the Park, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Centre, etc, Had a manhattan at the Hotel Bar and lite dinner. Really couldn't ask for more without spending a lot more money. Highly recommended!;4
As big fans of gossip girl from the UK, me & my friend knew of the hotel well before we booked. Although expensive your not really going to find a bargain in the city and especially in great locations. Though it was affordable. We'd paid for a standard double, and we really did get the short straw, we'd already been to Vegas, Miami and and a few other places before we got to NY on our month tour and so far we'd luckily got upgraded randomly every time, so we were slightly disappointed by our room size. But I've been twice before and your really not going to get a decent size room unless your loaded! We ended up with a corner room so the room wasn't quite square and ran on a diagonal, you could barely make your way round the bed and we had no view outside, was just a brick wall.;4
The location of the hotel is perfect, so near to the 96th subway that will connect you to all over Manhattan. Walk to 94th street and you will see the hotel sign, can't miss it.  This is on the broadway so you are surrounded.by shops, markets, restaurants.  I did not encounter rude staff, dirty rooms etc. Everything is nice and perfect, room temperature is good. Internet is free and perfect. Shower mixer is thermostatic so very good.;4
Me and my husband stayed here for three days and two nights. It is conveniently located in Manhattan, Westside. There's a bus stop at the corner, M60 takes you directly to La Gaurdia. The 110th station of #1 train is a few blocks away. There are two Starbuck's nearby, a pharmacy, and a grocery. There's a Catholic Church just next door. I am very happy with the fast internet service. Sheets are changed everyday. Bathroom is newly renovated. The Staff were very friendly and helpful. Neighborhood is generally safe. For a really expensive city to stay at, this Inn gives you the best value for your money.;4
We came for a few days and loved it. The lobby and mezzanine is great for checking in to the free WiFi and having a drink. The roof top cafe and bar is great for a view and for breakfast buffet (at usd28) Our room was nice and big but we had to keep lowering the temperature time and again as it was a bit too hot.  The location is perfect for visiting midtown museums and the Central Park. All within close proximity. Itâs also walking distance to shopping and entertainment at Columbus square or the new Nordstrom. And itâs right next to Lincolncenter with opera house, ballet and the philharmonic orchestra. Totally perfect!!;4
Only few minutes walk from Hammersmith underground station. It takes about 10 minutes to Piccadilly circus by tube, so really close! The room was really clean and the bed was comfortable. Silent area, so I also got a good sleep there! Big plus for a fridge in the room!;4
This hotel is very nice.  Very clean and very convenient to Universal Studios.  We went to the theme park for a while, walked back to the hotel, then back to park.  The restaurant food was good and the staff very helpful.  We loved not having to drive in LA (we only went to Universal Studios).;4
Clean , simple and great location for kensington olympia. Staff really please the and would definitely recommend and stay again. Paid Â£44 for 2 bed dorm and we'll worth it . Although shared kitchen and bathrooms , wasn't a problem at all. Only negative was it was a bit noisy as group of men in bigger room next door.;4
"I stayed for 7 nights, solo and really enjoyed my stay at The Jane - my first time in NYC and I definitely see myself returning soon from London.  Pros: - Great staff - Kevin and (a young Asian bellhopper/porter - I forget his name, sorry!) were really helpful; - The Cafe is really nice. Loved the avocado and chilli toast in the morning. - Met some cool people (my favourite was Marta, a lady from Spain that you could tell was in love with NYC on her first visit!) - The Ballroom is pretty cool. Almost a little surreal how much it feels like a rich frat-party. Tried quite a few of the cocktails and there were some interesting ones, but probably nothing to my taste out of the ones I tried. I went a Friday and Saturday and it was always packed. During the week it was a little";4
I stayed here for a conference in March and was very impressed with everything from the room quality to the staff's attentiveness. The place is immaculate, the rooms spacious, and the services top-notch -- something I've come NOT to expect from big corporate chain hotels. As well, the pool area (and some other outdoor areas) provided very relazing respites from an otherwise grueling weekend of meetings.  My one complaint, and it's fairly significant, is that some of my belongings were stolen from one of the ballrooms where our conference was held. This happened to another conference-goer as well. So whereas the general hotel staff is excellent in every way, I am less than happy with the folks they hire to clean up the place. Also their security reminded me of Mayberry RFD.;4
We came to New York 25th February for 5 nights staying at the New Yorker hotel on 8th Avenue. The hotel is really good, definitely check about paying resort tax. This is for amenities you may not use. WiFi in the rooms, gym etc. Our room was small but comfy, slept like a log in the comfy bed. The hot bath is great after full days walking around the city. Getting about via the subway is the best method. Just buy a metro card from any machine and load it with cash. There is so much to see and do. I booked our city pass early to go and see the main sights. The shops and bars and cafes are everywhere. You can eat and drink 24hrs. But you need a rest. I would definitely stay here again. We had no issues. It snowed when we came, but it just made it more beautiful. Bring lots of cash;4
Stayed here for 3 nigts with the family on our way to Mexico. Hotel is newly refurbished and rooms present as new & clean. Staff acred for us exceptionally well and restaurant fare was well priced, of good quality, tasty and portion sizes were satisfying, but not too large. Hotel is super close to LAX. Highly recommended if you need a good place to stay close to the airport. I noticed a lot of flight crews staying, which is always a good indicator....;4
When I got in the HHonors Members check-in line last Friday the clock on the wall above the clerks head read 5:35 PM. The `common folks' line was much longer so I figured this the best bet. I made a mental note the people at the end of that line. By 6:00 they were long gone as were to of the people that were behind me, but switched. By 6:15 I was finally being issued a room key and was at the door by 6:30. 55 minutes, NOT A GOOD WAY to end a three hour, traffic congested, drive to the San Fernando Valley!!  The room was on the 19th floor. It was a `corner' room overlooking Universal Studios with a wonderful view of the SF Valley and the mountains. The room and bath were clean and well appointed. The spacious bathroom was tiled in travertine as was the shower walls and;4
Stayed from 4th till 8th July hotel is ideal for getting about rooms are a bit small air conn is noisy but rooms are only for sleeping inBar prices are ok and for a good drink the Colosiuem bar is down the road at Columbus circle.;4
I have been to Disneyland and California before but Iâve never been to LA specifically Hollywood. The hotel we stayed at Hollywood hotel was great the breakfast was awesome and tasty. The room was clean the bed comfortable.;4
We stayed in a standard queen. The room was very clean to my liking and Sarah at the front desk allowed us to check in 4 hours prior to check in time. The only negative is room did not come with mini fridge as stated on the website. However, hotel staff was very accommodating to bring ice and water to our room upon request. Overall great stay and would book again!;4
We were at the Empire Hotel in March 2017 for spring break, although not experiencing spring-like weather!  We had an excellent experience there.  Friendly staff, clean rooms, good service.  NYC is expensive, and we found a pretty good deal on a double room online.  The bathroom was small, but it had a great shower.  The beds were comfortable, especially the pillows!  We wanted to take those home with us!  We never ate at the restaurant for breakfast or dinner, but the food smelled good and the menu was interesting.  The hotel is right by Lincoln Center, a subway station, and lots of fun dining options.  We enjoyed the rooftop bar, but be prepared to pay for your view.  We used taxis and Ubers, and they would pull up right to the front of the hotel.  All of the guys at the front;4
a nice hotel in a first class location.our room was very comfortable,but did not have any sort of view.very busy even in February.this was first visit to new york ,and wasn't sure what to take in the way of clothing,but found a ski type jacket bobble hat and a scarf,perfect,no need to take anything to smart.;4
I can't imagine a much better location for a classy hotel. Near Times Square, Hell's Kitchen, Restaurant Row, Madison Square Garden, Radio City, etc. the associated restaurants were great and the service was impeccable. Drais (sp?) at the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. The place was very clean. The only complaint was that the rooms were VERY cramped with microscopic bathrooms. Oh well.....the bed was comfortable;4
Reading reviews of Days Hotel we really expect find something between average and terrible. But our experience was really nice. Of course, you will find better hotels in other places for the same budget, but remember, this is Manhattan. The location is fantastic! Just a few steps from a subway station. Great neighborhood. Good restaurants nearby. And above all, three blocks from mid Central Park.   If you want just a fine place to sleep after a long walk in New York this might be your hotel. The hotel staff is efficient and helpfull. Room and bathroom were clean and the beds are comfortable. If you forgive a noisy wooden floor (which the carpet hides), the freak elevators and you donÂ´t book a hotel to watch tv, we strongly recommend it.  P.s.: no bugs at all.;4
Excellent location, easy access to Times Square.  We were on 4th floor so had some noise from street.  Staff was helpful and polite.  We experienced long delay in getting our room, then had some confusion about which rook we should have.  Rooms are small, even for NYC, but adequate and clean.  Bathrooms were very modern, but limited space.  Nice lobby, cold when we were there and not sure why HUGE fireplace was not on.;4
We were celebrating our 8th wedding anniversary and as part of our itinerary customised by our tour agent, we stayed in The New Yorker for 3 nights. We were first given the executive room on the 7th floor. The room was very nice and newly renovated but very small. Despite having a coffee machine, amazing shower and charging station on both side tables, we felt claustrophobic so asked to be moved upstairs with a view. We were moved to the 28th floor. The room was dated but lighter and bigger. The shower head was very close to the wall but we were amazed how strong the water pressure was. The bed and pillows were excellent. We need this kind of bed in our home! This hotel is located near Madison Square, Penn Station, Macyâs and Empire State Building. After checking in, 2 ladies;4
We are 2 work colleagues that were looking for a cheap end hotel in easy reach of the New York sights and sounds. The Jane fit the bill perfectly!! It was a lovely upcoming place that had a great bar (doubled as a nightclub on the weekends), the rooms were tiny, with bunk beds, each bunk had its own T.V. The bathrooms were plentiful and amazingly clean. I usually travel with the wife and have a room fit for us both, this was a room for 2 fellas to go out and use as an ideal location for somewhere to sleep. We loved it...great price and great location, ideal for walking to the 9/11 site, going to the meat packing district area or getting the subway in to Times Square. Please guys visit this quaint and very American hotel at a cheap price...ideal for friends wanting somewhere;4
The hotel is right under the London Eye, close to most of London city attractions. Were able to walk to the theatre, to the museums and other attractions. 2 minutes walk to Waterloo tube ad train stations for getting to sites further away;4
Hotel was lovely and the staff were great upon check in and in the bar. The rooms were a little dated but after staying in nyc over 5 times this was one of the comfiest beds I have slept in. The housekeeping were lovely and couldnât give us enough shower gel, shower caps etc. If I could change anything it would be the heat of the room. It was boiling and when we opened the windows it was really noisy from the air conditioning units. I would 100% stay here again but would maybe ask for a room on a higher floor away from the noise as if I was a light sleeper I would have been up all night. The hairdryer provided was a good one compared to other hotels and there is a small fridge to store drinks in etc. The cocktails in the hotel bar are lovely and the location is great. Columbus;4
"I stayed here one night, on a layover at LAX.  The hotel has a great location:  among all of the hotels on Century Blvd., it is the closest to the terminals.  In fact, it is within walking distance, especially if you are flying into terminals 1-3; being able to walk to and from the hotel eliminates a lot if waiting for the shuttle, especially in LAX's endless traffic loop.  I did the walk late (around 11p) and felt safe; several others were also walking.    The hotel is a renovated old property.  Some of the outside feels old, but the inside is fresh and the design of the lobby and rooms very modern.  My room was bright, with fun pops of color, and had a nice seating area.  Standard amenities--in-room coffee, fast internet, etc.  Plugs were ample and well-placed.  My room was";4
This hotel built in 1929 is very nice.  By todayâs standards the rooms are small and bathrooms dated but we loved it.  All the staff was fantastic and friendly.  In a great location for bus, subway, or rail travel.  I would recommend this hotel to all.   Restaurants in the hotel are nice but there are many options nearby for about any type of food you want.  Stay at The New Yorker and you should not regret it.  Go enjoy the âBig Appleâ and have fun.;4
An excellent hotel with a great location our room wasn't huge but was comfortable and sufficent as a base for us  . All staff were friendly and helpful . The Tick Tock diner is located on the ground floor of the hotel and is open 24 hours and has a varied menu. The subway system we found confusing even for the locals! We were asked for help by one of them .;4
After booking this hotel, my wife & I read reviews which started to worry us. At one point, we were tempted to book another hotel, as some were really bad but we need not have worried. On arrival, we were given a room on the second floor, which was very nice but to close to the street noise. My wife went back to Reception, to ask for a room higher up & we were given one on the sixth floor, which was ideal as we are both light sleepers. The room was on the small side but fine for our needs, as we would only be using it for sleeping & showering in. We hope, that the following points are helpfull to anyone considering a stay at this hotel.  The hotel.  The staff are friendly & helpfull.  The lobby is clean & Comfortable, with vending machines & internet downstairs. The only problem;4
Our family stayed one night prior to a day at Universal Studios and then a late night flight home. There were no issues with them storing our luggage through the day.  The rooms were clean and relatively spacious. Service was mostly great. Become a Hilton member for free before booking for digital key access, free internet access, and a choice to choose your own room.;4
The room was small and dark, and the view - nadda.... but it is NYC so expected.  The hotel staff were very helpful.  Wifi is only free in the lobby, but we didnât mind chilling there checking our messages.  The room comes with a mini bar, umbrella and safe, although the safe is on the floor in the back of the closet so you have to get down on your hands and knees with a flashlight (no light in the closet) to access it.  We found the bed comfortable.  We didnât partake in their morning breakfast as there is a deli on the corner which we enjoyed.   Their car service offered to the airport is a better rate than the one at the airport but we suspected that.  The location is really perfect for walking and subway.  Easy walk to Central Park, the Met, Rockefeller centre, MOMA, time;4
i went with my brother for 7 days and enjoyed my stay especially the morning breakfast service from sonia, its not the best of areas appearance wise. however it was very good for the price and the quality of the rooms were good, can do with a little redecoration but I'm not complaining.;4
My four friends and I choose to stay at The Jane based on price, I was prepared for the small rooms however just not how small they really are.  We stayed a week as part of a three week visit to North America and although the rooms were a very good price the rooms were probably too small for the length of our stay.  The rooms are very narrow with barely enough room for two people to pass each other, there is very little storage in the room with two drawers under the bottom bunk, one of which holds a room safe reducing the volume of the drawer significantly.  The shared bathrooms are very nice, nicely tiled and kept clean, with soap, shampoo and conditioner provided. The showers themselves are nice and hot with plenty of water with adequate room in the cubicle to change etc.  We;4
Arriving at10.45 pm after flying in from London, I was feeling a but tired and apprehensive ....Amazing foyer area in this Art Deco Hotel. Staff were friendly, my check in was a breeze, done in a matter of minutes and straight up to my room.  Spotlessly clean room which wasn't overly large but it was all I needed for a trip to NYC, as I intended to be out and about not cooped up. large bed, wardrobe, chest of drawers, bedside tables, safe, bath and shower, decent mirror, plenty of towels and constant hot water. The fittings may have been the original but worked well. A/C but no kettle or fridge, I coped!! The chamber maids were around every day and always spoke, lobby staff friendly and helpful only issue here was at busy times there are not enough lifts for 950+ rooms. The;4
I understand how this hotel isn't for everyone. In a way it's more like a hostel than a 'hotel'. But personally , I really enjoyed my one night stay here. I was on the first floor, and of course could hear the traffic, but it didn't bother me. The room was tiny, but I like smaller spaces and again, for one night it was perfect. Tiny bathroom sink was kind of adorable. Great water pressure in the shower (I have thick hair so that was a treat). The bed was incredibly comfortable and I got a great sleep that night. I would have definitely stayed longer had circumstances allowed. The staff was incredibly helpful - I have medication that needs to be refrigerated and they stored it in their staff room, and very nice when I had to bug them at midnight for my evening dose. The location;4
This was the first time to the NYC.  We had arrived by cruise ship to Port Liberty, NJ and the ship had a bus taking passengers to Penn Station among other places.  This hotel is right beside the station so we could walk to it.  Luckily we checked in before the mass horde showed up.  Our room was nice with a large bed, large TV and clean bathroom.  We were on a corner on the 32nd floor and had two windows, one in each wall which was nice.  One window gave us a good view of Manhattan.  We had free high speed WiFi and had no problems using it.  The ice machine was down the hall making it convenient.  The blue line subway had an entrance right besides the hotel and other lines were within one or two blocks making it very convenient.  The hotel had a diner called Tick Tock which was;4
We had a great time at the New Yorker. Our room had an outstanding view, the location was perfectly situated near the subway, Times Square and Madison Square Garden! The staff was outstanding and the Tick To k diner was awesome!;4
We were surprised buy the tiny tiny size of the room.  I also missed not having a coffee service in the room.  We were frustrated that there were so few ice machines on such a big property and many were not working.;4
My husband and I always enjoy our stay at the Empire Hotel.  Its in a great location on the Upper Westside.  In great walking distance to Time Square and other popular locations.  Great place to stay for couples.;4
Enjoyed a three night stay at the New Yorker,an old fashioned hotel near Penn station New York. This is not a modern swish New York hotel but a quirky Art Deco palace with loads of character and great staff, they even give us an upgrade on our room when they noticed it was my wife's birthday. So we ended up with a good view and a quiet room.  Close to Madison Square Garden arena,Penn Station Macy's ,the Empire State Building and access to Metro for the rest of the city. Not the best hotel I have ever stayed in but one I would use again and again.;4
We stayed here for 5 nights has a nice atmosphere friendly staff , rooms were very clean clean towels every day comfortable beds ,it has a bar restaurant and diner ok prices, the hotel itself is central would recommend it;4
The hotel was exceptional as one of many choices I have sampled for a transit stay at LAX . Staff were extremely courteous , helpful and warm . The room was large , modern and tastefully decorated with a large TV , numerous channels available and the bed was comfortable . Aircraft noise was minimal . Unity , the major Food outlet in the lobby , is open 24 hours and food choices are wide and varied and dishes are very tasty . Excellent , fast , free , frequent and friendly shuttle to all terminals at LAX and very helpful drivers . This will be my hotel of choice for LAX from now on.;4
My friend and I travelled to LA from Jan. 18-23 for a girl's getaway.  Neither of us had visited California before.  We landed at around 4:30pm, picked up our rental car at the airport, and took off to find the hotel.  It's about a 30 minute drive from LAX (depending on traffic) and we found it with no issues.   At first, we were a little nervous of the location, but we quickly learned that it's really not a bad area.  All of LA is pretty dingy and dirty-ish, so I think we just needed to get used to the big city. We walked as much as possible, and even went 8 blocks on-foot at night to Palermo's Italian restaurant in Los Feliz (amazing food, by the way). Yes there are some homeless people around, but they seemed to be harmless and we were not hassled by anyone.  We were totally;4
My wife and I stayed here over new years. Firstly I had contacted the hotel before my arrival to explain it was a special occasion. We received a upgrade and 2 small bottles of champagne, which was a fantastic start and a big thanks to Katya Bronson. The hotel is perfectly located, and a few minutes walk to the subway. There is also a starbucks literally outside, century 21 is also a few minutes walk away. There are a few restaurants and bars also very nearby. We found the staff to be extremely helpful, even printing out tickets we had to see the Knicks - big thanks to Ricky Jones. Only downside was the chargeable WIFI, however when in the lobby it is free. Very happy with our choice and would return.;4
We reserved a budget triple room for 2 nights. At first we called someone if we could have an extra bed for the 4th person because originally we booked for 3. However, we couldn't get it. At first night, we saw that 4 people could live in that room(but we found out later that the person at front desk named Patrick assigned us to deluxe double room) so we decided to live there without telling him. However, he noticed it wasn't only 3 people but he kindly gave us that room so we didn't have to pay. We would recommend others to stay here because staffs are friendly, the location is close to subway and many restaurants so it's easy to go out and have fun. Moreover, the room is also clean.;4
Staying here in New York in September. Huge centrally located hotel with good facilities. Allocated room that was so noisy we couldn't sleep...literally. Went to reception and asked to be moved...no problem at all and was allocated an upgraded (and very quiet) room on night 2. Hotel is being upgraded but is clearly an iconic building. Really great location, exceptional staff and look forward to returning when all rooms have been upgraded!;4
I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend this weekend. It was nice, very clean and affordable. The room had old furniture but the water was hot, the bed was comfy and the location is great. The other reviews were entirely too harsh. It is not a 5 star hotel but it serves as a nice place to sleep and keep your belongings as you explore the greatest city on earth.;4
great location and great neighborhood with easy access to all places you want to go in NYC on foot or by train. Room is also good, but as many previous guests had complained, the shower room does not have a full shower door/curtain, which makes the floor wet if you're not too careful. I will consider staying there again next time.;4
Staff very helpful, awesome bed and shower to rest after walk during all day. Very good localization to go to Central Park, midtown and broadway, the hotel is also close to the subway station in Columbus Circle. To find a good and cheap restaurant in the area is the worse part.;4
The hotel offers comfortable and clean rooms, very good bathrooms and a great location for a reasonable price. You can pick coupons at the front desk to have discount on breakfast in nearby restaurants. Subway station is just around the corner, but you can also walk down Broadway or alonside Central Park and reach Times Square and West Village for instance. I would definitely stay at Days Inn Broadway again.;4
Would recommend this hotel purely for the location. It is right near Madison Square Garden, basically opposite it. Me and my brother visited and had the room 1945, which included a view of the empire state building and it was incredible. It is also near times square. Overall perfect location. The hotel itself felt like an apartment, no B&B so you have to get up and leave to eat out, which isn't that much of a problem. You also have to show your key card as soon as you walk in before you get the lift to your floor. The rooms were clean and me and my brother were pleasantly surprised we both had a double bed each. The shower on the other hand wasn't the most comfortable, the heating was fine but the bath itself that you stand in just wasn't comfortable. The shampoo and conditioner;4
We found this to be a good, clean hotel with good service.  We'd tried to upgrade our room using a link in a confirmation email.  However, the type of room we requested was not available upon arrival.  An email informing us of this would have been nice - but that's the only complaint about our stay.  The hotel accommodated us by providing a smaller room until a larger one could be arranged later in the day - so no worries.;4
It is easy to find a 5-star hotel that meets expectations. But, sometimes circumstances don't allow us to stay in luxury hotels! For reasons of cost (it was graduation week in NY, and hotel rates had  doubled an tripled - no joke), and location, our TripAdvisor research took us to Astor on the Park. Yes, we did have a view of Central Park - and great access to the park.  We ended up spending free time between graduation activities, exploring it for hours!  The lobby is small, dark and worn. But, the greeting at reception was warm and we were able to check into our room hours before the official check-in time.  The room was smallish and worn out.  BUT, the bed was a king and very comfortable. The washroom was mainly updated, and very nice.  The shower was great. The whole place;4
Stayed at the hotel for 6 nights. Check in was easy and the staff very friendly. Location is great with Times Square and Central Park a short walk away. Room was lovely and clean bathroom was modern and a good shower. Staff was very helpful and arranged our taxi back to the airport. Will definitely stay at this hotel again.;4
What a delight this hotel is. Steeped in history, all of which is proudly preserved, whether within the elegance of the hotel or in its small museum downstairs. It holds many stories within its walls. The staff are delightful at all times. Check in was fast and proficient  Yes the room (a queen) was quite small but really not that bad, everything needed was there. Only a coffee machine lacking and housekeeping bought one up immediately on request Our only problem was, when we went for our pm showers we couldnât get any hot water through. Rang reception. Immediately sent an engineer,  but before he could look into the matter reception called to say they were upgrading us. So off we went. Not quite sure about the supposed $100 more per night the new room should be costing. It was;4
A modern, clean and friendly hotel perfectly situated just off Times Square.  Efficient and friendly staff, great daily servicing if room.  Comfy bed and super clean room and hotel.  Nice facility of having coffee/tea/got chocolate and water available in reception through the day .  All staff a genuinely friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Ameritania .;4
Before going I checked all the reviews here - I believe being nice is the quickest way to ensure good service, and was not disappointed.  We were there for 9 days and got a really big room, the microwave and fridge were perfect for us since we were traveling with our toddler.  The beds were big and just right.  The breakfast offered is substantial and good, and the recently re-done pool is quite pretty.  The only issue we had was with the soap dispenser in the laundry room  - we got our money back but they should be replaced if they don't work.;4
We stayed here for 4 nights. Location is quite acceptable as although not central it is very close to both bus and metro stops. Check in staff were friendly and helpful. The room was a reasonable size, well appointed and clean. The floors however that were tiled could have been a little better swept and kept free of dust etc. The hotel serves a complimentary breakfast however that is really good with excellent choices and a varied spread. If in LA I would stay here again as it definitely offered VFM .;4
I fly in and out of LAX a lot, and usually drive down from a Santa Barbara and stay at this property.   This is a recently renovated, very large property. It has a good Regency Club, with a fantastic manager called Cairo.   The rooms are more like a Hyatt Centric than a Regency, including the really odd and frustrating lighting arrangements.   The great thing about this hotel however is itâs location: I walk across Sepulveda Blvd to United (terminal 7) and it takes me about 10 minutes from hotel to check-in desk. The property abuts the Quick Park garage which is easily accessed from 96th street from the La Tejera 405 exit. On my return last week from Wyoming, I was off the plane, into the car and on the road in 20 minutes.   Two words of caution:  Do not use the hotel valet;4
"Stayed at The Empire for 3 nights in March '14 in a Superior Double room. Check-in was quick and efficient and all staff encountered were very helpful and friendly.  The room (and entire hotel) is decorated to a lovely standard. Clean and modern throughout, maid service daily. The room was spacious and had everything that you needed; mini-fridge, hairdryer, iron etc. The beds were a little firm for my liking but overall rather comfortable and sleeping was not a problem. Prices for the in-room snacks and drinks are expensive, but there is a Starbucks and Duane Reeds right next door so just buy from there.  One thing that did bother me was the temperature of the hotel, it was too warm! It was too hot to sleep under the covers. However, I arrived just after the 'Polar Vortex' had";4
Stayed here one night with my best friend after seeing a concert. Location is great! Walking distance to Times Square and Radio City! There is a bar next door so that was nice to have a few drinks and head up to our room!  Upon check in, the woman who checked us in could have been a bit more friendly but she wasnât mean or unprofessional. One thing that totally blew the day we were there was only 1 out is 3 elevators was working and it took forever to get up to our floor. What was even more aggravating was as we were about to get on the elevator, the backside of the elevator opened and a person started vacuuming the floor of the elevator. Seriously? There is a line of people. Once on the elevator, it started to glitch up so we were forced to climb 7 flights of stairs in the;4
Way up on 105th St. is this little, old style hotel that overlooks the park ! The rooms are small and bare bones but so is the price *$*. After searching dozens of hotels via booking.com and others, found this is the ONLY one with a private bath for under 150. We paid about 124 including taxes. It's clean, quiet, in a mellow neighborhood, 2 blocks from the subway(blue line) and the staff were all friendly and helpful. Heat was a bit slow to come on but the shower was as good as the Ritz :) On a budget ? - This is it.;4
The hotel is a great location as your in the middle of New York, the rooms are clean which is perfect as itâs only to sleep etc , great value and great views.staff are helpful and always there to assist;4
Traveling with my family, we arrived at the Empire after a late night flight and were exhausted.  Our room did not have any air conditioning, the window was propped open and so we called and asked for someone to come fix the air conditioning to help cool it off and to help with the hum mm of traffic outside -- and instead they (THANK YOU RICKY!) kindly gave us a new room (with an upgrade to off set the initial inconvenience).  We fell into comfortable beds with crisp sheets and slept great.   This is a good hotel, everyone was helpful/kind.  And the location on Columbus Circle is excellent -- a wonderful neighborhood with little cafes and restaurants and the subway right there.  We could easily stay here again. My only sadness was that the rooftop pool area became filled with;4
We were in NYC from March 11-March 13, 2005 and stayed at Your Stay Central Park.  The reason we chose this hotel (technically it's not a hotel) was because of the proximity to the Beacon Theatre on 74th and Broadway.  Your Stay is on 73th and Broadway and is stone's throw from the Beacon so it is a great location if you are going to a show and need a place to stay in the neighborhood.  Of course, our first choice was the Beacon Hotel but that was booked up due to the concerts.  We go and see the Allman Brothers Band play every March (this was the 10th year in a row seeing them) and the Beacon Hotel is always booked during their stint.  So we asked the person working at hotels to get us a room at the next closest place she had, which turned out to be Your Stay.  I was reluctant;4
"Fantastic location (even if the neighborhood wasn't as good) for trips and activities in Hollywood.  We were in room 223, and the bathroom needed some love.  I'm 5'8"" and the shower head was at MY nose level.  Too short for me and WAY too short for my husband.  And the shower handle was bad and very hard to get to work properly.  Even though the room was booked for two people we had to request fixings for the second person's morning coffee.  No meet and greet while we were there and no Jacuzzi on the premises (not that they said there was one!).  ONE OF THE BEST INCLUDED BREAKFASTS WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED!!  Overall very good, just some deferred maintenance issues that should be addressed.";4
The Hollywood Hotel is a pretty no frills place, but for the traveler more concerned with what's happening outside the hotel rather than in, it's just right. The mini fridge in the room was perfect for holding beers and sangria, and the microwave even came in useful when we found ourselves snacking on leftovers for one dinner.  The pool is a lovely place to cool down on especially hot LA days, although its closing time of 8pm is a little premature in my opinion.  The housekeeping staff do a wonderful job of keeping your room tidy, although we were perplexed to find coca - cola splashed on our bathroom door, which was apparently missed by them before we checked in.  The free continental breakfast is a nice option, as it helps cut down on some of your trip expenses,  and has;4
Great hotel to stay at. Check in staff are very helpful and efficient. Concierge and Porter services are great too. Rooms are a decent size and beds are really comfortable. You can't beat the location - Universal Studios and Universal Walk are so close - only takes 5 minutes over the walkway to get there. The only downside was that our room was on Level 2 and it can get quite noisy as it is on the same level as the Pool, so avoid it if you can. We were only there for 2 nights so we just put up with it. If your room ends up being on Levels 1 or 2, remember to go DOWN in the elevator as reception is on the 3rd floor even though the hotel entrance is on this level. We didn't realise this at first and had to ride the elevator all the way to the 20th floor!;4
The staff at the hotel were great. Check in and out was a breeze. It's an incredible location, and the view from the rooftop bar is amazing. The rooftop bar, rooms, and lobby are pretty small...while the bar on the lobby level is ginormous.   I stayed in a Captain's Cabin which was small, but I knew that going in and it was more than adequate for my needs. My only tiny gripe is the shower curtain was starting to mold and the towels were clean, but some were not in the greatest shape. That said, I would definitely stay again.;4
great view of the hudson, central to everywhere, great diner and friendly staff, whats not to like,,its dated yes but clean, penn station is outside the door and dunkin doughnuts for coffee, your in times square in 4 mins;4
Great hotel in a prime location for Universal Studios!  My room was nicely sized, clean and perfectly located.  Parking cost is a little steep and not included in room rate which is unfortunate.    Was here for one night for business but would stay here for pleasure and proximity anytime!!;4
Shared bathroom but clean and couldn't find better value. Nice cafÃ©, great bar, and friendly staff. good for travelling with mates or by yourself, but not romantic. Tiny but well formed rooms with tv and just enough storage.;4
"The Empire Hotel is one of those classic hotels that has been very well maintained over the years.  The decor is very attractive, the place is very clean.  The Lobby Bar is a very friendly place for a quick drink or a quick bite to eat.  In many reviews of New York city hotels, there's usually a comment about how small the rooms are.  The rooms in the Empire are ""New York"" size as well.  If you compared a New York Hotel room to, say, a room in Philadelphia or any other medium to large city, yes, the rooms would seem small.  But, if you are in New York for either business or pleasure, I hope you are not planning to spend any appreciable amount of time in your hotel room.  With that in mind, the rooms are perfectly acceptable.  There's enough space for you and your luggage and";4
Nice, clean, not-to-old double bed room. Cool modern bathroom. Location doesn't look good on a map, but Hammersmith's high street is just around the corner, there are four different tube lines at Hammersmith station. 20 mins to Picadilly Circus, more than half an hour to the City and East End.  The only downside was the presence of cockroaches of some sorts. They were hiding under bed, closet and in nooks and cranies around the room, bathroom and hallway. In four days I killed five, and spotted some five more. So it's not like you are in a danger to be eaten alive.  It's still one of the best hostels I've ever slept in London.;4
Stayed here for 2 nights for capitals summertime ball in a twin room. Hotel is 3 minute walk from the tube stop which goes all over london so very handy. The rooms are very basic but clean and our room came with a fridge great for putting beers/wine in. The hotel is in a nice location in hammersmith so not dodgy and lots of restaurants and bars, including a wetherspoons and nandos -Â£3 for a gin and tonic in hammersmith is not bad. For about Â£30 a night you really can't complain - will be coming back.;4
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 8 nights. It's located in East Hollywood and only a few minutes walk to the Metro that allowed us to travel to Hollywood/Universal City and other locations quite easily. Hotel staff were very welcoming and always had to the time to say hello as we were passing through reception. We stayed on the 3rd  floor, standard double room which overlooked the courtyard. Rooms were a good size, clean with a comfy bed, power shower and large bathroom and good A/C. Some of the decor looked a little tired in places and the Google cromecast hit and miss at times. We had breakfast a couple of times. Was okay but nothing to shout about so we ate out mostly. Lovely pool area with plenty of loungers, music playing and clean towels to use.  Hotel comes with guest;4
Great location and Dean at the front desk was super nice and friendly!  It was late at night when we arrived and he was a great welcome after a long day!  My mobile key wasnât working so had to stop by.  The room was big and quiet but had a slight older musty smell to it. It just needs to be updated. There was also no mirror in the room, only in the bathroom so it was hard to do my hair when others where using the bathroom. Some of the outlets donât work, wonât hold the plug in. The bathroom was a great size. Someone had left a used soap bar in the shower. The shower head needs replacing as water was not coming out fully. I liked the cafe and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed the outside courtyard!;4
Good location, near the Subway, and perfect for a relaxing moment in Central Park, if you don't want to be in the crowds of midtown. Also good prices, and friendly personnel. Rooms are good, but not superb.;4
"We stayed in the hotel for four nights in late February, a nice welcome at check in and offered complimentary breakfast ""grab and go"" style from the coffee kiosk in the main reception, the room was nice newly refurbished on 21st floor while  the public parts of the hotel could do we updating. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to any request. The best part about the hotel is it's location on 8th Ave, three subway stops uptown and you are in Central Park, four subway stops and you are on Broad St. ground zero, one tower observatory etc.. and then only a few blocks walk you are at the Port Authority bus station for those in need of retail therapy and a trip to jersey gardens (Bus111 $14 return), also hotel directly opposite Madison Square Garden I would highly";4
We believe this has a somewhat negative image but we really liked this hotel. It has a fascinating history and is really well placed for a trip to NYC. A bonus is the the Tick Tock diner is integral to the building and it is well worth having breakfast there.  We didn't have a full view window but it would be worth asking for especially on a high floor.;4
Stayed in a room with a side view of Harry Potter Castle. Swift check in and very spacious room. Hotel is 5 min walk from main entrance of Universal studio and has a shuttle bus to studios also. As we had purchased VIP experience ( an exceptional way to treat your kids and avoid huge rush) at 7:30 AM it was most ideally located hotel. A very comfortable stay with courteous staff.;4
We stayed Christmas 2014 at the Empire Hotel New York. On arrival the receptionist are very polite. Our room was on the smaller side compare to other American cities I have visited although I was aware of this prior to arrival. New York hotel rooms are a lot smaller than say Las Vegas or Florida. The room was clean and modern and the bathroom was also clean, The lifts are a little slow although I didn't mind to much. Noise outside can be a little loud so if possible try and get a room on a high floor.  Location as excellent. A Deli was only a 2 min walk away for breakfast. Subway was also very close. Starbucks around the corner if you need your Coffee fix in the morning.  We Stayed for 5 x nights in total and I would recommend this hotel if your looking for a place to lay your;4
My husband and I recently stayed at the Ramada Inn on a recent trip to California. This was our second stay at the hotel and once again, we loved it! The staff were  friendly and helpful, the rooms were large and very clean. The lobby and hotel are tastefully decorated. The continental breakfast was fabulous as well!! The room we got overlooked the nice courtyard.     Unlike other reviewers, we LOVED the neighbourhood! This is the only area in LA that we would stay as we were a couple of blocks away from the trendy Los Feliz area of Hollywood, which has lots of great shopping and dining locales. We even saw a few celebrities in the area!! If you keep driving up N. Vermont Avenue, (where you pass lots of beautiful homes) you will find yourself in Griffith Park and further up into;4
My sister and I traveled for my birthday week to NYC. It was our first time to the States and we chose this hotel because of the pictures we saw online and overall reviews...we were not disappointed.  The location is absolutely great to begin with. Train station less than 10mins walk and Times Square is around a 25-30min walk. The hotel itself is asthetically nice to take pictures at. We were upgraded to a bigger room on arrival which was very kind of them, HOWEVER, the view from our room was very disappointing. We were just facing another high rise building and didn't get the great city view/skyline. The room itself was nice and very spacious. The decor throughout the hotel is from the Art Deco era and I liked it. Also if you are a fan of American Horror Story it reminded me of;4
We checked into The New Yorker after a horrible stay at The Pennsylvania.  Our room was 100% nicer, the staff was great, loved the heated floors in the bathroom!;4
Hotel chosen as we favour the Hilton brand and I have gold card . Important that we were located near to all activities in the greater Hollywood area . For this the hotel was perfect . The room was good and the view from the room (requested) excellent . The staff friendly and professional . Breakfast choice was extensive and the food well prepared - set us up well for the day .  The pool area was being renovated whilst we were there - but the staff still looked after guests well . Facilities first class . The bar in the hotel was good and staff friendly and efficient . If you happen to be in the hotel on a weekday there is an excellent happy hour 3-6 with half price appetisers . Ate in the bar and restaurant on a couple of occasions - both very good . We are from the UK and;4
Stayed at the Empire with a group of friends, we had a suite so there was plenty of room for all of us.  The location can't be beat - you're just across the street from Lincoln Center, a quick walk to Central Park and a manageable walk to Times Square. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for great accommodations and location.;4
We stayed there to be close to universal studio - it is a 5 min walk there. They do have a shuttle which seems meaningless... Rooms are of a good size for a family of four. Our room had an excellent view of the city from the 15th floor. Room service was fast and relatively cheap. The breakfast buffet was very good. Parking with in/out is easy. They had some issues with their elevators which resulted in a bit of a wait sometimes. I recommend this for universal - and Warner Brothers is a short drive away.;4
We went to New York with six people and I was dreading the cost as we were somewhat on a budget and in NY, your dollar doesn't stretch that far. I booked the Morningside Inn as a compromise and was glad that I did.  The location is good, easy for the subway (four blocks walk down to 103rd street - we always took breakfast on the way from one of the decent, cheap restaurants there) and subway is about quarter of an hour into Time Sq. Didn't entirely feel comfortable with the area late at night but you could easily have caught a cab back as its not far out of the city. Tick for location.  When we turned up, the manager was unable to satisfy the booking as the internet had only shown my booking as one room not two.  Not a problem - the manager sorted out extra beds for the room.;4
Nice hotel and close to Universal Studios. Only complaint is that wifi is only accessible from lobby and this is a huge inconvenience. In 2013, most hotels offer free in-room Wifi and charging guests at an already expensive hotel is nothing more than a cash grab.;4
Great location close to everything just a short walk to times square.  Had a wonderful view. Security was good always asked to see our key card before allowing anyone on the elevators. Great to have a 24 hour restraunt onsite.;4
Recently stayed at the empire hotel,  it's nice and clean ...but ask to stay as high up as possible as initially we were on floor 1 and we're looking at a rusty pipe..do not eat and drink there as it's so expensive,  I ordered one bottle of wine and 2 small bottles of water...It cost me 96 dollars!  There's a convenience store nxt to Starbucks right by hotel that's open 24 hrs to get whatever from...pretty much wherever you are they'll add a surcharge on...there's a brilliant security person there named Denis,  he is amazing!  Really really helpful and gave us loads of advice and his time. It really is a lovely hotel and your central to pretty much everything , just don't buy anything from there;4
Excellent hotel enjoyed our stay ,large room for guests with mobility problems,only problem was with the buffet breakfast,food excellent but no help for guests with disabilities  but hotel staff where very pleasant and helpful,would stay again;4
I'm a business owner in California and love coming to New York to check out products. I've stayed in many hotels before and more or less they have been good, but they have pretty much put a toll on my wallet. The empire hotel is affordable, and is in such a great location that many hotels can not beat. Zunachy the amazing girl at the front desk who checked me in helped me get a free upgrade and helped me all throughout my trip with a huge smile. Seriously this young lady's smile made my day. I will defiantly recommend this hotel to friends.;4
We stayed for one night for a company party and booked a room on the executive floor. This hotel is wonderful, nicely appointed, and the staff is great. I was thanks over and over for my loyalty status, which was nice.   The continental breakfast is located in the main restaurant and was GREAT! One of the best continental breakfasts Iâve had at the Hilton brands. Iâm not sure if this is attend brand-wide, but I sure hope so.   The room was nice and spacious. The bathroom was well done and quite large. The reason for my 4/5 review is the desk in the room was rusty. The legs and coated in rust. Not what I want to see when I pay $300/night. Additionally, the shower head was terrible. It sprayed all directions and all the settings were piercing-hard sprays. Not what I would call;4
Just across road from Lincoln Centre and near many attractions. Comfy bed and adequate room. Choice of cold buffet breakfast or full cooked. Good bars in lobby and roof terrace. Pleasant helpful staff.;4
The hotel had been chosen for me so I wasn't sure what to expect given the reviews. The staff was fine -- not overly friendly but they did their job. The hotel is a bit dark, especially the hallways, which have a quirky 1970s wallpaper. The room as well was dark, but not so bad when I raised the curtains to their maximum. While I first felt cheated by having in inward facing room, I reframed and realized this would be much quieter than having a room facing the street. I slept with the window open about 6 inches...  The room itself was functional -- not large though not small. Though it was dated, it was clean (which is my main concern). The bathroom as well was small, but functional. It served my needs -- the towels were more than decent and amenities were better than average.;4
After quite a bit of research on line, I decided to stay at Days Broadway Hotel. I was very happy with my choice. The room had two double beds and was a large room compared to others I had looked at. It seems that New York standards are different than other vacation destinations. The rooms are smaller and the cost is higher, but hey, its New York! Things are more expensive there. The hotel was nice and clean, housekeeping came everyday and made the beds and left fresh towels. They will not touch your personal items so if you leave anything on the bed it will not get made. My son left his laptop on the bed one day and that bed was not made but the other bed was made as usual. The location was great. Not too far from anything, but far enough to be away from the noisy areas. Our;4
Hotel was reall good, booked a king room and my girlfriend loved the decor! Bathroom in particular had a great walk in shower. The hotel reception and bar area is really nice and it is good to have a water fountain with the city being so expensive for people from the UK! The location is top drawer being in between times square and central park it is a great starting point for the trip. Meant we barely had to use the subway for what we wanted to do except when going to lower manhattan/brooklyn.   The only disappointing bit is that we booked the room which included wifi yet the signal was so poor we had none the whole trip. it was the last room 412 on the fourth floor so must of been too far from the router.   Anyway, a great hotel at a reasonabale rate, would definitely return.;4
The Wyndham was a pleasant hotel, yes itâs dated in some aspects but the whole hotel was spotlessly clean,and all the staff were so pleasant and could not do enough for you. Anyone wanting the perfect base to stay in NYC should not look any further than the Wyndham New Yorker.;4
Excellent customer service and centrally located. Room was chic, clean and comfortable. Only negative was that the bathroom light was out. We should have called down to the front desk, but we just dealt with it.;4
Stayed at the New Yorker in June, travelling with a friend. She stays at the New Yorker periodically for work travel, so we picked this at her recommendation. I typically like smaller, boutiquey hotels, but this was a spur-of-the-moment getaway on a budget, and we did get a comparatively great price. The stay was a mixed bag of good and bad. The Good:  Super convenient location (nowhere better if you're coming for an event at MSG!)  Surrounded by relatively cheap food options (TickTock Diner was an awesome, easy choice)  Security was excellent and staff friendly  The Bad: Arrived from JFK around 5pm, and room was not yet available. That's a bit annoying, as it's 2 hours after check-in time, but not a big deal. We went out for a bit and returned to get ready for dinner, and room;4
Use an electric scooter and found this hotel to be comfortable and bathroom large and accessible. asked manager to install hand rails in shower to make it more safe. Hope this happens otherwise folks can fall if they lose their balance. Doormen (Julien and Said) were exceptionally helpful and I needed to use side door as front entrance has steps. also  accessible taxi did not arrive to take me to airport even though I requested it 24 hours in advance. The doorman hustled to find me an accessible taxi and got to airport just on time to catch my plane. Thank you...Doormen were all wonderful and compassionate professionals!;4
I enjoyed a 3 night stay here using it a as a base to explore Manhattan for 3 days  before attending a work conference on long island.  My impression of check in and the lobby were very good. Staff were friendly, no issue with check in formalities and the lobby etc is very grand.  The room was a queen size double and perfectly adequate. It was clean and everything in it's place. No particular view from my window but this did not bother me. Only issue I had was with the safe as I could not get it working. I called reception and they sent someone up promptly to take a look. I had noticed some reviews saying that the rooms were noisy  (noise transfer through walls etc.) I experienced no issue with this. The room next door I think was bigger than mine and had a family with young;4
This hotel has been more of a hit than a miss lately and I am so happy about that. Although i did experience a lil discomfort @ the front desk with a staff member, the hotel itself is really nice and even had someone reach out to me afterwards asking how my stay was. I really enjoyed my night as I use it mostly to sleep and rest and their beds are quite comfortable. I always request for placement at a higher floor because they tend to be more quiet and half the time they do give me just that.;4
I'll preface my comments be saying I'm not overly picky with hotel rooms. My wife is another story. Went for a weekend with friends. The service at this hotel was outstanding. Our suite was ready way before check-in but when we got there my wife was bummed as there was no bath tub. She's high maintenance, what can I say? One call to the front desk and they hooked us up with another one immediately that had a tub and we were set. The suites are the size of a normal smallish hotel room anywhere else but hey that's NY. The bed, however, was great. We slept very well. The showers all have the stupid half open set-up which I just makes no sense. When looking closely, you could tell a full door used to be there but they decided to be 'trendy'. What's not trendy is having to cover the;4
When we arrived at this hotel our travel agents got the year wrong for our booking but the check in assistant linda was absolutely fantastic with helping us get sorted out. The room was good size, the bathroom was basic but done the job.;4
Stayed at the Empire for 4 days. Rooms tend to be small but the service is big.  Door staff phenomenally helpful getting you a cab or SUV in mere seconds.  Roof top bar a must.  Location sensational with restaurants, drugstore etc close at hand.  The foyer and decor is just wonderful.;4
Rooms are a little small and bathroom tiny but it's expected in New York! Fast and friendly check in. Tick Tock diner great for breakfast and cake. Brilliant location beside Madison Square Gardens and a few minutes walk from Macy's. We had a view of the Empire State Building from our room. Planning to revisit soon!;4
We booked in here at 4am because the hotel we were staying in was terrible. The staff were lovely and gave us a free room upgrade. We had a great corner room. Watch out for the the $25 per day charge for internet and phone calls though! The Tick Tock diner is great.;4
Very friendly staff. Great location (Lincoln Centre, Musea, Central Park, Times Square), very good beds, very good wifi, good fitness. Airco performed great during the heat wave, but was a bit noisy (probably because of the exceptional circumstances).;4
Overall the hotel is clean and staff are nice. Your in the heart of NYC, so donât expect it to be cheap and donât expect the rooms to be of a nice size.  The only disappointing part of our stay was that we had to pay $20 to store our bags for a few hours before we left for our flight. Personally I think this should be free and included with your stay price like the majority of other hotels.   Other than that, it was nice and I would consider staying again if the price was right.;4
Michelene (sp) and Miguel were able to put me in a corner suite after I let them know about problems with my first room (funky smelling shower, problems with TV and wireless). Kudos to them for making it right.;4
is an excellent choice for travelers visiting New York, offering a luxurious environment along with many services designed to enhance your stay.  Close to most of New York's landmarks, such as Love Sculpture (0.8 km) and Manhattan Skyline (1.1 km), Hotel New York Marriott Marquis is a great destination for tourists.;4
"Tesla: talented scientist, lived at the New Yorker for the last 10 years of his life - there's a small museum downstairs.  For the hotel; interesting art deco decoration, definitely had charm although the flip side is that the rooms aren't particularly modern. OK though. Seemed odd that we had to pay an additional $20 /night service charge - maybe this is standard in NY?  Location is good for Times Sq, hop on/off buses, highline (recommended), empire state. Plenty of places to eat around plus the 24 hour diner in the hotel. General: not perfect, but we liked it";4
We returned today from a 4 night stay in the Empire. We found it to be a lovely hotel in a great location. 2 minute walk from the subway, and a 5 minute walk from Central Park. The staff are all helpful and friendly, and were quick to offer directions and advice. I would have given the hotel 5, but the air con unit leaked onto my boyfriend's case, causing several items of clothing to get wet. We informed reception and they dry cleaned the items at no cost on the same day, with many apologies and smiles. The rooms aren't huge, but big enough for what you need - I would hope you wouldn't be spending too much time in your room if you're a tourist in NYC! The mini bar IS expensive as everyone says, but just don't use it. There's a Starbucks on the corner that opens at 5.30am (if;4
The location of the hotel is great. It's right beside the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway. A few blocks from the heart of Times Square so not quite as noisy.  The air con in the rooms was great. The rooms were a good size but the beds were a little small for 2 adults and the room could use some extra storage like a drawer by the night stand. Close to subways and Times Square and Central Park.;4
Just got back from 5 days in NYC. My teenage son and I stayed at the Empire. The best thing about it is the location. It is right across from Lincoln Center, close to Columbus Circle and the Central Park, and a subway ride to everything else. The rooms are small and the bathrooms even smaller, but not unusual for New York. The funny thing about the bathroom is that only half of the shower staff is contained so no matter how hard I tried, I soaked the bathroom every time I took a shower. I think they will deal with this when they do their planned remodel. Also, the air conditioner in our first room was quite noisy and knocked when the cold air kicked in. I found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful. We requested an upgrade to two doubles and they gave us one at a modest;4
I was in a double room with a friend on the third floor, no elevator so quite difficult to carry up our luggage. The room was nice and bathrooms were okay. Wifi was available but not free. Good for a weekend, no more.;4
We read the reviews which were not all positive but the location was good so we gave it a go.  Glad we did as all round it was a good experience. The staff were friendly and helpful and the location is great for Universal and City walk. Te pool area was great and we enjoyed some great winter sunshine. The only  Nigel was the noise from some other rooms, the walls are  a bit thin. That said, great room, comfy bed and very clean. Good all round experience, would go again..;4
Excellent service  from MS Cecile Eugenio at the front desk who was bent backwards to make our stay as pleasant as possible.;4
Great location at the times Square, less than 5 minutes walking from the main street and stores in the times square, helpful staff, but has no free wifi in the rooms (only if you pay). Just offer wifi in the main lobby...;4
I stayed in March for three nights and loved this hotel. I did have an issue with my room, but the hotel kindly refunded me one of the nights a few weeks after I got home. My room had a problem with the heating, but it was unusually cold in NYC that weekend and the only other room available had the same problem. Many blankets later I was a cozy to sleep, but the room was too cold to sit in. Anyway, the hotel management was fantastic and followed up with my feedback. This is the kind of service we want from places we stay, so I will go back. Location is great, decor unique and the vibe is sweet! Go The Jane!!!!!;4
The hotel is in a very good  location , away from the midtown activity and noise.  Regarding the noise, if looking at Lincoln Center, the view is nice , but the nightly noise level is not good.  Higher the floor the better, but still an issue.  For those on business needing desk and work space, electrical outlets are very limited.  there are a number of small restaurants on Broadway, a short walk, that are very good and less expensive than mid town prices;4
Me and my brother stayed there for 4nights it not far from time square just a short cab ride away .I am thinking about booking for next year. The room was just the right size and the service was spot on. ....;4
Loved this Art Deco hotel, all staff from Reception, Concierge & Domestics are very helpful (cheery Maggie was very patient in cleaning our room when convenient to us).  Public transport close by and Tick Tock Diner is great for breakfast before heading out for the day and a much needed cup of tea & cheesecake before retiring for the night.;4
I really liked this place small rooms it was a rooming house for sailors the bunk bed rooms are small and you share a bath the place is clean and the price was right I paid 59.00 + tax they have bathrobe and slippers in the room would stay here again it's right next to the Hudson river also stayed the weekend stayed on the 3rd floor and no problem with noise from the club;4
I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of July with my girlfriend.  We booked a standard room and were allocated one on the 1st floor. The room was very nice and clean if a little small (which is what we expected) however, looking out of the window all we saw and HEARD was the air conditioning unit. We asked to be moved and were moved to the 7th floor where we could still hear it and were looking out on it. We complained again and were told that all the standard rooms looked out on this area.   We had no choice but to upgrade our room which cost us $350.  The new room was excellent and money well spent, it was very big and looked out over the Lincoln Centre.   All this aside the hotel is good and we enjoyed our stay once we had a nicer room. We tended to get used to the good;4
Always scary booking budget hotels like this, as Forrest Gump's mom said 'you never know what you're gonna get'.  Pleasantly surprised.  We got a great deal peak summer season 4 nights end of July beginning of August.  Was very wary as the price we got was so low.  The room was very small, just enough for a bed and small hutch for one suitcase, a small metal tv stand.  Thought there was no bathroom as we opened the room door but behind the door was the decent bathroom.  AC worked just enough to keep the room comfortable, not quite cool but comfortable enough to sleep.  Bed was a bit hard but okay.  The first 3 nights of 4 the elevator was broken and we were on the fifth floor which is a bit of a pain after walking most of the day, again tolerable.  It is a small quaint hotel,;4
The hotel was comfortable. It could have been a little cleaner. Great Location!;4
We stayed here for 8 days and couldn't have been happier. If you are looking to stay in your hotel room all day or in the hotel itself and lounge around a pool then this place is not for you. However, if you are looking for a basic room for a reasonable price to use as your base for what you plan to do in New York then the Morningside will fit your bill. When we checked in we were told because of the length of our stay they would try and upgrade us at not charge when a bigger room was available.  Within two days we were offered to upgrade (we were in a 3 person room)but chose not to because we were comfortable.  The rooms all have fridges and there is cooking facilities on all floors.   We shared a bath but never had a problem getting a shower or using the restroom. Very good;4
Stayed here 4 nights with my wife and two teenage daughters.Location is perfect,right next to the Lincoln Center.We prefer this location over Times Square.Hotel is above average.Try to win it on Priceline, like we did and it becomes an excellent property.Would certainly return.;4
We would totally recommend the hotel. New York weather was amazing (June 2017). The roof top area was great for a little time out. The pool is more a plunge pool but it was perfect during the heatwave.;4
The Jane is a very cool-looking and affordable hotel in NYC. Know what you're getting into as the rooms are tiny, and for most of the rooms, there are no bathrooms but instead, shared bathrooms at the end of the hall. My room and the bathrooms were spotlessly clean, and I hardly ever saw another guest in the bathroom over four days. The staff is nice, and the whole place had a cool vibe. You can't beat the price in Manhattan.;4
I stayed at this hotel for business and it was okay.  The hotel was very standard, no complaints.  This would have been a great location had I been going to Universal so I would highly recommend it if that is your purpose.  It was an easy walk to Universal City Walk where you can choose from a number of common chain restaurants.  I don't plan to stay here again as I prefer a location with more unique and interesting restaurants within walking distance, but the hotel itself was fine.;4
I enjoyed my stay at the Empire Hotel. It was busy, but there wasn't any problems with excess noise, despite the club on the roof. Hotel rooftop pool was awesome, once we figured out how to get up there (use the elevator when you first walk in)! The room was small, but clean. L'Occitane toiletries, and a poor view (the wall), but it was a great location!! It was literally across the street from the Lincoln Center and the subway stop. I wouldn't pay the going rate for it, but I would recommend it to everyone!;4
Room just average but view very nice. Very good training facilities included. Staff ok. Cleaning good. Three guys in a room with just two double beds... Not what we expected but we didn't search facts before trip so we blame ourselves... Read everything very thorough before booking room because of extra costs and hidden costs.  Dont forget the hotels own little $27/day charge...!!!  Perfectly situated at the 34th for the first time turist with a lot to see within walking distance. For example Madison Square Garden (100 mtr), Empire State Building and Times Square. Penn station, which is kind of a hub, is right outside the door with direct line up- and downtown and one station away is a big bus terminal.   Penn station is also perfect for JFK with several ways of coming from and;4
Good value and excellent location for attending events at Lincoln Center, also close to excellent dining places as well as Central Park. Very close access to subway and Warner Center also a plus. Pleasant stay.;4
Unable to connect to internet. Worked for one hour to try to connect in room. Could not connect  to get work done. Went into hallway and got access . Lost immediately after coming in from Hallway. This was the only frustrating element of my stay.;4
As a,family of 4 we booked the New Yorker for 7 nights. On arrival we found the room to be very cramped but accepted this as New York city standards. We booked via Expedia. They asked for a review and my husband submitted that the staff were fantastic, hotel public areas amazing but the room was very small for a family of 4 for 7 nights. Next thing we knew the manager, Kader, was looking for us. She upgraded us to a suite with late check out on our last day free of charge. Amazingly well handled and most unexpected. Kader had a,warm friendly, sunny personality and made our holiday experience more special.;4
Excellent airport hotel.  Stayed multiple times.  Great if transiting at LAX or have things to do nearby.  About 30 - 40 minutes to downtown LA.  Check in can be busy at times.  Room is big.  Good soundproofing although walls are a little thin.  Limited restaurants.  Food is pretty good although breakfast is disappointing.  For example, have to slice and toast your own bagel.;4
Stayed here as a family just prior to July 4, perfect location for the universal studios experience, 5 minute walk from the hotel or take the free courtesy bus, nice quiet pool areas and the staff were great, big clicks to Linda on the front desk. Only downside was the wait time for lifts due to upgrading the elevators. Studio view room is the hot tip if travelling with kids;4
"For the price, this was a great place to stay.  I only stayed here one night, but I wanted a nice place somewhere in Manhattan, fairly cheap but not a hostel, close to the subway, clean, and safe.  I also wanted something that made me think ""New York"".  And that's exactly what I got. If you are looking for a room of the size and comfort level usually found in chain hotels by the airport, this is not going to fit the bill.  For one thing, yes, you have to share the bathroom.  The bed is small, and the staff is pleasant but not willing to fulfill your every desire.  The building is a maze of hallways and you will need to remember how to get back to the front door.  Parking is probably out of the question- we took the train, so I don't know anything about that.  You want a";4
Pleasant base for weekend sightseeing and Broadway. Bit steep for in room coffee. Plenty of coffee shops nearby though with a better cup for the same price. Junior Suite beds very comfortable and we enjoyed the quiet of the floor after spending the day on our feet sightseeing.;4
"My family and I only stayed one night. We were in town for a funeral. At the last minute, I had to add an additional guest to our room. Rather than reserve an additional room, the hotel clerk gave me a large suite at no additional charge. Great service and location and shops nearby; across the street from Lincoln Center. I would definitely recommend. Couldn't beat the value for a Manhattan hotel stay.";4
Hey ya'll!  I actually stayed at Morningside Inn for a total of six months while I was attending school in NYC.  I must say that at first I had my reservations about the place, but soon considered it home.  Patrick (hotel manager) was amazing!  He's super friendly and helpful when needed.  I found the staff to also share the same friendliness.  The only thing that was a little upsetting the whole time I was there was the fact that the phones were out of commission a lot.  It became a little frustrating. But all in all, I felt completely safe there, no major problems with other attendents, great location and would recommend this place to anyone that wants to save money to spend on in that amazing city!;4
"I have to admit, after reading all the up and down reviews about this place I was terrified! I was expecting a run-down flea-bitten roach-invested hell hole! But for about $80/night on the Upper West Side, I couldn't afford anything else on the island. I was, by all accounts, terrified.  But, really, it was nothing like that. Is it a four star Marriott with all the luxuries and high-style life? No... but is it awful? No. It was okay. Simple as that. It was adequate. And for the location and value, it was fantastic. Especially since it is New York, and we were only in the room for a few hours every night anyway.  We had no problems with the staff; they let us drop our bags off before check-in (then let us check in early a few hours later), and were completely helpful and friendly";4
When we first arrived at The New Yorker I have to admit we were very unsure. The lady who first greeted us at the front desk was more interested in the other staff members around her than ourselves and we felt very unwelcome after a long 7 hour flight. When we arrived at our room, it was absolutely tiny and could only just fit a double bed and a desk. It was also absolutely freezing and very near the elevators, and I knew I couldnât sleep there for a whole week.  After phoning down to the front desk, a lovely lady called Krystal said she would change the rooms over and we were told to stay in the current room for the night, leave our luggage there the next day and when we returned from a day out, the luggage would be moved to another room for us. When we woke up we also found a;4
I came to New York as a young, female solo traveller and I found The Jane to be everything and more than I could have hoped for.  The building and decor are amazing. Yes, the bedrooms are tiny, but who needs much space? The bathrooms were clean. I was only there two nights but in the time I think I only saw about one other person in the bathrooms at the same time, so sharing really wasn't an issue.  I have already recommended The Jane to other members of my family. It's in a great location and I loved the quirky feel and laidback atmosphere.  Thanks for a great stay.;4
Good location, cheap hotel pay, near subway, restaurant available , convenient transport available from hotel to JFK airport .  Will defenitely come back;4
Recently got back from the Wyndham New Yorker, great hotel. Very central, less than 10 minute walk from Time Square. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and spacious and staff were very friendly. There is a safe in the room to store your money, passports ect and also an iron and ironing board which is always a bonus. The Tik Tok restaurant attached to the hotel is definitely worth a visit, the food is amazing. All in all, a very good holiday and would definitely stay here again due to its location and cleanliness.;4
Great location - food options, public transportation, sights, and entertainment are all a short walk away. Nice fitness center - surprisingly large for any hotel, especially one in NYC. Accommodating staff - helpful when you need them. Have stayed at this property at least a half-dozen times and will undoubtedly be back here again in the future.;4
Travelled from Ireland to LA for 10 nights and booked the Hilton for the duration of our stay. The location is great for universal and only a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station! So canât fault on the location. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The only downside is the hotels restaurant! We ate here twice and didnât like it either of the times. Although our waiter was one of the nicest people we have came across on our trip to LA! Offering us advice and help if we ever needed it on our holiday, the hotel also offers a shuttle bus to universal city walk which we took advantage of for dinner!;4
This was not planned as we had a sudden incident to where we had to find a place to stay. The reception staff at the hotel was more than kind and helpful in offering an early check in as we had to be ready at noon. The room was clean and the breakfast was good. Staying here was a needed breath of fresh air. Thanks to the staff at the Hollywood Hotel. You made the difference!;4
We stayed at the New Yorker this past Monday for one night and it was a beautiful hotel. We arrived earlier than the check in time and the person checking us in was nice enough to find a room that we could check into earlier. The only real complaint I had was... I asked him if it was the same kind of room that we reserved online( a suite with queen bed). Wanted to make sure it had a separate bedroom because we were going with my daughter and her boyfriend and wanted privacy. I had called the hotel prior to make sure it had a separate bedroom and was told yes. He told me that it was indeed a suite but there was no separate bedroom ...no door to the room separating the bedroom from living space. He said of all the rooms in the hotel, there was no separate bedroom. I was super;4
The Windsor Hotel is a 2 star hotel, so I wasn't expecting much. The room was big enough for 2 people with a safe and a good size bed (which was comfy enough for a hotel bed). The shower was no problem, although the tap started to leak at one point but that was sorted out by the Hotel quickly. I only wanted a room to sleep in and dump all my stuff in so it was great for that (it had a TV but we only had it on in the morning as we were getting ready).  The location was great, it's in Chinatown and not far from Little Italy. It was really nice to be staying in an area that wasn't at all tourist-y, surrounded by locals. I can see how it might not be every tourist's ideal place to stay, but as someone who didn't want to have the normal generic tourist experience I loved it.   There;4
The Facility was very nice. The staff was excellent especially the doormen. The room was very clean. The location was perfect. The only problem. Our room was facing the street and the noise was almost unbearable. If we stay her again we will request an inside or backside room.;4
Nicole at the front desk is everyoneâs must-go-to girl. She is kind, thoughtful, caring and wants guests to have a wonderful experience!  The room she assigned me is fabulous!  Breakfast canât be beat, either. The housekeeping staff are thorough and friendly!;4
I appreciated the housekeeping staff who did a good job of cleaning the room and the people who make sure only hotel residents come in the elevators.  The business room was just what I needed and the gym was great!  The rooms are small but it seems that's what one should expect in downtown.  The rooms DO NOT have a fridge or microwave both of which would have been very nice.  At check-in I was charged an additional $40 resort fee on-top of the resort fee charged when I reserved the room.  Parking is $50 a night, there's a spot for 2-3cars to pull-over and unload before parking kitty-corner to the hotel.  There are lots of places to eat with-in walking distance and it's not a difficult walk to Times Square, the Empire State Building or the 9/11 site.  Possible changes: fans in;4
"Great for single travellers on a tight budget who don't want to compromise on location, you're just ten minutes walk from the A, C, E and L trains at 8th Ave/14th St subway station and a tree-lined street or two from the delights of the West Village (Sex & The City's Magnolia Bakery is very near), and the designer boutiques of the Meat Packing District.  The Jane has bags of West Village shabby chic charm. The rooms, or ""cabins"", are certainly small, but so well designed that I never felt cramped. They're very well appointed with air conditioning, fan, flat screen TV/DVD, iPod dock, safe and more than adequate storage.  And with the whole of NYC waiting outside, you're not going to be spending much time awake in your room in any case.  Some may baulk at the thought of using";4
small room , however comfortable and all you really need if you are out all day. Rooms need more sound proofing , if that is at all possible in NY.  Overall I'will say very good.   Front desk representatives could be a bit more friendly and explain hotel amenities , like the use of rooftop area and lobby bar hours .;4
"Came here for my girlfriends 21st. Requested a bottle of champagne for the room on arrival and we're told we could have the bottle on the house, this we were delighted about and appreciated the generosity very much! Our iron did not work and requested a new one, 40 minutes later we still did not have one so had to go to our restaurant reservation with an un-ironed shirt. Other than that, still had a nice stay, would recommend the diner ""tick tock"" attatched to the hotel for breakfast and lunch and were surprised with a view of Empire State Building which made for great viewing when jet lag hits at 5AM!";4
Me and my partner had chosen to stay in the New Yorker based on a recommendation from her grandmother. The price was very reasonable for a stay in central Manhattan and the room surpassed my expectations. There only issue we had was with the shower. The temperature was hard to control either being too hot or too cold. The hotel itself was nicely placed, across the road from Penn station and Madison Square garden as well as only being down the road from the empire state building. If I were to ever visit New York again I wouldn't hesitate to stay in the New Yorker.;4
I was hesitant to book after previous negative reviews. However, glad I did! The room had a great view o Licoln center, the staff was great, and the breakfast delicious. The heat was on the fritz, but it didnât get cold at all bc we were in a higher floor. Check it out for yourself and make up your own mind.;4
The room was small but more than adequate for sleeping purposes. We had a second floor room, no view but it was quiet which ended up being more important than I first thought. The neighborhood was great with several neighborhood eateries /stores nearby. We didn't see much of the staff but that wasn't why we were there to start with, so I can't really give an opinion on the staff except to say that the room was clean, the beds comfortable and the staff I did come in contact with were pleasant. On the negative... no coffee! I would stay here again.;4
Fantastic location. Easy pleasant walk to the universal studio, or catch free shuttle buses. We had an executive room. It was on high floor facing the Harry porter ride. The view was very impressive day and night. However there was no other perk for the executive rooms besides high floor and free breakfasts. Even the breakfast included was continental. $10 extra for full buffet. I thought this was very stingy from the hotel management, thus the 4 star. Otherwise a very pleasant stay.;4
The best part about this hotel is the location, itâs close to all the shops, not far from the likes of the Empire State Building and has easy access to the subway. Our room was small and a little dated but it didnât bother us. The bed was very comfy and the hairdryer provided was very good also! Having the Tick Tock diner in the lobby was ideal and I would definitely recommend visiting there. The doorman Frankie was very helpful with organising taxis to the airport and the employees at left luggage were also very friendly.   A couple of negatives unfortunately. The first being the check in process, the woman wasnât friendly at all and acted like we were a huge inconvenience. Also, you have to pay to leave luggage at the hotel when you have checked out. We left 2 suitcases and 2;4
Room and kitchen are serviceable, basic, nothing fancy, some very minor defects like knobs missing from drawers and tiny bathroom. A/c is fine, cannot beat the location!  Nice lobby, as long as it's not filled with Gymboree kids and their nannies.;4
We could not have had a better place to stay for our large family: incredibly good rates for NYC, the charm of the neighborhood (with places like the Garden of Eden foodstore), and the funkiness of the old building. But it's about people, isn't it, and Patrick, the manager, made our stay. He is a host through and through, both gracious and generous. And funny. Thanks for adding greatly to our time in New York!;4
The hotel is in an excellent location for the sub-way, restaurants, the park and other local attractions. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The bathroom is small but not too small. The shower is large with good water pressure.  The roof top bar has great views and good drinks. Happy hour is the best value but also very crowded. We love the new dÃ©cor in the lobby and in the rooms. The room attendants were quick to respond to requests for additional items for the room. The staff was very friendly and gracious. This is our second stay here and we have enjoyed our stay both times.;4
My husband and I went for our first anniversary ( he proposed in New York City). We loved the location and the rooftop pool area was a great to relax. The concierge even sent up champagne for our anniversary. They also gave us a room with a beautiful view of lincoln center.  Overall it was a great stay and we will be coming here again next year!;4
I was really worried about staying here since I only read the reviews after paying for the room.  We got a room on the ground floor with courtyard balcony.  We didn't have any sound disturbance at all during our stay. All the towels were changed frequently and room was always cleaned.  Breakfast OK, there was enough choice of bagels, croissants, rolls, cereals, freshly prepared waffles, fruit, toast. I know that you have to $9 per day for car parking but this in line or less than other hotels I called.  The staff seemed OK and there is internet access available for a small fee.  I thought this place was alright to stay at.;4
Myself and a friend stayed here 8th through to 12th March.  First time at this hotel but not NYC.  Had read many reviews of great location and helpful staff.  Emily and Mohammed had been praised.  Our TA made an error with our booking when we had thought we booked a double double (twin beds) but they had only booked a classic double.  We had been advised before our trip that we had received a free upgrade to a room with a view, and this was when the error had been noticed.  I contacted the hotel and liaised with Emily.  She was very helpful and agreed to upgrade us to a double double for a fee, which we were happy to pay and had discussed in advance.  Moving onto arrival where Mohammed checked us in.  I advised of the error and my correspondence with Emily only to be berated and;4
Rooms are spacious and clean.  Close to a lot of Restaurants. They have a nice rooftop Restaurant.Service was good and courteous.  Wifi was free and fast.  I didn't like the $5 bottle water they were charging.  Overall nice place to stay in the City.;4
Finding a great hotel, with descent prices in a good location in New York, is no small feat. For the perfect ' girlfriend' weekend or a quick get a way while catching a show- the Empire Hotel fits pretty darn well!  Having stayed there years ago, I recall smallish rooms, some with views that look towards the river and bathrooms that didn't allow exactly spell modern. But they've remodeled(not sure of the year) and the rooms now are soothing and comfortable- albeit a bit small- with modern bathrooms and some luxury  touches.  Frette towels and sheets, a good comforter and a mattress that allows rest for weary shoppers at days end ... add to the  benefits this hotel provides.  For Lincoln Center activities, you cannot touch this location and if you wish to shop... whether at;4
Nice hotel, well located for tourists, but most of all the staff was very efficient, helpful and friendly.  Said and Jalal especially gave us some nice tips and helped with the logistics, as we were on a business trip, with meetings to organize.  Do not hesitate to have a drink at the bar, where the barman will tell you everything he knows about wines and spirits!;4
Value for money, especially since the hotel is located in the heart of a vibrant neighbourhood in close proximity to Times Square and Central Park. A special mention goes out to Gina at the reception for the great hospitality and speedy check in process.;4
Our family of 3 decided to stay at the Hollywood Hotel for our 1 week trip to LA. We booked early so we had a 50% discount of the regular price. The free breakfast was one of the biggest highlights, as it offered many different filling options! There was a huge selection (around 7 or 8) different types of cereals, bagels, breads, tater tots, and you could also request the chef for eggs cooked in which ever way you like (scrambled, omelettes, poached etc.), as well as waffles (including flavours like chocolate, strawberry, and cinnamon switched between the days). Breakfast was served from 6:30 to 10:30, which was more than enough time for us to grab an early bite and head on out with our bellies full.   The room itself was very clean and was decently sized (we got one room with 2;4
I have stayed at the Empire Hotel several times while in New York on business. Location is a real plus with great restaurants within walking distance, shopping, museums... The rooms are clean and very comfortable. The front desk concierge was extremely helpful and the staff very attentative. I have stayed in several other hotels while on business trips, this is my far my most favorite.;4
We have just returned from a stay at this lovely hotel.  We had a city view bedroom on the 4th floor which had a great view and was very comfortable.  The bathroom is a little small, but fully functional and the shower is amazing!  The hotel is in a great location and ideally situated for Central Park and is about a 15 minute walk to the top of the park and the start of the shops etc.  There is a large shopping mall about 10 mins away too.  We had breakfast in the rooftop bar one morning, which is tasty and served buffet style.  This is quite expensive but worth it for the view. This would be lovely in the summer when the open air rooftop bar and pool is open.  The staff are all really friendly and extremely helpful, but the biggest thank you needs to go to AJ who helped us when;4
We were not too happy with the original room we booked for 8 days. But, after our second night the Manager on duty was very kind to upgrade us to a much nicer, quieter  & bigger room free of charge. The hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating to us. So, we were very appreciative with that. This made our stay there pleasant and comfortable. Itâs in a wonderful location.;4
The hotel itself was great.   Room was very comfortable.  Not large in size, but had basically what I needed and felt comfortable in it.   Hotel had a nice exercise room and even had an outdoor pool (you have to walk out back through the parking lot to get to it, but is fenced off and comfortable to be at).  The parking is expensive, but there is street parking available right in front of the hotel and right next to it which you can park overnight for free.  Otherwise I recall it costing around $20 a day to park, and street parking you'd have to pay a meter for during the day.  Note, street parking starts at 9amish where you'd have to pay so if you're not leaving early would have to watch that.  Breakfast buffet is great, and Hugo made great omelets in the morning (I found out;4
I stayed at the Jane Hotel in mid-May 2013.  I was very pleased with my stay there.  My two main criteria when looking for a hotel in New York were price and location.  The Jane delivers on both.  The Jane is located right in the Meat Packing District.  Itâs a 5 minute walk away from Greenwich Village, and 10-15 minutes away from SoHo.  You can walk to the High Line linear park in less than 5 minutes.  The hotelâs lobby is very tastefully decorated.  The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.  And the rooms were clean and well-kept.  My spouse and I chose a bunk-bed cabin room with a shared bathroom (the cheapest option).  The room was smaller than I thought (more on that later), but adequate.  This was my first time staying in a hotel with shared bathrooms, so I wasnât sure;4
I had such a good time at the Jane. It's just a cool place to be. The rather spartan conditions (teeny tiny rooms with teen-ier beds and shared bathrooms) were more than made up for by the utter charm of the place and the staff. CafÃ© Gitane has good coffee and food, as well as decent drinks. The staff was most friendly.  And, you really just can't beat the location or the price.   Not for every traveler, but perfect for me.;4
3 of us stayed in the New Yorker for 4 nights from 27th April 2017, for my 50th. We stayed here 6 years ago for my sister's 40th Birthday, loved it so much, so came back. Our initial impression was of disappointment. It is a gorgeous, impressive hotel but beginning to look a bit shabby. Putting that aside, we had a totally amazing stay here!! The staff are all superb, apart from the miserable barmaid. Everyone bent over backwards to make our stay there perfect and to make my 50th memorable. If you need help with anything, ask John in transportation and tell him the witches from England sent you ð;4
This is a historical hotel at Penn Station. Renovated some years ago it is a bit worn but still very nice. Great staff. We got a suite with cash+points for $200 per night with a great view. Breakfast is not included.;4
Great place to stay.  The shuttle works to universal city walk/studios is a great idea.  Gets very crowded after 9:00 pm. We walked back to the hotel (no more than 10 mins.)  Rooms were well kept and service was what you would expected.  Food as a little high priced but I thought it was worth it.;4
Overall rated this well... let me start with the not so goods - noise... it's NYC and it's an older building so no double glazing so bring ear plugs as takes a few nights to get used to noise..... we couldn't sleep two nights in so went down on middle of night and they kindly moved us... great service.. - water... three of the eight mornings we were there we had to have cold shower... we were with group of 14 and the first day it happened they said only small group had been impacted but 13 of us had cold shower so think it was bigger than they realised and maybe most people hadn't said anything (we were only ones in our group that asked)... we didn't bother telling them after that about the other two days... - normal rooms and even the ones with a view and a bit more upgraded;4
"Love this hotel...only issue is the size of the rooms...when checking in ""Jose"" said we had been upgraded.  When we arrived in our room, I swear it was by far the smallest room I had ever stayed in (even smaller than european rooms).  Did I originally book a closet and then was upgraded to this room?  Anyways, we just stayed in the room and made the most of it.  I will say that after the initial shock of the room size, it kinda grew on us and enjoyed the rest of the trip. With this said, I will say that I'll be returning to this location, now that I know what to expect.";4
The staff where every welcoming and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.  I had an issue with the safe twice and both times they fixed it straight away.  The room was cold when I came back from a days sightseeing, but just but the heater on and within ten minutes it was lovely and warm.  The only down side was that they had painted the tiles and bath and the paint was chipping off so was not able to have a bath.  The shower pressure was a bit much too but could cope for the amount of time there.  The only thing that was missing from the room was a coffee maker or kettle that would have been nice.  Everything was provided.  It was very central.  Time square about a 10 min walk and Macyâs was about a block away and also old navy.  There was a 7/11 just around corner;4
I found the Hollywood Hotel through Expedia and they offered very good rates in my local currency so paid actual quoted price. The hotel was not in the 'heart' of Hollywood but it was a quick and easy train ride away, too easy. Plenty of eateries nearby. The complimentary breakfast was mostly continental but there was the option of scrambled eggs or an omelette cooked to order and I will really recommend the omelette. The room was clean and tidy, and well serviced daily. There was quite a bit of noise from the corridors in the morning, especially noisy children which was a little irritating. Information from the staff was well intended but not necessarily right, hence we got lost trying to find a shopping complex and ended up paying a bit for a cab. Overall, if I was going back;4
I have stayed in over 40 hotels in the last 6 months and this hotel is by far the most professionally run, and the staff is extremely competent and compassionate. The only negative is the location in Chinatown and the presence of so many rodents at night that it seemed like Ben's birthday party.;4
I like the hotel, its location, the 30ths atmosphere and settings?But at times the age of the building and the infrastructure shows.  We had a spacious corner room (great) but the cold was barely held out by the windows, we had to close the curtains to make the room a bit warmer. The room was huge  ( we are in New York remember) but unfortunately the request for a small extra table was not granted, this would have allowed us to work a bit more comfortable during the two weeks stay with two digital nomads. Lovely staff of course but the place can get fairly busy.;4
Stayed here  for  4 nights in march, the location was ideal 10 mins walk from central park  and 5 mins walk   from times square.  The hotel  has that modern feel  with lots of black and red leather  and chrome in the main lobby area,  however   the furnishings  are showing signs  of wear  and tear.  the hotel is very clean and our sheets where  changed  everyday,  however our rooms  where not serviced until quite late in the day sometimes  as late  as 3pm. the  beds  and pillows  where very comfy,  there was an iron and ironing board in  the bedrooms. The bedrooms  do not  have tea  and coffee facilities, complimentary  coffee is only available  at breakfast time.  THE HOTEL ONLY OFFERS CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST which  included fruit, yougart cereal muffin, bagels  and toast for $12;4
This was our second stay at the Ameritania, having stayed there for two weeks at Christmas 2016.  Why do you come back?  Because you are happy to do so!  This hotel is in a wonderful location adjacent to Broadway and an easy walk to Times  Square or Central Park in the other direction.  The subway is nearby and thereâs a great deli for cheap breakfasts or meals just down the road.  The rooms are comfortable although ours was a little noisy this time being on the front of the building.  Well thatâs New York anyway isnât it?   Noisy 24/7!  I did wonder if the window was double glazed though.  Apart from the fabulous location, what makes this place special for us is the staff.  Tiffany on reception was very pleasant.  She helped us out with any questions we had with regard to;4
The staff is accommodating at this LAX location.  I rented a car and had valet service throughout me 3 night stay for in and out conveniences as I attended a wedding in Malibu.  There is a public parking garage for guests to pay by day or hourly adjacent to the hotel.  Staff is extremely helpful and courteous making out stay enjoyable. I highly recommend staying at the LAX location for the mere fact that it is 5 minutes away from the airport.;4
The stay and the customer service was wonderful! The only thing that could improve is people who answer the phones. Got hung up on had to call back. Not a huge issue just annoying. Would definitely stay there again!!;4
Spent 3 nights here in early November ...The hotel is a bit dated..an unfortunate reno that strove to be hip is now sort of silly but hotel is well maintained and rooms are fine. The thing that really sets this apart is the great staff. from the moment i arrived i was greeted by a great doorman who was very friendly and walked me to the front desk where they welcomed me and had a great chat about my travels..throughout the stay staff constantly ask if i was enjoying the hotel. was everything okay etc... the location is great and the lobby bar is lively and PJ Clarks is in the building.  I would suggest asking for a high floor room..it can be noisy.  I absolutely think a stay here is a good idea.;4
The Empire Hotel is ideally located for anybody attending shows at the Lincoln Centre - just a stroll across the road. Staff was helpful in relocating us to a non-smoking room on arrival (remember to specify this when booking). Normal rooms are quite small and the bathroom is tiny, but was OK for our short stay. Concierge was very friendly and assisted in arranigng a transfer back to JFK.;4
This was our second hotel in LA. Stayed here for 4 nights as it was close to Universal. Hotel was huge and very clean. Staff were always pleasant. we had an excutive room on floor 21 over looking Universal. Room was large with 2 double beds. But i would not pay extra again for this room. The only benifit was the free breakfast and soft drinks.  But other guests were getting the free breakfast that were staying on the other floors so no idea how this worked?!!!  In all we had a good stay in this hotel BUT....... there was a convention going on and the hotel was FULL of police, security people and loads of rude business people. Our kids were shuffed and pushed on several occassions!!  Location for Universal you couldn't get better. lots of places to eat at city walk and very near;4
From the welcoming email we got from front desk agent, Minerva, asking for our arrival time until we left when Minerva was still at the front desk assisting us, our stay was perfect - great location, room with Lincoln City view, perfect Central Park weather and a spectacular opera!;4
Rooms are very clean! Maids do there job very well great eye for detail! And presentation outstanding well done! (Im housekeeping supervisor back in the UK) Bellmen so nice and welcoming, front desk reception staff where pleasant upon our arrival! Spoke with the manager before we left! He is a credit to the hotel. Thankyou for a nice stay!;4
We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel since that's not really the point. But the room was a good size and there are two attached restaurants which were perfect for nights when touring made us too tired to leave the hotel. The location is great. One block from Penn Station and about 10 mins to the base of the empire state building. I would stay again;4
Great location at my lovely NYC Upper West Side of Manhattan.  But ..it .was not a great stay and need of renovations. It's not only with old style furniture and window as so dirty but in everything. Exept location!;4
"I would definitely come back to The Jane again! West Village, on the Hudson - 7 minutes walk time from the 8th Ave./14th St. subway stop on the A line.  On recommendation from a friend who is a professional road warrior, as I am, I booked a room at The Jane in early September, 2015. The hotel has an early 1900s atmosphere which was a nice change from the modern/metropolitan feel of typical hotels nowadays, and offers a nautical atmosphere with heavy brass room keys utilizing modern electric FOBs for room entry/security with small ""ships berth"" type rooms and also has some history in that survivors of the Titanic sinking stayed here when they arrived in NY.   For clarification, The Jane offers double rooms with a bunk bed sleeping arrangement (approx. USD$150 at time of booking)";4
Stayed one night before we went to china, was good, the fitness center is excelent and the view from the top the room was ok but the breakfast for USD 29 was not great the dinner was good, the Rib-eye as very good,  suggest you go to the pool outside;4
The location of this hotel is brilliant, minutes walk from Times Square and Central Park. There is a pub next door and plenty of food places very close by.  Check-in was quick and easy, and the staff were all very friendly and knowledgable. The room was clean and comfortable.  The only critiques we have, was that the room was quite small, so there was not much room once we'd opened our suitcases. Also, there was no free wifi in the room, which is a pain when you're travelling from abroad. Wifi is only free in the lobby.  Would definitely stay here again!!!;4
Myself, my husband and my 16 year old neice had a split visit to this hotel end Nov/beg Dec and have to say first of all the location is amazing! It It is within walking distance to a lot of the big attractions like Empire State Building, Macy's and Times Square (all less than 10 mins walk) with Madison Square Garden right across the road. Subway and bus stops right outside hotel and Penn Station a 2 minute walk. The rooms are very comfortable and clean (we had a newly refurbished room for both visits). Bathrooms are fairly small but ample. Staff were friendly enough but sometimes we felt they were lacking in effort. When we returned for our second visit we were placed in a room on 7th floor which was above the diner and there seemed to be a stale food smell lingering in the;4
The room was otherwise fine but somewhere noisy--thin walls I guess.  In particularly the siund of running water in the morning.;4
NYC was the third stop on our two week trip. We wanted a good value in Manhattan. That can be hard to find. This place fit the bill. Small rooms but all we needed was a place to lay out head at the end of the day. We weren't looking for a luxurious hotel. Polite staff, helpful with getting a ride to the airport. Rooms were clean, sheets were soft and the all tile bathroom with nice shampoo and lotion was a bonus. No free wifi, but the little deli up the block was a go to for that.;4
If you want chain hotel, don't come here.  The Empire is in a great location.  On a great train line for all of the big Manhattan sights and it is within walking distance of the park and the Natural History Museum.  One issue with this hotel is that it is old school.  The room was very cool (as in cold), but the AC was dated.  The windows opened so you can hear street noise.  I arrived late and was on the 2nd floor.  So I heard all of the street noise.  The next morning, I had to go to work and asked for a change of rooms.  When I arrived back at the hotel at 6, they had moved everything to a higher floor.  That was a nice touch and they were respectful of my belongings.  My family joined me that night and it was a great time.  The lobby is old school, and a place to really hang;4
Trialfinders recommended this hotel when we booked our 5 night stay to NYC. First impressions, door men and reception staff were really friendly and helpful. Louis checked us in and upgraded our room with drink vouchers as two of us had recently celebrated big birthdays. We had junior suite to sleep 3, sofa chair and coffee table. Room was on 5th floor and view was other hotel windows. No road noise but noise of boiler just outside the window. This didn't stop us sleeping as we were on the go all day. Read reviews of bathrooms flooding but ours over splashed a bit but not too alarming. Decor a bit dated but clean and rooms were cleaned and restocked every day, domestic staff were really friendly.  Only bad thing I would say about this hotel is hotel bar, prices are really;4
Hotel was a short walk from Times Square etc but still plenty of amenities nearby.  Slight issue on check in but this was resolved promptly.  Fabulous art deco style hotel and subway right outside.  Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are a stones throw away. Room was smallish, like most but clean and maid service was great.   Only had breakfast in the diner on the last day but food was excellent and so quick.;4
I was looking for a budget accomodation for 10 days in NYC and I wanted private bathroom. I managed to find this accomodation at Morningside Inn, in a Superior room.  The room was small and the bathroom even smaller, but everything was clean and cleaned up every day at no additional cost. All the appliances worked properly (air conditioning, tv, etc.) as well as the bathroom which was ok.  I was a little disappointed when I knew that you have to pay per use to access wi-fi internet (4 bucks per 4 hours, 10 for 24 hours and so on).  The surroundings are nice. There are a lot of shops in the area and the subway it's a 5-7 minutes walk.  The overall impression is very good. It's not a luxury accomodation, but it is clean, reasonably priced, rich of services, safe and comfortable.;4
We stayed here for 1 night while attending the Dodger game. This hotel was perfect for what we needed. We came early to lounge at the pool, then checked into the room, then went to the game. The pool area is nice. The outside of the hotel and the hallways could use a make over, but rooms were somewhat recently redesigned and modern looking. Neighborhood was ok, not sure I would have walked around too much at night. We took an Uber to the game which was only about a 10-15 min ride with game traffic. Also, the room came with free breakfast which was really good and I considered a huge plus. Overall we booked this hotel because it was cheaper than others in the area and I was very happy with our stay. Would stay again if ever in the area and had a need.;4
This trip, hotel was not up to my standards. Room was very small and in need of repairs especially in the bathroom. On several of my stays, rooms were excellent as well as service. I was disappointed.;4
First and foremost, the location is great.  It's easily accessible to Amtrak, LIRR, & several subway lines.  There is a parking garage in the immediate area if you choose to drive.  The Front Desk staff was very friendly and even gave me a free upgrade to my room. There is plenty of Security staff throughout the lobby ensuring that you are a guest at the hotel. The room was a nice size, clean and very comfortable. Several people complain about the size of the room being a bit small, remember this is NYC.  All hotel rooms in NYC are going to be a bit smaller than the average size.The amazing Tick Tock diner is attached to the hotel with a great all day breakfast menu.  There lunch and dinner is pretty good there as well.  I will definitely be staying at the New Yorker during my;4
The double-bed room with own bathroom that we booked last minute before our visit to London at the London marathon, turned out to be a very positive surprise for the money we paid. Despite the very bored and unfriendly lady at the reception everything was perfect. The location is safe and close to the underground and bus stations. (victoria station is just 15-20 minutes with the tube) The room was clean and recently renovated and furnished with IKEA furnitures and accessories. The room was really nice. The walls are like paper, you can hear everything that goes on in the corridors...especially when they are cleaning the room next to you...but really it is not the most important thing that you look for when you go with a cheap good location hostel. It was worth the money. Even;4
We very much liked how central the location of the hotel was, excellent for exploring the city. Very close to Penn station which was handy for us coming from Niagara and the subway was very close, ideal for getting to JFK Airport. The room was compact but very comfortable, we did have an issue with the room safe not working, we reported this and it was looked at but not fixed.  The tick tick diner adjoining the hotel was lovely and handy.  The staff were very helpful especially giving advice re subway directions. We were a bit disappointed at having to pay to leave luggage. We have travelled quite a bit and itâs the first time we have had to pay. I know itâs not vastly expensive but Iâd rather have not paid $20.;4
This is my second time staying at The Ameritania and I would stay again. Perfect location.  Friendly staff.  Nice rooms.  Just make sure you get a laundry bag and price list up front if you need it. (There were none in my room and I asked twice and did not receive after several attempts.);4
Perfectly located for transport links and exploring the city.  The hotel itself is full of old style charm, one can just imagine how it would have been in old times not to mention the celebrities who  used to frequent.  Past the foyer and the banks of wonderful old elevators it is however not so grand. The vestibules are stale like an old theatre. The rooms are tiny as most other NYC hotels. However they have tried to make them comfortable. Bed was sized to fit the small room but linens were fresh/clean. Bathroom, old but functional.  In summary, lovely old building with history, great location which compensate for small rooms but then who spends time in their room when in this city!?;4
we stayed for a wk end. very clean. rooms were small but what we expected.  our room had coffee maker. within walking distance to time square.  close to Penn Station and subway. New Yorkers very helpful in giving directions on subway.  we were told on check in extra fee would be waved since we are Wyndham vacation owners. It was not. extra $90.00 was charged:( I have recommended and would stay there again.;4
Hotel is comfortable and conveniently located near the finish area of the NYC marathon.  Also located across the street from subway to ferry terminal and start of marathon.  Many great restaurants in the immediate area - we will stay here again when running in the marathon next year!;4
However, parking was pricey. Otherwise, great stay! Take advantage of the complimentary breakfast - itâs worth it. Carry some cash to tip the guy at the omelet station as he is polite, fast, and efficiently makes multiple omelets and waffles at a time.  Room was clean & comfortable and while we transitioned to our new home, they allowed pets.;4
So the hotel is a 5 minutes walk from the Universal Studios entrance, which is great, and you also have a shuttle bus that will take you from the hotel to the Universal City Walk, which leaves every 15 minutes all-day.  The room was spacious and confortable, although I had a little problem with the smell (it smells like old-stuff,becouse you can't open any windows at all, and you are stuck with the air-conditioning system, which is pretty loud, but you can't shut it off during the night, becouse you'll wake up all sweaty). The bathroom is big, but it wasn't perfectly cleaned before our arrival - the sink etc were clean but I found several dark hairs on the floor at a closer look (I'm blonde so they were definitely not mine). The breakfast is great, wether you choose the;4
This hotel was great. It is located so close to everything. We had a great room on the 10th floor and although the room does not offer complimentary wifi, the room is just great: so comfy beds. And as this was a planned city trip, you were to exhausted in the evening to even think about free wifi. There is free wifi in the lobby. The staff was really nice and helpful. We will definitely come back to NYC and this will be the hotel we would book again, definitely. Thanks for having us:);4
I recently stayed at the Empire Hotel. I have staying here for years when I need a place to crash in New York. It's location is ideal with subways, restaurants, Central Park, and Lincoln Center only steps away. The staff is very helpful and pleasant. The rooms are nicely decorated. While not cheap, it is well worth the price.;4
Beautiful room on 20th floor with breathtaking view, and clean, continental breakfast included. Right across street from Universal Studios & City Walk. Centrally located for all Los Angeles touring & beaches. Staff was excellent!;4
We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights hotel is nice and like a tower its 0.4 miles away from universal studios and also very near from famous hollywood walk of fame. The furniture is a little bit old fashioned style the rooms have fridge included staff cleaned the room everyday. Staff is really friendly and helpful. They have wide variety of food but its a little expensive. Parking charges are $27/night. If you need water you have to pay atlest $3.99 for a small size water bottel so it is advisable to buy your own stock of water bottles with you. View was nice from my 7th floor.;4
My favorite thing about this place was the maid staff. Usually maid staff in any hotel is just sort of there and not really interested in helping. But this place has an attentive maid staff that always tries to help. They might not speak English very well but they know whats up and are very willing to lend their assistance.   Also the doormen are at the door quite often to help you in. For such a cheap hotel to have a doorman there was really cool and felt like a bonus. It adds a sense of security too which is nice to have.   The location was good. Definitely worth the price. About to blocks away there is a subway stairwell you can enter to get down to Times Square or Grand Central or too see the empire state building. You can even stay on a bit longer to head towards Little;4
Very new, clean, and sleep-friendly. Great dining area and the food there is delicious and you can come down eat it until late night. The Starline stop is in front of the hotel  The staff is really friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good and worth $29  If you find a hotel near LAX, this is it;4
Nice hotel, old like the most hotels in New York.Situated in very convenient location, midtown Manhattan.Just opposite Madison square, subway in front, Times square 10 minutes on foot, Macys 5 minutes on foot, Hop on hop off buses stops all around. Has to be noticed that rooms are very small;4
Old furniture and comodities but clean. Good room service. Staff polite and helpful. Air conditionning set almost everyday to 60 F (16ÂºC) by room service, but easily adjustable to a warmer temperature. Located close to central park in a nice area with nice restaurants for breakfasts and dinner. Subway (trains 1, 2, 3 direct to south Manhattan) station at the corner of the street, very close to the hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor and wifi worked perfectly.;4
On the Hilton 800 number, we reserved a package with 2 Universal studios tickets and breakfast tickets.  We were told the first nite would be at the higher rate, the 2nd at a AAA rate.  At check-in the front desk said our rate was the higher rate for both nites.  It was fixed after I questioned it.  We requested extra pillows and towels ahead of time on the Hilton Honors site.  We had to call housekeeping to get these.  They said that they were full and could only bring 2 pillows. The room only had 3 bath towels, we had to request extra each day also.  Our reservation was for 4 people.  The room was clean and looked like the hotel web site pictures.  The carpet was very worn and spotty.  It did feel clean though.  The TV was small and older.  The double beds were comfortable,;4
I stayed here for a single night with my girlfriend while we were in NYC for a night. This hotel was perfect for us, we are both in our early/mid 20's. The room is small, so if space is what you're looking for this is not the place. But the bathroom was great and clean, an awesome shower that was big with good shower head. Nice, comfortable king size bed and good tv. We didn't spend much time in the room, just pretty much to change once mid day and to sleep. But it was affordable and perfect for us for a quick stay in Manhattan.;4
I only stayed in the hotel for one night and didn't dine here.  I know NYC hotel rooms are usually tiny and far pricier than you could imagine.  I live within driving distance of NYC and chose to stay in this hotel so that I wouldn't have to drive home or Uber.  With that said, I was still shocked to find out that parking my car for one night with the hotel's valet would set me back $75!  Had I known, I would've just parked my car in a nearby parking garage.  Best Parking App (on my iPhone) has always hooked me up with really cheap parking.  This is what I get for choosing convenience over price.  Ouch.  After checking in, my friends and I immediately headed up to the rooftop bar/pool area.  That was perfect.  We were able to nab a table, take in the fantastic surrounding NYC;4
Lovely hotel with a huge family room. The location was perfect for our visit to Universal and we really enjoyed our stay.we had great views over the billed and city with a beautiful sunset.  Our only disappointment was that we're traveling with friends and our rooms were not close together, this would have made our stay much easier;4
"It was our first time to Universal Studios and we didn't really had any plans in staying, but this hotel was a great last minute choice. I agreed with some reviewers; local area and beds are not the best. We got to the hotel at 11 pm and driving that late was a bit scary, but come on who are we kidding it's LA. The bed were really hard, but it was mentioned on the room description online. Price and accommodations were very reasonable. Our room was really big, clean, and nicely decorated. We did notice that they are in middle of remodeling the front desk, but it not bad where it feels overwhelm. Breakfast was the best. Fanny and her team were awesome and really friendly. We loved the fresh eggs and fruit. The omelet man as how we named him, was really great and fast.";4
Just back from staying here for two nights for our visit to Universal Studios and LA.  Hotel is perfect for Universal studios. A few minutes walk to Universal entrance. We also used the courtesy transport (we found walking quicker than waiting)  My kids enjoyed the pool at the hotel also. Hotel was clean and well presented. Staff very welcoming and friendly.  Our only downside to our visit was the Frisky people in the next room. Please Hilton can you tighten your wooden headboards!!!! Not the best to get woken up to two nights in a row when you have kids!!;4
from the basement to the penthouse - every room is nice, clean, modern and well maintained.  the basement has what they call terraces.  patios to you and I.  also very private for the entertainment industry guests.  the high floors offer panorama's or views of the movie studio.  check in is easy and painless.  the bar is exquisite and for the smokers you can duck out a side door for a smoke.;4
The location was very good, staff was very, very great to all the family.   The hotels' rate was a little high.   A problem with meeting (convention) noise.   Very nice large pool with cabana's and hot tub.  A poolside bar was nice to have by both seating and the cabanas.l.;4
Close to several train lines, around the corner from a TKTS same-day performance tickets, with a nice variety of retail and restaurants. The Empire is ideally situated. The toiletries are plentiful. If you don't want to pay for Keurig coffee, there's a Starbucks downstairs around the corner. I'd certainly stay here again. Didn't try breakfast, as I preferred the options in the neighborhood. Only downside: hot water suppy seemed limited one of the 3 mornings. Otherwise, everything functioned well.;4
My family really enjoyed the stay in the Empire Hotel. The location was excellent, close to central park, Tkts office, musumes  etc and hotel staff were very helpful and friendly.I would highly recommend it as a place to stay.;4
The hotel represents a good value -- less than $150/night in a town where paying less than $200/night seems hard to do. The room was on the small side, but clean. The bed was comfortable. And the breakfast included was good with waffles and omelets made to order. However, my room was directly and it was LOUD outside. There are several hospitals nearby and sirens were common. There are some good places to eat within walking distance and an LA rail station is very close.;4
I know this hotel receives some negative reviews but I've stayed here about four times in the last 18 months and obviously, I think it's worth coming back to. It's centrally located....across from Lincoln Center, 1 block from Central Park, and walking distance to the theater district (if necessary).  The rooms are smallish, If there are only two of us, I book the double-double but when there are three, I book the Jr. Suite which is much roomier with a pull-out sofa bed and a larger bathroom.  I can't recommend the restaurant in the hotel, the Chowder House but the place next door, PJ CLarke's is surprisingly good for drinks, burgers, desserts, and having a Starbucks just a few steps out the hotel door is fantastic!  The concierge service is very helpful and the front desk staff,;4
My friend and I stayed at the Astor on the Park in November 2014. We got in at 5pm and there were no issues checking in. The consierge was kind enough to show us how to use the shower (seems as thought some people didn't know how).   The elevator is a little small and would probably fit 2 people plus 2 pieces of luggage max.  The room was simple, 2 double beds. Small window facing a wall - which didn't matter to us.  Water pressure was great, hot water in abundance and the room was clean.  The only thing that was a little annoying was that the alarm clock was plugged into the wall - which was linked to the main lightswitch. So when we turned off the light, the alarm would shut off. Making it difficult to set the alarm. However we had our phones which was good enough.  Overall I;4
All in all, this is a very good hotel. Probably one of the best in its kind. It has great value for money, is full of charm, and has a great, polite, smiling staff. We stayed in a captain's cabin which was large well enough (situated on the corner), but unfortunately, we had a lot of noise from the outside traffic.;4
awesome location. within walking distance to universal. really enjoyed that. rooms where nice but a little on the pricey side.;4
I spent Saturday and Sunday night here. Room was very small but clean and nice. Bathroom was shared but still kept really clean. The place is a bit of a party hotel, but amazingly if you aren't in the bar you can't hear it. I did enjoy my stay. And would definitely stay there again if I went to New York again, but just try and get a bigger room.;4
Recommended for the terrific location.  This hotel does have small rooms, older small elevators and no business center, but it does have friendly and competent staff, it's clean and best of all, it's less than a block from a 1-2-3 subway station. Since there was no business center, I was able to get my boarding passes printed at the front desk by emailing a PDF to the hotel. We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at the Manhattan Cafe around the corner on Broadway.  The subway station goes direct to Times Square and is 1 subway transfer from Yankee's Stadium.  The 1 Train also takes you to the West 116th Street Station (Columbia University) to catch the M60 SBS bus to LaGuardia. We each got a 7-day subway pass and were able to use it to print a transfer for the M60.;4
We picked the new Hyatt LAX as we needed a place convenient to LAX  on a recent trip to see the US Women's National Soccer team at the Rose Bowl. The hotel is new and the closest to LAX Terminal 1 - 5-10 min walkable but also has frequent shuttles which could actually take longer depending on traffic in LAX and around Century boulevard. As a Hyatt Passport member, I found a good rate online. I  checked in online so check in was fast and efficient. We were given a room on the top floor 12 - very clean, sound proof windows and comfortable beds. Bathroom was also clean, with shower only and hairdryer provided. There were USB chargers and a modern flat screen TV .There is a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee too. We had a good night sleep the first night without any air or road;4
The hotel was a 5 min walk to the Universal Studios front gate, also a short Lyft/Uber ride to the Hollywood Bowl, Warner Brothers' Studios, Griffith Park/Observatory and the Hollywood comedy clubs.  We had a very quiet stay on one of the upper floors - great sound insulation.  The breakfast included with the Executive floor was excellent - good variety of fruit, muffins, pastries, cereals, yogurt, cold cuts, lox mini bagels or toast, juice and coffee.  For $10 more you can upgrade to a full hot breakfast, or get a $20 credit to order off of the menu.  Waitstaff was very helpful.;4
This is very much a budget hotel, so it is not luxurious in any way. However, the location is fantastic. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The wifi worked reliably even though the front desk person warned us that it probably wouldn't. Some little amenities, such as an in-room safe, a magnifying mirror in the bathroom, and a comfortable bed, made this more pleasant than I expected. We needed assistance twice (safe and a slow toilet) and each request received a quick, effective response. The only real drawback was that only two elevators were working and they were slow. It isn't the Ritz - but it's a good value for the money if you want to stay in this part of Manhattan, which has few hotels.;4
We would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend. It is relatively affordable (by New York standards at least), has excellent subway access, and staff was very friendly.   Somehow our bed had 2 box springs instead of a boxspring and mattress. Staff were apologetic and gave us a new (better) room right away. The new mattress was very firm, but we prefer that... pillow top fans need not apply.   The windows in the room open, and the air conditioner worked great. The room was very quiet at night.   LCD tvs in the rooms and free WIFI.   We will stay here again on our next trip.;4
clean, smart, pretty good restaurant. we always lay over a night on our way from asia to the US and this is our go-to. last time, we saw it had been renovated - now even better. The only downside was the super slow desk and bellboy service upon arrival. We always come in after 8pm and it is always the same - short staff.;4
It's long but i hope it helps!  We stayed in this hotel in early 2008 for one week. We booked 2 twin rooms for our party of four (middle aged). And we could well afford this @ only â¬60 per room per night. We got this unbelievable deal @  www.hotelrooms365.com, simply use your credit card to book and with the dollar exchange rate right now you will get a simply unbelievable deal! There were lots of Irish and English at this hotel (aswell as Americans) from families to elderly couples!  I had researched this hotel on tripadvisor before we went and must say that the reviews are mostly accurate. As long as one is not going with hugh expectations then they will be very very happy with this hotel. (no bar/restaurant - not that you would be eating in your hotel in NYC anyway!!)  On;4
Rooms are large and very comfortable.   The location is ideal for visiting Universal studios.   Free shuttle available to Universal Studio and Hollywood walk.  Further in distance from main Hollywood strip - will need Cab or Uber is planning to be a around Hollywood strip but perfect if visting Univeral studios;4
Conveniently located, nicely remodeled, 24 hour shuttle, 24 food! Everything you need in perfect location.  We will definitely stay here again if we need to catch an early morning flight or we arrive at 2AM like we did this past trip.;4
10 days spent in New York using this hotel as a base... We had a family room which was great and very comfortable. The hotel was in a perfect spot, central for all our excursions in this fabulous city and the staff could not have been more helpful... The roof terrace added to the great views of the city too... A place to recommend!;4
Nothing blew me away but nothing disappointed either.  The room we had was smaller than expected for a standard but it was sufficient for our purposes We never made it to the rooftop but the lobby bar & lounge area was a cool place to grab a drink before heading out. The location is great for that area of the city. It was a good experience overall but I probably wouldn't have paid the money to stay here without the deal we had through a friend.;4
We stayed here for 8 days and it was very expensive. The room was so small there was hardly any room to walk around the bed to get to the bathroom. No tea or coffee facility to make a nice hot drink. Was so annoying having to go from the 42nd floor I believe we was on to go down and out to get a coffee. Security was really good. There was a very hot guy on reception and I kept flirting with him and he flirted back. Nice hotel, just not worth the money they ask for. Oh yeah, hard to receive a WiFi signal so high up too.;4
After reading reviews on this hotel i was a bit uneasy as I'd already booked it.but rooms were cleaned daily even on xmas day.they were basic but we only slept and showered and was out all day.we had no problems at all,yes lift was a bit slow at times but not a massive problem.you pay for what you get,and we got this at a really good price so no need for all the bad reviews.would stay here again.;4
I like the Hilton Hotels. This one is very nice. My wife won a trip to LA to visit WB Studios and see a taping of Big Bang Theory. This hotel is in a great location for access to these events (and was paid for as part of her prize package). We stayed in room 1657, a one king bedroom on the 16th floor. Because I am a Hilton Honors Gold Member, they gave us free executive (continental) breakfast for the two days we stayed, Oct 8 & 9. Surprisingly, the fact that we were paid guests at the hotel AND an HH Gold Member, they still would not give me free parking. I felt this was a bit of a slap in the face... I mean seriously, you pay for a room and you have to pay again to park your car? The room was very nice, huge with a huge bathroom, clean, and very comfortable bed. Refrigerator,;4
This was our third visit to the New Yorker over the years and while the public areas used to look a little shabby the art deco interior has now been restored to a high standard.  The standard rooms are pretty small but adequate.  The novelty in our bathroom was that the hot water was scalding and the cold water was pretty warm, so that flushing the toilet had the side effect of warming the seat.  Handy in January.  I had one big surprise when I checked out and I want to make sure others are aware of it - When you (or your travel agent) make a booking, make absolutely double sure that you are quoted a total and inclusive price.  If not, you will be hit by a 'facility fee' of $30 per day plus tax at checkout.  When I could speak, I asked what this charge was for and was told 'it;4
If you want a cuppa tea/coffee anytime take your own travel kettle and buy your own teabags or coffee in a supermarket because you will only get them free between 6.30am and 10.30am other than that the hotel was fab  especially Jeff the concierge;4
Amazing place, good atmosphere, great staff and best position near by Central Park and very close to Lincoln Center. Room clean ðð» Suggestion:  - having âaperitivoâ in the pool deck - going to the gym  - spending relax time in the hall with its charming design;4
Loved the roomy deluxe double. Clean and bright bathroom. Endless hot water. Comfy bedding. Plenty of outlets for chargers. Super welcoming front-desk clerks. Friendly doorman to greet you upon every departure/arrival. Elevators worked efficiently. Wonderful location around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theater (Stephen Colbert show) and so many terrific restaurants--both casual and a bit swankier. A few blocks to a lovely entrance to Central Park. Easy access to subway as well. No coffeemaker in room, but very reasonable to get coffee via room service, or one can visit  the Starbucks nearly across the street. We would gladly stay at this hotel again.;4
The hotel looks a little out of date, but rooms are comfortable, staff is friendly and location is fine. Very near to the LA Metro, so if you want to avoid traffic.... Breakfast is for American standards ample: one can see this hotel caters for Europeans as well.;4
We had lovely view of Lincoln plaza and the room was very spacious compared to other rooms we have stayed in NYC. Shower had wonderful water pressure! Really great experience overall and we are already planning our next stay.;4
the room we had was really good,we must have been lucky lol  the shower in our room was very very powerful :)  if you arrive to early to check in they will put your lugguage in a secured storage  we would stay there again   WE GIVE THE HOTEL A B+;4
best value for the location in NY. big room fantastic view of the park from the balcony. nice deli on the corner serving Turkish food. go to cafÃ©amrita on 110th street for the best blueberry pancakes we've ever had.  its a basic hotel but nice beds and bathroom great nights sleep and lovely staff.;4
lovely room clean spacious , nice breakfast , pool area nice but beware of mosquitos around the pool.location is good for all amenties like the metro only across the road and also good bus links. Takes about one hour to get to Santa Monica on the bus.;4
What a superb hotel.The hotel seems to go on forever as it is quite large and very soread-out.The food was excellent and presented with many different varieties.Staff  was ever so helpful.It was an amaizing.Rooms are well kept and very clean.mManagement and all the staff very friendly and always with us and ask what we need and what we want.I'm very thankful for everyone...we will hope to see you again..;4
Stayed here with my family over the Christmas period including Christmas day boxing day.Good hotel with everything you need, ten minute walk from time square and central Park,plenty of places to eat across Road and next to hotel.Starbucks coffee shop also next to hotel.Would stay here again;4
Luxury abounds as you enter The New Yorker Hotel By Wyndham, and you're taken back to a time when glitz and glamour were high class, and you can see from the marble floors, deep mahogany wood, and brass trim, that at one time, The New Yorker was on par with some of the swankiest hotels in all the world. A real architectural masterpiece! These days, the hotel lobby is still beautiful. They have it tastefully decorated with modern seating, albeit too few seats to accommodate the many guests that find themselves stuck there on the floor waiting on there rooms to become ready, or a car to pick them up. They do have several areas to plug in to power your phone or iPad. They have an area to leave your luggage if your room isn't ready, and that's helpful. So don't think you have to;4
Ok so if you like history, the New Yorker is for you. It's cool, old New York style. The rooms remain in that old style and while you can definitely see the wear and tear on the hotel, it was still charming and clean. The rooms are small, but that's New York. I really enjoyed the Tick Tock next store along with the other restaurant attached too. We got an amazing rate here so for what we paid and the experience we got, I enjoyed it. I will say if you're looking for a more modern, try another Wyndham property just a few minutes away called Tryp which has much bigger rooms designed for groups and families. Stayed there before and that property was great too!;4
The staff is friendly and responded quickly to requests like when a loud party was going on down the hall or when there was a dripping faucet.  The management needs to spend more time fixing the details like broken light fixtures, dings in the walls, stained carpets, and worn stairs.  The elevators that were working should be in an elevator museum, we often had to take the stairs after waiting a long time without an elevator showing up.  The breakfast buffet is extensive and is good for brunch.  The omelette chef went through the motions, but wasn't helpful or friendly.  This is southern California and they don't have avocados?  For two or more people, the best option to the Burbank airport is a taxi +/- $25 with tip.;4
The Empire is across the plaza from Lincoln Center and very, very convenient to the Upper West Side of Manhattan yet only 12 blocks from the theatre district. They were running a 40% discount sale when we booked and that made the expensive NYC hotel scene seem much more affordable. My wife, adult daughter and I stayed in a junior suite. The room was spacious. The closet space was limited and not well lit. The main bed was too firm for our tastes. For the sale price charged, the room was an excellent value for New York City.;4
A friend and I stayed here for 7 nights in a bunk bed cabin. The rooms are indeed tiny, but for me that was no problem. The hotel was simply a place to sleep and not to hang around. And they did make great use of the space. The communial bathrooms were always clean, but there could be a que in the morning for taking a shower. And the neighbourhood is great, lots of nice restaurants and a good neighbourhood to just wander around.;4
I really liked this hotel.  I stayed in a Captain's Cabin with a fabulous en-suite bathroom and thought it was quirky and comfy.  I was on the third floor so wasn't disturbed by noise from either the ballroom or rooftop bar. It's in a great location, 8 minutes from the Subway and only around the corner from the High Line and Whitney Museum of Modern Art.  Kava coffee shop is a minute away for a gorgeous cup of coffee which is a good thing as the hotel coffee shop only takes card, no cash. If you're looking to avoid Uptown prices and want somewhere unique then give The Jane a go.;4
Empire Hotel was located in a great spot. Close to many of the various sight seeing destinations in NYC. The only issue I had was that WiFi was not complimentary, nor the computers to print boarding passes. There was also a roach in the bathroom.;4
This hotel is basic, you get what you pay for, Stayed in this hotel for ten nights in a triple room, was small but comfortable, most of the time we didn't even stay in the room as we are in New York City!! When we first arrived, the room was clean and comfortable and was cleaned every day. The shared bathrooms also cleaned every day, depending on how many people in the hotel you could be waiting a long time for a shower however we overcome this by using showers on different floors. Also they could get quite messy during the day as lots of people were using them, but like i said before, we used bathrooms on different floors which weren't so unclean. Also, struggled to get hot water in one of the bathrooms, but as it was so hot when we were there, a cold shower was welcome! We;4
Nice Hotel, great location, well appointed/furnished, typical NYC-sized rooms. Exceptional customer service, Empire Staff willing to go above and beyond.  Great job Nick at registration & Jose/Simon for setting up reservation!;4
Great location and good standard of accommodation. Rooms cozy but it is NYC. Payable wifi I think is poor by today's expected standards. Enjoyable stay though and friendly attentive staff. Great location for the areas of the city I needed access to. Would recommend and will be staying again very soon.;4
As I mentioned on the previous page the only issue I have to mention is the overwhelming humidity in bathrooms! True there is a confined but there is no ventilation whatsoever! There is no shower door and the floor gets wet. No ceiling fans anywhere to help with the steam and humidity. The cloths on hangers get dumped. Sad to mention these issues when the rest of the service was excellent!;4
Me and my husband stayed at this hotel in late September this year to get married at the hotel, and found it to be alot better than most of the reviews on here. First of all, the location was not as bad as i had expected, the subway was only 3 blocks away and it took you into the city or if you wanted to explore nearly all the way to the bottom of manhatten. We found this mode of transport to be very cheap and quick. The hotel rooms are smallish, but there is room to move around and we found the bathroom quite a decent size and very clean. There is only one elevator but this did not seem to be an issue when we stayed, a couple of times we were waiting for it when it turned up with staff and all the cleaning products in. But they always moved all of their things out and let us;4
I normally don't write reviews for hotels, but I needed to make sure Dan Burke at the front desk gets recognized for his excellent service. Dan at the front desk was very helpful throghout my stay. He helped me with the issues I had in the room and solved them with a professional matter. It's people like this you meet places that make you want to come back. Thank you Dan Burke! What a hillarious guy!!;4
The hotel is in a great location being just a few minutes walk from Central Park and Columbus Circus. The room we had was a corner room and therefore very large compared to European hotel rooms.  We were here for 5 days over the Christmas period, but I can't say the hotel felt particularly Christmassy.   The lobby and reception area have been used for filming a tv programme ( Gossip Girl I think??) and as a consequence bus loads of tourists often come in a big group to take photos. That didn't bother us too much, but I can see how it could become annoying.  As discussed by previous reviewers having to pay for wifi nowadays its a bit of a cheek. The lobby is also where most guests attempt to log onto the wifi for free so it is quite often difficult to find a seat - and the wifi;4
A lovely, good quality hotel near Broadway and Central Park. Exceptional service from all staff. Really enjoyed relaxing in the bar area with cocktails. Traffic noise throughout the night was an issue and we were disappointed to miss out on the rooftop bar experience as it had problems with its computer system and could take cash only.;4
The location of this hotel near Times Square and the Theatre District was perfect.  The staff was friendly and helpful right from the start of our visit.  Jeff, one of the doormen went out of his way to help us with directions and arranged for a ride to the airport at the end of our visit, that was cheaper than Uber.  The only issue that we had with the hotel was their bathrooms.  Our bathroom had a toilet that was installed too close to the sink, to be able to use it comfortably.  Their bathroom off of the lobby needs some work as well.  The sink in the bathroom was slanted on the sides, which makes sitting anything on it almost impossible.  The bathroom issues can be overlooked because of their staff and the location.  They do need to fix their exterior entrance lights, as;4
A bit dated but excellent for the price Had a room with a great view of Empire State Building   This hotel is ideal as close to shops madison square gardens across the road. Close to time square. Value for money;4
Great location to go to Lincoln Center or for some great restaurants across the street or Columbus Circle.  Nice staff.  The bed was rock hard.  The rooms are small.  Same with the bathrooms.  The shower has a missing glass door so water covers the floor when you shower.  Reservations through a Promo sites get you a dark interior room.;4
Checking in was very easy, even though we hit what I'm guessing is the rush hour for check ins we still didn't wait very long to check in - maybe 5 mins. Figuring out where the parking lot was was a little tricky, but I attribute that to being tired from the long drive. Room was very clean and bed extremely comfortable (Cal King). Our room had a hot tub in it, which was awesome after walking around all day - it's not deep though so can only really be in it a foot or so. House keeping did a very fast job off the room, went out to grab breakfast and came back to room done - couldn't have been more than 2 hours. I'd stay again and recommend for people like us - younger crowd looking to stay at a reasonably priced hotel with amenities and very nice setting, and the breakfast is;4
Spent a night at the hotel to get an early flight from LAX. Really great service with every single person we met, especially Abel at breakfast. We had dinner at the 24hrs market- ate like if I was at a fancy restaurant yet there were plenty of light options too. Decor was awesome.. really chic. Shuttle service was fast and effective. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the shower had no water pressure, barely water came out and the room wasn't as clean as it could have been. But other than that- perfect option!!!;4
The hotel was ideally located and the room was in fair condition, we were there during the major dog show in NTC so a novel experience with pets everywhere, having said that it did nothing to detract from our stay.;4
I appreciated that Mackenzie at the front desk went above and beyond to make my birthday special by providing us with some special perks. The room was nice and clean. The rooftop pool area is nice and has a good view, but the pool was small and there weren't many lounge chairs surrounding the pool itself. The food at the rooftop bar was good, but I would emphasize that they serve snacks more than meals (the lobster tacos, for example, are four mini tacos). Overall, I enjoyed my visit.;4
Stayed four nights and would definitely return when next in NYC. Staff were friendly and helpful, including a courtesy call to our room to see if we were satisfied with it after check-in. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. Although it was a busy weekend and the hotel's bars popular, we were not disturbed. Ask for a front room with views of the Lincoln Centre. This was an ideal city base from which to explore: close to Central Park, shops,etc and subway.;4
We stayed at the Hilton for our trip to Universal. It's ideally located so we could pop back and forth to Universal with our 2-day pass. The lobby is striking and has a great atmosphere. We had a corner room, which was spacious and had a great view of the hills. The staff were also very helpful and nice. The only minor downside was the buffet meal we opted for looked more appetizing than it actually was (there's an array of seafood), as many of the dishes didn't live up to the price. We were also charged for service when we were only bought a couple of drinks (being a buffet, we had to help ourselves to our own food). However, this is a great hotel if you plan on visiting Universal Studios.;4
Great service and clean. Easy walk to City Walk. Pool is great and staff very nice. Elevators are slooooooow and give you great line waiting practice for Universal Studios. Concierge was very helpful.;4
"Best deal in town; if you can deal with the tiny room. Staff was very friendly and courteous. Rooms were nicely appointed with the barest of necessities. Room was extremely small with very little room to move around. A person 6 feet tall or more may find this space and bed to be unacceptable. Be prepared to improvise. On premise restaurant and disco. You might not want a room near the discotheque on weekends. Shared bath options. Excellent location in west village with convenient taxi service.  Can't beat the price. I would definitely stay again.";4
We stayed for one night at the hotel, the public area at reception is very nice, our room was nice, the bathroom clean but dated, what surprised us was the size of the room, it was not large but bigger than we expected for a city centre hotel, We ate in the restaurant linked to the hotel at night and in the diner also linked to the hotel in the morning. Both meals were very nice, we thought they were a little pricey but realised later on our trip that the prices were lower than other like places in New York. The staff were friendly and the location pretty good. The public corridor on the floor we stayed was in need of a refresh but all in all it is a pretty decent hotel.;4
We stayed here for our first visit to New York last year.  The accommodation is basic enough but the room and bathroom were very clean and there was a daily cleaning service.  It is situated a little too far out of the city centre - we found we wasted a lot of our trip getting subways into the city.  However, for what we paid for it - during high season - we couldn't fault it.  The staff were friendly and very helpful, giving directions, etc.  And it is literally just across the road from Central Park!;4
This hotel is awesome, staff is very friendly, extremely nice and comfortable, can't beat the location for universal studios and citywalk, was also a great location for the concert we attended at dodger stadium, will stay here every chance we get when in Los Angeles;4
Another trip to New York, and this time we chose the Empire based on a recommendation and a reasonable rate.  The Empire is located in a pretty good spot, within walking distance of many shops, restaurants and entertainment places.  Being on Broadway and Columbus is great for navigation as a pedestrian, and getting a cab.    As a weekend getaway, we unfortunately couldn't spend very much time at the hotel and I can't comment on the nightclub.  Of course the rooms are tiny, as are any other Manhattan hotel rooms in our price range, but our room on the 5th floor overlooking Broadway had little street noise and we slept very well.  Others have mentioned the peculiarity of the shower without the door, and it did seem odd to us, but the ceiling shower was very nice and strong.  The;4
This hotel is very convenient but is showing its age. The lobbies and rooms are very worn at least on our level. The room was quite good with windows on two sides as it was s corner room. American hotels need to understand the benefits of providing a fridge and coffee making facilities in their rooms. It was convenient also having the 24/7 Tick Tock Cafe downstairs for meals at any time.;4
We stayed here for our first anniversary and requested a room high up with a view. We were on the 36th floor and the views were amazing! I would recommend this hotel if you're looking for something nearby and will be spending most of your time exploring like we did. The room is small but was cleaned every day and towels changed daily too! The staff are very friendly and are always happy to help. The area around the hotel isn't great but there is a lot of police presence around the busy areas so we didn't feel unsafe, just be careful as you would in any other major cities! The McDonalds across the road is a bit dodgy so avoid if you can. But the hotel is so close to the Subway and all the popular cafe's, bagel shops etc. It's close to Times Square which can get very busy! We got;4
I stayed in the New Yorker Hotel in a Queen suite on the 22nd floor with city views from the terrace.   Pros: - The suite with two connected rooms and two bathrooms gave my family enough space to spread out.  - Rooms were very clean and the bed/mattress was very comfortable and firm.  - Terrace was probably the single best feature of the room with breathtaking city views facing east.  - Historic Art Deco charm and variety of room types. - Location, location, location - close to Penn station, K town, Times Square, subway station on same block.  - Good security for hotel guests   Cons: - Front desk service felt a bit rough around the edges. They gave me a hard about holding my luggage until checkin. They finally relented, however why isnât this a standard service at a 3 star;4
I can recommend this place for people going to explore London, not for relax. The room was small, with single bed and bunk bed (for 3 people) but was clean. The house is located a long way from centre but it is not problem - London is very well-communicated. You can use metro to all moving to city centre - what is more in this way you can save money, because Abercorn House is not expensive accomodation.  The only one minus are shared bathrooms and toilets - but we were aware of that.;4
We spent our honeymoon at Empire hotel.It is a beautiful hotel with everithing you can desire. The breakfast is very good and the pool is fantastic!!  Staff is very qualified, in particular Pasquale who gave us a great welcome at check in! Fabio and maria Rosaria;4
So this hotel has a charm to it that can be coined as very 80's. It almost felt as if I steeped back into Die Hard. Hence the title. Lobby is very 80's again (most of the hotel) with a large chandler in the middle. The rooms are clean and not too dated ALTHOUGH there is a phone in the bathroom. I was on the 23rd floor and the view was spectacular. The breakfast is great with a large spread varying from stir fry to waffles. The pool is decent but slightly small. The only negative is that the 101 is right below the pool (Hotel Is on a hill) so it is noisy. Some large shrubs maybe? Other than that its a good hotel. Best perk though has to be its convenience to Universal Studios.;4
I found the staff professional, helpful, and supportive of our needs. The room was comfortable and clean. My only complaint is the bathroom is made for tall individuals and I am just 5'2 and could not reach towel hangers.and the shower is difficult to configure. My only other suggestion is to streamline the printing boarding pass system.  Generally I have in other hotels gone out to the internet and printed easily.  At your hotel there was a block to Jet Blue Airline and the staff at the desk had to take their time to check me in.;4
Wi-fi is not included in the room price. The room was attractive but very small with no view.  The bathroom was super-tiny, which was fine for one person but would be impossible for two. The elevators are incredibly slow.;4
This hotel is excellently located for a visit to Univeral Studios as it is right next door. It also has Citywalk area there fo ra  variety of restaurants and free shuttle service which makes this U Studios experience v easy as we only had two nights in LA. Its location is also central enough to visit other sites in LA such as the Sidewalk of Stars (not sure what correct name is). The hotel rooms are surprisingly large and the elevated views is a nice extra. It has the excellent amenities of Hiltons with teh assoicated v attractive deals which come with being a Hilton member. Definately worth checking out if going to that part of LA.;4
Charging every time you get out of Park Garrage a charge of $22.00 is way over the limit. This disturbed our stay as we had to limit going in and out plus checkout early to avoid added Parking Fees. For Corporate usage I guess fine but for family visits this is not ideal;4
Location very convenient.  Love that I could check in early.  Rooms are a little dated but I was able to upgrade to a suite.  Not the suite I was promised (I requested and was promised a terrace - they even emailed me a picture) but I was happy with the room.;4
I came to town for New York Comic Con, and chose the New Yorker because it's a short walk from the Javits Center. It's also right across the street from MSG and there is access to just about any subway line you could need. The hotel has all the standard amenities, and as a bonus there's a Nikola Tesla exhibit in the basement. If you're diligent, you can also find the room where Tesla died, marked by a plaque. That was neat.  That said, I booked a suite for extra square footage and I'm glad I did because the room was positively tiny. There was barely enough room in the bathroom to get past the door that opened inward and then shut the door, as the door bumped up against the toilet. The sink barely had enough vanity space for toothpaste. The bedroom area of the suite had about one;4
Jessica was very helpful at reception, gave me some maps of the area with details of nearby restaurants and shops. We didn't have time to use the pool or sauna. The room was very comfy and quiet. Housekeeping staff very cheerful. I reported that our fridge was not working and it was fixed by the time we returned. I did not find the location scary. It was very close to the metro stations and bus routes. We bought a weekly pass and used it to go everywhere. Los Angeles is a lot bigger than I imagined . If you check on google maps it will tell you exactly which bus to take and what stop to get on and off at. There is a bus which goes right up to the Griffith Observatory from Vermont/Sunset just a few blocks up the hill from the hotel.;4
Everything was wonderful - price, location convenience, activity, a 24 hour diner just below.  My only complaint is the shower.  Not very much power and it would go from freezing cold to scalding hot in seconds without touching anything;4
Came to New York for my studies and had to get a hotel for a few days before my apartment was ready. The Park West was great and did not have to look elsewhere. The staff was accomodating and helpful. I had the pleasure of having Yaya and Miguel help me with my reservation and all went very smoothly. My room was very satisfying apart from the water that takes a little bit of time to heat up. Looking past that, this was a wonderful stay and I would recommend this hotel for people with a medium budget like students or young adults.;4
I really enjoy my stay in the Empire Hotel. I was there oct-nov for 7 days. Everything was perfect and information about everything about the hotel and services too. Maggie in the lobby was the best, really nice and helpful.;4
First thing that comes to mind when entering the hotel lobby is WOW. The view of universal studios from my room was awesome. The pool and jacuzzi area is breathtaking.  However, when it comes to service, there is quite a room for improvement. I will list down point wise 1) The shower was pouring only hot water or warm water. There was no cold water and I had a tough time with it.  2) After I came back home, I saw a charge of 9.21 USD extra as room service. On inquiry I found out that they have charged for 2 water bottles which I never consumed. It appears that there were supposed to be 3 bottles while there was just 1 when I checked in. It means they didn't check the room properly after the last guest checked. This is the least you can expect from a hotel.  3) Many of the lamps;4
I am staying in many hotels in NYC but this one was extra special from the service, to room size and the efforts everyone made to make you feel special. David who greeted me with a huge smile that took away all my tiredness (red-eye back to meetings including one no show) his Service (capital S) made me feel at home while I am away from home. The room size the large-sized shower made this stay one to remember.;4
I found this hotel clean and tidy, with housekeeping excellent. The complimentary breakfast was fantastic and the hotel staff were very accommodating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in LA;4
The location is great for Universal Studio with a fantastic view of Burbank. The hotel was clean, fresh and friendly. The staff was efficient and very helpful with all your needs. The Covid status did limit some things but overall wonderful experience.;4
I had a staycation with my boyfriend for his birthday. A mini getaway for his birthday. The hotel lobby was gorgeous and mesmerizing. The hotel room was beautiful but there are several painting jobs that needed to be redone, sink needs to be redone, and the shower needs to be fixed and needs a shower door or curtain. The one thing that made the hotel amazing besides the comfortable bed was the customer service! Since we were only staying there for less than a day, the receptionist was able to give us access to the internet for a little while without having to pay for the service. She also remembered me and my boyfriend, which made me feel welcome in the hotel. Gunita was an amazing receptionist and definitely deserves recognition for that! I will visit the hotel again, but I;4
"Stayed one night for a business conference.  It had been many years since I had stayed here and the rooms were appealingly updated.  Their location has always been a positive; across from Lincoln Center.  Clean room, nice bathroom. Larger room compared to most in NYC. Conference lunch was good but a bit odd; the only napkins were cocktail napkins.  They seemed not to be really set up for a conference. But the staff was very pleasant and the room was, again, very nice.   I should note that I didn't  care about views or free Wi-Fi, so I didn't request or pay for such.  Price was reasonable although it was a group rate.";4
All the staff there are very friendly and the bellman is great.   We had a room with its own bathroom so we didn't have to share facilities.   Was a nice room.  We were comfortable.  Good bed and pillows.   Nice bathroom.   Really nice old style interior.   Handy to metro stations (10 minute walk) and lots of local cafes and restaurants.   Free WIFI worked well.;4
A little gem in the funky meatpacking district.  Room was tiny (as advertised) but clean with fresh linen each day.  Service was excellent and staff were very helpful at all times.  Bathrooms were easily accessible and relatively clean.  It was however noisy - at night you could constantly hear doors opening and closing - I'd recommend ear plugs.  Great cafe and bar.  I'd definitely recommend it for the price and location if you are on a budget.;4
Very nice place to stay though not easy to find.  They need to pick you up at a specified pick up point or you'll get lost trying to find it. It takes a little over 15 minutes to walk to the Jemaa el Fna square (main attraction) .  I had my first Hammam ever there and it was really good.  Breakfast was good but I had better in Fes. I was given a local mobile phone in case I got lost but never needed to use it. My room was quite big (Rose) and confortable but the shower was not very good.;4
Our first hotel on our USA holiday. Arrived from our 15 hour flight from Aus. Check in was efficent and very welcoming, nice lady. Explained how the hotel worked and where everything was located. Free wifi being a HHonors member which is a free signup. Just do it before you book. Room was great, best beds and pillows of the entire trip. It felt like we slept on a cloud that first night, just what was required after next to no sleep on the plane flight.  Plenty of storage space for clothes nice bathroom area also. Nic view over Universal and CItywalk. Pool area was really nice, drink prices were on the high side though. Had the seafood buffet on one night, just ok, high price and not much that the 8yr old would eat.  Only negative has been mentioned by countless others and that;4
Hotel location is terrific for us. Walking distance to many of our favorite museums and theaters.  Great area for leisurely walking and shopping in the upper west side. Subway access makes all of the city very easy from this spot.  Our room was clean and comfortable. Nice bathroom but no tub.  Although our room was high up, we still had plenty of street noise so ear plugs are a must.  Small but adequate fitness room was a plus.;4
Heating/air conditioning was unsatisfactory.  Difficult to sleep because of the heat and necessary continual fan.   Breakfast was very good.  No need to go out to dinner because of the good quality of restaurant  Loved the location.;4
When I first found The Jane, I was suspicious. The price was extremely low for the great location and I wondered what the catch was. The only thing I could find was that the rooms were really small, but I only planned to stay one night by myself so I booked a room.  The most important part of staying here is knowing what you're getting into. Yes, the rooms are REALLY that small. Think cruise-ship room small. There is a bed on one side, a mirror opposite the bed, and a counter at the foot of the bed with a flat-screen TV and a window on the wall. There is also a very strong fan and a bottle of complimentary water. Be careful though--the water is free, but the fancy glass bottle is $30. The room keys control the electricity in the room by fitting into a slot by the door. It is;4
We booked 3 nights in this hotel through hostelworld.com but it seems thay never received our booking and were (of course) full when we arrived there on a Friday afternoon. The receptionist was very nice though and took time to find an alternative place for us for one night and booked us in with them for the other two nights.  The only place which still had rooms available was a tiny hole of a hostel in midtown Manhattan, which cost twice as much and was way worse then the Morningside Inn and that is why they gave us one free night with them AND a 1-night upgrade to their best room. When we returned to the Morningside Inn the next day, we appreciated it even more after the horrible, tiny, dark place in midtown where we spent the night before.  The inn is located in a lovely;4
Checking in was easy and quick. But while the room was tidy, there was a empty juice can in the bin, old make up and it was obvious the bath hasnât been used in awhile with dust and dirt round the edges. On the second night I discovered I was to be charged an administrative fee of Â£40 that I was unaware of, after insisting I didnât owe them this for two days they eventually removed it from my account. The other staff were polite and friendly. Biggest bug bearer was the lifts, once I had to wait 15 mins to get a lift, they were always full, no social distance!!! On my last day the lift stopped altogether and had to go down the stairs, I was on the 29th. Its ideally situated to most sights and the subway.;4
We stayed on the second level. Booked a double room, was pretty good for a hostel room, small bar fridge, wardrobe, cups, plates and cutlery. The bar fridge was great because we could actually buy milk and cold meats! Such a relief. The staff were also really helpful, the printer was out of order so they just printed stuff off for free. Also really close to the tube which is great. Towels are changed every two day, which is nice.  The cons. The kitchen doors on all levels have no dampener so they slam shut and echo through all the hallways! Which is a bit annoying when its 10pm, and you have to be up at 4:30am for a flight. The walls are also super thin. And you have to pay for WiFi, which is a bit of a bummer. The shower layout just plain sucks! There is no ledge or anything to;4
I had a flight that landed at 3:30 pm, a basketball game (Lakers vs Clippers, season opener) at 7:30 pm tip off, and a flight out at 5:15 am. I needed a hotel that was close to the airport so that I could change, grab a quick bite to eat, get to the game, get back and be able to get a few hours sleep. Hyatt Regency fit the bill to a T. The hotel shuttle picked me up at the airport. After about a 6 minute ride, I was at the hotel. The check in process was smooth and quick. I was able to get showered, go to the club lounge for some snacks and water, all in about an hour. I took a ride share service to and from the basketball game. I grabbed some snacks in the lobby (about 10 bucks for a Snickers, some mixed nuts, and some popcorn) and headed to my room. Watched a bit of TV and;4
Just got back from New York. This was our first visit to New York and stayed at the New Yorker. This hotel is in a brilliant location to get out and about from. I went with a friend and asked for twin room. We were given a massive room with two double beds and two bathrooms. The room is very dated, but was spotlessly clean. The beds were very comfortable and we were provided with thick soft white towels. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, which was slightly disappointing, but we did take our own travel kettle, which we used. They provide shampoo, conditioner and moisturiser, but no shower gel, which I found odd, as I would have preferred shower gel to moisturiser. John at hotel concierge was brilliant. He always had a smile and gave us directions and help;4
"Staff friendly and helpful. Check-in efficient and at rate booked (through Priceline). Lobby charming. Room very clean, with appointments expected: TV, coffee maker with ample coffee, cream, sugar. Bathroom newly renovated, attractive. Best features: cleanliness, bathroom, free high speed wi-fi, proximity to subway station. Station for 1,2,3,9 (leading down Broadway and through center of West Side, Midtown, and Lower Manhattan, is less than 100 meters from front door. There are 2 entrances to subway: one on 96th street north of hotel, but the 96th St station also has one on 94th street just a ""stone's throw"" from the hotel entrance. Flying out from LaGuardia? On Saturday morning, cab arrived within 5 minutes of staff's call; we were at airport in 20 minutes. Local market offers";4
We stayed here as flying back to the Uk after a 2 week holiday.   The hotel was lovely and the pool was a nice area as well. The hotel is very close to airport but nothing else. You can get to the mall on the bus at a near by bus station.  Staff on check in were so god damn rude, we arrived early as flight landed at 1.00 and check in wasnât til I think 4.00, spoken to like dirt because we arrived early.;4
"The inside of the hotel is very dim. It needs to be brighter so that the guests aren't afraid to walk down the halls alone. Breakfast is awesome but the chef automatically says ""om.e.let?"" (Omelette) regardless of you telling him 5x that you want scrambled eggs and he still makes you an omelette.... Other than that the breakfast is great with all of the options available. Location is awesome but the paying for parking was crazy to me. You could just park on the side street for free. Save 23$ a night. Room was very very nice with a balcony. I didn't like the fact that anyone on my floor could walk over to my balcony at anytime.... That wasn't cool but the other floors had private ones. The Russian girl at the desk gets an attitude sometimes and she claimed she couldn't do";4
The hotel is located near redline metrostation. We went to Universal Studios by metro and a free shuttle from metrostation. No parking fees, metro costed USD 1,50 per person per direction. Easy access to Hollywood Boulevard (Walk of Fame) . The hotel was clean, staff very friendly and everything was working fine. For those who suffer from noises not to be able to sleep not a good place because there were several hospitals in the neigbourhood and ambulances were loud.   We took a bus  to Santa Monica Pier Beach.;4
A very pleasant staying in New York, due to the excellent position of Ameritania, close to Central Park and all the main city attractions. Many thanks to the hotel guys Julian and Jalal, for their help and kindness.;4
Generally pleased with the stay. CONs: housecleaning didn't leave bathmat and washcloths one day. Internet should be included in the room price as well as the in-room coffee/tea. Staff was friendly and helpful.;4
Let me start by saying my stay at your hotel was very satisfying. The staff and front desk were extremely professional, helpful, efficient and had an overall pleasant demeanor. As I am sure you have heard the quality of the room left a lot to be desired to say the least. I just don't understand why you wouldn't make the minor improvements that would improve the quality rating immensely at a minimal financial investment. Items such as peeling wallpaper, chipping paint, and an outlet cover hanging off the wall shouldn't be allowed to represent which is otherwise a very nice hotel. Here's one for free - Why not put a simple cheap(in cost) plastic shower curtain to at least block some of the water from flooding the bathroom? Just a suggestion. Having said that I would love to stay;4
My boyfriend and I have stayed at the Empire on two separate occasions.  On both stays we have had good experiences.  The rooms are fairly small (what rooms aren't in NYC) but nicely decorated.  The bathroom is also very small and the open shower is a little incovenient.  On our second stay with Empire we got stuck in a bad room, but they were very accommodating and moved us to a higher and larger room overlooking Lincoln Center.  The rooftop bar is excellent and the lobby bar is great as well!  The location of the Empire can't be beat.  We will be back!;4
As already stated by other reviewers, this is a perfect place to stay if you aren't planning on spending a lot of time in your room. Having read other reviews I asked if we could have a room facing the park - they couldn't guarantee it (asked when we dropped the bags off and it was too early to check in) but when we returned, sure enough our room faced the park. Our windows didn't take full advantage of the view but it's great to know it's there and get a little peek. Plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance. Subway stations are very close. My 72-year-old Mum was with me and she got around just fine.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Our room rates were a lot pricier than the rates I've read about in other people's reviews. I'd love to know how to get;4
Great stay, hotel central and close for sight seeing. Upgraded to an executive room free of charge with all the extra you would expect from coffee machine to toiletries. Room made up and cleaned every day. Staff friendly and helpful.;4
Fantastic stay, lovely hotel, would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again. Roll on 2018 ð the next time we are planning to go. Staff were friendly and helpful. Hotel is in a great location, the perfect base to start your day. Rooms were clean and the beds were really comfortable.;4
Very convenient to Penn Station for trains. Nice hotel,however rooms are small and a few bathrooms could use updating. The tick toc was a good place to eat breakfast. If your looking for place to stay consider this hotel, staff are very pleasant.;4
This hotel was very reasonably priced and in a great location so we jumped on it. We stayed for two nights on their super soft beds. After the first night my wife wanted to change the room because the exterior of the window was dirty and Majid, at the front desk, worked very hard to make that happen. At first he didn't think he would be able to get us a different room because the hotel was full but he worked some magic and made it happen. That made my wife very happy which made my life wonderful again so thanks to Majid!!! Also a special shout out to Said, the doorman. When I misjudged the first step to the hotel and took a spill he was very quick to help me up and also was great with our bags. It's nice that you can leave bags after check out and they will be safe. Overall, a;4
Clean (the room and bathroom were cleaned every day. they gave us more towels than we needed and changed them every day), friendly staff, the room was just what you need (with a good but a bit noisy AC, and a TV with a good choice of channels), the bell captain/luggage service was perfect. nothing was decieving or annoying, except the fact that it has no restaurant. but the hotel is located in a area where u can find EVERYTHING (grocery shops, restaurants, coffee shops, pharmacy, dry cleaning service, etc etc). the location is good (u can find anything you need) but a bit far from downtown manhattan. i was positively surprised with this hotel.;4
"I spent 3 nights in the posh, boutique Empire Hotel with my friend last week.  The rooms are quite small for US standards, but we managed.  The bathroom is extremely small and the shower has a stationary glass that goes half way across, but nothing to keep the water from splashing out.  I didn't realize how wet the floor was.  There is a wall shelf, but no counter space at all.    It is across the street from the Lincoln Center, about 2 blocks away from Central Park, Starbucks next door....  My friend had a class all day, so I spent my day walking around the city.  It was a beautiful ""chamber of commerce"", not a cloud in the sky day!  I loved seeing the families in the parks with their children, the carriage rides thru the park, seeing the Rockefeller Christmas tree going up,";4
Ze and Nick (people that wil meet at check in) are the best !!!!!!!!!! Very helpfull indeed, nice, realy great !!!!!!  The hotel is in front of L. Center, a beautifull place to stay. Just two blocks from Central Park. The area is also well served by 4 lines of subway. You can go to any place in few minutes.;4
Being on Broadway you cant go wrong with where this hotel is located. Just a few short blocks and you will be in the centre of Times Square.  Modern hotel room with very trendy decoration. Shower was nice and big but a lack of places to put your things in the bathroom meant having to put the toilet seat down to use as a shelf when getting ready.  No free room wifi, however there is free wifi in the lobby.    Overall a very positive experience and would stay here again.;4
We stayed in this hotel June 2012 and it was of very high standard. The rooms were lovely and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Breakfast was delicious with 2 omelette makers to make whatever omelette you wanted. I found it great that you could also choose between egg whites or whole eggs. The gym was a little bit small but apart from this the hotel was great and we enjoyed our stay;4
After reading a few mixed reviews,we were a little apprehensive,but I must say we had a superb stay at the Empire ,rooms are nice and clean,ALL the staff are very good from front desk to rooftop to maids.The rooftop bar is Excellent and the staff and dj,s are very friendly and are up for a good time and fun.I would have no hesitation about staying at the Empire again next time we are in New York.Also within a few minutes walk are some superb bars and restaurants.;4
The Hyatt Regency LAX is my Go-To hotel for LAX stays the night before a flight. It's a great hotel, with clean and recently refurbished rooms, and it is walking distance to T1~3 & TB - but they also have an airport shuttle (if you have multiple bagsClub lounge is also nice for a quick-bite before heading over to the airport.;4
We stayed there for to spend the night after Universal Horror Nights.  Great location to stay at where we could just walk home.  The staff was good.  Check-in took a little longer time than I expected.    We stayed in a king bed on the executive floor.  The room was quite large. The complimentary multi-charger was an unexpected surprise.    Better than expected.  Would've like to have spent more time there.  $28 for parking was probably the only disgruntled part of the hotel.;4
I was pleasantly surprised.  I expected a motel-like property. However, it is a small full-service hotel.   It is a well kept, yet a little dated.  My check-in was positive.  I was greeted by the desk receptionist, Pil.  He was very positive and helpful.  What's more, he went out of his way to help me with a future stay.  I must spend three days in the area because my partner was having surgery in a hospital a few blocks down the street.  I asked if there was a  lower rate for such circumstances.  I had already booked on-line.  He spent some time on the computer and offered me a room at a very reasonable rate compared to my own booking.  It certainly relieved some of the anxiety I was already feeling because of the surgery in the next few weeks.  I appreciate going out of his;4
Stayed with friends for one night. The location is perfect for Lincoln center, shopping, great restaurants and drinks. The Lobby is well appointed. The Beds were comfortable. The Bathroom is a bit small and some painting touch ups required in the elevator. There is Not much closet space.   I would absolutely stay here again for a night or weekend trip with friends. Starbucks is also right next door for morning coffee.;4
"Stayed here last week for a Wedding in NYC. We arrived on Monday afternoon to the nice surprise that we had all been upgraded! Complimentary Wi-fi served us really well as we were constantly on Google looking where we were going the next day! The hotel is within walking distance of most places (but do take good comfortable shoes!) and also next to the Lincoln Centre Subway stop so everywhere is reachable! The rooms were a good size and nice and clean! All the staff were really friendly and there is a pharmacy just round the corner (good to avoid the $8 bottle of water in the mini bar!).  The rooms were quite warm so we slept with the window open most nights, but got very stuffy as soon as you put the hair dryer on...but this is New York; how much time do you spend in your room";4
I stayed at the New Yorker hotel for 3 weeks on business and I just want to say that Samira and Muhammad at the front desk were extremely polite and helpful in making my stay a comfortable one.   The hotel has a great iconic feel to it. The staff are friendly. The views are great. The neighbourhood is exciting without the touristy feel of Times Square.;4
Perfect location with the subway literally a 20second walk out the door the hotel has a old fashion marble reception area, previous reviews stated that the hotel rooms had dated old fashioned furniture, the only thing old fashioned though was the tv and you dont come to new york to watch tv or sit in the room all day using wifi no! you come shopping and sight seeing. The hotel in general was practically perfect apart from the fact that we were mistakenly overcharged which was resolved within 24hrs of the issue being raised.  So if your looking for a low price stay in new york with a perfect location then this is the place =);4
The New Yorker Wyndham Hotel is one of the older, but grand hotels, in New York. For what it lacks in elegance, it makes up for it in its art deco architecture. Since it is an older hotel, it needs a cosmetic face lift such as new carpets, paint and overall upkeep. I have no complaints about the staff since they were all courteous, professional and always helpful. My room was small with no view. The bathroom, likewise. No complaints there because I took the least expensive package when I booked my trip to New York. I wasn't expecting much and that's what I got. What I didn't expect was this hotel hosted quite a few luminaries of old and one of them was Muhammad Ali. There is a museum in the basement chronicling their visits. And it is free. But the wifi, fitness room and;4
If you are going to the ballet, opera or other event at Lincoln Center you could not do better than to stay at the Empire Hotel. It is right across the street and it means no traffic to get to the show. Cap it off by eating at Lincoln, the restaurant at Lincoln Center, before or after the show, and it will be a perfect, low hassle stay. A couple of things to be aware of: ask for a city view. Many rooms face the air shaft which is grim. Also, this is New York City so the rooms are tiny. They are comfortable but be prepared, they are small. The hotel offers great specials on line. Also, no coffee in the room which is a major bummer, but there is a Starbucks on the corner of the property in the opposite direction from Lincoln Center. Better than waiting for room service. The Lounge;4
We were given a spacious room, which is very unusual by NYC standards. So that was definitely a plus as well as its absolutely prime location. Times Square is a stone's throw away and the hotel is smack on broadway. The noise from the streets below could be heard despite closed windows but that seems to be the case whatever you are in New York.  The room itself was very tidy. The bathroom door didn't shut so we told the reception and they tended to the problem immediately and got it fixed.  The hotel had four elevators on each floor so you never had to wait long for a lift to turn up.  Our bags were brought to the room by a bellboy whether you wanted it or not.  All in all a comfortable stay and a hotel I can recommend if you're willing to pay a pretty penny for even the;4
An average Hilton hotel at a good price close to Universal Studios and City Walk. Not much to say, it doesn't have a lounge for Hilton Honors elite members, but they give you two coupons per day for continental breakfast. Doesn't really make up for the lack of a concierge lounge, but it's something. When they remember to do it, they put two tiny bottles of water in your room each day complimentary for elite members. The rooms and bathrooms are of a nice size and the bathrooms have marble. The elevators are being worked on now so it takes forever for one to show up to your floor, and if you are unlucky enough to be on a lower floor by the time it gets to around the 12th floor headed down it's already full and since it stops on every floor for those trying to get on it takes;4
On arrival first impressions of the hotel were excellent.  It was our 30th wedding anniversary and Jose at the front desk was extremely helpful and upgraded us to a room with a view of the Empire State Building.  The hotel could probably do with a little TLC as some areas do seem a little dated, including the room. This did not detract from our enjoyment and the hotel's central location does help to make up for its other deficiencies. All staff were extremely polite and helpful and unlike some other reviewers we were made aware at the outset of the additional charges (resort charges etc.). I would definitely stay here again if we were to return to New York.;4
Breakfast is fabulous.  Watch Hugo cheerfully juggle omelets, fried or scrambled eggs, and waffles with perfect timing, and everything is delicious.  Enjoyed the central courtyard and 2nd floor back porch.;4
The Jane has the feel of 19th Century NYC. The rooms are small, however, they have  many retro touches and the decor is very suggestive. If the intention was to create the mood, they are succesful. The decoration is inticing. In addition, the rooms are sound-proof. Even the temperature was perfect. I will return to The Jane for a short stay, it is worth it.;4
"This hotel was clean and tidy all be it a little basic. The position is fantastic; just on the edge of Central Park; close to the metro and we were even able to attend a free concert at the local cathedral around the corner put on by the New York Philharmonic orchestra. The staff were friendly and helpful.";4
After reading the reviews i will be honest i wasnt looking forward to this stay however, on check-in i was greeted by a friendly member of staff who explained how to get to my room etc. myself and my friend were situated on the 5th floor and while our room was on the small size it was clean, we didnt notice until quite late that the A/C wasnt working, we forgot to mention to reception the next morning however, when we returned we found it had been replaced and been switched on (which was a blessing) yes we had a shared bathroom and after other people have used it, it will be hard to keep clean but everyday we saw housekeeping around. on our last day the bathroom was closed which i assumed was for maintenance but we were told where other bathrooms were. overall if you are looking;4
The hotel is steeped in history and conveniently located:  in close proximity to the many of the main attractions that most first time visitors have on their bucket list.  For a simple meal, Tick Tock Diner is located in the hotel and is open 24 hours.  There is also an excellent Italian restaurant.   Our room was small, but clean.  Our bed was comfortable. The housekeeping staff, front desk, and all other staff members were very helpful.  To make the most of our last day in NYC, we checked out but had our bags stored at the hotel until we were done sightseeing.  The fee to store our bags was $2.00 per bag.;4
This Hilton was beautiful and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  The rooms were in great shape and very comfortable.  The hotel was in easily accessible proximity to numerous attractions and especially user-friendly for families.  Lots of choices for every price range and interest.  The pool was great and the daily barbecue was fun.  The hotel restaurant's food was tasty and attractively presented.  The bar and patio options were also very nice - a tad bit pricey but good.  Internet was free for HIlton Honors members.;4
The hotel itself is in great shape for itâs age. Nicole at the front counter was externally polite, friendly and beyond helpful.  The rooms are clean and functional, the cleaning staff do a great job. The complimentary breakfast is great fuel for your day ahead, again the staff are very friendly.  Very happy with our time spent here so far. KD;4
We have stayed at a different LAX hotel before on a layover. We ended up needing to take a cab and getting it reimbursed as the hotel included airport shuttle. I didn't want to deal with that. I wanted the most reliable shuttle service at the airport. It worked out for us. We got in really late. We hardly slept, but had to go somewhere and then out the door to pick up the shuttle. We jumped on a shuttle right away and it looked like there was another one right after it. Either we got really lucky, or the service was really good with back ups. I'm sure the hotel had nice amenities too, but we needed a bed and shuttle!!!;4
For a short stay in LA we chose this property. Staff were helpful and the room was good and clean. Breakfast was included and set us up for the day. The LA Metro is just a short walk which proved easy for a visit to the Science Centre.;4
Stayed one night for a connecting flight next day.  Excellent location, you could walk there from LAX. ( they do have 24hr shuttle)  Very clean, comfortable beds. Had room service (too tired to go to restaurant) fast and fresh. They do not have 24hr room service,  although we hit the bed for an early rise, so for us not an issue.  Could have better block out curtains.  Good sound reduction  would stay again.;4
Overall, the stay was wonderful.  We immediately got our room even arriving well before check in time.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They were willing to give us recommendations for food, shows, and other fun activities.  The room was clean but small.  It had all the amenities necessary but not really a view.  Overall, it also located in a wonderful spot right next to central park and just short of Time Square.  We had a wonderful time for a weekend getaway in New York.;4
I enjoyed my stay at The New Yorker. Very conveniently located near the train station and has subway access just outside. I also enjoyed looking through the mini museum they have on the basement level. There is a lot of rich history at this hotel and I hope they continue to preserve it in their renovations.  Yes, the rooms are small, but that is to be expected staying in the heart of NYC.  My room had a Keurig and a mini fridge.  I saw some reviews saying they didnât have that. The room was kind of perpetually damp. I think that has more to do with the weather while we staying. The paint around the bathroom windows was peeling due to the lack of ventilation in the bathroom. I suggest cracking the window open while bathing to help prevent this. (Yes, you can open the windows a;4
We spent 11 nights at New Yorker hotel. We lived in renovated room, in 31st floor. Room was clean, with very confortable mattress, with good AC, clean bathroom including new sink, WC and shower. Every day room was cleaned and towels was changed as often as we wanted. Room has all needed perks as coffee machine (got additional coffee tablets every day), safe, TV with more than needed channels, mini fridge, bathroom amenities as shampoo, shoer gel, conditioner, soap, hair dryer, bath robe.  Yes, the room was tiny, but we fit. :) as our goal was to spent time in New York City not in the hotel room it was more than enough. The location is perfect, basically everywhere can go by foot.  Sadly hotel do not have breakfast and not providing any discounts for guests for Tick Tock Diner;4
We had an amazing time in New York and the location of this hotel made the experience even better. We upgraded to a room with a view and it was worth the extra few dollars. New York is now my favorite city and i can wait to go back.;4
The location canât be beat, but not a good value. While smaller hotels offer all sorts of free amenities, this hotel will nickel-and-fine you for everything. Check-in early? Got to pay a fee.  Parking? $28 per day Valet? $49 The list goes on.;4
Great location close to Empire State Building, Macys and walking distance to Times Square. Tic Tock diner attached to the hotel good food and quite reasonable. Rooms in hotel are small but adequate for 2. Security is good in the hotel.  The staff on reception are unfriendly we had a problem and they were completely unsympathetic we had to ask to see a manager who was apologetic and helpful. There is a daily charge of $40 payable daily from your credit card some of which is for hotel amenities WiFi gym and business centre this adds substantially to the price.;4
I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews here. But after researching extensively - I went with Morning Side for its Location. I spent over a week here and it was extremely comfortable! I rented  a standard roon with pvt bath.  This is a decent and clean place. Yes the rooms are small- but thatâs Manhattan. The place is perfect if you are looking for a affordable  yet comfortable & safe place to stay in Mahattan ( wh is super expensive) I did use a shared bath for one night and it was OK too! The staff and esp Pat is extremely hospitable.  The location is very lively and safe which is great!;4
A very good hotel! Excellent rates for the area and great location in Time Square. Very friendly staff. Would recommend if you are looking for a hotel close to everything at a good price. Restaurants, bars, and shopping are within walking distance.;4
Our first trip to the USA and we started at LA at the Hollywood Hotel. The front staff couldn't have been any more helpful or pleasant. We really appreciated their help a few times. Our room 326 was great - very quiet and nicely appointed. The only drawback was the hot water in the bathroom was a bit hit and miss. We did notify the front desk of this but it wasn't fixed. But if that was our only problem we were lucky. The hotel is close to a small shopping mall and supermarket. Transport isn't far away. The buffet breakfast was nice but we probably would have enjoyed bacon and eggs. The only egg dishes they did were omelettes or scrambled eggs, However it was still enjoyable. The chefs behind the bain marie were very friendly as was everyone we met at the hotel - from the;4
We got a day pass for a daybed through ResortPass for the day.  Check in was quick and easy at the front desk. The lady at the front desk who checked us in wasnât the friendliest, but she got us what we needed and sent us on our way.   Pool staff- we were greeted and shown to our daybed.  Itâs on a first come basis so get there early if you have a preference on which daybed you want. Same goes for the cabanaâs.   Kitchen- lunch service was very slow.  We had to check on our order as it didnât show up at the estimated time given when ordering.  The kitchen needs help and QC.  Once we got our food one of the sandwiches that we ordered was missing half of the ingredients that were listed on the menu.  We werenât expecting much, but what we got was very disappointing.   Pool;4
I stayed here overnight for an interview. Great location if you're looking to stay near/walkable distance from the CHLA & Kaiser Permanente hospitals. Parking space is available for about $29/day. Otherwise, nearby street parking may be hard to find. Overall, the room was good--clean, quiet, with a nice view of the courtyard. Service was also excellent. In particular, Nicole at the front desk was very nice and made me feel welcome ever since I checked in. The next morning after checkout, she personally helped me promptly store my luggage and wished me good luck on my interview. Hollywood hotel also sent me an email to redeem a complimentary beverage (but I unfortunately didn't end up using this). Overall, I had an excellent stay at this hotel and would highly recommend.;4
We went on our first NYC trip last year (just getting around to writing a review) and stayed at this beautiful hotel, we weren't sure what to expect as we'd never been to NYC before but wow, as soon as you walk in it is so grand. We had a run in with one of the hotel staff members on the check in desk who was quite rude and abrupt and wasn't very good at explaining things so we ended up having to come down again after we'd realised something had gone wrong and talk to a manager as we were going to be out of pocket $200 with no warning whatsoever, and the staff member wasn't taking no as an answer, this was sorted promptly by the manager who couldn't have been more lovely. Although this is just a small niggle. The hotel itself is amazing and I would stay here again in a;4
Tiny room but comfortable & clean & bright with a good air conditioner & T.V. Refrigerator is also in the room!!But no coffee maker is there though it is listed :(. Bathroom is neat & clean. Very Good location. Just 2 blocks from subway & major bus stand is just 1 block. Columbia university & Cathedral Church is very close.Clean & quiet & safe neighborhood. I would strongly recommend this hotel for a quick night.;4
We arrived at the Hilton Universal around 9pm on a Wednesday, we were checked into our room by friendly front desk staff and on our way up to our room within 10minutes. We stayed on the 17th floor facing Universal and City walk, amazing view!!  We had a big room with 2 queen size beds which were very comfortable. There was a desk with chair and another comfort chair that could be moved. The bathroom was spacious as well, the room was not 'new' which was definitely ok because it was nice and clean and obviously looked after. The housekeeping staff were great! The TV was average, which didn't matter because we weren't in LA to watch it, there was lots of choices to watch if we had wanted to though.  There was an elevator that was being fixed so we did have to wait a bit at times;4
"The good: Value (Excellent bang for your buck); Location (3 blocks from Central Park; Subway Station across the street; 24 hr Pharmacy next door; Good food across the street and in surrounding streets; quiet, safe neighborhood); Service (friendly and helpful staff); Clean. The bad: Location (If you want to walk to major Manhattan attractions, except Central Park, this is NOT the best choice); Outdated (the property and rooms are old, but well kept; Old TV in room, very few electric plugs); Bed (too soft and in need of replacement, in my opinion). I had a very good experience at this hotel.  The good overweight the bad by far.  I definitely recommend it.";4
One of my son's and I decided to do a weekend in New York to take in as much theater as we could. We were able to book the Hotel Empire , which is just across from the Lincoln Center. Also, you are very close to Columbus Circle and Central Park. We had driven into the city and there is a parking garage nearby with a hotel rate of $40 a day, which is reasonable rate in NYC. Both of us like to walk and enjoyed strolling around the neighborhood. The room was clean and the staff was great. The shower was fantastic for someone tall like myself, the shower head comes directly out of the ceiling. However, there is only one shower door making it difficult to keep all the water inside the shower. (this is not by accident, I asked the staff and all the rooms only have one door) The room;4
Overall good.  Several upgrades to the property including thermostats and improved heat and AC.  Great location across the street from Lincoln Center.  Could still be upgrades to newer, but it has been improved since last year.;4
I stayed there for Christmas, when there are a lot of tourists from other countries also in the hotel. People there are very friendly and patient to non-English speakers.  My room is kind of small but is clean and tidy. It has two windows and the view is great from 20th floor.  Location is great great, very convenient to the train stations, port authority bus station, penn station and time square.  One thing I don't like is, because the building is very old, there is a little bit smell in the corridor. Except that, everything else is good.;4
We stayed here while visiting friends in the city. The location was great. Close to subway stations, Central Park, Time Warner building. Lots of shops near by. Starbucks and a drugstore right around the corner. I thought the room was a great size for NYC. Bathroom was small but functional. We had a room a few floors up away from the elevators facing the Lincon Center. Nice and quiet with the noise you would expect staying in NYC. Overall had a great experience. Would definitely stay here again.;4
The location is very good if you want to be close to universal. The staff are good and the food is excellent. The buffet was awesome and I wish I had breakfast there since they serve a Japanese style menu. Pool is outdoors and heated, good till midnight. 10 min easy walk to Universal. Peteâs coffee is inside the hotel and the woman that served me twice each morning was A+ for service and friendliness. Definitely will be back.;4
Travelled some years ago in the month of January, Well situated within walking distance of Times Square, Macey's, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden.  Room was on the small size but adequate, staff friendly and polite with nice coffee shop in the foyer.;4
We booked here because this was our final destination of our Route 66 trip and it's claims to be on Route 66 with a few 66 themes.  The Hotel is lovely but I still feel a little over priced, the area it is situated in has an extremely high amount of homeless people on the street so going out on the evening was a little concerning.  We stayed for 3 nights and was happy with our room, the pool area was nice to but quite small and a little dated with bad taste of 80's music playing.  The bar staff were great and we stayed one evening for the comedy which was pretty cool to but some comedians were too political and that isn't comedy for me.  Overall, the Hotel is nice but just in the wrong area;4
The location of this hotel is wonderful with proximity to restaurants, cafes, great shopping, lincoln centre, Central Park.....you can't go wrong!  Staff at this hotel are outstanding, may have to do with the management team at this hotel.  I had stayed at other Morgan properties and they can take a few pointers from the Empire hotel.  One minor observation is the hotel  should have someone answering the phone at reception, we tried calling several times during the course of our stay, but no one would pick up.    Rooms are fine, no issues with noise in the room we stayed in,  but the bathroom was very small, in fact so  small you have to take care that your toiletries don't fall into the  toilet......  Internet in the room is expensive but free in the lobby, good business centre;4
This smart retro building on the upper west side is in a handy location if you want to hang-out within easy reach of the shops and museums of uptown. And it's a nifty five minute walk to Central Park when you need to escape the traffic, or join the cityâs army of exercise fanatics. Rooms are smart and tasteful, with enough idiosyncratic design to make you feel you're in a smart chic boutique, despite the hotel's significant size.   I was upgraded to a large room on the 3rd floor which had space to work comfortably and even do a bit of yoga without knocking myself out. And the free wifi was a relief having been outrageously charged by hotels too often recently. Annoyingly you have to keep putting the passcode in when using a mobile device, which seemed pointless and after three;4
The hotel staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.  Located close to Penn Station.  The rooms were clean and nicely renovated.  I was visiting for work travel and this is definitely a tourist hotel.;4
The hotel is very easy to find, and accessible too (metro train and bus(.  I booked the hotel based on the reviews posted by contributors here at TripAdvisor!  And I didn't regret it.  It's everything that the other guests said it was great for - location, plenty of restaurants to choose from, quick check-in and check-out process, good (not great) breakfast.  True that Hugo's eggs are really good!  Must try when you come to this hotel. :)  The room is big enough.  Beds are huge, but a bit too high. That didn't bother me at all as I was sleeping like a baby on the 2 nights that we stayed here.  Bath tab a bit small, and heating of water takes a few minutes.  But we don't mind at all as long as there's hot water.  Room internet a bit weak, but we stayed out most of the time;4
First things first, we had a good bargain with this hotel. This is not a five star hotel but a nice cheap, clean and convenient hotel. It's what we were looking for and didn't disappoint.  The red line metro underground station is a five minute walk so that means it's easy to get to most places in Hollywood or even LA. Perfect for non drivers like myself.  The room was clean with good air conditioning.  Free breakfast was good.  Lots of shops & fast food in the area.  Didn't actually realise there was a pool, didn't see any signs for it because we would've used it a couple weeks of times.  No safe in my room but there are some in certain rooms but I never needed it anyway as nothing was touched.  I would use again and recommend to anyone on a budget.;4
If you are looking for a hotel near Universal Studios, this is the best option. This hotel is very near to it. Although, there's a shuttle from the hotel to universal studios, you can actually just walk and you're already there.   I just hope that there will be a shuttle from the hotel to the universal city red line station because it is quite a distance to walk down from the hotel to the lankershim blvd.;4
The biggest thing this hotel has going for it is the convenience - right in the middle of everything - and for us coming in to NYC by train, a stone's throw from Penn Station.  That's why we've chosen it twice in the last 10 years.  Checkin was a wait on a Saturday afternoon, but the front desk staff were very nice.  The room was very clean, but quite small.  The bathroom even tinier.  But it worked for one night with two people, and it was blessedly quiet on the 8th floor.  Checkout was easy the next morning too.  The only real complaint we had was that we had left our two bags with the storage dept. ($2/bag storage fee) as we had time for a quick museum tour before catching our train at noon.  When we returned to the hotel at 11:30 to pick them up we encountered a HUGE long;4
I recommend staying at Hollywood Hotel! Arrival from airport is super easy and convent. Itâs about a 20-30 minute ride from LAX - I had a late arrival from delayed flight late but staff was very helpful and checkin was a breeze.   The location of the hotel is perfect. Just around the corner from Santa Monica BLVD / Hollywood BLVD / Sunset and more- Easy access with or without GPS- for walking, driving, and riding.   Fanny is host of the restaurant cafe. She greets with a friendly smile and was very helpful with seating. There are huge varieties of breakfast options and treats, that seemed to keep replenishing and coming. The Chef was amazing! Chef Hugo cooked different variations of omelets and waffles. The build you own option is AWESOME! Chef Hugoâs creations were a staple to;4
"The location was great, super close to one of the main subway stations. A short 20 minute ride to Times Square. The hotel is located in a more quiet area and it is walking distance to Central Park. If you are looking for just a place to spend the night, this hotel is perfect as it is very affordable. If you are looking for luxury then this is not your hotel. The walls were very thin, bed was not the most comfortable and it made noises every time I would move and the pipes made a lot of noise; but for us it was perfect for what we needed.  The room had a mini fridge which came in very handy. This hotel is also a hostel and they have rooms with a shared bathroom, so if you don't want to share a bathroom make sure you request a room with a private bathroom when making your";4
Pros: -Service - overall had a good experience with service at the front desk and at the lobby bar.  And the doormen were great with taxis. -Location - this isn't a part of NYC I normally stay in (usually stay in LES) but thought it was a good area - lots near by and pretty views. -Room - overall the room was nice - there was enough room for a queen bed, a small table and a chair - compact but not overly small especially given the price.  Cons: -Bathroom was super tiny.  At first I didn't mind, but then was annoyed with zero counter space (it was literally just the sink basin), and when showering, water got everywhere (didn't help that they didn't provide a bath mat). -Not business friendly - when I can't find an outlet anywhere, then I know they're not built for business;4
Very good service, nice staff but a minus for the internet, the rooftop bar and the small room.;4
This was our second time staying at this hotel during the Westminster Dog Show week.  The hotel offers shuttle buses to the Piers for Breed judging and is right across the street from MSG for the Group judging and BIS so it works out well for exhibitors.  It isn't the glitziest hotel but it's clean and well run.  Both the diner and the Trattoria serve great food.  Most importantly, the staff are phenomenal.  Kudos especially to Joe the valet who, in addition to giving us terrific service, really took an interest in us and our dog.  It made our trip to New York all that much more enjoyable.;4
Hilton is a hilton hotel. and this was no exception. I always good excellent service at the hiltons. Good location, good food, excellent staff, clean and secuire. What else do you need at the hotel. will come back again..;4
Near the trains, near Central Park, Price is reasonable  I would use this property again because of accessibility and coziness of the experience.   However, I had issues with the AC on the room and had to transfer three times because of it.;4
My family and I had an enjoyable stay at the Hilton.  The rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable.  We loved that they provided a shuttle bus up to the Universal City Walk every 15 minutes.  It was a nice quiet area and although the pool was not overly big it was not too crowded.;4
The hotel is located right on the public transport routes, few mins walk to metro station and bus stop. But i would still recommend to use your own car. During the check out, the lady receptionist being helpful by letting us to use their office for storing luggages few hours. The free breakfast is a plus.;4
The location of this hotel for is great for any performances at the Lincoln Center. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are TINY, but its clean and you can't beat the location. The lobby bar was fun with locals and travelers mixing well. The restaurant on the mezzanine floor was great too!;4
I found this through Booking.com.  It was just a mile away from my son's place.  Once here,  you really don't need a car if you're a good walker.  You can get to Griffith's Park,  the Metro,  Silverlake,  Los Feliz,  and attractions in Hollywood easily.  The breakfast included omelets.  Just watch out for the taxes when looking at the cost.  I either missed it or it wasn't mentioned when I calculated the total.;4
We chose this hotel because of it's style and location. Walking distance to Madison SQ Garden, Penn Station, B&H photo, Empire State. Remember this isn't the most modern hotel, but it's been kept fresh and clean. Things like abundance of outlets and lots of room around the bathroom sink aren't why you come to this kind of hotel. The diner on the ground floor, Tic Toc Diner is a GREAT value and convenient.;4
Wyndham New Yorker.  Clean and cozy room. Staff was awesome and the tic tick good food.  Lovely lobby to sit and people watch.  Close to everything to do in the city.  The doorman had taxis ready and available at all times.;4
Always stay here on business. Great location for mid-town business connections but also for Times Square and Central Park, both just a short walk away. Comfortable place to stay, very clean. All the staff are very helpful and friendly - particularly Jeff, who sorted out my luggage and taxi with professional ease and good humour.;4
The Morningside Inn is situated in a great part of the Upper West Side for travelers. It is only 3 blocks north or south of the subway entrance being 110th on Broadway or 103rd   on Broadway which puts you on the red line. We had room 106 which is on the bottom floor & as it was close to the elevator a few times it was a bit noisy but no real problem. The room was neat & tidy with two double beds, fridge, R/C A/C, shower in the bath,flat screen TV, ceiling fan hand basin & bar heater. Small items of repair that the room needs are: tiles coming up in floor of bathroom, security chain on the door needs to be replaced, door lock & latch on entrance door to the room need to be replaced as while they where function able, the door did not close entirely. There is a communal Kitchen;4
Stayed her for our 'mini-moon' for 4 nights over New Years. Great lobby, room was nice albiet a small bathroom - space for one person and that's it, had complimentary strawberries and chocolate brought up to us the first night. 25min walk to Times Square, just over the road from Central Park. The concierge's were fantastic, so friendly and knowledgeable! Busy on new years eve but that was due to hotel NYE party upstairs, didn't bother us, we still had a sleep up until 11pm and then went out to central park for midnight fireworks!!;4
Very nice hotel located just blocks from Times Square, Central Park, and Theater District. Great location for business or pleasure. Clean rooms, excellent staff, and fairly priced.  Easy access from LaGuardia or Newark Airportd;4
My husband and I had a terrific stay at Empire Hotel next to the Lincoln Center. The staff was great (thank you, Luis) and we even had a view of the fountain at Lincoln Center. Though the bathroom was small, the shower was big and the waterfall shower maintained hot water for a nice, long shower. The views from the roof are gorgeous, and we liked the boutique feel of it so much, we're returning with friends to the hotel next weekend. Great walking distance of so many things and great restaurants! Really enjoyed Cafe Fiorello across the street.;4
"The location can't be beat; right across the street from Lincoln Center. Great restaurants all around. The price for a late winter break was pretty amazing as well. Starting at the entrance, the guys who work the front door are great. Friendly, helpful, and always available.  The front desk staff were efficient and courteous.  Checking in was a breeze, and getting a replacement for a de-magnetized key at 1 am took seconds. The lobby bar was nice, but table service was slow. I was in a double room on the second floor (2 queen sized beds). Nicely decorated, but some wear and tear on the furniture. Not much room between the bed and the desk, getting in and out of the bathroom was a squeeze (NOT wheelchair or walker - friendly). Standard mini-bar.  Keurig for coffee, but I didn't";4
Perfect location for Lincoln Center.  Concierge made reservations at two wonderful nearby restaurants and car service to make an early flight.  Room was small but adequate with two double beds for friends sharing.  Exceptionally clean.  Quiet room, despite central location.  Decent view of Manhattan.  Agreeable, helpful staff.  Bellman ran out to 7th Ave to get a cab when needed in pouring rain--much appreciated.;4
I had a early check-in but the room was a closet.   I asked to be m9ved to a larger room, which I was and was pleased.;4
"Stayed here for the Teen Choice Awards.  Got a King alcove room which overlooks the 101 Freeway.  This room is roomy with a king size bed, desk, sofa sleeper, ref,  coffee table, flat screen, and even more additional seating!  We housed two adults, two teens, and a five year old for one night and it met our needs.  I would say the hotel is due for  a refresh as the lobby decor pays homage to the 80s.  We came on a Sunday afternoon and didn't know that this was the place for all you can eat lobster tails, crab legs, and much more!  It looked like there were many locals that were in the know of the Sunday event; try it, i don't think you'd be disappointed.  We used the pool and I can see how you would want to cool off after a day in the park; they have cabanas, a bar, and grill";4
I stayed at the Empire recently for a girls weekend in NYC.  Great hotel and would definitely stay there again.  I have stayed in tons of NYC hotels over the years and used to live in the city so I know what to expect.  Since two of us used to live in NYC and the third friend had been many times, we weren't really looking for a tourist hotel but rather someplace hip and trendy (and it had to have roof top pool) that wouldn't completely break the bank.  The roof top pool was a requirement since it was July and our plan was to chill out during the day and live it up a bit at night.  There are not a lot of options for a roof-top pool in NYC, but this was a total find.  The location was ideal for our plans and the price was reasonable, plus had a great overnight parking deal.    The;4
Comfortable beds, very clean. Steps away from Starbucks for early morning coffee. If you are going to Lincoln Center for a show, you need to stay here. It is so convenient and you can see the hotel from Lincoln Center. Bathroom was small and shower is unusual. The sliding door has been removed and when I took a shower, water splashed all around the room. I inquired at the front desk and was told that was the design. If I hadn't removed the toilet paper before I showered, it would have been soaked. A little strange in my opinion.;4
Stayed April 2014, 9th Floor.  King room had excellent view of Universal City Walk.  The day of my arrival, I was able to enjoy sites at Universal from my room that included a small sprinkle of fireworks and a show that set someone on fire.  The room itself was spacious.  Bed was comfy.  Room had a fridge.  Bathroom was a nice size.  My only complaint about the room is that it could have been a tinge cleaner.  The shower/tub and the carpet (along baseboard) was not cleaned to my liking.  There were crumbs of some sort that were there upon my arrival and stayed the entire 6 days I was there.  Because of my work schedule, I was unable to enjoy the amenities (gym, pool, etc.).  The buffet looked scrumptious but was a bit too pricey for me.  I did eat at the bar one night and;4
The Ramada Inn Hollywood is a really clean, attractive hotel at a reasonable price. The only major problem with it is that it's a fair way out of the main tourist part of Hollywood. It took us about 30 minutes to walk to the Kodak Theatre area, but it is easily accessible by train which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The buffet breakfast was included in the rate and was great. There's also a laundry there you can use with an iron. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, it's a good hotel though not in the best area of Hollywood.;4
This hotel is about 15 minutes walk away from the nearest subway station, and it's really really close to the hudson river. The room that I stayed was probably the smallest hotel room I'd ever had stayed in, it's literally the size of a cabin on a train, which was interesting and unique. To be clear, I knew what I was walking into before I'd done my share of research before booking. Still, it's an eye-opening experience.   The bathroom was shared by many rooms, but whenever I used it, there's almost always nobody there (except in the morning). I was a little worried that it might be inconvenient to use a shared bathroom, but it's not a problem at all. And the bathroom was very clean.  As I mentioned, the hotel is really close to the hudson river, which is a huge plus on a sunny;4
Location is great. Room size varies (a lot). Newer bathrrooms and furnishings but ancient elevators. Many rooms have outside views of Lincoln Center, Broadway, or up Columbus Ave. Pool deck is small but unique. Several guests had small dogs with them, but check with hotel about its pet policy. Valet parking available.;4
We had an awesome time.  Loved the free upgrade to a suite.  Anete at the front desk was wonderful at check in.  The hotel is in an outstanding location, with so much nearby within walking distance.  The rooftop bar is terrific!  Truly a memorable time.;4
This is a fine NYC hotel.  It's all about location.  Directly across the street from Lincoln Center at the lower end of the UWS, it can't get a lot better.  There's a lot to do in the neighborhood and if you are a walker UWS and midtown are all easily accessible.  The room was fine and NYC smallish but not cramped.  Of particular note were the amenities in the room... in addition to the usual cashews and soft drinks ... fine wine, electronic adaptors in every shape... and condoms, lube, and other accessories.  Gotta love NYC.;4
I have been at the Empire Hotel for a two week stay.  I am an NYC native and know the city inside/out. The hotel is a special landmark. Almost 100 years old. With that comes fabulosity and also some challenges of course as well so one must take that into consideration and have an open mind. I will choose to focus more on the positives here. :) The bed and pillows are very comfortable. The shower hot and strong. The in room wifi very good. The bath products are great! The neighborhood is close to everything and very quiet for sleeping at night. The air conditioning works well and is quiet enough. The room is clean enough.   The mini refrigerator is cold. The pool deck and little pool are terrific! Made my stay as I am sun and pool person. The food and drinks are fine. Much of the;4
"Booked this through Expedia, which did not reveal name of hotel until after non-refundable reservation was made.  Consequently was not privy to past reviews until I was committed to stay.  When I was able to read reviews, my first thought was ""Oh-oh!!!""  But to my relief, I waspleasantly surprised!  My room was a bit small, but it had everything I needed.  It was clean, well stocked with necessities and essentials and provided an excellent view.  The bed was very comfortable.  The staff was beyond exceptional.  My check-in began with Michelene who was very pleasant and accommodating.  Later I indulged on the services of the concierge, Chris, who went out of his way to be helpful.  Emanuel patiently helped me resolve some questions I had at check out, and finally Yuri, also of";4
After reading reviews of this hotel, i was worried about what we were going find. Once arrived at the hotel, i found the staff were very helpful and friendly whilst checking us in to a suitable room. The room was quite spacious, clean and not at all dirty as previously claimed in other reviews. The rooms were cleaned every day with fresh towels and bed linen. The only bad thing about this hotel is the location. Although there are many shops and restaurants nearby, it is quite far away from most attractions which have to be reached by the subway.;4
Love that the location was perfect and was able to take a shuttle to and from the hotel from the Airport. They also remodeled the rooms to a modern and fresh look with a great view of Los Angeles. My son enjoyed the meal they offered and there was plenty of seating space for people to eat either in the bar or near lobby for their meals.;4
I stayed with my daughters for a holiday trip to NYC.    The location is great. Itâs very busy this time of year and was extremely cold.   A busy dinner is right next door open 24/7 .   It was difficult getting Uber or a taxi so your best bet is the Subway. Easy ride to Rockefeller Center.   The hotel is within walking distance to Herald Square and if itâs not to cold you can walk to Times Square. The blocks are long though.  We had a double room which was renovated but not the bathrooms. Bathrooms were old but adequate. The beds were comfortable. We had problems with the heat the first night so it was very cold in the room. We were freezing all night. There are no blankets -only a very thin cover.   My other daughter had a King Bed in a renovated room with a newer bathroom. She;4
Hotel conveniently located close to the up and coming meat packing district. Small rooms of which many don't have bath or toilet but with very clean and accessible shared baths and toilets. Very nice cafÃ© and night club.;4
We chose this hotel due to its proximity to Penn Station - this made it really easy to find after getting the train from Newark Airport. I thinks its always a good idea to minimise time faffing around trying to find the hotel and maximise time spent enjoying the holiday!  The room was not large, but plenty big enough for a weekend break in NYC. The bed was comfy and the shower was hot. The staff were exceptional and always went above and beyond to help us out. This really made the stay a lot more enjoyable.  Don't bother with the diner that is attached to the hotel, we tried it for breakfast one day and it served the purpose but there are plenty of better places to eat nearby. Just ask the concierge!;4
I stayed for one night in a âcorner suiteâ to attend an opera at Lincoln Center.  This hotel is located right across the street from the Lincoln Center plaza.  It is also just a couple of blocks from Central Park. The suite was on the top floor (11) and had a nice view of the surrounding area. There were two separate rooms, two bathrooms, one with a deep tub, and a comfortable living room with a mini-refrigerator. The room was very clean when I arrived. There were two televisions, one in the living room and one in the bedroom, but the bedroom tv didnât work.  The room had a safe, a couple of umbrellas, and a coffee maker. There were two complimentary bottles of water. Internet service was included with a $20 âresidence fee.â  Check in and check out were efficient and doormen;4
Cecile and Nancy where so kind and helpful while I stayed in LA. Thank you for watching out for me and your great customer service. Keep up the great work ladies you both deserve a raise! Blessings to your amazing success!;4
I think the New Yorker will always hold a special place in my heart as when we were in New York my fiancÃ© popped the question ! However the hotel itself was lovely. The security was good not allowing those into lifts without showing your card and all staff were always more than happy to help. The hotel was clean in all areas and I loved how they have kept some of the old school features of the hotel. It was a perfect location to be out of all the madness and relax of a night time but still only a do minutes walk to all the desirable shops and tourist attractions. When we return to New York I would 100% stay again. Thank you for an amazing and memorable stay.;4
Me and my wife stayed here for 1 week in oktober 2014. This hotell has a central location, near the metro and in the neighborhood og Chinatown. No bar, no breakfast but ok. We will use this next time too. Nice staff, but simple service, near several breakfast cafees.;4
Its Like living in NY. close shops for shopping food, 3 blocks to subway, quiet. Loved Zabars up the street right by Cental park too. Lovely location away for hustle and bustle, but not that far by subway toTimes Square.;4
We stayed there, family of 4. Great hotel staff. Everybody is verry friendly and good location. The metro is just 2 min. walk from the hotel were you have easy acess to Univetsal Studios and also Hollywood walk of Fame. O, and the best complimantary breakfast and omlette made by Ugo!! Highly remomended.ðð¤©  Louise, Isreal;4
"This was our first time at Ameritania. The front desk offered me an ""upgrade"" of a larger room with 2 beds but it ended up being beds that were each too small to sleep two people, so hardly an upgrade. I think they needed more Queen beds which were our original reservation. Otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars. Otherwise, it's a great hotel. It's right next to the Colbert show and just blocks from Times Square and the subway where you can get anywhere easily. Central Park was just 4 blocks away so we could go running in the mornings.";4
An excellent option for a trip to Universal Studios. The staff are friendly and provided excellent service.  The porter and concierge both showed interest in our enquires and then considered advice.  We would be happy to recommend the Hilton at Universal Studios.;4
The hotel is dated but the price is right and we still liked it  Clean larger rooms they catered to all our requests eg we wanted a rollaway bed and they didnât charge us for it  The breakfast was good the front desk were great and very helpful We spent NYE around the pool it was a great atmosphere we enjoyed lovely champagne and snacks not too over priced.  The pool was heated so the children really enjoyed swimming even though it was winter.;4
The building is old but the rooms are a nice size and seemed clean. I loved the suite it had 2 tvs which was awesome traveling with children. Its in a convenient location and the staff was nice. I would stay again.;4
I blew into the city late on a Sunday evening for Monday meetings. I had arranged to stay with family who found themselves in Philadelphia and not in New York due to complications. It is Fashion Week. Could there be a room anywhere I the Upper Westside at 10 PM? YES! Yes, there was and The Empire had it. In the Lobby, I walked into Fashion Week. Gorgeous and extremely well dressed, and extremely dressed, woman were everywhere. Eye candy each and every one. Nick, at the front desk, was himself well dressed, charming and funny.  My room is well designed. There is a rain head shower that was a delight. The bed (it which I am laying at this moment) is comfortable, the location is convenient, and there is valet parking, but I opted to park on the street on 61st. The Priceline -name;4
"Our family stayed at the Empire for a birthday celebration. The hotel has ""trendy"" decorations and ""mood"" (dark) lighting.  The wallpaper in the hallways has bare trees on a brown background.  Our 8th floor room was ready when we arrived, and yes, it was small. The color scheme is brown, brown and more brown, which my son did not like. We had a room with two double beds, a two-draw dresser, sort of a desk and a tiger print chair in the corner.  No coffee maker (Starbucks was around the corner) but lots of expensive in room snacks and accessories, which we ignored. With a 24 hour Duane Reade right around the corner, why spend $9 for one large bottle of Fuji Water when DR was selling the same thing, two for $3! A tiny safe and an honor bar was in the doorless tiny closet.  The";4
Stayed here for 4 days with my wife and two children (10 and 13) as part of a weeklong trip to California.  The 15 minute ride from Burbank airport and proximity to Universal Studios made this great choice for a family vacation to the LA area.    Easy access to most highways make day trips around the city easy (for LA that is).  The rooms are average Hilton size, clean and comfortable.  The staff is pleasant and helpful.  There is a shuttle to Universal City Walk the runs every 15 minutes if you don't want to take the 10 minute walk.  The only negative was the lack of hot water late one evening.  This was corrected by the morning.  Executive floor rooms or Hilton Gold members have access to the executive level lounge which provides a continental breakfast.  Great choice if you;4
It would be nice to have complimentary wifi in the room, as most other hotels around the country/world have. Overall, we had a pleasant stay.                             xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;4
I have stayed here in august 2016 for five days . The best thing about this hotel is that location location location the subway  station is very near to the hotel and you can take it to walk of fames universal studios union station .the room was clean   And not wide and the breakfast was good  .;4
I'm now on my last night staying at the Empire hotel - and I have to say - it's great!   There are a few bits and pieces that you'd want fixed (e.g. the doors don't close properly on their own, so it's happened a few times that the employees have knocked and asked if it was left open by mistake - awesome service though!), but it's overall a great place to stay in New York! Location is amazing - and for the price - awesome!   Kudos to Zuli for help with great breakfast!;4
We were a little nervous after booking but up on arrival, we were relieved. Ronald, the Bell man was really nice and helpful, all the staff from check in to check out was pleasant and helpful. When we arrived, the front desk staff upgraded us to a King room at no additional charge, this was great. Great room(1111), people were saying how slow the elevators were, not the fastest, but more than adequate. They were nice, and clean. We traveled the subway everywhere we went, from Brooklyn to the Bronx. This was really convenient as there was subway stations just a few steps from the hotel. There are a lot of great restaurants close by(walking distance), drug stores, convenience stores, really great location with a reasonable price. In room safe was large enough for a 17 inch laptop,;4
Very good room and service.  Will come back in the future. Only adjustment necessary is to improve elevators, not all of them working and rather slow. I have found staff and mangers accessible and helpful.;4
This hotel is probably not a great choice for everyone but I enjoyed my one night stay. Great staff, easy check in and out, cool bar in the lobby. Room was tiny with very tiny bathroom but nice. Bed was hard, not very comfortable. Very convenient location...literally just steps from Lincoln Center.;4
I stayed at The Jane for 7 nights.  Whilst incredibly apprehensive about the small single room, after a night or two, I loved it.  The shared bathroom didn't bother me and I never had to wait for a shower or toilet.  I was on level 4 and recommend that as it is in the middle of the building and away from the nightclub (Thurs, Fri, Sat) and the rooftop bar.  The Old Rose cafe on the ground floor has a fantastic breakfast and evening atmosphere.  All staff were really helpful, friendly and welcoming.  The hotel can be noisy when the nightclub is operating, as well as when people who don't think to close their room door quietly (at any hour).  I would recommend The Jane and definitely stay again.;4
I like the hotel, its location, the 30ths atmosphere and settings?But at times the age of the building and the infrastructure shows.  We had a spacious corner room (great) but the cold was barely held out by the windows, we had to close the curtains to make the room a bit warmer. The room was huge  ( we are in New York remember) but unfortunately the request for a small extra table was not granted, this would have allowed us to work a bit more comfortable during the two weeks stay with two digital nomads. Lovely staff of course but the place can get fairly busy.;4
Wasn't a fan of the tile flooring, the restroom was proportioned different then normal and the bed was extremely hard. I did see they were doing more renovations around the property which is good to see. But for the price you couldn't beat it;4
Stayed here in May 2013, got upgraded on arrival to a Superior King which was a lovely big room with a big comfy bed. Very cool decor and the hotel has a funky feel to it. Was a shame the roof terrace wasnt open so didnt get to see that. Check in and Out was easy, leaving our bags on the last day not a problem and the location is really good. Would totally recommend this hotel.;4
I stayed in this hotel with my brother for four days. Although the accommodations are quite simple (agreeing with the price), the hotel's staff was extremely friendly  and competent. Everyone constantly asked if we were finding everything all right and were always prompt to help: providing extra towels, or simply information about the airport shuttle and how to use the metro efficiently... The location is really nice because it's right in front of Central Park, and also from a two minute walk of a subway station. I highly recommend Astor on the Park to whomever wants to spend sometime in New York city without spending much, but having a comfortable place to rest.;4
I stayed at the Hilton with my husband for 2 days. The room was very clean and we had Ã  very nice view of the houses in the mountain. The staff was very curtious, helpful and friendly. I felt very confortable. You are very close to universal studio. You are at one subway stop from the walk of fame. Everything is pretty close.  We had breakfast at the Sierra cafÃ© down in the hotel. Breakfast buffet for 2 with tip included is about 65$... I find that it was very expensive but have to admit that it was very good. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would fo back in a flash!:);4
This was a 'girls' trip celebrating a 70th birthday.   Would like to especially compliment the Concierges...helped us with dinner reservations, tours and always willing to answer any question no matter how crazy!;4
The hotel is spotless and the staff are exceedingly courteous and friendly, help with trips and tours was first class.  We had room only. Location is great for the Lincoln Centre, Times Square is a 15 minute walk.  The only problem we had was with a room meal.;4
We were checked in by Mohammed, who was extremely efficient, Great Hotel, yes the rooms were small, however the beds and pillows are very comfortable, but a fabulous location, near Madison Square Gardens, Macys, Penn Station and the Red bu routes, easy walking distance to Times Square and Broadway. Both restaurants on site are very good, and the Italian a life saver after a long day out, with a good meal and wine on the doorstep. If you have booked here you will not be disappointed, and free wifi. One tip when out and about eating ask what is their service charge, it could add an extra 20% to it, we were caught and it added another 75 dollars to our bill.;4
I reserved the executive suite. I was surprised to see it was very small but the upgrades done to the room and the look of the room was beautiful.  The staff were so very nice and really welcoming.;4
Wouldn't hesitate to return. Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Family of 4 with 2 grown teenagers. Hotel facilities were very good. Good location on a bus and train route ideal for travelling. Felt safe walking about the local area which had supermarket and many places to get food from at a good price. Great little shop on site and not over priced. All areas of the hotel were very well maintained. Room was great decor and size. Bathroom amazing. Clean throughout hotel with frequent maid service. Pool area great with an abundance of fresh towels. All staff fantastic, polite and helpful. Breakfast was great too, surprised by amount of choice as it states it is complimentary only expected a basic continental but was much more with a chef at hand making any kind of egg including;4
I stayed here in feb of this year and it was great! the only issue was many cab drivers did not know where the hotel was so we made sure we had the hotels card on us! apart from that it was great! free breakfast cooked by hugo was great, huge beds, great reception staff. Hollywood boulevard is a couple of stops on the subway and is so cheap!;4
This hotel is great for a single traveler like myself! It's location is great and the price is right. For a short stay it's perfect. For a longer stay I would indeed miss a private bath and a more comfortable bed....but I found it great for a night. The history of the building is really cool too.;4
The hotel is located on the upper west side Central Park is across the street, bus and train station are nearby. Our room was small good enough for my wife and I, the bathroom was neat and so was our bed. No bedbugs so was a plus. If you are going to New York you shouldn't get anything fancy anyways we barely spent anytime in it. We stayed on the fifth floor so if we needed ice had to go to the basement. Overall, it was pretty decent and worth it.;4
The hotel, the stuff and the rooms are great. Also the pool deck is one of kind and a must see there. I have the feeling that the value is great when you book via an online portal, but in the room it said that it costs normally 759 $/night which is too much.;4
My husband and I booked this hotel for 2 nights on arrival preparing for the marathon. As we were coming as part of an International Travel Partner, the following 3 nights were with a different hotel that we weren't overly keen on so we wanted our first couple of nights to be at nearby hotel so the commute would be easy.  We arrived quite late on a Wednesday evening and check in was a breeze. We had a king room on the 11th floor facing another building and we didn't get any street noise. I'm not one to want to stay in or around Times Square but I was happy with the location of the Ameritania as it was easy to get to multiple subway stops and just a short stroll from Central Park.  NYC rooms are notoriously small but our room was perfectly serviceable. There were a few bits and;4
I was in transit to Nova Scotia and stayed one night in NY. The plane was delayed so I ended up having little time both in NY and at the Jane. Yes, the room is miniscule but it was comfortable and the washrooms clean. The staff are friendly and helpful. I didn't have time to do much else other than grab a dozen bagels from the cafe around the corner on the way to the airport. But you really only need a bed when you are in the city that never sleeps.;4
We needed a room for 1 night only and didn't check in until late so we opted for cheap and cheerful. The accommodation is more like a hostel but I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the rooms which all looked newly refurbished. We booked a double room but I have to say the bed was not big enough and we ended up topping and tailing! There was a fridge and cups and plates but you have to go to the communal  room to watch TV. There were also PC's available for use and wifi cost Â£1 per hour. All in all this was suitable for our short term needs but I think it's ideal for young back packers wanting a cheap central location from which to see the sights.;4
Everything was as I expected.  Room and bathroom were clean but used body wash container was half empty.  Had at very good night sleep and breakfast was very good.  Quite convenient to LAX and shuttle was prompt to and from the airport;4
I wasn't to sure about the hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is a couple of blocks from Hollywood Walk of Fame and typical tourist places. The mattresses are dreamy. The only thing that I found wrong was that there was one tiny shelf in the shower to hold my bottles. It could have used another shelf or a bigger one. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. If you don't want to park on the street, the parking is 24.00 a day. We paid it, because I didn't want to leave a rental car on the street. Great place to stay and a reasonable price for Los Angeles.;4
Easy walk to Time Square, all Broadway theatres, supermarkets, starbucks across the street, & subway stations.  Rooms are small but neat, modern & clean - great because there's too much to see in NYC to be spending all your time in your hotel room!;4
Friendliest staff around. Decent accommodations and amenities. Terrific location. Bizarre wallpaper definitely a conversation piece. Good buffet breakfast in rooftop lounge a definite asset. Reasonable parking access. Would come back anytime.;4
When I first heard of the Empire several decades ago, it still offered generous discounts to academics, but then became quite expensive under subsequent management.  On a lark, I checked rates for Christmas Eve and it was quite affordable, $148 including taxes for a small room with a queen bed.  It was calm and clean, and had everything I needed except a coffeemaker.  I will definitely try to return when my schedule and the rates align.  When I return, I will make sure to be hungry in the morning and splurge on the rooftop breakfast buffet.  It looked to be worth $25.  The hotel staff and the restaurant staff (two separate businesses) were all lovely.;4
The hotel is wonderfully located in the Central Park North area. An easy walk to St John the Divine Cathedral, Columbia University and St. Lukes Hospital. Located right across from the west side of Central Park makes access to the park very easy. Thew room is on the smaller side but clean, neat and recently redecorated and it accommodates a queen size bed. The en suite bathroom is newly tiled, clean and includes tub/shower. The price was slightly under $160 a night including all taxes, which is quite reasonable for NYC.;4
Good hotel. Terrific position. Good restaurants and connections nearby. Nice staff. breakfast to be reviewed. Maybe also in the room the air condition system can be updated with more efficient one. Thank you Jeff!;4
Just over the road from penn station so it's a breeze getting here quickly from JFK. The art deco interior takes you back to years gone by and whilst the rooms are similarly dated and could do with a refresh they are perfectly clean and functional and the beds/pillows so comfortable. The location though is superb, views of the empire state building when you step out of the front door, steps away from several subway stations to get you all over NYC, 5 mins walk to macys, 10 mins to times square and a 30 min stroll to central park.;4
I do NOT agree with the negative reviews about this hotel.  In spite of such reviews, I decided to book this hotel for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprized with both the room and the friendliness and courtesy of the staff at all levels.  All special requests were catered to.  Had booked a Superior King room.  Most of the issues about rooms at this hotel must have been for the Standard room in terms of small size, etc.  I was very happy with the room size and the amenities.  Would return to this very centrally located hotel, exactly opposite the Lincoln Center, subway station, major shops, and a host of excellent cuisine restaurants!;4
I had a good time here. The employees were pleasant and the room was decent.  I wish they did breakfast.;4
The Ameritania Hotel in NYC is a great location for people looking for a hotel within walking distance of Times Square and Central Park. The location allows easy walking to both locations, Rockefeller Center, and multiple subway stations that make it easy to get around town. The service from the staff is excellent. The concierges were friendly, and the baggage handlers made sure to treat your bags properly if you needed them held for the day (shout out to Jeff who helped us out with our bags on multiple occasions in an excellent manor).   The complaints I will bring up is that some services, like wifi and breakfast, are pricey. I'm not a big fan of having to pay to use wifi at all at hotels. The other complaint is that you will hear the bustling streets all through the night. It;4
Great location close to the Columbus Circle station.  The staff was incredibly welcoming and an example of how to treat / help guests.   Rooms were cozy and ample for what I needed though the bathroom doors were fatigued as the laminate was peeling off.  That being said great value and great location;4
Yes....the rooms are really tiny - they were made to resemble the cabins on a cruise ship afterall...and that is what they feel like (only a lot smaller than today's cruise ship).  The first night we stayed in a room with a set of bunk beds.  You could almost literally touch the two side walls when you stretched your arms out.  If you have a lot of luggage (or just big luggage) this room is going to be really tight. It was nice that each bunk bed had its own TV (if you plan to spend anytime in the room to watch it).    The rest of our stay we upgraded to a room that had two twin beds and a cute little table and chairs.  I would definitely pay to upgrade to this room going forward.....the extra space is worth the extra cost.   You do share a bathroom (but there are a few rooms;4
Really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were small but clean. But bedding nice and good pillows made up for that. Bathroom small but good enough for the time you spend in there. Downside there is no consiege which I thought was strange for such a big hotel. Reception staff quite helpful though.  Would definitely stay here again because of the location. Penn station just over the road. Not far from Time Square, Empire State and Macy's.  All in all a good stay.;4
Location is very good, close to subway. Staff does what they can to help you with what you need. I arrived late night and Chris had a smile on his face and an outstanding good mood. Breakfast is in the rooftop and the view is amazing.;4
Fantastic location right next to Central Park & Metro lines A & 1. Rooftop bar is very good, the pool is small but served a purpose. Rooms are a decent size, well stocked mini bar but very pricey, better to pop to local store. Good turndown service and Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay again. Some great bars nearby including Lincoln Bar on 57th, Bar Nine on 54th for live music and Valhalla for good selection of craft beer.;4
The Empire Hotel has the perfect West Side location. Visiting friends on the upper West Side AND in the Village? Attending events at Lincoln Center AND going to a Broadway play? You can to everything very easily from The Empire. And as an actual place to stay, there's a lot to like even if the hotel doesn't quite earn your love. On the positive side, besides location, the staff is friendly and helpful, the rates are fine, our bed was extremely comfortable, and the bath amenities are from C.O. Bigelow. Imperfections: The lighting in our junior suite was too dim to read anywhere but in bed. There was no light source at all by the desk. The armoire was too narrow for hanging both our regular clothes and our winter coats. The drawer space is almost comically small for more than an;4
This is a wonderful hotel!! The rooms are very big with a mini fridge! Great food, outdoor pool, and location is great. Short walk to  universal citywalk and studios. The little cafe is also very good!! The only thing bad is that our room flooded. The toilet was not working properly and water just keeped coming out. Called the front desk about 10 times and they did not seem to understand what was going on. After about a half hour they came. The water was  all the way to the beds. They moved us to the room under the room that flooded and it was leaking. So we moved across the hall. Other then our room flooding I would go back and recommened!!!;4
This hotel is kept very clean and is really friendly. Helpful staff, great location, incredibly comfortable bed, I had no problem sleeping. Location is great, wi-fi worked well. This was my second stay at the ameritania and it's been great both times.;4
"Glad I made this my first ever hotel in the United States. Friendly staff upon check in. Room nice and clean with nice shared balcony overlooking courtyard. Room is for the most part quiet and the guests that stay here are mostly middle class tourists so no problems with excessive noise and riff-raff. Breakfast is above average with a choice of omelette, pancakes, cereal, juice and coffee. Which is included in your fee. Room made up everyday without fail although I slept in very late! Will be back. Sidenote; station is full of homeless and beggars but that occurs in most tourist areas in the US. Probably best not to use buses and trains with the kids. Pot smell everytime I walked the streets.";4
Geoff or Jeff the doorman (not sure how he spells it) the concierge was a pleasure and so helpful. Always will help with any questions or any job you want. Elizabeth kept the room clean and tidy and was a pleasure also. Location was perfect. 3 streets from Central Park and only a few 2 minutes away from Times Square and all the subway lines.   The downside was the Bar was closed when we looked for it. I did hear The server say she was dead all night and would probably close up early so maybe this is what happened the previous nights. A little training might have been needed for her also. It's right beside a bar the three monkeys which is fab so not to bad. Would stay here again though as its a lovely hotel with helpful and friendly staff;4
Lovely dramatic lobby/entrance that blasts you with hot air on arrival. Great location near Lincoln Center. Very friendly staff. We appreciated that the hotel allows pets, although we rhad to run out to buy litter and box immediately. Empire doesn't have room service, which we missed, and the mini bar peanuts were rancid though sealed. Keurig tea bags were not replaced after the first day, but bottled water was provided for the machine. Called several times about non-powered/non-functioning room safe, but despite multiple calls to front desk, and a visit from security who contacted engineering and promised they would be up soon... it was never fixed. Ended up carting heavy bag with laptop all over the city, to my chagrin. Room heater smelled musty. Nice room otherwise, though it;4
The room, lets start there. It was in need of an upgrade.- bad part. The hotel for the price in New York is not bad.  The bathroom- Clean and very nice. The towels were clean. The water, shower was not bad.  The sheets were not dirty. The pillows, loved them. The closet, sufficient amount of hangers. The vending machine on the 7th floor DID NOT TAKE THE MONEY WITHOUGH GIVING ME THE PRODUCT...can somebody tell the front desk personnel that...thank you. The vending machine did work well on 7.  The AC unit, not bad.  The area, quiet. The elevators, it was styled well.  The front desk person, professional. Who I thought was the Fire Safety Director, not bad when asked a question.  I in time when I am in New York will book this hotel again. My suggestion, get on the Wyndham rewards;4
I am a repeat guest and I feel like the staff at the Empire really pays attention to your needs despite what must be a pretty heavy rotation of guests. all my requests were promptly taken care of. The rooms are comfortable. There is coffee in the room, something that isn't standard in NYC hotel rooms. There is a charge, but it is only $3 which is less than if you go to Starbucks. I love the toiletries. I love the location across from Lincoln Center, having room service, etc. Bell men are very attentive. Ask for an outside room. The inside rooms are very dark. the outside rooms, which I have had on my last two visits, have great views of Lincoln Center from many of them.;4
They Hyatt is a modern hotel as close as you can get to LAX. The rooms and lobby are great. And there is ample self parking behind the hotel for a reasonable price. The reason for knocking it down a star was because a cleaning person came in to clean the room at 4:30 am!?!  This has never happened to me in over 40 years of traveling. When I called the front desk they said they would look into it but never called back.....;4
I stayed at the Empire for around ten days recently. The location is fantastic literally across the street from Lincoln Center. The staff starting with the bellman, the concierge, the front desk, to the housekeeping were all very friendly and willing to offer their services which is not very common in NYC. Overall my stay was very pleasant and will definitely return to the Empire whenever am in New York again if the rates are not too high.;4
"I have such a mixed feelings on this property so here is my disclaimer I am fighting one bad incident s all the great things. So let me start with the bad:  Check in took me over an hour. the process was this......I arrived at the hotel to two huge lines. So we waited in one line for around 35 min to finally check in the lady at the front counter could not be rudder complaining to her colleagues about how she hated this job and her bad day. She then got aggravated with any questions I asked her. I was even told ""sir thats not my problem you should know better than to show up at a hotel before check in time"" My question was do I now need to wait in the other long line to check my bag as the rooms are not ready or do you have a bellhop who takes bags of new incoming guests. Which";4
I am humble so i will say it is above average,staff were very helpful and had a good 3 days corner king room next to the gym would go there again not every1 is happy as i have read on trip advisor but every1 has good days and bad days but as i said would recommend to couples and families;4
If youâre looking for a clean, convenient and economical hotel, you may want to check this one out. By no means is it fancy, but it is located just a few blocks from the C train that takes you downtown to where lots of action takes place.  I didnât get to explore Central Park (literally across the street) or the surrounding neighborhood too much.  However, I felt safe walking to/from the subway at night. It is located in a quiet Upper West Side neighborhood â within walking distance to Harlem. It is not near Times Square, the Theater District or any of the more popular tourist attractions.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. I went with a friend for the long July 4th weekend and they told us exactly where to go for the best view of the fireworks and suggested a great;4
The Empire is wonderfully situated across from Lincoln Center. The hotel's location is matched by the attentiveness of the staff--especially Pasquale at the front desk.  The corner suite we occupied had wonderful panoramic view of Broadway. All in all, the Empire Hotel offers reasonably priced accommodations that rival much more expensive alternatives. The street noise was a bit loud, but that was only a minor inconvenience.;4
"We had to spend the night at LAX to catch an early morning flight to Kona. We picked the Hyatt because it was the closest to LAX and we've had pretty good luck with Hyatt. The hotel has been recently remodeled, and, I must admit, the ""modern"" decor was a bit sterile. But it was new, clean, and our room was a good size and nicely laid out. The Bathroom was one of the nicest I've had in recent memory.   But the highlight of our stay was the Regency Club. They had good food, good drinks, but the best part of our visit was Cairo, the concierge in the Regency Club. Attentive without hovering, but always there when you needed something (how he does that, I don't know!). Excellent service, very helpful, and very friendly. He made our stay all the more enjoyable.  The next time we have";4
Great hotel,front desk staff very friendly upgraded my room for FREE!! very close to shops and restaurants,in walking distance of Times Square and other major New York attractions,was also very clean and affordable.  CONS: wifi connection was hit or miss and VERY SMALL AND SLOW elevators;4
"Iam from Brisbane Australia. This is my opinion of Hollywood Hotel. Clean and Fresh. Rooms cleaned daily. Good shower we all know how we love a good shower.  Clean fresh linen and towels. Breakfast is not 5 star but its ok. The toaster is a nightmare takes so long to toast.  The location is good 10 / 15 mins from most attractions. Train Station across the road $1.75 to Walk of Fame about 3 or 4 stops and it drops you off in the middle of Walk of Fame strip  Nokia Centre; Universal Studio, Griffith Observatory 10/15 Mins drive.  We used Uber ( taxi service) you got to download the app. They are very very efficient. U blink and they there to pick u up. The shuttle from the Hotel cost $79 per person to Disneyland we paid  $25 with Uber on a SUNDAY morning. LA traffic is crazy.  The";4
We were pleased when we managed to get a great deal on a trip to New York through Expedia. Excellent price, direct flights and what looked like good apartment accommodation.   After reading all the reviews on Woogo Central Park - Tempo Apartments, I began to get really worried. Dirty apartments, cockroaches, rude staff.....what were we letting ourselves in for? We decided we would grin and bear it, we were not planning on spending much time in our rooms and surely it couldn't be that bad?  We were right to do so.... the apartment was brilliant.  I think it is important to mention that this is an apartment, not a hotel. You are renting a room for your stay and the guys at Woogo do not have to provide you with towels, toiletries and other extras you would expect to find in a;4
I have just spent 4 nights at the Days Inn Broadway. I didn't get an upgraded room, so the carpet was stained, the room smelly, etc... But the bed sheets were clean, and the room bigger than I expected. Service is poor and staff fast and direct, but this hotel is cheap, with the subway at its feet, and exactly what you get for the money you are willing to spend. Would stay here again.;4
After reading reviews I was a little concerned...but I found that only one staff member was not approachable...(morning-day girl) but the other female and 2 males I dealt with were very friendly and helpful. I found our room was a good size and had a real nice bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and room was very clean. Breakfast was good also.;4
The surroundings of the hotel were beautiful with lush gardens and hilltops with views of Universal Studios.  Rooms were modern although the bathrooms could be cleaner.  Small spots of mold on the tile. Our room had an adjoining door to another room which is not sound proof.  The hotel staff quickly handled the noisy guests.  I overlooked the shenanigans going on in the hallway since the noise was short lived.  Although the path to Universal Studios is short, itâs not exactly safe to walk with young children.  Thereâs a shuttle every 15 minutes, but if itâs full one has to wait for the next one. City Walk is close with lots of restaurants to choose from.  Wished the coffee booth was open in the afternoon and evening.  Lobby and pool area are small given the grandeur appearance;4
We stayed here for 10 days, and were very pleased with standard of room, and breakfast provided was good.  Staff at the omelette counter were especially nice and cheerful, and made it pleasant to go to breakfast everyday. The room was clean and tidy, only down side was being on the first floor meant it did get noisy during the evening and early morning when people were returning or going out past our room which was right by the rear exit. The location of the Hotel is excellent, close by the Metro which was a cheap way to get around the city.  Unlike previous reviews we found the location fine and did not experience any problems.  Would recommend this hotel.;4
This is a good business hotel which has the convenience of being adjacent to the airport.   Rooms are nice and spacious, toilet and toiletries are nice. The bed is nice and comfortable.    The cafe in the lobby is extremely efficient and utilitarian.    The hotel offers free shuttle from LAX every 10 mins and it just takes 10 mins to the hotel so the convenience of location certainly works in its favour.    I travelled to Manhattan Beach for work so cannot comment on how convenient it would be for people needing to go to Downtown.  All in all a good good business hotel near the airport;4
I want to mention that I worked with Pasquale at the front desk and received particularly helpful service! I had a complicated booking which involved several changes over the course of a week.  The front desk staff were excellent, kind, friendly and caring saw to it that my stay was convenient and pleasant. I received a fine room and was able to stay in the same room when I made the changes.;4
Hotel room was comfortable  (especially the bed). I did not pay for the wifi. Staff seem to be very nice addition accommodating. Great location..close to Broadway shows, Times Square, and Central Park!;4
This hotel was very nice. The decor is very good, the roof top bar is good at night pritty expensive but its new york city and your in a roof top bar so you dont expect it to be cheap. Very clean hotel, beds changed every day, the cleaner even folding up all my clothes i left out.. All the staff are very friendly. The bed is possible the best hotel bed i've slept in. Its in a very good location, metro stop 5 minutes walk away. If you Going to new york i'd stay here.;4
We stayed here for 3 days in early September (me, husband, and 4-month old baby).  Overall we had a pleasant stay.  We had a King alcove room with a view overlooking 101 (and Vivid Entertainment...lol).  The room was great and there was plenty of room for the luggage, crib, large stroller.  Great size bathroom with a separate vanity.  My husband raved about the water pressure in the shower - they gained high points from my husband on this!  My only real complaints... because the size of the room we got and the shape of it, the TV seemed a little far away.  They either need to move it closer or get bigger TVs for this room.  Additionally, the food at the hotel was ok. We ended up getting room service one night because we ran out of time and our baby was ready for bed.  The food;4
The hotel was really nice and the staff were excellent and helpful.  The room I had looked a bit small as well as a  small bathroom counter.  I booked this through Universal Studios and got a great deal, but I think there are probably much better and larger rooms.  So I think I got what I paid for.  I did have concern about the area.  It was a bit sketchy. There was a homeless encampment right around the corner, and I would probably not leave the premises at night with my daughters unless I had a car.  I never felt unsafe at the hotel though.  My guess is that when it was established in 1908 the area was not that bad.  It just got that way over time.  The Complimentary breakfast was excellent.  There was so much to choose from that no matter who you traveled with, there was;4
Excellent. Phenomenal service, great overall experience. Large rooms with comfortable bed/bedding. Clean. Staff was consistent and always eager to assist with directions, places to visit, travel options & wonderful stay. I extended my stay another night. Will be returning as repeat customer for business and family travel. Thank you.;4
I recently stayed at The Jane for the first time in a single room with a shared bath.  A few things I wish I had known:    Pluses: â¢	Great location.  Friendly staff. â¢	I stayed on the top floor, far from the elevator.  Rooms were quietâ¦never heard my neighbors. â¢	Nice lunch at CafÃ© Gitane, the onsite restaurant. â¢	Bathrobe and free carafe of water in the room were nice touches. â¢	Shared bathroom/shower room was very clean.  No problem getting hot water for showers.  Shower contains dispensers for shampoo, conditioner, soap.  The shower is a single, lockable space.  Thereâs a door hook within the shower stall.  If you are careful, your things will not get wet.  Hair dryers in bathrooms.  Never had to wait or go to another floor.   Useful to know: â¢	Room was clean, but not super;4
Modern decor, but just needs a little more care in the decor.  The lobby is great for meeting people, but just needs a spruce up.   Bar is good too, and its location is great for Lincoln Center, Time Warner Center, Columbus Circle, easy walk to most places and subways.   One thing, do not touch the snacks in the rooms, they are horrendously expensive!   The Keurig coffee is $3.50 a cup (incidentally, a paper cup). Some of the rooms are very small, but adequate and the location makes up for it.;4
Very nice, upscale Hilton with many ammenities.  It is the closest hotel to Universal Studios Hollywood.  The hotel offers a free shuttle to the park, however, my 12 yr old and I walked in less than 10 minutes and made use of a pedestrian bridge to avoid crossing streets with heavy traffic patterns.      We enjoyed a great panoramic view from an upper floor room.;4
Just back from a four day stay. Really liked this hotel. Location is fab five min walk from Macy's. Beside madison sq garden. The rooms are on the small side but we were put on the 36th floor and it was perfect. Fab views. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The tic toc diner is gorgeous to have breakfast in.;4
The Jane is a comfortable , clean and in a great neighborhood kind of hotel.   I mean your room is actually about the size of most Americans closets, but it has a good bed, clean linens, a robe and slippers for going down the hall to use the bathroom and a TV.  So for a 100 bucks in NYC, you can't really go wrong.  Sure you might see some hot Sweedish girls or an old geezer brushing their teeth when you use the shared bath, but its part of the experience.   There was some weird guy who looked as if he lived there for the last 10 years or so on the 5th floor, but MGMt was talking about trying to get him out of the property, cuz he was weird and left his door cracked the whole time I was there.  The cafe downstairs has great food and banging coffee. The downstairs bar is;4
Recomend the Jr. Suite.  Great location.  Glad that I chose the Empire.  The front desk staff was fantastic.  I did not dine in or attend the hotel lobby bar.  The rooms could use brighter light.  I was there for Business.;4
If you are going to Universal Studios I would highly recommend this hotel.  You can't get any closer.  The rooms were very nice and ours looked recently renovated.  We had 2 adjoining rooms on a high floor and it worked out great.  Views of were also great.  You won't be disappointed staying here.;4
The newly renovated hotel lobby and rooms are great with a gym facility on the top floor and panoramic views to the airport. Friendly staffs and frequent shuttle to the airport but the restaurant food is not so tasty and should be improved for a 4-star hotel.;4
This hotel is perfectly placed to see everything you NYC.  We had 3 full days and managed to do everything we wanted to.  We booked into a metro double which had two bathrooms.  Lovely big room and comfy beds.  Downside was that it was dark - the windows looked into the building next door.  The next day I spoke to Linda on front desk (who was lovely and super helpful) and upgraded (at an extra cost, although she got me a good rate) to an executive double with a view on the 30th floor.  Great view and really nice, newly renovated room.  I would definitely recommend upgrading to a view.  Advantage with the exec room was that we got a coffee machine.  Definite bonus as they don't come as standard.  All of the staff were super friendly.  And a big shout out to John who organised our;4
I had a nice stay and will definitely go back.  A little TLC is needed though.  Overall a good experience.  My room was perfect size for just me and the bed was very comfortable.  Bathrooms are very small for clean.;4
I was looking for a place close to the train station to avoid finding a taxi at rush hour. This is the place! There are over 1000 rooms in many combinations. I booked a suite so the teenagers could have their own room. The couch was surprisingly good to sleep on! Many elevators so we never had to wait. The front desk was friendly and efficient. The views from our 26th floor room were an added bonus! as was the balcony! There is the Tic Tock dinner in the hotel and we ate their for our breakfast each day. Would stay again.;4
I've stayed at The Jane twice and have never regretted my decision. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The in house restaurant and bar are great. Rooms are super small, but completely serve their purpose. Shared bathrooms are clean and have a sleek look. If all you want is a place to sleep in a great neighborhood, this is place for you. No luxuries, but comfortable. Excellent dining options close by.;4
It is an awesome place to stay near LAX with good shuttle service , I had booked the hotel through Price line and requested King room but that was not available at check in , i was disappointed at this and also had problems with logging in to wifi ,other than these minor hiccups it,s a pretty good place to relax after a long flight;4
I enjoyed this hotel. We had bunk beds. It was clean and friendly and the AC worked.  We shared a bathroom at the end of the hall. For $125 per room it was well worth it.    We were here for a party, came in late and left early  The only issue for a non smoking hotel is that they have tenants who are grandfathered and can't be forced to not smoke or leave.  While I did not smell anything in the room the hallway was ripe.  I think it is only the third floor.  Parking is immediately across the street in a garage that isn't connected with the hotel.     I would stay again.;4
This is my 4th stay at the Empire Hotel and it I like to stay there for the location which is convenient to shopping and shows.  The rooms are rather small (we had a Deluxe Room with 2 Queen Beds).  The bathroom is tiny but worked for the 2 of us.  What I found to be a issue was there was no furniture with drawers to unpack miscellaneous items into.  They provided 4 hangers in the closet but with two of us staying 6 nights I requested 10 more hangars and they came very quickly.  The beds are nice and the room is clean.  I will definitely stay again.  Our only problem was the refrig in the room didn't work.;4
the location and staff were excellent only complain no breakfast included, room prices are very expensive they should include at least continental breakfast, for free. the buffet prices are outrageous, and food mediocre,(especially when you are in a family budget) also do no pay for valet you can do it yourself and save tons of money (anyway they park cars on same place);4
I've just returned from a 4 night stay here - the hotel was great and just what we needed. I'll list the things that I was focusing on when choosing a hotel:  Room size was good, plenty of room for two of us to spread out with the contents of our suitcases etc and still be able to make use of the rest of the room. The bathroom was a good size and the shower is great.  Room was clean and nicely decorated, as was the rest of the hotel especially the lobby.  Street noise - I requested a room higher up at the time of booking to avoid this and they put us right on the top floor (12), no problems with noise at all. Even if we were lower down I don't think it would have been an issue.  Lifts - there are 3 lifts and we didn't have to wait around for them what so ever, this seems to be a;4
We booked this hotel through Virgin holidays, who we also booked our trip to New York through. We had never been to New York or America before so were unsure what to expect on both accounts. When we arrived at the hotel, there was a door person to assist with our luggage straight away who took us straight to reception. We were greated warmly at reception and given complementary bottles of water. The room we stayed in had two double beds and a bathroom with a toilet, basin and shower. Although the decor is slightly dated, we could not fault the hotel on cleanliness. The room was cleaned every day, with towels changed every day and the sheets were changed at least once during our stay. The hotel also had a turn down service which was a bonus. As for location, you cannot fault the;4
The hotel was nice, rooms are big and beds are comfortable. There was a wide choice for breakfast. The staff was very kind at all time, especially Nicole and Beatriz, who helped me a lot and we had a fun conversation. Greetings from Rome;4
I really enjoyed staying here. The charm of this place made me think of the roaring twenties. Friendly staff, great bartender. And the location is perfect. I'm an opera buff. 4 performances in a row at the Met. Splendid Rosenkavalier! And 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Lincoln Centre, Juilliard School, Central Park â all close by.;4
So our stay was good. While I get that it is an old hotel. It does need some updating. The bathroom was an icebox the draft from all windows was terrible. We had to have the heat on full. But the staff was friendly and approachable. The cleaning staff do an amazing job, we were happy to leave daily tip. The ice machine on our floor never worked. Also it would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room. The bath faucet spewed out brown water until I let it run. All in all Iâd give it 9/10. For convenience to surrounding area.;4
After extending our trip to San Francisco by another day with no problem in changing our reservations, we arrived a little ahead of schedule and were accommodated with a room right away. We used the valet parking which was not that much more than the self park and was much cheaper than the San Francisco Hilton valet. The staff were all very professional and seemed very genuine. We received a great offer through the concierge for entrance to Universal Studios for two days for $80/ person which was a great savings and very convenient as it was across the street from the hotel and proved to be a very nice view. Our room was a large corner suite that we added a cot for our teenage daughter. We went out for a while that evening and came back to a welcoming fruit tray with trail mix;4
The hotel is about a 10  min walk to Universal Studios - you have to go down the road, cross the street  and take the bridge. Or you can take the shuttle which stops first at the Sheraton.  It will drop you off at Universal CityWalk. There is a post by the pick-up area that indicates waiting time which is usually about 10 mins..  The staff was friendly and courteous. My husband had a problem with wi-fi and the TV remote was low on battery but someone was up there in no time to fix the problems. The room was spacious with wonderful views of the hillside and the pool. The bed was very comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. The bathroom was huge and I love that they provide many towels. Our room was at the corner with only the fire exit across so it was quiet. The hotel could;4
Overall, it was a great base for exploring London. The room was clean, and breakfast was fantastic value. At check-in, I was using the automated system and following the instructions when a staff member snatched the room card out my hand and continued to finish off the process, I didn't ask for help nor did I need it. The room was also I bit chilly. We'd been out at Christmas markets all day and were cold to start off with and just couldn't make the room warm up.;4
Good location. Nice, friendly staff. Room was a decent size really comfoetable beds, bathroom was a bit dated and shower not the best but okay. Excellent location and a reasonable price. Would stay again;4
The staff greeted me as if we were family the entire time we were there. The staff was always kind and respectful. Upon returning to my room I found that the housekeeper Eloise I believe her name is, found a vase to put my birthday flowers. We enjoyed our entire stay.  Next  time we stay we hope to use the exercise equipment. The location was great, we walked to the movie theater, rode the subway which was minutes away from our hotel. A variety of good restaurants and Starbucks on almost every corner. The only downfall was that the shuttle ( we thought would be faster than a cab)  left the  hotel at 1:50 pm arrived at the airport at 3:45pm. We still made our flight but if we had known we would have just caught a cab.;4
We stayed at the Hilton Universal City for two nights in a standard room.  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by all staff members and check in was friendly and efficient.  The room was spacious and of good quality.  The TV worked well and the bathroom was large.  The bed was very comfortable.  The hotel continues to have issues with the elevators which seem to have dragged on for over 12 months now but the staff do there best during peak times to assist.  In my experience we only had one occasion where we decided to take the stairs, all other times we didn't have to wait too long.  The staff at this hotel were amongst the best we have experienced on our three week trip.  The only negative about this hotel was no free wi-fi.  This is rare considering everywhere else provides;4
It  was a very fine room on 10th floor, excellent and helpful service. The hotel isvery close to metro and times square, My only issue was that aircondition was rather noisy when you were going to sleep;4
I stayed at the Broadway Days Inn for two nights, checking out on New Years Eve. I was traveling alone for my first trip to New York and safety was my main priority. The hotel is in a very safe part of the city and I never felt threatened, even when arriving back to the hotel late at night. When I arrived at the hotel they told me I was booked in a room with two double beds and I requested a room with just one bed instead as that was all I needed. The receptionist was very accommodating and reassigned me to a great corner room with a king sized bed and all the amenities listed. The hotel is very old and worn, if you are looking for a hotel that is more more polished and modern you may want to consider paying more downtown. The location is great, it is out of the hustle and;4
Always use Premier. Stayed here before. This time couldn't  get through in advance. Tried for two days. Wanted to check an hour early or drop off cases. Had to take them to first appointment. No hot water on the night we stayed or in the morning. Very hot day. Slightly spoiled the trip.;4
The hotel is located next to Lincoln Center and close to Central Park. Like most hotels in NYC, it's pricey, but it's clean and comfortable and has a nice ambience. Two seafood restaurants are attached - we had a delicious lunch at Ed's Chowder House. The rooftop bar is all the rage, but we were there on a cold day and didn't venture up. All in all, a good hotel choice.;4
Very nice hotel. Absolutly loved the courtyard view! Gorgeous! Excellent Front Desk Staff as well. Besides the location of the hotel, we had a wonderful time here and enjoyed every minute of it.;4
I have just returned from a  fanatastic 4 night stay in the astor hotel with my friend for a girlie weekend.  Rooms were a good size,we had room 101, with everything you need eg a comfortable bed and good shower.There was a complimentary coffee machine and internet access which we found useful for booking our empire state building tickets.  Reception staff helpful and so were the door men. The hotel is about 4 blocks from Broadway overlooking central park so about a 10 minute walk from restaurants, bars and shops.Mama mexican can be highly recommended as amazing food.The Tavern bar  was really nice and full of lovely people and cheap!!  broadway bagels for breakfasts again excellent!  Would definatly stay at this hotel again!;4
"In summary: A great place to stay for a city break; fun, friendly, quirky and good value.  More details: We stayed at The Jane for three nights last June at the beginning of a road trip down the east coast. We booked a Captain's Cabin to have a private bathroom and a little more space and we loved our room. Awesome decor, lovely old-fashioned (looking!) bathroom and lots of space for luggage. The bed was comfortable and we appreciated the free wifi and free bottled water. The only things I would have changed were that our room wasn't ready on arrival as arranged, and I had requested a river view and we had a view of the carpark instead, but this didn't affect our stay at all. With only a few days to explore NYC we wanted a good location and weren't disappointed. We ate at";4
I was am very impressed with this hotel. My girlfriend and I are in LA for a little mini vacay. There is a huge video game convention going on in town so finding a room in the city at a reasonable rate was difficult. Because we had plans to visit Universal Studios we were looking for something in the northern Hollywood area and this place was only a few exits down the freeway. Was really not expecting much but this place has a really great homey vibe. Try to get a room facing the courtyard if you can. For the price and location (If you plan to do a lot of sightseeing in Hollywood) I can't recommend this place enough. I have already told my girlfriend the next time we come to Hollywood we are staying here.  I was a little apprehensive when we were first driving here because you;4
The New Yorker is a huge hotel of 1050 rooms which had me scared when I entered the huge and busy lobby. No need to have been scared as all the staff were helpful, concerned and very pleasant. Whilst our room was small it was spotlessly clean. The shower had great pressure, which was definitely lacking in the previous hotel we were in! We would be happy to stay at The New Yorker again.;4
We stayed at the Empire Hotel for 4 nights over Christmas 2016.  The hotel was very well located and directly across the street from the Lincoln Performing Arts Center.  Many very good restaurants nearby and Central Park within easy walking distance.  The hotel itself is average.   As we were leaving, we talked with Tommy, the friendly doorman at the main hotel entrance.  He's an ex-NYC policeman that took disability leave because he was shot in his left knee during a bank robbery (ask him what happened to the bank robber).  We needed to take a taxi to JFK right then and it was rush hour in holiday season.  No taxis.  Tommy walks out into traffic on Broadway in the rain for a couple of minutes and finds us a hard-to-find cab.  We had no cash to tip him - he just smiles and says;4
This was our 1st stay at the days hotel, as we arrived early the rooms are not ready untill  3pm, we were able to leave our bags with Ronald the concierge, who was a gem. We came back from central park(2 blocks away), The hotel had upgraded our room at no extra cost (we didnt ask).The room was brilliant, yes they are renovating the rooms,we had one that had been finnished to a high standard, tea and coffe maker, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, flat screen TV, alarm clock radio with docking station,air con(a must)  plenty of electric sockets more than most hotels. The bathroom was clean with a good shower, there was a full selection of travel size toiletries toothbrush and razor. The staff were very helpfull and friendly, they also have a desk at the hotel were you can book;4
I booked  this hotel for 5 nights On our  arrival the room was not ready yet but the guy at reception desk Mohammed finally granted us to another room We were upgraded to an upper room on 36th floor with a great view on the empire state buildin ,thanks a lot. The new Yorker hotel is very well located in midtown perfect to visit the town.;4
My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in a King Executive room on the 21st floor.  We LOVED it!   The room was very spacious, had a table and two chairs and a sofa with coffee table.   The King bed was very comfortable with soft bedding and lots of pillows.   The only cons about the room is that the TV is old and not a very good picture and there is no in-room refrigerator.   There is a cabinet for the coffee maker and we thought that was the fridge, but nope, seems like they can turn those into mini-fridges.   We did have a safe in the room and one robe was provided in the closet.   We also had a park view room and we loved looking out over Universal and the surrounding area.   Overall, it was a very nice room!  We opted for the breakfast package and received 4 breakfast;4
Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were nice and clean. And it's just a 2 minute walk from the metro. The continental breakfast was the best one I've ever had. Eggs made to order, fresh fruit, pastries, and a wide variety of cereals. If I was visiting LA again I'd definitely stay there.;4
This would have to be one of the more unusual hotels I have stayed at. The rooms were the size of my wardrobe, the decor and styling was antique and the staff dressed as though they were from a different era. All this made for a perfect stay! The rooms, while small, were very efficient in their use of space and had all the amenities you needed. The bathrooms and linen were kept very clean, and never did I have to wait for a toilet or shower. The decor of the hotel was fantastic! And the location was fabulous, close to shops and the subway! I just fell in love with the surrounding neighbourhood! Only downside was the noise of the air conditioner, but after one night, I got used to it. Would definitely stay again not only for the price, but for the experience.;4
"We stayed for 4 nights at the Hollywood Hotel and were very happy with our stay. The room was big clean and looked out onto the courtyard. The shower was a tad weak for our preference but was warm.  The breakfast was definitely one of the best we had during our trip around California. The staff were exceptionally friendly and were always keen to make us blueberry teddy bear shaped waffles. The omelettes were also very tasty! The location was ok, but I struggle to think where in LA is a ""good location"" since everything is so far spread out! We had a car and very grateful for it! It is only $15 taxi ride to Hollywood Boulevard which was good for a night out. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and would happily come back.";4
I came for two nites on a working holiday.  Very nice hotel and bar. Room very spacious and alot of  channels on t.v as you would expect.  Breakfast ok and coffee was really good  Would stay here again on my next visit.;4
A very enjoyable hotel with priceless location for when travelling as a family to New York and interesting history. A point worth noting is the staff and service in this hotel, and more specifically, Mohammed who stood in the reception the night we wanted to check-in and improved our stay. Our room having a view of the Empire State, Madison Square Garden, and Chrysler Building also gave us an incredible view over three of the iconic buildings of Manhattan.;4
The atmosphere is really quite good with a nice open lobby and the staff are quite friendly and they have a good menu the only bad thing is the price for parking inside the hotel, this could be a bit cheaper though.;4
spent a week here. there were a few teething problems but nothing Luis couldn't fix.  location and price cant be beat. great views and a great rooftop bar. would stay here again. 24hr star bucks and chemist underneath. great food nearby.  1 block to central park.;4
Vary nice hotel. staff was attentive and saved me money by recommending and arranging the valet parking. very pleased with how quite it was given the location so close to LAX. I would definitely stay here again.;4
Hi,  I really recomend this nice LARA GROUP apartment in New York City. It has very good location in city centre - 5 minutes by walk from Central Park, 50m from Subway station.  Our apartment has been very clean and comfortable for 3 person. (see attached pictures)  You have to pay full payment in advance but donÂ´t worry, there wasnÂ´t no problem.  Beata Kujanova;4
Built in 1929, this great hotel is a grand feature to behold.  We arrived early and after an hour wait, the front desk clerk obtained a room for us to check in.  If we elect to leave our bags at the bell hop, we would have to had paid $3 per bag.  Our room, room 2807 was extremely small as I am sure most room are.  I think in the Wyndham's remodel stage, they should have knocked a few walls down and join them to make suites if they had not dome that.  The cleaning staff were very pleasant and eager to assist for whatever needs you may have.  The lobby seemed to be very busy all through the day and night.  The lobby security worked diligently as to not allow unregistered guests to have access to the elevators and that is appreciated.  I liked this hotel a lot and look forward to;4
Such a great location and bargain,  needs some attention..A window in my room by the bed leaked and it was cold, cold, cold....I asked for an extra blanket....never came. The heat wasnât on either. The doormen were just lovely...thoughtful and helpful.;4
We had a great experience here! Iï¸ booked a 2 double room through Groupon at an incredible rate. The room was dated and we didnât have a view but I knew that going in and the location was great! We had plenty of room for the 4 of us with 2 bathrooms and 2 closets. The beds were small but comfortable. This was the most affordable way to stay near midtown/Times Square.;4
It was a good stay! Nothing else to say. Only way to be better is to have lower rates. I did not partake in the breakfast.;4
This hotel is perfectly located to everything. We arrived to a welcoming, clean, air conditioned room. Would have given a higher rating but was disappointed on our last day after a long day out we wanted to rest up before heading out again. It was 4 pm and our room hadnât been serviced yet. We had to sit in the lobby and try to stay awake. That was a bit disappointing. I wouldnât recommend eating breakfast here either..costly and below average food. Make sure you say hi to Jeff at the door. He would have to be the nicest man in New York!! Jeff is full of local knowledge and more than happy to help you out. What an asset he is to this hotel.;4
amazing staff, clean rooms, perfect for a week's stay. would highly reccomend this to anyone I know! breakfast is amazing, a lot of choices and it has a subway station right on the corner of it. staff is Always polite and awesome!;4
I stayed at Ameritania recently when I was in town for work to attend a convention for my industry. It's really convenient how close to Javitz this place is. The room was clean and the hotel had a nice lobby, which are two important things to me in a hotel. I heard other guests complaining about the room size, but come on, it's NYC, seriously? I was fine with the room size. I didn't spend a ton of time in the room anyway. I'm a NY ex-pat living down South and it had been awhile since I've been to NYC so during my down time I wanted to see as much of the city as I could. I was a little rusty on navigating the subway, so Alaa at the front desk was very helpful in giving me tips on how to get around from the hotel to where I wanted to go. Everyone on the staff I spoke with were;4
Great location only 10min from Time Square staff very friendly specially Jeff at the door he could do enough to help us he has made our stay so much more enjoyable . I would recommend this hotel highly;4
From my first interaction with the Jane 6 months before my trip I was very impressed. The staff were happy for me to have a parcel delivered to the front desk and when I arrived I felt welcome especially as a solo female traveller in a new country! I loved the bell-hop uniform of the staff and the old-fashioned style of the walkways and lift. (I didn't love the fact there was only one lift but it's an old building!) The rooms are small, yes, but you cannot claim to be surprised by this as it's made blatantly clear on the website. They were impeccably clean and the hotel provide bottles of water (one in the room on arrival and more when requested), dressing gowns and slippers, which I wasn't expecting. I didn't have air con, but I hate air con anyway, and was relieved that I had;4
We stayed here on a recent trip to LA.  We found the hotel to be great - our first experience was the reception staff, who were consistently brilliant throughout our stay.  They were courteous, friendly and approachable - nothing at all was too much trouble.  As first time LA visitors, they really helped us orientate to the city and shared some top tips!   The room was clean, comfortable and spacious.  It seemed a little 'cold' when we walked in due to the laminate flooring, however we have absolutely no complaints... and who goes to LA to sit in their room anyway?!  We had a room that overlooked the courtyard - we didn't ever manage to visit it, but it looked lovely on an evening.  Breakfast was included, which consisted of a great variety of foods including the usual cereal,;4
The location is great, right next to Penn Station and near times square. Quick check in and the staff were very friendly. The Room was clean and welcoming. We had a great view of the skyline which for me is what you look for in a New York hotel. The bathroom was a little bit rough around the edges but overall fine. The hotel has a lot of history and is an iconic place to stay with its art deco theme. The price is reasonable for the central location. Cheaper places could be found out of downtown or with a budget hotel.;4
We stayed here in 2008 and were more than happy with our apartment, from what I gather standard of places to stay in New York aren't very high, maybe our expectations were quite low however we were more than happy with our apartment to be honest who spends a lot of time in their rooms when staying in New York. I would reccommend this place to friends & family!;4
this place is a hidden gem, far enough away from the hustle of Times Square but near enough to walk to.  The hotel styling is excellent, and the lobby is a lovely place in which to relax, especially the huge fire!  the staff were all extremely helpful, shout out to Julian and Jeff who were fantastic in seeing to our every need (the taxi they organised back to the airport was a god send!).  Also want to make a comment about the lovely receptionist who having remembered booking us in managed to reunite my son and his wallet from Joe's Pizza place!!  excellent service!.     the rooms are well designed, smart and bijoux with exceptionally comfortable beds.  great shower and all the amenities you would ever need whilst travelling - the umbrella was very useful!! i would not hesitate;4
Fantastic hotel. Clean and cozy. Staff was excellent. Location was phenomenal. Walking distance to central park. Directly across the street from Lincoln Center. Starbucks downstairs around the corner as well as a Duane Reade. Reasonable 24hr. Parking only one block away.;4
Location simply cannot be beat. Steps  ( literally) from Lincoln center. Uptown, downtown, crosstown busses and subway within a block. And 6 restaurants, grocery, takeout, Duane Reade and Starbucks all right there. Why am I telling you this? All the rooms will probably be booked for my next visit!;4
We booked a last minute trip to Hollywood in April 2011 to see a couple of our favourite bands who were playing that week. After looking at lots of hotels, we decided on The Hollywood Hotel due to the price being so good and it being fairly close by to where we needed/wanted to be.  After a long flight from the UK, we checked in with no problems, the staff were not super friendly but nice enough. The room was quite small, basic but efficient, it has a double bed, tv, bathroom, small balcony and everything was clean.  Breakfast was served every morning downstairs and it was a nice, quiet room with enough breakfast for everyone staying there.  The hotel is a typical 3 star - clean, good base.  There are two 'tube' stations nearby that will get you anywhere you need to go. We didnt;4
Had a fabulous stay at this hotel, staff were friendly and helpful. had  lovely room which overlooked the Hudson. Very central to everything with Macy's just a short walk away. Would definitely stay here again.;4
Nice art deco hotel, perfect location. We had a suite on the 39th floor. With breathtaking city views. Donât expect large rooms. Although the suites are big enough. Would stay there again! On walking distance of Central Park, Time Square and Macyâs. Madison Square Garden just across the street. Donât forget to check whoâs performing while youâre there. We saw The Eagles, and made great memories! Enjoy your stay!;4
The hotel is beside the Lincoln Centre and close to Central Park.  It is within walking distance of Times Square.  The standard rooms, all the same, are small and quite dark with no view.  We chose to upgrade at a cost $100 per night so that we could have a bigger room and a view of the Lincoln Centre, water fountain and trees.  The bed was very comfortable.  Large screen TV.   Wardrobe space very limited.  Shower was open - no door - so it was very easy to flood the bathroom!  The hotel has it own dry-cleaning service which we found very prompt and efficient.  Coffee stains on my husband's shirt and trousers were removed without trace.;4
"Nice hotel, good sized rooms, excellent location, hip and young, lobby feels like a night club; fun for gathering with friends, would definitely recommend, gym access could be better, restaurant downstairs was great for dinner and breakfast.";4
The hotel bar and lounge evoke exotic and intriguing places.  The quiet, dimly lit lounge has deep- cushioned couches and a welcoming fireplace.  The walls are mosaic. The ceiling is lofty. The glass chandeliers and lamps glitter and throw shadows on dark corners where the eyes of a stuffed peacock or ungulate peer back.  And after fine drinks and conversation, the Cafe Gitane French /Moroccan restaurant is adjacent, where a wonderful meal can be enjoyed at a very reasonable price.;4
"If you are going to the Met for an opera experience, then the Empire makes a great base. Staggering out of that heavenly plush auditorium after a wonderful performance (but 4 1/2 hours long)  of Handel's ""Giulio Cesare, once on the Lincoln Center Plaza, the friendly red illuminated neon sign ""EMPIRE"" means that you are only 5 minutes away from your bed - no hassle for taxis or other means of transport. Our twin queen bedded room was very comfortable. The shower room a bit tired but functional. The heating/cooling system a bit noisy - but it worked.  Reception is very efficient and helpful. Leaving late on a Monday we were allowed a 2pm checkout (rather than the usual 12.00 noon). The in-house Chowder House restaurant provided a good value fish dinner.  No tea or coffee options";4
Located across the street from Lincoln Center makes this a great spot to stay for an Opera/Concert weekend.  Hotel is very lovely and nicely renovated. Rooms as clean and quite comfortable.  Price is fair.;4
New York: Astor on the Park - Good Location, Good Room, Good Price! Date of Stay: 18-19 Dec 2008 Reviwer: Wandering wondererhk  Room was small but very clean. You will love the toilet and bath tub as it appears to be newly rennovated or well kept.  We were put in a room with a king-sized bed facing Central Park.  I would agree with the other reviews that there is not much room to put big bags but we just had backpacks so it was no problem for us.  Staff were very helpful in giving tips and directions on how to go around and where to get some eats.  Locationwise, it is just three blocks from the 103rd street subway station.  The M10 bus is also just on the next street.  I took the Airtrain-subway from the Airport and did ot find any trouble finding the place.  It is located in a;4
Initially our room was very tired and not to the cleanliness we expected however you moved us without question and that room was really good, thank you. The bathroom was very tired again but all clean and good. We had food a couple of times which was lovely and the front door staff were very friendly every day without question and when we asked questions they were very good. Overall we loved our stay, thank you to everyone.;4
Rooms were fine, close to the action, walking distance to everything. Shuttle avl if required late at night, felt safe walking back from the walk area. Clean areas and helpful staff. Breakfast a lillte expensive but not much around unless you want to eat over in the walk area.;4
I stayed here for a couple of nights in August. The rooms were clean and large and the hotel was perfect for my needs. Because the lifts are being upgraded there usually was a long wait and sometimes they arrived full.  However, the operator then brought it straight back to my floor.  All the staff were friendly and very helpful, especially the concierge, who went out of her way to advise my nephew when his luggage was damaged on our flight.  The shuttle was useful when we first wanted to go to Universal Studios, but it was only a short walk away and we walked each time after that.;4
If you're only in LA for Universal Studios, this hotel is an obvious choice. It's a couple of minutes walk away from both Universal Studios and City Walk and there is a shuttle bus if you don't want to walk.  It's also a 10 minute walk to a metro station which was really handy for accessing other parts of LA. The walk back from there is up hill but there's a shuttle that takes you from the bottom to the entrance to Universal which is great if you don't want to walk.  The room I had was massive, and while I could see the freeway from there, the noise didn't bother me. All the staff I met were helpful and friendly so no complaints there. The amenities in the room were good and the bed and sofa were comfortable. I can't comment on the food as I ate at City Walk, but the buffet;4
Very nice location and helpful staff.  I read the reviews of this hotel and expected to see some pet damage.  I did not.  We arrived earlier than we expected.  I did not feel well and the staff was able to get us our room early which was really appreciated.  The decor was fine.  Bed was on the hard side, but the pillows were quite nice.  Everything was clean.  The toilet in our room was broken and it took a few tries to get someone to answer the phone, but otherwise, I have no suggestions for the hotel.  My husband and I stayed here for just one night.  I would definitely stay here again.;4
Have stayed at the Hilton Universal two years running and am always pleased. Check in not necessarily the fastest, but the buffet is second to none and breakfast pleasingly replete. Car parking a tad pricey, mind.;4
"We checked in on a Friday evening in April. Check-in was quick and valet parking was simple. The hotel is a very busy place.; always a crowd hustling in and out. We stayed in a standard room with a double bed. Our room was on the 35th floor. The room itself was tiny which is where the ""4/5 rating comes from. The bathroom does not have a counter or vanity making it difficult to store your toiletries and use a curling iron/ hair straightener. It took us a couple of minutes to find an outlet in the room. Once we moved a night stand we found one. I was surprised they didn't have them more accessible. There was no space to walk around the room which was fine as we didn't spend a lot of time in there. The view was incredible! The room itself was a bit outdated but absolutely spotless";4
"I stayed here from 19 - 23 Sept (4 nights) and after some of the reviews I'd seen beforehand, I was apprehensive about what the hotel was going to be like.  Fortunately, everything was fine.  Yes, the hotel is a bit ""dated"" but it's clean, the room was great and it has plenty of facilities (fridge, microwave, coffee, internet access, free breakfast, swimming pool, etc)  What do you expect for the money?!  I really do think that some people want a 5 star hotel experience for the cost of a 2/3 star and when they don't get it, they write a bad review.  I think if you want a 5 star hotel, pay for a 5 star hotel and then write a bad review if it doesn't live up to your expectations!  Anyway, back to the hotel: Good points  1. Great location for metro and buses.  Don't even think";4
Stayed here for 2 nights.  First impressions of this lovely hotel was good, looked a little shady from the outside, but when you walk in, you are greeted by a concierge who welcomes you, the inside is very modern at looks exclusive. Front desk personal are helpful og and very nice. You get a free Fiji water every day!!  The hotel position is great, nearby subway will take you any where, at is minutes from the hotel. Central Park and Columbus cirkel is right outside. Great area.  We got an upgrade on our room, so we got at superior room with 2 queen size beds ðð»ðð». Unfortunately there is a big noisy ventilation-tube right out side our window. The staff was understanding and offered us a new room. ðð».  The bathroom could use and major update.   I would definitely stay here;4
Perfect location Beside underground bus takes on time to get anywhere!!! Look up bus maps before coming to get familiar with it Cheap breakfast nearby on broadway as well as McDonald's and subway Free street Parking if ur willing to drive around for 20 mins to find it- we had to move car twice so cost us nothing to park. No Internet never worked and rooms are clean but really old and well who cares??! You will be out.  Walk to Seinfeld restaurant from show. Got it cheap on rentaroom.com;4
On Sep 2019 my husband, my kid and I stayed for a night at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City. Was a very good overall experience.   Big Hotel, nice pool area.  LOCATION: The hotel is walking distance to Universal Studios (which is why we were there). We parked at the hotel and walked to universal. They have a shuttle, but we didnât use it.   ROOMS: Our room 2065 was large with two full beds. -	Views: We had a view to Universal!! Overlooking Hogwarts.  -	Illumination: The room itâs very well illuminated, lots of lamps and spots. Just how I like it. -	Beds: Very good mattress. I slept very well. -	Noise: No noise. -	Cleanliness: It was clean.  SERVICE: The staff is respectful but could be more friendly. -	Wi Fi: Fast. -	Swimming Pool: Big pool, very nice lawn with chairs,;4
Efficient staff and helpful concierge but bar staff unbelievably arrogant and aloof. Good rooms, comfortable beds and we had a good view of Broadway. Noisy traffic but hey this is NYC. convenient for Central Park and Midtown.;4
The hotel is a boutique style. friendly staff, cozy, comfortable and clean. no luxury items but good enough for a family vacation. Breakfast was also very good. Convenient  location that is close to Universal studio and downtown LA. Overall I would recommend it.;4
I am a frequent daysinn user. This hotel was clean and was perfectly located to subway. the restaurants are fair to good and having coffee within walking distance was perfect. Don't have high expectations. Some rooms from the 11floor up have been redone but the rest have not. However, the carpet was clean and I was not to impressed with the blankets and coverlet. The room did its job a place to sleep and leave my stuff.;4
The hotel is a good value for money and the location is superb! . The rooms are comfortable although on the small side. There is no coffee making facilities in the room but there is a Starbucks and MacDonald's across the road The staff is very friendly and help full. The lady concierge is extremely knowledgeable and has excellent tips for eating places in different places in NY and also, what time is the best visit a specific location. There is a lovely restaurant next door to the hotel with an entrance from the hotel foyer. Will definitely stay there again when in New York;4
There are many good things about this hotel - the close location to Universal Studios, we just walked rather than take the shuttle - the room service was on time and the food was good - the Cafe Sierra had great service and good food.  But, the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the smoke detector was disabled, even though I brought it to the attention of the front desk twice.   Our first morning I told the front desk there were towels placed in the window sills and asked if the windows leak, or were they left by prior guests?  They removed those towels later that day, but also one that belonged to us.  The next morning I realized the smoke detector was wrapped in plastic, so when we were leaving for the day, I asked the front desk to return our towel and remove the;4
Cute little boutique hotel.   Great location.  Very close to Times Square. Room was very small but it was fine as we were hardly in it.  Would stay here again as the location was perfect for us.  The hotel is attached to the Steven Colbert show building.;4
Room was a Queen room, number 2015, felt very claustrophobic but very clean, No tea/coffee making facilities which was dissapointing. A definite NO NO, DO NOT use hotel Concierge Theatre Booking Facilities, we booked to see Jersey Boys which being our Anniversary were prepared to pay as a treat, we paid $129.95 each for our tickets with $2.00 handling fee ($261.90total), yes we were told they use a booking agent so appreciated that some money would go to them but when we picked our tickets up before the show, the actual face value was only $62.00 each. Complained to the hotel Theatre booking Concierge at the fact we paid more than double the value and that was daylight robbery but very indignant response, 'No refunds regardless, that's what we charge through our booking agent'.;4
This is my favorite hotel at LAX. Completely refurbished, closest hotel to the airport, good and friendly service, nice modern rooms, good lobby with a nice bar and restaurant and reasonable price. Highly recommended!!!;4
I stayed at the Days Inn for one night (Sun-Mon) and I enjoyed it. I was on the 4th floor, King size bed. Walk in closet, bathroom is small. My room was nice and cool. Do bring your own shampoo as the one they have is about 1 oz. 1oz lotion. There are plenty of towels to shower with, hand towels, 2 small soap bars, hair dryer. I didn't bring any makeup but they have a special mirror just for putting on your makeup. Only 1 elevator working (left side). The floors are small. (This is NYC) They have a soda machine, wished they had a snack machine. There is a Duane Reade around the corner. 1,2,3 Subway is 2 blocks away on 96th St. Plenty of places to eat, even McD.   Great for couples, or if you're looking for a solo stay like me, you will like it!   Occasionally you hear cabs;4
This may not be a glamorous hotel, but it is worth the lower cost that you can get a room for. The location is great, subway was a few steps away and only two stops from Time Square. Easy! When the carpet and halls looked old I was weary of what the room would look like, but was pleasantly surprised. Our bathroom was small but very clean and nice. The beds were nice and our heater/cooler worked great! We would stay here again, no problem! When we checked out they even held our luggage in a room for us until 10:30pm when we came back for it! Thanks Days Inn!;4
Very nice hotel and location for Fordham business/visit. Only issues were the beds were a bit firm for my taste and the street noise was loud but it was a Friday night.  Maybe some noise machines (rain, waves woods etc) should be provided.;4
we liked the room, the splendid view and the closeness to the subway and Chinatown. what we did not like was the lack of water in the shower. we asked for that to be fixed and that we might get wash cloths for a sponge bath but nothing happened.;4
Stayed here for 3 nights and although the room was small, it was ok for the time we spent in there. A coffee maker would have been beneficial. Its location was great for exploring New York, walking distance to lots of great places.;4
"This is truly a 3-star hotel - not too fancy, needing a little updating. HOWEVER, the location is SUPERB - across the street from Lincoln Center, short walk to Columbus Circle and Central Park, and in a very safe area. YOU CAN'T beat the location and the price. We were in a ""Junior Suite"" which was LARGE by most hotel standards, much less NYC standards. I would definitely stay there again, and our whole family really enjoyed the stay.";4
I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel, as i had read some pretty bad reviews about it before I went in November 2012. The hotel for me was more about a nice space to chuck my suitcase and get a nice comfy sleep. My check - in was prompt and the concierge was very helpful. My room (standard) was a nice space for two and the bed was very comfy. My room was located one floor below the rooftop bar, when the window was open you could hear the odd group chatting but nothing that kept me up all night. The only thing that did make me worry was some of the things they say they charge you for like bath robes, umbrellas, etc weren't in my room when I checked in (not that I wanted them) but thankfully I was not charged for something I never had. Overall this hotel is really elegant and;4
We recently stayed at the Empire Hotel for business.  I was familiar with the hotel from the famous sign (of course!), and seeing the property on several blogger's Instagram feed.  The hotel is located steps away from Lincoln Center, and convenient to the Columbus Circle metro stops.  The interior is beautiful and sophisticated, with a great vibe to the lobby.  Front desk crew and valet are all warm and extremely helpful.  As with many NYC older hotels, the rooms can be stifling in the winter.  We couldn't cool down our room from 76 degrees, so the front desk executed a switch right away.  The updated rooms with doubles have a clever sleeping arrangement, with each bed placed apart, and the sq footage was a welcome surprise.  The fitness center needs updating if that is an;4
The location is one of the best in NYC.   Pasquale and his Front Desk team are outstanding and welcoming to this consumer who has visited The Empire over 30+ visits  in 2 years.   However, the changes by management are very disappointing.  The Facility Fee ($20) which includes 2 small bottles of water and free WiFiâminus the in room minibar and the Keurig coffee  machine is very disappointing.  Perhaps management will reconsider their position regarding the Facility fee and in room  amenities.;4
Older, but iconic, New York hotel and we loved the Art Deco style.  Corridors to the bedrooms are a bit shabby but the room (albeit on the small side) was adequate - and clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was dated but, again, it was clean and functional.    Tik Tok diner is worth a visit.  Location is perfect.  Would definitely stay again.;4
If you are looking for a low budget, clean, basic, safe, nice and easy hotel - this is perfect.  (for luxery, big rooms and extra facilities you have to pay more.)  We are a young couple who looked for a clean, basic central hotel, and I'm glad we picked Astor.  Very close to the metro, easy to get to the center of NY. And you could walk across the street and into central park, which we did:)  We came early in the morning are the room wasn.t supposed to be ready for 7 more hours, but the staff arranged so we got a room after only 30min and could sleep off our jetlag. They were also very helpful when we had some trouble with a stolen credit card(not from the hotel).  Great service - both day and night. The beds were good, and we slept well. the bathroom was nice and the hole room;4
Stayed one night with my two teenaged sons. We were on the 13th floor. Although the elevator was slow, and the corridors dark, we were upgraded to a suite, and we had a really good stay.Clearly, the hotel is under renovation - there is scaffolding on the building which is really hard to miss - but the bed linen was spotless, and we were not disturbed by any loud noises. The staff at reception were friendly and efficient.;4
Weâve stayed at the Empire for years now, because we have tickets to the Metropoitan Opera. We love going greeted by Eugene and Chris. They are terrific. Dennis also at the front door makes us feel welcome too. The hotel is alsays clean, though it could use some updating.;4
Great place. All the people treat you so lovely there. Bring your sandals because the beautiful marble floor is cold. The rooms are quiet big. The patio area is amzing too. You can read your book there and no one will bother you. Also the maids ate very attentive to your needs. The staff at concierge area very nice people. The morning food is complement.;4
Bith the food and service were great! They were quick and had plenty of options for the kids. They also kept the coffee flowing, which is critical for the adults. Our server, Javier, was fast and attentive.;4
I travel to NY often for business and this is the first time I've stayed at the Empire Hotel.  I was impressed when I arrived at the hotel with perfect customer service from the doormen to the front desk staff.  I wish I got the name of the doorman as he was outstanding.  I did get the name of the front desk attendant, Nick, and he made me feel like I had come home.  It was so nice because I have been up since 5a and didn't check in until 630p, so needless to say I was exhausted.  The room and bathroom are perfect and I will be back!;4
Only problem I have with this hotel is there are no free WiFi in the rooms which is unusual. Location is absolutely fabulous, bang in the middle of Times Square with plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, local supermarkets around. My room view was not particularly nice, the windows were quite dirty and just an old building block but that didnât bother me too much. Doormen Jeffrey and another guy which I didnât catch the name of but works the morning shift are both fab guys who are very helpful and polite.;4
The standard room we stayed in for two nights with double beds was clean and comfortable for our family of four. My only little issue was that the water in the bathroom sink drained slowly. The shuttle to citywalk was very convenient. Also, the walk there did not feel long at all. There were asian lions dancing in the evening for the lunar new year which my young children really enjoyed.;4
My husband & I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for two nights & enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in walking distance to Penn Station & MSG. If you are coming to NYC to see a show at the Garden, definitely stay here. From the minute we walked into the lobby, we were greeted by Mohammed at the guest services desk. He checked us in, asked us our room level preference & called up to the room before we settled in to make sure we were satisfied with the room. The hotel is clean, reasonable & quiet with friendly staff. You felt secure when going to the elevators to the rooms because security made you show your key.  The room was very clean & comfortable. The location is close to the High Line & Broadway as well. We will definitely stay at the Wyndham New Yorker again in the future.;4
We stayed at Holloywood hotel in late April, 2011 and have enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again the next time when we are in LA.  Pros - Room is clean and the size is decent - The beds are super comfortable with nice set of pillows and the sheets - Good selection of buffet breakfast with good cold and hot meals - Wifi high speed internet - The hotel has a sauna and a pool if you want to use - Friendly staff. We left some personal belongings behind after we left LA. We contacted the hotel and they happily posted the belongings to the hotels of our next destination in San Francisco - The hotel is half a block away from the LA metro and is only 4 stops (approx 10 minutes) to Chinese Theatre and Walk of the fame, etc  Cons - The hotel is not located right on the Hollywood;4
The hotel is situated in a very good position, at 2 blocks from Central Park and it's only 50 mt. far from the subway stop, then in 5 minutes you arrive in Times Square! Friendly and helpful Reception staff.Not cheap hotel for 2 stars and very aged room with old moquette and old wall-paper but good heating in winter time. If you trip to New York I highly reccomend this hotel for its good position in a nice district (Upper West Side);4
The staff were great !! We had a great time in the down stairs bar!  Everyone were very helpful and friendly. We will be using this hotel when my son performs at the Met . Everything I needed on my trip were within walking distance;4
Excellent location - very close to Macy's and Fashion Ave - close to Penn Station for Trains, Subway and believe it or not a full service Tim Horton's!! Rooms and property were very clean, secure and comfortable.  Enjoyed being able to walk to dinner every evening and also enjoyed the Bell/ Security Staff who are great ambassadors to the New Yorker hotel and to the City of New York.;4
I had stayed here previously with my Husband in 2010 so knew the location was ideal and was happy to return this time with my daughters. We took the train from Newark, only 30 minutes and Penn Station is literally just across the road from the Hotel, very simple, straightforward and a bargain at $13! We had requested a high room so was a little disappointed to be allocated the 20th floor but went up with an open mind. I knew the rooms were small but we had paid for a Metro view and this room only had a tiny window looking down at McDonalds. I went back down to reception and expressed our disappointment, especially as the trip was to celebrate my daughterâs 30th Birthdays. They allocated us a different room straight away, we just had to wait for it to be cleaned. What a result!;4
Have been to NYC several time but this was the first time at this hotel.  The hotel is huge, the staff are friendly and the rooms are a decent size for New York.   The hotel is close to the Garden so if you're going to a concert or game this location is perfect. There are a ton of homeless people around the hotel though so be prepared to be hassled going in and out of the hotel. Still a good hotel though.;4
under refurbishment which is need but usually room rates are lower during this period. + Noise due to construction, no room service during kitchen makeover. very convenient to Lincoln center and staff very pleasant and helpful from start to finish.;4
This was our second stay at the Empire Hotel and we plan to return again.We enjoyed our stay with one exception which was discussed earlier in this survey. The staff is wonderful and we even received a  complimentary upgrade upon our arrival. A very nice surprise! It made us feel very special!;4
We had a great time at the New Yorker. Our room had an outstanding view, the location was perfectly situated near the subway, Times Square and Madison Square Garden! The staff was outstanding and the Tick To k diner was awesome!;4
Some of the rooms were run down but there are also rooms that have been revamped and look great and are very comfortable if you are staying to work in LA . Breakfast was fr\ee with your room and it was actually quite good but you had better get there very early as they are always late . Wireless works great most times and TV and Cable are great addition for the price that you pay. It s very close to Hollywood whihc is where I was working;4
"Visited for an overnight while at the nearby theme park. The facilities are clean and maintained, if a bit dated. Best thing about the hotel is the staff. From valet, to front desk, to restaurant, everyone was professional and helpful.  Our room on the âexecutive floorâ was decent size, with a large bathroom and my favorite: a magnnifying mirror for doing make-up etc. Well done Hilton!   Iâm deducting one star only because the Executive Floor no longer has its own lounge; huh? Whatâs the point?  Overall a pleasant stay, and I would visit again.";4
Older hotel in the heart of the action. We upgraded our room because the standard room was so small.  If youâre looking to do NY on a budget this is your place. Next time I will spend more money and go to a newer hotel.;4
Very large hotel, well restored with a lot of character. Many elevators, but not sure they all work as we always seemed to wait for the same two.  Security visually looks at your key before approaching the elevators so safe feeling. Everyone was nice.  Two restaurants on site, one is 24 hours and more casual, the second serves food to about 10pm, with bar open for a few hours after.  Bathrooms and room s in general are very small, typical of New York hotels in the city.  Doorman does not assist you at any point in time, nice touch however just wave hello as he is probably on his cell phone anyway. Housekeeping forgot to refresh my room for two days, so keep an eye out for them.  Everyone at checkin was very nice.;4
Stayed during a weekend for a convention and have no major complaints. The room was very clean and you can't hear any of the airplanes coming and going from LAX. The shuttle to and from the airport for free was a nice touch. The room was a little on the small side and food was expensive, but that is to be expected in any hotel. I would definitely return to this hotel.;4
Stayed for only one night in May 2013, what made our stay memorable was the service provided by Pamela on the front desk and Amanda in the restaurant. These two ladies were incredibly friendly and went above and beyond in their whole approach. This hotel, whilst comfortable is probably due for a makeover, however this was offset by the great service we enjoyed, far surpassing our experience the previous 4 nights at the beverly Hilton which was significantly more expensive but much poorer in service. I would definitely stay again if visiting universal studios, so convenient.;4
This hotel is perfectly situated for a stay in New York, you can get to any sight from here via waking, subway or slightly further via taxi. The hotel has a grand reception area but is quite busy, especially in December. It seemed that it had been taken over by fellow Brits! The room although a little small was very comfortable  and had a great view of both the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. We stayed for 3 nights and were very happy with our stay and would return. The only thing that is a little silly is this $10 per night resort fee supposedly to cover Wi-fi and calls? Itâs not necessary and didnât really get it, either drop it or include it in your rates.  All in all a great hotel, we had a very nice stay.;4
C'mon, Trip Advisor advisors, cut the Empire Hotel some slack. Rated 331 out of 466 hotels in NYC? Gimme a break!  Yes, the Empire is a bit pricey, and yes, the rooms and bathrooms are small, but, hey, this is new York. And, too, the elevators are pretty slow. But consider:  *The beds are great, and so are the pillows.  *There's a Starbucks within45 seconds and a Duane Reade in another 10.  *Bar Boulud, Boulud Sud, Picholine, and Lincoln are minutes away on foot. Telepan and CafÃ© Luxembourg are a ten-minute stroll away.  *There's an 8th Avenue subway stop a block and a half away.  *The area is crawling with taxis--except when you want one at 6 p.m.  *The lobby bar is lively.  *It's AT the Met (why my wife and I go there). And the Philharmonic. And the NYC Ballet. And other stuff;4
This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and my feelings are he same. This former Ramada Hotel (left the franchise to save costs) has some of the rooms of a higher quality indeed (not the ones you get half-price though) and then other rooms which have not seen refurbishment yet and are a bit dated, yet spacious, with terrace and sofa in the room, microwave, coffee/tea facilities. To be honest, unless you are prepared to pay 4 star quality at over 100 dollars/night, there isn't much choice in Hollywood. Hollywood is a contrast of poverty and wealth and the affordable hotels happen to be near tube stations, in areas to be questioned. if you want a fantastic hotel in the middle of the action then choose the Hollywood Highland (Rennaissance) at double the price. At the;4
This hotel could have it all - great location, rooftop lap-pool and deck, Daniel Boulud nearby and wonderful Lincoln Centre view - when we went we were upgraded, the suite room was large and well designed, the beds were great but the level of freshness of the walls carpets and curtains and noise at night reduced the pleasure somewhat. More fun for sexy couples than jolly families as the deck and lobby seem more trendy than family. With a little more care - it could be really super. Glad we chose it, just wish they washed it more !;4
Good value for a west side Manhattan hotel.  Stayed in the bunk bed room.  Small, but when we spent all day out and about, its worth it.  Baths are nice.  Hotel is also a 2 minute walk from a parking garage.;4
Recently took a trip to NYC with family and stayed at Empire Hotel.  First time there.  Was pleased with location (right across from Lincoln Center) The staff was very helpful, knowledgeable and courteous.  Lobby was nice.  Parking was reasonable considering the location where hotel is located.  Decor was nice.  Room was spacious (had a Junior Suite).  Bathroom was tight but not a huge deal.  Pool was also small but kids still enjoyed it.  Restaurant attached to hotel (PJ Clarkes) was convenient and good food.  Overall great place to stay at a reasonable price and great location in NYC.;4
Our room felt very small at first, but eventually that didn't bother us. It was also clean, but a little bit out of date. The location of the hotel is really good, however there is nothing to see in the neighbourhood, but the metrostation is really close. The staff was really friendly and you could ask anything from them. The breakfast was pretty good and there were always lots of things to choose from plus there was staff who made you omelets of your own choice which was great. I you are thinking of renting a car in L.A, I would also recommend the company which was inside the hotel. All in all, I was pleased with the hotel and I would definetly stay there again.;4
Overall good but suite was not ready until 330 pm despite me registering at noon and requesting check in at 1 pm the day before via email. Also package left at concierge for me not delivered ! I had to fetch later in the evening after having them look for it!;4
Generally speaking, I found the hotel to be a very nice facility.   There was however an issue with my room which being brought tot he attention of the maintenance staff was not sufficiently resolved.  The room maintained an average temperature of around 80 degrees, even with the (noisy) air conditioning unit running and producing cold air.  The excessive noise resulted in needing to raise TV volume, and difficulty talking on the phone.  Otherwise, I found the hotel to be a nice facility.  Hopefully this was an isolated experience, and the impact was limited to my room.;4
It is an older hotel so do not expect anything else. Rooms are small but clean and functional. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Prices are very reasonable. Centrally located to Penn Station and the subway to every other attraction. The staff were friendly and very helpful. There are several restaurants attached to the hotel. We tried the Tick Tock diner. The food was very tasty and again service was exceptional. This is an older hotel. Rooms are going to be smaller, and somewhat outdated. The rooms are clean,  staff is friendly and helpful, prices are very reasonable, and it is centrally located. We enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again.;4
Everything was ok. Nothing special, no fireworks, but still ok. Comfortable bed and quite quiet, although the fact, that airport was behind the window. As a minus you have to pay 3 $ for a bottle of water, which should be free as for such price... almost 250$ for a night for a couple...;4
This was our first visit to New York and we will certainly come back and would highly recommend the Empire Hotel.  It's ideally situated for central park and uptown.  The service was exemplary and nothing was too difficult for the staff.;4
Before arriving and after reading reviews, I thought about getting ready to ask to upgrade our room as soon as we checked in so that we would have a view, however, after being told that we were on the 33rd floor, I thought we'd go and see the room first.   The room was very small but it did what we wanted/paid for (and we only used it for night - didn't spend much time in there at all!). I was pleased that we had a glimpse of the city, not just the side of another building, although no landmarks visible but that's fine.   The lobby is gorgeous and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Location is perfect. 10 min stroll to Times Square, under a minute to MSG and very close to fifth avenue shopping and Macy's!   First time to NYC from England and we're so glad we found this;4
Had the pleasure of staying here for a week end of July and had a thoroughly enjoyable time.   For a large hotel of 24 floors they delivered a great level of service in the restaurant, bar, reception areas - everyone helpful.   Bedroom was huge with good facilities a,thought would have benefited from a little updating. Small gym was ample and outside pool perfect to relax after long walks and exploring the area;4
Good location. Wife wanted to stay here because of the tv show. The doorman was super helpful. Walking distance to Central Park and Columbus circle. Eating not as close as Iâd hope but overall good location.;4
Our stay was great. The beds and pillows were fantastic. I appreciate comfortable beds as someone who has had multiple back surgeries. Sleep in comfort and woke up without pain.;4
I must admit, having read a few of the reviews on this site my wife and I were a little apprehensive about our stay at this place.  However I am pleased to report it is a smashing place in a great Manhattan location.  Our stay was excellent value (roughly Â£60 a night through Expedia) for a decent sized double room.  It was sparsely furnished but clean and the bed was comfortable.  Although we did not have a private bathroom (I don't think any of the rooms do), our room had a washbasin and there were two bathrooms (one with a bath, one with a shower) right across the corridor.  They weren't lined with marble, but they weren't sick-inducingly disgusting either.  The room was spruced up each day by a maid, and we had a small fridge, TV and telephone in the room along with a;4
Can't fault the location. Incredibly located to explore Manhattan. Everything is pretty much walking distance and for this reason alone I would stay here again.  The rooms and the service is adequate. Rooms are clean and comfortable. We stayed in a metro room which was decent sized. Bathrooms need some modernisation. There is a large turnover of guests so the front desk staff don't waste time smiling or being friendly. Expect short and tired responses.  John the concierge also tried to pull a fast one on me by trying to overcharge me for my shuttle at point of departure when the night before he'd confirmed a different rate!;4
It is a good location if you are visiting the universal studio but make sure to check you AC before you open your luggage in the room. I spent the night with their technical person trying to fix it and he did not fix it and brought us a fan in the room. Ruined my night  So check the AC before you get settled in the room and if it is working well, it is a good and clean hotel to stay at. Not cheap though;4
"I think one's feelings about this hotel will be related to the rate they pay.  I was here for the NYC triathlon, which wa just before the 4th of July and paid stay rates were $330 per night.  Fortunately I had Wyndham points to cash in, because no way was this hotel worth that.  By contrast, I weent across the river to Brooklyn-- 20 minutes by metro for the next 3 nights and paid $84 per night, though not as good I would not say only 25% as good- maybe 75%-80%? So again, depends on the rate. So I will give my pluses and minues from here and you can decide if these are helpful  + location (but almost anywhere in Manhattan is depending on why you are there; here you are by Madison Square Garden, Penn station with very short walk to Time Square /Rockefeller Center in one direction";4
Pros: above average complimentary breakfast (eggs cooked to order and mini-waffles), very near metro line (easy access to Hollywood Walk of Fame and Universal Studios), nice and helpful staff, decent fitness room, clean room with flat-screen TV, mini-fridge and small microwave, nice courtyard and pool, gated/secure parking. Cons: parking is a bit steep ($22 per day), location in L.A. is a bit on the seedy side (but so are huge swaths of L.A.), noise in the courtyard can carry late at night, and I found two little bugs in the bathroom on the last day (not a big deal, however). Overall, a very good place to stay for the price (except for the parking fees). I'd recommend and stay again.;4
Locationwise, this hotel could not be in a more perfect spot! Just across the street from Lincoln Center and within a five minute walk to some of the best restaurants in the world. The room was small, but immaculate and the decor was tasteful. Also, the hotel was vey quiet. The one negative was that the bathroom was ridiculously small - a very nice shower, but the toilet was smack against the sink and there was barely enough room to sit. Another drawback, there was a Keurig coffeemaker in my room, but no coffee. And housekeeping was closed so there was no one to bring me any.;4
We had a brief stay at theis hotel and it was our first time here. The staff was very friendly and very accomodating. the hotle it self was very clean and up to date. There was a little issue with the elevators being worked on, however the hotel managment made it very easy to get on and off the elevators without any issues. Perfect location and close to Universal Studios, great view. We will be staying here again!!;4
I stayed for two nights and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was after booking at such a cheap price. The room was totally adequate,with a fridge and wardrobe, two bunk beds and quite a few electric sockets. The three other people I shared with were lovely. German, Estonian and Japanese. the bed was comfortable,the quilt was very fluffy and the room was plenty warm enough(november). All in all, would recommend to anyone going to Olympia/Hammersmith area and is on a budget.;4
Just great! I searched for a long time in hotels and finally chose this hotel! We stayed there for a long time and the service was excellent, the view was amazing! You see all of New York and it's so exciting and fun. The rooms are small but very comfortable, the bed is also comfortable!;4
We stayed at the Empire Hotel for the NYC marathon and could not have picked a better location for our stay!  The hotel is very contemporary with up to date decor and furnishings. The rooms are about the size you should expect in Manhattan, and the beds are super comfy.  I loved that leopard chair in the room ... grrrrr, baby, grrrr!  The faux wood tiles on the bathroom walls and floors are very cool. I also loved the peppermint-lavender bath products. Smelled so good!    It was a short walk over to Central Park for race activities, and it was also very convenient to the finish line of the race. Nearby there are several good restaurants (Rosa Mexicano, The Smith) where you can grab a bite to eat and a drink.    Two thumbs up. If I'm ever back on the UWS, this will be my hotel of;4
My first time staying in New York!  Very good hotel.  My room was standard but nice.  Bed very comfortable but a few concerns:::damp on closet floor and light toilet noise first night.  After a long day of touring and on second evening toilet wouldn't stop flushing..just aweful....called front desk and every number on room phone but no answer.  I called 1-800 fir reservation who was kind enough after hearing my story to transfer me to local hotel reservation who was able to get someone to the phone.  While out of room it was fixed. I did not find too many bellman friendly.  They could smile and greet guest whether helping with luggage or not!  Bed very comfortable and hotel directly across street from Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens...I came in on the Amtrak train so;4
When you make your reservation, make sure you give them ALL the names of the people allowed to check-in.  Although I made the reservations, I was not permitted to check-in because the reservation was in my husbands name.  I had to stop him from getting our bags out of the car to get his ID.  I felt like the person taking our reservation should've addressed that since I'm female and my name is not Dave.   Once we finally got to our room, I showered, washed my hair then blew it dry only to trip the circuit breaker causing all the electricity to go out in our room for 10 minutes.  Also, watch out for the bed legs! The location is right at the ends of the bed and even though they have some sort of padding around the metal leg, we still stubbed our toe on them!!  Terrible design!!;4
We stayed there this weekend and we were greeted warmly by the doormen as well as the front desk. We valet our car for $60/ night. Close to the Lincoln center, Starbucks cafe fiorello Columbus circle.... We checked in and were upgraded to a junior suite...which was lovely, clean, great view albeit noisy..but it's nyc.. Only issue was the lack of towels. We had two without wash cloths and the shower had half door which made getting warm in the shower difficult and not luxurious.  When you pay as much as we did, you expect the basics of towels or wash cloths... They should for the price have turned down service, comp 1/2 bottle of wine, flowers...etc.. Instead they give you bottles of water for $7 or nuts for $11 to purchase in your room...not classy...but it is a nice place to;4
I've been around the world and I have stayed in a plethora of big-name, fancy, over-priced hotels.  While some were nicer than others, I've always had an issue with paying bug bucks to stay in a place when all I really want to do is shower and sleep there.  I checked around Manhattan and the cheapest hotel I could find was in the $250 per night range (plus tax) which is outrageous!  I decided to stay at the Hotel Riverside Studios instead.  For $85 a night - I am so glad that I did!    Look, it's not the Four Seasons, it's not the Hilton, it's not even a Super 8 in a rundown neighborhood.  But for the price it can't be beat in my opinion.  It's located at the very end of West 71st Street which is a dead end.  It's a totally residential neighborhood and just around the corner is;4
Perfect location, across from Lincoln center and convenient walk to all surrounding sites...chic, modern and very impressive.. Rooftop bar is under remodel but hopefully will be open in October when I return for another great NYC weekend getaway.;4
"Second visit.  Staff continue to impress, minor issues with mechanical things.  Next to Lincoln Center and flanked by busy streets, but windows kept the noise out well enough for this light sleeper.  (Two ""inside"" courts.  Little view, little noise.)  Relatively good value for money.  (This is New York, though.)";4
"My husband and I stayed two nights before leaving on a vacation flight to the South Pacific and again when we returned from the vacation. We loved our room for the outgoing portion of our trip because it was a corner room on the 10th floor and very quiet as we had requested.  The room itself was very clean and appointed in modern, fairly sparse decor, which suited us fine. We had plenty of space to store our suitcases and clothes as well as our toiletries.  We especially  loved the Unity Restaurant and open market restaurant, which delivered surprisingly excellent food! We had fairly low expectations for an airport hotel restaurant, but were blown away by the very high quality and fresh ingredients of everything we ordered. We liked that the menu was short; it became obvious";4
The best asset of this hotel is it's location. It is located between the Lincoln center and Columbus circle metro stops, which makes getting around very convenient. A Citi bike rack is also located right in front of the hotel. Hotel was reasonably priced as we booked a few months in advance with the non-refundable rate and FBSAVE15 code. The hotel stored our luggage both on our day of arrival and departure. Our biggest complaint was that the wifi was not free. I'm not sure if this is standard in NYC, but it was certainly annoying. They also charged me for something from the hotel fridge (which we did not use), but removed the charge when I asked about it upon check out. I saw another reviewer mention this, so be sure to review any charges before departing. Overall, a nice hotel;4
Our family stayed at the hotel 4 nights. We could not have stayed more convenient on Manhattan! The hotel is very old, and you can really feel it, when inside. It has a lot of atmosphere though, and it feels very genuine.  The hotel feels a bit run down, but it is clean. The rooms are VERY small - it is actually difficult to even unpack your suitcase. Be aware that staying in the very heart of Manhattan, means that you will be in one of the noisiest places on earth, so if you want calm and silent, this is not a place and hotel for you.;4
Loved the nostalgia of the hotel. The beautiful lobby, the updated beds, the history museum downstairs, all very nice. Front desk staff always more than accommodating. We had a room with a balcony, which was a real treat. Being able to step out on the 22nd floor and having a pretty cool view of the NYC skyline, was a real treat.;4
I'm not accustomed to staying in a big city so this was new to me.  I expected at $300 a night it would be a similar room to what I've stayed in at other locations (cities but not as big as NYC).    The room was really small.  But it was clean.  I'm not sure if the odor was in the room or just the city in general.    By default, there is no coffee maker in the room.  You can request one.  I did this the second day after reading other online reviews.  Along with the coffee maker, I got a bag of four paper cups, a bunch of pods of coffee and tea.  But they never replaced anything that I've used so by the end of my stay, I was struggling to have coffee and tea when I wanted it.  It was hard to find a location to sit my coffee maker.  The small table was big enough for my laptop.  I;4
Overall everything was fine, friendly staff, especially in reseption. Doormen were very helpful too. Room was clean and spacious. There was fridge and closet which was great. Floor 35 with spectacular views!;4
Nice hotel in good location. Close to Lincoln Center where we were going. Rooms are a bit dated and elevator is slow but the service made up for it. Dan Burke at the front desk was exceptional. We had a bit of a mishap with our reservation booking it for the wrong date and started to panic a little. Dan fixed it and made us feel so comfortable. I gave this 4 stars for his service and making us feel so welcomed. Staff was friendly throughout. Dan stood above the rest. Thanks Dan!!;4
The Empire Hotel's location is convenient and staff is very friendly. They go out of their way to accommodate me and make sure my stay here is pleasant. I just came back from touring many cities in Europe, I have to say I like the Customer service from US much better. :-) Julia: Thank you!;4
Great experience during our 4 day stay at the Empire for my wife's birthday.  Friendly, helpful staff with modern amenities.  Restaurant and bar were both well maintained.  Slow WiFi however a small issue in the overall stay.;4
Perfect location, swift and easy check in on arrival.  Room was rather small, considering we were staying for 5 nights, both myself and my other half had large suitcases which really had nowhere to go in the room. We did however manage to rearrange things slightly and make more room.  The room itself was lovely, comfortable and well decorated just too small. Not sure whether the receptionist knew we had been given a tiny room and gave us the WiFi password as a bit of a perk (much appreciated!).  Free tea and coffee in a morning was a nice little perk although in room facilities would be better (maybe not possible in the small rooms). Bathroom was clean and tidy, shower was huge in comparison to the rest of the room!  All concierge staff were great but Jeff was a fab character,;4
comfortable hotel in good location in Midtown. Kind staff always available. good quality of the room (Queen Standard) and efficient housekeeping. we didn't use others services and we can't give our opinions.;4
Pros:  Stylish, updated hotel in a location convenient for seeing the sites or for business.  Rate on a very large room by NY was a great value.  Cons:  Our room didn't have a proper closet, it was a small cubby but too short to hang dresses in.  Also bathroom has zero counter space, difficult for getting ready.  Also, shower is open on one side causing a lot of water damage to the bathroom door.   Also, if you're on the 11th floor, which we were, expect a lot of noise from the rooftop nightclub.;4
"Worth the stay! Close to the Garden, Penn Station and of course the Tic-Toc cafÃ© which is right next store and can be accessed through the hotel lobby (important when it is snowing).  My only gripe is the room size.  It is an old hotel that is constantly making renovations, so your room will or should be modern and up to date; however, some of the rooms are really small, so when you check-in make sure the rate reflects the size.  I really do not worry about room size when I am in New York since I do not plan on spending much time in the room, so let that be your guide.....";4
I was in NYC with my wife (late 40s) for a second city break, for 4 days.  Good: The hotel is old and outdated and needs a full refit. Some will see that as bad, but I love the old Art Deco styling (see photos) Staff were very helpful Lifts were good. Like 5-6 for floors 1-20 and other side for 21-40. Only had a longish wait once. On-site restaurant food is good, as is the ticktock diner, albeit expensive. Location is excellent, certainly from transport perspective. Penn station is round corner which is a main hub. You can get easily to JFK via airtrain, LIRR, subway Beds are amazing, so comfortable, we both  had great sleeps  Bad: Rooms very small. We 'upgraded' to a room with a view. Not sure about that! Not a fault with hotel per se, but the area stinks of weed. Like every;4
This was my second stay in this hotel, 1st one was about 9 years ago in a tiny room with no view, this time there were 4 of us, 2 13yr old boys who cannot share a bed due to dangly limbs and myself and my other half. We decided on a suite as on of the boys could have the pull out sofa. We arrived a little early for check in (about 30 mins) and were advised to try again in an hour, we came back in 2, still not ready, very apologetic and gave us vouchers for breakfast the next day. We took this opportunity to see if the queues were bad in the Empire State Building and went there (no queue) came back to find the room ready. Nice big living area and 2 small double beds in a separate room. We let the boys have them as the pull out bed was bigger and suited us better. We slept really;4
After reading some of the reviews, we were a bit worried.  However, it was a good price in the area of the city that we wanted to be, so we went for it.  After all, we were only staying for 2 nights and knew we would be out of the hotel for most of it.  On arrival, we found the hotel easy to find, plenty of parking, with a clean and friendly lobby.  The staff booked us on to a tour of LA and the stars homes, which made life easier for us.  It was a great day and worth it.  There was some refurbishment going on to the rear car park entrance, but the front was not affected.  Our room again appeared to have been refurbished - it was large with a big comfy bed, sofa, fridge and microwave.  The bathroom was well equipped with an excellent shower and good toiletries.  We had a small;4
We stayed at Hilton Los Angeles/ Universal City for two nights prior to following our trip to Hawaii from LA. For the ones who would like to explore Universal Studios, the location is perfect since it is at 3-5 minutes drive from the park. However, if you would like to explore other hot spots from LA it is a little distant. You will certainly need a car, (what I strongly recommend LA despite the traffic). But it worths the stay. The service was impeccable. The food of the in-dinning room service was delicious and breakfast rich, although the prices were quite high.;4
"This hotel is in a great place to visit the north, west and downtown parts of LA. Rooms are clean and well-maintained, fitness room equipment is in good order, breakfast was well stocked. Parking is somewhat expensive; buffet prices (breakfast, lunch and dinner) seemed a little high, but this is a tourist destination. The staff are super friendly and helpful. Would recommend this property to others traveling to LA.";4
Just got back from spending 4 nights at The Jane..Yes the rooms are small. but for as little time I spent in the room it was great..Very clean. Good Beds..(NO bed bugs) Clean Bathrooms and yes they are down the hall. Every time I went to the bathroom nobody was there.  GREAT STAFF..Everybody friendly and willing to help you..Be sure to check out the bar. Really nice..A little over price for a drink. But still nice. Great Location. Not to far from the subway.  Be sure to go across the street to the bay for a nice walk. Or use one of the bikes the hotel has for you to use. Lots of great resturants in the area. And the area was very safe.  If you are traveling solo like myself. this place is worth it..Why pay extra for a room that you will be hardly in.   Will stay there again next;4
Terrific Bed, haven't slept better in ages.  In town for child's audition at Julliard which is literally a block and a half away.  So convenient to Lincoln Center with great dining options all around (Rosa Mexicano is a must try!) and easy walking distance to Carnegie Hall, Times Square, Ed Sullivan Theater, Central Park, etc.  Citibike Stand twenty feet from the door.  Great price for what is presumably off season.;4
"... but I should confess that it's the only New York hotel I've stayed in.  I'm a great fan of Tripadvisor; however, it does tend to rely upon someone's subjective view of the hotel. This can sometimes be coloured by how much someone enjoys their holiday.  My fiancee, girlfriend before we went to New York, and I both enjoyed this hotel. The rooms were clean and well equiped. The staff were friendly and the hotel was in a fantasic location. It's near enough to a subway station to allow easy access to the whole of the city, but at the same time, ideally located to be quiet at night.  Central Park is a delight and is worth a day by itself.  I would be happy to stay at this hotel again and can't believe there's a hotel like this available at a reasonable price.  Great hotel, great";4
I was recently for 3 nights at the Empire Hotel. The hotel was refurbished not so long ago. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I got first a very small room but the following day they move me in a much better room. The hotel is now a boutique hotel and the new decoration is creating a kind of trendy atmosphere. The rooms were very clean and the beds are surprisingly comfortable. The only negative was the noise of the Airco which was pretty rustique.b  So in few words,  the Empire is good value for money  Albert;4
Booked via Expedia.  Good rates for location.  Room furnishings- clean Space good. We had 2 double beds + bench  Very attentive staff- I had an issue with the AC on the 2nd day and they came to resolve it within 10 minutes- simple solution and fixed within 5 mins. Grateful for the AC given summer in NY. We were on the 4th floor so did not hear street noise.   Housekeeper checked on us daily.   Best subway station for this hotel is the 7th avenue station (7 th and 53rd). Walk up 7th avenue to 54th street and the hotel is just on the corner. Managed this with kids and luggage.   Hotel really perfectly situated for a walk to all major attractions in NY.   We didnât have breakfast there but would recommend Angelinaâs for pastries.   Overall super happy and would stay there again.;4
Stayed for 5 days with friends. Great location, clean rooms, size of room was what you would expect in Manhattan. Friendly courteous staff. Nice stay for the price. Very comfortable and convenient...!;4
We stayed here for 5 nights during our trip to LA. When we first arrived I was a bit disappointed as the hotel seemed in the middle of nowhere. But once we got our bearings it was easy to get to everywhere from this hotel. There are two subway stations close by where you can get to all the main locations in LA. We had a car and from the hotel we were within quick driving distance of everything. I would especially recommend this hotel if you have a car (although the car park is a bit steep but is secure).   The room was lovely and modern and had everything you could need. The breakfast we only had once - wasn't very appetising and I felt a bit ill after hence why we ate elsewhere. If you have a car there are tons of restaurants within a 5 minute drive of the hotel. Also 15;4
Great location for exploring with children, very near to a great playground, Waterloo tube station, London eye etc. Staff very helpful, bedroom great, shower over bath not great for getting in and out of and would have loved a fridge to have cold water. Gluten free toast available at breakfast along with most items from cooked breakfast. Would have appreciated some gluten free cereals and porridge pots and for this reason, we ate somewhere else on our last morning as I didnât want cooked breakfast again. Would definitely return.;4
Very nice hotel and people and well located, I'll probably come back soon ! We had a problem concerning the beds, they've changed our room as soon as one was available with no extra fee, very satisfying !;4
"Positioned right in the heart of Chinatown. This hotel is just minute walk away from the nearest Subway station and trendy Restaurants (McDonald, Subway, Starbucks etc). Warmhearted staff and fresh quaint rooms. Local television reception was unfavorable if you're a TV person - I'm not - but you have great free strong Wi-Fi.   Recommend for ""budget"" guests, ""few-days"" guests, ""overnight"" guests and ""late-bookers"" guests. You won't be disappointed ESPECIALLY with a location in lower east side Manhattan. Book early for no vacancy is viable during big events like New Years Eve.";4
We stayed as a family of 3 (2 adults and a 7 year old) in room 3201 on the 32nd Floor with a view towards the Hudson. I was expecting a small room but it was huge. Could have easily fit in 3 queen size beds and still have room to move around. The room was clean although a little outdated  No fridge or kettle was a little disappointing. The bathroom was also quite small and it took a while for the shower to get hot, but it did have great water pressure.  The gym was decent enough with a good selection of cardio and fixed weights machines. Plenty of sanitisers and a cold water filter. It could have done with Air Con though as was quite warm.   We arrived at 2pm and were checked in straight away with no queues. The reception staff were lovely. The hotel felt safe with room cards;4
My wife are on a four week trip through the west. After a long flight from Germany it was great to have a hotel so close to the airport. The driver of the shuttle bus was extremely helpful with our luggage. Reception team great fast check in,room was ok standard airport property. Hotels limo service to our car pick up was much helpful.;4
I stay here quite regularly for business. Being so close to Penn Station is extremely convenient. While the rooms are small, they are clean and the staff is friendly as can be, especially Onelia at the front desk (not sure if that is the correct spelling). They are very accommodating for early check-in needs and show genuine concern for comfort of the guests.;4
We stayed at the hotel for proximity to Universal Studios and it was great for that.  The hotel was beautiful, the pool excellent and the rooms very comfortable.  However, the food in the restaurant was outrageously overpriced and service very slow.;4
A night before the flight, we read some really bad reviews on this site and were very freightened. However, we found the room very clean, and the sheets and towels were replaced daily. It was spacious, had a closet, a television, air conditioning, a sink and a small refridgerator.  In short, it had everything we needed.  The only minus is the shared bathroom, although there were two bathrooms near our room, and almost no tenants, so there was never a line. The bathrooms weren't super-clean but not disgusting either.;4
Very nice hotel with great staff. The rooms were very nice, and we loved the pool area. My husband is a gold Hilton member and found the perks limited at this Hilton. Pricy meals for a hotel full of families visiting Universal. We enjoyed the pool and rented a cabana one day. The cabanas are rented by a 3rd party, so that was a bit inconvenient, especially when the hotel staff told us we were required to spend $75 at the pool bar, which was not part of our rental agreement. Our teens used the gym, which was located in a strange place..directly next to guest rooms. The overall layout was confusing. The lobby was on level 3 and the pool in the ground level, which made every trip on the elevator interesting. Everyone we encountered had the same confused looks in their faces.;4
We stayed in the hotel with 2 adults and 2 teens in a 2 queen size bed room. The first night we had a very small room but were then upgraded to a very comfortable room. The whole service was great. Bathroom was ok but the shower power was too strong and couldn't be regulated well. Unfortunately there was also no fridge in the room. Wifi was free and sometimes a bit slow. Beds and room service were good. We had a car but valet parking in the hotel was too expensive. We found a much cheaper parking garage only 5 min walk away via spothero.com. Breakfast is served in a diner next to the hotel but there are further opportunities around the hotel. The hotel is very central in the City and located next to a subway station. All in all we enjoyed our 5 day stay in the hotel and in NYC;4
The hotel is in a really good area and with amazing price. The room is small, but very comfortable. The shower is amazing. Despite the area, the hotel is very quite, what is essential to sleep after long walks in NY. The hotel is few minutes from Central Park and a small walk to Times Square.;4
Courteous doorstaff greeted me when my cab arrived. I only stayed one night, and was pleased that I was able to check-in early, at 1 pm. I wish I had had more  time to use the beautiful pool.  My room was beautiful. It was on the 15th floor, with a great view, a king size bed, and a bathroom that was larger than some hotel rooms I've visited. Small vanity area, with a seat, as well as a large sink area, great shower. The King size bed was very comforatable. Room and bathroom were spotless.  The nicest surprise for me was a platter with bananas, an apple, a tangerine, a candy apple and chocolate that I found when I returned to the room after the event I attended. Maybe I just lucked out? It made a nice impression, and I was especially grateful since I happened to be hungry  when;4
This hotel in a great location for exploring the city.  Literally 2 min walk to the metro and 2 min walk to Central Park.  The hotel is very contemporary.  The rooms were spacious, huge beds, and very clean and modern bathroom.  Some parts of the room needed a lick of paint but nothing urgent.  We did not have a good view from our room apart from the air conditioning units.  If you want a decent view, ask for the front of the building.  Very friendly staff, and very helpful.;4
Not bad at all, the bed is very very comfortable and have the Tick Tick diner in the hall is surely an advantage. Considering the central position of the hotel and the cost , i would recomend it......;4
Just returned from staying at this hotel with a 7 night stay visiting the Los Angeles area on holiday, from check in to check out the service was very good with friendly staff close to Universal Studio, there was a small wait  for lifts when we stayed as all lifts were being refurbished however was much of an issue. Room was clean offered complimentary wifi in room and hotel areas comfortable beds  managed to get view of universal studios park and San Fernando valley's good choice of eating options whether grab a coffee and pastries or fruit cups from the coffee corner or cafe Sierra for breakfast with a wide variety of assorted fresh fruits hot breakfast items made to order pancakes and crepes. Very popular hotel for weddings and business conferences as during our stay was very;4
Location is it biggest advantage. About 5 minutes walk from Hammersmith underground. Comfortable beds and clean linens. They clean the place everyday. The only downside is that they kitchen does not have any utensils for cooking. Also, as I found in London, there is a more than decent chance that there might be dicey guests in the hostel. So a bit of luck is required for a good night's sleep.   Overall great value for money.;4
Stayed here for 2 nights so I could spent time at Universal Studios and Hollywood Blvd. The service here was fantastic during my stay as well as the rooms were clean and modern, also had a great view from the room. It is conveniently located next to Universal Studio's and the City Walk were there are many different food options available. The Hilton was also located close to underground train network which was only one stop away from the bright lights of Hollywood Blvd.  I would recommend the Hilton to anyone wishing to stay in LA and visit Universal Studios;4
The hotel was nice and in a great location. Itâs a little dark in the hallways and in the rooms.  The food is a bit pricey, but the staff was very accommodating and there were plenty of useful amenities. There is plenty to do and lots to eat within walking distance of the hotel.;4
Fabulous location although rooms themselves quite run down. Clean, secure, quiet. Positives outweigh no view from back side room. Tea/Coffee making in room would have been great. Also perhaps washing line in bathroom. There was always staff available and they always acknowledged us.;4
Small queue at check in, staff offered us bottled water and sweets while we waited. Prompt check in with no issues.  Our room was on the 10th floor and a corner room (think it was an upgrade from what we booked as well!) Lovely big room, massive bathroom, some areas of the room were looking a bit tired though (stains on the sofa and curtains). Plenty of wardrobe space/drawers. Hairdryer in bathroom was very good (a rare thing in a hotel!!)  Breakfast -turned out this was included in our booking, although they do complicate things with different levels/prices for breakfast, keep it simple guys that way staff and customers find it easier to navigate what they can and can not have. Be aware there are no warm plates to put your 'hot' food on to. Only one toasting station for quite a;4
My wife & I stayed here for 9 nights & didnât have a problem.  This was our first time in NY but by the middle of our stay, it was clear the location of this hotel was convenient, with Penn Station & many major attractions within walking distance.  All the front desk, reception & concierge staff we had contact with were friendly & efficient, as was the daily housekeeping service.  Because it was our anniversary we were kindly looked after with an upgrade, so enjoyed views of the Empire State & Chrysler buildings from our room.  We are happy to recommend The New Yorker.;4
Overall good expericence for the $140 plus a night room! Hipster vibe with nice location worked well for our needs! Room was nice view was not good but it's the price point that most likely determined that? Good find!!;4
Nice hotel, clean & comfy. Bathroom clean nice shower. Good location right by Times Square . Small bar breakfast not worth $11 no hot food. Can order room service that gets sent in. Staff very helpful & pleasant.;4
I have stayed here a couple times for work. Beautiful location. close to everything so that's a bonus. The rooms have always been great too, very clean and comfortable. The only complaint is that the customer service could use a bit of improvement. I understand it's a busy hotel but guests should always come first and be treated with the utmost respect since we are basically the ones paying their wages. Still not a bad place at all to go to and see all that NYC has to offer.;4
Stayed here in May 2013 and had a wonderful experience.  The service was terrific, great location!! with wonderful nearby restaurants  and minutes to walk in Central Park.  Very convenient for riding the Subway and felt that this was a very safe area.  The accommodations were very nice and loved the modern decor.  The hotel staff could not have been more courteous and accommodating.;4
Walking distance (3 blocks) to Universal Studio, but a shuttle is available too.  Beautiful Pool and great views.  Staff was wonderful.  We did a digital check in and also were able to check in early.  Some remodeling in progress, but it didn't change our experience at the hotel.;4
I booked the hotel through Amtrak rewards and got a very good price the hotel itself is classic New York architecture from the 20s 30s great location right across the street from Madison Square Garden in Penn Station blocks away from Empire State Building only a few blocks from Times Square everything in the room work which is most it hasn't 24/7 Diner to Tik Tok which I use all the time and has two smaller restaurants I want Italian in one steak house in the facility which are much more expensive than the tiktok;4
I originally booked the metro queen for 2 ppl and used my AAA discount when purchasing on the hotel's website. After reading the reviews, I was most concerned with the size of the room. Luckily, the day before arrival, I received an email offer from the hotel to upgrade to executive queen for $10/night more. To me that was totally worth it. The room was clean and spacious. Though a queen size bed, it seemed small but still do-able. Everything was renovated. Coffee/tea machine in room. Bathroom was nice, shower had super strong pressure. The bathroom itself is not spacious but again, not a big deal to me. It was clean and fresh. Toiletries were provided.  The staff was very friendly at check in. Had a meal at Tick Tock Diner and it was very good. The location was perfect. Overall;4
Rooms are very clean, staff is extremely friendly, overall I had a fantastic stay. I wish the bar area had more seating. Throughout the day you can hear the planes from your room but it's not too bad. The only issue I had was the method of paying for parking <sigh>;4
We didn't stay here but went to meet friends on the rooftop bar.  It is fabulous and the views are amazing over the Hudson and towards the WTC.  Well worth a visit and the hotel is so historic that its even more interesting than just the bar.;4
Good location. Nice, friendly staff. Room was a decent size really comfoetable beds, bathroom was a bit dated and shower not the best but okay. Excellent location and a reasonable price. Would stay again;4
"We recently traveled to NYC for Fashion Week, and stayed at the Empire Hotel.  Full disclosure:  we were part of an event with all expenses paid, so we did not choose the hotel or pay the bill.  Overall we were delighted with the Empire Hotel:  fantastic location; beautiful lobby and lounge; stylish rooms.  The beds were excellent, the duvets freshly steamed each day, luxury l'Occitane amenities.  Food served at the bar and at our events was creative and delicious.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  We were very happy with our room, although it wasn't perfect:  bulb out on one lamp, and the dresser drawer kept sliding open (we wedged a folded paper in it to keep closed.)  Our room had 2 queen beds so it was tight, but I imagine a king room felt more spacious.  Regarding";4
Was here for two days just enjoying the city. Only thing affordable but beware that prices fluctuate wildly.  My room was $119, then $169 the next night.  Last minute  travellers paid $270.  Room small but very clean.  No expanded cable, but ok tv. Bathroom spotless and renovated.  Shower hell, though, as too hot or cold. The staff is what will have me returning.  Lots of things broken but with a call they fixed all in an astonishing 5 minutes.  One desk staff even took the time (and he was busy) to try and get my laptop to connect to wifi.  Talk about customer service!!!;4
visited NYC and stayed at the Empire in early november 2011 . what a great location..across from the stunning Lincoln Center and a short walk to central park. Its a more upscale part of town and not hip happening like soho and meat packing  etc but for the older crowd who stil wants some boutique hipness , its a very central location and hotel with flair. The roof top is awesome although once the club gets going later at night the crowd is kinda hmmm..rico suave meets polyester [--]..the actual staff both in the roof top club and the front dest of the hotel(although not affiliated0..are all pleasent and proffessional..I definitely reccomend this hotel as a decent fun place to stay and the hotel bar is kinda fun to hang out in too also decent irish fare at the adjoining pub..ok;4
This hotel is cool, we were in NYC for one night to celebrate my sister bday. I'm from Harlem originally but never stayed in a NY hotel. It has it down as a four star hotel. I wouldn't say that only because there is no pool or spa but overall the rooms are small but its New York. The bed was soooo comfy and the shower was everything.. The room served its purpose. We ate breakfast at the Tick Tock diner that's in the lobby. Food was banging, will definitely eat there again. You are basically paying for the location. Smack dab on 34th street access to shopping, eating, and action.;4
Spending such a short time in New York you want to make sure you are in the right location and this hotel was just brilliant!  Oh and the bed linen was divine!!!!!! The room was small but had everything we needed, and the whole point was that we just had a base to sleep in and spend the rest of the time sightseeing!;4
Love the room and beds are great. Best post jet lag sleep!  I am annoyed by hotels that charge so much for parking. Itâs not downtown or anything and they have their own lot.  Location may be great if you come to Universal Studios.;4
This is a fabulous Art Deco building, with real character, and the location is amazing (3 mins walk to macys, and the Empire State building!). The room, altho not massive, was a fairly good size compared to other New York hotels I have been in. The bathroom was compact and a little dated, but if you are in New York City and not out and about then something is seriously wrong! The staff could not have been nicer. I would much rather stay here than a characterless big chain, and I look forward to returning. My only slight critiscsm was I couldn't get my phone to pick up the wifi signal in the room, only the iPad would.;4
Although a fair distance from Hollywood Blvd (but we knew this when booking) we still managed our way around with no issues, mainly using Ubers and we even tried a bus (although getting very lost!).  The staff were so friendly and helpful and my personal favourite part of the stay were the amazing breakfasts each morning - those omelettes can never be beaten!   We spent most of our holiday out of the hotel and using the hotel for a base to sleep and eat breakfast at, however we did use a few of the amenities whilst we were there! The pool was great, albeit very cold! And we used the sauna once too, which was quite a treat.   One downside would be that the rooms, even though the decorating and furniture seemed new, the actual decor and bathroom was old and dated. The shower head;4
Spot of for walkers and people in couples. Not really a child friendly hotel. We didnt eat there as we found the prices were too high and we could eat on a budget around various locations in NY for a more well rounded experience. And not at all far for this! On arrival rooms were ready in time as stated and the bar was really cool to come down from long flights. The hotel looks very glamorous in the lobby etc and the decor is well thought out to provide people with an extra special getaway.  The room was a great size for NY. Some wallpaper looked a little shabby in our room but overall it was fine for a place to sleep! Air con worked like a dream. Strange shower system- but who cares about that?!  Only downfall really was the officious manner of one of the reception staff. He;4
Great location.  You name it, it is right near CVS, Starbucks and etc. I would definitely stay again.  Super convenient to subway.  Love the fact need to show room key to access elevator. Only downfall is no refrigerator in the room.;4
We were there for 5 nights.  Food in the Tik Tok Diner was very good, quickly served and the wait staff were very attentive.  Close to Penn Station and subways.  Only problem was that the one shower didnât have hot water.  We had two showers so I could use the other one.;4
I really enjoyed staying at this hotel.  Pasquale at the front desk was wonderful.  The room was great as was the breakfast on the mezzanine.  Door men were so courteous and helped me find the correct direction to go.  Be prepared to pay extra for internet - daily charge - and coffee in the room.  Because there is a keurig coffee machine just bring your own coffee servings and avoid the 3 dollar a cup charge.  It was difficult to cool the room down at night even though it was winter.  However I would definintely stay here again because it was close to everything I wanted to see and do.;4
Visited with family for 16th birthday celebrations, having emailed the hotel to inform we were treated to a suite on the 40th floor, amazing views. Great location, very good value for money. The coffee at tick tock was the best we had in New York. Very clean and friendly.;4
Hotel was everything I expected.  Its old, but well kept. Nice bar/restaurant.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  The location is good because its far enough outside of Hollywood where you don't get the crazies.  Also, its right outside Universal Studios and the Universal Walk is there as well. Has many options for food and drinks.  Its also right off of the highways so getting on/off was very convienient;4
A sister trip to watch ABT's Misty Copeland dance Swan Lake at The Met, Lincoln Center.  The Empire Hotel location could not be beat on this occasion!  Special recognition to Pasquale, a great first impression at Front Desk check-in.  He is professional and friendly.   Thank you.;4
My New York trip was a work related trip which I chose to do because I couldn't bare the thought of hating New York. The Ameritania Hotel helped me re-evaluate the city of New York thanks to its location and its helpful staff!;4
This was my second stay at the Days Inn Broadway. The Upper West Side of Manhattan is a real living, working neighborhood, far from the tourist trap that is Times Square. Great mom and pop restaurants and diners within blocks of the hotel, the subway entrance is literally a 100 yards out the front door. Yes the hotel is old and has a patina on it. I don't expect pampering and luxury for the price, but the hotel has what I require in spades. It's clean, pleasant staff (if you take the time to actually talk to them), wifi and AC worked great in my room, and I even got a nice street view this time. This is such a great base of operations for a NY trip, there is NO reason to stay in midtown like most tourists think they need to. I come to NY frequently and this hotel will always be;4
This was our first visit to Los Angeles and looking at hotels we were attracted by the name of the hotel. It did not disappoint. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and a big shout out to Cecile who paid us extra attention. Our room was one of the nearly refurbished and was extremely comfortable and suited our needs. The balcony to our room was shared, but not a problem in the slightest. Our room overlooked the interior courtyard which was beautifully lit at night, but could be slightly noisy when there were guests out there late.   The hotel is very close to the metro station, Santa Monica and Vermont, which is three stops, 10 minutes, to central Hollywood. The immediate area near the hotel is not particularly tourist friendly, for example it is situated in a;4
We came from the UK to stay at the hotel for a family xmas in NYC and were very impressed by the hotel, our rooms had amazing views of the empire state building and the decor of our rooms and the foyer was very nicely and recently done up sympathetically in the art deco style of the hotel.    The large xmas tree and decorations equally added to the effect, which as xmas guests was lovely, we even on xmas eve had a visit to the childrens suite with a handmade wooden sign put onto their door for them with their names on, which I thought was a lovely touch.   Housekkeeping was excellent as was all service and nothing was too much trouble and we felt very well taken care of.   The only criticism I have of our entire stay would have to be the room service which I have to admit I;4
larger room more comfortable for couples. location excellent for lincoln centre. within walking distance of major museums and other cultural attractions. try to get an upgrade - well worth the effort.;4
We really enjoyed our stay here. Our first impression was the front desk and Afroza was an excellent ambassador. We were early and we're able to check our luggage and she called us when our room was ready. The room was much larger than expected and had an Art Deco feel that totally fit the bible of the hotel. Centrally located so we were able to walk everywhere. I would definitely stay here again.;4
Convenient & enjoyable for a Lincoln Center visit. Staff friendly, accommodating. Rooms complete with amenities  and quick response for any needs. Hoping to make this my home when visiting my Juilliard student.;4
I like the style of room and decorations but rooms were small. The completely tiled shower was nice as well and had plenty of hot water, needed after being out in the chilly November air of New York. The lobby is also very pretty and brings you back to what it must have been like a long time ago. We checked out the pictures and information on the history of the hotel as well. Pretty interesting. The hotel had iceskating performances in the past and offered a place to stay for military men coming back from war. Hotel is in great location as well. Close to Madison Square Garden and several blocks from the Empire State Building. New York was a neat place, lots of history. This was our 10th Anniversary trip;4
We chose this hotel to rest for one night after a late flight back from Hawaii. It wasn't completely obvious to the new traveler how to get to the hotel from the terminal, although there was mention of a shuttle on the hotel website. Turns out you just follow the signs for hotel shuttles after baggage claim. A shuttle for the hotel turned up within about 5 minutes. Check in was swift and well staffed, despite it being around midnight.  I loved the style of this hotel, even through my bleary eyes. Trendy graphite greys with plenty of colorful shapes to break it up. Despite being in an airport, it passed my top 3 hotel room tests. That is quiet, dark and comfortable bed. Watching the roar of LAX traffic through the window and not hearing a peep was a thing of great beauty.;4
First off - staff was great.  I ran in to dump my bags before heading to see a client.  Jazz at the front desk took my bag for me while I sprinted out of the door.   My room was good - on the very contemporary side.   A little worn.  Bed comfortable.   Fan on ON covered up street noise.  My bathroom was very small and I had to reclean my toilet seat myself.   I would stay again.;4
When compared to any other hotel in Manhattan that is in the less than $100p night category, there is no question in my mind that the Jane hotel is the best.   I must admit that I was quite frightened to stay at the Jane after reading some of the reviews. However, I can confirm that I was pleasantly surprised with my stay. Yes, the rooms are microscopic, even for NYC. Nonetheless, they are clean, safe and it really has all that you need. I was skeptical of the shared bathrooms but I also found that these were kept super clean and they were actually pretty nice. My only complaint  with The Jane is that I didn't sleep very well. Perhaps, I could blame this on the lights in the room or the sometimes noisy hallways at random hours of the night, or maybe it is because I am a light;4
Location couldn't have been better for my needs. Room clean and comfortable, great view of Time Square. Internet connection was not consistent. Would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room.;4
Very handy location for Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, mid-town subway etc. Nice quality hotel. Not cheap, but what is in New York, so good if you don't mind spending a bit more for a better location.;4
Location is definitely the selling point of this hotel, close to Times Square, Central Park, and Empire State.   When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded and was in room 214, which had a bigger bed and bathroom. To be honest, I think a room on a higher floor would have been nicer, as we had the street noise and a view of a wall. The bathroom had tape all over the window, the mirror was cracked at the bottom and the shower fitting was broken. The bed was really comfortable though and the shower powerful, and the hotel was just a base really so had all we needed.   The staff were always friendly and helpful, the lady at the bar made really good french martinis so there was a nice atmosphere in the hotel. I would go back as it was a good base in a good location.;4
Positives Great service: I came in from Moscow and they let me into my room early and also let me switch to a road view. Smiles all around and always had time to give recommendations and good directions.  Roof top bar: My friends said people come from all around the city to have a drink.  It is easy to see why. Cleanliness:Towels, slippers, and bathrobe. Friendly room staff. *I would stay here again.* Negatives Smell: Continuous cigarette smoking.  Noise: I was on the 3rd floor and had little noise other than my neighbor who I believed lived in the hotel.;4
For all those people on here who have given this hotel a one star, I am amazed. Yes, its not fantastic, and yes the rooms aren't huge, but in general, the hotel was very clean and had all the amenities you need when your exploring an incredible city like New York.  It is a fairly lengthy walk from Midtown Manhattan and the main sites, but has a subway station on its doorstep where all trains, even express trains stop! (A cheap and extremely quick option)  There are also a zillion cabs roaring up and down Broadway 24-7 for the budding explorers.  I'm surprised its only rated as a 2*. I came back from NYC 3 days ago (10.2.04) and can honestly say that the hotel is basic, but fine with all the necessary amenities you need. (It also has in-room safety deposit boxes for extra;4
We stayed here for 2 nights in early December 2012 as a family of four, my daughters are 8 & 11. The area is typical Hollywood quite dirty, with most shops having roller doors etc. The hotel is clean, the room was quite large with two large beds but still room to walk around. The room had a fridge and microwave which is unusual for the US. We received breakfast in our rate which was of a good standard, it had cereals, toast, pastries and egg & waffle station also. The property had vending machines and a small convenience store, however, the gas station on the corner had everything you would need.  As Los Angeles is spread out you need to be able to get around and that's when this hotel is great, just down the corner is a metro station (Santa Monica & vermont). Which is part of;4
Great location for a renowned New York hotel that offers rooms, some of which have a beautiful view. Extra charges for internet access are very expensive and mandatory. Itâs not the best hotel in New York, but Iâll always remember it forever.;4
The suite was nice and clean.  The location very convenient to shopping, theater and restaurants.  The staff was friendly and efficient.;4
Nice clean hotel. Good size rooms, pretty little garden area with lights. Convenient location. Friendly staff at front desk. Breakfast could have been a little beter but I'm not sure if this has recently been upgraded. All in all great value for money....would definitely stay there again.;4
lovely hotel and great staff would have liked to have had a restaurant on site which would be great in the evening as the area the hotel is in lacks these ameneties also the bar has changed its design since we booked it was described as a speakeasy type bar but its now lacking in atmosphere and a comedy open mike is now the main attraction it was not brilliant;4
This hotel has a nice location in Manhattan and two diners/restaurants at the base. The room is relatively small, but to be expected in NYC. It's a bit dated, so it's not luxurious, but adequate for staying in a safe, nice place in NYC.;4
Booked for a second time as the hotel is close to main Broadway theatres and easy access to subway. Ideally situated for tourists. Staff helpful and courteous. Breakfast expensive considering no cooked items other than eggs.;4
Very good hotel in the centre of New York. Reception ok. Door men Jeff , Jamal and the rest were very helpful ! They arranged a lot for us and we could ask them anything. Also a great compliment for the cleaning service ! The beds and rooms looked every day like new ! Thanks from a happy family from Holland;4
Hotel was in good location. I did not have any issues with the area. 5 minute walk to the metro which was easy to get to most places. The buses were not the greatest and took ages! Staff were so helpful at giving you tips on places to go and how to get there. Nice little pool area and gym. Great for the price. Brilliant breakfast.;4
I stayed in this small hotel, with my adult son for three nights in May of 2012...the hotel is super convenient, out of the hustle and bustle of the downtown area...it is a great place if you are on a budget...you can get a cab to go anywhere...or take the subway...rooms are small, but adequate and the bathrooms are great...;4
Stayed here 7 nights back in 2014 - we flew end of September. Lovely Lobby area, quick check-in however the first room given to us was way too small, spoke to lady in front desk and they were more than happy relocate us to a bigger room. The room & bathroom was clean and provided basic amenities. Concierge were great, organised private transfer back to airport and always hailed down a taxi for us when we were heading out for a night out. Perfectly located, close to Penn station, Madison square garden, you could walk to time square and explore the city. The hotel has a decent diner, breakfast is decent.  Tip - although all the rooms had wifi, we found that the lobby had the fastest internet in the hotel.;4
After several months of reading reviews, we choice this hotel for its location and the price.  What a great place for two ladies to spend a week in Manhattan.   The staff was extremely helpful an accommodating.  Rooms were really small but equipped with all amenities needed to make an enjoyable stay.  Room 3506 was decorated nicely and in a quiet location of hotel.   Tick Tock restaurant was a great place to eat a quick bite or have a meal.  Good food. Hotel is on corner and the E train (express) is on corner right outside the hotel and local trains are across the street.  Macy's is one block away, Madison Square Gardens is across the street. CVS Pharmacy is right across street.   I would def recommend this hotel for a value, safe and great location. Hope to see you again soon!;4
This hotel needs modernisation, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller. The rooms are clean which is a plus. The staff are friendly but as with a lot of hotels in the USA there arenât many amenities. No room service, no coffee facilities . Itâs quite close to Time Square only a short walk which is good. If asked if I would come back to this hotel , I wouldnât!;4
I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel, the location is great near to everywhere ,the staff was very friendly and the room had a great view but a little small for 3 people.;4
Stayed here for 2-3 weeks around the Xmas period. Very good value and close to all amenities including the metro, supermarkets etc.  Hugo who is the cook downstairs during breakfast has fantastic customer service skills. Thanks for making the trip more enjoyable.   Would recommend this hotel and hope to be able to come back one day.;4
The price and location are very good. Few blocks away from Central Park. There's a subway station, 2 pharmacies, some breakfast places and restaurants near it. The room where I stayed was clean and comfortable. Wi-fi is better on the lobby, really unstable in the room. I had no problem with street noise and my room faced the 94th. The attendents were helpful when solicited.;4
We choose the 12th floor and LOVED it!    not the best looking room but it served its purpose, Very close to great food and subway also the beds are comfy :^)        Enjoy your stay        Willie;4
We were there for 5 nights.  Food in the Tik Tok Diner was very good, quickly served and the wait staff were very attentive.  Close to Penn Station and subways.  Only problem was that the one shower didnât have hot water.  We had two showers so I could use the other one.;4
For a hotel located in Manhattan, the Astor on the Park provides good value for the money. I stayed there for three nights with my girlfriend and we had no real problems. Our room was small but functional: Iâd say the size is on par with what youâd expect with a basic European pension. The room, the bedding, and the bathroom were all spotlessly clean, and I was quite impressed with the selection of free toiletries they provided. My only complaint is that the soundproofing between the rooms is not quite up to par. There was a group of rather rambunctious college kids staying down the hall from us on the first night of our stay, and their obnoxious behaviour kept us up well into the night until we both resorted to earplugs. Iâm happy to report that we didnât have any problems in;4
We arrived at about 11am and had to pay extra for early check in, the staff member made out like the room was being cleaned 'as we speak' which was clearly a lie. He had a bit of an attitude that did not sit well with me. When we got to the room there were rubbish that hadn't been cleaned. The room was outdated and our view was rubbish. But the hotel does have a great dinner buffet, which is worth trying. The swimming pool and jacuzzi was nice too, especially in the evening when there arent many people there. The great thing about this hotel is the locati on. It is 5mins away from City Walk and Universal Studios. It wasn't bad travelling to other places as we used Uber which was so much cheaper than a taxi - an hour journey to Santa Monica cost us about $10, we carpooled half;4
As a conference organizer we had six of our guests stay at Hollywood Hotel and the staff and manager Cecile couldn't have been better, more courteous and efficient. They met all our needs and more. Our guest praised the generous breakfast and good service. The free wifi access in the rooms was also most useful. Thank you all;4
We have frequent guests of the empire hotel both because of its location next to Lincoln center and its pet friendly policy. Itâs an older building so our expectations from our assigned are always thought of in that context. But this was the first time we took note of the quality of the furnishings. While the bed is wonderfully comfortable, the couch in our junior suite must be close to 25 years old. Itâs tired and saggy and truly in deplorable condition. One reason for getting a suite in the first place is to have some seating options other than the bed. This couch shouldâve been replaced years ago. Having said that, this is still one of our favorite UWS hotels.;4
Staying overnight, good room, very quiet and great bedding.  Bathroom a bit small, but functional. Great TV, HDMI input outlet easily accessible so able to use iPad to watch our own choice.  Bar nice, staff pleasant. Area around hotel very busy,not good for walking;4
The hotel was at a great location. The rooms were a little small but not unusual for the city. For the price that we paid, it was not bad. The staff were helpful and friendly and always eager to be of assistance.;4
My husband and I stayed here for two nights on the 14th and 15th.  We found a clean, spacious and comfortable room. We were on the 5th floor facing the pool with a nice view of the hills. Beds were very comfy.  I agree with other reviewers that the elevators were slow and not all of them appeared to work. Valet parking away convenient and quick.  I would recommend this hotel for those looking for a quiet, convenient location to most of the LA attractions like most of the studios, Hollywood Blvd and Sunset Strip, etc.  While we didn't visit the Universal Studios park or studio, we were pleasantly surprised to find the city walk a quick 10 mins with plenty of food options.;4
We stayed here as part of a quick getaway to the LA area.  We picked the hotel because it was walking distance to Universal, close to Warner Bros Studios and close to Hollywood Blvd.  We were here for 2 nights.  The service and friendly attitude of all the personnel was outstanding.  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  We had a corner room which was almost like a triangle shape.  It was nice and large and had a great view out towards the studios.  We knew about their elevator refurb but they had people at the elevators to help out.  The bed was comfortable the temperature control good.  We would stay here again.  If Universal or Warner Bros is your destination it doesn't get easier than this.  You can walk to Universal if you don't want to wait for the free shuttle.  We used Uber;4
Great value for money, the location is a bonus. Central Park is a short walk North, Times Square to the South, easy subway access to take you uptown or downtown.  Great choice of restaurants nearby. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Staff very friendly and helpful, especially Jeff at the front door and Alexis at reception. Will definitely stay here again.;4
"Staff was great, hotel and grounds are visually pleasing, and rooms are clean.  Wasn't sure what to expect from this hotel given it's right next to Universal Studios but it definitely exceeded expectations.  We stayed here one night because we had to attend a dinner in Hollywood.  Only took about ten minutes to get there so location is great as well.  A little tucked away and hard to find at first but a great find once you do.  We are planning to take our kids to Universal next year and will definitely stay here.  The only negative was that they don't police the hallways and we had several large and very loud groups of kids come in late at night. If it weren't for the lack of sleep caused by those groups, I'd probably go ahead and give it five stars (for the experience; not a";4
I love that the rooms still have a 1930's feel about them. We had 2 queen beds and a big thrill was to open what I thought was a closet door only to discover a 2nd full bathroom. I felt like we hit the jackpot. Where do you get a decently sized room with 2 bathrooms in NYC?  I guess we lucked out as only a few rooms have these. I think during renovations they made 2 small ensuite rooms into one. I'd give them 5/5 if they had a coffee maker in the room. There is a Starbucks and MacDonalds across the street but I like having my morning coffee immediately upon rising, while in pajamas. I'd definitely come back!;4
Great location- hotel is small, quiet, on the older side but is clean and reasonable and a good place to stay for business or pleasure. Across the street from Lincoln Center makes it a jem. Staff was pleasant. Lots of restaurants nearby.;4
When entering the Empire you are greeted with enthusiastic bellboy's & you are welcomed into the hotel with warmth. As you walk through the entrance you witness the coolest looking bar you've ever seen, it makes you want to sit, stay & get jolly with it's sophisticated feel. Literally the only downfall staying at Empire Hotel is that there is no free wifi in the rooms, but all you have to do is go down to the lobby & sit on the most comfortable couches in New York to experience it. Apart from that it was a massive & memorable part of our Trip to New York! The next time I visit I will 100% be booking again.;4
Have stayed here three times and every visit has been just fine. The rooms may not be huge, but they are very comfortable with nice bathrooms. The location is great--subway is about two blocks away and there are a lot of restuarants nearby. They also have some great deals on occasion--stayed once for about $80 a night.;4
"On the whole I have to give this a ""very good"".  Rooms are spacious for New York (although we did get an upgrade) the bathroom was tiny though, and very dated.  The heating took a while to master.  We ate breakfast daily in the diner downstairs, which was good.  Reception staff really pleasant and helpful.  Concierge and door staff were typical New Yorkers!";4
The Empire is attractive, with a very helpful staff and very well located if you are on the West Side.  I asked for a quiet room away from street noise and the very nice front desk clerk was able to accommodate me.;4
The hotel is stylish (a little too stylish if you ask me -- the patterns on wallpaper and carpet could make you dizzy)...the bar area is neat, my room was a decent size, and had a nice table to work at.  Great location especially if you have things to do in the Columbus Circle or Lincoln Center area.  Very close to subway.;4
My wife and I stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker in September 2015 for 4 nights.  The room was realtively small but what we were expecting.  It was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom had little accommodation for hanging items or setting anything down. The concierege was very friendly and helpful.  The location was ideal.  About the only complaint we had was there was no express checkout and there were too few staff to accommodate the number of people trying to check out at the same time.  That made for a bad memory to end the trip.;4
I've checked many hotels around Hollywood but I found Hollywood Hotel reasonably priced compared to others I viewed online.  I have no regrets, the place was very convenient,convenience stores nearby, 5 minute walk to the Metro rail just 4 stops to the Walk of Fame, 6 stops to Universal Studios.  Rooms are clean, comfy beds, friendly staff, good shower and aircon and great breakfast from friendly chef Hugo. can't ask for more.;4
Great hotel, and the perfect location! Right next to Madison Square Garden, and Times Square.   A lovely man called Muhammad checked us in, and looked after us so well. We were really impressed with the level of service.   Highly recommend if you are looking for a spot that feels close to everything!;4
If doing business or vacationing at Universal Studios or City Walk, no hotel is more convenient. Amenities are plentiful and in good condition. Good views from most rooms above 10th floor (Above 18th is great);4
The Empire Hotel is at 44 West 63rd Street which is close to Central Park, St Columbus Circle, the Museum Mile, and the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, and the Lincoln Centre - they are all very close. There are also good eateries nearby, the subway is close, and via subway Times Square is only about 5 minutes away, or you can walk it but it will take 30 minutes. The staff are very helpful. We did have an issue initially when we found our room was not suited to our particular circumstances but the hotel staff (in particular Daria at Reception), went the extra mile to get things sorted. We were very happy with the arrangements she worked out. We also found the door staff to be always helpful and happy - Dennis comes to mind as having helped us several times.  We;4
We enjoyed our stay at Ameritania in the month july 2017. The staff was very accurate & friendly, especially Said & Mathieu. The suites were very comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect: nearby Central Park and Tomes Square ans a few minutes walk from the metro. Only breakfast can be improved (wider range (pancakes, ommelets etc) and no plastic cutlery and breakfast plate);4
"Before I booked this time, I phoned to make sure they hadn't destroyed the old loveliness by renovating the life out of it! (maybe a bit worn, but I like that in an old hotel!) I was assured the green marble was still in place and the open-air courtyard still existed (a welcoming, outdoor lounge area where you can relax and chat) and the wonderful breakfasts were still included. I named the omelet chef ""Dances with Eggs"". This place is a treasure. Walking distance to catch the train to the Chinese theatre and anywhere else you want to go. Elias was particularly helpful in tracking down some clothes that I had left at our last hotel the night before. Thanks, Elias!";4
I researched a lot of hotels before coming and luckily found this! The price was right/affordable with 2 queen beds and my AARP card--which allowed it to be cancelled with a refund if needed b/c I booked directly with them rather than a discount site-and my price was better! The hotel has and is being renovated. Mohamed checked us in, was extremely helpful and pleasant. We got a 35th floor room with a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building! We slept with the curtains open just to see it lit up so beautifully at night! The room and bathroom were both very clean, linens, carpet and furniture in great condition. The staff were unbelievably nice, polite, and eager to help. The Lobby had plenty of staff on hand to assist you, the concierge was very knowledgeable about Broadway;4
The free breakfast, with order-made omelets, waffles, cereal, bagels, fruit, etc., was one of the best I've had in a less-than-sumptuous hotel.  The free wi-fi, proximity to a metro station (Vermont/Santa Monica) and the Hollywood Freeway are other plusses.  Our room (including bathroom) was clean and comfortable. The front desk staff, especially Michael, was helpful and friendly.  I asked for an especially quiet room, and the staff went to some trouble to make sure I got one.  A plumbing problem was fixed quickly.  The fitness center is well equipped.  The immediate neighborhood is uninteresting, but Los Feliz, Hollywood, and other more interesting areas are easy to get to from here.  All in all, a good value.;4
Very clean warm room. Pleasant Brasserie restaurant and bar attached. Small room with small Kingsize bed, adequate bathroom and room facilities ie iron/board, hairdryer. No tea/coffee making facilities. Central location brilliant with helpful Concierge.;4
We stayed at this Hilton for 2 nights while visiting family in the area. The location near the highway was very convenient especially given that you didn't hear any traffic noise on the property. Our room was a good size, updated, and clean. The pool, which is heated, was lovely and well landscaped. It was great to have access to a printer to take care of boarding passes and the little in house store was well stocked. We will definitely stay here when in the area again.;4
Rooms are cozy and well-kept. Restaurant service and quality is fantastic (special thanks to Hugo and Fanny). Regarding the restaurant area, it could do with some refurbishing: less carpeting, a little update on the ceilings, etc. Great place overall.;4
Visited New York for four days and stayed again at the Empire.  Still a great place in a great location.  The rooms didn't get bigger--didn't think they would.  Everyone helpful and friendly. My only question to this hotel and every hotel is why do you charge so much for stuff from the refrigerator.  Water is over $8 a bottle.  Downstairs in the Dwayne Reed it is under $2 for the same bottle.  Same thing with the candy and the booze.  Has anyone every done a study about lower prices with slower profits being larger profits at the end of the year?  The for purchase movies on the TV were a fair value.   $13 for the two of us.  In New York City senior movie prices are 10.50 or 11.50 each.  So on this the hotel was a better value.;4
Awesome location, nice room pretty small but hey this is NYC who wants to stay in your room anyway! I was a little disappointed in the view from my room as I had an interior air shaft view, other than that everything was awesome.;4
Hey having a great time in the hotel,  great rooms great views,  even extended my stay,  staff are doing a great job helping the front line staff, close to everything, I can even see the Empire State Building from my room.;4
Great location for Lincoln Center and Central Park.  There are several reasonable restaurants nearby, including Ed's Chowder House. Helpful staff especially the doormen. Very easy to get taxis here. Lobby can be really loud.;4
You will be hard pressed to find a smaller room than in The Jane. So why four points? First of all, you get what you pay for. What else should you expect at this central location for this price? But then there is more, it's realy clean, there are little things like free water and slippers, and best of all everyone is really friendly. Just don't plan to hang around in your room, it is strictly sleeping only. However the cafe is worth a visit even when you are not staying overnight.;4
The hotel is conveniently located near Penn Station, it's less than a 5 minute walk. Mohamed offered excellent customer service and allowed us to do an early check in. Our room had a Beautiful view. The room was small but we just needed somewhere to shower and sleep after doing a day trip, room was clean and checkout was quick. I would highly recommend.;4
Air conditioning left much to be desired. Large roach in the bathroom. Decor is a bit odd, a bit art deco/arvant guarde. Nice staff! Comfort was fairly good. Good location. A bit pricey for what I recieved, but I'd certainly consider staying again.;4
Business trip to Lincoln Center - great location nice common space. Reasonable  but smallish room. Clean - very nice staff.  There is so much potential for access from this location and nearby shopping is great.;4
The Jane is a beautiful boutique hotel and we loved our stay there! Everything about this place screams history. We stayed in a Captain's room and it was perfect for my husband and me. Private bathroom, and beautiful and clean room. The only negative thing about our stay here was the smell in the elevator and the hallway. Both were very different smells and both were awful. As we got off the elevator and walked down the hall to our room, I was terrified of what our room would smell like, but thankfully he smells were only in the elevator and hallway. Other than that, this place is great and we would definitely stay here again. Gorgeous neighborhood, especially in December.;4
Stayed here for a couple of nights when starting our trip up the West Coast.  Easy access to Universal on their shuttle bus. Ten minute walk to train station for easy access to other areas. Hotel rooms comfortable free wi fi in the foyet.  I would recommend  this hotel.;4
Stayed 14 nights in New Yorker, in a 'NY Queen Suite' - that was upgraded to a 'NY Queen Suite View'. Overlooked the Hudson river and New Jersey. Suite are spacious, well maintained and heaps of storage space. Bed very comfortable and room quiet. Tick Tock diner very handy for late night snacks. Very good service. One night a party continued to 2am. Rang Concierge and he shut it down immediately. Also the Information Desk very friendly and helpful. Only downside was I considered the Bathroom small because of a shelf overhanging basin. Great location. All favourites within 15 mins walk, Madison Sq Grdn 3 mins walk and subway stations at the corners of hotel.;4
This was my first stay at the New Yorker and overall my party was pleased. We had 2 double rooms. The bedding area was spacious, the bathroom had only a shower with limited counter space. The sink drained a little slow but the shower had good pressure and was nice. Wifi was decent and about what you would expect at NYC hotels. This is an older building, probably built in the 30s, but our rooms were updated and larger than the newer hotels. I have stayed in newer places but felt I was in a large closet but not the case here. Would stay here again if the price is right.  Also, want to say that Mohammed was very helpful and did his best to meet our needs.;4
We stayed here for 5 nights and can't really fault it. The hotel was lovely and the staff were all very friendly & helpful.   The rooms are compact but have everything you need. There's a dinner for breakfast although we'd recommend heading out and about. The restaurant is really nice & well worth a visit.   Location wise you could be much more central and with Penn station right next doors it's so easy to get everywhere.   Make sure take some comfy shoes!;4
There are so many places to stay in the city.  We were very pleased with this Rid.  it is a walk from the main tourist areas but this gives you an opportunity to see the real Marrakech.   The staff are very focused on  your needs and safety and you are given a mobile phone and they tell you to ring if you get lost.  For us getting a little bit lost was part of the  fun and we never felt unsafe but it is good they are willing to come and find you.  The staff are all very helpful.  Our room was fine and the roof terrace was wonderful away from the busy world of the city with free drinks ( non alcoholic) all day and they remember what you like.  The only minor negative comment i would make is do not rely on the staff for recommendaitons re restauraurants etc.  The Italian girls;4
This location was great for visiting all of midtown. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in 30 minutes or less. Its worth it to pay for the upgraded rooms on the higher levels with views of Empire state building.  A couple issues were service was spotty from the front desk. Misinformed and lied to on multiple occasions. That was made up for by the superb management who did everything in there power to make it right.;4
If you're going to any event at Lincoln Center, this is where you want to stay.  It is literally steps away.  The hotel is very nice, great access to restaurants (inside and out)/shopping/local attractions and staff is friendly and accommodating.;4
"Astor on the Park was a great place to stay for people visiting the city. It is cheaply priced for NYC, located across from the NW side of Central Park in a safe neighborhood, and was generally everything you would want for a stay. The bedroom and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfortable, and the accommodations were ""European"": very compact and just what a person or couple needs to shower, sleep, and dress for touring. It is not luxury, but if your luggage remains in a hotel room all day while you are out exploring this is the place for you. Very quiet and located 3.5 blocks from a subway station. I thoroughly enjoyed staying here for my first NYC visit. The front desk staff is a little cold, but the cleaning service through the day was great.";4
Our family stayed here for one night recently while visiting Columbia, and I would book this again for another NYC trip. It is a bit older/worn, but clean (at least our room & bathroom were), and they are in the process of some renovations as evidenced by the construction workers & debris going in & out of the hotel. The location is great-- just around the corner from a subway stop on the red (local) line, so easy to get just about anywhere. No parking, but there's a nearby garage (added cost)--we were able to find street parking in our block, so parked for free. Added bonus: a little corner cafe on the same block, with yummy bagels & a variety of breakfast items-- did not eat there for other meals, so cannot comment on those. No problem with noise & comfy beds made for a great;4
We decided to visit Universal Studios and was pleasantly surprised to book the Hilton. It is right on the same property across the way from Universal Studios and has a free shuttle ride to and from the amusement park. We stayed for two nights and thought the hotel was good. Pleasant hotel staff, very helpful. The walls are a bit thin though. The guests in the next room were so loud into the wee hours of the night, but I don't fault the hotel for this. There is a daily fee for parking. You get a free continental breakfast but it just consists of yogurt, fruit, muffin, and a croissant and drink. They do have a full buffet of breakfast if you want to pay $9.00. Other than that, I found it to be a great hotel. Everyone was friendly and nice. I would definitely stay here again.;4
First impression as we arrived in our Uber car was that we had picked a good location to stay in. Obviously there is a refurbishment going on. The young men on the desk were so friendly and gave us great ideas for eating out. Our room was spacious and quiet. We loved the free entertainment in the bar each night- our first experience of stand up comedy and was the highlight of our stay there. Breakfasts could have been better, few staff, and they ran out of things like green tea and tables were not cleared very promptly. So need to get the restaurant up to scratch. Bar snacks would be good too. The pool needs some extras like snacks and bar service. Price was good for our stay there and we would stay there again!;4
Great location by the Lincoln Center. Starbucks nearby and the Chowder House next door is excellent. The room was except for a bit musty and damp floor next to the cooler but it was in the middle of a heat wave. Beds and linens are lovely. I'd stay here again. Great deal on travel zoo. Easy subway access.;4
"My son and I stayed for four nights, visiting NYC as tourists. We were looking for a budget hotel that had beds, shower, internet connection and was reasonably well placed. This fitted well; the beds were fine, it was clean, the staff friendly, across the road from the northern end of Central Park and in a nice neighbourhood. It's a pretty basic hotel - you pay $25 for three days' internet (good connection speed but didn't watch movies so I don't know), they tell you where to take laundry (unattended service is available), the rooms are in need of a refresh, but it's well placed, functional and for NYC prices (especially given how central it is), quite reasonable. Would go back again. Also, we got a balcony which was a pleasant surprise (I think we got lucky). Only real";4
We came to this hotel at 9am on Tuesday morning and Reception tried to accommodate us immediately, despite check-in being 3pm. As they had no availability, they took our bags in to safe storage and couldn't have been more helpful.We stayed here for two nights midweek and had a lovely large room, two double beds and a nice clean bathroom. It was great value at a great location (literally around the corner from Line 1 subway) - I would highly recommend it if you're in NYC for a few days on a sightseeing / shopping trip.;4
Very good hotel, close to everything. Has restaurants to eat and bar to grab drinks. Great 24hr diner.Right in the middle of Times Square. Perfect for Broadway shows 1 block away. Close to shopping. Not far from  Central Park;4
A basic but pleasant hotel, well located next to Central Park, nearby Natural History Museum. (Seems to be far from city centre, but you can easily get there taking the subway, two blocks ahead).The rooms are tiny, but very clean (very comfortable bed), with a nice bathroom,The staff is very friendly and helpful.Nice stay for low prices. Internet access (from the hotel computer only) and coffee/snacks machines in the  basement foor. Recommended.;4
Room was a good size for a Times Sq hotel, clean and nicely laid out.  Lobby with fireplace was cozy.  Really, really convenient location steps to theaters and restaurants.  Street construction outside was a bit noisy though.  Staff was friendly, courteous and efficient.;4
We stayed at this hotel in July 2010. It was our first time in NYC. Rooms are of a good size for a New York hotel. Bathroom is small but clean. Overall experience was excellent. Great location. Pool is very small so this was a disappointment but the view is so great that we made fun of the situation. The hotel is close to the subway station which was convenient for us.;4
This is a great place to stay and very conveniently located.  There is a subway station right next to the hotel and is walking distance to practically everything including Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Empire State Building, the new High Line Park, Rockefeller Center to name a few, and there are plenty of places to eat nearby.  There is a bakery just down the block called Angelina's which is FANTASTIC, a CVS next door, plus a liquor store, McDonalds and Starbucks across the street.   The Tik Tok Diner in the hotel is a great place to eat.  The hotel retains its original character and it's well worth the time to go downstairs and read all about it's history and the people who have stayed there.  It is a great value! We have stayed here twice now, once just overnight on our;4
I chose this hotel due to its location and the expected standard of accommodation.   I was attending a conference in the Queen Elizabeth Conference centre and need a hotel within walking distance at a reasonable cost. .;4
This hotel is opposite central park and subway into the centre only 3 blocks away. Me and my friend stayed here. Clean, own bathroom, room small but we didn't spend much time there, just somewhere to sleep and wash. Hotel staff very helpful, we booked our sightseeing bus tour at hotel. Great little diner about 2 blocks away recommended by hotel and they even booked our cab back to airport, which was the same price as yellow cab but a licoln car, looked liked a limo. Price was good and couldn't fault this place. Definately recommend to others.;4
The people here are great really helpful. The location is within walking distance of universal cityâs front gate and city walk. The hotel is nice and clean the corner room we had with a king was spacious.  When we had trouble getting hot water in the shower the staff took care of it right away and discounted our stay. Iâd definitely stay again.;4
I stayed at Empire Hotel for a midweek overnight stay in NYC.  I got to the hotel around 10:30pm and the check in was quick and easy.  Since I booked through tripadvisor they gave me a complementary upgrade!  AMAZING.  (Many thanks to Zunachy and Simon)  The room was large (despite what I had read in other reviews) - it had two small rooms and a bathroom.  If needed, they had everything from a keurig machine/cups to cell phone chargers available for purchase in the room.  The room had a flat screen TV, two queen beds, a couch, sitting chairs and a coffee table.  A very pretty single flower in a vase sat on the night stand.  The bathroom, while small, was modern and clean - personally, I'd take it over the typical hotel bathrooms I've seen.  It looked recently renovated and the;4
"The Universal Hilton at the edge of the Universal Studios offers a very comfortable stay. The ""king corner"" rooms are extremely spacious with good to great views and over-sized bathrooms, comfortable king beds, with good work desks, large couches, refrigerators and good ambience. Standard rooms are comfortable and good sized. Mattresses are firm, linens good, and staff service is good. The pool area is very attractive. This is a good business hotel for meetings and conferences and also offers a great Hollywood-area location for family vacations. Hotel borders the Universal City Walk with a wide range of restaurants and attractions, and which some decades ago was where Westerns like TV's ""The Virginian"" were filmed.";4
Enjoyed our stay! Quiet & comfortable. Great view of city lights & universal studios. Enjoyed looking out the window at the Harry Potter castle! Large room and bath. Peter Roth bath amenities . Only downside was high cost of food in the cafe or also pricey room service. Citywalk is only an 8 min leisure walk plus a shuttle is available- may restaurants there!!!;4
Spent 4 nights in a newly refurbished room 2 adults and 2 children who both have hidden disabilities.  First night the bath leaked we had to mop up the bathroom with towels. Next morning spoke to reception and they were going to fix. Second night bath was fixed but toilet would not flush went to tell Recepion this was 7pm was told hotel was fully booked so moving room was not an option and they would contact maintance. 30 minutes later came to the door and the maintanceteam had left and options were to stay in room or there was a room available we could move to. They would also refund 2 breakfast. We decided to move as no toilet til morning  with 4 of us and children with needs. The 2nd room was so much better bigger and better views. No issues with second room. Since coming;4
I stayed there for an incredible weekend, very cozy place!  loved it!. My room was super clean and tidy.  The team is very dedicate. The decor is impeccable, with great taste, i will return to other opurtunities.;4
The Empire is across the street from the Met where we went to the Baron Fund Conference on the 25th.  The hotel room was small but the convenience was great, because it was so close. The staff were exceptional from the time we checked in with Emir who was very helpful, polite and patient, to the rooftop bar staff who were exceptionally in their service. Canât leave out Ray whose friendliness and sense of humor made us all laugh.;4
A really good location and some great views from my 23rd floor room! I was commuting from Manhattan to Newark each day and, with the hotel being a 2 minute walk to Penn station, it was the perfect spot.  Additionally, itâs close to lots of shopping, within 10 minutes of Time Square and a short subway ride into downtown.  Only slight reservation of the hotel would be that the rooms are a bit small and I would have appreciated a small fridge in the room for my water.;4
I need a relatively inexpensive last minute place to stay in the general area of this hotel definitely fit the bill. It's just a few blocks from a subway stop and there are plenty of stores and places to eat outside. My room and bathroom were perfectly fine and I slept well both nights I was there. Two things that bothered me-the TV didn't get that many channels, and the elevators were ridiculously slow some of the time, sometimes causing a bit of a backup. The interior of the floor I was on also wasn't the best. But all in all, the place was a good find.;4
Hotel is clean and friendly and in a great location in NYC right across from Lincoln Center.  We had a Jr Suite....so we had alittle extra room.  Hotel rooms in NYC are small,  the extra money for the room was worth it.;4
Perfect hotel for those wanting a great location for exploring London (100 metres to the London eye and sealife centre). We hardly spent any time in the hotel but the room was comfortable and spacious and had everything we needed except a fridge which would have been really useful as we had a 2 year old with us. Breakfast was good, exactly what you would expect and enough choices for what you are after, very well priced as well, the fact kids eat free was a bonus. We have already said we would use the hotel again the next time we go to London for a short break as when you look at price and location it is a great option. Would have given 5 stars overall if there had been a fridge in the room ðð;4
Great hotel in fabulous location.  All the staff were lovely and so helpful.  We were upgraded and had a lovely room with great views.  Would definitely recommend.  Tick Tock diner adjoining is also great with excellent service.;4
"For those traveling with a dog this really is the best place to stay. They have a dedicated area for dogs to potty that is kept immaculately clean, plus a âJog a Dog Treadmillâ to keep your dog(s) is top condition. The hotel is central to shopping & dining, or if you just donât feel up to leaving a 2; hr diner is conveniently located within the hotel. The staff are courteous, kind & accommodating to ensure your stay is perfect. I had a great corner room with a view, I couldnât have been more comfortable. This is my 2nd time staying here and it wonât be my last.";4
Stayed here for 6 nights, 3 adults sharing a twin room. Easily enough space to accommodate us all. Check-in was swift and desk staff were really pleasant and helpful. The Art Deco finish is a really pleasant change to most modern hotels where everything is the same, the attention to detail here is fabulous, even down to the bathroom fixtures and fittings. This iconic hotel's location is very good, close to Penn Station, Empire State Building and even Times Square is only a 10 minute stroll away. The local tour buses all stop outside the hotel so it's easy to get to other parts of Manhattan. Tick Tock Diner is convenient when you've had a busy day and want something informal. Portions are huge. Bianca Trattoria is more formal but is still relaxed however it is considerably more;4
Clean hotel located between Times Square and the south end of Central Park. We traveled with 4 children under 14 and requested a rollaway bed when we booked using Hotels.com. There was no indication that it would be an issue. When we got to the hotel I called for the bed and was told our room was too small and it was a fire hazard. Obviously had I known, I would have booked somewhere else with more room/beds. After a few minutes, they remedied the situation by providing us a mattress, sheets, etc. that we just plopped on the floor. They were quick to solve and sympathetic to my situation. I'm really pleased and look forward to another stay with them.;4
My highest praise for this hotel is its security. I had returned to my room just as the cleaning woman had finished with it so the door was still open. She saw me coming and told me she was done so I just walked right into my open room. I had barely set my belongings down when she came in and asked to see my key so she could verify that it actually opened my room. It hadn't even crossed my mind that she hadn't initially checked that it was in fact my room. I was pleasantly surprised.  They have a great breakfast buffet. There is a lot to choose from! There was an omelette bar, Asian choices, all the dishes you would expect from a continental breakfast. I didn't try anything else in the hotel, but it seemed like it had quite a few dining options. I saw another sit-down eating;4
The New Yorker is a very nice hotel that is centrally located.  The rooms were nice and clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We stayed in the King Suite which was perfect for my family of four.  We had to switch hotels after our first night there because our first hotel was horrible (Hotel Pennsylvania).  The reservation staff was very helpful (at 2 am I might add) in helping us to get last minute reservations and a room with a discount.  The front desk staff were extremely friendly and efficient.  No lines at the front desk.;4
We booked on line because of the reasonable prices, and found the room and common areas to be clean and neat.   This hotel is conveient to the things we wanted to explore. We would recommend this hotel to friends.;4
Itâs not a glitzing hotel, the rooms are basic but clean, the plumbing is noisy but hey your on holiday, not in the room for long.  Everyone is so friendly from  check in to the staff constantly cleaning....we were there at the start of corona virus!  Very central for getting anywhere great door men!;4
The purpose of our stay was to experience Christmas in NYC. This hotel is in a great location. Close to everything we did. The room was very small and no view at all. I think it was because we booked through a 3rd party site. The staff was very pleasant and helpful.;4
Nice cozy room,just steps from subway and few blocks from the park.;4
"Stayed here on a Thursday night using my Hilton Points for a room. I had a room with two doubles on the ""executive (towers) floor"". Stayed on the 21 st floor of the 24 story hotel. The hotel is right next to Universal Studios and Citywalk. A free shuttle will take you there but it is a very short walk. The rooms were nice with a large bathroom. The executive floor lounge has a nice view of LA and ok PM snacks and an ok cold breakfast. I wish I had more time to check out the hotel's rest.  They appeared to have a large buffet in the evening and looked very good. The front desk staff was not very nice and when I requested a rollaway (my two kids did not want to share a bed) they told me it would be an extra $35.00! Oh well, I agreed to it. We returned from dinner three hours later";4
I booked this place last minute and was delighted with this place. It is so quirky. I was in a single room and it is exactly like a ship cabin but with a flat screen tv included.   The bathrooms are shared on the floor I was staying on. They are clean and they had a fantastic shower. It didn't bother me at all to share them. It was like a super posh hostel but with your own private space.  The concierge and desk staff are also very helpful. There is loads to see and do in the area and the High Line is right behind the hotel.   The only disadvantage that I found was that it is a few blocks away from public transport. The hotel is located at the very end of Jane street and I wasn't comfortable walking down there on my own at night time but that was a personal choice as I was;4
For NY hotels, this hotel was priced well.Had good service from needing a shower cap to in-room coffee maker.The Tick Tock Diner was an added plus with good food at reasonable prices.Cleaning staff always smiling & efficient.Helpful staff to help with loading luggage into van upon leaving.Convenient to subway.I enjoyed reading the history located on the basement level.;4
We stayed only one night in this beautiful hotel after a week's stay in Burbank visiting family. We chose this hotel for our last night in LA to be able to make our very early flight the next morning. It's a big, beautiful hotel and was very nicely decorated for Christmas. Our standard room was very clean & inviting. Even though we were beside busy LAX we did not hear any noise in our room. Check in was very smooth & check out the next morning was very quick even if it was Saturday at 5:00 am! And the free airport shuttle was there to take us to the airport in plenty of time for our flight! The shuttle driver was very polite & helpful with our bags. Our thanks to all at this hotel! We would gladly stay here again the next time we visit LA.;4
The hotel is across one street from Lincoln Center.  It is great to walk out of the opera or symphony and into the hotel. Everything looks nice, the staff are  very helpful. It seems odd that the sink drain did not open and the shower stall had only half a door.;4
"I traveled to NYC for business, and stayed here for one night.  I selected this hotel solely based on proximity to my business meeting, figuring I could manage just about anything for one night.  First, the good.  I was greeted upon check-in by Helena, who was very friendly and helpful.  I was upgraded to a junior suite (I had a king room reserved; the jr suite adds a couch, chair, and coffee table), which I'm glad for, as I can't imagine what the size of a regular room would be given how small the junior suite was - but of course, small room size isn't a big surprise given the nature of the hotel.  (The bathroom was also on the small size but very managable.)  More plusses: the bed was very comfortable, and the shower had an overhead rain shower head with handheld attachment";4
This was our first visit to this hotel. My husband myself, and 2 children traveling. Front desk check in could have been more efficient and we waited in line for a while. When we finally got our room, we werecommend pleasantly surprised. Clean, roomy, and updated. We had the most amazing view of Universal Studios! This view made up for the fact the elevators were being renovated so we often had long wait to times to get up and down from room. When renovationshe are final it will be great. Walking distance to Universal so we didn't utilize the shuttle. Breakfast was delicious, but a bit spendy each morning.  I would recommend this hotel for families visiting Universal and would definitely stay again!;4
The the rooms were clean and spacious but a bit outdated, could do with some refurbishment with new carpets and colours, but overall it was a great experience. We had a room with view of the Hills which wasn't very pretty but we didn't spend much time in our room, so it didn't bother me too much.  It took us about 45mins to get to the hotel and a $90 taxi fare, but once we were there, everything else was very conveniently located. Only about 15mins to downtown Los Angeles, all tour buses pass by the hotel and Universal Studios is next door!  The staff were all very friendly and courteous, I couldn't fault their service. Check-in was fast and efficient. They even gave us a room before normal check-in time. We used the travel desk service and they were super efficient. The;4
My husband an I read a lot of hotel reviews before we booked this hotel. The price was reasonable, and Days Inn is a chain, so we felt safe with the name. The staff was friendly. I called the front desk and asked if they had a vending machine (they had 2) but the guy recommended going to the little store on the corner because the prices were comparable and the selection was better.   We got a room with a double bed. It was very huge, almost filled the whole room. There was also an armoire with a TV, a desk and a fridge. If you had large luggage and wanted to spread out. then I can imagine it would be cramped. But for the two of us it was perfect. The bathroom was clean and stocked. But, it kind of smelled like curry and I thought the towels smelled smoky (but my husband didn't;4
The location of this hotel is great. For new york city its perfect. There is a 24hr diner next door and a subway station too. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped. I would definitely stop here again.;4
This hostel came surprisingly updated. The floors looked brand new, the bathrooms were very clean and nice, the building was very secure, and the location was awesome. The only downside is that you have to pay for the internet. It was not too big of a deal, but an extra cost that we didn't expect. Overall, a good stay.;4
My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker for 4 days. We picked it based upon location. If you want walk and be close to it all this the location!!   Check in was quick and easy. The rooms are tiny and dated. I'm not sure if all the rooms are like that or if some have been renovated. I would ask next time when booking. The bathroom is also tiny and needs to be updated but I have to say everything was super clean.   We would probably return as you can't beat this location!;4
We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were very surprised when we received a complimentary basket of fresh fruit on our first night. The room was large and the bedding plush. The hotel is close to the Metro Red Line which took us directly to downtown Hollywood. The only down side to our stay was that the double beds are a tad small if you are a big person.;4
Stayed here from 9th April to 15th April. Nice hotel in a good location. Rooms a bit on the small side but adequate enough as only spent very little time in them. The security guys can be a bit intimidating when you want to go back to your room but just show your key card and the reception area gets very busy at times. We ate next door in Tick Tocks a few times which also gets busy at times too. All in all a good base for spending a week in New York.;4
I spend a lot of time in NYC and this hotel exceeded my expectations. Location was terrific, staff courteous and helpful. I will definitely return. Be certain to check out the rooftop views - I didn't catch them until I was checking out. Don't forget your bathing suit in the summer - pool is small but fun!;4
The Empire is a stylishly decorated hotel with a friendly and welcoming staff. Rooms are a reasonable size for NYC and clean. The bathroom in our double bed room was very small, which was not a problem for me, but something to take into consideration if it's important to you.  The location of the hotel is safe and relatively quiet, and is convenient for guests visiting Lincoln Center (right across the street) or Central Park. It has great access to the subway for visits to other parts of Manhattan, especially destinations on the Upper West Side, like The Cloisters, the Museum of Natural History, and Columbia University. The area around nearby Columbus Circle has shopping, restaurants, and a busy Whole Foods (good option for breakfast.)   The only thing that marred our stay at;4
On arrival we were presented with a facilities bill for $88 + 8.5% tax. Receptionist advised that this was for use of Hi Fi, Gym, Free telephone calls. I advised  that at 70yrs of age neither myself or wife would be using Gym nor Wi Fi nor making any telephone calls. She said she could not waive the fee but she could reduce reduce it to $44 + Tax which I consider a rip off! Never had a hotel charge for these facilities before not even Hilton Paddington or Thistle Group etc. I notice this has been raised in other reviews and still Wyndham still persist in this fee. Otherwise the hotel is excellent for the costs. It is central to most attractions etc. The rooms are spotless - our bathroom appears to have been renovated over the last few years. The hotel decor is Art Deco in line;4
Husband and I booked here for our anniversary trip to NYC because it was affordable and I wanted to stay in Times Square.  We did arrive in NYC before check-in time so we just left our bags with the hotel and we were off to start our adventure. It couldn't have been more easy and they didn't even charge us for leaving the bags as I KNOW some other hotels in NYC do. Just a couple bucks as a tip.  When we came back about 330, room was ready and bonus! we got a room upgrade for our anniversary! The room was huge! It had a living room area with a couch and TV and a huge king size bed! We were very happy with the room. We also got a nice note from the front desk manager and a bottle of wine. Also, even though we were close to the street, we were never once woken up by the city noise.;4
I stayed here for 17 nights in July 2010... yes a little too 'Alan Partridge' (the brits will get it) for my liking.  The hotel is very good, some great service (Stewart on the front desk was particularly attentive and helpful). My room was a King Alcove, very roomy with a comfortable bed, great view (see photo) and a good bathroom. I worked in my room for much of the time, so started to get sick of it, but all in all it was very good. The TV was a quite old 4:3 CRT but  worked fine and provided a decent range of channels... fine by me.  My room was on the Universal studios side of the building, which gets sun in the morning.. the rooms on the other side got the sun all afternoon and can become a bit warm (one of my colleagues found the AC in his room on the other side had;4
Great location, great staff and super clean. Nice rooms although a bit small, especially the bathroom. They should have informed us that the room had no view: we had great expectations and we were disappointed. Overall good, though.;4
Except for 2 days without hot water, except for the problems with elevators, except for the noisy neighbours, everything was good. Miss Zunachy and miss Minerva were very helpfull and kind and help us with some inconvenients.;4
After reading a number of bad reviews about this hotel, we were a little dubious about staying here, but all those reveiws were nothing like what we got. We arrived five hours early and still able to check into our room straight away! Everything was clean and the room was lovely. Provided with a fridge wihich helped to store drinks, as well as a microwave and tea and coffee facilities.  The hotel is in a great location, altough there isnt much around the actual hotel except for a few food places such as subway, pizza hut etc the metro station is less then a 5 minute walk and we used this with ease everyday for only $5 for an unlimited day pass on the trains and buses. Also an internet cafe across the street for only $3 an hour. I woudnt say the area is dangerous, always felt;4
Myself and partner have just come back from a one week stay at The New Yorker. We had an amazing time exploring the city!   The New Yorker is in a great location if you are looking to do a city break. Most attractions are within walking distance such as Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, Times Square, 5th Avenue for Shopping and The High Line / The Vessel. If you didnât want to walk or you wanted to visit attractions slightly further away then conveniently Penn Station is right next door to the hotel to catch the subway to where youâd like to go and failing that, you can always flag down a taxi... There are plenty of those!   We arrived at the hotel slightly earlier than our check in time (4pm) so I was expecting that we would have to hang around for a while before;4
Lovely hotel, fantastic service and friendly staff, clean rooms, super comfy beds, USB charger in room, breakfast had great choices and well cooked, fair price, Wi-Fi good, Great location, close to main attractions,;4
Room was smaller than motels outside of the city, but very conveniently located and the view was great. Clean, comfortable and restful after a full day.  Quiet with nice ambiance, guest orientated and very safe. Would stay again.;4
Great location good clean rooms really comfy beds need after twelve hours on your feet!  Good choice of breakfast in the adjoining tick tick diner would stay here again if I was lucky enough to Very central for The sights and the Subway;4
During a girls' week away in New York, we stayed at the Empire Hotel. We were very impresses with our first impression of the hotel. During check in the receptionist recommended we take a junior suite instead of our queen size bed room. We agreed under the impression that the room had both a queen size bed and a pull out couch. The room had only a pull out couch. After calling down to the front desk we were advised to try it for the night. It was a very uncomfortable and sleepless night for my girlfriend and I. The pull out couch was very uncomfortable. The hotel did redeem itself because after asking for our original reservation of a queen size room we were given a small suite with two double beds. After that first night our experience at the hotel was good but I ask myself why;4
Quick Overview Pros: Extremely quiet rooms and recently renovated Cons: Only decaf coffee stocked in room but housekeeping brought me regular after a call  Spent one night here between flights at LAX. We could not have been happier with this hotel from the quick complimentary shuttle to the recently renovated (beautiful) lobby, to the incredibly quiet rooms. Despite being located on the airport side of the hotel, we couldn't hear a single plane from our room. Our standard room was perfectly fine although they did not have a proper desk or office chair to work from.  Although we did not visit the restaurant, we did stop by the bar for a quick bite. Drinks were good but our cheese dip was terribly greasy. Our breakfast in the morning was much better, though! We got a couple of;4
Booked the basic room for a three night stay.   Rooms were very small, as expected, but clean and comfortable. Bed and linens were very nice.   Bathroom was pretty small but adequate.  The hotel itself was very nice ,  check in quick, staff very polite and friendly.  Convenient to two subway lines, so it was easy to commute.  Would recommend;4
This hotel is clean, modernized, convenient.  They have a parking arrangement with reduced fees at a lot several blocks away.  Two of their four elevators are currently not operational, so it can be slow to ride up and down.....and crowded!  Other than that, it's very good.;4
Stayed at the Empire for 4 nights. Great location near the lincoln center if you have anything going on there. We did go to the bar on roof top which was nice fun spot to overlook city buildings. We didn't utilize the restaurant. My husband used the gym which was tiny and in the basement, sufficient if you want to get a free work out in, but not sure if you'd feel comfortable there by yourself.Our room was small but probably like most other NYC hotel rooms, bathroom very small . Had some issues with A/C but as soon as we told the front desk they sent someone up right away and fixed it immediately, wished we had mentioned it sooner, they were very responsive. The front desk staff was very friendly when we checked in and the valet were very helpful and nice as well.All in all for;4
This hotel was great - clean and close to all the attractions. Red line metro is located two blocks away.. You can park for $25 a day. Complementary breakfast is really good. Eggs are made fresh per order.. The cooks name is Hugo - very nice guy.;4
Stayed at this hotel when healthcare workers were not able to go home to their families during Covid. Older hotel but my room was cleaned every single say which was a plus. Shoutout to Pil from the front desk for always providing excellent customer service.;4
After reading some of the reviews prior to our trip, my boyfriend and I did not know what to expect but we thought the hotel was great. We just returned from a weekend trip (Sept 20-Sept 23) and spent 3 nights at the Empire in room 821. We paid a special rate of 280 which I think is reasonably for the hotel, I probably wouldn't have paid more this hotel.  We arrived around noon and were able to check right into the hotel. Upon checking in the lobby was fairly empty and we only had to wait a few minutes to check in. After going to our room, I loved the decor. Of course the room was tiny but that is to be expected while in NYC. Last time I stayed at the Parker Meridian (around the same rate) and I would say our room at the Empire was larger. The bed was comfy and clean, as was the;4
I was on a business trip and stayed here. I was going to have to spend a lot of time in the hotel room working and when i got to the room it was really small so i called down to the front desk to see if there was another room that was a little bigger because i needed some more space to work. Ricky helped me and found me a new room that was much bigger and even had a wonderful view! Great experience. Thanks Ricky!;4
5min walk to universal studios and city walk,food was excellent,helpful staff Rooms very nice,would have no hesitation staying there again;4
We stay here every year because it is close to Lincoln center and other attractions. More of a boutique hotel. The rooms are not large and the hotel sometimes shows its age. But the service has been good and it is a very convenient location. It's a little pricey for what it is but you can often get some good deals depending on when your going. I think it is worth it overall. So give it a try.;4
My wife and I got a regular room on the 18th floor. It was reasonably spacious, nice appointments and the bed was very comfortable. And for being on the 18th floor, the water pressure was magnificent. It had a tub/shower combination and the shower head was magnificent.  One thing that caught us off-guard though, was that there were NO vending machines of any kind on any of the floors.  If you wanted a soda or some munchies, you had to go down to the gift shop on the lobby floor, and there was no refrigerator in the room. Bottled water WAS available in the room for $5.00 though! There of course was a mini bar in the room, but we didn't even open it!  The service was very good and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful - they couldn't do enough to make your stay enjoyable.;4
I spent a night there, coming from Europe before moving to east Los Angeles the day after. The hotel is well positioned and quite modern. I took the breakfast (a little expensive - over 30USD) and I parked my car in the parking in front of the hotel. My issue is that the announced price is half what I paid (room + taxes + breakfast + parking), I would prefer a more straight price announce;4
This hotel is rich in history and offers central location to many of the sites and locations for every traveler. My room was small but it was everything i needed. Staff were prompt and professional. Tick Tok dinner connected to lobby had great meals and excellent service.;4
Stayed at the Empire end of October for 5 nights. We were immediately upgraded to a larger room, which was fairly large for NY standards. Restaurant was excellent and so were drinks in the lobby bar - rooftop terrace was already closed though... Overall very pleasant stay, would recommend!;4
For the price, I think this is a good in-between hotel.  Meaning, it's not the Mercer or the Four Seasons obviously.  But, much more interesting and swanky than a Marriott.  Feels like a W with some historical architecture.  The location is great for walking and subway access.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  We had only two short waits for the infamously slow elevator, but nothing horrible.  The bathroom is seriously lacking in practicality of design.  Air conditioner worked well and wasn't too loud.  Beds were comfortable and the view from our room was fabulous of Lincoln Center.  You can hear noisy people in the hall, but typical of a building this age.;4
Fast check in/check out.  Don't park onsite, there is  easy and cheap off site parking.  Room could have been a bit cleaner (better vacuumed) but a good value for the price.  Clean, safe and updated looking hotel.;4
Our family of four (w/ kids ages 6 and 2) stayed here during Labor Day weekend 2011.  We were in town for a family event and decided to visit Universal Studios during the last 2 days of our stay.   This was my first stay ever at a Hilton and chose this hotel because of the close proximity to the park.    The front desk was able to accommodate for our early check-in because I called when we were about 30 min. away.  After check-in a nice lady behind the counter walked us to the elevator as we headed to our room.  We had a nice size room with a great view of City Walk and the 101 freeway.  Overall friendly hotel staff- one employee even offered to take a family picture of us in their nice lobby.   The shuttle service was very convenient and ran about every 15 min.   There was one;4
We visit the Hollywood/Silver Lake/Los Feliz area at least five times a year for appointments at Children's Hospital. We've tried the Orchid Suites Hotel (good value, but too far away from the hospital), Travelodge on Vermont (too many bug bites, too much secondhand smoke, and too crowded) and Hollywood Hotel. If you can find a good rate and get a room facing the parking lot, it is very good value. Breakfast was fine and filling (granted, we only stayed two days), the pool area was pleasant, and our room was quiet, clean, and very roomy. We will definitely be staying again. Children's Hospital is walking distance, saving on parking and the 12 check-out time is generous. The neighborhood itself doesn't get safer/more interesting until you've gone maybe 5 blocks up Vermont,;4
Lets start with the best part -the breakfast. And the one who made our breakfast -Hugo. Very friendly, always asked how we are doing, made us great omelettes and scrambled eggs. He really did put on effort to make sure our day starts of well, and that we're having a good stay.  The room was clean and nice -you will want to ask for a room further away from the street if you are sensitive.  The location was really good! Just 100 m from metro, and you get easily anywhere by metro and/or bus. The location was safe and nearby you find many restaurants, so you just have to walk 10 steps and you have a restaurant in front of you.  There was a smoothie and juicebar super close aswell,and that was a big plus.  Overall we had a happy experience, and if you are travelling with a budget, We;4
I just returned from a five-day stay at the Premier Inn in London County Hall, and it was fantastic. The room was outstanding, the staff was wonderful, and the breakfast was amazing. I also took advantage of a meal deal on the last night, which included three courses and a drink for each of us for the price of two. The hotel is located on the south bank, close to the London Eye and other nearby attractions.;4
Perfect location for this hotel, not far from anywhere and from public transport as well, five nights stay with the family. Everything seems to work, appart from free internet that is slow in the lobby, and when you want to purchase it it takes so long to go through with your credit card that you give up... Breakfast is good and reasonably priced, this is not a luxurious hotel but it works, considering the time we spend in a bedroom in New York. Very efficient concierge. Rooms on the street side can be noisy but bearable. We will come back.;4
We stayed at this hotel in September. The hotel is based near Madison square . Ideally located for Times Square and many other popular tourist spots.  Although we didn't spend much of our time in the hotel (we were non stop visiting New York attractions). The room was clean and comfortable,fresh towels and bedding. Toiletries were provided. Staff were very friendly and helpfull. The hotel has a history and it's Decor is Art Deco. Worth a visit to the basement to view the photos of past guests. Muhammad Ali was here after one of his fights.  Would highly recommend this hotel to people visiting New York.;4
The position and the views from selected rooms are awesome. The staff is very helpful but as we and the staff acnowledged, it is huge hotel and misunderstandings happens a bit but the staff handles it every time. Been there now 7 year in a row and it will our future NYC hotel next year also.;4
Hotel is in a perfect location across from MSG and a few blocks from Times Square and the Empire State. Easily accessible to the subway, 2 minutes away. Great range of bars and restaurants nearby within the area of the hotel and Times Square is good walk away to access the bars and restaurants there. Could do with tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but that would be my only negative from the trip.;4
The Riad has elements of ancient and modern set just north of the souks and square, a short walk (15 mins) from the great magic that the medina in Marrakech has to offer. Set in the heart of a series of turns near the local simple shops, the Riad offers excellent service, friendliness and a desire to please the guests. The rooms are beautiful, daily breakfast a real treat on the sun soaked terrace and the hammam experience a pleasant one. Local wine also available and excellent. High end pricing for morocco accommodation but luxury feel.  A couple of points to note in what otherwise is responsive service, breakfast order on our last day, cutlery and contents missing, wrong eggs, etc and offered a massage but not informed about the extra 80 euro charge that this would bring until;4
For a hotel in Midtown, it was perfect. What I mean by that is that most Midtown hotels don't have free coffee in the room and a lot of the perks people are used to these days. But the staff is great, there is a small Cafe in the lobby area for coffee and snacks, and the history of the place is one-of-a-kind. If you are looking for an interesting stay with staff that stays on top of security and housekeeping, I recommend The New Yorker.;4
We had about 1.5 days to spend in the LA-area before our long trip overseas...so we decided to check out Universal Studios Hollywood.  The hotel parking was reasonable (we self-parked, very easy).  The property is older but well-maintained.  Staff is friendly.  Got a free-upgrade to executive level since I'm a HHonors member.  We had an alcove room which was very well appointed and clean.  Great views.  Great shuttle service to Universal Studios/CityWalk OR just walk - only takes a few minutes.  Breakfast was outsanding and was discounted for HHonors members.  Overall great stay and worth the short drive from LAX.;4
My room felt bigger than the average NYC hotel room, and was nicely furnished. It was nice and comfortable.  I requested a quiet room, and it actually was!   I did miss not having a coffee maker or a fridge, but that seems to be NYC.   Really nice lobby for a drink.  PJ Clarke's is right next door.  Bathroom feels a little cramped, and what is it these days about the half glass door that doesn't slide so you are all the way closed?  All in all a good value at about $200/nite;4
This was my second stay at The Jane and it's now the only NYC hotel for me.  I don't mind a shared bath and the bunk bed rooms are tiny(see more about Captains room below),  but it's perfect for a solo traveler especially one that has far more planned in NYC than being in a hotel room.  The bathrooms are cleaned 24/7.  The rooms are pristine.  The staff really takes care of the hotel.  Free bottled water, free wifi, crisp cotton robes, plentiful towels and slippers in every room.  No closet, but plenty of hooks on walls and door and drawers under the bed.  I wonder if the bellhop would store your empty suitcase for you to keep it out of the way?  It'd be worth asking as the staff is sooooo accommodating.  Did I mention free bike rentals?  With the trail up and down the Hudson;4
Forgive me if this review is a little long, this is my first time writing a review!  Tip number 1!- For airport transfers hire a town car. It is a fixed price and very comfortable. it costs about $95, however the taxi can work out alot more on the meter, especially if you hit traffic!  We stayed for 4 nights at the start of May. It was our first time in LA and I must say everything is so far apart, it takes alot of time [and money]  to get around. However the location of the Hilton is perfect for Universal Studios (the shuttle picks up from right outside the hotel and drops off right outside city walk). Also Hollywood is quite close.  Ok now the hotel is a good standard. When I arrived check in was very quick and there was no waiting around whatsoever  Tip 2-  It is well worth;4
If you want to stay in the Lincoln Center/Columbus Circle neighborhood, this hotel is your best best. The Hudson Hotel is a terrible value by comparison, and much more hectic and impossible to get any service at. Empire is smaller, quieter, with more attentive service, and rooms are significantly larger with much better views. There are some quirks - -the furnishings can be a bit worn down (not the bed, the bed is great, thankfully!) and this is one of the worst-soundproofed hotels I have ever stayed at in a city in terms of how much street noise comes into the room. Also, hotel manager who may be reading this, you really need to give full-sized ironing boards to guests and the famous $8 bottled water bedside makes you look really absurd and creates unnecessary negative feelings;4
Stayed here as a couple for 4 nights. 40 mins drive from LAX. The exterior doesn't seem much, but it appears that the rooms and hallways had been renovated. The rooms, bathroom and furniture was just as new! We would definitely be back!  Pros: - Free breakfast (hot and cold selections) - Freshly made omelette and waffles made to order (They limit to only 1 omelette p/person) - Free and strong Wifi -Coffee/ Bar fridge and Microwave in store - Car rental office next to reception for easy hire (approx USD100 p/day for a Kia) - 5-8 mins drive to Hollywood Blvd  Cons: - Room is smaller than the typical American size - Bed is a double bed, maybe too small for some - Parking at hotel is expensive - No wardrobe. Handing rack provided only;4
Hotel very close to the airport however I never heard a plane which was surprising. Rooms are clean and have everything you need. Shuttle bus service is excellent they seem to be going constantly. The staff are friendly and helpful. Seems to offer everything you need from an airport hotel. I would stay there again.;4
It's right next to Penn Station and Madison Square garden, so across the street from the subway that you can take all the way to LaGuardia and down to the World Trade Center, as well as other routes. Just south of Times Square.  Otherwise, it is an older high rise building, I would guess 90 years old. Not sure it was ever deluxe and there's some deferred maintenance.  Rooms are small - at least mine was, and they told me that they upgraded me from an even smaller room.  The upkeep and maid service is good, however.  Wyndham management means its got the shampoo, conditioner, handcream, soaps, decent cable TV, safe and wi-fi.  No frills like minibars or anything like that, no guidebook to the hotel or city or anything.  Decent place if you really intend to spend most of your time;4
The empire hotel was very nice with a good location handy to everything we wanted to do in the city.  The staff was friendly and helpful and although the upgraded room was small it was clean and nicely decorated. I said it was small but it was, in my experience, typical for NY.  Did not go to the rooftop club but there was no noise or other issues from it on the room floors.  Sat in the lobby bar and had snacks and drinks. Again, service was good and prices reasonable for NY.  Overall, a very good experience at a hotel which was new for me.;4
Stayed here for one night so we could visit Universal!  We managed to score a free upgrade so we were able to view Universal Studios from our room, which was awesome.  I thought the foyer was great, staff friendly, and the room was also nice.  The location is ideal for visiting the park with shuttles if you're too lazy to walk the 5 minutes to the park enterance.  All in all - a great location and comfortable accommodation for anyone visiting Universal Studios!;4
Location great, rooms small but adequate, food and cafe very good. Although the rooms are a bit shabby they are all you need when visiting New York as we were out and about from early to late. Loved our time here.;4
We stayed from 6/30-7/3. We arrived at the same moment the President of Taiwan arrived. We had to wait for security to make sure she was safe. The elevators were secured until she was safe. The staff handled the check-in quickly. They did apologize that the elevators were being repaired and the ones working were limited. The rooms were very nice and front desk staff were very attentive. The hotel has shuttles to Universal and is in walking distance, too! The hotel has an excellent breakfast!! Universal City Walk has great restaurants for lunch/dinner that are outside the park. We had a great visit;4
Just returned after 4 nights at the New Yorker.  The hotel is right opposite penn station which was fantastic as we got the train from the airport. The hotel is art deco style and has a huge reception . Check in was quick and we arrived in our double room on floor 21.  The room was ok it was slightly outdated decor wise but it was clean and had a bath and a shower. They made the bed each day and changed the towels. The bed was really comfortable and There was a tv and a small wardrobe with a safe in it.  There was no kettle or tea/ coffee facilities which was a shame as all you wanted in the Morning was a coffee. However opposite the hotel is a Starbucks roughly $5 a coffee or a macdonalds about $3 a coffee. There is also 2 supermarkets 1 minute walk next door should you need;4
Iâve now been to this hotel twice and I love it! Yes itâs a little tired in places but itâs clean, steeped in history and in a great location. The beds are super comfy, the showers are hot and powerful and the Tick Tock diner is a must-huge portions, quick service and tasty food. Also if you head down the escalator from the reception youâre transported back to its heyday with lots of memorabilia about the hotel and itâs history.;4
We really liked this hotel and we specially liked the hotels breakfast, they have fresh fruits, scrambled eggs och waffles. Our favorite employee truly was Hugo who was nice everyday and made us plain scrambled eggs :) haha. NIce hotel!;4
Nice room for the price. Check in well staffed with friendly people. Room was modern, clean.  Located very close to Penn Station. Lobby has an art deco feel to it. Outside noise was less than I expected.  Would stay here again.;4
Excellent stay in a great hotel.  Check in was quick and efficient and we were in our room within 20 minutes (no wait for the elevators - as experienced by some).  Room was small - as expected, but spotlessly clean and warm.  Bathroom again small but clean.  All the staff we encountered from check in, concierge, housekeeping and security were cheerful, friendly and helpful.  Hotel in a very central location, easy to walk to all major attractions and with a subway entrance on both corners what more could you want.;4
We stayed here for four nights and found the hotel quite acceptable. The staff were friendly and helpful, room was clean, and room fresh. Breakfast was better than the average motel and helped by freshly made omelettes. I was a bit shocked by the $22 a night parking charge. Wifi is complimentary and the pool looked ok. I am aware some reviewers have been disappointed by their stay. There may be some variation on rooms and service but we were satisfied.;4
The hotel has an excellent location, close to many attractions and subway station. The personnel is amazing, they help you on everything you need. Special mention to the people on the front desk and the bell men on the door, I will definitely consider this hotel on a next stay in NYC.;4
I recently stayed at Days Inn hotel and I  would definitely return. This is a budget hotel and is perfect for a base to sleep and shower. We had a couple of problems with our bathroom and the staff were very friendly and helpful and got the problems sorted quickly for us. The room was cleaned everyday. Our room was boiling on our first night so we asked if the heating could be turned down and this was also fixed for us. WiFi is a little slow but it does work. Thanks for a great stay :);4
If you're going to Universal Studios, you can't pick a better located hotel.  You can walk to the park, or take the convienently offered shuttle.  The staff was helpful, and the hotel was clean.  The best feature of the hotel is the location.;4
Thoroughly enjoyed the trip and the hotel was excellent. Be careful of the prices of the food in the room but other than that I have no complaints. AC made the room nice & cool, shower was lovely and the maids kept the room spotless.;4
An impromptu stay in NYC and I was pleasantly surprised to have booked a room on the coveted 13 floor...the penthouse, for under $100! Obtaining a parking space was daunting--it took 45 minutes. My rating would have been higher but venturing to other floors to find a vending machine, I found unkept and untidy lower floors. I do plan to stay again but ONLY if I can obtain a room on the penthouse floor.;4
Wasn't great, wasn't bad. Rooms were very good, pool was clean. Breakfast was wonderful. Park on the street,its free from 6pm till 8am. Save yourself $25/ night. Mike at the front desk is very knowledgeable and goes out of his way to make your stay the best it can be. Laundry facility is decent, this hotel is a good value. Near a hospital so expect sirens.;4
I stayed at the Jane with a friend for 2 weeks and we already knew the rooms were small and we had to share a bathroom so we weren't expecting nothing fancy, just a place to sleep and take a bath. We asked for a room on the upper floors when we made the reservation (to avoid the noise) and they gave us one. And there were absolutely no bed bugs. We were on a budget on this trip and it seemed like the perfect hotel for what we could afford. We really liked it and the staff was nice. One of the guys at the front desk even spoke a little Portuguese with us every time we saw him. We had breakfast once in their restaurant and it was delicious! There were 2 bathrooms on our floor (with 2 baths each) and we never had to wait to take a shower and it was always clean. On one of the;4
"Our visit to New York should have started in late August for three nights but as we were travelling from Boston on Amtrak we were delayed for two days by hurricane Irene.   This meant we arrived at 6pm on our last day feeling very tired and jaded. Our booking at the Empire Hotel had been cancelled instead of reduced to 1 night by our UK agent, so this felt like the final straw.   How wrong we were however, with a very supportive team on front desk , who simply said ""dont worry we will make sure you have the rooms you need for tonight"". This level of support continued the next day as we were unable to get information on our ongoing Amtrak service, and were offered a later checkout whilst the Concierge tried to get information. This level of customer service was really excellent,";4
Lovely to spend a couple of days in this great city - right next to Lincoln Center! As soon as we got there, we headed up to the Rooftop to relax and enjoy a cocktail and watch the sun go down in the December sky. What a treat!;4
I stayed here with my son and his family coming back from a trip to Canada and I was really pleased to come to a Hilton with good service, nice rooms, big lobby area and facilities. We were at the end of our trip so a bit tired but wanted to have a good experience before going home. Universal Studios was walking distance from the hotel and we had a ball! There is a really nice restaurant in the hotel which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner till late - good service, great food. There is also a nice swimming pool which I didnt use but did sit in the pool area as it has covered parts where you can lie down and read which was very pleasant as the weather was unusually hot for January. Rooms were large - I did book an executive room and the bed was comfortable as it usually is at;4
The hotel is located in upper westside. It is across the street from the lincoln center. There is a Starbucks that opens really early (which was great giving jet lag). I had a junior suite which was large enough. Staff is very friendly and you can have an exclusive access to the rooftop if you stay at the hotel!;4
When we go to events/conferences in Manhattan, we stay at the Empire Hotel. It is well located, close to the metro station,  a park across the street, a lot of good restaurants, close to Joe's coffee shop,  clean with a great small bar. We really liked it.;4
We got a great price although our room was tiny. However, new bathroom bathrobe and coffee which not all room have.  Elevators were always quick and wireless was fine.  Perfect location and easy block from Penn Station.  No wait for cabs on that long line    Highly recommend.;4
DidnÂ´t have to wait for bathroom not even once. Everything was clean. Staff is great, very polite and willing to help.  The weird thing is that it seems to have a few strange people actually living there. IÂ´m not sure about  but IÂ´m guessing because these people were in bedrooms with different locks and they really act like theyÂ´re living there for a while.   Anyway, it wasn't something that made me feel uncomfortable or anything. I really enjoyed.  I would stay there again, for sure.;4
Enough of the original building, and its fittings, remain to evoke a sense of that quintessential art deco New York of the 1920s and 30s. Emerging from the wonderful brass fronted elevators into the magnificent foyer, before exiting directly into the bustle of downtown New York, it is just possible to experience a flavour of those heady days.  However, it seems that some of the opulence of the age has been lost, and the hotel would appear to be in the midst of an extended, and much needed, re-fit.  My room was adequate as were front of house services, but, perhaps, left something to be desired if this hotel is to live up to its location and its glorious past.   The domestic staff, on the other hand, were magnificent, super friendly and extremely helpful ( they might be able to;4
I will stay here again. And again. Great location, friendly people, Room was small (I booked a small room) but very nice, modern in a New York  way, Great bathroom. And all the action and restaurants you could wish for just out the door. For the price this is the place to stay. Next to Colberts theatre and Gallaghers Steakhouse.;4
We spent a happy five days at the Hilton Universal Studios and enjoyed it very much. Nice room, good food, good overall facility and next door to Universal with a free shuttle to the park. Presently undergoing upgrades in a couple of areas but these are well managed and to not impact the guest;4
Booked 2 rooms for a mid week stay (NYU Med School Graduation at Alice Tully Hall)  and needed to be within walking distance of Lincoln Center.  The proximity to the Center and many top notch restaurants is truly excellent!  The beds are very comfortable, bathrooms a bit small and no place to put your toiletries, the closet is a free standing unit with the refrig underneath so it's difficult to hang long garments,  the front entrance and lobby are very classy, the front desk people are most accommodating, the bellhop and valet were friendly and so helpful, the parking is great ( either valet or self park), we did the 24 hour special self park hotel rate and saved dollars, very fast and easy to park and pick up car upon leaving, fully stocked bar if you choose to indulge ( we did;4
Stayed in this hotel hostel for the London Film and Comic-Con with a friend. Was a little overwhelmed by the openness of the place since I am very nervous around new people and everyone there was a stranger. Shared a room with three other guys. I had a surprisingly comfortable bunk bed, though the squeakiness of the others was a little annoying. The room was mostly clean, no real issues despite mild noise from outside at night. Opening the room doors was at first troublesome due to the awkward key mechanism. Toilets and kitchen facilities were okay, but the shower rooms were the worst part - each shower had a different way of operating, the floors were slippery, and there was no where to put your clothes, meaning you had to leave them outside the shower and someone could easily;4
I was in NYC with girlfriends and we had 3 rooms at The New Yorker:  One suite and two double rooms.  All were on upper floors.  Check in was very easy and we were able to access our suite upon check-in even though we were early.  The lobby is nice, but the halls when you come off the elevator are in need of update (new carpet and paint would go a long way to improve).  Our suite was a good size with three closets, pull out sofa, chair, small fridge, and sink.  No microwave or coffee maker.  The bathroom was small but sufficient. The bedroom had 2 double beds (not queen - but we knew that when we booked).  There was not much dresser space but we weren't in need since we were only staying 2 nights.  The double rooms were both on the same floor and each had 2 double beds.  The;4
What was lacking in terms of business center (really don't stay here if you anticipate needing to make last minute copies or use the printer), was made up for by the exceptional service of Bernard. The roof bar is gorgeous.;4
Loved chillin' in the lobby while we watched Chris the Concierge entertain us!!!  Quotes: Us: can we get cheap tix to La BohÃ©me? Chris: never say cheap to a concierge, say affordable.  Gotta love that!  This guy LOVES his job. He was on fire helping everyone with his pep!! Don't lose this guy!  Room was warm comfy but construction overhead and no free internet  nor coffee during storm ð¢ bummer!;4
I stayed in room 1141.  Good shower, very comfortable beds, peaceful room adequate size.  This hotel is well located for ease of travel and is located within walking distance from two subway stations Columbus Circle 59 St and Lincoln Center 66 St. The subway is easy to navigate (except for Saturday maintenance).;4
Stayed in a room with 2 queen size beds which were comfortable and the room was fine. The shower however had terrible water pressure which let the bathroom down. The staff were friendly and the hotel is in a great location close to Times Square, the Empire State, Madison Square Garden and shopping with a train station and subway next to it. The attached Tick Tock diner was very good also.  Unfortunatley there is a compulsory facilities charge which covers use of the business centre, fitness centre and telephone calls....none of which we needed or wanted to use but had to pay for anyway and thats what would put me off staying here again despite the hotel being good overall.;4
My husband and I stayed here on a Tuesday. We had tickets to Universal Studios, and picked this hotel because it was closest to the park. We tried to check in a little early, but there were no rooms available. The lady at the front desk was a little rude and short with us. She told us we'd have to pay a $150 deopsit. We parked in self parking which was $18 a day. That was a little pricy. It's understandable that they charge this much because they are so close to the park, but we felt like maybe they should have discounted rates for guests of the hotel. After we were done at the park we walked over to the hotel to check in. The man that was at the front desk was much more friendly and helpful. Our room was still not available, so he upgraded us to a bigger room on the 2nd floor.;4
We enjoyed our stay at the Hollywood Hotel.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The room clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was wonderful.  Located close to the Metro and and bus line we were able to get where ever we wanted to be.  Would certainly recommend!;4
Very well located hotel, you could walk into Universal within 10 minutes which was very useful. Friendly and efficient staff, the room was comfortable and clean. We thought the pool area was a little small for the number of guests and could do with a refresh.;4
This is the 4th time we have stayed here.  This Hotel continues to be great value for money. Probably the best feature is the location. On top of Penn Station, Opposite MSG and walking distance to the ESB and Times Square.  Parts of the hotel are looking a little tired but nothing major. Room was on the small side but who cares.  Check in was good. We arrived about 8:00am and were provided a room by 9:30am. Would definitely recommend.;4
We stopped at the Hollywood Hotel for five nights as part of a tour of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas. The hotel was really nice and the King Suite was huge with a spa bath, bar area and living room area with sofas, tables, chairs, etc. We also had two TVs and 3 phones. We had the downstairs King Suite which seemed dark all the time but there were plenty of lamps/lights to compensate. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really good, as was the housekeeping, our room was spotless. I would have given the hotel 4.5 stars if I could. The only reason I wouldn't was that the bar was not open at all on the Monday and Tuesday we were there and there is not a lot immediately around the hotel. One other point (not the hotel's fault) is that it;4
We spent 4 nights @ the hilton universal city , opting for this resort as our based camp to circulate around LA. The best location if you plan to hit the universal studios , a shutlle will drop you at the universal citywalk every 15 minutes, or walk ( it takes 6 minutes).  Close to Hollywood and Beverly hills ( 5 minutes from sunset bld). So great The rooms are not so great : a bit old, double beds instead of queens bed , which is a shame as it is not very confortable. No space for a rollaway bed neither. The pool is very nice : large, with a great jacuzzi, maybe a bit of painting necessary, but the pool was never too crowded, the food very nice. Great experience.  THe food options are amazing  : try any of the buffets on friday, saturday or sunday brunch. Amazingly tasty. We;4
We got this place for $130 a night through quikbook. What a smoking hot deal!!! We figured we saved enough to buy an extra 7 pairs of shoes.  My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights. Like the others have said before, the location is great. We were steps away from the Grand Street metro station. After a hot and exhausting day of shopping and sightseeing, we were especially glad to be able to get back doing as little walking as possible. We didn't need to take the taxi at all while in town. The hotel is at the edge of Chinatown and a few blocks away from Little Italy. We picked up fruits from one of the stores nearby to eat in the morning. A couple of times, we bought some great Italian meat, cheeses and bread to eat at the hotel and another time for a picnic in;4
We were happy we chose this hotel and location for our family time in LA. We had stayed at Anaheim and visited the parks and this was our next stop. We purchased a two day Universal pass as for not much more it allowed us to spread our experience over morning and nights . Studio city offered lots of dining options and shops. An Uber took us to the Grove one day and the next we drove to Santa Monica. Was a nice hotel and good service;4
Super convenient for visiting the park and easy to find when getting there.  Very nicely outfitted room and excellent amenities.  Just don't put anything in the fridge as there is no temperature control and everything freezes solid;4
Good location, nice room but on the street so too noisy, very kind service. Room is well equiped but everything quite expensive. I didn't use all the hotel facilities like the swimming pool, bar and restaurant.;4
The room was much smaller than expected - the double bed just about fit in the room!! Having said that, we had a stunning view of the Empire State and Madison Square Garden. The room was clean, but absolutely freezing. the cold seeps through the old windows, we was using the window seal as a fridge! We did have A/C so slept with the heater on all night.   Walking distance to all tourist hot spots - Big Bus Tour stops right outside. Plenty of bars/restaurants/deli's/supermarkets around to get all that you need. The Tick tock cafe linked to the hotel was delicious - would recommend stopping there for breakfast!  Overall a great stay - would return in the spring/summer to not have to sleep in the freezing cold room!;4
This was our third time at Ameritania.  It's a good hotel for a small family or a couple getaway.  Like other NYC hotels, the standard rooms are small.  However, great service.  Excellent location with Time Square a 5 minute walk away, Central Park and Rockefeller Center about 10 minutes, and food options all around.  The Icon Parking garage was just across the street.  The only negative was the carpet that could use a little bit of shampooing (since our socks were turning black).  Will definitely be coming back.;4
Hotel lobby and room were clean. Staff was very friendly. The only negative was that our television picture was scrambled on every channel. I reported it to the front desk and they never fixed the problem.;4
We wanted to be close to Universal Studios, with interconnecting rooms to suit our family dynamic.  Great food - buffet had an excellent variety and evenings meals were good, good quality environment - dÃ©cor could do with a bit of an update but very clean and well presented. Recommend Highly;4
It would have been a 5/5 but the first room i got given had construction vehicles on the road below that beeped for hours. I asked to change rooms. The man on the desk said a comment about being in New york which i understand as Iâve been a few times before but nobody could have slept thru that. I took a video it was bad. Anyway,after changing rooms, it was nice. Maids came everyday, the safe broke after a couple of days but it didnât bother me. Lifts werenât as bad as iâd read about, a few minutes wait at most. I would definitely recommend. Location is the best.;4
Stayed here for three nights, excellent location right by penn street subway and near times square.  Check in fine apart from allocating us a room which people were occupying but that was soon sorted by giving us a new room on 25th floor.  The room itself was bigger than expected with two showers (double, double) and suited us fine, it does need renovating but to be honest we weren't in the room for long so for us it didn't matter.  The hotel bar is very reasonable price wise and we didn't use the diner as the hotel is so central.  No charges for us to pay since we booked with virgin holidays but we did have to pay 5 dollars per suitcase to store them on our last day which was to us seemed like a money maker.;4
We were spending the day at Universal Studios and we thought it would be fun for the kids to stay in a hotel for a night.  So we booked the The Hilton Universal City/Los Angeles purely for location.  I was a little concerned because of the recent reviews, but all in all, it was a nice stay.  The Room: We had a room with double queen beds.  The room was nice with the exception of the multiple stains on the carpet.  The showers were nice and hot, with good water pressure.  We had a high floor and the view of the city was awesome.  The kids LOVED looking at the view.  The Pool: The pool was busy.  Not much room for the kids to do much.  They only waded for about 30 minutes.  There is a bar and dining by the pool.  Room Service: I don't recommend room service.  They got our order;4
"I thought that the hotel was decent for the price and the good location (walking distance to Los Feliz) It's a nice property and clean enough.  They have a small pool next to the main building that was cold, but clean and well maintained; the rooms are sizable.  The BEST part of my stay was going to breakfast (included) where a guy named Hugo (he has a fabulous female counterpart whose name I didn't catch) will make you an omelet exactly how you like it.  They staff is courteous and friendly.";4
Lovely hotel in a fantastic location...close to everything but far enough out to not always be in the hustle and bustle of the city.  Mr Ze welcomed us to the hotel and was very polite and answered all of our questions about the hotel and the previous bad weather.  Rooms are very nice but a few minor things let it down cosmetically but is a great base. As mentioned before on another review the room was way too hot!;4
So arrived on the 14th feb and check out is the 20th feb i was in room 1006, my first Impression was the reception is nice and tidy the front of house staff are helpful and door staff are fantastic, I liked the fact no body took my cases to the room I'm not daft i have stayed in hotels before so i can manage a door and light switch and was very happy with this, the room was okay on first impression but it wasn't without its faults !! i put my clothe in the drawers and closed them and like magic the drawers re opened so i shut them again but 2 mins later the drawers were open again it was quite funny, so i folded a few pieces of paper and out them under the front legs easy fix but maybe something more permanent would resolve the issue, now there is like a arty clock on the wall;4
I am tough on reviews having flown 2.8 million miles.  I always start with the first part ease of everything. The software is great all my requests were taken care of except for high floor. I was on 3 because that is where their club is. Checkin,  rooms all nicely done. Need comfortable,  view ok looking at lax but not their for that.    The club is well worth the upgrade.  Breakfast in the morning lox, hour omelettes everything you could want. Dinner all cold foods bur foods quality and$3 fir a corrina wad nice.  Club people also very friendly.   Everything wad clean and un great shape works stay here again.  Paid about $200 a night with club and included $30 of California taxes.;4
The hotel is in a great location if you are wanting to stay near Central Park. The rooms are small but overall it was okay. The staff here were really rude. My voucher advised we had free wifi during our stay, however they only offer free wifi in the lobby, which was not what we were told. I phoned reception and spoke to someone - who then transferred me through to someone else, who advised that when you check in you should be given an access code to receive the wifi in your room, which we didn't, and reception blatantly refused to give us one, however once I was transferred through to the IT department, they happily gave us a code to use. The hotel also charges you to call toll free numbers! Housekeepers also never gave us enough towels, and we had to constantly phone for more;4
We had an awesome time here, it was our family first time going to universal studios and we Loved it. We stay at the Hilton right next door and it was very convenient we would definitely stay again. The very few issues we had was the free WiFi was super slow for us more towards the later evening probably because everyone came back to the hotel to relax and sleep. The bathroom was beautiful but we did had an issue with water spilling out of the tub whenever we took a shower mainly due to the design of the tub, the tub wasnât high enough to stop the water from spilling outside onto the bathroom floor so with that being said we had to use about 2-3 towels just to wipe and soak up the water that spill out. Then there was the shuttle to the park, the shuttle is not provided by Hilton;4
We went early this year to the Hollywood Hotel and it was a nice experience. The room is comfortable and the bed is good for a nice sleep. The breakfast is really good and the service is really polite. They have parking so that is a big plus.;4
I stayed at the New Yorker during a weekend of shopping and Broadway shows in Manhattan and believe itâs a good choice for a short trip. The price is ok and the location is just great nearby Times Square.  Service is good and quite quick compared to other others in the same neighborhood. You do not wait so much of time for the check-in and check-out.  The rooms are comfortable, although a bit old, but this goes with the affordable price.;4
I had stayed at this hotel the first time I visited New York and the location, proximity to the subway and comfortable rooms brought us back again.  The hotel itself if beautiful, art deco and like many of the buildings in New York looks like something straight out of a movie! The rooms are small and basic but that is all we needed during our stay as we were out exploring the city from the crack of dawn until the wee small hours every day. The staff that we dealt with were really friendly and the attached tick tock diner served us the best breakfast we had during or entire stay.   Don't expect the lavishness of the plaza but if you are looking for a comfortable place to crash after a long day of sightseeing close to all the big attractions and with great links to everywhere in;4
The Location is very good, nice rooms, nice view over LA, small but nice pool. The breakfeast buffets and the brunch are still hig class, but compared to the past the size has been shrinked and the prices raised.     Try to avoid a room with connection door to avoid the noise of your neighbors.  unfortunatelly the Bar was way to cold and I don't like to sit in a bar in LA in a sweater :(;4
The Empire has a great vibe, near everything you could want, and the service is staff is just so friendly and helpful.    I highly recommend it...  If you have a chance, grab dinner at Ed's Chowder House which is attached to the hotel.. The food is superb.  Wrap up the evening by heading up to the newly redesigned rooftop for a cocktail.  It's got a nice lounge feel.  Enjoy!;4
The Hilton is perfectly situated - it's a simple walk up the hill to Universal Studios and City Walk and a walk down the hill to get to the Metro to go to Hollywood. The Transportation Desk was also able to organise a car service to take us to WB studios.  My favourite thing about this hotel is the porters (bell boys). They were extremely friendly and chatted to us while we waited for car services or when we returned to the hotel from a day out.  The rooms are on the older side but still functional. The ice machine on our floor broke and there was water all over the hallway floor. However, this was quickly rectified.  We tried the buffet breakfast and it was very, very good. However, I wouldn't like to pay its prices every morning!  The front desk staff were very pleasant and we;4
Nice, clean hotel near everything. 2 minute walk to seldom used line. The north South to uptown, times Square, downtown is about 5 or 6 minute walk. Cascade Cafe at end of block is fantastic for breakfast, fresh deli sandwiches, smoothies, and desert.. Awesome prices too. Hotel was clean, great location. The only downside is the street noise. It is LOUD with constant horns and sirens all night. So if you want to sleep at all, ask for something off street. There really isn't a need for;4
Check-in lasted forever as we had booked 2 connected rooms and the lady first said she couldn't find any and then she went 10 times to her boss to make sure that with an additional $50 she could give us the requested connected rooms as for her it was an upgrade. Anyways it was long but we got our 2 connected rooms. The pool was nice even if I have to say that the pool area is a bit small for such a large hotel. The great thing is really location as the hotel is a few steps away from universal which is great really. We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights as we visited Universal and Hollywood!;4
Had the chance to stay at the Hilton Universal for the second time and this hotel does not disappoint! It is conveniently footsteps away from universal studios! You donât even really have to take the shuttle to universal unless you have small children or elderly. Trust me it is much faster to just walk! We stayed in the king corner room . The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds super comfy! It has a fridge and large bathroom. The pool was nice too. If I had one negative comment it would be the food and drinks purchased at the hotel are super over priced. 4 beers, three hotdogs, 1 order of California rolls for $85! You are better off eating out elsewhere! Breakfast at the sienna restaurant though is worth it before heading out to universal studios even if it is pricy if you;4
Great view straight on to the Empire State Building as well as the Chrysler building, Madison square garden and downtown towards 1 World Trade and the Statue of Liberty. Balcony terrace was a bit neglected but the views were fabulous day or night even in the rain.  Wonderful art deco features throughout. 24 hour Tick Tock diner, Trattoria Restaurant and in the basement Butcher and Banker restaurant where you can dine in an old bank vault are all attached to the hotel.   My 1 criticism is the additional fees for phone, fitness centre, business centre and Wi-Fi which is compulsory. I didn't use any except the Wi-Fi which wasn't very responsive anyway so felt ripped off by this. If it's compulsory include it in the booking price. Even budget hotels in the UK provide free internet;4
I love how they have an attendant for the front door 24 hours a day. Nice hotel, my only comment is to get rid of all the snacks in the room, I wouldn't trust how long the snacks have been sitting there and I would wish it was an empty refrigerator that was provided, instead of all the beer,wine and soda. Not all guests eat or drink unhealthy foods. A microwave would've been a plus too! Would come back, location is great!  Thank you Ameritana!;4
Loved it!!!  My daughter & I stayed here Memorial Weekend and it was perfect.  My son lives in the city and suggested it as an alternative to the boring cookie cutter hotel experience, and Iâm so glad he did.  We stayed in a bunk bed room which was definitely small, but we werenât there to hang out in the room, so it was not an issue.  While we werenât quite sure what to expect with the shared bathroom, it was no problem at all.  I think I only saw 2 other people in there the whole weekend.   The toilets and showers are very private, and they have the wall-mounted soap dispensers, so you donât need to carry soap & shampoo with you. The hotel was very clean, everyone was very accommodating and courteous, and we even got a little dance routine put on for us when the doors were;4
"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would stay here again.  The customer service at check-in was great; fast and friendly. The hotel has a nice upscale style but there is some wear in places. Not a big deal to me, though. Parking is either $23 for valet or $18 per day for Self Park. Factor this in when you consider the overall cost to stay.    We had a King Bed Alcove room that was very spacious and comfortable. The windows were huge and offered a great view. Free bottled water and a fruit tray was a nice touch. WiFi was not free but I don't know how much it cost per day. Another thing to factor into the overall cost of the room. Ironing board and Iron and free safe were in the closet. Lots of outlets around the room to recharge all of our electronics. The bathroom was spacious";4
We just completed a one night stay in two connecting queen rooms on the 19th floor.  We were visiting Universal Studios.  The location is a 5 minute walk to Universal Studios.  I would recommend asking for a room that faces east/Universal Studios, otherwise you are overlooking the 101 freeway and there is some freeway noise.  We used the pool/jacuzzi and had a nice breakfast at the hotel.  The rooms were spacious and clean.;4
Don't pay attention to all of the picky reviews.  It's so easy for people to sit behind a screen and complain.  We had a very positive experience and will return to this hotel.  Thank you to Dennis, one of the doormen, who saved our trip from the very beginning.  We left our wallet in the cab and he noticed it as he was helping unload our bags.  What a nightmare that could have been!;4
The service was impeccable, especially from Nicole at the front desk, and the staff was all friendly and professional.    The room was clean and spacious, and the balcony had good views of downtown L.A. considering the location.  I wasn't a fan of the shower layout.  The location was convenient if your visiting the Hollywood and northern L.A. area where the museums are.;4
You can't beat the Lincoln Center location - steps from theaters, restaurants, Central Park, subway and shopping. We recommend arriving with your own snacks - and if you have them - K cups for your coffee. The minibar was horribly overpriced and they charged $3 per cup of coffee! That said, there are so many other benefits to the hotel (fun rooftop bar, OK lobby bar, great location) that overall that isn't a big deal. We were able to negotiate a better rate 24 hours prior to check in - well worth calling to see if you can (Call center was very accommodating - front desk, not so much). If they can't give a better rate, at least ask for upgrade from Regular to Queen room - huge difference in size (and thus comfort).;4
Compared to the Beacon, the rooms are small and there are no views, but the bathroom was nice and the bed comfortable. I didn't turn on the TV.  I appreciated the warning about the radiator heating system, but its clicking did not keep me awake. Front desk people were very friendly.;4
Very good hotel in good location just away from the madness of Times Square but close to lots of restaurants,theatres etc. Amenities at the hotel were adequate as we came to see New York not a hotel. The hotel honoured our request for a quiet room ( if it can be quiet in NYC) with view. Room 1215  facing 54th street on top floor did this. Julian the doorman was always helpful and friendly. We stayed a week and liked to call the Ameritania home!;4
We booked this property because it is close to our son's apartment. Knowing that it is not exactly in the center of all the action, we did not expect much. We were very pleasantly surprised! The Metro Bus is right outside the door and the subway is a couple blocks down the street. 3 stops take you right into the heart of Hollywood and the Walk of Fame. No traffic or expensive parking fees. The hotel can also arrange transportation to other sites. The immediate area is not for tourists. This hotel seems to be renovating in phases (but in 5 nights there, we never heard anything), so it does not all look consistent, but the service is very consistent- always friendly and accommodating. We booked the Junior Suite on the third floor looking into the cutest tropical courtyard with;4
We stayed there for many nights and we totally loved the hotel. It is located very close to the Universal Studios theme park ( there is a free shuttle to go there every 10-15 minutes or you can walk till there in 5 minutes ), the hotel is located on a hill so you have the car or you can take another free shuttle from the them park entry or you walk for about 10 minutes. The staff is very nice, the doormen helped us with the bags, the check in was fast and the room was very nice and clean. The beds were big and comfy, the bathroom was clean and the room was big, it had a television ( quite old model ), the iron and iron board, a free safe, the wordrobe, and a great view on L.A. The hotel has an outside pool too, we went there once and it is very nice, you can't bring outside food;4
The hotel best selling point is its location. 1 block from Macy's, across the street from MSG and a 15 minute walk to Empire state building.  We had no issues with the staff, they were always polite. We were offered an upgrade and negotiated a better deal for the 8 nights we stayed.  Our room was on 31st floor.  it was a good size, had room and even a fridge. The view of the empire state building was fab. The bathroom.. it definitely needs a makeover it was dated and not great.    The biggest issue is their facility/resort fees of $31 a day. its a complete and utter rip off. How the state is allowing hotels to charge these fees is beyond me. For the fee you get use of the business centre, gym and their 'free' wifi .... Shocking!;4
So you want to go to New York but you don't want to spend too much money. But you want to stay on Manhattan and not in the 'burbs. And even tho you don't want to spend too much, you don't want to stay in a dump.  Well, my friend, having searched exhaustively, there aren't a lot of options that fit your bill, but the Days Hotel is one of them, and we were perfectly happy when we stayed there.  Sure, you can carp about the spotty wi-fi, tired details, strictly business staff if you want. But overall the hotel is fine, it's right by 96th St subway and only 2 express stops into Times Square, and there are loads of places to eat/ buy groceries in the surrounding 2 blocks. So if it's GOOD VALUE you want and you're not a primadonna, this is the place.;4
The floor in 438 is uneven. It is dangerous. No one at check out seemed concerned, We enjoyed the location of the hotel. The room was small but comfortable. Parking was too expensive. The concierge was helpful.;4
Booked trip to New York for a special anniversary. The hotel is a wonderful place to stay. Great location right in middle of all the action. The art deco architecture is sublime. Arrived early for check in and greeted by Mohammed who was very friendly and welcoming. On noting that it was a special birthday trip he checked us in early and found us an incredible room on 37th floor with iconic views. Thank you.;4
I stayed at the Empire on my recent visit to NYC.  Great location near the Park, which is why I initially chose to stay there.  The rooms were a bit small but the staff made up for the minor disappointments.  From the reception to it's lobby service, everyone was always helpful and accommodating. Tommy G. stood out, always courteous and always greeting you with a smile.  Thanks Empire, see you in the Spring!;4
"This hotel is great for visiting Universal; however not the greatest value or service I have encountered. I used Hilton points for a 3 night stay for a family 2 adults and 2 older teens at 50000 points per night. For this we got a reasonable sized 2 queen bed room. At check in the hotel informed me that I had booked 1 night in a Universal view room and the other two in a standard. I said that I did not want to move room and would be happy if they could put us in a standard for the 3 nights to which I was advised that although it was early, the allocations had been made and we would have to check out of 1room and in to the other the following day - it took a request to see the manager to resolve this issue but we finally did. Secondly we were advised that as a Hilton diamond";4
Very clean and modern property in the heart of midtown. I would give the staff ten stars if I could. Majid, who checked us in after a long hot morning of travel, is a cheerful professional with a refreshing, dry sense of humor. On the day we left, bellman and keeper-of-the-portal Jeff stored our luggage for the day so we wouldn't have to drag it around the city before our return trip. The rooms are on the small side, which only matters if you plan to practice ballet or tai chi* in your room. Otherwise, the rates are astonishingly low for the location and quality.   * They have a fitness center for that, anyway.;4
All things considered, this was a great choice for staying in LA for one week for business meetings in various parts of the greater LA area, just wish the Regency Club was open since both my wife and I were living out of the hotel for one week.  They may also want to consider a breakfast and parking program rate.;4
We have stayed in New Yorker hotel when we have visited New York. Nikola Teslaâs room was still there. The hotel is pretty central to everything. Empire state building, 5th Avenue and time square are within walking distance! Will definitely go back.;4
This was a great spot to stay. My son and I traveled to see a couple of Rangers games and the location of the hotel, across the road from MSG was perfect. It is also perfectly located to visit Times Square, the Empire State Building and Central Park. Our room was a tad small considering the price, but we didn't spend a lot of time there as we were on the go most of our trip. Very friendly and accommodating staff. We were scheduled to arrive around 3 but ended up there at 1. They found us a room right away and booked us in without charging an early check in fee. Room was small but very clean. The bathroom had an older style tub but everything worked perfectly and again was very clean. A top notch experience!;4
I had to stay over for a work related event. The hotel is centrally located next to Lincoln center is is easily accessible by subway or NYC buses.  The room was modern and sleek. The bed was comfortable.  While the room was small, it fit my needs nicely. The shower was good as well. I would stay again.;4
Stayed here because itâs right across the street from Lincoln Center. The staff was incredibly kind and attentive. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of5 was due to the fact that there were no cups in room for coffee, glasses for water and 1 small box of soap.;4
What a great location to stay in Manhattan. The hotel is centrally located and we were able to walk to so many places in the city. The staff was spectacular. We got a room on Wyndam points actually had a suite. I would certainly go back there especially because of the location.;4
Staff on reception didn't make a first impression ....busy or not first port of call..... Door security fab crew...really helpful .. Rooms nice ..views brilliant  Easy access To the dinner and hotel eatery ...and beat of all possition of hotel was spot on x;4
Best location ever, 2 steps away from Central Park , Times Square and basically everthing in Manhattan. Our room was very quiet, didn't have a view but it didn't matter because it was very quiet. The only minus: they charge for internet in the room. I would love to be able to stay there  all the time.;4
"Really enjoyed the hotel, extremely quiet, front desk were all helpful and very approachable.  I think the breakfast every morning was our favorite part, everything was so tasty and the service from Hugo and Cinthya Ridrugues was outstanding.  every morning they smiled and made our breakfast fast and extremely efficient, even if they were busy.  Pool area was gorgeous and really clean.  Our room was a tad small but overall really great.  The taxi drivers told us were were not in the best or safest area ""in fact they told us it was Ghetto"".....however, we never felt any of that.  Overall our stay was really great and YES, we will stay again :)";4
This hotel is a good stay for the price and location! The room was a great size, staff were brilliant, especially kitchen staff! The Wi-Fi was good but limited to how many people could go on it at a time. The views were great if you had a room looking towards the LA skyline, even on the balcony you had a great view wherever you looked. The hotel only did breakfast, there wasn't an option of dinner/tea (no reason why). The breakfast was great! The pool was nice also, was warm and clean. The hotel overall was kept in great condition. The subway was literally 2 minutes away from the hotel which is great, taking you straight to downtown LA! The area is good but can be sketchy sometimes (depending on what time you're planning on coming back). We got an uber if we knew we would be;4
"Nice, but really old hotel. The location is not that good, but there is a train station very next there. It is a clean and safe place to stay, next to train, so it has the essentials. I stayed at Carter and it was nice, so here it could be ""perfect"".";4
After reading reviews on here I was rather worried that I had made a bad choice and emailed twice to request the price of an upgrade / refurb room before arriving but received a reply. I was dreading arrival.  Arrived around 4pm, there wasn't much of a queue and check in was quick and easy. Room was clean and tidy if a little dated. Room was a fair size, not huge but big enough for 2 adults with 3 suitcases for 5 nights. Room was cleaned daily and no complaints about room but pretty basic. As others say there is no tea / coffee but this doesn't bother me - there is a vending machine by the lift which we used to get water from, but a mini bar might be a nice edition. Hotel itself looks a little dated and worn, a little like it is still trying to me something it isn't.   The;4
The reviews were hit and miss so I did not know what to think.  The hotel had a nice entrance, adequate for the number of people in line.  Parking is in the back of the building.  The room I was in was pretty big.  There was a microwave and frig in a cabinet. The desk space was a little limited, but that was not as much of an issue as traffic noise.  If you are a light sleeper you want to be on the courtyard side of the hallway.  Breakfast was great.  Happy hour did not happen due to the cold temperatures.  The sauna was great, but broken on the third night.  TV locked up and it took an hour for the maintenance guy to come, unplug the TV, wait a minute, and plug it back in.;4
Nice hotel, great location. I really liked the bed, very comfortable. WIFI everywhere in the hotel where i needed it. Excellent service from all the staff. I wanna give a big thank you to Jerry in the reception, he was great and helped us everyday with various questions about the city, restaurants etc. Always very helpful and polite - keep up the good work man!;4
I stayed at the Empire for one night.  Located near the Metropolitan Opera and Columbus Circle, it's in a nice part of town.   I had a single room with a king size bed, not a big room but for business travel, no problem.   Check in was easy with a friendly staff and as I was leaving Jason was very helpful printing my boarding pass.  You can print your boarding pass for free in the business center but I wasn't smart enough to figure out how to do it.  The only slight negative there was no free wifi, it was $13/day, but when you only pay slightly more than $200/night for the room, it doesn't seem like such a bad deal.  Will stay here again.;4
My only complaint about the hotel is that the night we chose to stay they were testing the emergency generator at 1:00 am. We did not know this until we checked in after a 14 hour flight from Sydney. It was off until we left the hotel around 3:00 am to catch our flight home. We were unable to sleep once the electricity went out as my husband's cpap machine went off and the room started to get warm. When attempting to leave,  the first  shuttle van drove past us.;4
King deluxe rooms have a very comfortable bed and a great bathroom with plenty of light.  Expect loud street noise, so request a higher floor. Excellent location close to theaters, good restaurants and Central Park.;4
If you want to be across the street from Madison Square Garden, Macy's or Penn Station, this is a great option.  Make sure to request a refurbished room.  They are quite comfortable, albeit some are oddly shaped, because it's an older building.  We had a view of the Garden, and it was great.  The bathrooms are very small.;4
This was our first visit to the Empire Hotel.  We found that the staff went out of their way to be cheerful and accommodating.   The room and bathroom was inviting and well kept.  One nice touch was the hotel's umbrella for our use.  During our visit it really came in hand.;4
Rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good. Reception was polite and helpful. Near to Hollywood and attractions. Will definitely stay there again. Far from airport. No problems to food before 9 pm. Amenities and subway nearby.;4
Great experience. Great customer service. I had troubles opening the door and came downstairs for another room key. The front desk was very pleasant and sent security upstairs to ensure I was about to get inside. Definitely staying here again.;4
5-7 min walk to universal studios or Citywalk.   The walk isn't on the sidewalk the entire time, which isn't super safe.  You walk in the driveway around a curve.   Appears to be a shorter walk from the Hilton than from the Sheriton.  We didn't eat at the hotel, but walked past the buffet several times, it looked fantastic.   Bought 3 waters in the hotel store for $15!   Seriously overpriced.   Nice hotel, but the nightly rate seems high.  Obviously, the location allows them to price however they want.  If you have Hilton honors, you get free wifi.  I signed up for honors when I booked on the website ( free to join).;4
We have just come back from 3 night stay at this hotel and it was better than I had expected.   We booked the trip on a whim last minute, 2 days before going and were looking for something on a budget.  After booking I then went onto Trip Advisor and read the reviews and started to get a bit worried - what had I done?  What can I say?  Definately better than expected.  The hotel was clean and the staff friendly, ordering us a car to the airport and pointing us in the right direction for the Metro. Although this hotel is a little out of the way, the Metro station is 3 blocks away and the trains run fairly regularly (we waited no more than 5 minutes) and we could always get on them, even in rush hour.  This was a cheap way of getting around, costing $2 per trip, anywhere.  A taxi;4
This hotel is not retro it is the original!    Near a  Metro Station with a bus stop right in front it is convenient to  Universal Studios and Los Feliz, a trendy art  district where film crews are frequently seen.  An air of fifties Hollywood glamor remains in the details of this hotel. Stylized metal palm leaves, granite floors reminiscent of the Hollywood Stars at Graumans Chinese Theatre, interior balconies open to the stars and rooms updated with modern amenities and a comfortable bed made this hotel stay an unexpected pleasure.   The attractive landscaped pool area is a welcome place to cool off and relax.   The breakfast was plentiful including a waffle table with lots of juice and coffee. I appreciated the ceramic mugs in both the room and at breakfast instead of foam;4
Annual medical conference is at Hilton every November. Facility is always clean and friendly staff. I would recommend for a family Universal Stufios vacation since entrance is a short walk from hotel.;4
Yet again, I had an excellent time at The Jane. The location is perfect, the staff are friendly, and they have a new lift! YAY!!! The bathrooms, although shared are very clean and spacious. The rooms are tiny, but why would you spend your time indoors when the world (NYC) is just outside, ready to explore?;4
Nice hotel, staff were really nice and we were able to check in earlier than we expected. Which was great after being on a really long flight. Room was clean. Not a lot of places to eat near the hotel but there are some about 15mins walk. Good location if you're going to Universal like we did and it's close to the Metro.;4
I and my teenage son stayed there just 4 days ago for 2 nights visiting friends at LA.  The service was good- front desk was helpful and efficient,  the parking staff explained the options of parking very clearly, the room was clean and quiet even it is right by the airport, beds were comfortable and the Regency Club was as good as most clubs at Hyatt.  We took the very last flight home on the 3rd day so we stored our bags in the hotel and went back around 7 pm to retrieve our bags.  Everything was perfect as you could expect from a Hyatt Regency except- it's actually our own fault to leave my son's toiletry pouch behind in the bathroom.  He did not realize it until we arrived home late at night.  It is a clear pouch with his name and school name in big words taped in the front;4
The location is PERFECT, close to (time square). The staff is very friendly. The room is modern decorated, the bed is comfortable. The AC worked perfectly. The doorman are amazing, specially Jeff and Julian. The front desk staff is always available for good recommendations. The con is that the lobby has only one restroom which is not clean at all but not as dirty as well. I definitely recommend it for everyone going to NYC.;4
The location does this hotel wonders.  I've been to NYC many times and I absolutely love this city.  I chose this hotel because of its location.  It is close to pretty much everything!  The room was clean and noisy of course, but that's NYC.  The front desk was friendly, but this is the first hotel I've ever been in where they have a security check to make sure you have a key card for a room.  The hotel is always busy, and it is great for a short stay.  Would definitely come back!;4
If you are visiting the Universal Studios then you probably found the right hotel to stay at. It is just a 9 minute shuttle ride from the studios and the hotel provides that with their compliments all day. The staff are very helpful. Breakfast was above average for a buffet, but there are plenty of choices.;4
Room is tiny, that was no problem. Staff we nice. Worth staying if you're looking for cheap and safe. However the carpet in the halls feels like it holds the secrets to all the things the hotel has seen- it's really gross and I'm not usually that worried about a bit of grubbiness. Also it was noisy, with someone near my room sounding like they were either (mentally) unwell or off their head on something. When you're staying on your own as a woman and your head is right beside your bedroom door (because TINY room) both the noise and the sense of safety not being 100% was off putting. Location was very good. I probably wouldn't stay again, but that's mostly as I also stayed at a couple of home stay/bnb places and found them so good I'd stick to them in future. If I had to chose a;4
"I paid $81/night and got a double bed room on 3/10 and 3/11/06. When i arrived to check in, they only had me down for one night but thankfully i had a print out of my expedia confirmation. The staff called expedia and quickly resolved the issue with no problem.   The room was cheap for such a great, quiet location; there's a bus stop right in front of the hotel and there's a metro stop on 103rd st and 110th (the hotel is between 106th & 107th).  The staff was friendly and was more than happy to assist with any request. The rooms were tiny (i would NOT recommend this room for anyone expecting to spend a lot of time in their hotel room) and there was no closet, safe or comforters on the beds - but you're in new york city so why would you want to spend a lot of time cooped up in a";4
We arrived here on my 50th birthday and had put in our booking and had e mailed the hotel to ask if it would be possible to have a nice room with a view as it was my actual birthday. We arrived early morning as we had been on a cruise the week before and sailed into New York very early morning. Our room on arrival wasn't ready so we were invited to leave our cases where they would be securely stored in the hotel and told our room would be ready early afternoon. We then went out for a few hours sightseeing and returned around 3pm and told our room was ready. I expected to have a lovely room and maybe a bottle to celebrate with as I had read previous reviews on here where that had happened, unfortunately we got to our room which was really small, very dated and no bottle or;4
Arriving Saturday for a Sunday seminar, I found the Jane Hotel to be a more than pleasant surprise.It's location on a quanint cobblestone street lined with well maintained brownstones is charming. Front desk personnel were kind, professional and courteous. The gentleman on duty the evening I arrived was able to direct me to an excellent all night deli. My cabin style room, while small, was clean, well appointed, bath shoes and robe provided. The TV, lights, alarm clock and internet all worked fine.An underbed set of drawers were large enough to store my goods. A safe is also provided to lock important items when out of room .  One large window afforded me a view of the river and skyline. The shared bath was clean and neat. Renovations were underway in the lobby area (which by;4
"This hotel is positioned really well, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. You do have to pay a ""resort/property"" fee upon checking in, but the value for the location is quite good. Wi-fi throughout as well as pretty large fitness center in the basement of the hotel available for use. We checked in late at night due to our flight delays, we arrived around 2am and check in was easy.  We took the train into Manhattan from JFK to Penn Station without a problem. We were able to walk to our Boradway Shows, Times Square, Central Park without a problem. You can also take the subway easily and cheaply to all of these destinations as well as the rest of Manhatten and the boroughs.";4
The place is festive on the eyes. It's very inviting. My only disappointment was that the heat wasn't working in the room we booked. We were transferred to another. It was a cozy setting. I would recommend it to family & friends.;4
This is a great location if your planning to visit universal studios , it literally is a 6 minute walk or they run a shuttle bus every 15 mins . This is an older Hilton location they are starting to renovate but its OK . The staff are friendly and are working hard to cover the upgrade work that's going on. As a gold member i got free breakfast voucher but be aware that's only for a continental platter . If you want the full buffet you will need to shell out another $9 per head. Noe about my comment on overlooking Universal Studios , it was sold to us as an upgrade. Truth is there is a lot of construction going on in the park and they do most of it when the park is closed ( between 10pm and 9am) . So all we heard all night was trucks and diggers and pile drivers and we were on;4
I stayed here March 10-14th..It was my second time in NYC, this time I traveled with my 11 year old son.   We found this hotel through this website which directed us to Bookit.com.  We paid a mere $79 a night for this gem!!!  The hotel is in a residental neighborhood right across the street from Central Park, it is no where near Midtown/Times Square, but that is not a problem since there is a subway three blocks away!!  As for dining options there is a deli two blocks away that serves great coffee and  delicious bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwiches, as well as other breakfast favs.  Crepes on Columbus, about 3 blocks down, is also a great dining option.  The neighborhood also has small shops as well as several produce stands and food carts.  The rooms arent in the best shape,;4
You're well taken care of at the Empire. The only thing tat stopped this from being a five star review was the strong smell of chlorioin our room. Granted we were very close to the pool and the smell faded quickly but it wasn't the warm welcome we imagined. Otherwise the room was lovely, the view of Lincoln Center made me not want to sleep. In fact my roommate didn't but instead spent most of the night eating pizza on the fountains edge.  We lounged in the lobby bar, roomy with super comfy couches.  We hit a few snags in our travel plans and the folks at the Empire made it seem lime  lucky break.  Check out the little restaurant next door too, friendly bar tender and great crowd, we ended every night there.;4
This Hilton is situated just steps from the entrance to Universal Studios, though it is also very close to the freeway and easy to get to other sites in Hollywood and Los Angeles. I am a Diamond member so I stay at Hilton properties almost weekly. I do not like paying for parking, but it is standard for many full-size Hilton hotels. Also, you will pay for internet as well unless you are a Diamond member, so I got lucky there, although I don't understand why a Hampton Inn offers free wi-fi. I found the hotel to be clean, quiet, and with a friendly, attentive staff. The buffet breakfast is vast and great, though not cheap (you get what you pay for).;4
Stayed two nights just to go to Universal.  Check in and out was smooth.  Room was comfortable and clean.  Ate at the bar the first night since the restaurant was closing as we checked in.  Food was pretty good, and staff very nice.  Would stay again if going to Universal due to 5 minute walk to park and shops.;4
I stayed at this hotel for two nights. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. I had an issue with my heat and the maintenance man, Durjodnan Tickaram came immediately and fixed it. We even discovered that there was an issue with the window which he resolved as well. I would stay here again next time I need to come into the city.;4
The Rooms were small and we got a smoking floor by accident so stay away from those. but the decor was updated , the bed was comfy and the Zebra Chair was kind of fun. Overall for manhattan not bad.  we got a deal on trip advisor and it was well worth it.;4
I was staying here with a friend and we were having trouble finding things to do in the city because the weather was pretty poor (lots of rain) so we went to guest services and the manager Nicole was very helpful.  She recommended that we speak to the concierge and he was also very helpful.  He recommended museums and let us know pricing and hours of operation.  Overall we wouldn't of had the same experience without them.  Very helpful right when we needed help!;4
Staff was friendly and helped us so much.  Many guests, many from other countries, didn't respect the no smoking policy.  They would stand just outside the hotel to smoke.  Staff helped with that.  Nice rooms and good breakfast.  Expensive, but in the area, everything is.;4
Great location - was convenient to every where we wanted to go either via Lyft or Subway - The rooms are in decent shape and the staff is friendly ( in a NY kind of way ) only downfall is that the pool is way smaller than depicted on line and the Roof Top Bar seems to gear more toward outside guest than hotel guest but otherwise great place to stay;4
Fairly small hotel in a great location. Situated easy walking distance between Central Park and Times Square. Free tea or coffee is a welcome service. Staff very helpful, especially Jeff who has been a Doorman/Concierge for many years. Feels like home away from home.;4
Nice but noisy hallways. Doors constantly slamming all night.   Comfortable bed. Nice shower. Plenty of hot water. Good for an overnight stay. Decent price.    Hallway decor is disgusting. Loud and distracting.;4
Came here for my 21st, room was upgraded at no extra cost! Great central location, very close to Times Square and within walking distance to other attractions such as Central Park and the Empire State Building. Very clean, staff were all very friendly greeting at the door and in the lobby. Jeff the doorman was particularly helpful to us when looking at booking our transport home and was very approachable if we had any questions. He was always happy to help and had a genuine love of providing excellent customer service! Thank you for a great stay!;4
In town for a family wedding. We got a great group rate.  Everything was wonderful except the bathroom which needed updating and general maintenance. It was difficult to keep the room comfortable as the heat pump doesn't have a thermostat.;4
We got a great deal at this hotel,of 200.00 dollars per night and it was well worth it. The location is great, close to subway and restaurants. I was traveling. With two children and my husband  and the room was very small, but who cares when you in NY you spend very little time in the room. The hotel bar was CRAZY expensive and the breakfast was too....all in all I would recommend this hotel for sure...;4
Overall we were happy with the hotel.  Nice and easy to get around the city from the hotel whether walking or by using the tube with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby.   Descent sized comfortable room, clean and tidy.  As stated by others the staff were friendly.  It took a bit of getting use to the prices of things in New York with 10 dollars for a bottled of beer in the bar a bit stiff compared to back home but it was comparable to elsewhere.  The bar was usually lively and a good place to spend an hour or so to relax after a hard days sightseeing.;4
I reserved a Superior One room with a private bath for two weeks.  I arrived early and Patrick helped me store my luggage and graciously directed me to the local eateries.  The room was clean, simple and straightforward.  The bathroom was spotless and the refrigerator incredibly helpful as I was on a budget and needed to get groceries instead of eating out.  Room was reliably cleaned daily.  I attended the Columbia University Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project and walked to school everyday.  The hotel is two buildings away from corner of Broadway and the metro and busses going to every part of the city were at most, three blocks away.  Central Park is also within walking distance.  The hotel is located on the 1 train route, so I could get downtown, midtown or to the;4
good hotel but slow internet and a small elevators, but The location of this Hotel was superb very near to the metro station, near to a lot of restaurants, staff were very good and helpful nice bathroom;4
Decent hotel, great rate, excellent location, room was small but efficient (its Manhattan!!).  Columbus circle is a great central location, especially if weather is decent!  Would stay here again.........;4
Having booked the hotel on the spur of the moment  I was a little concerned by some of the critical reviews that I read. I am pleased to say that my concern was unnecessary and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay.Firstly the staff were very friendly,helpfuland professional even when faced with my dopey questions all of which were answered quickly.     The decor of the hotel is far from plush which might concern those to whom this is important however personally I found it to be clean and tidy. Our room was adequate in size and comfortable certainly larger than I expected having read some reviews .There isn't much closet space however we were content to operate out of suitcases which worked very well.The bathroom was a decent size and well cleaned (as was room ) every day.We also had;4
I stayed here in August with my son. Tiny room, but excellent quiet area. Staff was great.;4
This hotel is right next to the 94th/broadway street entrance to the subway. This was really convenient for us, as was the pharmacy next door and the choices of restaurants within walking distance.  The people at the front desk were polite and helpful, if understaffed during busy times.  I had booked a non-smoking double but the front desk gave us a free upgrade to a business double. The room was immaculate, wasn't cramped, had a neat view, and everything worked except the room safe.  We had to let the water run for a while in the tub in order for the hot water to start, but once it got going we had nice hot showers.  The heater was occasionally noisy but I normally pack earplugs since as a country girl the street noises in cities keep me awake.  And boy were there noises at;4
If you are planning a trip to see Universal Studios you need to consider this hotel. I just visited today and was very pleased with my room and the service I received. The 15th floor gives you a beautiful view of LA and the corner rooms give the appearance of more space. The king size bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. The tv had a very nice picture and I thought the remote was very nice and modern. You will also have some fancy water in the room which was actually not a bad price for the Pelligrino and the other water. I do like that they have an outlet right next to the bed near the tv so you can iron and still watch tv. I took a photo for you to see the view from the west side of the hotel. The other side of the hotel will give you a view of Universal;4
Nice hotel with great bar and buffet in lobby.  Newly renovated rooms. Very convenient if you are going to Universal Studios and City Walk.  Just a short walk across the street.  Valet or self park.  Self park charge was around $20.00 a day which I thought was a little pricey.  Also, they charge $7.95 a day for WiFi in your room.  Would have gave 5 stars if it wasn't for those two inconveniences.;4
Checked In by Pasqule at the front desk.  He was very nice and and went above and beyond for me, created a wonderful experience as the face of the empire.     The location is amazing with great restaurants and Lincoln center at your doorstep. Only issues I had was the room air conditioner did not work very well and the rooftop pool was closed in July!;4
Less then 10 mins from the subway on the river. The bathroom has a view of the Statue of Liberty. Bunk rooms are small  and bathroom is shared - but perfectly adequate for the budget traveller. Close to Chelsea markets and plenty of restaurants in the west village;4
"The hotel is beautifully decorated in Art Deco Style. Staff is friendly and helpful and security is very good. You have to show your key card to get to the elevators. Eight years ago, my sister and I were there with a tour from Road Scholar. We had a spacious, beautifully decorated room and bath. This year, still with Road Scholar, we had a tiny room and bath. Bathroom tile needed replacing or regrouting, black grout, yuck.  Had to edge my way between the foot of the bed and the tv stand/dresser to a place under the window where I could open my suitcase. ONE, I repeat ONE convenient. available electric outlet to charge electronics. My sister crawled under the ""desk"" to get to the only other one we could find. There was an outlet in the bathroom but the shelf was only wide enough";4
The hotel is old and small, but very nicely decorated. The lounge is wonderful. There are a lack of tables in the room so if you need to do work and lay out papers it is a bit annoying. The room lighting is also poor (ie: a corner of the room I was in basically had no lights near it). Their Internet payment system is horrible, it is slow and crashes. It processed my payment and then basically crashed so I never got an access code. Luckily the front desk staff were nice enough to give me their lobby password so I had free Internet the entire time I was there. The rooftop bar closes too early (10pm).  Other than that the hotel itself was very comfortable, especially the bed. The washroom is very nice, but the design is a bit awkward and impractical. The hotel is also very quiet,;4
No experience of other hotels in NY - but this met our needs for a long weekend. Room reasonably large (2 twin bed) - clean. Good bar. Cold breakfast buffet good - hot breakfast buffet far too expensive. Disorganized breakfast service - menu items took far too long. Overheard manager telling guests that they could not provide a boiled egg. However the location and reasonable level of dÃ©cor overrides these niggles. As other have said - bring your own bottled water!;4
Future will be choosing this place to stay for long holiday. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the friendly reception staff, she makes our trip more interesting with her advice & tips about the city ,supermarket ,shops,restaurants are within walking distance. Would definitely recommend this hotel to everybody! It's a true sample of excellent hospitality.;4
Stayed two nights in Jan 2016 in order to fill up on some Broadway shows before heading off to Europe.  A unique hotel in a great location near the Village.  A short(ish), convenient walk to the subway.  Leaving this hotel each morning and walking though the residential area helped me feel more like a real New Yorker instead of a tourist.  Neighbourhood felt safe at all times.  I booked a single room and discovered on my first night that I had a roommate - a sly cockroach trying to share the room with me.  I booted him out and didn't see anymore during my stay, thankfully.  They stored my bag for me when I checked out in the morning but didn't need to catch my flight until late afternoon. No real complaints at all.  I have already booked to stay again on my return visit later;4
I like this upper west side hotel for its' terrific location.  Across the street from the Lincoln Center with five very good restaurants near by and near enough to several museums.   Yes, the rooms are small.  You are in NYC, what are you doing in your room? But they are priced appropriately for the size of the room.   The street view is lovely, but can be a tad noisy.  The rooms at the back of the hotel are more quiet.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  A good value for a nice hotel in a great location.;4
Walking into the lobby it looks great. Very modern looking and we were helped immediately. The front desk clerk asked what our visit was for and once she found out it was my husband's birthday and his first time in New York she offered us a bottle of complimentary Champagne in our room even though my husband doesn't drink I figured it would at least be great for me. Once we got on the elevator and made it to our room we could tell the hotel had some remodeling and upgrading to do. The room was extremely small from any hotel I have ever been in and there was no refrigerator. The view wasn't the greatest either. I immediately called the lobby to see if there was an upgrade room or at least one with a refrigerator. She told me that they would possibly have a slightly bigger room;4
I found the Hyatt Regency near LAX to be very clean with relatively new furnishings and facilities.  It is very convenient to LAX if you are returning a rental car (only about a mile away).  I was not impressed with the lobby bar (chilly and not well-appointed).  I also think a hotel should provide their guests with free (non-valet) parking which this Hyatt did not do.  Overall, though, I thought this Hyatt was a very good experience.;4
Stayed here one night in July for a business trip.  Overall this is a good hotel with an excellent location proximity to LAX.  Rooms are clean and staff is friendly.  My only issue was a complete lack of any towels in the fitness room.  It's tough to clean-up when dripping with sweat using paper towels from the sink dispenser.;4
A Good hotel to stay for a few days. Not a luxury hotell but good for you to sleep. ItÂ´s ok because when you visit New York you usually return to hotel just to sleep. Thinking about that, for me itÂ´s ok.   The rooms are small. I had to upgrade my room because it was sooo small and I was with my mom.   The best point to evaluate your choice is the location, which is near the Madison Squate Garden.  I truly recommend.;4
we booked the hotel thru travelchannel.de Price was 153 per night which is a bargain compared to hotels like the Pennsilvania or other old places. For the first night we had a very tiny room with window to the backyard. But upon request room was changed the next day to a bigger room with park view. Both rooms  and Bathrooms very very clean. Tv was not working properly, but they are working to improve the system. And there is more things to do in NYC than watching television. Staff was very attentive and helpful.  We would  always go back there.;4
"Reasonable midtown hotel convenient to Penn Station, the subway lines.  There may not be a more convenient location in the city.   Like other Wyndham hotels, this is not as bad as the bad reviews nor as good as the top reviews. First the gripes: Now way this is a four star.  No real sense of service, always a mobbed front lobby, aged hallways, small rooms with no coffee makers or bathroom shelf space, old tub fixtures and huge ""facility"" fee. Mandatory $34.08 per day for ""free"" internet, gym and business center.  So you're getting a 3 star (maybe 3.5 on a good day) hotel for well over 2 Benjamins a day.   The better part: Redone lobby with several restaurants and bars attached. A mildly interesting museum on the when this was a grand hotel. The fixtures in the bedroom and bath,";4
It was our first time in NYC and we found that The New Yorker met our needs for our 3 night stay.   Pros: It is directly across the street from Penn Station which made it easy to take the train to/from JFK and Newark Airports. It is also walking distance to a ton of tourists attractions, as well as a straight shot 15-ish minutes to lower Manhattan via the subway. Our room had a âmetroâ view from the 25th floor which was perfect. We could clearly see the Hudson River and a wide view of the surrounding buildings below and across from us. The staff was friendly and accommodating.   Cons: The hotel could use some cosmetic upgrades - in the room bathrooms specifically. The bathtub was stained and looked dirty. I wiped it down thinking it hadnât been cleaned, but turns out it just had;4
Ameritania was great, you can walk to most attractions from here or get in the subway and explore the city.. all theatres are very close, and times square was really close too. We had a great stay in here;4
First of all, I was a little skeptical after reading some reviews. However we had an amazing stay. The hotel was exactly what we needed it for â it was clean and the room was quiet at night for much needed sleep after exploring everyday. I never found anyone at the front desk rude, in fact everyone was so friendly, polite and helpful. I asked for a print out of a map pretty much everyday (sent it to their email) and they were more than happy to print out my information. I think if you are nice, then you will be treated accordingly.   Maid service everyday was great â our room was clean and we had fresh towels every day and clean sheets every 2/3 days. Our room was quiet and I didnât have any trouble sleeping. I, in fact, called up and requested a room on the 3rd floor that;4
Room was just right for 4, plush and modern.  Restaurant in lobby looked upscale. Walking distance to attractions, would stay again for the convenience to citywalk and studios.  Parking fee, internet fee.;4
The front desk staff were very good, especially Mohammed as he gave us a free upgrade to a great suite with amazing panoramic views of the city! We could see the empire statue building and Chrysler Building, also partial views of Times Square and the Hudson River, all from our room, this was particularly amazing during storm Jonas! Good location with plenty of food places nearby. Good wifi.;4
The New Yorker has an impressive lobby full of helpful people. We had a room that overlooked the Empire State Building. It had 2 double beds, a desk, and a small dresser. It's smaller than most hotel rooms I've stayed in but location is important here. The bathroom is small with very little space to put your things like make up down on, but there is a small ledge. The Tick Tock Diner is downstairs. They are always open and have good food for breakfast.;4
There were two things that kept this from being a near perfect stay. The bed was hard as a rock and the robes are only large enough for a large child. The service was excellent and I loved the location. Really a fantastic hotel, but they have to spend some money on new comfy mattress' and some adult size robes.;4
Had a great view of the city from my room. The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you want 2 bathrooms in your suite you need to ask for it upon arrival or during the reservation period. 1 block from Penn Station which was great. close to Time Square and other sites.;4
Having stayed in Easy hotels in London I am used to tiny rooms, but this was better for a single traveler as there was plenty of room under the bed for my bags. The A/C worked fine as felt comfortable despite the boiling heat outside. It was a little noisey but it was easier to get used to than the heat.  The shared shower and toilets were good, always clean and never busy when I needed either as there was 2 of each. The big downside was the elevator was broken down when I checked in and and when I checked out although the staff were willing to carry my bag if needed, and even when working it seemed slow. There was a nice cafe I don't know if it is a part of the hotel but you do access it from the hotel. Served nice food and drink with friendly service. Great location if;4
It is a good hotel close to everything, the attention was very nice, especially from Julian, the only detail, was an annoying noise in the wall of the bathroom which was annoying to sleep.  Everything else was very good.;4
We arrived at this hotel in the middle of the night (actually, it was closer to morning).  Our 6 hours flight was delayed, our luggage took an hour to retrieve, and there was a problem with the rental car. So when we walked into the Hilton, I expected another problem.  I was thrilled when we were kindly greeted and quickly checked in.  One problem that was immediately taken care of was our rental car.  We were automatically upgraded to a larger vehicle, but it was so large it did not fit in self-parking.  The valet took our car and parked it for us at no additional charge.  This was such a nice gesture after a long trip.  The room was spacious and clean.  The bathroom was a great size, which we really needed on this trip (we have two teenage daughters). The beds and pillows were;4
We've stayed here several times before and always enjoyed our visits.   Free breakfast is great with very friendly and helpful staff, Sonia and Oralia served us today and made great omelettes.   The hotel is clean and tidy even with the latest improvements happening.   I'll agree with the cost of the hotel parking, it's too pricy for us at $22 per day would cost us $154 for our total stay, we use street parking but make sure you watch out for street cleaning!   The bedrooms lovely and clean although a bit cool for us as it's on the courtyard side of the building.   We will definitely be back at the hotel.;4
We stayed 3 nights and the check in receptionist was extremely helpful as our party of 4 wanted rooms on the same floor.  Lovely foyer, with a capable Italian restaurant on one side and a 24 hour diner on the other.   The staff were always very helpful, and we called out help when the battery failed on the safe in the room.  The man came immediately and sorted it out with the minimum of fuss, and actually apologised for asking me to try it to make sure it now worked.  Our room was adequate and always clean but it has seen better days.;4
It takes more than location, nice beds and a reasonable price to make a great hotel. It takes a friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. The Empire has it all !! At the front door you are greeted by Eugene, Brian, Denis, Chris, Denise, Naz, Jose, Brendan (Depending on the hour and the day). At the front desk Maggie relieves any concern that this will be a wonderful stay. She is warm, experienced and even if she is overwhelmed with customers she makes you feel that you are the only one. guest.;4
People who goes to NYC and don't wanna spend money in hotel, this one is a good choice. It's simple, small, comfortable, clean and the staff is helpful. An old man on our first morning receipted us with a good morning in our language. That was really great and cool.  There's no luxury, but it's secure. The internet connection is paid, but it's great, in a city that you won't find a lot of places with good free wi-fi.  Nearby metro stations (110th), in front of Central Park, it's located in a residential area, that have a lot of babies schools. Crossing the park you will be in the 5th Avenue.;4
This past December me and my two daughter's stayed at Morningside Inn on the upper west side of Manhattan. This made the 6th or 7th time we have stayed here. It is a great place if you are watching your pennies. It is a hostel, so no mints on your pillow, but it is very clean, safe and Patrick and his staff are wonderful. The neighborhood is very safe, and it has a lot of great restaurants within walking distance and is very close to Columbia University. Also it is only a couple of blocks from the Subway and less than a block from the bus. Would highly recommend it to anyone!!;4
The staff were friendly (apart from the Starbucks barista in the lobby!). The room was always very clean. The bathroom could have been in better condition, it was showing signs of age.  The pool was a good size and the staff were very attentive.  A pleasant stay with good people. Oh, and the hotel bar was not too expensive!;4
The hotel is well located just steps away from Penn station and a few blocks from Time Square !! friendly staff and clean rooms. that's all I need when it comes to a place I want to stay !! Also just 5 blocks away from the Edge;4
Staying with children (8 & 6) in the Empire is absolutely no problem at all. We had a great time during our 8 days NYC. They were threated like a little prins and princess. Who doesn't like that? The staf is friendly, the room clean and that's what's most important to us. The location for exploring the city is excellent. We absolutely come back as soon as we visit New York again!;4
The location on the upper West Side is excellent - right by Lincoln Center, Starbucks and a 24/7 convenience store.  The personnel at the hotel are excellent and exceeded my expectations.  However...there were two of us in the room for four nights,  When we got to the room, we found a  Keurig machine, four paper cups,  6 Keurig cups - 3 coffee, two tea, one hot chocolate and a packet with sugar, cream sweetener and stir rods for two cups. The paper cups were replenished daily, but nothing else.  When I asked at the desk on the third morning, I was told the Keurig cups initially provided were gratis, but any more would be $3.00 each!  We were astounded at the cheapness!  Thank goodness there was a Starbuck's next door.;4
This was a convenient place for us to stay and self-parking next door only cost around $15 a night. What a bargain for LA! The beds were very comfortable tho we had some water pressure probs. Hated the decor but that's minor. Food tastes good and pretty reasonably priced (for a hotel);4
The Front Desk staff and Manager were very nice, professional and made me feel welcome as a valued guest at this hotel. The Trattoria Bianca has some of the best dinner meal specials with variety. The Italian Shepherd's Pie was absolutely delicious. During our business stay, we took advantage of many of the amenities. The New Yorker would be my number one choice when I return to visit NYC, based on prime location, classy hotel, good food and safety.;4
I really enjoy this hotel. It's in an ideal location for the city, close to the park and near the red subway line. The neighborhood is great. Often when I stay they upgrade my room. Luis was a big help last time.;4
Staff is friendly and helpful.  Rooms are clean and cozy.  Just an absolute wonderful spot for a couples  stay.  I want to give a shout out to Mouhrad, very helpful and friendly.  Thanks for all the advice for a couple on our first trip to NYC!!  Would definitely stay here again!!;4
"Quick access to clean, modernised, spacy rooms (beginning of the afternoon). Our room had an airport view, so we did see the airplanes flying in and away, but we didn't hear them in the room fortunately.  Breakfast is a joy: good, plenty, healthy and tasty buffet, kind waiters brought us as much drinks as we wanted, and breakfast was included for our children as well. Tip: include breakfast in your booking because buying food and drinks in the hotel is expensive, and we didn't see shops or groceries nearby.  Childen were very happy with the fast WiFi. Ubers arrived quickly and brought us everywhere we wanted in LA from this hotel. Big, clean, warm swimming pool, and as it is outside: free airport noise and smell  (-; Free Airport shuttle, though the driver didn't tell us at";4
It appears the hotel finally figured out how to stop the shower flooding with redesigning the shower space with a little wall.  or maybe I just got a lucky room this time.  Either way, no flooding this time. Love the atmosphere at the property and for the price, it is an NYC deal!   Employees are super helpful and nice. Love the apples at the front desk and special black/white cookies I get when I check in.;4
I really enjoyed my stay at the Hollywood Hotel.  The Pro's: 1) Breakfast buffet. Scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, cereal (cheerios, rice crispy & corn flakes) Milk, Lemonade, Orange Juice. Toast (very varieties of bread) Coffee (Only powdered creamer & milk) sugar & sweetener plus fruits. The times from 6:30 to 10:30 is perfect.  2) I loved my double queen room. The one slight change I would make would be to move the sofa away from the microwave and refrigerator. The coffee pot they have in the room holds a single cup. You cannot see the TV from there. The bathroom is spacious to me. Be very careful of walking into as you turn the water on. The hot water takes about 4 to 5 minutes to heat up. I was impressed that they use low flow toilets. I didn't have a single problem with;4
I liked the Hotel, very pleasant staff and nice hotelroom. The breakfast was a bit Meh, at least the continental breakfast. The room was alot more spacious than I first thought, and for the location it was very affordable for a 4 night stay!;4
Great place to stay right where you need to be to do the sights. Staff where all great and couldnât do enough for us, sorted our taxis as well. Its an old place so the rooms are a bit small, but its clean and well kept. Would most definitely stay again.;4
One of my writers' organizations had a conference here, and the hotel was a good choice It would also have been a good choice for a family visiting Universal Studios.. Our room was large, with a very large bathroom by modern hotel standards. On my way to the conference every morning, I walked by a large breakfast buffet at the restaurant. It looked tempting, but the conference was providing breakfast. The buffet did spill out into the hallway leading to the ballrooms, making it somewhat hard to get past.  Past the restaurant is a Peet's Coffee where my husband got us iced latte in the mornings--and a good muffin on our last day before leaving for the airport. I have been to many hotel where they asked you to save water by using your towels more than one day. This is one of the;4
Iâll start by saying I found absolutely nothing wrong with my stay.   Its an older hotel, with great location and a good value.   Its an older property, Things are kept up but you can see the age on them.   Its clean but weathered.   Thereâs nothing fancy about this place.;4
Stayed here during November 2015 and was very impressed. The Hotel is classy and clean. The room was beautiful, beds were comfy, and the staff were friendly. The breakfast provided downstairs was great - cereal, toast, fruit and omelettes & eggs cooked however you wish. The hotel is a minute or two walk to the train station which will take you into the tourist area of Hollywood. Lovely.;4
Arrived at the hotel tired after a long haul flight. I didnât research how to get to the hotel, and ended up walking from the subway/train station. Itâs not too far but gee that hill gets you as you tow a suitcase. Found out later there was a shuttle. The location to the universal studios is fantastic, and thereâs plenty of places to eat.  The room was large and clean. It was very comfortable. The checkin was easy nothing was too much. The restaurant was a little expensive but it was lovely food. Although I would stay here again, it is a fair distance from Downtown LA, and we spent time travelling.;4
"Lovely lobby and rooms,   Very friendly and helpful staff,  Room furniture a bit awkward, as it was hard to find anywhere big enough to place my suitcase.  Bath mirror sticks out far; I bumped my head on it coming up from the sink.  Furniture drawers didn't stay closed.  Comfy bed, nice view.  Don't eat the peanuts' they're rotten.  Great location";4
This was our second visit to the Empire after staying at many other hotels in the city in different areas. We love the location and if you happen to get a room with views they are stunning! The rooftop has great views as well. The vibe of the hotel is cool and we've always had friendly service. The beds are comfortable, showers have great water pressure and the room is clean. The biggest negative is the size of the bathrooms. Even for NY standards they are ridiculously small. We were in a superior king room this time and the space is pretty tight with not much room to put your belongings and feel comfortable. The hotel is starting to look worn and in need of updates. The elevators were painfully slow. We have a love/hate relationship with this hotel.;4
We stayed at the Empire hotel for 6 nights over the Christmas period. This was our first time visiting New York - the hotel entrance and lobby was beautiful and the lobby bar was also lovely. Our room was very clean and the staff were helpful, providing us with information and letting us use the reception phones to order food and book excursions. We didnât have any view out of our bedroom window (only to the wall opposite) however we hardly spend any time in the room - so this wasnât too much of an issue. The location was great, lots of local shops and restaurants and only a 15/20 minute walk to Times Square and 5 minutes to Central Park - we would definitely recommend!Also no taxes/charges to pay for this hotel (only the mini bar if you use it);4
"All within 20 steps from the hotel: A major subway station Hertz car rental Starbucks, McD, Subway Thai, japanese, indian restaurants  The hotel itself is pretty old, and we found the room to be slightly cramped, but it was the best value. We thought that this location would be too far from the ""action"" of NYC but it wasn't at all.";4
"I don't really have a lot to say, it was a clean room with a balcony, really quiet room, beds were comfortable and i am prone to bites when staying in hotel beds and I didn't get one, lovely hotel. The breakfast was really surprising as it was a wide choice and variety; waffles, omelettes, pastries, bread, ham, cheese, bacon, sausage, juices, water, tea and coffee, really impressed and tasty. I would say that the hotel was in a good location but it is well known that you need a car to get around to see things which we did so we only left the hotel in the car.   we didn't spend much time in the hotel and i wish we had chance to try out the steam room and swimming pool but we didn't find the time. we stayed there two nights and paid Â£62 per night plus roughly $18 for parking per";4
The hotel was the perfect location for going to an event at Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle area.  Most people tend to stay mid-town it down, this is a great hotel to stay so you venture and see what you have been missing.;4
"During my visit to NYC my reservation was incorrect and I was over charged. Neida corrected my reservation before my arrival and informed her manager Micheal of the charge error. Micheal immediately refunded the money. Thanks I really appreciated the A+ service; they really redeemed my relationship with Wyndham!!!";4
We stayed at the Empire Hotel for 5 nights in a Superior Double Room. The hotel's location is perfect. It's only a short walk away from Central Park (5 mins) where you will also find a Metro station (Columbus Circle). There are lots of cafes, restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood. There is a Starbucks in the same hotel building. The hotel service was flawless. All staff were friendly at all times. The receptionist even gave us a voucher for free Wifi access valid during our entire stay after we had complained about the outrageous rates they were going to charge us. We very much liked the hotel bar. Nice and cosy atmosphere. The hotel features a small gym with three treadmills and some weights. There are no windows in this room and it does get a bit warm and humid whilst;4
it was a great stay. it was very nice for what we paid. the staff was very kind, especially Hugo and Elvira, who served us a great complimentary breakfast of custom omelettes. The location is pretty good, near a lot of great food.;4
The staff is helpful, friendly, and easily offers suggestions for activities, dining and transportation. The beds are heaven and I really appreciated having a makeup mirror in the bathroom. I only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant, but the food and service were both delightful. The location is excellent for Universal Studios and City Walk. I think the views are great from all the rooms. Was surprised Wifi was not free, and missed having a soda machine on the floor.;4
Great place.. stayed here many, many times..will stay again..the staff is super friendly and extremely helpful..location is perfect.. close to great shopping, restaurants and the Lincoln Center.. Central Park is a block away..;4
Older hotel near north-east corner of 84th & Broadway. Very convenient location. Near Columbia U. Plenty of restaurant options.  One bank of elevators not in service while I was there.  I had no problem but you may have to wait if you have a large party or lots of luggage. Ask for a renovated room;4
We had read other travellers reviews and were quite worried about staying here. However i was plesantly surprised with this hotel. The room we had had the most fantstic view of the city. The beds were really comfortable, the room was clean, bathroom cleaned daily. The staff were very friendly, any problems we had were dealt with immediately. Lifts worked well. Hotel organised cabs for return flight, standard fee $65 to Newark.. Lovely area, away from the hustle and bustle but so easy to get into the city, minutes walk to the subway. We used 103rd. Felt very safe at all times of the day.  Saved a great deal staying here. Fantastic if all you want is a clean comfortable bed to sleep in, most of your other time should be spent out exploring the city there is just so much to see and;4
Yes, the rooms are small. The bunkbed rooms are big enough to manage two bags in the corner under the window. There is some extra storage room under the beds and some hooks for towels or shirts.  Maybe not ideal if you are spending a week or more in the city, but for a couple of days this is might be the best value for money. Shared bathrooms are clean and i never had to wait for any to be available. Bunkbeds are good but could do with new matresses. Atmosphere and location are great! Just around the corner are the riverbank, bars/restaurants and beergardens and the subwaytrain.;4
The hotel is perfectly located to get around NYC and explore - and very reasonably priced. Jeff was super helpful on our first day giving us advice and tips on what to do each day which we took onboard! The hotel itself is clean and our room was great - very comfy bed. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that when on lower floors (we were on level 3) that the noise from the street is quite loud, so if you can request a room on a higher floor I would!;4
Having stayed in a number of ridiculously tiny-yet-still-expensive NYC hotels over the years, I was very pleased to have discovered the Empire. Just off Columbus Circle, with an amazing rooftop bar and swimming pool, I think this hotel offers very good value for money.  My room was a decent enough size - the view from the window wasn't great, but I'm not sure what people expect in a city famed for it's high rise skyscrapers. Chances are, you are going to be looking at the wall of the building next to you. If you want a fabulous view - you need to be prepared to pay mega bucks.   The hotel lobby bar is very good, and I hadn't realised until the last day of my stay that Wifi is free access in the lobby, but if you want it in your room - you have to pay for it! So if you want to;4
"Even though LAX is hopping this time of year, the Hyatt proved to be a very pleasant place to spend the night before an early flight.  Our room was very quiet and extremely comfortable.  The shuttle got us to our terminal in less than five minutes, but that was at 6am; LAX gets much busier later in the day.  Plan a little extra time if you have a lot of luggage.  The hotel is fairly large so you might have to walk a bit to your room.";4
Stayed here for 4 nights in August and it was a very good vacation. Hotel is located 2 blocks from Central Park and is approximately 15 minute walk to time square. Less foot traffic and much much cheaper than staying right in the centre. Very nice room with king bed and nice roof top bar, only major issue was the bathroom was extremely tiny, I don't need much room to get ready but it was a struggle to shower or do anything in there. Would also skip the lobby bar as cocktails are very expensive. Besides that I would gladly stay there again.;4
Reservations, check in, and assistance during our stay was great. My family spent Saturday night there after the day and next day at Universal Studios.   There is renovation occurring so front desk is a small area and not all elevators working. But check in went smooth and fast and we didn't wait for an elevator any longer than normal.  I bought coffee and the Peet's coffee downstairs along with fruit and two breakfast burritos. All of it was excellent. The shuttle service to the park is easy, quick, and frequent.  Every staff was extremely helpful.;4
Hollywood hotel has everything you need for your holiday: excellent location ( a few subway stops crom either Hollywood walk of fame/Universal Studios or Downtown LA), spacious and comfortable rooms, a great staff and a very good breakfast service. All of these pros and at a really cheap price. We stayed there for a week during our holidays and we gotnothing to complaint about. We made the right choice. Totally recommended!;4
Located near Universal Studios with paid parking garage. Lobby is spacious and nice enough but I wont say it is luxurious. Quick and welcoming check-in process. I like that they have a watering station outside the hotelâs gift shop to refill your water bottle and the water is cold and it tastes really good! Bellman Noli is so friendly, approachable and helpful in giving information about the area.   Room on the 24th. floor is spacious and it has fantastic views of the surrounding area including Universal Studios. Comfortable bed and pillows, large screen tv, small refrigerator, spacious bathroom, thick towels, what else could you ask for?   We had dinner reservation for their famous Saturday evening buffet but upon seeing the restaurant the day before that it has so many tables;4
Stayed here a few days while enjoying the city.  It's a good location, very close to central park, Starbucks right on the corner, places to shop and eat a few blocks away. Staff was courteous and helpful. It's probably on the edge of needing a good remodel though. Room had a bit of a musty smell.;4
The hotel is kind of dark but very stylish. Staff is very helpfull especially one concierge who mads for us a hell of a day. Food in the restaurant is good aswell, rooms are kind of small but thats Nyc;4
Great location, fun atmosphere.  Rooms and bathrooms are small, but typical for NYC.  Chris, the concierge, was awesome!!! He went above and beyond to make our stay extra special for my daughters 18th birthday.  Will definitely return to this hotel.   Close to subways and Central Park.;4
Nice hotel and friendly staff, rooms are good but the bathrooms are just a little dated but very clean and well maintained.  What makes this hotel perfect is the location.  Slap bang in the middle of everything and right next to penn station.  Great little dinner underneath give it a try. Would happily stay again;4
Great location if you're going to Universal Studios.  Walk-ability to city walk provides ample access to great affordable food.  Minor downsides: selection of children's TV channels is limited, TV remote is TERRIBLE and frustrating to use, electronic cellphone room key never worked.  Lobby layout is a little annoying.    Overall, very nice hotel with nice clear rooms and courteous staff.  This is all about location.;4
Stayed here for two days whilst visiting universal with my family. Good location if you are visiting the theme parks as it is a five minute walk away. The hotel itself is nice although they are doing a lot of building work whilst we were there so the gym was not accessible and the main lobby was closed off. We had breakfast one morning it was nothing special but had a decent selection of hot and cold buffet food. I would recommend for a short stay at universal, if you want to visit any of the other sights in Hollywood it is a drive away.;4
Our room was great! Beds were very comfortable & the staff was friendly. It is an awesome location... very close to Madison Square Garden (where we were seeing a concert that night) & Macyâs... and walking distance to Times Square... close to Penn Station & the subway. Iâm so glad we stayed there & would definitely stay there again! :);4
very nice hotel for the prices they offer. You will see central park as soon as you get out of the hotel. It is a bit far to downtown Manhattan but not too far to the Empire State Building and to Time Square.;4
I stayed at the Hilton for only one night a couple of days after Christmas.  At first we were planning to visit the park first and then checkin at the hotel and go back to the park later at night.  Then I read that due the expected higher levels of visitors the park would be open at 7:30am for Transformers and 8am for the rest of the rides.  So I decided we take advantage of the early entry (which was available to everyone).  So night before we walked to citywalk which has a lot of great restaurants and shops to eat and browse.  Then next day we got to the park at 7:15am which had a line of less than a hundred people which is miniscle compared to Disney.  The gates open at 7:30am it took about 15 minutes to get down to Transformers.  We were able to ride it twice before 8am and;4
It was a great place to stay heading to Universal Studios with the family. We were in a suite that was really lovely and luxurious- everything was as expected from Hilton's finest. Comfortably slept two adults in a King bed with kids in a pull-out. Enjoyed watching some of the Oscars at hotel bar and staff there were good. Breakfast also not so bad, although didn't try the buffet. My only real complaint about this hotel was that the hot tub was not hot, at all. It was about the same temperature as the pool, and with the weather being a bit cool for this time of the season, a nice warm tub would have been welcomed. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, but you have to be prepared to pay a premium.;4
We loved our stay at Hilton Universal.  We had paid for an upgrade to an executive room which included continental breakfast  which was a good choice. The room was spacious,  clean and quiet. The pool area was great. Location was perfect for walking to and from the park and we even walked down to the metro station to visit Hollywood. The major issue came on check out. The front of desk person was not going to tell us the total  cost of our stay as we had asked for the bill to be emailed. When we finally saw the bill we found that we had been over-charged by $450 on the room rate and $50 restaurant bill that we had not incurred.  The front of desk person was very rude and didn't believe the rate on our booking print out as it was different to that in the system and was dismissive;4
This was an eye opener of a city this is my ideal world to live in what a beautiful city also with its downsides but I always try and find the beauty writhing things! This hotel was another favourite of mine the only problem was the smallish room but what can I say it's New York! But it was still beautiful and the window wasn't that big but we still have a lovely view of the city and the sun setting on the city ! Thy gym was good all facilities were overall great I just wish there was a pool or they light if had one but I didn't know. I would defiantly recommend this hotel and city to tourists as it is a place to see!;4
Second time staying at the Empire, much better room this time, very spacious.  I am not sure why the showers have no door/why the shower heads are placed to allow water on the floor. Still very comfy, great staff;4
Stayed overnight at the Hilton -UnIversal City for a quick visit to Universal Studios. An early check-in and late next day parking checkout really smoothed the logistics for a long distance traveler. The Hotel was cheery, clean, safe & convenient. I would definitely stay here again!;4
"Booked as part of an Expedia flight & hotel package, and as such seemed good value.  Front desk staff very helpful, allowed my mother into the room even though she wasn't on the reservation - she'd arrived a couple of hours before us. Consistently personable and helpful throughout our stay, as were all the staff we encountered.  The decor is jungle inspired and tastefully done, though the public spaces feel a little dark. As you might expect in New York space is at a premium, and the rooms are a little compact - we had a ""superior double"" with nice views up and down Broadway.  Though small by out of town standards the room was nicely finished and very clean. When we needed an iron is was brought promptly, but of course there wasn't much room to store the ironing board when we";4
This was my second stay at The Jane. (Last time, I gave it four stars.) And when it came to writing this review, I looked at others and noticed a pattern: lots of raves...but mostly all only four stars. Why not five?  Why indeed? It's a great location, and the price is fine, and it's clean (as I noted in my earlier review). Can't ask for too much as this price, right? But the fact that it is reasonably priced doesn't mean that ameliorates what is wrong with The Jane. Cheap as it is, you ARE getting a VERY small room (and I knew this from the get-go). So it seems to me that The Jane should--MUST--be held to the same standards as other places.  My complaints about The Jane (which I've sent to management) are these: (1) Noisy noisy noisy doors, slamming day and night. You will hear;4
This is our second stay at the Hilton Universal City and I absolutely love it. The convenient location means you can shuttle to and from Universal city/studios at no charge. The hotel itself is beautiful and views of the studio are amazing. Cafe Sierra downstairs in the lobby provide the most amazing food and service is next to none through out the hotel. We had an issue with our room being quite dusty with airborne dust coming in through the air con and I suffered terribly with allergies due to this and they were kind enough to move us to a new room. I would say that was the only minor issue we had, perhaps a look over at the vents or a deep clean of each room every so often would help. Otherwise we would be happy to return here.;4
We arrived at the hotel, after a transatlantic flight, around 5pm. The bellman met our car and took care of our luggage right away. Check in was almost empty and there was only one guest checking in before of us. As Hilton Honors Diamond members, we were upgraded to an executive room, although this hotel sadly, no longer has an executive lounge. In the absence of the lounge, we were given vouchers for our buffet breakfasts and for canapÃ©s in the lounge. The canapÃ©s vouchers were only valid Monday to Friday, so as we were staying Friday and Saturday, one set was useless. We went up to our room, which was really nice, great views over the Studios and nice and quiet. In out rook was a welcome basket of fruit and snacks That evening we used our canapÃ©s vouchers, which included a;4
If you can manage a small room the hotel has great atmosphere and friendly staff. Lovely afternoon tea and snacks and coffee in the morning. Location is perfect for Times Square and other attractions nearby. Clean and everything worked.;4
It is my first option in New York for location, first of all, and rates.    I love the area and I take use the red line (1,2,3) and get everywhere in minutes from the 72nd stop.    Units come with a furnished kitchen, tv, and private bathroom, so you can shop at Trader Joe's, Faraway or even Zabars' and keep hundreds of dlls in your pocket if you want to cook and relax at home, or even have a great deal at Gray's Papaya Â¨(check the recession special...):  but if you shop and don't look at prices, you could even spend more than ina restaurant when going for cheese, import food, etc.     Close to Central Park and Broadway, what else do you need?     A good room : this is when you have to start a decent fight with the person in charge and try to give a look at as many units as;4
I enjoyed my stay at this location. The bed was extremely comfortable. Upon check in Jerome was so pleasant, he provided excellent customer service. There was another team member who made sure to address my concerns, Ervin, and had a birthday treat sent up for my daughter. Overall, from the moment I entered this location, the team made me feel like a valued guest. Thank you Hilton Universal Team, for making my stay memorable!!;4
"Ate dinner in restaurant twice. Service unbelievably SLOW. Waiter called me ""sweetheart"" and ""love""--I found that disrespectful. Catch of the day was stated as one item, they served a completely different item without consulting me. Basic hamburger & fries: Fries were good, Denny's has better burgers at a fraction of the cost. Cold, microwaved food. This ""restaurant"" has no visible kitchen. I will seek different lodgings next trip.";4
Stayed there for 1 night having finished cruise and flying to Hawaii, the service was excellent we arrived at 9 am and were given a room straight away which was much appreciated, The room was a good size, very clean and the beds were comfortable, good WiFi as well. We ate lunch and dinner in the bar and it was very good but the real standouts were the bar staff they were all great,friendly, knew their stuff and efficient. If you need somewhere to stay near the airport you can't go wrong with the Hyatt, they also run free shuttles to the airport every 15 minutes or so.;4
I took my daughter on a trip of a lifetime.I did my reseach and picked The New Yorker because it was moderately  priced and because we took Amtrak we literally walked one and a half blocks from the train station,so close.Since we walked everywhere the hotel was a no brainer,right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan.The hotel was ran just as a good hotel should be.We walked to Empire State,Macy's,Times Square, Rockefeller Center,and Hudson Yard(Highline/The Edge observation tower just to name a few. I recommend this hotel.;4
This hotel is absolutely fine. It's in a great location near Central Park and near some nice little restaurants and easy access to the subway. It was expensive for wht we got, but thats understandable as it was late december right before new year. Plus hotels and hostels are generally quite expensive in NYC. We were given a free upgrade, which was nice as we werent exepecting a private bathroom. Only downside was a noisy heating pipe in our room, but we just used earplugs to sleep and the pipe helped us dry our washing! I would reccomend.;4
2 nights here is good for me. The service staff is very nice. There is comfortable room with wifi free. Only no restaurant at hotel, so i have to go eat outside, except breakfast. Besides, there is shuttle bus to LAX of 24$. Its very cheap and convenience. I am happy to stay here again.;4
If you're visiting Universal Studios, this hotel is the closest to the park entrance and an easy 7 minute walk from door to door.  The rooms were very nice, amazingly soft beds and pillows, spacious and clean. There's a coffee maker and mini fridge.  We had a great meal in the bar area after getting back kind of late and it was really good.  The wait staff were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  You have to pay for parking (less than parking at Universal), but, you get to leave your car in the lot until 6pm the day you check out for no additional cost.  Sure, the rooms are a bit pricey, but, the proximity and comfort made for a couple of fun, hassle-free, memorable days at Universal!;4
train from Newark airport to Penn Station and a 2 minute walk to the hotel, in the room about an hour after collecting bags. View from the 32nd floor looking along 34th street to ESB, fantastic. Room clean and well tended. Staff at reception very helpful. They are quite proud of the history of the hotel and there is a small section of the downstairs lobby containing photos and posters of famous guests, Nikola Tesla lived the last years of his life there (science geeks like me will appreciate this). If you want somewher central I would strongly recommend the New Yorker.;4
I've booked one night in this hotel as I was in the city for a few business meetings and that was a very good choice ! The hotel is very well located + the room was clean and had a decent size. In addition to that, Mr. Ze from the front desk was very nice and helpful !;4
The staff at the Ameritania were very helpful and more than nice. The bar/restaurant area was small and we didn't take advantage of it much so not a lot to comment on that. There is free infused water in the lobby as well which was a nice touch.   Our room was very spacious (corner unit) and clean. The free Wi-Fi made planning our next day's adventure a bit easier. Three elevators make getting in and out of the building a breeze.  The central location of the hotel is what sold us. Right across from a Subway entrance and next to the Ed Sullivan Theater (Stephen Colbert Show!). Steps from a ton of Broadway Shows.   This was an excellent hotel for the price!;4
My wife and i have just returned from a 7 day stay at the Astor on the Park.  We found it very comfortable, clean and excellent value for money. The staff were helpful and friendly.  At the time of booking we asked for and got a room overlooking Central Park. The room was fine, far from luxury but more than adequate.  Although the hotel is quite a way uptown it is very accesible by subway, the station is just 2 blocks away. But we mainly used the bus M10 that stopped right outside the hotel and takes you to the heart of mid-town Manhattan. A weekly ticket for unlimited use on buses and subway costs just $24. A cab from Times Square to the hotel costs $13.  We actually enjoyed being a bit further away from the tourist areas. It felt more like staying in the real New York.   Some;4
Staff friendly, and checked key on entering, so felt safe. Hotel as described- location perfect- across from Penn Station (3 stops from Newark airport $15.50 single ticket, and Subway to all over city $33 for 7 day ticket- buy in Subway from ticket machine.  Plenty shops around hotel- for tourist merch and drinks/snacks. Also lots places to eat- from Tik Tok Dinner in hotel, to budget breakfasts at Macdonald's across from hotel, and Dunkin Donuts around corner. We also went to Irish sports bar Jack Doyle's just across street and around corner for dinner- very good food / service & inexpensive.  Room was serviced daily- beds made, towels renewed and toiletries replenished. Our room didn't have fridge but had ice bucket and ice machine on next floor.  Room could do with being;4
Just returned from 5 nights in the New Yorker  The hotel is very central and opposite the Empire State . The rooms r very comfy , we were on the 19th floor and my god I would feel so sorry for ones on lower levels, the noise is wild , cars beeping and sirens etc, all day and night long, the windows r not sound proof but I suppose that canât be helped . We also met some of the strangest people we have every met. Overall the staff r very friendly and welcoming and rooms r spotless and comfy and opposite Macyâs shopping mall , McDonaldâs and Starbucks;4
A hotel with character. Room was in good shape, neighborhood was a little sketchy from looks but a safe feeling inside, car was gated for safety, some of the amenities we could not use since they were unavailable after certain times, like the sauna, excercise room etc. People have different lifestyles and this hotel was geared towards people working banking hours. Overall, For an older hotel it was kept up well and an above average breakfast.;4
Tiny single and double rooms decorated as cabins, small and a bit old and worn but comfortable. Situated in a trendy neighborhood and round the corner from the Whitney Museum, and the High Line. Terrace with a great happy hour and beautiful views of the river.  Reasonably priced.;4
Hotel was very clean, inside and out. Valet for parking was very efficient and the attendants were especially friendly. Hotel lobby was spacious and the restaurant made excellent breakfasts. The room was spacious and clean. No complalnts at all, a great experience.;4
We landed from the UK after a 10 hour flight and were taken to this hotel.  We decided to spend the rest of our afternoon chilling out by the pool. Unfortunately it was windy (especially when a plane flew over) a little chilly and noisy due to the planes.  We took the bus down to the beach and got some dinner down there. The bus stop is right outside the front of the hotel. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the beach, however it takes about 30 minutes to get back as the hotel is one of the last drop offs.  The rooms were lovely and spacious. Very modern and clean.  Despite being near the hotel due to the triple glazing you are unable to hear the planes. This made for a comfortable night.;4
Steps from Lincoln Center. Rooms could use renovation. Cheap furniture.  Shower is awkward - with just a glass panel the shower water sprays all over the door and floor.  The bottom of the door is warped from water.  But we will stay there again because it is comfortable enough generally, and, as I said, steps from Lincon Center.;4
I always enjoy coming back to this hotel and have made it my base for staying in LA due the close public transport (MTA Red Line) and leisure things to do.  We stayed from the 26th-31st, 16th floor, and while it may have been winter, there was only one very windy night, even the door staff were watching the planes fly sideways as they flew past.  Great front desk staff and check in, considering my flight normally means I arrive around midday, and I don't like to wait to have a shower after a 15 hour flight over the pacific.  2 Fruit baskets were delivered during our stay, door and general staff always willing to help or just have a chat when they have nothing to do.  Shuttle to Universal Studio's is a plus, however it would be nice if they went down to the MTA stop, rather than;4
Ok so - despite some less than favourable reviews about this hotel recently donât let this put you off - in short for us - there was absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel & I would go back.  The lobby is lovely & we were greeted by a lovely man in reception who checked us in quickly. We had a room on the 34th floor with a partial  view of the city - was it small? Yes it was smaller than what youâd be used to in UK hotels but it was perfectly adequate for 2 adults. There was a walk in wardrobe where we stored our coats & our hanging clothes & we put everything else in the chest of drawers in the room. The bathroom was fine - reallly good shower with plenty of hot water - tv with loads of channels, iron, ironing board, hairdryer, toiletries but no tea or coffee facilities;4
The best part of staying at this hotel is that it is right across from the Metropolitan opera house in Lincoln Centre.  It is an old building but many of its rooms seem to have been modernized.  As I was alone and had paid for a standard single room, I was put in  a lovely, totally modernized and well designed room.  The only problem was that it was really small.  It reminded me of those small tiny rooms offered in some European cities which are nothing more than glorified boxes but cheap!  The Empire, on the other hand, charges N.Y. prices and is therefore not cheap!  I asked to be shown another room and a much larger, but not nearly as nice, was given to me for an additional charge.    Since I was there for almost a full week going to the opera, I really needed the larger;4
"I truly appreciated my experience so much at this hotel that I felt the NEED to write a review.   We arrived for 4th of July weekend, the first holiday after being ""free'd from covid"". We arrived late, which was okay because we were still greeted by welcoming staff. The aesthetics of the room weren't great, but equally not terrible. Truly, it gave us what we needed, a clean and comfortable space to stay. We were there for four nights and quickly became ""part of the family"". Employees began to recognize us and extend an, ""extended stay courtesy"". The best part... we had a dog with us, and normally this would be extremely problematic; however, EVERYONE (including guests even) was amazingly accommodating to us and our pooch. Originally we were going to use a dog sitter, but this";4
I enjoyed staying in a clean, newly appointed room in this centrally located art deco hotel.  Subway very nearby as well as major attractions, decent exercise room,  3 good restaurants attached to the lobby depending on the types of meals you are looking for.;4
A pleasant family room and hotel.  Quite a bit of space for 2 adults and 3 kids.  It is in a good location being on Universal Studios and not far from other touristy areas from Santa Monica to Beverly Hills.;4
"We chose this hotel for it's location across from Lincoln Center. Our ""King"" room was larger than other New York hotels we've stayed in, clean, and the bed was comfortable. Thought we faced the street, on the eighth floor, it was fairly quiet on the weekend. There is a large restaurant where we ate breakfast each day, not inexpensive, but good selection and service.";4
We had a 2 queen bed room - decent room for 4 people, bathroom was large and we had lots of shelving/closet space for storage.  Clean and lots of COVID procedures in place.  We did find that the lack of housekeeping was a little bothersome after 3 days (you can call for garbage pick up or more towels, we found this out a little late).  Parking is onsite but is an extra fee (just FYI).  Super close to Universal - less than 5 min walk which we found handy to go for dinner at City Walk or take a break from the park.   Beds were firm and lots of pillows on the beds (preference, we like lots of pillows).    Overall we thought the hotel was great with a fabulous location (also the restaurant is well rated and very busy....we didn't eat there but the breakfast buffet looked good).;4
The room was small but adequate (European style), clean.  Elevators were fast, never waited, even a minute.  The only negative was that there were no empty plugs for my ipad & iphone, only in the bathroom (thank goodness it didn't fall into the toilet), had to unplug lamp. Friendly staff.  I liked the noon check out as my flight was later.  My initial flight was early, 11A, and they were able to accommodate me with an early checkin (their check in is 3P), amazing. This hotel was rated a 4 star.  I would give it  a 3 1/2.   Great location, close to Penn Station and the Highline and many other attractions.;4
I stayed here June 30-July 2 with my family for a portion of our Southern California vacation. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Universal Studios. It's a quick walk away (or you can take the free shuttle which came by frequently).   We checked in the same day the President of Taiwan checked in. There were crowds, security, camera crews and more everywhere. However we still got checked in with nor worries.  We had a two Queen bed room on the 15th floor. The room was spacious and the beds comfortable.  As others have noted the elevators were a mess, add in the President and her entourage who had their own elevator, and it was a nightmare.   Some areas of the hotel looked new and upgraded and other areas looked pretty old.   We passed by the buffet one night and it;4
Hotel was very nice when you 1st walk in. I Don't think I ever saw a bar tender or the hotel bar ever open. Rooms were nice and cozy. The beds and black out curtains were everything! But the room did not get cold at all. Put the A/C on low for the whole time we were out and it never went under 78 degrees. Thankful the black out curtins helped keep the room coolish or it would have been a miserable day the next day.;4
We are a couple from UK aged 27 and were looking for a great place to stay in NYC. We certainly found it! I booked this apartment as the prices of hotels in New York are just too expensive. I couldn't find anything that looked comparable to these apartments for the money. We prefer to spend our money enjoying the sights and eating great food rather than being too picky about the accommodation. The reviews from a while back worried me a little but I know that some people can be incredibly picky. Remember - these are apartments not a hotel so the service is more laid back...  The apartment was fantastic. We had a separate kitchen with table and chairs, walk in closet with iron, and a cute little bathroom (clean!). The bed was a little bit creaky but it was comfy and clean.  I also;4
"Don't be scared off by the words ""shared bathroom.""  The Jane gives you a clean comfortable room with all the things a traveler needs.  TV, lots of channels, A/C, clothes hooks and drawers and space under the bed for luggage.  Decent sheets, nice towels and a nice bathroom.  The showers and toilets are all individual and private so it's not like you are showering with someone.  You may find yourself brushing your teeth next to some odd character, that would be someone who has lived there for years.  I assume they live behind the doors that are not updated and have old paint jobs, but don't be alarmed, it's New York.  From what I gather the only way anyone can afford to live in the West Village is to be rich or grandfathered in.  The Jane is on a quaint, quiet street paved with";4
"We stayed for 7 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Nice location close to the park and very nice interior. Incredibly trendy and although the rooms are fairly small they are well laid out and comfortable. We visited the bar which did great cocktails. I'd say the only downside was the staff were not quite as friendly and welcoming as i'd expect from a 4* Manhattan hotel. They were a little vague and reserved. It's also worth noting it's location on the west side is not too near many ""touristy"" attractions. This didn't bother us as we quite like being away from the hustle and bustle but it worth noting if you are planning to stay.";4
If you're going to Lincoln Center, you can't do better, location-wise. Unfortunately, our room was very small and far too hot. There was very little space on one side of the bed and the heating unit provided heat, even when set on cool.;4
We spent five nights at the New Yorker. This was our first visit to NY and the hotel made our trip perfect with its great location near, well almost everything! The hotel itself was beautiful and the staff very helpful. Train station and subway are next to the hotel making it easy to move around. Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby and also pharmacies to get some late night snacks to your room.  We had breakfast at one of the property restaurants and oh my what a treat! A good selection of dishes, diner style. The gym was also extensive so you can easily do your your fitness routine there. They also had a business center where you could print out  tickets to shows etc. for free.  So many pros and only one con.. The shower was awful. No pressure and if someone showers or flushes;4
This is a typical Hyatt hotel with extremely convenient airport transfer.  Very nice and inviting lobby.  Good food in the bar.  Nice room but the large window was so dirty it was hard to look through it.;4
I designed to stay 2 days prior our long haul flight, just so the kids will have ample rest before heading home after 2 weeks of non stop tour in the US. I love the free shuttle service and the hospitality. There are not much restaurant nearby so we ended up taking up their buffet bfast which was not much of a spread. The attendants were very very attentive though.I was offered to avail the HYATT REGENCY CLUB access which offered bfast, mid snacks and light dinner. Not too much to choose from but the unli access to drinks, yogurts, nuts served us well. Room is spacious and they have a cafe and a bar on the ground floor to compensate the need.;4
My girlfriend and I plus two friends stayed at the Whydham for 4 nights leading up to New Year's Day. We got a suite with a bedroom with two double beds and a sofa bed in the lounge. It was a great size considering the hotel rooms in NYC. It was perfect for the four of us. The hotel is however an old hotel and the rooms need updating. You can hear people and the plumbing from the rooms next door but it's not too much of a bother because NYC is very loud anyway.  It is in a good position. It is walking distance to Times Square and opposite Maddison square garden. It's also located on 34th street which is a 10 min walk to the start of the high line which is a must for tourists traveling to New York. It takes you down to the meat packers district which is worth seeing.   We didn't;4
I was in need of a one night hotel stay near LAX.  Room: Comfortable and quiet. Shuttle: Convenient and a quick ride. Hotel Bar: Friendly staff and decent bar menu. I would definitely stay again if I need an LAX hotel.;4
The Empire Hotel is in the perfect location to see the best of New York!  They will charge you $3.00 to make a cup of Keurig coffee in your room, but Starbuck's is just downstairs so most folks get dress and go and get their coffee to bring back to their rooms.  I found this tacky on the part of the Empire to charge for coffee -- especially for business travelers.;4
This is a historic hotel (Tesla used to live here), but the age shows in the rooms. Our room was spacious, very quiet (23d floor), efficient and quiet AC, comfortable bed, but otherwise bare bones. Even no coffee maker. The location is convenient to many places. The price seems competitive for Manhattan. I'd like to specifically mention the courtesy and friendliness of all personnel. When we arrived, there was a mistake in reservation, and we had a room with one bed instead of two. I'd like to specifically  thank Miguel EstÃ©vez, who put lot of time and effort to fix the problem in fully booked hotel. The diner downstairs offers good breakfast and other meals throughout the day at very reasonable price.;4
Great location for coming in from Penn Station. Friendly staff and easy check in and out. Room was very cold due to a/c not being able to regulate well. I would stay there again.   I walked to Times Square at night.  It was a lot of fun and an easy distance from the hotel.    The rooms were recently redone on my floor, so the bed and furnishings were nice and very comfortable. The bathroom and shower were updated too and worked very well.;4
over all the staff is very helpfull (except for one front desk staff who is very rude and really has not profile to work in hospitality business). The bar staff is really friendly and kind. Bell men also helps a lot. The room size (king bed) is great for Manhattam average rooms. The bed confort is a plus.;4
14 of us headed to New York on the 3rd of Nov 2015.we ranged from 15 to 60 in age.we arrived at the hotel all excited.check in was fast enough .we all headed to our rooms .on arrivals to rooms were there was 4 adults in each two of the rooms we got were extremely small..there should of been only one double bed in the room as we couldn't move in the room.we went to reception straight away and we change our room .reception dealt with us very politely.our room was a lot bigger with two bathrooms and lots of room which was fantastic.the hotel itself was very central to the Empire State Building,Macy's and time square .its in a great location.very near port of authority aswell.there is an extra charge on the rooms which is a bit expensive as the internet wasn't great and we didn't;4
If visiting New York, please consider the new yorker hotel. Situated in manhattan on 8th Avenue. This hotel is right in the middle of everything. All the major sites are accessible by foot. Pick the right room and your next door neighbour is the empire state building. New York never sleeps but once inside the hotel you get peace and quiet. Decoration is a bit dated but the location far outways that. 24 hr diner in hotel for convenience but many restaurants all around. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Enjoy your trip.;4
Your typical NY hotel. The USP of this place is its location. Closer to Penn station/Macys and other touristy stops.  The rooms are typical NY, small but functional. The bathroom was well appointed. The gym is particularly great. As a place to spend few nights in NY , this is as good as any out there.;4
We stayed as a family of 4 in the Hilton Universal City for 3 nights in August. The hotel was easy to get to without having to drive through down-town LA. The  receptionist who checked us in was fantastic and very knowledgeable and welcoming. It was my sons birthday whilst we were there so she gave him a voucher to choose an in-room movie which was nice. We had paid to stay on the Executive level and we were on the 21st floor. It was great because the room itself was really quiet, but the room itself was a little disappointing. Perfectly fine and clean, but I had paid an extra Â£300 to stay in what I thought would be a better and bigger room, but to me it just seemed like a standard room. Not sure what we paid the extra money for? I would stay at this hotel again without;4
I have stayed at this hotel several times.  The rooms can be a little dark but they are clean and big especially by New York standards.  Above all, I want to praise Pasquale at the front desk.  He always has a smile on his face and is very eager to help in any way. We have always enjoyed our stays at the Empire and will continue to use the hotel.;4
Great location, food, comfy beds and an excellent staff! Walking distance to Universal Studios and The City Walk! Quiet to sleep and good food in the hotel restaurant! Had a wonderful time without having to drive anywhere!;4
Good hotel and location is amazing ,security is good  at hotel, you have best location of newyork nearby so you  can walk the talk,lobby area is good, staff is good and so you would have a good overall experience in my view;4
We got this hotel through Hotwire and paid $83 per night. We arrived at 7am to the hotel where they gave us both our rooms right away. They also allowed us a late check out for one of our rooms. I would say this is a typical NYC hotel, older and small but it is in a great location! You are a block from a bigger subway station on the red line which takes you right into lower Manhattan. There is a great Corner deli that has more food options then you can imagine. We ate there every morning and the prices were great. I would stay here every time we go to NYC!! Can't wait to go back!;4
Very nice hotel and our corner room offered a great view of the city. Very large and comfortable room and bath. Evening buffets very absolutely fabulous. Ezra, bartender, was quite nice and knew how to mix superb Martinis. And my Horned Frogs won the Rose Bowl!;4
Wonderful hotel in a very central location. A couple of blocks from Time Square and The Empire State Building is all within walking distance. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were quaint. Enjoyed my stay here!;4
We had great service from Megan at the desk, a bellhop Dewayne I think was his name, and Paula in the restaurant. Breakfast inclusion would have made it great but the lack of it will be the reason I will not choose it in the future.;4
Our stay was one night only, but staff was very accommodating with our early arrival and made us feel comfortable.  The room was small but well appointed, and we had everything we needed, although a bathtub would've been wonderful.;4
A hotel build in 1929, entirely kept in the '30 ies athmosphere but up to date in service an technology. Nicolai Tesla used to reside here until the end of his life and found a little museumspot in the ba&sement of the lobby. The hotel has an impressing hall and elevator for levels 1 - 20 and 20 - 40. At our last stay (we stayed here already once - 8yrs ago) we had a room on the 40th floor with a perfect view on the NY skyline and Empire State building. We love the atmosphere and the friendly staff. renewal of rooms is in progress, but did not reach the 40th floor yet. Nevertheless the room was always clean and comfortable. The hotel doesn't offer a breakfast service, but just next door there is a great diner you just can walk into from the lobby.;4
Got this hotel at a really good price and have to say in the most positive feedback. Positive  Good location everything in walking distance and right by subway for longer journeys. Rooms whilst small are clean and I have stayed in smaller ones in New York such as the Edison.  House keeping stood out as friendly and doing a great job.  Negative  The hotel tax. Told it paid for use of gym, business suite and faster WiFi. None of which I needed I was on holiday. I did go into the business suite to print off boarding passes. It was basically two computers with printers. There was no toner and limited paper. It felt a little like money grabbing, for example it was $3 per bag to store them in the day of departure including a small handbag.  In conclusion positive stay with small;4
This is a perfectly decent hotel in a great area.  We were attending the Philharmonic across the street and this made for a perfect ladies parlor beforehand.  Could use a little update on electronics as well as bedding.  None the less, all parties were satisfied with this hotel.;4
The room was had musty smell so had to keep air con on all the time but it was clean and the best thing was about $500 cheaper that in midtown manhattan ( for 4 nights) and subway across street so was downtown in 10 minutes;4
Stayed here in Jan 2017 for our family visit to Universal Studios. Whilst the most affordable rooms are the usual standard 2 bed set-up, you cannot get any closer to the action.   The staff are great. We didn't have the expensive buffet, preferring to go to one of the many places at Universal Walk where it is much cheaper.  Still can't believe that in this day and age and given the cost of the rooms (it's not cheap), a Hilton Hotel doesn't offer complimentary Wi-Fi in the rooms (only in the foyer area). Do Management realise that people will actually chose another hotel based on this alone??  It's the way of the world people, get with it!;4
"Good hotel for the price in a great upper West Side location. There are many restaurants and stores in the vicinity.  It is a short three block walk to Central Park.  It is an older hotel; not fancy, but perfectly functional.  It also was surprisingly quiet.  Very close to subway.";4
Hotel was clean and housekeeping did a good job in the rooms. Found reception staff a bit hit & miss. Check in was not very friendly & did not explain hotel facilities. After a 16 hour flight a smile would have been nice. On other days reception staff were welcoming and provided tips on places to eat locally.  Pool is outdoors and slightly away from the actual hotel. Access through car park. Breakfast was average. Layout was odd. You were criss crossing the area and other guests to get things. Ie: plates for toast on left side of room toasters on right. Toasters were only 4 slices not the normal industrial belt drive so we all had to wait for each otherâs toast to pop.  Hotel has a deal with a taxi/hirer car company. $65.00 US flat rate to LAX Air Port. Good rate but the taxi;4
this hotel was stunningly beautiful as we walked into the lobby after a 7 hour flight. We had a 2 bed 2 room suite to sleep 6. The room was perfectly good and the view was great with one bed having a view of the empire state and the other a view of the chrysler. The room was clean but quite tired and could do with a bit of a kick up the bum to bring it to modern day. We ate at the diner attached to the hotel for two of the breakfasts, the first was excellent and the second was good but the orders came out wrong. The diner is quite pricy and a voucher with the room might be a nice touch. The hotel was really near Penn Station but it was not noisy, maybe that was just because we were on the 34th floor.;4
A great location for exploring Manhattan. The room is small and we just about managed with 4 people in the room which has 2 small double beds. The room did need a bit of attention with a few small items needing fixing, but overall not a big complaint. Nice touch are the welcome drinks in the lobby.;4
"Service was understated, but good when needed. (f.E. late checkout 82 p.m.) was no problem. Leda Popoviq from the front desk was very friendly and helpful (printing out a voucher). We had the only a problem to leave the hotel :-), because the lock of the ""keycard"" room door was out of order. But help and assitance to solve problem was perfect and fast. So we had no problem to get our shuttle (Thanks for it)";4
Nice hotel, good location easy for subway and easy to walk to time square, directly opposite Central Park. Don't be fooled by photo of pool on the website it is really just a plunge pool and rather cold, but the pool deck is lovely;4
Right on the doorstep of Universal City and the entrance to universal studios.  Superbly clean and comfortable room also. We were on loor 14 looking out onto the hills and there was very little noise from the highway.  The pool is nice ans the hot tub too. You would forget you were in such a built up area.  We didnt eat there but theres a coffee counter with starbucks if you want something quick which was nice.  The shuttle bus was never running in the evenings we were there however. its advertised as if its there all the time.   However a shuttle bus to the hop on/off tours of hollywood stop at reception every hour which is great.  1 thing to note is that the walk from the hotel to the Universal cuty area is NOT wheelchair friendly.  parking is around 15 dollars a night.;4
The location of the hotel was excellent, as was the cleanliness of our room. The Tick Tock Diner on site made breakfast easy and it had a vast menu, regardless of which meal you were eating. The only comment I would make is that there were no tea & coffee making facilites in the room which would have made the stay a little nicer. But, having said that, we would return and would recommend it to others.;4
This is a nice hotel in a great location. Within a few blocks of a subway entrance and within walking miles of good restaurants. My only complaint is that my shower was missing its door so it caused water to get all over the floor. Also, the TV was not mounted on the wall (though there was a wall mount) and was instead on the desk, which meant there was no desk in the room to work. Other than that, overall, it was a good room.;4
"Great place to stay friendly .best bed ave ever slept in .tick tock dinner fab.can""wait to go back .rockafeller building was fantastic.great views.hop on hop buses not bad .but can be long .done a boat trip around ellis island' and statue of liberty .amazing veiw of brooklyn and new Jersey.";4
I have stayed at the Empire Hotel many times. Its very reasonably priced and a good value for NYC. Great location, friendly helpful staff.  I like the surrounding neighborhood in general and for accessing Central park.;4
We stayed here on a family holiday in August 2013. Very handy for all the touristy bits and a great bar/breakfast. We stayed on the executive floor and the rooms were a bit dated and could do with updating. Great views of the Hollywood freeway and staff all super friendly! Lifts can get a bit packed in the mornings but overall a good hotel.;4
Location is everything, so if you want to be near Lincoln center and Columbus Circle, this is the spot.  I've also stayed in the nearby Hudson hotel, and for me the Empire wins.  Small room, great bed, odd shower stall (no door, but somehow it works).  Literally steps from 3 restaurants and a Starbucks.  Eerily dark lobby for some reason, and the elevators are very slow at peak times.  $43 cab ride from La Guardia.  I wish I had asked for a room with a view when I checked in.  Room 402 faces another building 10 feet away.;4
This is my second time that I have stayed in the New Yorker. Itâs pretty basic, itâs clean, the rooms are small, the pricing is reasonable and the location is great. Not much else that I have to say other than the fact that I would use this hotel again if I visit again.;4
Stayed for 3 nights at the Hilton in order to explore LA and universal studios. The room was great for our family of 4, we had a high floor overlooking to pool and it was very quiet. Room was clean and had a fridge, safe, coffee machine. We used uber whilst staying here which I would recommend rather than parking a car as parking is very expensive. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Pool towels are provided, again very useful when travelling around. The walk to universal studios & city walk from the hotel is 5 mins on a very safe path/bridge or there is a shuttle if needed.;4
We were made welcome from the time we arrived. Great breakfast and hotel facilities. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout. Room standard hotel room but clean and tidy. Lift is the slowest in California. Plenty of parking available;4
Amazing location. Premier Plus room worth the extra cash. Very clean. Reasonably quiet. Friendly housekeeping staff. But sadly check-in was chaotic. Self serve machines were not working properly. Staff had to break off half way through check-in to do other things. Two separate queuesfor the manned check-in meant that 3 parties arriving after me were checked in first simply because the person serving them was quicker. Needs more organization / signage.;4
Very comfortable room for a short period. Not fancy, room service is good. No breakfast is offered at tbe hotel. The area is near to chinese restaurants and the subway station. Not a very bad location.;4
We only stayed one night, but the area was so nice we wanted to stay another! Unfortunately they were booked full so we had to move to the Sheraton next door which wasn't as nice. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone doing Universal Studios! They offer complimentary shuttle to CityWalk which is a bunch of shops and restaurants and that was a fun place to visit not too far from hotel.;4
Because I was traveling solo I didn't mind, but this room was teeny weeny. Very quiet and well-appointed, one of the best night's sleep I've had in New York City. Super friendly and helpful staff, and great Upper West Side location, just opposite Lincoln Center. A change for me, but I enjoyed spending time near Columbus Circle.;4
This hotel was a great location, near Lincoln Center, subways and easy taxi service.Room was small but clean.Rooftop bar was very nice. It was a popular place after the performance at the Lincoln Center.  Bartender in the lobby bar was very friendly and helpful.Doorman was helpful. We didn't use the dining facilities.;4
We stayed there on two separate occasions in August. First time we were given a room upgrade, which was a nice size the second time we stayed we got a standard room which was a little small. The rooms had coffee machines and the usual accessories. Staff were polite and generally helpful.  The hotel has an art deco theme in the rooms. We were told that rooms had recently been refurbished, not sure I would have guessed without being told.AC was load but very good.  The hotel is well located. Madison Square Gardens is across the road, Time Square is not too far a walk and there is a Subway station right next to the hotel which goes straight to JFK.  There are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants locally and a Hertz car rental round the corner (though I have never been to a less;4
Very spacious hotel room and friendly staff. Close to airport but very quiet so easy to sleep. Good food in bar area and 24-hour cafe available. There is a Shuttle bus between airport and hotel every 15 minutes.;4
We booked this hotel due to its location and we would definitely stay there again. After a long flight to JFK, simply take the air train to Jamaica then change to the Long Island Rail Road to Penn Station. Penn is directly opposite the hotel. There is also a subway stop just outside the hotel entrance and this served our purposes for sightseeing.  Check in was straightforward and they put a pending charge on our credit card for $100. They told us this would not be taken if we didnât use the facilities. We didnât and sure enough, the money was not taken. WiFi was free for us due to the company we booked with but we were told it was chargeable ordinarily.  The room itself was quite small but this was to be expected in midtown. It was also a little dated but it did the job. There;4
This hotel is a great location for visiting Lincoln Center or for college visits. Rooms are not big but you will find that a lot in NYC. Seemed clean enough. It can get noisy do tru to get away from elevator. Nice lobby with lobby bar. Also great rooftop bar with amazing views There is also a pool but I didnât check it out.;4
Location was great, walking distance but shuttle buses offered anyway. It was very expensive but part of the choice you make for convenience. The view of Universal Studios was great, and the pool area was VERY nice. The rooms were comfortable and clean, except the coffee maker was filthy. Staff were very nice, but i waited in line for the front desk for at least 15 minutes for check in and check out, way too long.;4
good:  optimal location clean room daily cleaning of kitchen, shower and toilet lovely cat in the neighborhood tesco, iceland, boots, poundland nearby  bad:  no kitchen utensils doors have no damper ---> loud bang in the night :-(;4
I was there to attend the ballet and a family party.This hotel was in a perfect location for Lincoln Center and the surrounding area, Central park, museums etc. The art deco motif is beautiful. The staff was helpful and friendly.;4
Cinthya. R at the from desk was very friendly and helpful she made our stay very enjoyable, Cinthya you are great and Gisel C was very helpful, we were very happy with the ladies that clean  my room every day, very trustworthy people ( Aurora L, Carmen Miranda and Wendy G)  The Complimentary breakfast was excellent.   I ask for an upgrade for my room staff said no, did not try to accommodate my request even though  I spend 7 days and during the week after rooms was available.   This hotel is in the heart of everything, you can easily take the bus to the Walk of Fame, the Dolby Theatre  and you can get to the Santa Monica Pier with just one bus. You really donât need a tour Guide to charge you $158.00 from the tour that the hotel recommended.  I did have concern about the area.;4
I believe the closest hotel to LAX for an airport hotel this one is very comfortable, clean, friendly and modern. Excellent pool area, though, the water is very hot. Room was a decent size, watching the planes come and go was fun. Our only major complaint was restaurant choices. The only restaurant is Kieran and almost every dish is spicy. If that is not what you want you are out of luck. There are hotels down the road with better options. I would still stay here, in fact, we will be back in two weeks. I would just eat somewhere else now that I know how close the others are.;4
Nice hotel, very well located in the city close  many attractions and several public transports, highly recommend for a stay in Manhattan. Rooms are comfy and clean, the staff is really nice. The fitness room is OK. The pool is really small, more for children. The breakfast is over priced, but there is a starbuck just downstairs.;4
Celebrating our anniversary turned out to be a scorching heat wave in NYC but Andrea in the Lobby Bar was a pleasure from the first day. Relatable and easy to make you feel welcome.  Friendly, professional and makes a great drink too!;4
"I was charmed by this hotel. The remaining art deco features are a delight. The adjacent ""Diner"" was superb with lovely food and charming and helpful waiters. It's location is superb (just down the road from Macy's) and close to Maddison Square. Okay, so some of the rooms are a bit dated - but that's the charm? Security and staff excellent.";4
I was in NYC for the week of Easter break with my nephew and we stayed at The Jane. What a great place! The staff was so friendly and accomodating and very helpful with any concerns or questions. We stayed in the bunk bed cabin which was really tiny but manageable, it might have helped if our suitcases had not been so big :)  The rooms and shared bathrooms were VERY clean and comfortable other than being small. The Cafe Gitane was a fun place to eat with really good food and menu selection. The price was right and the location was perfect other than the fact it is a good 10-15 minute walk to the nearest subway station. They have bikes to ride, free of charge and we took a great ride down to the battery on the Hudson River Parkway bike path, about a 10-15 minute ride by bike. If;4
Nice lobby area, will keep luggage in a store room if you are early $10.per bag. Convienient to Empire State and Times Square. Very tiny bathroom ( we're talking cruise ship tiny). Friendly staff. Good bar with happy hour.;4
Stayed here after arriving from the East Coast around midnight.  The shuttle arrived after a 15 minute wait and it was only about 5 minutes to the hotel.  Very modern and clean lobby and room with plenty of space for my family.  Very nice pool which we used in the morning.;4
Good service and friendly people.  Would go back for another stay. Close to a lot of attractions and nightlife.  Good price for the rooms.  Would recommend to friends and book another trip for the future.;4
"This is my second time staying at The Empire. For some reason, I like it. It has a great vibe, it is a ""darker"" hotel that almost feels somewhat steampunkish. The overall look and feel of it is what mostly attracts me.  The rooftop cocktail lounge is nice, but it gets very busy as does the lobby bar. The lobby can get incredibly loud with large groups of younger people having drinks.  Rooms are very small and this is where the biggest shortcoming of the hotel is. Space in NY comes at a premium, so it is somewhat expected, but they are tiny. I was alone and had a suit case and a carry one. That is enough to make it feel crowded. You can't sit on the toilet without closing the door, that kind of cramped.  There is no room service so you either have to eat at the cocktail lounge,";4
I stayed for three nights with my teenage son and found it a really good base. It is very close to the tube station and local shops. The rooms were basic but clean and our twin room had a fridge in it which was really useful. There were also plates bowls mugs and cutlery in the room. The room was clean. The showers were warm and clean. As has been mentioned on here the staff weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude either. I thought the hostel was excellent value for money.;4
Our first visit to New York but since I had spent time to learn about the city I chose this hotel for price and location. My wife and I were not disappointed with the room (37th floor with a view looking south). Worth the extra I think. Room was ok but a bit cramped...this being NY there was no kettle in the room. But the diner on the ground floor was very good value and was open 24 hours. I got coffees every morning from Starbucks over the road to take back to the room first.  The location is VERY handy for tourists being close to two subway lines serving 34th Street. Penn station on the opposite corner. Buying a multi day or multi journey subway ticket is cheap and simple. Location was excellent for walking to attractions and shops...On 34 St you get Macy's and the Empire;4
Honestly, I almost cancelled my trip to NYC when I read the reviews about the hotel.  That would have been a big mistake since me and 4 of my friends spent a very nice - not to mentioned relatively cheap (!) - 3-day weekend in NYC in early March 2011, thanks to Riverside Studios Hotel.  The room is very faded, the paint is old, the carpet is teared up in the corner and the place is a bit noisy, BUT the room is large, clean, includes a fridg and a TV.  You share the bathroom, but water pressure is very good and hot water is not a problem.    Seriously, I think it's hard to ask for more at that price...  It cost us 20 $ each per nights (5 adults), all included!  All this at a very walkable distance from Times Square and only a few blocks away from a subway station.  I surely;4
I am always pleased with my stay at the Empire Hotel.  The rooms, lobby and lounge are beautifully decorated, impeccably cleaned, and very cozy.  The vibe is contemporary art-deco, very hip.    I was warmly greated and checked in by Nick.  The hotel clearly prides itself on its attention to customer service.  The staff is always courteous, prompt and cordial.  I look forward to my next visit.;4
This will have been the second time I've stayed here within six months, having stayed here previously with my wife.  Rooms are huge, beds are comfortable and overall not bad for what you pay.  Breakfast is basic, but very good and the hotel in general has been given a makeover.  Car parking on site for a fee.  Location is remote in regards to walking distance to main areas, however the metro is 5 mins walk away.  If you've got a car, or you don't mind a little walking, this hotel is in the perfect location.  I will be back!;4
Location rules is a lesson we have learned through our travels! And the Empire Hotelâs location can not be beaten in NYC. But for the great location you have to sacrifice and here you will sacrifice amenities. The Empire is virtually a few steps away from the Lincoln Center, a few more from Grand Central Park and Julliard, and a chipping wedge from Columbus Circle. Taxis and Ubers are constantly in front of the hotel entrance. All the subway lines pass through Columbus Circle and the bus stops are right there. When hungry there is PJClarkeâs, Rosaâs, and The Smiths within a few minutes or less walk.  The hotel is extremely clean and the cleaning staff receives kudos. The front desk is very helpful but the door guys will go the extra mile for you. Now the amenities, like wi-fi,;4
Great for tourists or visiting friends. Basic hostel accommodation and for Â£18 a night you can't complain. Recently refurbished so still fairly well kept. 24hr reception is very helpful. Hammersmith is an ok area and it only takes 30 minutes into central London.;4
After reading previous reviews, we were a little worried about the state of this hotel.  We were very surprised at how nice it actually was.  The room was clean and modern. No bedbugs like other reviews had mentioned.   A little small but had a mini fridge and microwave.  We were lucky enough to have a room that had a balcony facing the courtyard so we did not hear any of the street noise.  The hotel is pet friendly and I have severe allergies.  The staff was more then accommodating to a room on the 3rd floor that was not pet friendly.   The breakfast served every morning was great considering it was included.  I couldn't complain about fresh made waffles, eggs, sausage and toast.  It was a great start to our mornings.  We had brought our laptop with us because the rooms have;4
I stayed at this hotel during my first stay in New York. My expectations were very high - and I most say, I didn't get disappointed. Eventhough I read alot of reviews saying that the hotel was dirty and the staff rude.  I liked my room very much. It was beeing cleaned everyday. The staff was sweet and helpful - also when I got a package delivered at the hotels front desk.  I want to stay there again when I come back.;4
Better than I expected.  Had a great comedy show downstairs in the bar at night.  Rooms were good.  Great location.  Night manager was a bit of a rip off merchant - so I would organize stuff (ie. transfers etc.) with day staff. got a cheap deal through getaroom.com;4
Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we had a brilliant time. As my title suggests the location of this hotel is brilliant, 5 mins walk from central park or 10 from broadway. Hotel bar is very nice and the pool on top is an extra bonus to cool down after a long day walking around in the heat. The roof top bar is also a good place to start your evening and seems to be a favourite amongst the locals as there were often queues to get in (guests can just walk in) and it produces a quite stunning view of the city in the evening. The room was small but very nice and clean. You could do a lot worse than enjoy a long weekend here;4
Hotel was a perfect location for my needs. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was nice except for a couple of odd issues. (No convenient place to plug in charger. Bathroom door was cracked and chipped though bathroom had been nicely renovated). I would stay there again.;4
My daughter and I stayed here for several days and enjoyed the hotel. The staff was friendly. The room was clean. The the price was reasonable. If you want to be near the airport area and want a clean, safe hotel, I would recommend the Hyatt.;4
We stayed at this hotel between Xmas and new year and had an amazing time. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist and told we had been given free wifi which was perfect for planning our daily activities.  After what is read in previous reviews and being quite a fussy person I was your worried about the room. I didn't need to be, the room was spotless, more spacious than I expected and a lovely view. The bathroom was a bit on the small side and did get very wet as the shower door seemed to have been removed.   We found some lovely restaurants just around the corner from the hotel which were fabulous after a day exploring in the city. I would recommend pj Clarkes on the corner and rosa mexicano which was a beautiful Mexican meal.   The personal concierge was also very helpful;4
My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and was great.  Room was on the 5th floor.    Room and separate living room and bedroom.  Room was larger that what I expected.  Very clean room.  2 TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom.  Bathroom connected with the bedroom.  Furniture were in decent condition.  Carpet and flooring very clean.  View wasn't that great...but that was ok.  Friendly front desk.  Housekeeping excellent.  I would come back and stay.  Great diner next to the hotel...a must see...;4
we arrived at the hotel an hour early and were asked we had to wait so we ate the hotels restaurant ordered a club sandwich and calamari it was nice... went back to front desk and the room is still not ready i was pissed off having jetlagged and travelled 14.5 hours all the way from new zealand...but in return we got free breakfast, nice room and i like how the manager handled everything... very close to universal studios.. we will be back!;4
"The location is really great - the hotel seems old but it doesn't feel like it. It's huge, and to get to the room is like walking through a maze, but the room itself was just fine, clean, comfy. No coffee in the room though. They charge a fixed $25 ""service"" fee which is annoying (why charge extra through the backdoor instead of part of the room's cost?). At the lobby they have a small coffee stand which saves the need to go out in the cold in the morning for a coffee.";4
Pascuale was wonderful! We had to wait until 3:30 PM for our room and he rewarded us with a nice suite. He also patiently helped us with the nuanced wifi for each area of the hotel. The Empire is a great location --  just blocks from the park where you can experience the best of nature along side the thrills of New York City.  Our unrushed breakfast on the mezzanine was good, too.;4
The room we received was a good size for New York, clean and well kept. We had a view of the city which was great. It's located on 8th and 34th across from Madison Square Garden, 10 minute walk to Times Square and 10 minutes to Bryant Park. It's central to Manhattan, easy to travel from on the subway. We walked everywhere though and found it perfectly located. The Tick Tock Diner is a real find too, great food at a reasonable price.;4
the rooms are small, the location is great and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The morning coffee was also a nice touch.  A shot walk to Time Square and tons of bars and restaurants in the area;4
I have stayed at this hotel numerous times in the past. In fact my son spent his honeymoon night here. The hotel used to be a Ramada Inn.  The location in Vermont is convenient for the area. The parking out back is secure.   The cost is reasonable for the area.  Breakfast is provided between 6:30am and 10:30 am. On the week-end expect a long line for the omelets if you wait to 8:30. The breakfast includes juices, coffee and cereals. Leave room for sausages and potatoes. Handle is right and you could skip lunch.  The rooms have been nicely upgraded. Wood floors and nice decor. Like most hotels outlets for your electronics is limited.  The hallways are nicely improved with sconce lighting and plush carpets. The ceilings have a nice Art Deco feels.  Overall this hotel I think is;4
The service at Astor was truly terrific! They helped us locate the subways and provided maps with very good directions. When i ran to the next door convenience store and came back with a cake they asked what i was doing and i said that i had bought a birthday cake for my fiance. They gave me some candles and all came to my door to sing my partner 'a happy birthday'! They were just so friendly! The location is literally facing Central Park! The rooms are small, but extremely clean with a good sized bed and bathroom. It's only a few blocks to the subway which takes about a 5 minute walk and takes you all the way down the west side of manhattan.They also had an airport shuttle. I would definitely visit this hotel again!;4
The price of this hotel located on the Upper West Side is really reasonable. And the location is really great. Within walking distance to Central Park and American Museum of Natural History. The hotel itself is pretty old, but no qualms there as the rooms were clean enough and managed to get a good nights sleep. Staff were friendly and helpful.;4
I booked this hotel with my son for two nights, itâs good for travelers who had flights and need to take a rest before the flight, we had clean, wide room and big bed to sleep, the location is near to the airport, you need a car or a ride for moving in LA;4
"We stayed here for five days while we were visiting Hollywood.  We didn't want to stay at an expensive place where there was a lot of traffic to fight but wanted a nice clean hotel.  Don't let the outside of this hotel fool you as you pull off the street to the front check-in.  For some reason the picture above of the pretty ""front"" is in the back of the hotel where the parking lot and pool are.  We made the mistake of looking for what was in that picture instead of paying attention to the numbers so we drove right by the hotel a couple of times without knowing it. Our stay had a great buffet breakfast included with the price.  The eggs were cooked to order right in front of you along with fresh waffles.  I felt safe here in this area and walked a lot during the daylight hours.";4
Great luxurious hotel in a great location, friendly and helpful reception staff who made our visit go with ease! Rooms are nice and modern and feel luxurious. Had a bad view in the room and not a lot of natural light in the room. But besides that the room was clean and spacious. Loved the decor!   Amenities are extortionate, $8 dollars for bottled water and a ridiculously overpriced mini-bar. Also never stayed in a hotel which charges for tea and coffee in the room. As tea drinking Brits this was heartbreaking ! ð ...Was cheaper to go to Starbucks next door but we Ended up buying tea bags and milk from a local supermarket.  They also charged for wifi in the room at $10 a day. Whilst there was free wifi in the lobby, it was kind of inconvenient, Was cheaper to buy a US Lyca SIM;4
Great room..good air con....good services overall.....bathroom configuration odd but serviceable. Discrepancy over booking.com bill not easily resolved...but satisfactory overall....restaurant not used......rooftop pool very small...needed attention...water appeared very cloudy.....therefore did not use...;4
"Made the dramatic decision to visit New York for the holidays and was offered this hotel as one of a selection by the agent. Very pleased we chose it as it sits in a great location for the New Year celebrations and we were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to see. The room was comfortable and quiet, even when the party was in full swing on New Years Eve, and housekeeping was perfectly acceptable. The mini bar and snacks are well overpriced so we picked up a few things from the drug store around the corner to snack on. Staff were always courteous and helpful, even at 3am. Some American friends managed to get a last minute room and join us for the event but their room was rather cramped; guess you get what you pay for. I would happily stay there again and I notice there";4
The receptionist spoke Portuguese, to our surprise, and was extremely friendly and helpful at our arrival. Unfortunately, the lift was not working, which made us go up to the 4th floor with our bags (they offered to help). They could not get it fixed throughout our 5 day stay. When we booked in, there were only the bunk cabins left. It was way smaller than we expected (it is REALLY SMALL), but it incredibly fit EVERYTHING we needed. Unbelievably clever interior design allowed for 2 TVs, lots of hooks for clothes and towels (they provide excellent white towels and robes as well), 2 big drawers, 2 bottles of drinking water (which they also provide daily, for free, in very charming customized glass bottles - which are not free). The pillows were marvellous, and there was central;4
Great location, tiny rooms as expected in NYC. We were on the 20th floor and were upgraded for my boyfriends birthday to a view of the Empire State from our room. Very noisy from noise outside and rooms are so close could her next doors conversation. Lovely surprise for his birthday from the hotel bottle of Prosecco and chocolates and a card. We arrived at 6.30 in morning and couldnât check in until 4 but paid 50 dollars to check in and they found us our upgraded room straight away. Only thing which really annoyed me hence 1 star less is we checked out at 12 our flight not until 7.30 in the evening and they charge you for storing your luggage 5 dollars per item some may think nothing of that. But when youâve just stayed with them for 6 nights I think thatâs a joke!;4
We enjoyed 2 nights at this property this past July while visiting Universal Studios. Loved the room and we got a great view of city from the 19th floor. Pros: food, location, trustworthy housekeeper. I left my make-up bag hanging on the back of the bathroom door with $500 in high end products and thankfully it was turned in to security. It was shipped back with no damage of contents and I am very grateful it was turned in.  I know it was my oversight for leaving my stuff in the room, but it would be greatly appreciated if shipping charges would be waived for their Diamond guests. Legoland shipped us our child's flip flops that were left at their water park free of charge and we have no type of membership with them, but we always speak highly of Legoland because of their great;4
"First the pros; the hotel has a lot of historical charm, and nice art deco style.  Our room, while small, had only one queen bed, so it still seemed plenty large.  We had a view of the Hudson from our 29th floor room.  The bed was comfortable, with crisp, cool sheets.  The lobby was nice and it was handy to have three restaurants right on site.  We had a 5 hour delay on our flight, so it was great to have the Tick Tock Diner right there, open 24/7, so we could still get something to eat at 10:30 p.m.  Staff was pleasant. Even though the street outside was busy, we had little to no noise to disturb our sleep.  The con; really, only one--the bathroom is a typical footprint for what would have been standard in 1929, in that it was SMALL.  No room to put your toiletries, and one of";4
This was where we stayed for our 2018 Girls trip to NYC.  Location is close to Macyâs, Empire State Building, Starbucks, restaurants and the Subway.  It was a short walking distance to Time Square, Broadway plays, Radio City Music Hall & train station.  As for the hotel the sink in my room wouldnât drain.  The shower was such hat you needed to get in to start the water.  Comfortable bed and quiet dark room.  Iâd stay here again, but there were âhiddenâ fees of almost $30.  My $159 a night resulted in a $209 stay.  They put a $45 hold on my card, but I expected that.;4
Stayed here 4 nights but booked only really for sleeping in. Our room was pretty small & basic but had everything we needed. No tea/coffee facilities in room but you can get for an additional fee. Lobby very grand & good security as they ask to see your key before you get to the lifts so felt safe. Great view of the Empire State Building from our room. Room cleaned every day & fresh towels left. Great location as only 10/15 minute walk to Empire State Building/Times Square & right next to Penn Subway line. Couple of restaurants attached & plenty cafes/fast food places close by. Madison Square Gardens just across the road. Friendly staff & would stay again.;4
After after a long day of travel from The Bahamas, I expected the check-in process to be stressful but had the luxury of having a completely different experience. Mohammad was absolutely awesome, he made sure I felt at home and that things were smooth with my process. He even called up to the room to make sure I was happy. I wanted to write a review early because I know I may forget but I wanted to highlight his great hospitality. Will stay again in a heartbeat and will recommend to my colleagues.;4
The first room was in the 2.second floor, this was changed with immediately . Friendly staff. Rooms were small, but clean. Location to Lincoln Center and restaurants are super. Free WI FI was nice -Room were expensive . NY standard?;4
My daughter and I enjoyed our stay at The Jane! Shared bathrooms and showers were no problem for us. The size of our room was a novelty instead of an inconvenience. The staff could not have been nicer or more hospitable. We arrived in the city on a Wed morning and were able to check in upon arrival. Our bags were stored  for us the morning we checked out as we had a few hours to explore before our flight home. The front desk staff even called ahead for our transportation to the airport. The dÃ©cor and atmosphere was beautiful. We knew ahead of time the ballroom is now a night club. We could hear the music in our 4th floor room. Reading previous reviews, I knew to expect it. I just turned the tv up! We will most definitely stay with Jane again!;4
Had a free night from Wyndham rewards that was going to expire so we decided to spend a night in NYC.  The room was small but newly refurbished and clean.  We were on the 8th floor, there was a view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden from out window.  There was a kuerig coffee maker in the room.  The bathroom had a fully glass enclosed shower and was very pretty. The downside was the traffic noise.  Our room was facing 8th avenue off W.34th street.  Horns honking and police car sirens went on all night.  I would return.;4
Nice large room with a fridge and a microwave. The fridge was a bit loud at night. Bathroom was okay. Shower hot. Very very good breakfast buffet. Hotel is near metro. Nice courtyard. Would come again.;4
In transit and needing a hotel to layover this one is really near to the airport making the transfer really quick. The shuttle buses are quick, clean with friendly drivers. The hotel must have been recently refurbished and is modern inside. There is a shop / cafe which is reasonably priced for a hotel. The pool area is great, with complimentary towels. Our room was a suite, with a huge bathroom and walk in shower. The 2 rooms were not completely 2 rooms as the wall between the 2 was only a partial wall but it was fine. There was a coffee machine and decent size fridge with complimentary water. Good choice for a lay over.;4
We booked this hotel as we knew we were only going to be in LA for a short time and it was close to the airport.  We arrived later in the evening, so most of the food service in the airport was either closed or the lines were really long.  We decided to grab some food from the grab and go downstairs.  I knew it would be expensive.  I didn't expect over $50 for two sandwiches, a salad and two bags of chips.  We went up to our room and it was nice but was freezing.  We went to change the thermostat only to find the display was shattered and I guess somehow we were able to turn it down or off.  The room itself was nice, with plenty of space to spread out.  I also appreciated the large bathroom counter so we could all spread our things out.  We all slept pretty good but due to the;4
Always clean and fairly quiet, this location is right in the heart of Times Square and the theatre district.  Rooms are nicely appointed and never disappointing.  Sadly they removed the revolving lounge overlooking Times Square years ago, but it's still a nice cocktail lounge for drinks and a munch.;4
I have stayed in Hilton Pasadena, Hilton Glendale and Hilton Universal, quite regularly.  Among the three, my preference is Hilton Universal, then Hilton Glendale, with Hilton Pasadena the least.  @ Hilton Universal, gold and diamond HHonors members are provided with complementary continental breakfast and appetizers and beverage in lobby lounge, not the case in the other two.  Its breakfast has a lot of choices, including dim sum (probably more for tourists from Asia).  Also, as a premium Hhonors member, I have been welcomed with a fruit basket and bottle water every stay.  A small refrigerator in room can be handy at times.   Not much to do in its immediate surrounding area except the Universal Studio the hotel is next to.;4
This was a graduation gift for my dtr. The complimentary breakfast is exceptional and the staff are friendly and eager to help. The night staff at the front desk Devon & Michael are down to earth and funny. Special thanks to the gift shop guy he is awesome he helped us find our way around on the metro i saved so much money. The only negative is the day staff at through front desk Gisel Hernandez she needs to improve her people skills and is very unprofessional i had to refrain from telling her off. Despite the 1 bad apple we had a wonderful time for my first time in LA from Brooklyn.;4
We stayed at the Jane in Jane st, in the trendy Meatpacking district, on the advice of friends. It was great advice!  Loved the decor reminiscent of old style shipping...apt since the survivors of the Titanic stayed here when they came ashore.  Pick a captains room-'it's big enough for two - yes it IS New York, so you're not going to get a baseball pitch sized room.  But is is certainly not as small as we feared.  In room safe, xo lime try bottled water, in room frig, air con  and fan, a table and chairs, and ensuite.  On site cafe, free wifi and - best of all- free and plentiful bicycles.  We cycled for hours  each day and we're pleased to arrive back to a friendly welcome and a choice of dozens of nearby cafes, delis, restaurants, the waterfront and the highline.;4
I was a little worried about staying here after reading the reviews. The location is amazing and a 5 minute walk to the tube. Although the rooms are small the beds were comfy and cleaned when we asked. Due to us having 2 big suitcases we asked reception and they let us store them in their cupboard. The toilets were spotless the only downside the carpets along the corridor were a little out dated and smelt a bit. I ate once for breakfast and it was lovely. Staff were all very friendly and helpful.;4
At the steps of Lincoln center, with great food, staff and amenities. A little pricey for the average traveler - but then what isn't in NYC? Staff exceptionally helpful, and the location is central and walkable.;4
Hotel empire is a nice hotel with a fantastic location easy to get to everything. $10 to get a taxi to hell kitchen, 5 min walk to Central Park, Starbucks a pharmacy and store in the same block so its great for sight seeing early morning starts and also great to start nights out. They have a brilliant late night roof top bar but the problem with it is if ur on the top floors you won't get any sleep at all they should think about a sound proofing them floors. They need to finish decorating and fixing up some little broken and unfinished bits here and there as well. The staff are friendly and will help in anyway they can unless its there mistake and they will blame you or your travel agent;4
Overall, the venue served its purpose. It is a stone's throw from the airport and the shuttle bus was convenient. I was sick upon arrival (coughing and I'm sorry for it) but the receptionist gave me the look of disgust when I coughed. I get it, haha but still, made me feel uncomfortable and detracted from the service.Housekeeping was great and the rooms were ok. Pillows and bed were a little hard but I was able to sleep well.;4
This hotel is a bit thin on services, but the location makes up for this. We walked almost everywhere we went for 5 days. Hundreds of restaurants within a short walk.  Rooms are a good size in comparison to other NYC hotels. Be aware there is no room service or breakfast. In our 5 day stay the room was only cleaned once, by a rather surly maid who appeared at 3pm......the front desk were pretty useless, but doormen excellent.;4
Chose this one be cause of easy walk to Lincoln Center - no fighting for cabs needed. Elevators were broken Sunday morning a serious negative ! The price is high enough ($375)  to cause me to shop around next time.;4
The NewYorker is situated beside Madison Square gardens a stones throw from Times Square. We were warned before we went that nyc hotel rooms are small and yes they are but as you are just sleeping there it really wasnt an issue. The check in process was seamless, great security, helpful staff, nice bar. Happily recommend this place if you are in nyc;4
We had a fabulous time staying at this hotel recently.  I was worried about booking this hotel before we arrived due to the negative reviews. Yes, the rooms are on the smaller side and the elevators are slow .... But this is New York people! These things are expected. We stayed in a junior suite and did not find the rooms too small for our needs. It is a beautifully refurbished hotel closely located to everything you need - shopping, subway, midtown, Central Park, Lincoln centre etc etc. the restaurants around this hotel are amazing and  the rooftop pool is small but handy for us with two young children to cool off after a day touring the city.  The concierge was extremely helpful in securing us tickets to sold out shows and a great table to Nobu.  I must admit there were some;4
We had a lovely stay at the Hilton Universal City recently and would definitley go back.  The rooms are a good size and give a nice view over Los Angeles. They were very clean with very soft beds and large screen TV's.  The location is brilliant and only a five minute walk to Universal Studios and City Walk. There really is no need to get the shuttle bus. You are also only a 10 minute drive from both Hollywood and Warner Brothers Studios. Both will cost around $15 by taxi.  The staff were always extreamly friendly and very helpful.  The only reason its not 5 stars is because of the elevators. There was many a morning where we had to wait a good 5 to 10 minutes to access one and frequently had to walk down the stairs, on the 9th floor this wasn't ideal.;4
The Hyatt Regency has been refurbished with pleasant rooms, and well suited to a short transit stay. I stayed overnight in a King room.  Double glazed windows so the room is whisper quiet. Good dining options right through the night.  Complimentary shuttles run continuously to/from terminals (look for the Hyatt Regency bus, and please tip the drive $1-2 for this efforts).;4
We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during the Christmas season. The room was very comfortable, clean and newly updated. The bed was firm but comfortable. The room was small (most NY hotel rooms are) but the space was maximized efficiently. The location was very convenient to Penn Station which was nice because we flew into Newark airport and could take the train to this station and then had a 1 block walk to the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street (important to us coffee drinkers), however, there was a Keurig Coffee Maker in the room. Empire State Building, Macy's, Madison Square Garden are all close by. The staff were very helpful and made sure that we had what we needed during our stay. For example, our first room was in a poor location and they let us change to a;4
Visited with family for 16th birthday celebrations, having emailed the hotel to inform we were treated to a suite on the 40th floor, amazing views. Great location, very good value for money. The coffee at tick tock was the best we had in New York. Very clean and friendly.;4
The lobby was well decorated with nice fancy colors. The lift was small, and took a long time to each floor. The room was small and the heating wasn't working. The bed and shower was very good. Jeff was very helpful compared to the staff on reception.;4
We booked this hotel because it was close to Penn Station and the theater we were going to.  For a Manhattan hotel, we thought the value was very good.  Our room was very spacious by NYC standards and the amenities were very nice.  The one thing we missed were shelves in the bath room.  It was an accessable room so perhaps they didn't think shelves were necessary.  The staff were friendly, courteous and efficient.  They accommodated our every need.  We've stayed at more expensive properties in Manhattan and they were not as nice or roomy as the New Yorker.  A high probability we'll be back when we come to NYC.;4
I recently stayed at the Empire hotel and had  a great experience. The location is great with Central Park only a block away and a short 15 minute walk to time square. The room was a little small and the bathroom was even smaller but the service the hotel provides more than makes up for it. With so many things to see and do we had no need for cabs and we found New Yorkers to be very friendly and helpful when we needed information on the area. The front desk helped us plan our tour bus which is a must when traveling in new York city as we were able to see all of the most beautiful and important sites. It was a shame that most of the museums were shut because of the government closer but we still found plenty to do.The restaurant next door is a nice place to go after a long day;4
Handy to subway and only 5 minutes to Hollywood Town, clean and quiet.  Staff polite and helpful.  A bit rundown however renovation were in progress.  Breakfast was good and I admired the speed of the chef who handled the crowd quickly and had a good word for everybody.;4
"Rooms are good size and very comfortable. The food amazing! We ordered room service for breakfast and dinner and both were delicious. Never tried an avocado toast as delicious as the one at Hilton. Same goes for the stakes and seafood! The hotel has the perfect location; you can either walk or take the hotel shuttle to go to universal studios or city walk. A big thank you to Jasmin at valet she was terrific at recommending a tire repair shop close by the hotel save us a lot of time and trouble.";4
Super location for seeing the sights, close to Central Park, Lincoln Centre and Metro. Beds are very comfortable but bathrooms small and not a huge amount of hanging space if you are staying for long. Very helpful and friendly reception staff and plenty of nearby eateries. Didn't realise Ed's Chowder house was accessible from Mezzanine level - would have been helpful to have this mentioned. Try The Smith over the road for breakfast.;4
I am sure it would be very difficult to find out another accomodation with that reasonable price, pretty spacious rooms, clean and nice staff but, the elavator has been fixed while we're staying, seems took a long time though. Also,wish they provide just a bottle if water with friger will make it way better beautiful>;4
Opted for the discounted room upgrade and loved it. Largest hotel room we've ever stayed in. Loved the added touch of the welcome gift!!;4
After reading these reviews, my partner and I called Priceline, and demanded another hotel (afraid of it being illegal/in poor repair/getting locked out). Priceline told us that we should try the hotel anyways, and to call them if we had any problems. Well, maybe they just made an extra effort to make us comfortable because we called, but the hotel was an AWESOME value for the money. It was clean, the room was great (the kitchenette was actually a mini-kitchen), the location was safe, and there is free street  parking. It sucks you had to pay more for the internet, and to leave your bags, but we only paid $100 for what we thought was worth at least $160/night.   Either the other people who stayed here were snobs, or they gave us amazing treatment after the call in. Either way,;4
Really enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker.  The location is convenient to Penn Station.  The room was clean, the beds comfortable and the staff friendly.  Mohamed upgraded us to a room with a view.  It was nice to watch the Empire State Building change colors.;4
Nice hotel directly at Penn Station, small rooms, but everything clean, always busy, loud lobby, no hotel for romantic stays, good and fast breakfast in hotels restaurant âTik Tock, nice and good bar...;4
I came to NYC for four nights and did not want to spend the fortune that most hotels cost here.  The Morningside Inn is a part hostel/part hotel.  I requested the Double Deluxe Room and it was really nice for what we paid for it, very affordable.  Our room was behind the office right as you enter the building, which was odd, but the room had two double comfortable beds and a fairly spacious bathroom.  The window air conditioner works great and kept the room very cool at all times.  Also has two dressers and a closet for clothes, plus a mounted tv in the corner of the room.  The only problem I had was that the shower water was luke warm at BEST and the shower leaked very slowly onto the carpet right in front of the bathroom. I never saw anything in the hotel besides the entryway,;4
I continue to return to the Empire with my family.  It's in the perfect location.  Access to everything, and a ton of restaurants around.  Walking distance to the Central Park.  Great place if you want to hit any parades.;4
Good sized rooms, right at the doorstep of LAX, close to good restaurants, very friendly and helpful staff and a nice bar and lobby area.  For us, this stay was ideal--not ridiculously expensive, very clean, the entire staff could not have been nicer and we slept very well before an extremely long early morning flight the next day.  We definitely recommend.  Some of the rooms have nice views of the airport.;4
I have read so many reviews about this hotel...' the elevators take forever', this and that... I must say that I have worked for several hotels in my life, which gave me knowledge about the business and its 'backstage'. So...this is NOT a 5 star hotel! That said, it is in the BEST location to me, an opera lover who goes to NYC specifically for that (and also some wondering around, stop at Tiffany's and little shopping :) oh, women!). The front desk personnel is usually NOT friendly, BUT the rooms are usually bigger than NYC hotels and again the location is almost unbeatable. Price is fair. The bathroom is sort of small, but hey, again, you cannot have it all (to have it all, you must pay a lot more, so...) . It is clean and I have had 'neighbors' that were Met singers, so it was;4
The Empire Hotel is so close to Lincoln Center that you could go back to the room during intermissions if you wanted to. Our double room was small as most rooms in NYC are . It was very clean and quiet even though it was on the broadway side. The water on the nightstand with a very large price tag proclaiming a $7 charge if we drank it was a negative to an otherwise nice room. (i must add that the tap water was pleasant tasting.) . Checkin and checkout were quick and staff were friendly and pleasant. We did not have our cat with us this time but pets are welcome for a fee.;4
I heard mixed reviews about the hotel, but it is very nice.   I have stayed in first class hotels many times and this one falls way short of that, but the price and location can't be beat.  Staff greeted us warmly upon check-in, there was a free mini-buffet in the evenings at the bar, rooms were clean and ready when we arrived and there was always someone there to push the elevator button for you!   The hotel was not overly large, allowing a nice feeling.  Also, if you want to go to Universal Studios, you can just walk there (or take their shuttle - but remember the shuttle does not leave until 10:00 am and the park opens at 9:00.  There were many people waiting outside before 9 am for the shuttle and apparently did not know.)  We walked and were there in 10 minutes.  Perfect;4
Some of the furtinure and room equipment should have better maintainence. Overall quite satisfied. Great location across from Lincoln center. The lobby and bar was nice with good happy hour. Wifi is an additional charge which is unfortunate.;4
Were very happy to stay here, the area is very nice. Once we arrived we were greeted by Sherry at the front desk, she was very nice and gave us a room with a great view. Hotel Lobby is pretty nice and has very good music playing all the time. The rooms are very nice and cozy but small as are most in NYC. The one thing that was a pain were the elevators, most of the times coming down they stopped on every floor and there was no one there, they were also on constant maintanence. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC for business or pleasure.;4
Stayed here 4 nights but booked only really for sleeping in. Our room was pretty small & basic but had everything we needed. No tea/coffee facilities in room but you can get for an additional fee. Lobby very grand & good security as they ask to see your key before you get to the lifts so felt safe. Great view of the Empire State Building from our room. Room cleaned every day & fresh towels left. Great location as only 10/15 minute walk to Empire State Building/Times Square & right next to Penn Subway line. Couple of restaurants attached & plenty cafes/fast food places close by. Madison Square Gardens just across the road. Friendly staff & would stay again.;4
This was my 2nd stay at the Empire Hotel and once again the experience was a positive one.  Although this hotel has a high priced nightly rate, charges extra to use Wifi in the room and for any food/drink used in the well-stocked mini-bar, the quality of the hotel, the courteous and helpful employees, especially the Concierge, and its convenient location to many nearby musical venues make it well worth the cost. I would stay at the Empire again in the future and would recommend this hotel to others.;4
Good: The front desk is much nicer than other Wyndham hotels. It's also pretty interesting to see The Tesla Room if you are a science fan.  Bad: The hotel is a bit crowded but I guess that's the price you have to pay if you're right next to Penn Station. The room is small even in New York's standard.;4
Booked this hotel for 1 night in July. The room was clean, well appointed but probably one of the smallest I have ever stayed in. The bathroom looked dated but was also period which I think made it more charming. There was a diner downstairs (Tick-Tock) which was modern retro, 60's style. We only had drinks but enjoyed sitting at the bar watching people walk by outside.  I would stay here again if I could get for the same low price.;4
"Apart from the queue to manage to get in ( if you're a girl that can be fast ;-), everything was surprisingly good.The bar was easy to access, it didn't take to long to get a drink, the prices were average, the lavatories were clean...and the dj played a song for no more than one minute and changed - the atmosphere was total New York party ! The average age must be no more than 25 though - so if you' re looking for older mates, avoid this place.";4
We stayed here on our first family trip to New York, and it wasn't too bad at all! When we arrived there was a bit of mayhem with the suitcases, it seemed they were a little short staffed for the amount of people checking in but all the staff were friendly so this didn't matter a jot! The rooms were clean, comfortable (albeit a little dated) and we had a cracking view in our room too. Because its such a big hotel prepare to wait for the lifts a long time in busy periods! We were only here to sleep really as you don't waste time in a hotel room when in New York but it was perfect for what we needed and would recommend! Its not far from the Empire State and has a good restaurant too!;4
Love to come here for business and holidays - great stuff but hotel still need some refurbishment Very central to most of events restaurants and shops Will come back for sure to test the bar on top of the building;4
If you are looking for a hotel near the Universal Studios, this is it. The location of the hotel is just a block away.The hotel also provides complimentary shuttle to Universal City Walk.   The staff was very friendly. The kids loved the pool. The pool opened till midnight which was a plus. I wish the self parking fee was a bit cheaper. Overall, we had a great time.;4
We stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights. Arrived very late on a Sunday night and were checked in quickly. Arrived to our room on the 12th (top) floor. Room was very small, we did only choose the standard. Iâd read on previous reviews that the rooms were small but didnât expect it to be that small. There was no desk, just a trunk kinda thing to fit one small suitcase on. Probably didnât help that the mirror took up a large amount of space in the room, it was huge! Bathroom was lovely, clean and the shower was fantastic. Obviously itâs a given that New York is a noisy city and you could hear a lot of the noise in the room so I would suggest if you are a light sleeper, like me, to use earplugs.  We actually changed our room for the last night as we were getting married on the last;4
Very pleased with the accommodations.  Exquisitely appointed modern interiors, lighting, and details.  Concierge very helpful.  Mixologist/Bartenders very knowledgeable and gregarious.   Roof top parties, dining and lounging âoff the chainâ.  Great place to stay.  Not a great gym in the basement - the only downside ( not congruent with the accolades above) but back to the positives 2 complimentary water bottles in your room each night    4.8 stars out of 5;4
Stayed here whilst visiting Universal Studios, short 10 minute walk to the studios from the hotel. Standard room was comfortable, clean and spacious however is in need of some modernisation. The lifts were getting modernised during our stay. We didnât include any meals into our stay but had to walk through the huge buffet every time you wanted to leave the hotel and on our arrival it wasnât ideal trying to navigate your way through the crowds for dinner with our suitcase. We used the underground parking facilities which were easy. Also 10-15 minute walk to a train station which we took into Hollywood.;4
Overall, an excellent value and location for NYC. Beautiful lobby, great friendly staff. Minor confusion at check-in but fixed quickly. Internet coverage was just ok. Room was very clean but bathroom sink and shower were significantly clogged. And luggage rack was wedged in closet by iron position. Little annoyances but you can't find much better at this price.;4
I stayed for 10 days and felt very comfortable here, especially travelling solo! Hotel is clean, room spacious with 2 queen beds and a balcony, facing the courtyard. I slept very well here, felt safe. I didn't rent a car but the metro is 2 min walk from the hotel and I used it to get everywhere! Only a couple of stops away from Hollywood Blvd and a short walk to Sunset Blvd where you can catch buses. I had no problems sightseeing and getting around LA without a car. You can catch tour buses to get you to lots of places from Hollywood Blvd! I went to Santa Monica, Venice beach, Malibu, very easy to get to Union station to take the Amtrak which I did too! There are some very cool museums in LA to check out. I also bused to Getty center and Griffith observatory. Easy to get around;4
Reasonable size room for a central Manhattan location, with good amenities and great staff at the hotel. Majid on reception was exceptionally helpful and couldn't do enough to help us find our way around New York. Reasonable breakfast prices, clean room and quick check out. You are 5 minutes walk from Times Square and Central Park and a 3 minute walk from the subway.;4
I Stayed with my wife and 2 children for 2 nights in April. I will write an honest review to help families mostly. Positive points. 1- Location can't be better 2- Very clean 3- helpful staff 4- Good value for money  Negative point The family room has 2 double beds but the beds are small in width compared to other double beds we found in other hotels in other cities or countries. Each bed should be at least 20 cm more in width. We are slim people and found it a bit tight. It would have been a bit more difficult if we were a bit more built up. I am not sure if other rooms are similar!  All in all. Good value for money with excellent location.;4
The hotel is msall and charming, the rooms are not big but spacious enough. Bathroom is tiny, but works well. The staff is very very friendly and amicable willing to solve issues and help out at any moment. Location is perfect if you like the are and if not, you are so close to subways which makes everything close.;4
I stayed at Ameritania for 5 nights. Great location, with walking distance to Times Square. The room was very clean, and the staff friendly and ready to answer any questions.  My room was very close to the elevator shaft, which created some issues with noise (very loud banging), however a pair of 33 dB ear plugs fixed it overnight, so I still had good night's sleep. To be honest, the girl at the reception offered to change my room in the last 2 days, but I didn't think it was necessary. It was probably still better than any room facing the street, with all the traffic noise.  As a lot of people are commenting, there is no free wi-fi in the room. Their Internet service provider offers 1 and 3-day packages, but the information about the quality of the service is pretty vague, or;4
Trip was good. The rooms were big, the staff was nice, and the hotel was generally quiet. Had no problems with the workoutroms, and breakfast in the morning was fast and delicious. Sonia and Oralia were excellent servers at breakfast time!;4
Considering the fantastic location (not itself beautiful, but close to lots of Manhattan's top sights) and the cleanliness and efficiency of the place, this hotel offers visitors pretty good value.  Our bedroom was quite small and we were tripping over our bags a bit, but the bathroom with shower was a decent size and modern. The A?C was noisy, but worked well. The bed was clean and comfy and, if you are in the city to be out and about rather than stuck in your room then this place could suit you well. If you're just after a good bed in a good part of town, this will do nicely!  Yes, we'd go back.;4
I got a really good deal at $75 a night through Expedia for two persons in a generously sized room with two queen beds, a writing desk, mini fridge, coffee maker, TV (that was too complicated for a TV) and an iron. The bathroom is a good size, but the sink area located right above the toilet bowl with a very tiny space to place toiletries on makes a fumble risky & plain annoying.  Didn't deal with the staff much, as we were out all day, but from the limited interactions I found them pleasant.  Located in downtown Hollywood, a block away from the metro, it wasn't hard getting places (though the public transport in LA is very limited) and it was about a 20min train ride from Hollywood & Universal Studios.  Overall, it is a pleasant hotel to stay at, but not at full price. I can't;4
We stayed here May 2017 for 5 nights and found it to be in the perfect location. The reception desk were very friendly and helpful, we reported a broken towel rail in the morning and by dinner it had been fixed. We found Geoffrey the porter the best!! He recommended places for breakfast, area's to visit, what to do when it rained and also told us they are able to arrange a nice car to take you back to the airport. FYI the Cascade diner about 200 yards down from the hotel does a fabulous breakfast, I would also recommend the Stage Coach Irish bar which is just around the corner from the hotel on 7th Avenue. The only problem we encountered was the noise, do not expect a quiet nights sleep. We repeatedly checked the windows to see if they were open as they kept no noise out at all.;4
"Perfectly located.  Rooms adequately sized and very clean.  Good value. While we did not go to the rooftop lounge, it seemed to be very popular.  Concierge was very helpful in getting us to the right subways and attractions.  Rooftop ""pool"" however was more of a lap pool, so not great for kids.  Ed's Chowder House a great restaurant.";4
Very nice hotel, not in the best of neighborhood (so just be careful). Clean ( do watch for the ants) Real nice breakfast with a variety of things served.  Made to order omelets and the chocolate crÃ¨me waffles are to die for...close to metro that will take you to Hollywood bled, etc. about 15 mins from Universal. Hidden secret. Go on the roof and you can see the Hollywood sign.. Very nice court yard also has store inside to get some great souvenirs. Staff was great;4
My girlfriend and I were looking to spend a weekend in Manhattan and decided to book a studio at Yourstay Central Park. We wound up getting put on the 14th floor, near the top of the building. The apartment was well furnished and the included amenities were clean and well-kept. There was ample closet space and an extra blanket and two extra pillows were provided. The building is also located conveniently close to a supermarket, which we stocked up on food at. The price was great, a little over $100 per night, and it was a very nice experience overall. Being a studio, the apartment was rather small, and the bathroom was TINY, but this was not a problem for us and shouldn't be for solo travelers or couples.  In the complaints department, there were some minor things that were;4
My wife and I stayed for an overnight while visiting Universal theme park. We stayed on a Sunday night so that we could visit the park early on Monday. The check-in was fast and pleasant.   We were given a corner King room on the 21st floor. I believe the room was remodeled in the past year. It seemed fairly new. The room was spacious with lots of ambient light. The bathroom as large as well with a counter for the coffee maker and a single sink. The tub/shower was OK, though I would prefer a shower stall...water pressure was excellent. The amenities were the usual Peter Thomas Roth and included a mouthwash and shower gel. Closet was large and included robes and slippers.  The King bed and bedding was very comfortable. Nightstands on both sides of the beds with lamps including;4
The hotel is centrally located to the Hollywood attractions.  When we first pulled up, we were a little concerned about the location.  Once we stepped inside, we were pleasantly surprised.  The decor was nice, clean and spacious.  The room was a little smaller than expected, but worked out fine.  The bathroom was spacious.  More counter space and/or shelves to place personal belongings would be helpful, but for the price I really can't complain.  We had a nice balcony that overlooked the lovely courtyard.  The breakfast selection was more than expected...fresh fruit, pastries, juices and more.  Sonia and Hugo were very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to ensure our breakfast experience was special.  The omelets and waffles were delicious!!!  All of the hotel staff;4
To be honest, we were a little concerned having read some of the reviews of the Empire. However, we needn't have worried. The location is excellent right by the Lincoln Centre and close to 5th Avenue and Central Park.  Our room was small (as they all seem to be in NYC) but well maintained and everything worked. Great shower with good pressure. Staff were excellent especially Dennis on the main entrance who sorted out our transfer back to JFK.  No there isn't a breakfast service at the moment but Starbucks is a few steps away and we don't eat much at breakfast anyway. Lots of nice restaurants close by. The lobby bar has a good atmosphere and bartenders who actually remember your order the next time! We'd certainly recommend the Empire.;4
The location is great for Time Square, Central Park, Lincoln Center  The rooms are a bit small but comfortable.  The lobby is very nice and the customer service was wonderful.  The pool is extremely small!! However the rooftop was awesome.  Great view and nice seating areas. Check in and checking out was a breeze.  Would like to say thanks to Pasquale for going the extra steps to make us fell welcomed. My only complaint was we like to bring a small cooler in our room and they did not have an ice machine. So purchasing ice at the Duane Reade downstairs added up. All in all I got a great price on Priceline and it was really worth it.  Would stay here again.;4
We stayed at the Astor on the Park for three nights in february. It was a lot nicer than other places I have stayed in New York and had a lovely bathroom.  I can't understand people complaining about how far out it is, surely this is something you check before you book? You can pay more to stay in the centre of town if you want. The same goes for there not being a restaurant - they never claimed to have one. If you want one - stay elsewhere!  All the staff were friendly, the room was cleaned and there were fresh towels everyday. It was lovely and warm which was great considering the freezing weather!   The only fault really was the noisy heating. You could hear it clanging and rumbling at night but it didn't bother us that much. We were pretty tired by then anyway! It might;4
Excellent location, nice and helpful staff. The hotel is a bit worn around the edges, e.g. carpet, chairs/sofas in lobby, etc. Sir conditioner in room was noisy. I expect more from a $200+ a night hotel.;4
I have just returned from a fantastic trip of New York City. My first stay was at a hotel from hell on 106th Street before my sister introduced me to the Morningside Inn hotel on the Upper West Side. My nearly 3 week stay there was a breath of fresh air compared to the previous hotel. It was clean, quiet the staff was efficient and friendly and the manager is an absolute gem of a person.  There was a phone and fridge in each room and a kitchen, fitted with a stove, microwave and cupboards on each floor. The common bathroom was shared by four rooms but that was ok as i never had to wait. The room had window AC which was a bit loud but bearable and the window in the room couldn't open. The location is excellent as it's within walking distance to restaurants,  a supermarket,;4
If you dont want to pay top dollar and aren't fussed about a glitzy hotel in midtown then this is the place for you. Yes the rooms are on the smaller side but this is always the case in NYC. Our room was cleaned to an excellent standard daily, the bathroom had an excellent shower and hairdryer.  The location of this place is fantastic. Grand Street subway is a 2min walk away and provides great transport links. Chinatown is on your doorstep, Little Italy is less than a 5min walk and great shopping can be found on Broadway less than a 10min walk away.  Good breakfast bagels can be got from the shop/deli on the opposite corner of Forsyth for a fraction of the midtown costs.  I would certainly stay at this hotel again.;4
The location to Lincoln Center is the key to staying at the Empire Hotel.  Right across the street! Make sure you register all guests by name so that they can get replacement key cards if they deactivate when held near cell fons! I had no clue that key cards deactivated from proximity to cell fons.  I found out the hard way. Time, NOT well spent.   The roof top bar is great and the staff friendly.  There are many eateries within a block of the hotel.;4
I was stuck in New York because of a train scheduling problem going back to Washington, DC. The hotel was close to the terminal and the name WYNDHAM is so iconic, it seemed like a save haven.   The check-in was welcoming. They found a room for me with no notice and got me the best rate they could.   This hotel lived up to the Wyndham name and I would stay there again (with a reservation next time.);4
This is a classic NYC hotel from the gold 30's that still has a lot of the original features. The rooms are confortable (we were upgraded to a suite). They have nice beds, a Keurig coffee maker, good wifi and a walk in closet. The bathroom is good, but small comparing to the size of the room. The staff was very polite and nice as well.   The best thing: the location! Just across MSG and Penn Station, which subway connections to go virtually everywhere. Near several restaurants and bars, as well as great shopping options, like the classic Macy's.  The worst: room service was not up to the quality of the hotel. We asked for breakfast in the room and it came in plastic and papers bags, eggs in an aluminum plate, all cold. Not what tou would expect in a 4* hotel.  I'll definitely;4
"This Hotel is in a perfect location.The History behind this Hotel is facinating. I didn't know all the celebrities who have stayed there. My favorite team the NY Yankees stayed there in the 40's. Nicolai Tesla had a suite there for 10 years and passed away there. There is a great diner downstairs , ""The Tic Tock"". I would definetly stay there again.";4
While breakfast was good it was very much over priced. We found a local place that was excellent and very reasonable . Its less than a mile away and called Good Neighbor.  Hotel needs some updating. Our shower knob got stuck and our bed fell off the frame in top corner.  Seems like it was a queen frame but double bed. Why do they even put doubles in hotels. They are way too small for comfort. And the room could definitely accommodate queens.  But is still it was clean and roomy. Plus had pretty views of the city!  Pool was nice but doesn't catch early evening sun and was too cold for Spring Break   Cabana were a nice touch. Valet is very prompt and efficient. Roll away crib was also overpriced.;4
"Rooms are small but adequate given the central location. Re-modelling did wonders for the place; 20 years ago it was a real dump based on one stay.  Lots of history displayed in various spots throughout; take a tour of the basement to see among other things the tunnel to Pennsyvania Station.";4
The Empire Hotel was beautiful. Loved the decor in the lobby. As an artist, I was very impressed with the large abstract art in the hotel. It was very in line with compositions I have done on a smaller scale. Very inspiring to a late bloomer from Winnipeg, Canada. I was always presently greeted coming and going between adventures by total gentlemen at the front doors. They were kind and informative and answered all my questions thoroughly. And I had a few. A big thanks to Chris, Aziz and Eugene for making my wife and I feel so at home during our three days at the Empire.  I believe I left friends behind in NYC after our visit. Real professional team all round. Our first visit to The Big Apple will definitely not be our last. Save us a room for next time. An awesome adventure.;4
Stayed here at the beginning of this year, was a lovely stay and the staff were so kind. The room was a nice size however the shower didnât work very well and water came out of both the bath tap and the shower head at the same time causing very little power in the shower water. Other than that our stay was great, this hotel is so close to the Empire State Building and Times Square! Itâs also not too much of a walk to 5th Avenue.;4
Stayed here on business for one night and had a good experience.  Updates are nice.  Had a nice king room with a great view.  Only problem was the toilet ran all night and it was so late that I did not want to call maintenance so I just put up with it for one night.  Staff was very nice and very helpful.;4
Busy streets, a lot of landmarks very close, staff/doormen helpful. Overall great stay. Few minor things that I didnât get ie coffee was downstairs none in room. Bar was closed one night no explanation.;4
Staff went the extra mile to get me the room w/ shower stall I'd been promised.  Of course it would have been better had this happened at check-in but the lady was positive no such room existed.  I was perplexed and gave her the name of the reservationist that promised me the room. So...after going to my room I get a call from her saying she was mistaken and indeed the newly renovated rooms did have shower stalls.  We moved and all was well (some folks just can't safely get into a tub/shower). Turns out she had not been told about the new rooms but took it upon herself to get to the bottom of it as I had been assured they existed when I reserved the room.  Good effort but it shouldn't have been needed had the front desk been kept in the loop on the room renovations. Hotel itself;4
"After booking and then reading the reviews in depth, we were worried about staying here... an online video review on youtube helped to calm our worries though.   When we arrived however we were suddenly very aware that we had nothng to be worried about; at $80 a night for 2 - in an amazing area of Manhattan - you get a fair sized room, tv complete with crappy american tv, a fridge, an amazing table/lamp, aircon, and a clean double bed (squeeky). Room service tidys the room and makes the bed (I imagine they change the bed sheets for new guests and long stays)   The shared bathrooms were lovely - and alot cleaner than some of the reviews suggest, on check in (3 in the afternoon) the bathroom was immaculate and well presented. You share with about 4 other rooms though I never saw";4
Can't beat the location, elevators need major overhaul, too many people always waiting in lobby to get on. Need a full shower door or curtain, water spills on bathroom floor.  Staff is wonderful from concierge, front desk to cleaning staff.;4
After a very early start and a long journey from the London we were absolutely exhausted when we arrived. The reception staff were extremely friendly and they were able to check us in early which was very much appreciated!  The hotel is nice and clean as was the room. The room was small but from the research I had done this is normal in New York. Plus we weren't planning to spend much time in our room so it didn't bother us. The only thing I would say is that the air con was quite loud but it wasn't a huge problem.  Loved the rooftop terrace and pool area. Lovely views and a perfect place to chill after walking round the city all day.   The location was perfect for us. It was about a 10-15 slow walk into Time Square. It's right near the  Lincoln Center and 5 mins to the;4
Woo go is a great place to stay if you want a reasonabll cheap place to stay in NY. Very close to subway, three minute ride to Times Square, great supermarket down the road. Can't understand bad reviews. This place is NOT a hotel. If you want room service and your bed made up everyday, book into one! It's like a little home away from home. Make sure you ask for an upper floor, no noise!;4
Nice hotel, clean and very comfortable. Central position. On the day of leaving, we asked to the reception for two times to put the ground floor toilette in order because it was blocked but none did it.  It is not good for someone to leave in the last day.;4
Think of New York, think of the Empire State Building, and rightly so. Although not as tall as expected and the views not as spectacular as the TOTR, the ESB us still a must when it comes to NYC. Unfortunately you can't do the button pressing scene from Elf as you go up in different elevators, but the build up and views are worth a journey.;4
Just a few minutes walk from Universal Studios, with alternative option of free shuttle bus service.  Less than 10 minutes walk to local metro & bus stations.  Good views of Hollywood hills from room. (NB: not of the Hollywood sign, which is on the other side of the hills.);4
The lobby of the hotel was nicely decorated with Art Deco.  The staff was friendly and worked to solve problems.  The rooms were nice, but small.  The location was great and you could see the Empire State Building from the hotel and Madison Square Garden is basically across the street.  The subway is just outside of the building, so it's very convenient to get where you want.;4
great location, clean secure & friendly must recommend   walking distance from Penn Station. walking distance most of attraction staff was friendly, Missed tea/coffe maker in the room. must provide room service as well;4
Our flight got into LAX at midnight so it was nice that we didn't have to travel much further after a very long day. It's just a short shuttle ride from the terminal to the hotel. After a long day of travel we were ready to go to bed. Unfortunately the room didn't have soap available, so we had to wait a while before we could properly wash our hands. We had breakfast in the dining room the next morning, which was fine. If I had to stay overnight at an airport hotel I would look elsewhere before staying here again.;4
Parking was worth it, Staff from valet parking though check out were courteous and helpful. I enjoyed the art deco style. I thought the bathroom had charm. And the view was the Empire building! It was close to the theater. I did not get a chance to check out the gym, and the only disappointment was no pool;4
Good value. Hotel continues to improve. Top floor bar a nice experience. Front desk clerk Pasquale at definite plus. Doormen always there. Rooms clean and on last visit the heating system worked as designed.;4
Great location to Universal and Citywalk..no need to drive and find parking! All a short walk away. Nice rooms and a great free breakfast with many choices if your an Honors member. Bar stayed open later for us after getting back late from Hollywood Horror Nights!;4
Felt like a first class hotel without the price, really unusual price tag for this part of town. Easyaccess to Central Park, Metropolitan, Columbus Circle. The hotel even has a rooftop bar and pool !!;4
Initial contact and check in were excellent , the ladies on the desk were very pleasant ,we had a room overlooking the courtyard which was small but sufficent , secure parking although there is a charge per day , shops are close by as is the subway which is a great way to get around and breakfast daily was great;4
I got to the hotel early (11am) so I could spend the day out with my friend in Manhattan. I didn't get any sleep on my long flight (with a layover in Atlanta), so I was actually falling asleep in the lobby waiting for my friend to come meet me. The front desk staff was very nice in offering early check-ins for me and another couple that were waiting for check-in time (3pm). I gladly took what was available so I could get a much needed nap before exploring the city. The elevator was busy with housekeeping using the 1 elevator, but I still didn't wait too long for it to be available for me to use. The housekeepers were friendly while I passed them by to get to my room. One of them even helped to make sure that my room was ready before I walked ion the room and bringing an extra;4
The pic you see is the back of the hotel. Itâs a nice hotel with great breakfast! The parking fee added on another $130. If it werenât for the breakfast I would give it 3 stars. The outdoor pool was very cold.;4
Great location, perfect for Macy's, Empire State Building, Maddison square garden and Times Square etc. We were on the 27th floor so had an amazing view too! Only bad thing I'd say is that the bathrooms were really in need of updating and the bath ran cold water. Would have appreciated tea and coffee making facilities being British instead of having to run over the road first thing in the morning to get coffee and also I've never stayed in a hotel where they charge you to store your luggage. Found that rather strange! All in all tho, great stay!;4
we needed a  hotel near our daughters west side apartment. the empire fit the bill . close reasonably priced and a great restaurant on premises . amenities were ok though the shampoo and  shower gel containers could be larger and really wifi in every room not just lounge not unrealistic but the price was right. rooms were clean checkin easy and nearby amenities accessible;4
Hotel was very nice, located right where we wanted to be near the Lincoln Center.  Also within walking distance to many attractions.  Enjoyed the roof top bar.  Although the room was a little small, it had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.;4
Whole experience was really good from first to last day. Bar staff very friendly and Ali on the front dest was very helpful. Champagne for our anniversary & my birthday was very nice surprise. Location was perfect and all staff very helpful;4
We stayed almost two weeks at the hotel. The overall impression of the hotel is that it is a hotel we would recommend.  The reason for our recommendation are: 1) Central location. Located just accros the Penn station. 2) The staff was very helpful. Mohammed was especially helpful. Our son had some medicin that required to be kept at max 5 degrees celcius. Mohammed arranged that we could get a refrigerator brought up to our room. 3) The speed and stability of the free internet was good. 4) Nice bar  The only not so positive was: 1) The bathroom was not so big 2) The hotel looked a bit worn.  It's a hotel we would use again in case we come back to New York.;4
i love to enjoy my holidays! and Hilton makes it even more intresting;4
"Used to live in NYC and have been trying to find a decent comfortable hotel in a good location for multiple trips. Mariana Mero, a Front of House Manager at The Empire who took care of me while I was there, has helped me make a good choice for the future; I will return.  The Empire Hotel reception staff were attentive, exceedingly good natured and helpful even though when I arrived the hotel was sold out and heaving with a wedding party.  My first room was on a low a floor and lacked sufficient closet space and drawers for my 10 day stay. I was moved the next day to a much better room on a higher floor with more daylight.  Ok the 60's style dÃ©cor is out of date but the room was comfortable and clean as was the bathroom.  Housekeeping was accommodating in providing additional";4
The staff was friendly and professional. Muhammed checked us in and upgraded me to a room on the 30th floor that had an outside patio which was truly an unexpected bonus for my daughter and I. A friend came to visit and lobby security gave me a quick call to make sure it was ok. Look past the small rooms to notice the deco details of the architecture, and you won't be disappointed.;4
Great night stay for the $  very helpful staff. We were able to store our bags at checkout and go on our tours of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. Location is awesome, close to subway and a straight shot down to battery park for our tours. A bonus was leaving at rush hour and being away from the thickest part of traffic. Quick exit and ride home.;4
Pros,we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights lovely hotel still has original features which we liked our room was big enough for us and clean hotel staff where pleasant concierge was helpful Cons,only downside they is no kettle in the rooms so you cant make coffee/tea breakfast consists of pastries and coffee and a peice of fruit but if this not enough you can buy breakfast I think other than that they is a McDonald's directly over the road from the hotel & the hotel is quite central to all amenities tube buses tour buses etc;4
Very centrally placed hotel from the 1930's with a rich history,  some of which is told in an interesting display on the lower level. I was there for 7 days initially and was lucky to be put in room 1951 with a great view towards the Empire State Building and a little more space than some other rooms. Housekeeping is efficient and the rooms are clean and well maintained. On checking in a week later for my last night in New York before leaving the US I was asked to the Members check in desk.There Mohammed (I hope I have his correct name) was very obliging and arranged room 3730 for me with a view over the city to the Hudson River. A very nice way to say goodbye to the city. I ate at the Tic Toc diner on a number of occasions and the staff were always pleasant and obliging. On my;4
Great location for the Observatory and Greek Theatre.  Just 2 miles away.  Staff if friendly, and rooms are clean and well furnished.  The breakfast buffet and omelet station are awesome.  Many thanks to Hugo, Jose, and all the staff!! A+ (gated parking available for s daily charge);4
We spent five days recently at the Empire Hotel, the hotel is well sited within five minute walk to Central Park (we saw the parade at end of the block). 15-20 minutes to Times Square and there are two subway stations with three blocks of the hotel (20-25 minutes to Wtc on the subway).   Hotel is a little dated but our room was cosy and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful and my pregnant wife appreciated the fan to help keep her cool at night (the roof was warm even though we switched off the heating).   Wifi was available in the lobby but not the room itself (unless you paid extra), it would be a plus if it was available in the rooms personally.   A number of shops are nearby (Apple, Gap, Bestbuy) and Starbucks is on the corner. Opposite is a really nice Italian;4
We stayed at the Universal City Hilton for 2 nights in April.  I was very pleased with the location (convenient to Universal Studios and Universal City Walk).  The check in process went well and the service at the front desk was excellent.  The room was very nice and even though we were only on the 7th floor, we had a nice view of the Hollywood Hills.  No noise could be heard in the room from the freeway down below.  My husband visited the Starbucks coffee shop down in the lobby area twice and said that the employees were not very friendly and borderline rude.   The bar has happy hour with drink discounts and free snacks.  The bar staff were very friendly and attentive.  They have a shuttle that will bring you to the entrance of Universal, but we waited (along with several other;4
"The location was superb. It was a beautiful hotel with a fairly accommodating staff. The late check out options were a bit bizarre. We requested a 2 PM late check out which they declined. It was a long shot so I am not mad they could not accommodate but they offered a bizarre option to get 3 PM check out for $75. We could have gotten another night for only $100 so it seemed a bit steep to offer 4 additional hours for 75% of another night cost. Like I said I am not going to mark them as bad for not offering the option but the cost to ""buy-up"" was a little steep considering the price of the rooms available.  The hotel was gorgeous. They are remodeling the hotels facade so that is something to consider but the interior feels like you are stepping into a 1920's lobby with a bunch of";4
A central NY hotel with a story, right by Macy's and easy to get everywhere ! Quite roomy by NY standards, great staff, a good gym and 24 hour deli ðthe staff are very security conscious which is reassuring too;4
I booked this as my final leg of the Adventure, I finally got to see USA.  The hotel is about an hours walk from the Chinese Theater I should know as I walked there and back. It was okay walking there in the middle of the afternoon but I would not recommend walking back if you are doing it after 5pm as I'm not frightened of anything but some of the people (beggars etc) that seem to come out after that time can be pushy.  The hotel was a great base if you want to use the tube to go to either Hollywood or Universal Studios, I did this a few times when I was there and never felt threatened.  The hotel itself offers a breakfast and fitness facility but I never felt the need to use the latter.  Just outside of the Hotel down to the left is a great Teriaki Takeaway food shop. I wish I;4
First of all, this Hilton does not have an executive lounge. Which in my opinion is one of the biggest fails possible. Its a big hotel, a lot of conference rooms, ball rooms, people traveling for fun, but business also, and no lounge. So even if you book executive room, it does not mean you get something extra, except spacious big room, maybe better view. Second thing - very crowdy, noisy lobby. Its not a problem of the hotel necessarily, but the occupancy is high. Lines for breakfast, as well as checkin are normal. Room was bit older, but spacious. However between doors to other exekucite room - which can be connected as one suite are doors with very bad sound isolation, so we could hear everything from the other room. No sauna, steam, only outside pool. I am used to the fact,;4
The Americana is were I try to book first when I travel to NYC. It is clean and comfy and so close to lots of interesting city amenities. Central Park, Theatre district, Times Square, good restaurants are all close by.;4
This hotel impresses when you step inside , it's a bit of glamour from the past. Check in was welcoming and efficient , all the staff were professional and polite. Our room was fine, spacious enough and clean, would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room as we were there for a few days. Some of the decor in the hallways on the way to the room need refurbishment , it looks dated and tired. The wifi is excellent a big plus when travelling with teenagers and is free, wish more hotels could achieve this . The hotel is located close to everything you need in Manhattan, we like to walk so this was a real plus. Will defiantly visit again when in New York.;4
This is similar to most city hotels.  The staff are really friendly, the hotel and rooms compact and very tidy and the bar a bit pricey.  You're not in the UK so don't expect to take home loads of tea and coffee sachets, because they don't provide it.  As during our other stays though it worked to our advantage.  We were there for a busy sight seeing trip so no coffee in bed meant we were up and out to get breakfast in the city.  There was a really nice pub/restaurant next door by the way.  My only grumble with this hotel was the noise.  We were on the 8th floor and, I think, the back of the building.  Even with the window closed I could hear the rumble of the air conditioning units on the ground below.  The air con in the room was also too noisy for me to have on at night so it;4
"We stayed in a suite on the 32nd floor for three nights. The front  doorman, the front desk staff, the baggage check staff, and especially the housekeeping staff was great! Very kind and accommodating. The room itself was small, but clean and in the classic style of decades ago...which is not my own preference, but the ""throwback"" atmosphere made it feel like old New York, so while the room wasn't up-to-date and modern, it was comfortable and a place to rest. One negative was that the drains in the bathroom sink and tub were slow, so water backed up into the sink/tub...of which I informed the front desk upon checkout. The location is awesome, close to shopping (Macy's and 5th Avenue is within walking distance) and close to Times Square and the Empire State Building. The attached";4
We stayed here one night because we needed to attend graduation at Lincoln Center. The hotel was fine but I'm not sure why it was 4 star. The bathroom was redone but the shower floor was kind of old and gross. The bar in the closet was so high you need a step ladder to reach it. The charge for coffee on the room was $3 but the cream is powder. Yuk. I would say stay there if you can book a premiere room under 300.;4
I like each  room design, it does reflecting the hyoe of Broadway theatres around. Ecen if you dont get room with a view,  your room design will give you sense that you are living in Broadway area. The staff are very friendly and everything works well.;4
When we first arrived at the hotel we were kind of nervous. We walked into an existing argument between a hotel patron and staff. It got really heated. However we were helped in a professional and friendly manner. The parking was well lit and had ample space. The area where the hotel is situated was safe and in a decent area. We did not encounter any problems whatsoever. The hotel was very close to all the areas we wanted to visit like Beverly Hills, Venice Beach, Santa Monica Beach, Walk of fame etc. So we loved the location. The hotel amenities were great like free ice, sauna, pool, Excellent free breakfast and spectacular views of the city on the balcony's. We stayed on the 3rd floor so it was really quiet. In fact we did not notice any noise throughout the entire hotel;4
i walked from vermont/sunset station and entered the lounge area.people having a great time! thought how nice it was to be back to socal. checked in, found my room which was huge. everything worked, balcony, free soap, clean, no bugs.. all of that night plus enjoying the laughter,singing los angeles. then back up in a few to shower and feast. thanks to chef hugo and his staff, noted by previous review... voted best breakfast in town walked to chla for a conference in 2 min, repeat. poked around found pool, gym, an awesome balcony on 3*. smooth check in . smooth checkout. free printer for air pass;4
Excellent location, right next to subway station on 96th & Broadway, which takes you on any train to 42nd street (Time Square) which is the main station, so from there you can get on any subway line. Hotel was basic but clean with wifi. King sized bed was massive and comfortable. TV seemed to have a relatively good selection of channels available. Desk in the room if you need one. Air conditioning unit, but even with -6 outside the room was quite warm. Only downside was the lack of power points to charge my devices (phone, camera, table, back up battery etc) Luckily everything has USB charging and I have a 5 point USB charger so I could do everything through 1 power socket. Bathroom was of good size and amenities were provided. Rooms could do with a lick of paint, to modernise;4
This boutique hotel is across the street from the Lincoln Centre, so plan ahead and see what's on. Normally plenty to choose from. Columbus Circle is close by too. There is a Starbucks just on the corner and a Duane Read next door, great place to pick up bottled water and bits for your room. The bottled water in your room for the coffee maker is $7.50, a fraction of that in the pharmacy. We had a great time from the day we arrived, 29th April 2014, until our last night 1st May. The roof lounge which is a heavy part of the advertising for the Empire is rented out to another company. You access it via the lift in the entrance foyer. We where on the 10th floor room 1022, had great views,  but just a few floors away from the rooftop and a party was held on 1st May with a music;4
We needed to be at Boulud Sud across the street for a party, so the hotel location was absolutely perfect.  Two weeks prior we stayed at The Muse near Broadway and could not drive down the street and were delayed an extra 30 minutes in traffic.  This location put us walking distance to Columbus Circle and we even walked the 1.5 miles to the theater on 42.  Leaving 42nd after theater is impossible to get a taxi, so it was good to be close enough to walk, but far enough away from the craziness of Times Square.  The staff was friendly.  After a 5 hour harrowing drive, there was a valet to greet us.  He wanted to warn me that the charge for valet was $70 which we did because we were tired and late and he said the garage was six blocks away.  My mother had a room that was small and;4
Pros: Nice clean hotel with very good service. Pleasant staff. Rooms spotless. Beds very comfortable. Cons: Complimentary internet doesn't work. The evening buffet at $85/person way overpriced for an average buffet -- even by LA standards.;4
Stayed here for 4 nights in December location is great. Rooms are small but usually are in the city. Great bar area and Starbucks on your doorstep. Never got to see the pool,as it was closed for the season. Would recommend this hotel and I would happily book it again;4
We booked our room at the Ramada because we got a really good rate of $67.50 a night though the hotel website.  This was a promotional rate when you stayed 3 or more nights, we received a % off.    We were in a Queen bedroom.  My only complaint was that the room was really small.  I'm sure the king and two bed rooms are larger but we didn't see them.   But for the price, I really didn't care about the size of our room because it still had everything you need even a small fridge and a microwave.  The hotel is nice and clean, but you can tell it is a little older. We had a small balcony and could even see the hollywood sign from our window.  There isn't much in walking distance.  If you have a car the location is convenient to all the attractions.  The hotel includes a free;4
My family had a wonderful experience at the Hilton. The location was perfect for Universal. The rooms were clean and spacious. And the staff was awesome! The restaurant downstairs was great as well. One morning my son wanted something that wasn't  on the menu so the waitress called the chef out and he made his breakfast as specially requested. We will make this our hotel of choice when we are in the area.;4
Awesome location, which gives it an incredible value. The entire customer service team there is extremely helpful. The only downside is that the rooms are a bit small, and there is a little outside noise that woke us up in the middle of the night. But all in all, it was great for a weekend stay.;4
I admit, I was worried after reading all the negative reviews on Tripadvisor. So, here's my report after staying there: it's perfectly fine. a safe, convenient location. there are many restaurants and a Starbucks within the block. there's a 24-hour pharmacy next door. the staff is friendly and helpful. our group check-in was well handled. the building is older and undergoing external renovation. there is scaffolding in front. the lobby is nice and comfortable. two elevators are in service, two are out of service. the wait for an elevator was never very long. the stairs are safe and convenient. my room was older, but the bathroom was updated and new. the free internet worked both in the lobby and in my room.  It's a Days Inn, not the Ritz. It's an older building, not a roadside;4
Great room. Very big with two queen beds. Great location for visiting all of New York. Just a straight walk to time square. Staff were helpful and always there when you needed them. It was a stones throw from madison Square garden and the bus terminal.;4
The Hilton LA Universal is a nice hotel, in a great location about 7 mins walk to Universal City. The rooms are good and spacious and the hotel is nice in general. They are investing and upgrading it but this leaves it a little untidy. The elevators are very slow!  They are upgrading the key cards to RFID and, whilst they did drop a note under the door, they only gave on key card which meant a 5 min wait for the elevator up, find the key was changed, another 5 min down to reception. Then a 15 min queue to change keys then another 5 min up again - not what is needed after a hard day!;4
Professional warm and friendly lady upon check in on the 28.3.19 and a lovely guy. Very accommodating placed my room next to my friends. Friendly concierge and porter on the door too. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to New York. Anyone looking for somewhere to stay in New York I highly recommend. It is a 10 minute wall to Times Square and a great view of the Empire State Building from your room!;4
Spent our honeymoon at the New Yorker, check in was pretty easy and all very friendly I did e-mail in advance to see if they could do anything as itâs our honeymoon unfortunately they couldnât but we were promised a bottle of wine when we checked in and was told this would be in the room in 10 mins, it never turned up. The hotel is dated and in need of a refurb, the room was on the small side and walls quite thin but kept very clean by the maid. The staff were friendly apart from one desk by reception that kept saying they had a free gift for us and asked every time we went past. The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing. Disappointed with the honeymoon bit but overall I think we would go back again.;4
Had a lovely 2 night break here. Great location, very central. The hotel is like going back in time and I'm sure it was very grand once upon a time. The rooms need updating and the bathroom facilities are to be desired. I managed to set the fire alarm off after the room filled with steam after an attempt at getting the shower to a usable temperature. The shower/bath was at least 30 years old and in need of updating. Despite this we would stay again as the location was spot on and we didn't spend much time in the hotel itself.;4
"Hotel is very nice and spacious. Breakfast was great; even if you just get continental as the have fresh orange juice. Room service is quite pricey but they had a really good happy hour in the bar area. It is a quick 5 minute walk to Universal Studios Park or you could take the tram that comes often. If you buy your tickets on the park website you get in an hour early. Seriously the best time of year to go; no lines.";4
After my most recent stay, Hyatt is my preferred hotel in the LAX vicinity. The rooms are all updated, spacious and well designed. WiFi is fast, there are plenty of power plugs and USB ports everywhere, TV screens are supersized, showers are huge and beds are comfortable. Shuttles are a 5 to 15 minute ride to the airport depending on your departure terminal. And make you have a meal at the hotel restaurant: it is surprisingly good.;4
Enjoyed staying here and it is super easy to get to/from Universal Studios, even with small kids. Service was friendly and our room was well appointed. Service was good as well. There is a shuttle to/from Universal City Walk but we didn't always use it was a very close walk to the park.;4
The room was tiny but big if you were a tall ship sailor.   The ship like cabin was cosy, adequate, clean, quiet and cleverly laid out.  It had all the bells and whistles of a regular hotel room except for a shower/bath room.   The latter was offered just down the hall, and was sparkling clean.  The check in staff was friendly and helpful.  The (early) check out staff was efficient.  I paid $147 for a one bed-room, all taxes included.  The hotel is a short walk to/from the subway.  I would stay there again.;4
Location was perfect. Trendy touches to make decor edgy. Friendly and helpful staff. My room was above a bar so it was a little noisy and one of the windows faced a brick wall. Other than those minor things, good hotel!;4
Good hotel, nice and confortable rooms, very good free breakfast, nice swimming pool. But the rooms should be more soundproofed : all external noises were quite disturbing, both from the street and from the inside of the hotel (slamming doors). Private parking available but slightly expensive (10 USD/night). I would like to mainly thank the 2 receptionists at check out on August 24th, Nicole & Beatriz, who were kind enough to extend our check-out time with no additional charges.;4
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel and had a very pleasant stay. The staff was very nice, The hotel room was of a nice size and clean. The bed was very comfortable. There was a gym and a pool. It included a very good breakfast (with omelet station). The location was convenient- right near the metro which takes you either to Hollywood or the other way to Downtown LA. We were also close to the Griffith Observatory by car.The only negative for us would be the $22. per day parking fee. I would recommend this hotel to others.;4
Always enjoy staying here since the location is so great. Room renovations were great. Rooms still a tad small but that is NYC for you. The only complaint I have were the gnats in my bathroom.;4
Stayed for 2 nights while we visited Universal Studios. It's only a 5 minute walk to the front gates of Universal which has a shopping centre just outside with plenty of places to eat. Easy to get to other LA locations from here. Great continental breakfast was included but for $10/person you could upgrade to a full buffet breakfast - well worth it. We self parked our car for $28/night which is very easy-valet for the extra $$ not value or necessary here. Very happy with this hotel and would stay again.;4
Stayed for 4 nights in April, and it was a fast and efficient check in.   Stayed on 8th floor and room was a great size with a very comfy bed. No problem with noise either!!   Breakfast was expensive ($24 each) so we ate out every day. I was also a little miffed at the transport desk, as my boyfriend and I like to use public transport to keep costs down and to really experience it wherever we go. However, they weren't willing to help us out, and instead made us feel as though our only option was private transfer.   Our first morning we were visiting Warner Bros 15 minutes away and chose to get a taxi, which cost $25 including tip, but after the tour our tour guide told us how to get a bus from there to Hollywood for $1.25!!! Amazing!! After this, we did our own research with;4
Deducted a star from this cute boutique only because they DO NOT answer their phones! I called for over 2 hours two days in a row and could not reach the hotel. Only when I called the 800 number and they transfered me did I get through. Desk is not manned all the time. Otherwise it's a great hotel. the rooms are extremely small with full size rather than queen size beds. Clean bathroom and rooms. Lobby is really nice and active bar scene. Roof top bar closed during a recent visit. Door men are wonderful and helpful. No uniform so it was hard to distinguish their position. Updated bathrooms. Wifi is an additional fee. A/C worked well.  Plenty of eating within blocks of this small hotel. GREAT location directly across from Lincoln Center - you can't get a better location. Would;4
Lovely lobby! Room noisy at night! Lincoln Centre round the corner, Central Park down road opposite. Restaurant good, nice buffet breakfast, & chowder!! Suppose to have free Wifi in roof bar, but not open when we were there! had problems with lifts when we were there!!;4
This hotel probably has one of the best locations in the city. From here you can get subway access to pretty much anywhere in on the island and surrounding areas. The New Yorker has a very nice old school classic charm to it but I think your overall experience will depend on what type of room you get. We got upgraded to a classic queen suite which was very nice but the bathroom was very small (you had to close the door to be able to get to the toilet paper and I could sit on the toilet and wash my hands at the same time). We didnât spend a lot of time in the room since we did a lot of sight seeing in the city so it didnât bother us too much.   Based on location, I would probably stay here again as it was so convenient with Penn Station basically right outside (wish the Knicks;4
Great location.  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  Easy check in and out.  Would like mini fridge in room.  Had a great view of the city from our room. Beds comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.;4
Overall we had a great time!!! Unfortunalty it was cold we couldn't benefit from the pool. We stayed for three nights and each time we came back to the room it was clean. The toilet did get clogged but we took care of it. We saved on breakfast and ate at he hotel. I feel like parking should be included in the price its California and all but we didn't pay to stay at a motel.;4
Me and my mum stayed here for 5 nights in Jan. The hotel is an excellent location on the corner of 34th street and 8th Ave.   The room we stayed in was on the 27th floor, it was a bit on small side, but that didn't bother us, as we were only use the hotel as a base.  The room was lovely and clean, and cleaned everyday. The only small complaint that I would make is that the room was a little on the cool side, obviously there wouldn't be an issue with this if you stayed in the spring or summer.  All the staff were friendly and super helpful.  The hotel is in a excellent location, with Macy's just a short walk up 8th Avenue and lots of eating places within short walking distance.   Overall and excellent hotel, I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again;4
We stayed at The Jane for almost a full week in one of the Captain's cabins and really enjoyed our stay. The staff are all very charming and the pillows, oooh those pillows, so soft I think I had some of the best sleep I've ever had during our stay. The roof top bar's outside area needs a little work and the food in the cafÃ©/coffeshop is very boring, also be aware that sometimes, never quite understood when and when not, there's a real nightclub happening in the hotel and the place is just jumping...all part of the fun. I suggest almost everything else in the neigborhood from breakfast at Bubby's, The Whitney right around the corner, The High Line, late night oysters at The Standard even Samsungs Flag Ship store down the road is well worth a visit.;4
"Enjoyed our stay recently at the universal hilton. Certainly can't go past the location. The hotel is clean and well maintained. My only gripe is the fact that my party of 3 arrived from a 15 hr flight from Australia, arriving at 8:30 in the morning. Jet lagged we were told from front desk staff that we could not check in til 4pm and our bags could be held if we wanted to venture to city walk...um no. I couldn't walk 50 metres without feeling completely knackered :) we crashed in the foyer with our bags. I was called over shortly saying a room was now available but I would be charged $25 for an early check in fee. I had no choice to pay it. Is this stated anywhere on their website? Maybe the hotel could have a ""lounge"" type room where early international visitors could crash and";4
2nd visit to Empire, perfect location for CP.. room good although a little tired, pool open seasonal months - watch out, I went in mid September and couldnât use it, very disappointing.  Overall for a the location, value is good and rooftop bar / lounge very appealing.  Would recommend.;4
We stayed in this hotel for 1 week. Its in a great location, near the subway to go down down or uptown. Very close to central park and a short walk to times square. The pool area and bar is great ( though was closed over labour weekend due to high winds ). Room was a good size we had the king sized room ( we got a free upgrade from a queen size, reception staff were very friendly so thanks). All staff were friendly and accommodating.;4
Excellent location for visits of New York and the Met. Subway Station within short distance to the Hotel. Walking distance to Central Park and MoMA.  Several Restaurants serving different expectations. Safe area.;4
Nice clean hotel......close to public transport. Nearest metro station St Monica. Comfortable.decent breakfast, low noise level. Close to many restaurants.no restaurants m the hotel so had to order pizza ';4
We booked through Hotwire so got a great deal. It was a short walk to the Lincoln Center subway station and made it easy to tour the city. The rooftop deck is neat. Clean room, fun decor. Nice stay for a quick 24 hours in NYC. It would probably end up being cheaper just to valet, we parked at a garage around the corner and it was very expensive.;4
The rooms are small but that's normal for a NYC hotel unless you want to pay loads for a suite somewhere! The bar was nice to sit in and this is where the free Wifi was so gets pretty busy. The rooms could do with a lick of paint but was clean that's all that matters to me :);4
This hotel is perfect location if you are planning a visit to Universal Studios. Its got a free shuttle bus to it but there is no need as its only a 5mins walk. Hotel is typical Hilton and the price reflects that. Its very big, rooms are clean and big but slightly dated and can be a bit cheesy.   Staff are super friendly - from bellboys to reception to car park attendant. I asked the bellboy about prices for the theme park and not only did he go out of his way to find out but he also gave me vouchers for $8 discount off the ticket price.   Requested a king bed but when we got up to the room it was 2 twins. Told the reception and they changed it within seconds with no hassle. Only thing to complain is that the parking is a bit expensive, $17 per day for self parking. They also;4
People at the check-in/check out counter look very professional but don'T be fooled by their looks. I puchased 2 nights stay at Hilton Universal Studios through GETAROOM.COM, 3 months before departure from Australia.   AU 410.03 (including conversion commission of AU 11.94) was taken off my American Express account that very day.                                                 *************little problem********** Arriving very early at the hotel on April 15, 2012 after 14 hrs flight from Brisbane our room was not ready of course, 6:00 am too early. They put our luggage at their storage, no problem. Like zoombies my husband and I went to the Universal Studios across the main road to kill the time. We came back to the hotel at 1:00pm, had meal at the hotel and were pleased to be;4
We stayed in a suite on the 30th floor. The rooms were very large which had a small kitchenette which was handy. Very clean and tidy. The only thing they sold us when booking in was WiFi on a daily charge but we then found out that you could free daily usage anyway. We didn't incure any other charges. Thye supplied bottles of water, tea and coffee daily which was great. We ate out every day so can't comment on food at the hotel.;4
Perfect location when wanting to visit Universal. Stayed in a corner room which was big and comfortable for a family of four. Check in was simple with the staff who were very friendly. Underground on site parking was available for $25 a night which wasn't too bad. The view from the hotel was great as it is on top of a hill.  Highly recommend a stay here.;4
We arrived after a long trans Atlantic flight to find LA right in the middle of a heatwave.  Tired and hot we checked in with very friendly and helpful reception staff.  Unfortunately, on getting to our room we immediately had to request a change as our booking specified we would have a safety deposit box in our room which it didn't.  Hotel is not in a great area, although safe enough, and we planned to be out and about all day so did not want to have to hike around with passports, electronics etc.  Husband had to point out that we had a choice of hotels and we picked this one due to location (to Universal Studios) and facilities offered and we were moved to another room by manager after he checked we hadn't used anything in the original room. New room was on a higher floor, had;4
I've stayed at The Jane twice in the last two years, each for 4-5 nights. I have found the accommodations to be very clean, comfortable and the staff to be very friendly. The single rooms are amusingly tiny, but really...who goes to NYC to spend time at a hotel? The flat screen TV and iPod doc are nice touches for winding down at the end of the night.   The location is fantastic and it's a stone's throw from the 14th Street subway stop, the High Line and the Village and points beyond. It's become a bit of a home away from home when I'm in New York.   If you get a chance enjoy breakfast at the cafe down below. The avocado toast is divine.;4
We enjoyed our 2 night stay. Very clean, spacious room with a nice bathroom. Great location and plenty of restaurants in the area.  If you are a light sleeper it can  get a little noisy at night though.;4
For Hilton Los Angeles Universal City. Nice clean hotel with comfortable rooms. Friendly staff. Early check-in with 25% surcharge (anytime before 1pm). $48 for 2 persons for airport shuttle to/from LAX Airport. However, do not expect to be alike the 5***** Hilton in Asia Pacific, managing expectation. Complimentary shuttle bus to Universal Walk, depending the opening hours of the Universal Studios Hollywood.  Many eating options available at Universal Walk. Safe neighbourhood to live in for foreigners.;4
I chose the hotel because of location and cost. I read reviews ahead of time and knew what to expect. It's not a new facility and it's pretty bare bones. The staff was nice and they carried my bag up for me. My original room was on the first floor and when I was checking in I asked about noise level and he put me on the second floor. The room was tiny and functional without any frills. I arrived in NY before check in and they held my bag with no problem and I checked out before my train departure and they kept the bag again. There are muffins to eat throughout the day and coffee and free water. For the price I paid, it was exactly what I needed.  The lack of elevator kind of sucks but they put me on the 2nd floor and carried my bag up. Hauling it back down the stairs was no;4
We stayed here last weekend (Sat-Tue) and we really enjoyed our first time to London.  + The hotel is in Hammersmith, near to the centre of London. The transportation is good (tube, buses) and there are many shopping facilities nearby.  The staff was friendly, especially the guy who was at night at the reception.  The rooms were clean and simple and we did not have any problems with the bathroom outside.  We liked that we were able to use the kitchen and the luggage room free.   - Everything was ok, no negatives, but only two things to say. The rooms were a little noisy, mainly in the mornings, and there could be some extra things (like travelling sewing kit) at the reception.  If you need a simple and cheap accommodation for a pleasure trip in London we recommed it.;4
Very comfy large rooms and giant bathrooms.   Stayed for one night for universal Halloween horror for the fourth time, and will come back again.   Transferred from Anaheim by train -ok and metro - less so as travelling with suitcases !!   The hotel is in walking distance of the metro but up a giant hill so not at all recommended if you have suitcases.    Scales in the business centre in the foyer - very helpful for distributing weight when flying and buying !!  Staff are helpful and I used the digital keycard quite successfully.;4
We booked while driving into the city via Hotwire. It's always a gamble, but we were pleasantly surprised. The location was awesome- it was so convenient to everywhere we had to be (there for a Bachelorette/ Bridal Shower weekend). The hotel was really nice- the rooms were smaller (obviously, it's NYC) but had everything we needed and enough space for us to feel comfortable. There is a hopping nightclub on the roof deck that I never saw or heard, but always had a line. The gentleman who helped us check- in, Pasquale, was exceptional given that there was a lot happening in the lobby (a pageant or something) and it was late. He gave us a ton of information on the hotel, the local area, and recommendations nearby. The only thing that stood out as negative was the valet definitely;4
Great location- a little hard for cabbies/Uber to find, but has a great energy. Value for the $ spent. Rooms were clean, Bed was very comfortable. The experience was very good.  I'd stay there again if I need to be in the same area.;4
Close to everything, didn't  have to travel far for Time Square on New Years Eve. Corner of Broadway and 54th Street, only a five minute walk to Subway.   Plenty of food choices close by, best part was Starbucks just 5 meters across the street so my mornings started off well.;4
"We travel to New York frequently for pleasure.  The hotel rates have gotten very pricey and we hate to spend a lot on a room because the only time we spend in the hotel room is to sleep and shower.  I read the reviews on TripAdvisor, so I was very leery of booking this Days Inn, but the rate was so low compared to other 2 and 3 star hotels in Manhattan, I figured, ""What the heck...if it's really awful, we'll just stay one night, then move.""  Well, the place was great, for the price.  The room was clean, and rather large for a New York hotel room.  The bathroom had been very recently updated, so it was very nice.  The staff was attentive and helpful.  I really couldn't figure out what all the negative reviews were about.  There were no bedbugs, plenty of hot water for our";4
Great location, close to 34th st Penn station and Madison Square Garden, Macy's and Empire State Building also near.  Room itself was small, no tea or coffee in room, slightly disappointed due to the price paid, However location made up for this.;4
Stayed here with my 16 year old son for our first trip to NYC in December.  Great location. A few blocks from Central Park.  Near to Time Warner centre.  Rooms were small, but we didn't spend much time in it.  In room services very expensive and they charge for wifi which is a bit cheeky.  We didn't bother and nipped downstairs to Starbucks.  Staff very helpful, with good knowledge about places to eat locally etc.  we had no problems with the lifts. Would definitely stay here again.  Can't wait to return to this amazing city.;4
"The Jane is **great for single travelers on a budget**, and I can only assess single rooms -- they're extra-tiny rooms, but very well organized, in the manner of a ship's cabin, so much so that the ingenuity becomes a fun part of the stay. You can fit a surprising amount of stuff in there, and the single bed is very comfortable. (I've seen reports of bedbugs; I had no problems at all. Lines for the bathroom in the morning call for some patience and planning. Light in the small rooms is convenient to operate but harsh.)  There's been a real effort to restore a classic hotel atmosphere to the place that makes it feel characteristic and special from the moment you walk in. You will find out very soon the hotel's interesting connection to the Titanic :-) Since the rooms are so";4
Loved room and location, it can get noisy though as walls thin.  5 stars for Cafe Sierra staff for breakfast and dinner wonderful service for food allergies, nothing too much trouble. Fantastic location for Universal and Warner Bros tours. Our day tour Starline also picked up from this hotel. We caught subway out from Central Union Square. $1.75 each so easy and quick just 15-20 mins.  Very safe to walk over to Universal Walk at night time and there is a shuttle but we walked everywhere. Would return to this hotel.;4
Booked this well known hotel for its position, convenience to Penn Station and accessibility to the sights.  Arrived at the hotel at around 2.00 pm, we were third in the queue.  We were seen by Mohammed, who advised  we were unable to access our room until 4 pm. Whilst we were sorting out the hand luggage to leave in storage, we were pleasantly surprised that Mohammed was able to issue a room there and then, which was great. Initially we were given a room on 27th floor, that was not really big enough to move around with 4 large suitcases. We returned to the desk and saw Mohammed again and asked whether we could possibly move to another room, if we came back after 4 pm, once others had check-in.  He explained that the hotel was very old, and like London, the rooms can be small.;4
The hotel was nice, with a very New York feeling, but the room was very smal though. The personnel was very kind, the place was clean, and had a good location (it was a couple of blocks away of the subway in a decent neighborhood).;4
My boyfriend just booked this hostel without me looking at any review or picture of this hostel. Though this hostel wasn't a dissapointment at all it is clean and has a little refridgerator. Abercorn House has a kitchen where you can prepare your own food (its clean!) In your room you will find knife, forks, plates etc. so you dont have to worry about that. The toilet and showers are for everyone on your floor which means it could get dirty. However this was not the case when I was there, the toilets and showers actually looked very modern and clean!  The location is nice too it is in zone 2 of the London Underground which means when you take the Underground you will reach the centre of London within a couple of minutes only.  TIP: If you go to London for 1 week or more get the;4
This hotel wins the convenience contest. Everything about it is set up to make your LA visit as easy as possible, and in a town where nothing seems easy, that says a lot. The Hilton Universal City is located directly next door to Universal Studios, and our family loved being able to walk out of the hotel and across the street to the theme park.  The hotelâs location just off the freeway between Hollywood and Burbank is perfect for an easy drive to the studios or the glamour spots, Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood Sign, the starry sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard and more.  Inside the hotel, the staff is set up to welcome you. The weekend we visited was quite busy, and the hotel handled a lot of people beautifully by positioning extra people at the elevators and entrances. What;4
"Let's be clear..you stay at this Hilton for the proximity to the theme park. It's hard to beat on that score. Being able to hit the park, come back and rest ( or cool off if it's a hot day) and go back later with little effort is a huge selling point. Views are excellent, our room on the executive floor was clean and well appointed. Maybe a tad underwhelming for the price, but still very nice. Lifts: Slow and being renovated..work in progress so I won't ding them for that; just leave a little extra time. Continental Breakfast: Day One- Just ok, food was lukewarm to cold. Day 2: awful service. 15 minutes before I was asked if I wanted coffee. So, a star reduced there. The layout of the hotel is a bit odd, so ask questions until you get the lay of the land. All in all, a good bet";4
Overall, I give it a four. For what it is, I would rate it a five. It's clean, reasonably priced and has a great location. The front desk staff were incredibly friendly.  They have coffee, juice and bagels for breakfast in the morning. There is also a fridge in the room. That's about it as far as amenities. There is a convenience store within easy walking distance so you can stock up on refreshments. There is parking across the street for an additional $15.    I stayed in the James Dean room on the first floor. It's an accessible room. Not sure what kind of handicap Dean had. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a ceiling fan, which was a nice touch. My only complaint was the television. It was mounted in the corner of the room near the head of the bed. Very hard to;4
Hotel is in the perfect location. Walk to Empire State Building, Time Square, Theater District. Easy access to Subway. Easy to get to and from JFK airport, just take the E train. Hotel was comfortable, room was clean, bed was very comfortable and view was spectacular! Hotel could use some updates with paint in hallways and rooms.;4
Hotel was clean, inviting, lovely.  Queen room was kinda small, but well stocked, clean, and comfortable since we weren't spending too much time in the room anyway.  Excellent location, close to the park and a lot of shopping and restaurants.  Although not entirely intolerable, the heating/cooling system level of noise that other reviewers have mentioned is definitely true, I slept through most of it, but it was definitely noticable and noisy when awake.  I stayed here because of having seen the show GossipGirl.  Worth the experience, would consider staying here again, but there are so many places in the city to see that it wasn't so spectacular I would stay here every time.;4
This was a great property for its value. The rooms were nicely appointed with stylish furnishings, although they were a bit worn. Friendly staff. A request for a new iron never materialized, but it wasn't a big deal. The a/c could not be controlled in the room so it was either a bit too chilly or a bit too warm. The location is excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel.;4
My daughter and I stayed at the Empire Hotel in February 2014 and we absolutely loved our room, the concierge at the front desk named Nick was just so friendly, we were warmly welcomed by him and his team and I really need to also make a positive comment for the guy I hassled on a daily basis regarding taxi, weather, directions etc.  Lovely man and always helpful, forgot his name but always was there to open the door for me when I was going out.;4
This hotel had the perfect location. I took my boys to NYC for 5 days earlier in December and they were able to navigate to Times Square and around the area no problem. Being right next to the Ed Sullivan Theatre and the Colbert added to the cool factor. The room wasn't huge, but we didn't expect that in Manhattan.   We got a decently priced clean, lovely hotel right in the middle of all the action as far as they were concerned. And Jeff the doorman saved me a fortune by teaching me how to use the Metro lol. He was so helpful! He arranged our transport to the airport and made us feel so welcome!  Definitely a great launching point for an action packed holiday.;4
very convenient location, walking distance to many attractions i.e.Central Park, Met Opera, Times Square. The only unpleasant moment was when we asked about extra K-cup of coffee for room (just single kit is provided with one of each: regular coffee, decaf, green and black tea). But we stayed with my husband and needed one more reg coffee and green tea. On reception area we got the information that it would be extra charge $3 for each cup! Seriously?! We were staying in variety of hotels, from Hilton to Holiday Inn, in Europe, Asia and US.  Tea and coffee has always been complimentary, no matter how many stars the hotel had. Empire hotel is not  the cheap place and it looked pretty weird.;4
Stayed in better hotels and stayed in much worse. This is a well used hotel and is clean, tidy and does what you need to it to do . It lacks lounge areas and good restaurants but is definitely suitable as a base to enjoy NYC. The value for money is very good and the staff are helpful .;4
I stayed for one night and booked through hotels.com where I got a good deal for $105 including taxes. If you arrive by car be aware that parking is $18 and change. Staff was very friendly, room was very clean, however the shower was warm at best and the water in the tub took forever to drain.;4
I like staying at the Hilton Universal, but was disappointed this time around.  They charge $7.95 per device in the rooms, not per day.  DISAPPOINTED.  It seems Hilton is nickel and diming. Our baggage was unloaded into one cart from our car.  When I called for it, they had separated into 2 carts.  A nice young kid brought the first cart explain what they had done.  Stunned, a short time later an older gentleman came and tossed the luggage like sacks of potatoes. I was alarmed as my laptop was one of the items.  He then stood there waiting for a tip.  I tipped him to get rid of him.  I would have preferred the nice younger gentleman to have brought the luggage himself.  Room Service lady was rude when she called at 9am.  I did not get a chance to explain anything.  she was a;4
If you are looking for a cool place to have a drink head upstairs to the roof top bar. Nice view of west side, right by Columbus circle. In the winter, the indoor bar area is nice too ... Wine very pricey but mixed drinks fm typical NYC prices. The lobby looks pretty, not sure about the rooms but the location of the hotel is ideal.;4
This hotel is a bit pricey but not considering the location. The rooms are clean, beds on the over-firm side but not too bad, and the location is great. Across the street from Lincoln Center, an easy walk to Central Park, and on the subway just a couple of stops from the theaters. I stay here whenever I spend the night in town. They store your bag for free even after checkout, which is great for a matinee or shopping. The doorman is always there to get you a cab if you want one. The on site dining is nice, especially breakfast, and room service is efficient.;4
Fabulous location across the street from Lincoln Center...smallish rooms and bathrooms (shower only), but that seems to be the NYC norm...very comfortable bed, friendly and accommodating staff (we arrived very late after flights canceled from Boston), reasonable prices. Would definitely stay here again.;4
This is a great hotel, no question. Price was great, double queenbed â¬300,-, incl breakfast for three days. In LA... The hood was very nice, if you go down to Los Feliz, you'll find all kinds of nice restaurants and shops. Hollywood Blvd is around the corner. Oh and they have private parking for an additional fee....;4
"Location, very near (1,2,3) metro: Only 5-10min to Times Square and 10-15min PennSt [->MacyÂ´s] / Tribeca / Soho. 900m/10 min to Lincoln Center by foot. Also near Central Park, Dakota, Strawberry Fields. Nearby many not over-priced good restaurants, Fairway-market (excellent grocery) & other services. Very nice neighbourhood.  We had 17th floor penthhouse w/1 bedroom, spacious living room (with lcd tv), huge roof top terrace with beautiful skyline + bathroom. Next to famous and historical Ansonia building. Small, good enough kitchenette: coffee maker, fridge. Clean - small bathroom, but OK.  Check in/out fast. Reception ordered taxi back to JFK, but no actual ""overall service"" (which we didnÂ´t need). Open 8am-10pm, but 24/7 security.";4
A great stay for a city break for a few nights.  Very convenient location. Quiet room even though quite close to the lifts and main corridor.  Clean and comfortable accommodation. Excellent breakfast.;4
"Stayed here with three kids (15,12 6) so we could visit Universal Studios. Picked it based on previous reviews of walking distance to front gate. About a 10 minute walk even for my 6 year old. Room was clean (eve nsmelled clean)  and roomy with comfy beds.  Very quiet and hardly heard anybody else on our floor!  The only down side was the food. Restaraunts are geared more to adults and not a typical kid. The bonus was citywalk is right there so able to have many choices from fast food to more sit down type nicer places. Hotel does offer a shuttle to universal also. Was well worth the money and priced comparable to other hotels that were in the neighborhood but this one being the ""closest"". Is daily hotel parking fee too.";4
We had a corner king room with connecting two queen room.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The view from the 19th floor was great.  No maid service unless asked for but no towel racks in bathrooms was awkward.  The king room had a large bathroom with lots of floor space and counter space but just a standard tub.  There was supposed to be a concierge but desk was never staffed.  The pool was only outdoors and it was 50 degrees so didnât use that.  WiFi wasnât free for Hilton honors members which was disappointing.  Staff were nice when we interacted but almost always lines at the front desk (we had flight issues and checked in at midnight and no line then).  Elevators were slow and always a wait.   Worth it if you are going to universal but otherwise overpriced for what is;4
We stayed here for one night as a stop over to meet up with a cruise the following day. i and my family could not fault the hotel the room the view or its location. The only let down was the facility charge that we were not informed about. We had no knowledge that we would be charged this fee for a service that we did not use. When we booked in we should have been were of this charge. You pay a fee for a service you do not use.;4
Arrived and booked in, found room to be very small and dark. Requested another room and reception staff could not have been more helpful offered us two other rooms and allowed to decide. Found reception and bar areas very dark almost uncomfortable. Concierge was amazing and very friendly helped book lots for us. Found doormen also helpful, but think that we were very lucky with reception staff who dealt with us on arrival as other requests were dealt with less well during our three night stay. Found the breakfasts very good and lots of choice. Enjoyed time on the rooftop but felt the stair access let it down. Over all experience and stay was good but feel that we were lucky. Attention to detail and better customer service would have made it special like this old hotel deserves.;4
This hotel is old-fashioned but cosy and comfortable - a great location. The best thing about the hotel is the attitude of the members of staff because they are without exception extremely polite and helpful. It felt like good old-fashioned service ! The rooms are pretty basic but clean and comfy. I loved the old style and architecture and the very convenient diner next door.  For people travelling alone this hotel I a good, safe choice. I would book another stay here...;4
We had a corner king room which was very spacious and had a view of Universal Studios which was the reason we were there.  The room was very clean and quiet.  The bed was really comfortable and I slept well (which I usually don't when away from home).  The hide-a-bed was quite comfy as well for my daughter.  Easy to walk to Universal Studios across the street.  Parking was expensive but convenient.;4
"Very convenient to Lincoln Center events; a short walk across the street.  Very courteous staff.  Rooms are clean but small (typical for a Manhattan hotel).  overall, a good value for the price.  This was our second stay and the stay was consistent from one to the other.";4
Although the rooms are small, you can't beat the location, just one block from Penn Station and close to many New York attractions.  My room had a view of the Empire State Building.  The staff were helpful and even agreed to give me an unusually late check-out, which was helpful given the timing of my train travel.  The room was clean and comfortable.;4
We celebrated my niece's birthday in the lounge with about 40 friends and family attending. It was a very sophisticated and intimate location. The appetizers were delicious and the care of our party was impeccable. Gabriel, the manager of our event, was attentive to every detail and was always nearby in case anyone needed him. Our event was to end at 10pm, but we ended up staying until nearly 1am - and we continued to receive friendly service. A very memorable night!;4
Well I made the mistake of repeatedly checking the reviews of the hotel AFTER we booked and started to regret my decision.   Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. We had a very warm welcome and were given enough information. I was happy with the free wifi even though it played up sometimes. The room was perfect, couldn't fault it at all. Bathroom was very clean and bed was comfy.   I didn't go in the pool but I did lounge next to it one evening and it was very relaxing.  The location was great as you could get the bus and metro from just outside. We only put $20 each on our TAP card (like Ldn's Oyster) and it lasted the whole week. The only thing that let it down was the homeless people in the area. It wasn't the safest but saying that, we had no trouble and everyone was very;4
The hotel is right across the street from Central Park and is quiet, our room was large for an inexpensive hotel, and the bathroom was renovated. The staff was also friendly. The only reason to not give the hotel 5 stars is that the hallways are drab and the elevator is slow. But the bottom line is that we will definitely stay here again.;4
America is very centrally located at 54th & Broadway.  Friendly staff, clean rooms, room with King size bed had enough room. Have to pay for in room wifi and small refridgerator.  Great waterfall shower.  Check your towels supply....not always up to par. Overall a nice hotel.;4
Hotel was clean and comfortable,  staff were very helpful. Especially when I left an item in the safe and had to have it posted to me quickly to our next hotel on our trip ð³  The only downside was there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Other than that would definitely recommend and would stay again.;4
Great staff, friendly service, nice Rooftop Lounge.  Downstairs restaurant (attached to the hotel) was excellent for late night dinner after the opera.  The best location for Lincoln Performing Arts visit.  Rooms a bit worn and small.  Overall great hotel.;4
Great to see a concert at MSG. Lots of places to eat and shopping nearby. No fridge in room only downside. Very strict security code hat monitors the door. Three restaurants on site that were very good;4
An enjoyable trip, lots to see and do whilst you are there. Empire hotel us central to most places of interest. It's comfortable & friendly but could do with better air-con and maybe a little freshening up;4
Enjoyed a weeks stay at this hotel.  Great location, Starbucks around the corner & plenty of restaurants to keep you going.  Highly recommend The Smith across the street!  Thereâs a Mexican restaurant opposite the Lincoln Centre thatâs fab too. The food in the hotel is not great, kinda non existent & $25 for buffet breakfast for an adult & $10 for a child we ate out all the time. My room was fine. A little small but perfectly formed.  Our view was out onto Broadway. My only suggestion would be some hooks in the bathroom.  Thereâs nowhere to hang a robe or towel after you shower! The door was fairly water damaged too. Having stayed more downtown before where itâs so noisy at night I was pleasantly surprised with how quiet this area was.  It was so nice to come back to this hotel;4
I was on a day trip to California, and just needed somewhere inexpensive but decent quality to stay for the night, and this place seemed to fit the bill.  I wasn't pleasantly surprised by the size of my room, it was quite large, and included a separate seating area and table as well as the bed, and was decorated quite well and kept clean. The bathroom was a little bit small, and some of the wallpaper was peeling off the walls a bit, but it was perfectly functional.   The hotel is situated on a busy road, but I didn't hear any noise in the evening, and was able to get a decent nights sleep.  I also had a good breakfast in the morning.  I can't comment on the area the hotel is situated in, as I didn't really explore that.  I would stay at this hotel again.;4
We love this place.  We stay here the night before early flights so we don't have to deal with traffic and parking.  The team in the restaurant has gotten to know us and are always so welcoming.  We'll be back again soon.;4
Lovely room with a view and lovely location . Really Enjoyed ourselves and a lot of restaurants nearby to eat too which was convenient for us .   Service was great  and staff were helpful  and friendly;4
I've stayed in this hostel for the third time and would always go there again.  Location: It's only a two minutes walk to hammersmith station, where you can find a lot of shops like tesco, boots and other coffe shops. The hamersmith station has four different tube lines, so it's easy to go to different places in London. Rooms: We stayed in a double room. The equitment is basis, but it was very clean. The toilets and showers were cleaned a few times a the day.  The only this that I didn't like was that the doors closed very loud, this leads to a lot of noise in the morning. Staff: because we arrived late, it was great that they have a 24h reception, the staff was very nice.;4
I checked into the Empire and had some initial problems. The staff, in particular, Romeo, were so helpful. He went out of his way to ensure my stay was comfortable. Having staff that care makes a huge difference. Thanks for making my stay friendly. It was marathon week and very busy.;4
We had a fabulous 5 night stay here recently. We had a room with two double beds and a bathroom and a walk in cupboard/wardrobe which was great to put all the suitcases etc in. The room was not large and the bathroom was small but it is quite an old hotel and so brilliantly placed in New York that space was limited I guess, hence skyscrapers being built there. The wifi worked all the time, we didn't get a chance to use the gym that was included in our tariff and although international calls were also included in our tariff we never could get a line out - small details really. The beds and bathrooms were comfortable and clean. The safe in the room was brilliant. Our views over the Hudson river and beyond to New Jersey were gorgeous and the hotel is so well placed. Subway stations;4
We stayed in this hotel three nights to visit family and tour Universal Studios.  We had a non-smoking double queen room on the Bed and Breakfast plan.  Our room was on the 15th floor and we has a nice view of the valley.   PROS:  We arrived two hours before check-in, but were given a room right away.  The room was very clean and roomy.  The beds were comfortable.  A copy of USA Today was at the door every morning.  There was a snack bar on the Lobby level with fruit, juices, pastries, gelato and Starbucks (no blended frozen drinks).  Universal Studios/City Walk was a five minute walk or a complimentary shuttle from the front door of the hotel was available from 9am to 4:30pm. CONS:  The B&B breakfast was a buffet with nice choices, but at the end of the self serve meal we were;4
"Easy walking distance to all local attractions and right next to a subway station for visiting further afield. Comfortable hotel, spacious rooms, professional staff, not disturbed by other guests or by noise from outside. Clean and well equipped rooms. Had to pay a ""resort fee"" even though we never used gym or business centre but it was worth it for excellent wifi and good selection of tv channels. On site diner open 24 hours and coffee bar / takeaway in foyer but loads of restaurants, shops and take always on the doorstep";4
Really helpful staff, who went out of their way to ensure our stay was the best posible, free upgrade to a corner room.  I would especially like to thank the door staff and Said especially who made sure all our travel needs were catered for.  Location was ideal for transport links and broadway.  Would definitely recommend but be aware New York isnât cheap haha;4
The hotel was fine and the shuttle to Universal was very convenient.  Front desk staff and Luis, concierge, were very helpful.  The dining room for the breakfast buffet was not up to Hilton standards.  The price was much too high and the carpet was covered in food crumbs and spilled food.;4
Hotel is good for a weekend/short break with an excellent TicToc Diner next door.   The hotel is a very good location adjacent to Penn Station, a link to New Jersey Transit/Long Island Railroad/Subway and access to JFK/Newark airports inaddition to the subway to all parts of Manhattan.;4
We have just returned from a 10 day stay at the Astor - a family of four with two teenagers.  We paid $99 a night, so I was a little dubious after reading the reviews on trip advisor, but made a few enquiries and went for it.  The Hotel was what we expected, it was not 5 star, but didn't proclaim to be, so there was no shock there.  We got exactly what we asked for - a high room with a view of Central Park.  The room was quite small, but adequate for the short time we spent in it.  My only gripes were the lack of drawer space and the lack of free coffee downstairs.  We didn't ask for any coffee though to be fair - as I'd bought a travel kettle anyway.  The shower and bath were great.  The beds were made every day and fresh towels provided.  The cleaning staff were cheerful when;4
Stayed at this hotel for seven nights and found it was very comfortable,  clean and quiet. The complementary breakfast is a nice bonus and provides a great variety including eggs to order. The price of the hotel makes it a viable option in expensive LA. The downside is the location which is a little undesirable however the transport connections are excellent with the metro and bus closeby. The pool on site and available off street parking are great extra benefits. Staff were very helpful at all times, particularly Michael G. I would definitely stay here again.;4
Stayed there for two nights since it was convenient to Universal.  Universal provides a free shuttle that comes by regularly to drop you off at CityWalk/Universal Studios.  Unfortunately the ride back makes an extra stop at the Sheraton first but definitely worth using on the ride to the park (saves some walking for the big day at the park!)  Continental breakfast buffet was better than average.  Hotel elevators were extremely slow - only three working elevators for a hotel with over twenty floors!  The room was spacious and quiet.  I noticed they've disabled the elevator chime when it arrives at your floor.  A nice touch since we had a room near the elevator and hearing that is always annoying.  Desk staff was courteous and professional.  Free apples at the desk which was nice;4
I loved the pool , I had a good room for a recent 4 night conference stay. The conference rooms were easy to access, the fitness center looking out on the landing strips was fun visually. Good equipment too.;4
The new improvements to the Hyatt Regency at Los Angeles International Airport are in keeping with the original building's 1964 pedigree.  Originally designed by the firm of Welton Becket ( Architects of the famed Capitol Records building in Hollywood ), the new interior improvements pay homage to the mid-century modern era in which this building was originally conceived. The dramatic Lobby has opened up to the rear of the building and the bar, and the former restaurant has also opened up such that all of the space flows informally together.  There are numerous opportunities to sit or lounge in different areas and enjoy intimate conversations or larger gatherings.  Communal dining and lounge tables also allow one to start new conversations with fellow travellers. The rooms are;4
The Ramada is a little out of the way for main attractions but if you have a car, it is IDEAL. The staff is friendly and the amenities are nice. The room was clean. On Monday's they have a show in the restaurant area. Unfortunately, the restaurant is only open for breakfast and the show. The hotel has a cab company affiliation--which is the nicest set of cabbies! (Maybe it's bc Im from NYC). They have a flat rate and pick you up too! I'd stay here again but not for luxury.;4
Traditional hotel, great staff and superb location (one block from Central Park, two blocks from Columbus Circle, accross the street from Lincoln Center). Rooms and bathroom are small and for an extended stay can be a problem. Gym is just average.Nice rooftop for drinks.;4
We chose this hotel for the superb location as very handy for everything we wanted to do in London. It did not disapppoint as excellent for Thames Rockets and Thames Clipper boats as well as walkable to most places (West End, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, etc). The room was fairly basic but was very spacious and had everything we needed and so quiet considering the very central location. We appreciated the luggage storage facility before and after check-in times as that enabled us to squeeze in a bit of extra sightseeing on our arrival and departure days. We booked the dinner and breakfast deal for Â£26.99 per person which was great value and great food. Our young waitress at dinner was a credit to the hotel and looked after us well. We had expected a fridge in our room which we;4
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Jane.  The location is wonderful.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The room I had was small but no smaller than what I had read about and expected.  If I wanted larger rooms with a private bath, I would have had to find somewhere less convenient and certainly more expensive.  The only negative was that I had difficulty with the TV remote not functioning properly.  I'm not a tech genius but I can work a remote.  The staff apologized and did their best to rectify the situation.  It's NYC...I wasn't watching TV much anyway.  I will definitely be back!;4
this is my 5th time staying here and you cannot beat the location....close to everything....I received an upgraded room when I asked and the front desk manager was kind enough to oblige....it made my 7 days stay more palatable. Very kind of them to do that...I hear they are doing a remodel soon, which should make the hotel even nicer;4
Stayed at the New Yorker 7th-10th June and loved it!! The location is perfect for accessing Manhattan by foot or subway and we had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. We had really easy check-in and outs. Rooms are small but not to the point of being problematic and I loved the Art Deco design and the hotel always appeared clean.  The Tick-Tock diner and hotel bar and restaurant were excellent and we always are well!! In fact I would return purely for the best shepherds pie I have ever had - and that's saying something coming from the UK!!  Beautiful hotel in a excellent location - would definitely recommend to others and stay again.;4
Lovely Hotel..Location is great . Near Penn Station and Times Square..Nice rooms and all the staff we encountered were excellent. Easy check in/check out. Only in NY for 2 nights so didnt spend a huge amount of time in the hotel . Did i mention location !!!! Recomended;4
He Hotel is perfect located for your visit to the Universal studios LA. The rooms are clean and the infrastructure is old but still comfortable. The Restaurant and the Bar are o.k but you have the smell of the cuisine all over the restaurant and the bar. Good place to stay for a weekend;4
Very nice, elegant room. Staff were great and so helpful with attentive waiters and waitresses at the breakfast buffet, which Iâd like to mention was delicious. Extremely comfy beds and beautiful bathroom. I wouldâve given the hotel 5 stars but I feel that despite the modern furnishing, it could do with a lick of paint in places (and there are a few ants about too). Overall, a great place to stay with a metro line just a short walk away.;4
"Love the history, the art deco, the location, the views.  True, the rooms are smallish -which makes me wonder how small they were before the broke the walls and went from 2500 to 914 rooms!  I take it that celebrities had suites.  Anyway, for a night or three it doesn't matter to us; we really just slept there and little else.  The surprise was this.  We had the most basic room booked at a low cost.  Upon checking in, I asked the receptionist for a room high up, with a view.  Normally you pay extra for those, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.  She said, ""I think I have one for you,"" and off we went.  Upon reaching our room, we found that it was the very room occupied by Nikola Tesla for a decade!  (Famous inventor and competitor with Thomas Edison.)  I think he also died in";4
Very good  and reasonably priced for a short stay. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Thw  shower temp.  and water pressure was terrific. Convenient to restaurants and transportation. Wished there was a mini refrigerator in the room to store a cold drink.;4
You do need to worry about airplane noise at this hotel,  I could not hear any planes while in the hotel.  I had a king sized room fashionably decorated in grey,  white, yellow.  The room included a mini see through refrigerator and stylish sofa.  Friendly and attentive staff, including at the bar where I ordered food and at the restaurant.  A downside is the front of the building faces a garage.  I used points for my two nights stay and attended a scheduled seminar at the hotel.;4
We stayed here for 4 nights and loved it. The beds were so comfortable and soft and the rooms were very clean. The pool was nice and warm but they need to loosen up on the strict no pool toy and no jumping rule, kids just want to have a bit of fun. The shuttle service to Universal Studios was really handy and the longest we waited was 15 minutes. Staff were really helpful and friendly and the cafÃ© onsite was really handy. We would definitely stay here again next time we are in LA :);4
I love staying at the Jane hotel when I'm in NYC traveling solo. It is a great concept hotel which makes me feel like being back in college. Tiny but cozy rooms, shared yet clean bathrooms. The West Village location is wonderful. The rates are extremely appealing. My only advise is to bring earplugs for the night - the doors slam noisily and there are many doors on each floor ...;4
"We had been offered an online $20 ""upgrade"" to an executive room and accepted it. The wait at the check-in desk was longer than it should have been, but the clerk was courteous and efficient and we were pleased with our upgrade. Our room was larger than average, L-shaped  with windows on two sides. Room was clean and beds quite comfortable. The bathroom was barely big enough for one person to occupy it. Despite our efforts to prevent it, the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor. Only about half of the elevators were operational but we understand that they are being replaced soon. The revolving door was on the fritz, too, so staff had to man the doors to the vestibule.... and we got a wind tunnel trip every time! We were there for the Westminster show (without a dog) but it";4
"The apartmentâs location was great: nice neighbourhood a walk to central park, lots of nice places to eat , a grocery store round corner and express sub way on the door step.  I was happy with the apartment, it was decently sized with good wardrobe space, the bathroom is on the compact size but the whole place was very clean and the kitchenette was adequately equipped for our needs.  Things I didnât like; paint work was a bit scuffed bringing down first impression, you also have to pay for internet service, the linen and towels were little worn (but clean and fresh and spares provided) and the a\c was a little noisy but you get used to in and in July you forgive a little noise for a cool retreat. I requested my room cleaning on the day before I wanted it (at half way thru my";4
The Jane is a like a glorified upscale hostile. I don't need much space because I'm usually just there to sleep and in NY you don't do much of that either and just want an easy access hotel with a room that I feel safe and clean. The Jane was perfect. Not only was it kept clean on a routine basis but the restaurant and lounge are great places to eat, relax, entertain. Very cool and unique hotel experience and very reasonably priced compared to what else is out there.;4
Overall, it was a good location esp if you are visiting Universal Studios. We could see the place from our room. And the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept on! Also, there was a 24hrs Ralphs (supermarket) just 5min away, so that made us happy.  Other than that, no complains about the room & the hotel except I do agree that the front desk was slow and not exactly helpful.;4
Really good value for money. Good location, had everything we needed and everything else was within walking distance. Also right on 32st penn station which was really convenient! NY we will be back! Thank you;4
I spent two nights at the Jane hotel whilst visiting NYC. The local area is really nice with a cool vibe and a convenient place to be located with the metro close by and many nice local shops and cafes. Before making my booking, I was a bit concerned about the shared bathroom as I had never stayed at a hotel like this, however I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. The bathroom is cleaned constantly and I never had to wait to use either the toilet or shower. I was able to change in the shower so didnât have to walk down the corridor in my robe. The cabin room is small but itâs enough as it has plenty of storage and was clean. I would recommend this hotel and will return if Iâm staying in NYC again.;4
"Few people may know, but this was actually the original Hyatt Hotel, from the 50's. It reminded of the old saying, 'they're very good at what they do, cause they only do what they're very good at"". The hotel does the basics well, service is good, rooms are modern and clean, the location is great.  On the night we were there, the power went out and the staff did a great job of guiding all the guests through the stairwells. They deserve a star or two just for how they recovered from that issue. However, the hotels prices for an entry level room, keep it squarely in the early four stars range.";4
I found the rates at the Empire Hotel very reasonable, and it was really a great stay.  The hotel is in a little bit less busy area, and is two blocks from Central Park.  Great shopping nearby, and Lincoln Center is a great place to have a takeaway breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The hotel is clean, staff are very friendly.  Luis at the front desk was extremely helpful to get me a room at a good rate at the last minute.  The hotel has a nice bar in the lobby, and a rooftop restaurant and pool.  The room was small, like most in New York, and the aircon was extremely loud.  Nice decor and set up in room though.  I like a room with a real shower and not the shower-in-bath set up.  All the normal amenities included.  Really a great stay.;4
"Great ""old city"" type hotel, nicely renovated, spacious rooms, good heat, great location for UWS theatre, Central Park, and Lincoln Center.    PJ Clark's restaurant on street level very nice. Just 5 blocks to Columbus Circle.";4
As you can guess in the title, number one point is the location. Across the street from the Metropolitan Opera, if that is your thing. 4 minutes walk from Columbus Circle. 6 minutes walk to edge of central park. 20 minutes walk to Times Square. I had read some reviews, and here are some comments about some of the things that i had read. We were in a regular one bed room with no view. The room seemed to have been refurbished recently as it did not feel dated at all. The size of the room is really a typical  Manhattan room for me. No desk, or couches, or anything like that. If all you do in NY is visiting and attending shows and concerts, and all you need for your room is to sleep, it will be fine. If you want to spend a lot of time in your room other than sleeping, yes it is a;4
"Overall, this is a great option if you're visiting Universal... less than 10 minutes away which makes a day at the park a breeze. But to call this a 5 star hotel isn't accurate. We did enjoy our stay, but for the price expected a bit more. I booked the Exec stay for my daughter and me. Improvements needed: - Check in time is 4:00 but check out is 11:00 AM! What? They extended it to 11:30 am but seriously, any other hotel where I have status will give me at least until 1:00 pm - The ""executive"" breakfast included in our rate was okay. Didn't include hot items (those were an extra $10). I ordered a latte from the nice man who sat us at our table... the waiter who brought it over told me it was $6. No mention made of the extra charge at the time of ordering. NOTE: If your child is";4
"I truly enjoyed my stay at the Empire Hotel and found the staff to be very polite and helpful.  Jeffrey at the front desk was especially polite & helpful and he was also warm and friendly, as was the bar staff and the one housekeeper I came in contact with.   I had a large, comfortable suite with a great view of Lincoln Center.  The bathroom was very nice and the bed extremely comfortable.  I would have liked a little more lighting in the suite and a full-length mirror.  I was curious why the magnifying mirror was placed so high on the wall - perfect for someone over six foot!  I liked the magnetic privacy ""buttons"" - nice touch and so much easier to use that door knob hangars.  The lobby was quite cool catching the cold air from the main entrance.  These few minor things would";4
Visited here on a two day stopover in LA. It is just a 10 minute stroll right to the entrance to the park, but there is also a shuttle bus if you are just too tired at the end of the day or have small children in tow. What's more, the hop on hop off bus stops right at the hotel entrance so you can access the rest of LA, Santa Monica and Venice Beach without driving or taking cabs (very expensive). Hotel is the standard expected of a Hilton, excellent amenities and good staff. Definitely the pick of hotels at universal city;4
Rooms are simple nothing complex,as I never watch TV it wa refreshing to have rooms without TV, rooms are clean and shower is ok. Fridge freezer in every room but found it a bit noisy so first thing I do is switch it off, great6 if you are spending a longer period of time as there is a shared kitchen. Hotel is close to big supermarket (Tesco) and many venues and access very easy by public transport.;4
We were visiting this hotel for a 3 night stay prior to going on a cruise. It's very central, right opposite Madison Square Garden and about a 10 minute walk to Times Square.  It's a busy hotel and the check in line was huge at some times of the day, however we were lucky and checked in pretty smoothly. The lifts are also subject to you being there at the right time. I was very pleased with our room and we had everything we needed. We didn't eat at the Tick Tock Diner in the hotel so can't comment on how good it was. I would definitely stay here again.;4
Old  and stylish, good location, very friendly staff, clean, good for a rest but not work, rooms are small, a bid overpriced. Many spots in walking distance, close to the Subway, good Diners type restaurant.;4
Our beds were comfortable and the rooms were GREAT! The hotel was close to everything we wanted! The only complaint would be that we thought we heard pipes during different times...sign of the age of the building.;4
The Empire is in a great neighborhood for walking. It is close to Central Park, Lincoln center, and so much more. The staff is friendly and professional and always ready to help out. I have stayed here many times and its always a good experience;4
Enjoyed the convenience of walking distance to Madison Sq Garden and Macy's.  Also nice to have 24hr restaurant in lobby. Only negative was unavailability to check in early. We understand it may not happen but why bother sending wyndham rewards members an email encouraging a 2pm early check in when clearly the likelihood is low.  We also thought the employee representing the rewards desk seemed uninterested and was literally on the phone while asking what we needed...not friendly.  Tried calling the hotel, but still no success. Saw others in lobby waiting with us gets calls for early check in before us.  At the end of day we had a room at 4pm, but maybe it should be made clear due to popularity that early Check in is not likely at this location. Also, this early check in piece;4
"Stayed a long weekend at Empire. Staff was great and location was perfect. Next to Lincoln Center and a stone's throw to Central Park and Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. Standard room was tiny, so upgrade if you have more than one person staying. Good pricing should allow for that. Rooftop bar had fantastic views and even though we over-indexed in age, the staff treated us like VIPs. (Tip: hotel guests don't have to wait in the long line to get in; just show doorman your room key.) Will definitely be back next trip to NY.";4
Newish, very clean and convenient. Great twin room with bathroom and fridge. But only one TV/meeting room in the whole 5fl house and being nonstop occupied by in-smoking southeast Europeans. Those people also tend to be drunk, noisy and on the verge of fight late at night couple of times. Also, kitchens have stoves, kettles and microwaves but no utensils/pots at all. Common bathrooms could use a deep cleaning. Cleaner never locked our door after cleaning. More of smile/welcome attitude from reception would be nice. Couldn't understand why guests had to pay in cash (nearly 400 pounds in my case) and not by a card. Despite all, I would stay there again.;4
"We used this hotel for our first trip to NYC for 3 nights. As stated in other reviews, you really cannot get a better location for a ""home base"" for NYC sightseeing. We were able to get to almost any place we wanted to see, via Subway or walking, rather quickly by starting from this hotel. It is an older, historic hotel & it shows but that is also the ambiance of it. Do not expect modern, luxury, futuristic decor/ammenities when staying at this hotel. Our room, a metro view standard room facing the Hudson, was small (we have had cruise cabins that were larger!), as well was the bathroom, but that is to be expected with this type/age of hotel. The room was very clean & quite, as was the bathroom. The bathroom also had nice, quality Bumble & Bumble ammenties stocked in it for our";4
Stayed in the Empire at the end of a 3 week honeymoon in USA. Staff at check-in very helpful and manager came out to greet us. We were given a room up upgrade. Room was lovely.  Close to Lincoln centre, Central Park and a short walk to Times Sq etc. Doormen were lovely and taxis readily available out front of hotel. Was disappointed not to get to  rooftop bar as it was closed each time we wanted to go. Enjoyed my 'Chuck Bass' cocktail in the lobby bar though!;4
The Empire is across from Lincoln Center. It is very convenient to many restaurants in the area. The rooms are comfortable. The staff is especially helpful. It is away from the theater district but within walking distance.;4
The location of the hotel is very convenient for travel around the city, close to the 66th street subway stop and Columbus Circle stop, so a matter of a few blocks from the 1,2,3, A, C & E lines, which was one of our reasons for choosing it.   The lobby is very nicely decorated and looks exactly like the photos. I can't comment on the bar service as we did not use it at any point during our week stay. There is also a rooftop club (again, did not use) and a pool/cabanas which appeared to be closed during our stay. It was a shame that we didn't use these amenities, I assume from the long lines for the club that it was good.   We were checked in by a gent called Pasqualie (apols if spellt incorrectly), who was very helpful, providing us with complimentary in room wifi for the;4
Hotel ideally located within walking distance to most attractions - about mid-way between Central Park and Times Square.  Staff were very welcoming and helpful.  Room was very clean however I found the air conditioning unit to be very noisy and would cut in and out depending on the room temperature which did disturb my sleep.  Wifi was available in the room but at a cost, (2 devices at $10 per day!), whereas it was free in the lobby which was not ideal for our 2 teenage girls.  The room also did not have complimentary tea/coffee facilities and the restaurant was closed when we returned from an evening out and therefore we was unable to have a tea before retiring for the night.;4
We stayed on the second floor.  You want to try to get higher . . . 5th floor maybe or higher.  The street noise can still be heard all through the night and early morning. Staff is very nice.  Great location.;4
I recently stayed at The Empire Hotel with one of my friends for a girls weekend in New York.  I won't lie primarily chose this hotel because of it's connection with Gossip Girl and I think that some of the other younger guests did too!  Upon arrival to the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised, after reading the reviews on here I did expect something else.  Yes, in the public areas the lighting was moody and the decor dark - but intentionally so.  It felt plush and luxurious. So far, so good.  We had a bit of a hiccup with the check in - the hotel had mixed our booking up and had us arriving on the day of our departure! We had the confirmation email with the correct dates, so after a few minutes it was all sorted out.  The guy sorting our check in was efficient, friendly and;4
Morningside was the best of the three budget hotels I visited on a recent trip. The room was clean, fairly large, and had a very comfortable bed.  It was also the only one with cable tv.  I stayed at hotel 31, and hotel 17 as well ... and morningside offered a much nicer room.  I had a private bath, so the only thing I can't rate is the shared bathroom.  The location is good for access to Harlem and Central Park ... and you can get a subway to anywhere else. I would definitely stay here again.;4
Overall very good experience and wondeful stay. Great access to LAX. Room is in good and clean condition. Valet parking is a little bit too pricey. Can expand the restaurant menu to cater more choices.;4
Great hotel, and location. Friendly and efficient staff from the coffee shop to the maid service, to the front desk!  Convenient shuttle to and from Universal Studios. Took the shuttle to the park, and walked back, which was fine if you want a little more exercise. There is a pedestrian bridge to get you over the main drag.    If you're tired of Starbucks and want to try a California brew in the morning, they have a Peet's Coffee in the lobby. Sorry Starbucks, but when I have a choice it's Peet's.  After a long day in the park, stopped for a beer in the lobby bar. Nice selection including craft beers on tap, and wasn't crowded.    Room was clean, spacious, and had a view of the park and downtown Los Angeles.  My Hilton perks included complimentary breakfast in the morning if you;4
My family of four spent 2 nights here during a visit to Los Angeles.  The 18th floor, 2-queen room was great - clean and well appointed - with a great view.  I'd taken advantage of a $7 per night upgrade offer which was well worth the cost.  The hotel had all the services and amenities one could want, however, separate charges for internet access and self-parking seemed petty and excessive, even for LA.  Very close to Universal Studios and to US-101.  The staff was very friendly.;4
Very nice apartment, when I will  return to New York will stay here again. The apartment was within my budget, cheap compared to some of the similar accomadation in Manhattan. The staff were very friendly and the location was very good, residental and very friendly . Only a short subway ride away from times square and all the other must see attractions in New York yet not to close to all of the madness either. The rooms in the apartment were very nice, its really up to yourself how clean you keep them, however in our 2 weeks stay we did get it cleaned twice. All in all, a very nice experience, especially given the price.;4
Room was nice and spacey. AC was ok at best after a day at the park and the sun beating on the room a quality AC is essential had it set to 60 and still wasn't that cold. Bathrooms need an exhaust fan and with 4 people in a room another mirror for the women to get ready is a must have. Hotel has a great pool and in house bar/restaurant. City walk which is a five minute walk away has just about everything you could want in the way of food/drink and shopping.;4
Hotel was nice as hotels go. We had a spacious king room, big bathroom, comfy bed. The pillows were wonderful. The shower head on our bathroom shot out needles of water, so we had short, painful showers.  I'm not a HiltonHonors member so I missed out on some perks. One of which was free Wi-Fi. It wasn't a pain, but a lesson learned. It would have been nice to have the HH system explained and been asked to sign up. I probably would have.  The two concierge we dealt with were both very helpful and knowledgeable. The food was good...very expensive, but good. I'd stay again , if I signed up for HH.;4
Stayed at this hotel early May brilliant location and great service highly recommended ,only there few days but did a tour  'New York in a day ' couldn't believe how much we covered our guide Gill was funny and informative .pizzeria flamagios opposite for inexpensive fresh Italian food;4
Staff were all very helpful. Room was very clean. The interior of the hotel was nice. Liked the little extras like the Bumble and Bumble toiletries in the room. Great location. Right next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The area was very busy around the hotel so maybe not ideal for every visitor. We were a little cold one night and staff provided an extra blanket promptly.;4
The staff was excellent and friendly. The location perfect. The one major gripe is charging guests for wifi. I realize its free to anyone in the lobby and guests only on rooftop, however as a paying guest $400 plus a night I expect wifi in my room. If the idea is to get me out of my room to the lobby to use it so that I spend, I am not happy. If the concept is that you need my $12 thats sad. In this day an age, WifI is in all rooms, The Comfort Inn gives free wifi. Think about it. I, along with any stranger  wanders into your lobby have free wifi. Now here I am a paying guest and I can't use it in my room. Other than that your hotel is lovely. I checked in and was offered a smoking room if I wanted to ck in early, I took it (a non smoker) and it was just fine. No smell interior;4
We had very good time . Great location, amazing view , clean , reliable , professional and friendly  staff.Always trying to help.  Would definitely recommend!! Walking distance to restaurants .Beautiful view.;4
I couldn't really fault this hotel. The standard of accomodation was good, a nice marble lobby and good quality accomodation with 28 inch TV and nice clean bathroom. Continental breakfast was included and the selection was quite good with Donuts, Toast, Coffee, Fruit Juices plenty to set you up for a day's sightseeing. I didn't hire a car so Transportation wise it was a short walk to the Metro Station which takes you to the heart of Hollywood Boulevard and Universal Studios also an easy walk to the main roads for catching busses. At the end of the day if you want to pay double (at least) to stay in Beverly Hills then fair enough, but if like me your on a budget then this would be an excellent choice.;4
We stayed here for 5 nights and were really happy with the hotel. The room on the first night was far too small (1020) the bathroom was tiny and the bed took up almost all the space however on ringing reception they were really helpful and upgraded us to a bigger room for the rest of our stay. Clean rooms and v comfy beds. Jeff in the lobby was really helpful with getting taxis and looking after our bags while waiting for our transfer. 10 min walk from Times Square and close to lots of bars etc.  The only problem was no drink making facilities in the room. Tea and coffee available in the lobby in the mornings along with a limited breakfast for $12. With so many diners close by we never ate there. Good hotel can highly recommend;4
I posted a negative review after a very dismal stay, where neighboring guests kept me and my daughter up with excessive noise throughout the night, with very little support/action from the hotel employees.  After being contacted by the hotel's marketing person, I was promised a follow-up from a manager.  Well, six weeks later, I still had not received a call or any communication from the manager.  I was just going to let it go and chalk it up to getting lost/ignored in the giant corporate world of Hilton, but decided to send another email to the original marketing person who had contacted me, expressing my disappointment in the lack of promised follow-up.  Hours later, I received a call from the hotel manager, Cornelius, apologizing for the delay.  After listening to his;4
We stayed here in the summer at the end of a road trip. Great location- walk to C.Park & near subway. The roof terrace is uber trendy and becomes some sort of club at night. Everything in the room is extra so no water or tea/coffee making facilities unless you want to bankrupt yourself! The room was small but comfy and clean. Staff here are lovely. I was helped to retrieve my kindle which I had left at Atlanta and the staff there were useless. Minerva let me use her phone and then took over to help me, we also had a late checkout so we could enjoy our last day in NYC and get a showers before flying back to UK. Would def stay again.;4
The staff were helpful and friendly, the doormen in particular, they would suggest places to visit and how to get there, and would chat with you every day. The hotel was clean, the dÃ©cor was a bit dark feeling a bit dingy. Hotel room was clean and kept clean every day, the bathroom was extremely small but ok. The double beds were very small (not sure if they were double). I felt the hotel was a bit out of the way. Most attractions mid town to Down town, one good thing was it was very close to Central Park, will probably stay midtown when I return as I usually do.;4
Very good location. I traveled solo and it was like in the middle of EVERYTHING. the subway is just a block away (Penn Station). Super busy hotel, but, all the staff was super helpful and efficient in all ways.;4
The staff are very friendly, especially Linda, she greets you with her smile and goes above and beyond to help you out! The lobby is huge and the atmosphere at the hotel makes you feel comfortable because there are always people checking in and out of the hotel. The building is historical and the location is close to everything.;4
Spent a night here with my boyfriend on the way home.  The place looks really cool inside, like an old cruise boat and everything was clean.  Shared bathroom was close by and also clean.  Our room was really really tiny, but there was everything we needed and the staff was really nice.  Boyfriend is 6ft tall and he had no trouble sleeping in the bunk bed.  There were water bottles in the room, which was a nice touch.  Only bad things were that the heater was heating A LOT (might be that we just didn't know how to operate the thing) and that the hotel isn't really close to the metro or the sights.  As an experience or for people who don't plan on being in the room a lot, I'd recommend any time.  I really liked the place.;4
What makes this hotel is the service!  We ate in the hotel at the Chowder House, very good food and service.  The only disappointment was the bathroom, very small and shower not functioning. Thanksgiving Day we had scheduled a car service that never picked us up, so Chris, at the concierge desk, got us a car that picked us up within a half hour and out to Long Island, on time.  Nice experience.;4
"Great location..... and a very beautiful lobby and bar area in the Manhattan tradition.  You definitely feel like you're experiencing New York! Our superior king room had a view of Lincoln Center and we were within quick walking distance to  all amenities, numerous restaurants, sites and conveniences.  Easy to get to, friendly staff.   The mattress  was firm which was great for my back. Room was small but to NYC standards.  Great price.  The only downside was a funky shower which let water splash onto the floor.  Also the room was a bit warm at night despite turning on the AC.   Overall we had a great experience and would definitely return. Definitely would recommend for a sightseer and someone wanting to ""taste Manhattan"".";4
This Hotel is well located near Times Square, Broadway/Theater district and Central Park. The rooms are decent sized, beds are comfy and bathroom is huge and nice. All staff was friendly but no housekeeping due to Covid/lack of personnel unless over 3 nights stay.  Also, there is no breakfast/food/bar available but plenty of options around.  Would stay here again.;4
Pros:  well priced, friendly staff, right off the park.  Clean room.  Cool area with good and diverse food choices.  Love being in a neighborhood.    Cons: some road noise, nothing fancy, best for one person;4
I had a good experience at the Hollywood hotel.  I had a rental car, but left it at the hotel and just took the metro - very convenient.  Hotel/room was very clean and modern.  The hotel was near my brother and when I come back for another visit, I'll stay here again.  Good breakfast too.;4
This was my second time staying at this hotel. The staff was always friendly as well as helpful. The price and location was great, close to subways and Times Square, but not too close!! Will definitely recommend to friends and family.;4
As always this hotel has a lot of activity in the lobby because of its location.  Our room was fine, on a high floor and away from the construction on the lower floors.  Our traveling companions did not have it as fortunate and they had noise, odors and too much activity for their liking.  The hotel tried very hard to help out but due to the capacity issues they could not do much.  Breakfast buffet was wonderful.;4
Very convenient location. We were on 12th floor, bed was amazingly comfy.  Very convenient location for Universal Studios and lots of great restaurants within walking distance.   Downside was the lifts, they took forever and at times just stopped. We used the stairs quite often during our stay, yes from the 12th floor as it was quicker.;4
Room was very clean, very quiet. We stayed on the 5th floor in a small, corner room with a single Queen bed. Paid $90/night, and was very happy. Service was excellent, both housekeeping and desk clerks. The only thing that kept this place from getting a perfect review was the lack of in-room internet access, the low-quality TV offerings, and the small, hot, and slow elevators. Minor stuff when compared with the value & quality of the lodgings themselves!;4
This a very nice hotel.  It has old charm.  Our plan came with free breakfast and internet.  The breakfast was more than we expected.  Made to order omelettes made for a hearty breakfast.  They have a nice bar but it must have been the off season because it did not open when we were there in Feb.  The room was not large but big enough for two people.  I believe the parking was not free but since we did not have a car I am not 100% sure.  The metro station was about 2 blocks away.  Easy excess to Hollywood and Universal Studio.;4
We stayed here for 5 nights for my birthday. We had a really nice clean room on the 32nd floor although traffic noise was still an issue. I guess thatâs what you have to expect from a noisy city like NYC. We had a view of Maddison Square Gdns and beyond. Toiletries were provided and a hairdryer. We didnât turn on the tv but it was well positioned. The hotel put a bottle of sparkling wine in the room with a card wishing me a happy birthday. We found the location to be excellent as nearly everywhere was within walking distance or a short ride on the subway.;4
Beautiful hotel and although the bedroom is quite compact, itâs clean, modern/traditional and the bed is incredibly comfortable and the bathroom has a shower over the bath, everything needed and the view we had looking directly at the Empire State Building was worth itâs weight in gold! I slept with the curtains open, watched the sun rise in the morning, absolutely breathtaking.;4
Excellent accommodations and service. I am a New Yorker and staying at this hotel was both convenient and comfortable. The service was as expected. I stayed on the 20th floor and my room had 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms! Perfect. The Tick Tock restaurant was the best for a quickie snack and to chat with old friends.;4
Stayed at the hostel as a friend and I were attending a concert at the nearby eventim Apollo and wanted something that wasnât Â£150+ (as essentially everything in London on a Saturday night is) - for the price it really wasnât bad. The room was a decent size, our only issue is that we had a requested a room with two single beds (and this was on our booking confirmation) but we were given a double bed instead, however this wasnât enough of an issue to complain as we didnât mind too much. The shower room was much nicer than expected and very clean. We didnât make use of the kitchen facilities but they also looked clean. The staff were very nice and helpful during our stay and we never had any issues in that regard, however be aware that if you want to split the bill between two of;4
The Wyndham is very well located close to Penn Station and right next to 34th Street subway . getting around New York from the hotel is very easy , just a few blocks away from Times Square , 42nd street and Broadway . The subway is very easy to negotiate  and very reasonably priced ($2.75 for a senior citizen) . Travelling by  taxi is  very expensive and frustrating , traffic is often grid locked and pedestrians ignore traffic signals which adds to the general chaos . The subway is the way to go. We arrived at the Wyndham late at night after an eleven hour train journey from Niagara Falls we were tired and looking forward to bed . We were greeted by a lovely young lady called Chrystal who immediately put us at ease and was most welcoming . when she learned we were celebrating;4
From check in to check out everything was smooth. The beds were comfy and the room clean! The Bell staff was great in storing our baggage for both early and for late checkout and very prompt when we checked in getting them to our room.;4
We stayed here 8 days. At first we got a room on the bottom floor. It was a bit dark and cold. The tiles on the floor made it colder. We changed the room for one on the third floor. Much better! It was bigger and even had a balcony. The only negative thing was that the wifi connection was much worse in this room.  The hotel has a very small gym. Four cross trainer machines and a few weights. But it's ok. The breakfast is average. But Hugo and company that makes the omelettes are excellent!! Very tasty!;4
The hotel is in a useful position, close to the Central Park . Room spacious , clean and well equipped. Thanks for hosting our pet, It's a pity that it was not possible have dinner with  the pet in your restaurant.  Special thanks to Mr Pasquale for the courtesy and the helpfullness.;4
Nice rooms, good views, right next to universal city, helpful concierge, free gym. Had a very pleasant experience overall and wouldn't mind staying there again.;4
Have fond memories great hospitable people we had a good time . As soon as we checked in were surprised with the room with a view and complimentary welcome note from the chairman along with basket and invitation to chairmanâs lounge for cocktails . Met with some fine people and our family felt like home . Possibly one of the best Hiltonâs we e stayed with in terms of care and service . The property is only 8 mins walk from universal studios and a Shuttle service all day long .;4
I crashed here for a few days while my daughter recovered from surgery. Let me start off by saying HH is clean. Really clean. The floors in the rooms are mopped daily, and my room sparkled after every housekeeping stop. I felt safe: you must have a room key card or be buzzed in the main entrance, and the elevator has its own âsecret handshakeâ to get to your floor. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. The rooms are a bit shabby: furniture dented, walls and doors with chipped paint, and my bathroom door did not close completely, but Iâm coming back to clean because thatâs the most important thing to me. Good place to stay for a couple of days, but I donât know that I would base myself there as a tourist. The neighborhood is a tad iffy, a hospital district, so you donât;4
"I stayed at The Jane for 7 nights in October. From reading up about the hotel before I booked I already knew that it was something of a hotspot for the local hipster crowd, with its cool bar/club and retro style. Right enough, the Friday night I arrived (late check-in at 10.30pm) there was a long queue of kids outside with taxis coming & going every few seconds. Checking in, the concierge & I almost had to shout to hear each other - the club is just around the corner from the check-in desk. I was quite taken aback and asked the concierge jokingly if this was the hip spot to be on a Friday evening in Greenwich Village. He said ""Yeah, and Saturday, and Sunday and Monday...it's like this every night!"". Thankfully, it wasn't. Even on the Saturday it was way quieter... think it was";4
Small, clean, nicely appointed room with all the amenities- coffee, hairdryer, etc. The two big pluses were A. The international television channels- who knew French TV was good? and B. The beautiful courtyard ajoining our room.  An additional point given for the hotel being dog friendly.  Location is perfect for locals such as ourselves. It is a mixed, diverse neighborhood, so if you are looking for a 1960's TV set California, this isn't it. But the location ( just off the 101), proximity to attractions and cheap eats can't be beat. No, it is not on the beach. But the beach is just a short  Uber drive away, and this place is easily $100 cheaper per night. Nice pool, helpful staff,  safe, onsite parking, frig in room for all those yummy leftovers.;4
We arrived in a panic after an incident at another hotel and everything was handled very well. My only complaint about the service would be that the front desk staff stopped being nice to us as we were checking out, they loose patience and try to get rid of you. Our room was TINY, so small that we barely fit our bags and had to maneuver around them just to get to the bed and the bathroom. Room was clean and pretty, lobby very nice and the location amazing if you want to stay in the middle of everything.;4
Can't beat location.  As in prior reviews, we have to say the Empire is a bit tired, but it's clean and comfortable and the location cannot be beat if you are going to a performance at Lincoln Center.  The people are excellent from the guys out front to the desk inside.  Elevators can be a bit slow and crowded but I think that's just goes with the older building.;4
"Hi, just got back from 4 nights there last night. It was a ""sun"" trip, and the cornerstone of it was visiting Universal Studios.  The hotel was quite nice - very much Marriott/Hilton level, There are some little niggles with a few things, nothing major that would cause a bad day, just minor things (hot tub closed one day, shower really leaked into bathroom floor, gift shop prices on soda insane, minor things).  I do want to recommend it for being a great place if you are visiting Universal. There is a free shuttle down and back (runs about every 15 minutes - also visits the Sheraton). You could walk it, too, if you felt like it. I also walked down the hill to the Red Line subway station, as well. Perfectly situated for this.  The staff was SUPER friendly, and always very";4
Just stayed for 3 nights on our tour of the U.S., fantastic hotel with the nicest staff we met on this trip. Universal studios only short walk from hotel. Family friendly with a pool. Would have given 5 stars but food very expensive. Overall excellent hotel with terrific staff.;4
Located in Mid town. perfect for MSG, Penn Station, Empire State, Macy's etc. An art deco hotel that is looking shabby in places. Check in friendly and efficient, room tiny but clean and comfortable. Very very busy whilst we were there but staff coped well and were always charming. Stayed for five nights and perfectly suited our needs, bed comfy and shower one of best I've ever used.  Down side, the 29 dollar per night facilities fee is a rip off, no coffee maker in room. Room needed a makeover, traffic noise even on 24th floor can keep you awake.;4
I stayed here for a Coldwell Banker National Convention last week because the entire conference was at Universal Studios City Walk. They have shuttle service every 5 minutes to the center of CityWalk or Universal Studios which was really convenient. Even though the hotel is a bit dated, they are renovating room by room and just finished the lobby. The Seafood buffet is terrific for $49 serving Lobster Thermador among other exciting  dishes. My room overlooked the Hollywood Fwy but it was not loud, offered a nice view and the room was very large. I would stay there again if I was doing anything in the Valley or Hollywood. It is just a short drive over the hill on highland into Hollywood. Thumbs up for staff and service.;4
Rooms were smaller than expected.  Not anything like was pictured on the website.  Hotel was clean, staff was great.  Location is awesome.  Food was good.  I would  stay here again.  Just don't expect to stay in a room like is pictured on the website.;4
Bit of a pain to get to waiting for a bus for 10-15 mins  (and not great sign postingâ¦ 1st floor and to your right coming out of the international terminal!). Check in/ out easy enough and room was modern/ comfortable. Vending machine and ice on our floor (10th). Restaurant had a decent atmosphere but food was a bit stale. 24/7 market if you arrive outside of typical hours and need a bite to eat. Shuttle bus back to the airport was every 20 mins (we left at 8pm). Ok if youâve got a late/ early flight. If you connect with them directly, you can book a room for a few hours instead of paying the over night price.;4
We recently stayed at The Empire Hoel for 1 week. We had no prior experience of NYC. The foyer area is charming - old world decor - check in staff were friendly and helpful.  The location is superb - close to Central Park and across the road from the Lincoln Centre Subway making it very easy to travel downtown and visit many of the iconic NY attractions.  Columbus Circle shops are a short walk away (with a Whole Foods supermarket and Amazon book shop) and if you enjoy walking it's an easy walk back from Times Square to the Hotel. There were some minor irritants wth the room (too warm and not particularly comfy pillows) and the street noise but hey, it's on Broadway so this is to be expected and is outweighed by the positives. A couple of great eating places across the road:;4
From when we first arrived the staff greeted us courteously and were very welcoming. Both concierge and reception were helpful and friendly.  The location was perfect. I would recommend this hotel.  The room (916) was a bit tired, back of bathroom door peeling, aircon unit very noisy, bed head rests worn. However the room was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  I would recommend the hotel to others.;4
Love this hotel and the location. Been coming got years. Rooms need a spruce up. Staff is great fitness center is great. Hotel location to everything on upper west side subway 2 blocks away. Would recommend to any one looking for a stay in the city;4
This hotel is in a great location only 2 blocks from Columbus circle, one block from Central Park and a few blocks to Time Square. Staff were always pretty helpful. Lobby is very aesthetically impressive although there wasn't an awful lot of atmosphere in the bar and drinks in the Moore restaurant were very expensive. The room we had was lovely and spacious. All the essentials plus a hair dryer, safe and good TV. Bed was comfy and whole room was spotless. The 2 problems we did have was the seal on the bottom of the shower was broken so we ended up with a flooded bathroom after a shower (which did dry up after a few hours and towels were always replaced while we were out) and that it was very noisy - not sure if the air con unit was outside our room but even with the windows;4
I loved my stay at the Jane. I loved the trendy location, away from the more touristy areas. It's about a 10 minute walk from the subway.  The rooms are tiny, but I knew that when I booked. The shared bathrooms were always clean and I never had to wait. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the bar downstairs was a nice place to enjoy a drink after a long day of exploring. My only two complaints are that I stayed in March and I couldn't control the heat in my room - it was way too hot, but I was able to open the window which helped a little. And there was a really gross smell near the fourth floor elevator. Overall, I loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again. It's perfect for solo female travellers as I always felt safe walking around in this neighbourhood.;4
"Spent a Sunday night on Dec13, 2015. Rates were less than half the price of Saturday a day earlier! So, if at all possible, stay Sunday nights. Staff was great - every single person!  Room was a ""Metro View"" double, that afforded us an incredible view of the Empire State Bldng, and the Chrysler & Met Life Bldngs as well. The room was small, but neat and had a safe in the closet. No refrigerator though. The white bath towels were clean, but shed like crazy when they were used to dry off! Had to ""dust"" each other off afterwards to remove all the white lint! I had a ""confirmation"" for Metro View, which, as the name implies, gives you a view of the NYC Skyling in Empire State direction, not Hudson River. Upon arrival I was told that was not available, only Hudson view. I contested";4
We stayed here for too nights. Located in Hollywood but you have to have a car to get around. But that's LA. Room was big and nice but they are billing everything, even if you park your own car. Expencive breakfast also. A bit tired staff sometimes but not always. Ok hotel visiting Hollywood.;4
My twin sister and I stayed in The New Yorker last weekend and loved every minute . We were celebrating our 30th Birthday and when we checked in, the hotel manager gave us a nice upgrade to the 30th floor, and had a bottle on wine sent up to the room. She was really friendly and couldn't do enough for us.  Our room was small, but it was perfect for what we needed. Lovely view of the Hudson. The bathroom was nice and modern, had a walk in shower ( no bath). We had a coffee machine, water in our room on arrival. The bed was super comfortable and didn't hear any noise from outside. The room got cold, but the heating was great and warmed up very quickly .  We ate in both restaurants ( tick tock diner and Trattoria Bianca). Tick tock was lovely, we had lunch here, service was a;4
This friendly hotel is very conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan. Just 200 metres or so from the nearest subway at 34th Street/Penn Station, so handy for the A, C & E lines uptown or downtown and also for the journey right out to the Airtrain to JFK Airport. The room was clean and the ensuite bathroom was fine. The only negatives were a lack of storage place for clothes as there were very few drawers and a rather inconsistent wifi signal. The staff were very helpful, including informing us of the Airport Shuttle service and so saving us money rather than booking a taxi. The local area is full of bars, delis/markets and places to eat. In particular, there is one of the best pizza places in the whole of New York just 50 metres around the corner on 8th Avenue. Make every;4
Good hotel but  long way to restaurangs. Near to undergroundstation. Very helpful staf Nice breakfast, big rooms, but a litle noice there is a Hospital in the area so the ambulans are offen coming om the big street.;4
The hotel room wasnât as I expected. The bed had rips in it and I was not totally happy. However we spent little time there. The mini bar was extremely expensive and I wouldnât use it!  Jeff the door man is outstanding the lobby area is well decorated.  Location is amazing! Would I go back? Yes I would!;4
I booked this hotel at the last minute and as it was only a short break this seemed ideal.  Check in was quick and helpful.  Hotel is like Art Deco style.  Staff are really friendly. Lifts are quick Great location We had two double rooms which were ok in size. Beds are comfortable Clean rooms Rooms aren't very soundproof The only way I can describe this hotel is ' it's like a piece of antique furniture, it's not sparkly and perfect, it has chips and dents in it but that just adds to the charm'  I have stayed in a lot of lovely hotels.  And they seem a lot nicer but this hotel has a lot more to offer than them. Don't expect perfection but it has definitely made up for it in other ways. Cons: Needs a mirror in the room for ladies  dressing or a shelf in bathroom to put things on.;4
This was my first time in LA and I am glad I picked this hotel.  The hotel is best known for the staff as they are the ones that made my trip so pleasant.  Front desk was easy to talk to and ask questions to. Everyone was always so helpful and offered great customer service.  They had my best interest in mind all of the time. A quick mention to Cynthia who was always so sweet and kind, thank you. :)  The room was spacious and clean.  The bathroom counter was extremely small but I made do.  I was on the 3rd floor.  Great view from the patio and very quiet. Fridge and  microwave in the room. The vending machines needed more attention and was never fully stocked.   The breakfast was phenomenal. Hugo, Elvira, and Sonia make the best omlettes. Their infectious smile was worth going;4
"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this property.  Staff are very helpful and friendly, the hotel is very clean and tidy.  Our room was modern, lovely comfortable bed, great view out across the city and an attractive, spacious bathroom with excellent lighting.  We had breakfast buffet several times at the hotel's restaurant, Cafe Sierra, which I couldn't fault.  A wide selection of very fresh food; American, Asian and Continental. Universal Studios itself is a short and pleasant walk (uphill) around the side of the hotel.  There is a shuttle from the hotel that we didn't use as we enjoyed the walk. Pets are allowed which is a bonus for owners. I would definitely stay there again without any hesitation. The only negative is the smokers area is immediately to the right as you come";4
We stayed here for three nights while visiting LA. It was in a good location as a base for sightseeing in the area. The immediate area seemed a little sketchy. You need o gave a car as there is no restaurants within walking distance.   The room was nicely appointed and clean. The bathroom had peeling walls and rust spots on the ceiling and there was very little water pressure. The bed and pillows were comfortable.   The staff in the evening was not very helpful but the morning desk clerks gave us a map of the area, printed directions for us and gave us great recommendation. Parking is $26 There is parking on the street next to the hotel but check the signs.  The breakfast included in the room price was great. There is cook to order omelettes and waffles, as well potatoes,;4
This was a great place to stay, it was a special trip and they gave us an upgraded room and champagne to celebrate. The hotel is great for access to the park and subway and bus stops to go downtown are on the corner. All the hotel staff were very friendly and professional;4
The Hollywood Hotel is located within walking distance of the Hollywood walk of fame and also has two metro stations close by.  The reception area was clean, tidy and comfortable. Although checking in took some time, the staff were very friendly, professional and polite.   My room was a decent size with a double bed, air conditioning, coffee machine, flat screen TV, microwave, ironing board and free wifi. Everything you could have needed.  The ensuite bathroom was an ok, but maybe could have done with a bit of an update  Breakfast was excellent. There was a huge buffet as well as freshly made omelettes and waffles. The breakfast staff were all very friendly and happy to help.   However there are a couple of let downs. First of all, there is no restaurant and the bar doesn't;4
After reading the reviews of this hotel, we were very worried about this hotel and even had a back up plan in place.   However.....Our 5 night stay did not disappoint. We arrived early and left our bag at the hotel with no worries and was directed downstairs to the free coffee/tea/hot chocolate facilities.  No issues with check in.  When we arrived at our room we was pleasantly surprised with the modern decor and cleanliness, but was disappointed we didnât have a Central Park view but youâre in New York, you donât plan to stay in the room to look our the window, so wasnât an issue. We even had a working fridge in our room.  All staff we came across were friendly and polite.  Location was good only a couple of blocks from the Subway and didnât experience any road noise, only the;4
"The Empire Hotel is perfectly situated if you are in New York to visit Lincoln Center, as we were.  It is literally right across the street.  In bad weather, all dressed up for the opera, this can be an enormous convenience (worth paying for).  The lobby is quite grand and the service is magnificent.  The staff certainly know their business.  Our room, however, was tiny and poorly designed.  This is to be expected in an older New York property, but for the price a renovation might have been in order.  The rooms certainly do not match the grandeur of the lobby.  They might even be called ""shabby"" -- though not dirty or unpleasant.  Finally, in the year 2016 I cannot give an ""excellent"" rating to any expensive hotel that charges for internet access.  In an era in which cheap";4
Plan on paying  $28-40 per DAY to park, confidential breakfast starts at  $18 per person family of four that's  $100 just for a simple breakfast. So if you plan to stay bring lots of money because it's definitely not cheap!;4
The pictures on here show a bright lobby, it is actually quite dark. However, that being said, the room we had was fine. It was quite compact but enough room to hang our clothes and not trip over the suitcase.  As others have said, the room is noisy, in so much as they provide you ear plugs! Watch out for the wifi...it is $12.95 a day and when you pay ours didn't connect so we had to call wifi support each time.  Location was great, taxi rank outside, underground round the corner, 24 hour pharmacy downstairs selling bottled water, drinks and snacks as well as everything else you'd expect in a pharmacy. Starbucks is downstairs, we went there for breakfast.   I believe the rooftop bar is good, according to a local, but we didn't get chance to visit it, as we were meeting others;4
Stayed here for the Rose Bowl in January 2017. The hotel was nice, clean and the lobby was under renovation, but that didn't hinder the experience. Didn't get to use the pool as it was cold during the 1st week of January, so didn't even see it. There is no indoor pool on site. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We had room 466 which has a view of trees and the back of the hotel, kind of crappy. The beds were comfy and there were plenty of pillows. The restaurants were a bit expensive for my taste, but the nice thing is they offer shuttle transportation to Universal City Walk where you can find a bunch of other restaurants. The shuttle runs back and forth every 10 minutes and is quite convenient. You can take this same shuttle to get to the theme park entrance which is right;4
Comfortable rooms with good beds and a generous bathroom with good counter space. Great common areas off lobby with good seating.  Parking is accessible and sufficient.  It is at the top of a huge hill, so walking out is not so easy (but it's California - everyone drives everywhere!). Near lots of restaurants and shopping and Universal City attractions.  Easy access to Downtown LA via RT #101 South, which is very close to hotel site.  Good restaurant in the hotel and service was fine.  The hotel is pet-friendly (but you can't leave pets in the room when you go out).;4
I contacted the hotel prior to arrival asking for a high floor room and a rollaway bed. We had the roll away bed but were given a room on the 2nd floor which looked out onto a brick wall. The room we had was so small that when the fold away bed was down you could not get into the bathroom or out of the main door, in fact you really could not move! I rang reception to request bigger room but unfortunately they were fully booked right up until our last night. We had a problem with mosquitos in our room. So much so I was bitten 20+ times in one night. Don't forget your repellent! The reception staff were very friendly and always willing to help. The  hotel was very clean. Had breakfast here on our first morning which was ok. Not quite sure it was worthy of $18 per person though.;4
Great stay in New York at the Empire Hotel. Amazing city with so much t see and do. Central park very close to the Empire so great place to spend time in. The Empire has a great roof terrace for only guests to use during the day and one anyone can use anytime;4
the hotel is located at Universal city, walking distance to city walk. Great room, high floor with park view! The staff was very friendly, welcome us at check in. Our room was ready, even though we arrived before noon. The early check in was great, specially after several hours in a overnight flight.  The hotel is walking distance to City Walk, where there are several places to eat, drink and have fun. Universal Studios Hollywood is located there, but I found it worse than the one at Orlando. LA is a city that you need car to go from a place to other, but if you don't have one (like us) the hotel has a metro stop nearby and city walk offer several entertainement.   We'd breakfast once at the restaurant - great buffet! And dine once in room.;4
Our room was a decent size for the two of us and was cleaned every day. We had some difficulties at check in so Mohammed helped us out and gave us a free room upgrade. It was in an excellent location which had Penn station over the road and the local subway stops on each side of the building. MSG was across the road too and we were within walking distance of Times Square, 30 Rock and the Empire State Building.   The staff were so friendly and welcoming. But by far the best thing about this hotel is the fact that Tik Tok (diner) is directly underneath! We would 100% stay here again and look forward to!;4
"If you ever have any business at Lincoln Center, you can't stay at a better location! The hotel lobby is chic and inviting. Pasquale, who checked us in, made us feel welcome and made sure we had the best queen room available for my daughter and me. The concierge (I didn't get his name) was wonderful and had great suggestions for finding a picnic for the concert in the park, and he made sure we could find our way there with a map and verbal directions. His suggestions turned out perfect and delicious. The room turned out to be small, but by NYC standards it was average; some people live in smaller spaces. Be careful, everything costs, from the bottled water to the coffee service. I put it all away. The continental breakfast wasn't anything better than you'd get at a motel 6, so";4
If you're in LA for a short trip and you want to do Universal Studios, this is the perfect stop. Comfortable and clean rooms, friendly staff, the trademark Hilton breakfast buffet (perfect for starting off the long touristy days). Not only does a free shuttle run every fifteen minutes to Universal, but the metro station is less than ten minutes away on foot and connects you to the center of all the fun places. The beach is at quite a distance from the hotel though, so unless you have a car, you'll need to keep track of the public transport system to return to the hotel (we missed the last bus on the weekend and got stranded for a while).  Hilton has never disappointed us and the streak just continues!;4
Was looking for a cheap hotel in a good location for a weekend trip to NYC. Travelled during Marathon Weekend so I found a great deal with the Jane Hotel.  Arrived at 10am and quickly checked into our bunkbed room.  The room was INSANELY tiny, but for two girls and our carry-on suitcases, it suited us just fine.  I would not try to bring in full sized suitcases, as I have NO idea where you would even open them as there is next to no room to do so.   I loved the fact that they have awesome free bottles of water, and the individual flat screen tvs on each bunk.   The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful and the bellman was SO adorable, always holding the door open for us and wishing us a great day.  We ate one breakfast in the cafe, it was yummy, but the service was;4
Very pleased with this stay. The biggest plus is the location - really central for everything. The room was very well maintained, clean and comfortable and the staff really pleasant and helpful.  Breakfast room was packed, but they handled this really well and the food didnât suffer from having to feed so many.;4
Great Location at Times Square. Very good standard room. Breakfast disappointing as was not hot despite buffet style. Complained to hotel and they sorted this. Rooms with safe and mini bar. That apart our stay at this hotel was very enjoyable and I would recommend this hotel to any of our friends. Janet and Geoffrey were very helpful and a credit to their roles at the hotel and their help was much appreciated.;4
My boyfriend and I came up to LA to celebrate our anniversary and visit Universal Studios. The hotel was lovely and very well appointed. There was a tiny bit of construction but not very noticeable as it didn't really effect our stay.   I wanted to specifically call out Linda our front desk agent. She was wonderful! Very knowledgable about the area and the experience. She was so upbeat and it was really a joy to meet her.   Overall I would definitely stay here again (also the breakfast buffet is SO GOOD);4
I stayed here from 1st - 6th September 2017 - and it was awesome! We were there for Labour day.   At the hotel we had a metro queen room, I think it was room 3114. The room was big enough for the 2 of us. The bed was quite big and super comfy. The air con worked perfectly and was pretty quiet. The bathroom was quite small, in that if you sat on the toilet you wouldn't be able to close the door! Also, the room had a wardrobe which had a safe, and was big enough for both cases + more! We had a view of Madison Square Garden, which was cool too - at night it was very quiet considering it was peak season.   The hotel has a diner 'attached' to it (Tick Tock Diner). We ate here the first evening (has a massive burger for cheap), and every morning we came here for breakfast - getting a;4
"My mom and I had a wonderful stay @ The Jane. We really enjoyed the quirky atmosphere of the hotel and had a great time at the bar and Cafe Gitane. We stayed in a bunk bed room with shared bath. The only down side to our stay was not being able to get ready or ""hang out"" in the room at the same time -- the room was too small. And, also, there was some ""weird"" stuff going on in the shared coed bathroom at one point -- an older gentleman seemingly making tuna fish? Hmmmm. Odd. The bathrooms were clean overall, but I definitely wish they had provided us with waterproof shower shoes rather than cotton slippers. The robes also could have been a bit bigger/longer since we had to walk thru the halls in them.  But, that being said, we really enjoyed The Jane and I would be inclined to";4
Though obviously far from Downtown and Hollywood, it is a nice place to stay. Excellent amenities and service. Smiling staff all the time and very helpful (especially at the Members Lounge on 3rd floor). Conveniently close to a HopOnHopOff bus stop, you can go easily in town and com back at 8PM. Bathrooms should have Int'l electric plug for razors. Good shuttle to LAX (10 minutes ride);4
"I avoided this hotel for years because I thought it was ""away from the action"" in terms of LA landmarks, attractions, and the better areas of town. Boy, was I mistaken! This was such a fantastic experience. You can actually walk from the airport (be careful for traffic if you do!) or take the shuttle for a short drive. The rooms are MASSIVE! Especially compared to rooms that are available in the city. Rooms are cleaned, and the staff is incredibly kind. I found myself enjoying the experience of this hotel vastly more than I thought I would. Highly recommended.";4
Stayed in the New Yorker in Feb 2013 and been to NYC since and realised what a little gem of a hotel it is   Basic rooms but enough for your needs when in NYC (if you spend too much time in your hotel you are doing NYC wrong)  Beautiful lobby area and great in house Dinner with Tick Tock being great place to start your day (Massive portions!!!)  Location couldn't be better right in the Centre of all of the action, quick walks to times square and the High Line, only time we got subway was going to financial district   Nipped back in when was staying in Dec 2016 and was nicely renovated from when I had prev stayed (made mistake of staying hotel Pen this time, I will be returning to New Yorker on my next visit);4
Located right across from The Metropolitan Opera, the Empire Hotel could not boast a better location.  When I arrived, Nick at the front desk upgraded me to a king room without my even asking.  He was very friendly and accommodating.  Similarly charming were the bartenders in the lobby lounge.  At $199.00 per night, it was a great value, too.  The fitness center, which is accessible 24 hours has recently been renovated.  Though not large, it is well equipped.  The bathroom is minuscule, a la Scandinavian style (I guess NYC real estate is very pricey these days).  One little surprise:  they charge $3.00 for each little coffee packet for the Keurig machine.  I've never seen this done before anywhere.  Of course, I'm used to seeing over-priced in-room amenities, such as liquor,;4
The staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were clean. only downside was the cockroaches we had on our fifth night, we told the person at the desk and they moved us rooms. the wait for the elevators was somtimes long, epecially on the fith floor as they were usually full by then but the 9th floor wasnt too bad.   it was good for the price would stay again.;4
Hollywood Hotel is a solid, modestly-priced option for a trip to LA.   It's located a mile or so from the heart of Hollywood, so be ready to drive or take public transit to get to the major tourist spots.   The rooms are spacious and clean, and there are a number of cool, funky restaurants nearby. The Vegan place at the corner of Vermont and Fountain (two blocks from the hotel) is excellent.   A highlight of the hotel is its breakfast: made to order omelettes/eggs and waffles, with sausage and yogurt, plus a nice selection of pastry and cereals.   Sonia and Oralia were cooking my first morning of my stay, and their warmth and friendliness made me feel very welcome.   One small request: it would be great if they could include half-and-half to add to the morning coffee (instead of;4
If you want to save a few buck, don't mind a very small room, enjoy the sights, tastes and sounds of West Greenwich Village, and just plain want something different and offbeat... this is your place.  My room was very very tiny. Complimentary bottle of water a small window (I could see the Hudson, just barely). Bed was okay, and everything was clean. The bathrooms were a little odd. They are unisex, and usually a woman or man would be in one. That took a little getting used to. I had a bathrobe they provide, so everybody is discreet, but it is a little odd coming out of the shower to find a gil in tights brushing her teeth :)  The hotel itself is amazing. Something out of The Royal Tenenbaums. The bar and ballroom are amazing, and the roof top is very cool. I was treated to a;4
I spent a week at the Empire Hotel on business in June 2012. The hotel was in a great location with easy access to Central Park and Columbus Circle with its great transport links.   The rooms are moderate size with all the amenities you would expect from a 4 star hotel in NYC. The gym is well equipped and room service is available for 24 hours with limited service in early mornings.   The staff were very accommodating during my stay, helping me print work articles and providing me with additional wifi access for multiple devices.;4
I kept seeing 3 stars so I was a little nervous, however the hotel was clean and very modern. It is definitely accommodating to those on a business trip but it was very convenient for my husband and I who planned a small get away. Staff was very friendly and helpful.;4
Stayed at the hotel for two days on business. Nice location around from the Lincoln Center. There were quite a few nice restaurant selections adjacent to the hotel area and a Starbucks right around the corner which were very convenient. Nice rooftop bar area with a view.;4
This hotel is a budget option at Manhattan, but the cleanest one I have experienced so far. No bugs in the bedroom, and the shower box was always dry and clean (I was probably the 1st user in the morning thou).  The hotel is a historical building, with two common (gender-less) bathrooms per floor. The standard room is rather small, not a good choice for claustrophobics or very large-frame people. The front-desk people were not the most helpful folks - your source of information here will be the doormen, who were polite and helpful. This hotel makes for an interesting stay, building-wise, and its location is very convenient: 5-10 minutes from A-C-E-L subway, safe neighborhood, a couple of blocks from the High Line, and across the street from the river front.;4
I stayed at the Empire Hotel for 10 nights during September 2016 in the corner suite. Suite was quite large with a living room that included a dining table, seating area and a TV. The bedroom was separated by french doors and also included a TV which was nice. Bathroom was clean and comfortable and I enjoyed the walk in shower which had strong water pressure (something hard to find in NYC). The furniture was dated but clean. Room view was amazing overlooking Lincoln Center on one side and Broadway street on the other. I can't comment on the regular rooms as I haven't seen them but understand they are very small so make sure you choose the right room.  The hotel has a nice and quite lobby which was important to me as I don't like going into a hotel with a tiny lobby. What I loved;4
We vacationed here in May 2017 Everyone was very friendly Room was nice would have liked a microwave The cops were staying on our floor which I could do without We were not told ahead of time if I knew would have picked another floor. Ate ate Cafe Sierra a few times ate at the buffet (dinner) $58 a person bought gift certificates ahead of time they took both which added up to 150 thought I would be credited the rest so we could eat breakfast the next morning no they didn't they took all of it rip off live and learn won't do that again I would rather stay at a smaller hotel;4
Having read the reviews that discuss how nice the remodel was, I was looking forward to our one night stay at this Hyatt Regency. We arrived at 3:00 to check in and the process was fairly smooth. We asked if there were any upgrades that were available, and we were moved to a higher floor. We weren't told why this was an upgrade, but it didn't seem like much of a gesture on the part of the hotel. In addition, we found the decor both in our room and outside, to be a bit too austere and dark. The nicest and warmest person we encountered our time at the hotel was a woman who worked the Concierge desk who was super helpful when we asked her questions about a nearby dining option. Otherwise, the overall atmosphere was like a huge machine that just cranked guests in and out. I wonder;4
We stayed there for five nights. We had an executive room on a higher floor, overlooking the City Walk. The room was spacious, clean and the view was amazing. Staff was friendly and helpful. Shuttle bus was very convenient.   Drawbacks were: (1) No free internet, which all guests complained about but still the management won't listen. Instead, they copy and paste some blah blah reply to people's complaints. (2) Elevators are a nightmare. We once had to wait for 15 minutes, called the front desk, and when the elevator finally arrived, it kept stopping on each and every floor, until it was crammed and we could hardly breathe. A sorry excuse for an elevator. (3) The bathroom could really use some renovation. (4) Parking fees are exceptionally high, higher than the car rent itself.;4
Amidst the pandemic, I needed a hotel to stay until I could return home. This hotel was well poised w.r.t. location so I booked it. The hotel amenities and COVID protocols were very good, I could see persons cleaning in the lobby all the time, mandatory temperature checks and hand sanitizer on every floor. However, when when I had questions about reservations Neida was the person. She made me feel very comfortable when I had question about literally anything. She always had the time to discuss any issues I had and always a person to her word.  Meeting a person like here during this unusual time we are in was very welcoming.  I would highly recommend this hotel, great location and staff.;4
Very pretty courtyard view from the  room. Room was super nice and comfortable. Nice pool area and. breakfast  included. Me and my daughter were taking care of business in Hollywood and studio city, so the location is ideal for us.;4
Was pleasantly surprised with this Hotel. Check in was a great experience, fast and made us feel very welcome. Good location near Penn Station and many NYC Trains. Madison Square Garden close by. Many restaurants and bars near by. I would stay here again. The only complaint is they are following the Time Square Hotels by charging a so called BS Resort Fee. It is far from a resort.;4
This wonderful Art Deco hotel is in a fabulous location right near Penn station/ Maddison Square Garden. It has everything around it you need.  The staff on check in were extremely friendly and wanted to make sure we were happy with our room selection.  We stayed 10 nights and requested a room as high as possible. We were put on the 31st floor in a big, clean room with 2 queen beds, and Importantly, a view of the Empire State Building. It was breathtaking looking out at the view, particularly at night.  The hotel had everything you need including restaurants, a well equipped gym, business centre, mail centre and an extremely helpful concierge. I had nail delivered whilst in New York and this was facilitated seamlessly by hotel staff.  We did not have coffee and tea making;4
We loved this hotel. The location is great for tourists because is near to everything you want to see in NYC. You can walk to many places, such as Time Square, Empire State Building and the Madison Square Garden, and you can take the subway to everywhere else. Service was great since the moment we arrived.;4
I LOVE staying at the Empire Hotel...the location is great and the facilities are good.  However, moving the fitness center 2-3 levels below the first floor was NOT a good move.  I am extremely dissatisfied with this move!;4
This place has plenty of character. The room was tiny but that's almost part of the experience, and the i loved the lounge bar. Door staff were great but some desk staff could sometimes seem a little surly - it is NYC i suppose!;4
This was the first place my partner and I stayed when we both moved to the UK from Australia. We found it to be comfortable and to surpass our expectations of hostel accommodation. The only issue was the noise level was high at night sometimes but through no fault of the hostel. The staff were very helpful and ensured we had a pleasant stay. Would definitely recommend to others.;4
The position of the hotel is really good, the staff is very kind, the hotel is clean and chic.. and finally.. a really dream the roof top! The concierge, especially Mr. Pasquale, helped us everyday also for transport and advices!;4
This is a clean hotel with friendly professional staff.  Yes, it is somewhat in need of updating but I was only there to sleep.  I needed a reasonable place to stay that was near Mt. Sinai hospital and this was my choice.  I wasn't there to vacation, I wasn't there to inspect the property, I was there to get a good nights sleep and I got that.  There is a laundry within walking distance and there are food establishments (open late) nearby.  If you have time to kill, take the bus up and down Broadway - there's plenty to do and see.  I would stay here again simply because the bed was comfortable, the staff was accommodating and I got a good nights sleep.  (PS: if the WiFi isn't working in your room, call the desk - they will relocate you to a room where the WiFi is stronger);4
We choose this hotel for it's location which was an easy walk to Universal Studios and City Walk.  It was a good choice for us because we didn't have a car.  The hotel staff was very friendly and our room was very nice..    Breakfast was included with our stay and unfortunately, that experience was not good.  We went down to their dining room which was about half full and was seated quickly.  We sat for awhile waiting for our waiter to come by but it didn't happen so we went over to the buffet and got our food.  Returning to our table, we continued waiting but still no waiter so I went up to the hostess about getting some coffee.  Eventually, after talking to the hostess twice more, the hostess served us coffee.  We never saw our waiter the entire meal (but the neighboring table;4
If you are planning to visit Universal Studios and Hollywood , this is the hotel you should  stay. Ideally located near the Universal Studios with free regular shuttle service and close to the metro station (10 minutes downhill walk/ shuttle from Studios) which will take you to Hollywood within 10-15 minutes.  We stayed here for 2N the week before Xmas and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Hotel was under renovation, without much inconvenience to the guests( at least for us). The service was impeccable and were welcomed warmly at the reception. We stayed in 2 QB room with swimming pool view. The proximity and shuttle helped to spend more time at Studios with ample time to relax.  The shuttle to studio will pick guests from Hilton and the hotel next door.  The negative side we felt;4
One night stay before a morning flight. It's obviously an airport hotel, nothing amazing but overall good. The lobby and entry were a bit noisy and crowded, but once we got to our room all was fine. Room service was adequate.;4
Just had four nights here, hotel is ideally located for a lot of the attractions.  Room was very nice, clean with very comfy beds and lovely crisp sheets.  Would have given it a five star review however I really missed making myself a cup of tea in my room so kettle etc would have been appreciated and there was a fridge in the room which was locked for some reason.  Special shout out and mention to Jeff the doorman who was so lovely and helpful, sorted us with a taxi for our return to the airport, nothing was too much trouble....the young man who collected us who was contracted to the hotel was an absolute delight and was so friendly and got us to JFK with time to spare despite the traffic being horrendous!  Can very much recommend this hotel.;4
Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of August and found the hotel to be fine. I love the location with many bars and shops within a 10 minute walk and the subway a 30 second walk.  Rooms smallish but fine, coffee maker and cable TV supplied.  Would stay here again.;4
This Hyatt Regency at Los Angeles International is very well maintained with all new amenities in what appears to be a recent upgrade. Very close to the terminals with a conveinient shuttle plus a shuttle to the cart rental hub.;4
The service at Riad Kheirredine is amazing!  Every person who works there seems intent on making sure you have the best time possible..,from making dinner reservations, to suggesting places to see and things to do, they were all fantastic.  The Riad itself is lovely with a terrace that overlooks all of the Medina where you can relax as you eat a breakfast spread that would be filling for even the hungriest of travelers.  Only complaint is the room itself wasn't quite as beautiful as the terrace and other common areas, but the room we stayed had just opened up so I'm sure they will correct this over time.  All in all a great place that we would stay again the next time.;4
Very good hotel, just needs tea/ coffee facilities in the room for first thing in the morning The hotel is in an excellent spot and the door man called Jeff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the city.;4
Afraid of mixed reviews I still took a chance . I was especially worried they would not hold the room as I was arriving late . Marlene at the desk reassured me when I called.   The room was clean, warm , and the little bathroom ample and cute. A lamp did not work but big deal    The area.. really nice . Good restos around the corner and even a subway.   For the price and area.. a great secret.;4
The double room was good size. The bathroom was roomy and comfortable and clean. The onsite food was good, but pricy - best to go to the city walk or door dash. Walkable to Universal studios and has a complimentary shuttle. Pool was well used and a bit dirty late in the afternoon - a bit unkempt for the price of the place. Parking is nearly $30 a day for self park.;4
"If you like a hotel with the look and feel of old New York and are drawn to places with a rich history then this is the hotel for you. The pros: Great location if you are attending an event at Madison Square Garden, lots of good dining options available within walking distance, the staff was friendly, room was clean and the bed comfortable, quick, easy check in. The cons: I had to pay a mandatory $30 ""facility fee"" to use services I had no use for. Don't know if this customary with all NYC hotels but it totally sucked. I had already overpaid for the room as it was... it's a little dated. The bath tub was old and it took forever for the hot water to kick in for my shower, I paid WAY too much for this hotel thanks to Hotels.com. I will never ever ever book with them again. Never.";4
We had a pleasant two-night stay at this property. We loved the relatively quiet upper west side location, only two long blocks from Central Park and two short blocks from Riverside Park. There are several good dining options within a one-block radius. Our room was clean, quiet and exactly what one would expect from a Days Inn. The price was right, and we were even upgraded to a corner room at no extra charge! The 1,2,3 line is almost outside the door, making travel to Times Square and downtown easy. We will stay here again if we travel to New York!;4
Great location for Universal and few exits away from Hollywood Blvd, Griffith Park, Hollywood Sign/Bowl view and TCL Chinese Theatre.  The elevators were a pain, but this is disclosed on their website.  Rooms are great and so was the staff.  In and Out burger is near by (yay!);4
We've stayed four nights, and it has been a pleasure.  Our room was very clean, the beds firm, pillows fresh. The ventilation was adjustable and worked perfectly. The little refrigerator kept our milk cold.  Had difficulty connecting to the WiFi, and Myra (dial 0, and she'll be there!) stuck with the problem, asking around until we could get my devices to connect. The hotel is a ten minute walk to the mall/cinema/theme park: mostly uphill. But I'm in okay shape, so no big deal.  But if you want to come back to the hotel to freshen up before dinner, walking back up to a mall restaurant seems really unappealing.  The hotel's restaurant didn't interest me, and I wouldn't recommend ANY of the theme park restaurants for dinner, so we ended up doing takeout from mall restaurants and;4
Location is great, and the lobby is pretty cool. Hallways are a bit dated, but as Wyndham Diamond I got upgraded to a suite with a private balcony that overlooks MSG.  Rooms had some wear but were clean, and itâs quiet. Give it a go, and you may be pleasantly surprised.;4
this location can't be beat. we took our 2 small kids (5 & 2) to the city for the first time and to our surprise, literally walked everywhere. the location was so good that we didn't have to use any other transportation besides our feet! we walked to pick-a-bagel a few blocks away for breakfasts, and we always had great lunch and dinner options within feet, in addition to shopping, a movie theater, central park, pharmacies, magnolia bakery, and more. it was perfect. we were warned it was loud but were pleasantly surprised- although on the 2nd floor, it was no louder than any other nyc location. our only complaints are 1) we wish we could have enjoyed the pool but it was closed for the season (and it was freezing so i don't blame them:) and 2) the bathroom was TEEEENY tiny.;4
Really enjoyed our stay at The New Yorker Hotel. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We were originally on the 24th floor and the room was nice, but when the staff realised we were celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary they upgraded us to the 31st floor to a bigger room with a great view, and gave us a bottle of champagne. The hotel is in a good location so planning our sight seeing trips was easy.  The rooms were clean, and the Tick Tock Diner downstairs was very convenient to eat. The only down comment would be the concierge staff were not as friendly. Would stay at this hotel again.;4
This hotel is in a perfect location - 1 min walk to the subway, 5 min walk to the Empire State Building and around a 15-20 min walk to Times Square.   The only bad thing I have to say is that the room we booked - the cheapest - was tiny so you struggle to fit 2 suitcases in and also don't shower with the door open as the steam sets off the smoke alarm!!   Other than that, an amazing pizza restaurant, Famiglia is just across the road.   Customer service from all staff was amazing. Guy on reception desk was lovely and so was the man who helped with our luggage. So all in all, a great time in this hotel!;4
Stayed here with my wife and two children for 4 nights over the Halloween break. Lovely hotel. Staff very courteous and professional, especially Mohammed at check in. The room was very comfortable and cleaned regularly. The only slight disappointment was there was no bath only a shower in the ensuite. The hotel is in a great location in midtown, nearby attractions include Times Square, Macy's, The Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens, The Vessel and the Highline. Had a nice dinner in the Tick Tock diner in the hotel.We will stay here again on our next trip !;4
Beautifully restored building, nostalgic atmosphere, tiny, cozy rooms resembling a train car or shipâs cabin.  Fun and different as well as affordable.  The mattress was too firm for my liking.  But they brought me an extra pillow a few minutes after I asked for it.  Bathrooms are shared which is not my favorite, but I knew that coming into it.  The one nearest my room appeared clean.  Lovely, antique marble sinks and tiled showers.  I would definitely recommend this for a budget stay or simply a different experience stay.;4
Just returned from a 4 night stay here. After reading some horror stories I was a bit scared to check in. However, it was fine and I neednât have worried. Yes, itâs dated and yes the rooms are tiny but we didnât care about those things. It was literally a place to get our heads down after a busy day. We were barely there and it did the job. The location was absolutely spot on. Right opposite madison square garden and a 10 min walk (if that) from Times Square. We couldnât have been more pleased with the location. Itâs also a 2 minute walk from somewhere that does THE NICEST bagel. Itâs called âbest bagel and coffeeâ. It was so nice we visited more than once. I was worrying about charges on check in as well but as we booked through virgin our tax and fees were included, phew! We;4
"As first time visitors to New York, the choice of accommodation is quite daunting. As is the best area to stay. We plumped for Mid-Town as it was central to all the sites. Our agent then recommended the New Yorker. In terms of location, its perfect. Really close to ESB, Broadway, Times Square, MSG et al. The hotel feels ""well used"" to the point of being a little tired in places. Our room (3432) was quite small and the bathroom was quite dirty (hair in the plug hole), however it was very comfortable and had good views. As this is New York, we weren't in the hotel that much so overall I would recommend the New Yorker. Breakfasts in the adjoining Tick Tock restaurant are fantastic.";4
This is a very good hotel in a fantastic location. Easy access to Penn Station and subway, Times Square is only a 10 minute walk. Plenty of dining options within easy walking distance.   Rooms themselves were tidy and reasonably appointed. Only (minor) complaint would be the shower head - it is like showering under a pressure hose with inconsistent temperature.   Aside from this an excellent stay.;4
Great overnight layover.  Arrived from London and swim in heated outdoor pool was nice end to long day.  Nice rooms, gracious staff, excellent location.  2 reasons for 4 instead of 5 star. Huge outdoor pool, but no hot tub? CA non-smokers rights were ignored, defacto smoking section right outside the door to the pool area.  Very disappointed that a hotel of this quality with visible security & staff clearly chooses to ignore the smokers who make it unpleasant for the majority of the guests who simply want to walk to pool without being assaulted by second hand smoke.;4
We stayed here the week before Thanksgiving for one night before going to Universal the next day.  The location was perfect if you are going to Universal.  We were able to walk to and from the hotel.  The rooms were very nice, actually nicer than I expected and the service was great too.  The breakfast buffet was overpriced so we asked around and got directions to the Good Neighbor Cafe a short drive away and saved a ton on breakfast.;4
I would highly recommend this hotel based on location. 10 minutes walk to the subway, opposite the Lincoln centre, endless amount of taxis outside.  Only a 4 out of 5 though based on the crazy cost of breakfast!;4
We enjoyed our stay room was clean and staff accommodating. Stones throw from MSG as we were there to see Billy Joel. Would use again if in the neighborhood. They also allowed us late check out which was convenient.;4
Location of hotel cannot be topped, near everything. rooftop bar was great. Stayed in a jr suite b/c we knew STD rooms were tiny. Our room was great. Called for an extra robe, service was a bit slow but cheerful. Would stay again.;4
After reading the reviews I was slightly dubious. Glad we stuck with it. Yes some rooms are slightly outdated (bust you can upgrade to recently renovated ones) yes room was slightly small. But we were never in the room other to sleep and change. Fab location very clean staff friendly and a brill location. New york was amazing !!!;4
We booked 2 rooms for a night at Halloween Horror Nights. Positives: location, location, location, rooms and bedding are very comfortable, awesome views of Universal Studios, provided interconnecting rooms with no request for this. Negatives: fridge in 1 room not working at all, 2nd room was not ready on arrival and reception promised to phone the 1st room when the other room was ready, this never happened and I had to do the chasing, maids started knocking on the door from 8.45am on check-out day, incorrect long distance phone call on the bill when we checked out and I really had to escalate to get this sorted out -  especially after the first front desk person said 'glitches like this happen all the all time'. I still felt like I was made out to be the criminal for trying to;4
Very late with this review  Family of 4  Children 14 & 8  Over all fantastic trip kids first time in NYC  saw all the sights walked and walked.  Hotel is in a fantastic location pen station across the road shops and bars restaurants on the doorstep.. couldn't recommend location enough Hotel itself is fine bit dated but clean we had a room on the 27th floor good view and elevators were always quick no problems there rooms are clean but used bed are comfortable and size was good(husband 6ft1) 2 queen bed kids shared one.. bathrooms not so good shower was either freezing or scalding to the point my 8yr old couldn't shower... came back one night and toilet had leaked maintenance came straight up we were offered to change rooms while they sorted it but said it would only take 30 mins;4
Clean hotel, room looked recently refurbished although the bathroom needed updated. Lovely central courtyard area. Bar was closed all the time we were here which management explained was due to a bereavement. Really close to the metro, red line service every 12 mins taking you to downtown la, Hollywood walk of fame and universal within 15 mins. Friendly staff and lovely breakfast. Only real negative was cost of parking (roughly $25 a day).  You can see the Hollywood sign from the stair window on the 3rd floor.;4
It continues to amaze me that The New Yorker, an aging hotel of days gone by of Nikola Tesla fame is still doing well in the city that doesn't sleep with so many other options for quality hotels. Well I can tell you that my recent stay was a very good one not being in the area for 2 plus years for a trade show. The location to many key sites is key. Only thing that was missed was complimentary water in the past at check-in. I would have given it 5 stars but the little things still mean the most!;4
Hotel is in good location. Staff very friendly.Rooftop is to die forBut rooms are smallBathrooms smallRooms not soundproofWifi very good. Very good reception, I will come back and stay at hotel..;4
the art deco lobby is beautiful and the location is very good- near MSG, Penn Station and  a short walk to Times Square where I had business meetings.  The rooms are small, the bathroom door doesn't even open all the way or it would hit the toilet. But the bed is great, the dresser/desk is nice and the closet is small but functional. FREE in-room wifi was nice. a lot of business hotels annoyingly nickel and dime you for this.  Not a place I'd stay for a week-long trip, but for a short business trip it was great.;4
My sister and I just got back from this hotel, stayed 14-19 Dec 04.  After reading the reviews on this website we were concerned we'd have to find alternative accommodation.  However we were more than happy. The room we had (923) was of a good size, comfortably had two double beds, and a small bathroom.  It was very clean, new sheets and matresses and the floor was hoovered daily when they also changed our sheets and towels.  Yes the furniture is old, but not falling apart and the shower was excellent, even if it did drain away a bit slowly. For what we paid (Â£450 inc Virgin flights from London for 5 nights) we were more than happy. Not having looked in any of the other rooms, I can't disagree with what other people have said, but did the bad reviewers stay in the same hotel as;4
4 of us had a double double room 2 weeks ago.  I wasn't expecting the room to be spacious as it is NY after all but it was not as boxroom as I anticipated.  To be honest, we didn't spend much time in the room so it wouldn't matter anyway.  The location is th best thing about this hotel.  It is minutes walking distance from most midtown sites and easy access for several subway lines, Penn station and the PATH to NJ.  The building itself has a cool history and tries to maintain the Art Deco vibe but is is a bit tired in places.  Overall I would go back for location and price was better then similarly located hotels.  Nothing about it was offensive, it just wasn't amazing.   However remember you are in NYC, you shouldn't spend much time in your room!;4
I had never been to NY before so it took me a while to decide on a hotel. I immediately liked the look of The Jane and loved the history behind it. I arrived at night and loved the look of it from the beginning.  I was quickly checked in with no problems. Ideally situated a few blocks from the subway and bus stops, the hotel was a short walk from The High Line, Chelsea Market and not far from The Meatpacking District. You can even walk out the hotel, cross the road and you are next to the Hudson River where you can follow it as far as Battery Park.  I booked a cabin room and although the rooms was small it was well designed, had a lot of storage and quirky decor and a very comfortabel bed. The bathroom and shower was shared but I never had to wait and they were always kept;4
The service I received at the Hotel was the best I've had in a long while at any hotel. The staff was so hospitable, helpful & courteous.  The food at Cafe Sierra was superb and the service was excellent. I would return to that hotel to stay.;4
Hotels in NYC are small and expensive but that's the price you pay to stay here. This was our second stay at the Wyndham New Yorker so we knew what we were getting. It's a large hotel and usually crowded. Lots of elevators so waiting wasn't an issue.   Room was spacious enough but as noted here, bathroom is small and old. Everything works and you don't spend a lot of time in the room so not an issue. Windows open to allow city air to come through but keeps out noise when closed.  Best aspect of the hotel is location. A block away from Penn Station, a few blocks from Mega bus and close to subways.;4
Happy for a few reasons.  The hotel far exceeds the ones I was finding in a similar price point.  Only a work trip, but wanted to be in an easily accessible part of the city and feel like I was in a hip space. I got a great rate too.    I didn't experience the issues I read about and have no complaints about my room-  it was quite large with a separate seating area from the beds (room 312).  Very nice if you're traveling with more than one person. The bathroom is smaller than you might expect, but this didn't create an issue.  The shower was a rainforest type with good pressure and temperature. Nice toiletries too! The restaurant is under renovation and I couldn't order room service, but this is New York!  I ordered from The Smith across the street.  I DID had a small glitch;4
I booked this trip for my daughterâs 18th birthday present, before we arrived I e mailed the hotel to ask if we could have a room with a view as it was a special occasion. We arrived around 9pm NY time and were promptly checked in, the room although small had a nice view of Maddison square gardens and was on the 25th floor. I wasnât bothered by the size of the room, we only showered and slept there. It was clean, tidy and the bed was comfy. Air con worked which was a god send as touching nearly 40 degrees on our visit.  The location is brilliant, walk to time square, Empire State, tube stations right outside too. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel as a whole very clean, it is an old building but reasonably decorated. We loved our time in NYC, the people are so;4
It's a good hotel, probably worthy of the 4 star rating that most reviewers give them.    PROS:  Outstanding location, better than the Sheraton a block away   Food options are good Rooms are large and spacious Hilton VIP's get nice treatment  CONS:  This year has got to be the one of a major facelift No shuttle to anywhere like the metro stop or City Walk Rooms need some TLC in 2011;4
Staff could not be more helpful with everything from directions to printing off tickets for us. Some of the decor was a little tired and in need of an update in the corridors and in the bathroom. The communal areas were to a high standard though.;4
"We stayed June 6th to the 11th - dropping my daughter off at Joffrey. The hotel is very charming, the lobby and lobby bar are on the small side.  So if you are looking for a massive resort style lobby, you won't find that here.  We did enjoy our stay, the front desk staff was accommodating but I would not say they went out of their way for anything - but note that we did not need anything special and thus would not need for them to go out of their way. I will say that the maid service was good.  We never ate at the Empire restaurant.  But we did eat at PJ's right next door (which hosted - from what we heard -  the Tony Awards after party, which was very good and for 7 people with drinks and full dinner and tip it was under 300; which is a steal for the area!  The pool deck was";4
The location is perfect for getting around, subway very close. Although the hotel is looking a bit tired, decor wise, we had a fabulous stay. The doormen were so helpful, the reception staff also great. Just a shame the free wifi doesn't extend to rooms and the coffee facilities in room are not free. I'd certainly return though, hopefully soon!;4
Nice hotel - very nice hotel close to many attractions. There is a very nice pool and poolarea. Service is good. Nice staf.  Breakfast  is great - only because of the two Guys that makes omelets in a row - they are so cool . But I warn you dont invite outsiders (friends) for breakfast, 40 dollars!!!! The most expensive single meal we had in LA!;4
Location perfect, staff is courteous and helpful, well organized and ran smoothly for a large city hotel. Room is simple but clean, meets expectations. The corridors could use a facelift. Check in was flawless and reception staff very helpful.;4
hotel room was small, which I expected, but was immaculately clean, and linens and furnishings were in very good shape. Other positives: half the price of midtown hotels, friendly staff, lively neighborhood with lots of dining options (in Chinatown, but easy walking distance to Lower East Side shops and trendy NoLiTa boutiques.)  Bonus points for being a half-block from Grand St. subway station, which was an express stop. You are in the theater district in less than 10 minutes (4 stops)! I felt very safe using subway late at night with teenage daughter.  Negatives: Shower has some kind of water-saving feature that causes the water to come in pulses instead of a steady stream. (but there was always hot water!) In lieu of a closet, there was a wall-mounted rack that was suspended;4
"Stayed December 2017 - The room itself was great, clean and spacious.  Apart from one member of the reception staff, I found the rest of them to be unhelpful and miserable.  A $100 holding fee was ""charged"" to my debit card (presume in case of damage etc to room) - in fact it was taken from my card and I've never received a refund despite numerous e-mails with their accounts dept.  My niece stupidly left a pair of earrings she'd bought as a present for her mother in law in the room (only realised once back in England) and again, despite the staff telling me they had found them, they made it impossible to get them posted back to me in England (which I would obviously have reimbursed them for postage wise).  Shame as I would definitely have stayed again at this hotel and have";4
Great location and great looking hotel. Excellent deco through the entrance area. Good room size and no city noise. Room was clean couldnât fault the cleanliness. Restaurants on your doorstep and Central Park 2 mins away;4
Stayed here with my friend for 5 nights, check in was great staff very friendly and let us check in slightly early which was nice after a long flight. Slightly disappointed with room size (Rm 2141) and view but it was okay, we had 2 double beds and we were not in the room much although I wish we had asked for an upgrade like others did but we still enjoyed our stay. The location is fantastic and I loved the history of the hotel which you can read about downstairs, the staff were all very pleasant and approachable and security was good as you cannot access the lifts without showing your room cards. We only ate in the Tick Tock Diner once but the food was good and the service was great. We would definitely return to the hotel but I would like a bigger room next time.  Itâs a great;4
Very nice accomadations!  Great location central to our interests.  Pleasant management and team.  Lounge area and lobby very comfortable.  Plenty of quality restaurants in very close proximity (It is NYC!).;4
This hotel is across the street from Lincoln Center. Cutting edge decor albeit noisy. Very comfortable beds. Friendly front desk. Really good choice if seeing a late opera across the street. Very sheet.;4
Excellent location for sight seeing, Madison Square Garden over the road, Empire State building close by and few minutes walk to Times Square and bus terminal. Room very clean and adequate. Staff lovely and security tight. Breakfast great in Tick Tock diner but dinner not so good. Art Deco lovely, very pleasant to sit and take in surroundings.;4
Hotel was very nice and staff was great as well. Location was good for Universal trip. Paid a little more that I would have liked to, plus the price for parking, but for a short stay it worked for us.;4
The room was light and airy, with air condition that worked without keep you awake at night.   Front desk staff friendly and helpful as always.   Breakfast freshly cooked and no waiting around for the next batch to come out of the kitchen.  Bar and Dinner very poor.    A member of staff poured whisky BACK into the bottle and the beer selection is not great and much of what there was, was out of stock.   Food served at dinner was fresh but a bit hap-hazard and not presented well and you do need to check what is on the plate is what you actually ordered.;4
Have stayed in a lot of hotels in NYC but chose this one because of proximity to the convention center. As I was here for a convention. What a nice old fashion deco hotel that is upgraded.  Nice job Wyndam! Small rooms and bathrooms (think Europe),but I was alone so no problem.  Very clean, comfortable beds, cool decor. Great service at front desk. If you are here for theater it couldn't be more convenient. A lot hotel for the price.;4
Close to metro but far from everything. Good one restaurant near by. Love to stay on first floor. The fan in the toilet is very loud and the toilet is little bit old. The floor a little bit sticky but over all is fine.;4
Most people probably say something exactly like this, but the hotel is very nice, although expensive. But it mostly makes up for that by being a really short walk from Universal Studios and its City Walk area.  We paid a bit more to stay on the executive level because it included breakfast and wasn't that much of a price difference. The rooms were nice and clean, but nothing incredible. Nice views, though.  The breakfast was tasty, even if basic. There are cold continental options and that's likely enough for most people, but one day we decided to splurge a bit and get the hot buffet also. I think it was $10 or $15 extra per person so although it's not ridiculously expensive, it is a bit lame that you have to pay again for a breakfast that's supposedly included. The hot options;4
A classic hotel. Stayed for four nights. It's not state-of-the-art, but it was in 1930. The rooms are clean and simple. Housekeeping thorough and helpful. Breakfast included is served at the Tic Toc next to the lobby, but is not recommend, service there not good. Nothing to complain about from the hotel staff though! And ultimate location when watching a show/match in Madison Square Garden or commuting from Penn station.   Very cool to have stayed at the New Yorker.;4
Me and my son have just returned from a 4 night stay. We were given a room on the 33rd floor with a great view of Madison square gardens. Check in was smooth. We loved the room- yes the bathroom is dated but itâs a 1920s hotel and we liked the fact it still had period features. Tick tock  diner was great ate there for dinner and twice for breakfast. Location wise this hotel is perfect not far from any of the attractions. The only negative was the elevators! Took upwards of 15 minutes in the morning would be full of people and stopping on every floor it was a nightmare. I would definitely come back in the future provided the elevators were fixed Thankyou for an amazing stay ð;4
I'm a Hilton Honours diamond member so always opt for the reliable Hilton brand.  This one didn't disappoint - comfy, spacious rooms, pleasant staff,  decent drinks and food and a good concierge service.  Hotel is great for visiting Universal Studios but also for visiting Hollywood and other areas of Los Angeles which are a short cab ride away. A few niggles - found the pool nice but very dirty both in the water and around the edge.  Needs some attention.  Also, the pool bar was open until 8.30pm on Friday and then only 6pm on Sunday which we found a bit odd.  The free breakfast for Diamond members was pathetic to say the least and no water in rooms.  Basically,  no extra privileges for Diamond members which was unusual.  Overall a nice stay but not the best Hilton I've stayed;4
I chose this hotel due to its location, and my satisfaction with stays at other Hilton properties. We used the shuttle each day to and from the park. We had a quality dinner after a long day at the park, and we enjoyed an early morning swim in the beautiful pool. Service was good, loved being able to fill our water bottles prior to departing for the park each morning. All and all a good stay although at double the price I pay at the Garden Hilton in the O'hare area, and I missed the coffee/tea bar in the lobby, but the entire purpose of our visit was Universal Studios, so it was perfect for our visit.;4
My family and I stayed here for 3 nights over Easter. The hotel is located in North Hollywood. The rooms were spacious, quiet and very clean. The check in staff were very friendly and helpful especially when I had trouble printing my boarding cards, Cynthia printed them for me and made me feel like nothing was a problem.  The children loved the breakfast as freshly made waffles were on the menu everyday as was sausages, eggs, cereal, cold meats and much more. The chap in the gift shop looked a bit miserable but in fact was totally the opposite he was very funny and extremely knowledgeable about the area. There are plenty of trips on offer in reception if you have forgot to book any like Disneyland. The restaurant isn't open on Mondays or Tuesdays and when we called to order food;4
Staying at the Jane is a unique experience, like being in the middle of a Wes Anderson movie - the attention to design and historic-luxe details.  Yes the rooms are crazy small, but comfy and well appointed.  Even the shared bathroom isn't so bad, when you consider the very-low price of the stay. The staff is lovely.  I love their uniforms. The bar is to die for, and we loved Cafe Gitane, the restaurant downstairs.  Great breakfast, amazing dinner.  The location, between West Village and Meatpacking district is also a super-plus.  I thought the bunk bed rooms would make me crazy from claustrophobia, but it wasn't so bad at all.;4
Excellent place to be residing for a short term. It's only 3 minutes away from the station which is in a shopping mall packed with amenities. The rooms are plainly decorated but are clean. Stayed on the 2nd floor with the view facing the sunset. Quite a romantic view if you block out your mind regarding that you're in a hostel. The hostel  has friendly staffs who are more than willing to help you.  I highly recommend this place;4
We love getting away for an overnight date in the city! I was thrilled to be a part of a fabulous competition called Art Takes Times Square and decided to use Priceline.com to get a hotel. You put in the amount you're looking to spend and the number of stars, your credit card number and then take whatever they give you. I put in $150, 3 1/2 stars or higher, the neighborhoods I preferred and up came the Empire!   We were thrilled with the location (right across the street from Lincoln Center) as it's close to everything, including the parking lot we use on 12th Avenue and 60th Street. It was a beautiful day - we strolled through Central Park to the upper East Side, down Madison Ave and back through the Park. That evening we walked to dinner with friends in Times Square - went to;4
My wife and I booked the Empire for a single night stay after a late evening in the Lincoln Center area on December 14th. I reserved the room for $150.00 on Priceline, and, for the amount I paid, it was a nice choice. The hotel has undergone extensive renovation, and, although the rooms are European-level small, they are clean and serviceable. We didn't use or check out the pool or the gym, but the idea that a hotel in this area had such amenities was impressive. You'll find yourself 1/2 block from Lincoln Center, which is a nice touch. Ed's Chowder House, the restaurant downstairs, has a nice buffet breakfast for the usual hotel overcharging price. Service at the front desk was friendly, and the lobby was inviting. The elevator I traveled in had a door that didn't open properly;4
We arrived on July 9th for a 5 night stay. On arrival we were offered early check in for $30 more which we gratefully accepted. I had been corresponding with Gisele on the front desk before travelling to confirm my booking with Booking.com and the price as it seemed very reasonable for 3 adults in July. We received a second floor modern room with 2 queen beds. The room was massive for the 3 of us and was exceptionally clean. Plenty of towels and toiletries although we prefer to use our own. There was a safe, a microwave and a fridge which we used to stocked up on juice and water  from Right Aid supermarket one block down to the left.  The pool area is very good. Comfortable loungers, pool towels, a water dispenser and more importantly a chair to help guests with disabilities;4
I stayed at this location for three weeknights in May.  The entrance to the hotel is tricky to find if you aren't looking carefully.  I valet parked my car my entire stay which was well worth the money for the amazing service! Once I checked in I was able to visit the pool which was clean and enjoyed relaxing in the large hot spa.  There are walkways to Universal which is right next door.  Ventura blvd is close by with many shops and eateries.  The lobby was always well staffed and everyone was very kind.  My room was large and had a great view of Universal and all the studios as well as the hills.  Nighttime was amazing with all the lights and the hills in the backdrop.  The only downside to me was the executive level service.  There was no executive lounge, only a continental;4
The New Yorker was everything we had hoped for, except it was extremely busy. It makes sense because the hotel is located in Time Square with the subway station - 34th and Penn just around the corner.   When we first arrived at the hotel after our red-eye flight around 8:00 am, we noticed a lot of people were standing around the lobby. There was a lot of hustle and bustle happening. As we approached the front desk, we checked in, but they let us know we would not have a room until after 2:00 pm. My boyfriend and I were a bit freaked out by this statement because we did not want to carry our luggage around the city.   The Front Desk staff told us we could hold our luggage with the bell desk for free. She was very nice, even though I knew she was stressed and busy, and she took;4
Beautifully decorated, easy check-in and very boutique feel.  The room was immaculate and I really loved the thoughtful subtleties (fresh rose on the nightstand, loaner umbrella, refrigerator and separate well stocked mini bar). The room is small (as expected from a boutique hotel) but cozy and bed/bedding were clean and comfortable.    Only 3 not so great things: 1) Room doors slam pretty loudly.  Some kind of hinge to slow them down would be nice.  2) Our room was on the 5th floor and we heard mechanical sounds that were pretty loud outside (I think they were the furnaces) 3) The toilet is a pretty tight squeeze and there was no hot water at 10:30am.    All 3 things weren't enough to deter me from returning if I paid the same Hotwire rate of under $200 per night for a standard;4
In my book, hotels are a lot like real estate, in that Location plays a huge role in the overall experience.  Anyone going to mid-town west-side Manhattan could do much worse than a stay at the Empire Hotel on West 63rd street - literally right across the street from Lincoln Center!  I had tickets to the Met, including dinner at the Grand Tier, and it was as simple as a  5-minute stroll across the street to get there from the Hotel - simple as pie!  I've noted other reviewers complaints about the condition of the hotel - and there are a few things that could be improved on to heighten the experience - but you're paying for a Four-Star property - not a Five - so you should expect some minor things to be a little less than perfect (I mean, who bases the value of their hotel stay;4
Stayed for a few nights on business and was very happy with the large room and nicely appointed bathroom.  Elevators aren't the fastest but they aren't the slowest either.  This is a fairly big hotel and has a full bar and restaurant along with a Starbucks and snack offering counter.  The walk to Universal Studios is fairly short but does have some steep elevations and stairs to get up to the level of the theme park and CityWalk.  Not a big deal if you are in reasonable shape.  If you are a huffer/puffer, you may want to take their free shuttle which is very reliable and frequent.   If you are driving, it is a very short drive to get to a Carl's Jr. and In-n-Out nearby.  Also a gas station to pick up food supplies if you don't want to pay the ridiculous room service charges for;4
Always wanted to visit NY . Hotel recommended by my son and wife who had stayed there before . Very friendly helpfull staff .  central for visiting the sites . Also near Broadway . Our hotel room was just what we needed for our 4 night stay . The only disappointing thing was no coffee / tea making facilities in room . Asked for room service for a coffee and was told upto 45min wait and surcharge . Door men helpfully especially Jeff .;4
Overall, we are pleased with our 3 day stay at the Ameritania. The location is great. Close to Times Square, restaurants, shows and the subway, the hotel is tucked away from the busier streets and hustle of the city, yet you're right there. Jeff the doorman added the personal touch to our stay. He was cheerful, friendly and took care of our luggage until our room was ready. The room had an enormous beautiful mirror in the room. It was was decorated attractively and was comfortable. Bedding was plush and inviting. Room (and bathroom) was very clean. Elevators were close by and came quickly, even when they were busy.  If you want a quieter room, opt for one of the interior rooms. We had an option to do that, but chose to have a view instead. The view wasn't worth the tradeoff-;4
we shared a queen suite btw 3 of us (my partner, myself and my mother). it gave us two bathrooms and that extra room provided us with more space just to relax in. so we didn't have a view except of the next building but i didn't come to NY to sit and look out of my window. we were on the 20th floor which meant all the lifts stop there... that is good news as the size of the hotel sometimes means a little wait for a lift. beds are very comfy, rooms and bathrooms were clean. location is perfect.. 2 blocks form the empire state, 10 mins to times square, across the road from the subway at 34th/penn street.  mid range price hotel. we arrived at 2 much to early to check in but the reception staff were very courteous about this and free  checked us in, so that we could store our;4
This is a nice hotel with big rooms especially for families with kids to stay. It is about 100meters from the Metro Station and bus stop. very close to amenities stores and restaurants as there are no working restaurants in the hotel except during breakfast. the hotel has a laundry room also which was very convenient for us as we stayed there for 6 nights and didn't have to go out for doing our laundry. Breakfast buffet is amazing with a wide variety to offer though we have to wait for a while for the eggs as there are only 2 egg stations. The swimming pool is small and located at the back of the hotel near the parking lot but we seemed to be having problems with our cards to enter the pool and had to always get someone from reception to open the gates. Would definitely;4
First time staying at the empire hotel in NYC- it is located right across from the Lincoln center & a block from Central Park! The staff is exceptional especially the door men who was always willing to help you with a cab or directions - every morning when I would be carrying my Starbucks (next door) & he would rush to open the door for me!!  There are several really good restaurants close by- rosa Mexicano - the smith & PJ Clark's is just next door - they have a rooftop pool & bar & a bar in the lobby!! A great find & the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that there is a Kuerig coffee in room but it is 3.00 for each pod u use- so I opted for Starbucks but really not a deal breaker at all-  Hotel was clean & room was cleaned thoroughly every day- will definitely stay again-;4
We stayed at the Ameritania as my partner had stayed there previously and it was such a good location being only  a short stroll to Times Square. The room was on the small side but I expected this being in Central NY. Nicely decorated with 2 VERY comfortable double beds,a large shower and tv. Not a lot of room to put luggage but I suppose people generally only stay a couple of days on average and don't bring much.  Central heating was a bit dodgy,the room was red hot most of the time which I find uncomfortable to sleep in but the beds were fantastically comfortable I must admit. The big downside for us was that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room...or the hotel! There was hot water/milk/coffee on the lobby bar between 7 and 10.30 am...apart from this no drinks;4
Daughter's choice ! As she is into retro this retro that this was Amelia's first choice Amazing building ! Rooms spacious very clean also  loverly and warm ! Shame restaurant is a diner but not to worry breakfast was good also lots of eateries in the area;4
We had a great stay, room was in the 18th floor, room was clean and comfortable. Easy walk to universal studios, self parking was easy as well. Would stay here again if we visit the area in the future.;4
I love this hotel for its Art Deco-style architecture, its location and the bed sheets! It is about a block or so from Penn (subway) station, few more blocks from Javits center and the Megabus stop. We reserved a room with two double beds and it was spacious enough. We enjoyed the view of the Empire State building from our bed (34th floor). The room itself and the bathroom were very clean with fresh towels and sheets with a crisp/cool feel. The room had a safe and a good quality hair dryer. It didn't offer a mini coffee/tea maker though. It has a lovely Art Deco lobby with good security (you have to show your room key in order to take the elevators). The concierge service was very helpful and friendly. The surrounding area was very pleasant as well with the well-known 34th St.;4
Front desk personnel are very professional, room is very clean and well prepared, and the only negative I could comment on would be the air conditioning system which we found to be quite noisy on an off all night because of the thermostat settings. Once we set the fan to low and constant speed, the problem when away. Shuttle service to and from LAX was a bonus.;4
The hotel was very nice and clean. Front desk staff were all very nice and even got us into our room at 2:30 vs 3. I was very sceptical about this hotel due to the negative reviews, but we never experienced anything like some of the reviews had said. The only thing I would have changed was out view of the brick wall. But it wasn't a deal breaker. We would definitely stay again in the future.;4
We loved our cute little room overlooking the brick wall next door.  It was tiny but had everything we needed PLUS the location was brilliant.  Easy access to the subway meant day trips were easy and fast.  Easy access to pizza delivery (huge huge huge!) meant great meals of famous NYC pizza.  Great place.  Highly recommended for the price.;4
I thought this was a great place to stay! a friend and I stayed there in May 2004 and had a great time. It is ideal for travellers who are going to be spending most of thier time outside of the room. we stayed on the 6th floor and had no problems with bugs/rats or other guests, the staff was friendly and we were checked in and out very quickly. The beds were changed daily and new towels were brought to us, the whole hotel had a great feel (but not so great smell) and the neighborhood was beautiful. what more can you ask for when only spending $79 in the upper west side???...the shared bathrooms were very clean and in 5 days I didn't have to wait once, the water temp. does change on it's own but otherwise it's great!..I will stay there again and I hope that if you are looking for;4
We were pleasantly surprised when we drove up to this hotel. The pictures don't do this justice. The rooms were clean and large, and the staff was quite friendly. Everyone was accommodating. I requested a handicap accessible room, but that was taken, so they gave me a king room which was just as large. I was able to bring my scooter into the room with no problems. We were supplied with a fridge, microwave and a safe.  The outside of the hotel was very pretty, especially in the back with the fountains, and they have a courtyard which was beautiful. I would book it again if I were going to LA again. They also had a buffet breakfast every morning.;4
Had a great stay for thanksgiving week. Room on 35th floor looking west out to Hudson River. Really quiet room. 4 of were comfortable and had Good sleep in comfy beds after a hard days shopping. TV was good and watched some movies. Loves the old style mixed with modern especially the art deco and so many retained details. Will definitely recommend a stay here and would stay here again. Staff very friendly.;4
Stayed one night while in New York to visit some friends and have fun.  While it is true they were still doing some renovations when we stayed, the staff was friendly and helpful and we didn't have any noise problems with residents or guests.  The room was spotless and very functional for as small as it was.  The bed was comfortable and temperature control was fine.  Bathrooms were extremely clean for being shared (they provide robe and slippers for you).  We (yes we) really liked the place, but I would not recommend trying to squeeze two people in one of these rooms unless you are both very small people.  Aside from our foolish attempt to cram two people into the bed, we would definitely recommend The Jane for any traveler looking for clean, safe, and very cheap accommodations;4
Walkable distance to times square and Central Park. Nice rooms and good service. Jeff left a great impression, very nice and helpful service! The A/C was very loud. We had a power cut but within 2 minutes after calling the desk a worker came to fix the problem.;4
We  planned a trip to attend the US Open tennis.  We love staying on the upper East Side, easy access via subway anywhere in the city.  Neighborhood has outstanding food choices and very friendly outdoor opportunities to eat.    We were unable to leave NYC as planned due to Hurricane Irma.  We needed to stay another few days but did not know how long it would take to get a plane ride home.  The manager on duty was JOANNA.  She was a saviour and  accommodated our needs;4
This is a very nice hotel in a very centric location in Manhattan. You can walk to major points of interest from it or you can get to the primary subway lanes to help you get anywhere. Half a block from MSQ and very near the Empire States building it has a great view of some of Manhattan iconic buildings by just walking outside its door. It should improve its breakfast offering. What includes is a voucher for a coffee/juice + muffin +fruit, a very poor selection for the price you pay for the rooms. By the way don't expect much space although if you are lucky they can accomodate you if you don't feel spacious enough.;4
The New Yorker's location across from Penn Station was excellent. The hotel was clean and bustling with tourist. However, the room size was so small I felt as if my husband and I had to move in tandem to get ready for our day. The room was clean enough, but sure could have used some maintenance. Staff was friendly.;4
We were looking for a hotel that was affordable and accessible in Manhattan, and we picked a great spot to rest our head.  It was a $25 taxi ride to the hotel from LaGuardia, and they were very accomodating and waiting for our arrival.  The hotel is in a great location, quite enough for sleeping, down the block from a great little store/cafe.  We literally only used the room for sleeping and showering.  It was small, but perfect for our needs.  There is so much to see in NY, you cant possibly want to stay there.  Central Park is right across the street and we walked the west side of the park into town.  Beautiful walk!!  Bagels & Coffee in the morning from either Morning start or a vendor with their carts, both were enjoyable.  We got the room through skyauction, always easy to;4
This Hilton is a nice hotel. The staff is friendly. They had a very good breakfast layout. The room was spacious and the blackout curtains were very nice. It is in walking distance to the main entrance to Universal Studios. I would come back to this hotel.;4
We enjoyed the corner king suite as a home base for a small group of girls reuniting for the weekend. The concierge was able to provide a mini-fridge for some food we brought in and was helpful all around. The pool wasn't open yet, but the room was great and view was captivating (traffic just never stops!) and beautiful (lincoln center). Black out curtains were a luxury we didnt anticipate but definitely enjoyed!;4
Nice hotel in good location, two lovely pubs nx door the Iguana and Three Monkeys, for last drink of the night before bed. Good access to Central Park,Times Square, and the subway on 50th St ........enjoyed my stay, which was made most comfortable by the lovely JEFF.......a wonderful man who was always helpful and happy to help. Helped us with a taxi to airport and shown us the free coffee and tea........only downfall on the whole trip was somebody on the second floor playing a trumpet ....short bursts, i complained at the desk.....;4
The remodel of this property [ former Radisson Hotel ] is very well done. Modern styling, spacious lobby,  large flat screen TVs in guest rooms. However, the size of the  bathroom in my queen size guest room was laughably small. To make matters worse, the door swung into the bathroom, making it impossible for one person to stand at the sink if the other wants to enter or exit the bathroom. Check-in and check-out were easy - just one issue, I reserved a king guest room and was assigned a queen guestroom at check-in. Still waiting for a resolution regarding this error.;4
The hotel room was small but comfortable. The shower was good. It is pretty close to the subway. I had a room only. We came to see New York and its Christmas lights. Mistake. Nothing like the pictures or films.;4
Perfect location in Hell's Kitchen. I always stay in this part of midtown it's close enough to Times Square where I can just walk to watch my Broadway plays and close enough to Central Park where I lime walking around. Hotel slightly dated but still has a fun, vibrant lobby and bar. Small breakfast room... my room did not come with breakfast it was an additional $11 for breakfast but hey I'm in NYC I could walk to any corner and get a great cheap breakfast. Great staff! Check-in was at 3pm but since I got in on the redeye they were kind enough to check me in. Got a room with 2 double beds. Very spacious and comfortable. They later on moved me and my boyfriend to a room with a queen size bed on a higher floor but room was much smaller. Still nice and had all the comforts for;4
We chose the Empire because of its amazing location. We were going to the opera and as it turned out, we were in NYC on weekend that was FREEZING!!! We were so happy to be so close to the Lincoln Center after the show was over. Check-in was easy, the room was very clean, and quiet. Two small complaints that could easily be remedied. First - no usable mirrors outside the bathroom (there was a decorative mirror that wasn't near an outlet). The bathroom is tiny - which is fine, but for any couple staying there, the woman has no way to apply make-up or dry hair in the bedroom. A mirror near an outlet would make things so much better. Second, I understand conserving towels - but no hand towel and no bath math. Small things that could easily be fixed. Even with these small issues, we;4
Makes the best Chuck Bass. Bar atmosphere is swanky and relaxed. Kenny is a great bar tender. Next time to NYC will definitely stay here. If you are a Gossip Girl fan it is a must to stop by! Love The Empire Hotel!;4
Great location right at Times Square stayed for a work visit. Room was alittle small but was clean.  Rating would be higher if it wasnât for a difficult to use heating system that reached 90+ degrees.   Overall good visit;4
Very attractive, clean hotel within walking distance of Universal Studios.  Even though I'm a HiltonHonors member I was told that even though they had rooms available if I wanted to check-in early I would be charged $25. Especially when only staying 1 night I don't expect to be charged extra in order to check-in at 10am when I'm checking out by 9am the next morning!!  Only stayed one night after a long day at the park so didn't use any of their facilities, but the room was very comfortable and we had a great view of the park.;4
"Stayed for a meeting and was offered a ""room with a view"" on the phone.  When I arrived the view turned out to be straight down 34th Street to the Empire State Building, so I could hardly complain.  The room itself was a bit small (not Japanese hotel small) but fully appointed with closet, desk, dresser/TV, and multiple plugs for all my devices.  The bathroom was fairly spacious and clean, although the shower was a little confusing (separate taps for tub/shower and hot/cold, so four in all), and one of the bolts on the toilet seemed to be a little bit loose.  Just minor things.  Sometimes the room was a little musty-smelling when I came back in the evening but this was easily cleared up by turning on the A/C.  The building itself is a nice 40-story art deco hotel with quite a";4
In answer to the last review, I got a room here through Expedia for 2 nights @ $73 a night plus taxes. Considering how dirt cheap that is for NYC, I was completely satisfied. No bedbugs (I did do a cursory check of the mattress and box springs, no sign of bugs), the sheets were clean, the TV and A/C worked fine. There was a pair of socks under the bed which I threw out, but other than that the room was clean. The bathroom was reasonably clean. When I took a shower, yes, there was some water on the floor and a few hairs here and there but that's because somebody else had just taken a shower. As far as I'm concerned that's to be expected. The room was small but no smaller than I expected. It was dark without the lights on - the window faced a brick wall about 3 feet away - but;4
Overall this hotel was really great - fantastic location, huge room with excellent facilities, lovely pool area, fab sauna. Our overall experience of the staff was also good - reception staff couldn't have been friendlier, excellent housekeeping and the ladies at the breakfast service were fantastic. But I must agree with the previous user's comments re Chef Hugo. I had a very unpleasant experience of him being very rude to me after I'd requested an omelette with primarly egg white but a dash of yolk. They had jugs of both sitting right there so just a case of splashing a bit of yolk in. The woman who was serving on my first morning did it without any problem. But when Hugo served me on my second morning he point blank refused and said it had to be one or the other. I explained;4
The Hotel itself isn't very fancy. But the price is right. Where this place shines is location and the people who work there. Are you reading this management? We checked in on the August 10th at around 2:30 pm..I wish I had gotten the names of the people at the front desk...2 lovely women. Everyone who works here is helpful and a delight to deal with. The room was average. The breakfast was great! The chef was a really nice guy and he made a great omelet! The hotel has a really nice courtyard. Nice place to spend some time after seeing the sights.;4
I had a double ensuite & paid Â£53.00 & expected from a hostel it was very basic but was very clean, there were cups, plates & cutlery provided in the room, plus towels. There was a wardrobe & a fridge in the room. There were plenty of kitchens on each floor & a little shop in the foyer that sold hot & cold drinks plus various types of food from sandwiches to ready meals etc to heat up in the kitchens. I never used the communal kitchens or bathrooms so can't comment on them. The bed was comfortable, the room warm & surprisingly quiet. If you want a cheap basic room in London then it's worth looking at. If you like the comforts & luxuries of a hotel then this place may not be for you.;4
This hotel is well located for visitors, the rooms are reasonable and clean and the staff are friendly. But the bathrooms are poorly designed, and there is little catering. Breakfast is in the converted roof bar and adequate rather than great and at weekends begins at 11am. We were given a free breakfast because the hot water was cut off for a while but then couldnât use it. But overall a good option.;4
Just returned from an 8 day/7 night Los Angeles Vacation. We are a family of 4 (2 daughters ages 20 and 18) from New York. We came to get an LA experience and wanted an upscale hotel in a safe area and not too far from the attractions. We had considered the Hilton and Sheraton Universal, Rennaisance Hollywood, Hyatt Century City and Andaz Hollywood. After checking out each hotel and it's location we were glad we chose Hilton. We carefully planned out this vacation so that we can get the most out of LA. WE flew in from NY on Delta and picked up our car rental (compact SUV) from Fox CarRentals. I was pretty concerned renting from Fox because I almost always rent from Avis, Alamo and National and never had a problem. But the price difference was significant so we tried Fox.;4
Mohamed at the Customer Service was fantastic! He went out of the way to be accommodating to our needs and gave exceptional service! Made us feel valued. The other customer service personnel and the rest of the staff we interacted with were great too. A very pleasant experience!;4
We stayed at Hilton Universal City on March 22, had a room on the 22nd floor which had a terrific birds-eye view of the nearby hills, streets and the freeway. Walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk.  The shuttle van to City Walk/Universal Studios came every 15 minutes or so, sometimes standing-room-only because he hotel was booked, but still very convenient. It also stops at the Sheraton next door, the only other hotel in the area. You can walk, but it is an awkward walk across the curving hillside road where cars are arriving to the park, so after dark or on a hot, rainy or busy day, the shuttle is a good option.   The rooms were up to date and very clean, contemporary style. Beds were very comfortable. Service was very good at the front desk and restaurant. We;4
Very nice hotel and well located for the price. Not too far from Hollywood by car. We managed to park in the street but don't forget to put some change in the meter from 8:00am (2hr parking).  Got late by 7 min one morning and got a 75$ ticket at 8:05am. The hotel has a private 25$ a day parking. We were trying to save. This hotel has a good ambiance with the central patio and a nice pool witch is rare at that kind of price... The furniture is showing some proof of usage and the the walls were spotted.  The floor and bathroom were clean.  Good beds and central AC. There was a little bar in the central patio area but we never saw it open! It was a nice spot for the morning coffee waiting for the kids to wake up. Would return.;4
"Stayed five nights at the hotel; had comfortable room - nice bed - clean.  Elevator wait was a bit of a nuisance, but one just has to be patient.  The check in/check out process was satisfactory, but had some trouble (I'm American) understanding the ladies behind the counter.  Or at least the one I dealt with.  None of them seemed to speak loudly enough over the hotel lobby music that played constantly.   Would stay here again.";4
Great location, great corporate rates, amazing rooms/bed, great views. It's an easy walk across the street to Universal City. My room generally has views of all the shows in the park. Restaurants are nearby and very easy highway access. This is my hotel of choice when I'm in LA for business.;4
We were able to obtain a refurbished room on the seventh floor and the decor was very nice but so small we could only get one suitcase on a stand with the other on the floor completely blocking the access to the desk and coffee machine. No instructions to operate the coffee machine so I filled it up, pressed the start button and water started seeping over the desk, so gave it a miss, just a card with simple instructions would suffice, the hotel needs to address this. All the reception desk staff were very helpful whenever there was a query (they did offer to send someone up to sort out our coffee machine but we were tired after a long journey and we declined)   The concierge was also helpful with any question I had, as was the transport guy at the desk who looked remarkably like;4
"The room was quiet and very comfortable for our 1-night stay. The only part I didn't like about the room was the window view.... looked out only on the nearby wall and windows of another section of the hotel. Service at front desk and the greeting at hotel entrance was very friendly and inviting. My wife loved the quaint look of the lobby furniture and decor as well as of the large staircase going up to the mezzanine. We enjoyed ""exploring"" the rooftop sitting/sunning area connected with the pool. As a lap swimmer, I realized immediately that I would not be using the pool.... quite small... but as we had more time, it would have been a comfortable place to hang out!";4
I stayed here a couple of weeks ago, knowing that it was a dated hotel in a not-so-glamorous part of town.  Iâve stayed in many hotels in NYC, from the Ritz Carlton to Hampton Inn.  I found this hotel to be quite desirable for my needs.  First of all, it was close to Penn Station, and I always go to NYC from Baltimore by train.  Also, when I did use Uber, my rides were not that expensive.  My room was small, but Iâm alone and donât need a large room.  I have a lovely apt. in Baltimore to come home to, so this room was clean and the service was great.  Iâd high,y recommend this reasonably priced hotel.;4
Really great fully re-done hotel in a 1920's-30's style. Marble floors, beautiful rooms and courtyard. Full hot breakfast. Beware though they charge an extra $20/day for parking. Area outside may seem a little sketchy, but being a resident of LA, just a few blocks north and your in Los Feliz, to the west is west hollywood/Hollywood/Beverly hills area, so a good central location. Late check in at 3pm was a hassle;4
Had a very nice stay at the Hilton with my daughter.  The hotel has a wonderful location, which is why we chose this hotel.  I think that the parking fee (24 dollars a night) is high and needs to have a microwave in the room.  I would stay here again needed the location as it is close to a lot.;4
We stayed in the Hollywood Hotel for four nights when we arrived in LA from Australia.  First off, the area is ok - we felt perfectly safe walking along Vermont Avenue, even at 10pm.  I wouldn't have gone down the side streets, but walking to the Rite-Aid and the Metro station was fine.  However, it isn't anywhere near as nice as North Hollywood or Beverly Hills.  The hotel itself was very nice - clean and modern.  I think we stayed in a modern room, as the furniture and floorings were all new.  There is a nice courtyard in the middle of the hotel, where guests can go for a drink or just relax.    The service was ok - we were able to check in early, however other then that, the staff were not overly helpful.  They try to sell a tour which is obviously affiliated with the hotel,;4
Great service from the reception team despite a few technical problems. Room was a little on the small side but we were in a corner. Very clean and comfortable. Great access to a number of sites, and right next to the park.;4
We were booked into this hotel following a disaster with our travel agent who had booked us into something horrendous.  Due to this on arrival we were very sceptical and wary.  Having travelled early in the morning and not arrived at the hotel until quite late on, we were both tired and just needed things to be hassle free!  Well I am delighted to say that hassle free is what we got for the whole of our stay here.  The receptionist who checked us in was very friendly and helpful and our room was immaculate.  Facilities were quite basic but very well kept and the cleaners did a great job with room cleaning and fresh sheets and towels daily!  The concierge staff were so helpful to us in directing us to various attractions we had booked and I must say that the hotel is very well;4
Nice hotel with helpful staff â¦â¦.room is small, but it is not small for Manhattanâ¦acceptable shared bathrooms, I  recommend this hotel for any one want to enjoy  Manhattan without spending a lot of money .;4
We had a fabulous stay. Booked 2 rooms (King & adjoining 2 queen) for my daughter's 11th birthday. She had received her invitation to Hogwart's by owl and we needed to get up there ASAP. Unfortunately, the LA traffic delayed us and we missed going in Friday night. My daughter was distraught - but the front desk was fabulous! Laura comped us breakfast for the next morning AND sent up a lovely birthday card to brighten the evening. The rooms are stylish, beds heavenly and decor up to date. It is a bit pricey - but I guess it's 'location,location,location'! 5 minute walk to the entrance of the park and the shopping/eating area. We'll definitely be back. Thank you Hilton!;4
We had problems with our reservation due to a misunderstanding and at the check in reception the manager Pasquale was very helpful and efficient and solved our issue quickly and he was really accountable;4
We stayed for 5 days in early December, the room was impressive and clean though we were in one of the recently refurbished rooms on floor twelve (1226).  The en suite was very good with a fantastically powerful shower. A coffee machine , iron and hairdryer is provided.  At night the room was extremely hot even though it was the first week of December but the air conditioning was very good.  We didn't opt for breakfast as the hotel is surrounded by really good diners and various types of restaurants. For a New York Diner experience try The Big Daddy Diner further down Broadway.  I would definitely book this hotel again as the staff were polite and helpful and is very well located near 96th street subway station.  The only negative of our trip was that at night when you just want;4
Great location for arts lovers, just across the road to the Lincoln Center, close to Carnegie Hall and easy access to all major galleries and museums.  Central Park a few blocks away lovely in the snow;4
First time to this hotel. We book twice because we extended our stay. When we first arrived we were give a two queen bed room that was very old and a bit dirty. After complaining, we were given a better room. The second part of our stay we were given an even nicer one bed room. The staff were all very nice and the free full breakfast was great. my husband and I would stay again.;4
I was worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews on Trip Advisor, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The reception and lobby are nicely decorated and I found the staff to be friendly and helpful.    I booked a junior suite as it didn't cost much more than a double room and I was very glad I did.  The room was very spacious with a sofa and coffee table, desk and dining area, kitchen with microwave, coffee maker and fridge, walk in wardrobe and a large double bed which was very comfortable.  The room was very clean with plenty of towels, complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom.    Housekeeping were excellent and when the do not disturb sign was used we were not bothered.  They would always come back later in the day.  We took our laptop as the room;4
hotel is facing madison square garden and only a few minutes walk to Times square and empire state building in either direction.  our room was indeed in an old part of the hotel and resembled what it is ....a hotel with heritage.I  loved seeing the old pictures of the hotel hanging in the lower lobby. even though the corridors and doors looked akin to 1950's the furnishings are the opposite. such beautiful comfortable beds and amazing power in the shower. seriously refreshing after a day in new york city. staff were all very pleasant and helpful. the location of the diner attached to hotel was brilliant great for the big breakfast! again staff here were great. also the coffee dock in the lobby is very handy for anyone who wants a lighter breakfast. would recommend this hotel and;4
Impressive building with history that's a good base to explore from. A few annoying bits are the elevator system, particularly at check out with up to 20min waits to get down to the lobby and also the relatively high facilities charge. But otherwise a perfectly acceptable room and hotel.;4
This hotel was a great location. We enjoyed the short walk to Central Park and shopping. The rooms are rather small so we got a king suite which was great. The staff was helpful and friendly. The hotel was clean and quiet.;4
The hotel itself is gorgeous, some minor repairs and upkeep needed here and there but thatâs understandable in such a busy place! The view from the rooftop is next to none, you get such a different view of New York without the crowds of being at the Empire State. An incredible place to visit, especially if youâre a gossip girl fan.;4
The hotel is well located, on the corner of broadway and west 54th. I stayed here for a holiday for 10 days and had exceptional service and support from the staff and in particular Julian the door man. A mere 10 minutes from the heart of Broadway's theatre district, MOMA, Central Park, Columbus circle and easy access to the subway, makes this hotel great for work or pleasure. Easy access to restaurants along broadway and down eighth avenue.  The room I had was big enough for one for an extended stay, with a spacious bathroom and all the amenities. I had a couple of minor room dramas (my doing) for which service were really helpful in responding to.  To top it off, the lobby bar makes the best dirty martinis!;4
Stayed 4 nights in a theme park view suite in early October. Nice, clean spacious room, comfortable bed. Very very good location, great customer service. Onsite under cover parking.   5 - 7 min walk to the front gate or there is a shuttle to city walk. So very good location to stay at whilst visiting universal studios hollywood. The theme park area is really nice area to stay in away from the LA crazyness.  I recommend to pay extra for a theme park view.;4
Stayed here for three nights in December, hotel is clean, rooms are clean and functional.   The staff are all very friendly especially Jeff on the door!   One thing to keep in mind is that the rooms do not have double glazed windows and as mine faced out onto Broadway the noise through the night was terrible and sleeping was a struggle however other than that it is a great hotel in a brilliant location for access to Times Square, Grand Central Station, Empire State Building and Lower Manhattan etc. I will certainly recommend staying here.;4
The hotel was a fabulous location near times square, the hotel itself was great. Our room was a little on the small side but to be honest it didn't affect our stay as we weren't in the room very much.  The only thing I would say would be to include basic tea & coffee facilities in the room as there weren't any and we had to keep sending out for hot drinks which was a pain TBH.  Jeffrey on the front door was excellent very friendly and helpful.  Great trip to my favorite place in the world and can't wait to go again. xx;4
Hotel ist located dierctly at the central park . two block to the underground . only 4 rooms per floor facing the central park and you have a good view . The room are not large but ok . The staff is friendly . The bathrooms are new and very clean . The furniture is ok . The beds are comfortable ,only the aircondition is very loud . A good location for a short stay .;4
Stayed a few nights as part of our honeymoon trip. Room was modern and comfortable. Great location close to central park. Staff were good. Unfortunately, had a lot of trouble with the  WiFi that couldn't be sorted. Helpful doorman.;4
Clean rooms, breakfast every morning very good, helpful people at reception, small pool area but if you go to LA you don't go to hotel and sit at a pool I think, nice courtyard with bar, they have sauna and fitness but I didn't use it, bus stop near entrance and about 10 mins walk from subway station (in the evening however I didn't always feel safe walking from subway station back to hotel because of some aggressive homeless guys);4
We arrived to the hotel late at night after a night out and had a problem with our room. We called the front desk and spoke to Jorge, who happened to have also checked us in the night before.  he was extremely helpful and despite the late hour took about 5 minutes arranging a new, bigger and better room than we had initially reserved.  I was very impressed. To be sure, this is no 5 star hotel (you already knew that), BUT the great location next to a subway station make it an exellent bargain. For us, Jorge's help when we needed it made a great place to stay.  If you are planning to enjoy New York on a budget, this a great place to start. We had a very nice five nights stay in an excellent suite on the 12th floor.;4
This hotel provides very dependable services.  One thing we have noticed is that the staff has very little turnover from year to year...always a good sign for any business.  The breakfast in the dining room downstairs is consistently good--about the same thing every day, but enough choices to satisfy any reasonable person.  The eggs look a little strange(they look more like pancakes..we checked the ingredients..looked okay to us)  but are tasty'  They have added fresh fruit since the first year we stayed there and this is a welcomed addition.  The pool is very pleasant (if a bit cool some days) and appears to be very well kept and the pool area is private and attractive.  The rooms vary quite a bit in size, shape and details, but all have been fine.  Those with larger bathrooms;4
We went there to drink at the hotel bar.  Michael Zamora was the manager on duty that night, and he was a great help in selecting drinks and making sure that we were happy with our service at the Empire bar.  It was a great atmosphere, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.;4
Excellent room at an excellent price.   the Bed was extremely comfortable, and the staff was excellent. Roof-top bar was outstanding.  Incredible Location right across from Lincoln Center.  Restaurants, transportation... away from the hassle of Downtown.;4
We booked via Expedia and stayed 4 nights on arrival in LA.  We found the hotel comfortable and clean and the free breakfast was a bonus (not fantastic quality but a good range of items, and I don't get the impression that U.S. hotels in this price range really excel at breakfast generally.  This was certainly the best we ate where any was provided).  Pool was nice.  We got a good, large, quiet  room so I'm unclear as to why a previous review said they reserve rubbish rooms for Expedia customers, as this clearly wasn't the case for us.  I also didn't think the area was rough - it felt a bit deserted at night but not dangerous.  And there are some great places to eat up towards Los Feliz if you're prepared to walk or drive about 10 blocks north.  Only downside was secure parking;4
We are a couple traveling with our 6 year old daughter. We stayed here Saturday to Monday. We arrived on Saturday at 2:00 pm, before check-in time, and the front desk staff was very accomodating and got us into a room right away. The room was clean and spacious and nicely decorated. We had a room with two beds and I noticed that the beds were a little small. I think that they were double beds rather than queen size. Upon getting settled we headed down for an afternoon at the pool.   The pool is a bit small, but had a nice area around it with lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas. We found a table to sit at right away, but noticed that the rest of the chairs and tables quickly filled up and people had to lay towels on the grass to sit. There is a bar by the pool where they were;4
Excellent location for Lincoln Center. Comfortable bed, linens and great shower. Reasonable breakfast buffet for NYC.Very accommodating staff. Would stay again when in the area. Recommend that a full size ironing board be provided in the room. Asked and one was dropped off but all hotels Iâve stayed in provide standard size.;4
We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a 2 week trip to California/Nevada. Upon arrival it's easy to see what a great location it's in, being a 5 minute walk from Universal Studio's and even less to City Walk.   We checked in and noticed it's slightly old fashioned and could do with a bit of renovation (which, to their credit, they are in the process of doing to some area's). The staff were reasonably pleasant and polite, although the wait for check-in was a little longer than I'd have liked.   We went to the room are were impressed with how large it was for a standard room. We had a king bed, a large bathroom and a pretty good view of the freeway, mountains and the city skyline in the background. The A/C was good and not too loud, the the comfort of the bed was out of this;4
Second time in 5 years at the New Yorker. New Yorker always serves its purpose whilst visiting the Big Apple in such a great city I do not spend much time in my hotel room.  One point to note despite my wife and I having 4 bags a stroller and a 3 year old. Not one doorman opened a door for us and also on check in not one member of staff offered to take our bags to our room leaving us to struggle in reception and up the elevators.;4
I had previously stayed here 5 years ago. It was great to come back to familiarity. Not much has changed to the hotel. It still feels very welcoming and laid back (maybe the elevator doors seem a little angry though). I had a deluxe king room on the third floor. It was adequate in size and had everything you need during a stay. However, when I visited in January, it was particularly cold and the bathroom was freezing as there was no heating in there, Overall, I cannot really fault Ameritania and would stay there a third time without hesitation. Special thanks to doorman, Jeff, who kindly organised a ride back to the airport. Our driver was great and he played some cool chilled tunes on the way.;4
Good quality hotel in key location if visiting Universal or North Hollywood area. Excellent rooms  and large comfortable beds. Also blinds cut out all day light. Car park a little pricely but no other options ... Only let down by overtly complicated (and hence long) booking and checking out procedures. There is no need to show people to the levator each time.   Also let down by costly wifi.;4
This hotel is in a great location, right across from Lincoln Center and just a couple blocks from Columbus Circle and Central Park .  There's nice subway access also.  My room was an adequate size but the bathroom was extremely small. My toilet did not work properly and after bringing it to the attention of the front desk, no engineer ever showed up to fix it.  However upon checkout, Mr. Ze did knock off $100 from my night's stay to compensate for that. Our business meeting was held on site - the meeting room was very comfortable and our breakfast and lunch were quite good. The great location would bring me back.;4
Not the nicest place I have ever stayed but... Very clean, friendly helpful staff and a lovely walk into the hussle and bussle of Times Square. If you are on a budget you couldnt go wrong its everything you need, a place to sleep after a busy New York day. We went as a family and had rooms next to each other. We arrived early and the staff looked after the luggage, they sorted out a car to take us to the airport. The little Deli nearby ( top of the park near the subway) did a lovely BLT for breakfast along with a coffee which was lovely to sit in the park and enjoy.;4
The hotel was a bit old but still decent. Rooms were spacious. Front desk and staff gave good service. I got to see the room and floor Nikola Tesla stayed in that was really cool. I would stay here again. Great location in the city! Close to good spots and stores. Everything in walking distance.;4
This is one of the cheapest places I could find to stay in New York in a reasonable area- I love to stay in the Meatpacking district as it is close to clubs and shopping. Only thing is if you pay less you stat in a tiny room and share a bathroom which is new to me but I found it ok. The hotel has a popular bar downstairs known for celebrity spotting. The staff are incredibly helpful- the airport lost my luggage and they did everything they could to help. The hotel is very close to shops and clubs but about two blocks from a subway stop which was slightly inconvenient.;4
"This is a boutique hotel with great value in price and location. The single room I had with one queen bed was ""European"" small but clean and well appointed with amenities. WiFi costs $9.95 for 2 devices. But it is the location that is the star. Adjacent to Times Square, Theater district,  and the Ed Sullivan Theater, it is extremely convenient.";4
Conveniently close to several subway lines. The internet was fast enough to stream TV and get work done, but it isn't free unless you book a particular deal. They offer breakfast for a cost and free coffee, both of which I didn't try. Elevators are slow, but there are three so the wait wasn't horribly long. I'd stay here again.;4
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for one night before starting our tour of California. The hotel was a little out of the way for us but fine for a one night stay. Wouldn't have been central enough for us for a longer stay. Room was large, bright, clean comfortable and overlooked the courtyard area. Lovely breakfast the next morning, including waffles, omelettes all freshly made.;4
This is our second time at the Wyndham.  I book a suite queen which give us some extra room.  The coffee maker is a nice addition.  The lobby is lovely and the Tic Toc Restaurant next door  has delicious food.;4
The hotel is conveniently located close to the 101 freeway and literally across the street from Universal Studios and City Walk.City Walk has a myriad of food,entertainment and shopping choices in a lively,entertaining venue.  The hotel was welcoming and our room was spacious and upscale.The king size bed was much too hard for our taste and the A/C,which was not working but repaired immediately after calling guest services.  We ate breakfeast in the hotel's sit-down restaurant each of the three mornings of our stay.On the first day the pasties were stale.After pointing this out to the restaurant the pastries were fresh and tasty for our last two days.  The bell staff was excellent but the front desk crew was not at all impressive - dull and unsure.The hotel has many business;4
Just next to the Penn Station and the Madison Square Garden the location is near unbeatable. This is an iconic Art Deco building with a lot of charm. (Must check out their historical archive on display in the basement)   While comfortable, the rooms are showing age and is good time for them to consider renovation.;4
Great location on Upper West Side, one block to 72nd subway station with access to 1, 2, 3, and 9.  Levain Bakery, Buttercup Bake Shop, and Grey's Papaya all within 2 blocks.  Great rooms, lots of space, clean, apartment-style accomodations.   Great price--$101 per night with taxes.   I love this place and will go back on my next trip to NYC.;4
Very comfortable hotel with great staff, very nice pool and very clean. The breakfast is also nice with great choice. Rooms are comfortable and clean and the location is great with lots of nice places to get around. Only very small problem- the handle of the shower is really hard to use, we had to call the reception to ask for help! But otherwise everything was great here!;4
Nice hotel, centrally located. Loved the overall vibe. Beautifully decorated. Thankful for the luggage valet before check-in. Checkout process was easy. The beds were super comfy and the bath amenities were nice. A few issues with the building being old (e.g. elevator had some problems operating, etc), but overall a great stay!;4
I've stayed here a couple of times and it went from being a tired dirty hotel to the best airport hotel at LAX! Great job Hyatt. Breakfast is solid and the service is good. They have a shuttle that runs regularly to and from the airport. Solid!;4
We always stay at this hotel when we come to LA. Yes the rooms are in need of a renovation and there seems to be an ongoing problem with the lifts but the location is just perfect - not only for visiting Universal Studios but if, like me, you are not a confident driver then it's a dream to get to from the freeway and there is a subway just at the bottom of the road. Lovely pool, friendly staff. Food/drink overpriced but typical for many LA hotels. Love that the rooms have a empty fridge to store water and enough for 4 cups of coffee/tea which is rare.;4
Spacious lobby, top-notch security, very gracious staff.  I liked that you had to show room key to get access to elevators.  Room was tastefully appointed closet.  Outstanding bar in the basement.  Nice location, walkable to either Penn Station or Hudson Yards.;4
"Stayed again at Hollywood Hotel on a recent visit to Los Angeles. There for 3 nights and using public transport. Good location between two Red Line metro stations. Friendly and helpfull staff. Breakfast included although on one morning line up for ""eggs cooked as you like them"" was long as only one person on cooking duties. Skipped the eggs that morning. Room was clean and tidy. Fridge and microwave in room great idea. Tour operators do pick-up from hotel. Would stay there again when Los Angeles";4
This hotel when it's on special offer is hard to beat. This is my second time staying here.   Overall the service is great, its family run so the staff are very attentive and efficient, good sized rooms, always kept well, daily room cleaning, and Hugo's freshly made omelette's are fantastic, and as I stay for a week, he knows exactly how to make them.   Only down side is when I have a car, I don't stay here as its 25 dollars a night for the car. And guest parking is charged for also. The bar is limited, Sunday it closed at 7pm.  Overall its good value for money with great staff. A home away from home.;4
The hotel was very good with excellent service , the breakfast was really good although not cheap ( around 70$ for 2 ). There is a shuttle to universal city every 10 min for free which is really really helpful ! The location in my opinion is one of the best , as itâs far from the traffic and has a good view , and itâs close to the metro.  The rooms are clean , room service excellent but a little problem was with ventilation as there are no windows that u can open in the rooms, but thatâs not a big problem ! Overall the hotel is very good and clean with great service and the staff is super kind and nice ! We had a good time in LA and I recommend it for everyone :);4
We came here for an event, instead of as hotel guests. The hotel is really close to the Universal Studio, together with several other hi-end hotels. The venue looks great, and the service was good. You have to pay to park in the garage. But this is totally understandable and expected.;4
Really good location.  Helpful doormen and bellman.  Guest services quick and efficient. Rooms are clean and spacious. Good coffee served in the lobby. Close to Broadway,clubs and restaurants. I'll stay here again;4
The closest hotel to Universal Studios, Hollywood, lives up to the hype. The Hilton is only steps away from the main gate, and we got our tickets to U.S.H. thru a package we bought on the Hilton website,  Check-in was quick, and we had a room ready although we arrived at 10:30AM. Went directly to the park. When we came back, we were greeted by a basketful of goodies, including two bottles of water, fruit, cookies and the likes.   Did not use the restaurant on-site as we walked to CityWalk for dinner.  The hotel was experimenting elevator issues on our way back but they were fixed by the morning.  Overnight, the air conditionning made the exact same sound as if someone on the upper floor was flushing a toilet, everytime the motor kicked it. Were awoken by that a few times.  The;4
I typical Hilton with all good stuff. And nothing to beat the location. 2 min walk from the main gate of Universal. The area is so peaceful and views so great. You can go up and down to Universal one or two times. Or juts for an evening walk again. its just lovely.;4
This hotel is just walking distance from Universal Studios and Universal City Walk. It was a 5 minute walk using the pedestrian bridge so you don't have to worry about crossing the street. This hotel is also a great location if you want to sight see in LA. But I didn't like having the daily parking fees, slow elevators (there was one elevator out of service so we had to either wait long or just took the stairs) and their food was ok but pricey. But I would use this hotel again for our next trip to Universal Studios.;4
We were going to the city to celebrate a family members birthday. I decided to booked a room via Trip Advisor at the New Yorker for one night rather than travel back home that evening. Although I go to the city frequently, this was my very first stay at a NYC hotel. The New Yorker is in a great location, walking distance to Madison Square Garden, Macy's Herald Square and other shopping, Empire State Building, etc. There is also a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel as well as a Starbucks, Duane Reade, pizza place and CVS very close by.  On arrival, the hotel lobby was bustling with people. Front desk personnel were friendly and welcoming. Check-in took a while, their systems were running slow. The hallways are narrow and frankly a little dreary. My initial room was horribly;4
Higher end Hilton with full concierge to help plan your visit, bell hop to store luggage after check-out, a full bar and restaurant.  The prices are reasonable for the convenience of safely parking under the hotel (for a fee), and there is an amazing food buffet offering.  The hotel itself is a little tired, but they were upgrading the elevators at the time of our stay.;4
The staff was very accommodating to all of our needs. The rooftop was amazing and perfect when you needed some air or extra space.  Great location by Central Park and the Lincoln Center.  I will definitely go back!;4
If you visit New York and arenât sure about staying right in Times Square, then this is a good hotel option. You can easily get to Times Square with the subway, which is at the corner right at the hotel and takes only about 15 minutes. The subway will drop you off at 50th street, which is right at the theater district. The area also gives you exposure to a nice neighborhood feel with still lots of shopping and restaurant options. The 94 Corner Cafe is right across the street and offers great food. Very safe area and lots to see and do. The hotel is a little older, but it was very safe.;4
definitely more money than i would like it to be but it was very close to universal city & universal studios, big rooms with big windows nice property big lobby with good pool, i'm glad i stayed at the top of the hill to eliminate walking & crowded trams, HOWEVER our A/C didn't work and the mechanic said they couldn't fix it until we checked out but the hotel lobby hallways and all indoors was very cold probably about 60 degrees so it wasn't a problem plus they brought a high power fan which was even better because it worked and most hotels don't have fans i'm also a weird kinda person who sleeps with a fan on for noise so it was even better good sleep quality and strong walls with good curtains, I WILL DEFINITELY STAY HERE AGAIN IF I'M IN THE AREA;4
Incredible welcome on checking in. Hotel is in a fantastic location close to main subway station, Macyâs etc. Found the team who sold tours etc a little brusque and impatient which is completely at odds from the rest of the staff we encountered. Do think the bathrooms could be updated, without losing their original charm. But all in all a great experience and we would happily return !;4
Stayed here between 13th and 17th July 2017. Checked in by Ali who was speedy and efficient. Was given a room upgrade which was a bonus.....this is my 5th stay at The Ameritania so it was lovely to be 'recognised' The Ameritania is on 54th street and just off Broadway so in an ideal location.....not far from Times Square but far enough away to not have too much noise. Hotel, clean and tidy although housekeeping didn't turn up until late on two days......4pm and 3.30pm which was annoying. We had to chase in one of those days also.;4
According to the people's reviews that the hotel is old and the customer service is poor but in my opinion its a beautiful hotel not that fancy as its name. Customers service is nice and polite like Nancy R and her co-workers everyone was helpful. The beer store is just accorss the street, for transportation use Uber. If I have the chance ill come back again : );4
I can't say enough about how the management made me feel as a guest here. I used hotel points to stay here and therefore they knew that I was an honored rewards member. Immediately after check in a hotel manager began texting me to welcome me and see if my stay was going well and if there was anything that I needed to let her know. I have NEVER experienced such great customer service before. it was unexpected and refreshing. we stayed overnight and visited Universal Studios during the day and the City Walk in the evening. it wa a short walk that we preferred doing instead of taking the shuttle. Our view of the hills and valley was spectacular and the room was decent. we had a great time.;4
My boyfriend and I stayed at the Empire after getting a great price through Priceline.  The location is very handy.  Right across from Lincoln Center/Central Park and close to the subway.  The decor was very cool.  Contemporary, earthtones and some shine.  The problem was our tiny room, or perhaps I should say the bathroom.  The small bedroom was do-able because we were only in our room to sleep and get ready in the morning. But the bathroom was something else.  There was practically zero countertop space to fit our toiletries.  We had to keep them in the room where the bed was and bring items into the bathroom to wash our face and brush our teeth - let alone putting on my makeup.  Another problem was there was consistently no hot water.  The shower was a rainforest type-spray;4
My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker for 6 nights and apart from the initial (it lasted about 60 seconds-I shut it down pretty quickly) sales pitch to buy a time share it was the perfect fit for us.  The staff were attentive, helpful and polite.  Rooms were clean and a decent size.  We had an incredible view from the 37th floor.  The hotel has two restaraunts:  a diner and also a little Itallian restaraunts.  This hotel is within reasonable walking distance from Time Square and the Empire State Building.  Other attractions (Statue of Liberty ferry, Wall Street and Central Park are a bit farther but we walked everywhere.  The fitness center is decent with some, weights (both machines and free weights and of course cardio equipment.  We would definitely stay here again.;4
"This is a charming boutique hotel in the heart of Manhattan.  They upgraded me to a ""much larger"" room with two beds and I actually had room to walk between the beds and the mini fridge.  By the way, unless you are independently wealthy or on a hefty expense account, don't even think about taking anything from that mini fridge or snack tray.  The 8oz  diet coke is $7.50 and the individual size bag of chips is $4.50.  I went to the little grocery store a block down the street and got cans of diet coke for a dollar.  Having said all of that it is very well located.  Within walking distance to many of the most important attractions, including Broadway. The staff was very friendly and efficient.  There is no ice machine or vending - ice has to be sent up from room service, which";4
Great location, average accommodation, really good experience overall. The location of this hotel more than makes up for any shortcomings. I would definitely stay here again. If you want luxury, luxury, luxury then don't bother but for travel on moderate to budget income its great. Two restaurant/cafes on site to choose from. The Trattoria Bianca is very well recommended. Staff are great.;4
Hi.  My family stayed here on Jan 11th, 2018.  Very convenient location and friendly staff.  The shuttle is awesome, but walking is easy also.    We ate at the restaurant and the food quality is worth the price!  Manager is very helpful!;4
We stayed in the Ameritania Hotel for four nights in December 2017, great location!  Our room was on the second floor towards the back of the hotel so there was no street noise.  The room was very quiet, clean and well appointed.  All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  We did not have breakfast in the hotel, instead we went to Cascade Cafe for breakfast, few minutes walk from the hotel on the corner of W 54th St/8th Ave  -great food. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel for future trips to New York City.;4
We stayed for two nights at the end of October. Hotel is spotless great facilities and a top location for Universal Studios.  Located adjacent to a busy motorway the view is nothing special, but perfect for access to universal, a short walk away.  Food was good, but very expensive for what it was. Nice pool and surroundings good service from the pool bar.  Staff very helpful and professional.  Itâs around a fifty minute taxi ride from the airport at a $100 a pricey ride.;4
An Art Decor foyer and an American 24 hr Diner at one end and Italian at other, located right beside Penn Station on 34th and 8th Avenue.   An old fashioned hotel with some history, located virtually beside Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station and short walk to Macy's and Empire State Building.  Easy direct access from the Airport to Hotel at around 12.75 dollars by using JFK Airtrain to Jamaica street and then connecting to LIRR to Penn Station which again is a land train and not subway.   New Yorker is well located  on 34st and 8th Avenue and easy 15 minute stroll to 42nd St and Times Square.  The rooms are a tad small and old fashioned but all clean and towels and room cleaned every night .  Guest services are attentive and good security for access to lifts and rooms.  As;4
I have been to the Empire before and had a better experience in those earlier visits.  The room was not well ventilated.  I had to wait for 45 minutes before I could claim my room (even though I arrived at 3:30).   I will be back but hope for a better memory.;4
My wife and I stayed here in December 2012.  Great location for easy access to the Upper West Side, Times Square and subway stations.  The hotel was very trendy with a rooftop bar that attracted long lines of visitors each weekend night.  This was not a problem for hotel guests as you could walk right by them to get in and even get quick access to the roof if you wanted to see Central Park and the UWS.  The hotel room was small, but we booked on expedia so that was expected.  The odd smells in the hallway were not expected.  It may have been a neighboring room, but the smell dissipated after a couple days.   The small room was reminiscent of many European hotel rooms.  There's just enough room to walk around the bed and a bathroom with enough person for one room to stand up.;4
"Let me start by explaining how close I was to give this hotel a 5/5 review; Not that close really, but this is a good thing - let's find out why.   Now a 5/5 review would have meant the hotel would have competed in a totally different price-class especially with it's near perfect location on Manhattan and the services they provide. The Empire provides (almost)first class service at a fraction of first class rates.  On this trip I traveled together with my fiancee, her best friend and my mother - a company of four, and out of all the hotels I contacted in NYC the Empire was one out of four I found that could accommodate us all together in a suite with two separate bedrooms. For reference, the others was the Waldorf Towers and others in the same price-range. But where the Waldorf";4
We stayed here on a Thursday night so that we could hit Universal Studios first thing Friday morning without having to commute through LA traffic. It worked out perfectly. Once outside the hotel, it's a one-block walk to a bridge that leads directly to the Universal security line. Paying for one night of hotel parking ($28) also allowed us to keep our car in the hotel parking garage until 6 pm of checkout day.   The hotel itself is nice. The room with 2 double beds was plenty big enough for our family of four. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant or order any room service, but, if the free cookies at the check-in desk are any indication, the food must be quite good. My only complaint is that the shower took forever to get hot in the morning, and the shower head itself was not;4
From the desk to the doorman everyone was friendly and attentive and very responsive and helpful. There were a couple of problems in our room which were fixed very nicely and promptly while we were out. Most satisfactory.;4
Me and my husband stayed here for 4 nights.good spacious rooms with all basic amenities from toiletries to refrigerator and a microwave in room.they have all the facilities a swimming pool, breakfast and a car rental service in side the hotel.the best thing i found was that they donot charge a resort fee other wise most hotels charge. The hotel is best situated about 3-4 min walk to the metro station which makes the place accessible to all attractions in LA about 2-3 stations away from the hollywood highland where you have walk of fame,madam Tussads etc.and another 1-2 stations away is universal studios. A super market close by which will give you discount being the hotel guest! A good experience overall...i would also like to mention Cecile she is a great lady at the front desk;4
Great service from the minute we walked in the lobby. Friendly staff and very helpful in directing you to destination. Room was clean and bright with an excellent view from the 37th floor. Love the art deco look of the hotel. Convenient to Madison Square Garden and Peen station, Macy's and restaurants. Will stay there again. Recommend.;4
"We just stayed in room 1124 at the Empire hotel. We were seeing an opera at the Met Opera; 50 feet away. Wonderful service at check in, fabulous room, great views, spacious, comfortable room. A delight. Wish the city was slightly quieter but that canât be helped.";4
Well, donât over look this slightly tarnished gem. Rooms are small but adequate as a place to sleep, shower, and enjoy the city.  Convent to public transportation and airport buses.  Lots of OK places to eat and easy to get to and from.;4
We went to L:A in early March 2015 for a weekend Get-A-Way! We selected this hotel based on price and location. We made the right decision. We were pleasantly surprised that the rooms were remodeled and had a refrigerator and microwave in the room. We did not spend much time in our room because we went sightseeing everyday, but we would have been very comfortable spending time in the room. Complimentarybreakfast was offered daily with an Omelette Station. It was yummy:). Hugo was one of the cooks. He was friendly and very helpful. There was nightly entertainment i.e., comedy show, music, etc. I must add that this hotel is located right on a busy street. Therefore, it can be a little noisy. It worked for us because we did not spend a lot of time at the hotel, because we were out;4
I wanted to take my two daughters (aged 10 and 6) to see some of the main sites in NYC (eg, Statue of Liberty, MOMA, Brooklyn Bridge) on a budget. The Hotel Riverside Studios met my needs almost perfectly. The shared bathrooms were marginally inconvenient in that I don't like my daughters being unsupervised in a strange place. However, the rooms were clean, the TV worked, and it was easy to get around Manhattan from the hotel. In addition, there were two decent cafes a couple of blocks away that served good food, and a Barnes & Noble in walking distance down by the Lincoln Center. I'd go back again with pleasure, at the price I paid for a Manhattan room. I might not stay in summer, though. I imagine the rooms might get hot during a warm spell.;4
Was already familiar with the neighborhood (as familiar as one can be with NYC after 4 years away), so I knew this was where I wanted to stay.  Very limited lodging options in this neck of the woods, but I fully recommend it to get a true local experience.  No sign out front in this quiet (again, relative), residential street.  As others have noted, a safe area, but don't be careless.  Clean and basic, felt like a dormitory almost.  Myself and two buddies got a standard triple room with one full and one single bed.  Tight quarters for 3 grown men, but it wasn't awful.  Reasonable closet space, dresser, fridge, small tv hanging from the ceiling.  Fresh towels and soap daily, beds made up.  Did not have a private bath, but rarely had to wait to use the one on our floor.  Kitchen;4
"This is the third time a school trip has visited NY and this is by far the best hotel. Great location, handy for Times Square, the subway, Central Park, ESB and food outlets. Excellent rooms of superb quality. Very helpful staff. Buffet breakfast is the only disappointment as it is rather low key and ""fast food"" like.";4
I love the location, it is the closest to Universal Studios and City Walk. I think that just the extra couple  blocks of steps up hill to get to City Walk and the park would disuade one from staying at the  Neighboring Sheriton. Since Hilton is so close we had no qualms about going back to the hotel to allow our little one to nap while Dad & our preteen swam in the pool. Then we would head back out for late afternoon at the park, and even back to hotel and back out to City Walk for the evening.  The pool is large heated and has cabana tents, food and drink service .   I love that they have a little convienence refrigerator in the room   We stayed at the hotel a couple years ago and spent the big bucks to get a tower room one of the special the top floors with view of Universal;4
We chose the Empire Hotel based on a combination of price and location. The proximity to Central Park and Fifth Avenue shops is brilliant, within easy walking distance of the main sights. It is also near the Columbus Circle subway for access to elsewhere in the city. I was disappointed by some things in the hotel though. The window in our room did not lock and therefore rattled in high wind, it also meant that the temperature in the room was not the warmest as we were there in the cold of February. The door to the room was also rattley when our neighbours let their doors shut behind them. We ended up wedging the door with the room service booklet! We were also disappointed by the shower which we noticed to be a little loose and therefore did not stick at the desired temperature;4
3 nights in this hotel. Sincerely, I am happy. Everything was good. Ask a room on the patio: very quiet. I recommend also because the Subway red line is very closed: direct to Hollywood in 10 minutes, and also Universal in 15 minutes. it is great. the welcome is good, swimming pool pleasant, they like foreigners, and they propose airport shuttle service.;4
Location: great location, right at Penn Station which was great as we got Long Island train from airport! Loads of places to eat near by and close to most sightseeing bus routes.   Cleanliness: I felt hotel was spotless, lifts, hallways, corridors and room were clean and maid service every day.   Hotel: hotel clean and well kept, has a bar and restaurant - was only here 3 days so never used any of the facilities. Only fault was there was no information booklet in room so had to google check out times etc.   Staff: staff all attentive... I would like to take this time to mention one in particular... after a long LONG day of travelling (Glasgow to Edinburgh... Edinburgh to london... london to NYC...) my 10 year old daughter was really struggling as we had been up for almost 20;4
We went to New York for a wedding, on arrival it is very dark.. and dated.. and yes the rooms are very very small, but you get what you pay for.. (basic room in a great location) there was just enough room to walk around a queen bed (bit bigger than a double!) and only a small area for hanging clothes.. if you need a bigger room request it when you book.. it is worth it. We moved to a bigger room (but the air conditioning was a bit dodgy) the staff/cleaner (6th floor) were great and all tried the best to sort it out, also the keys do deactivate constantly.. (try not to put them with your credit cards â someone said this deactivates them! I loved the roof top, we had breakfast there â very nice, did not go swimming though â pool is small but in New York, you donât really have;4
I was in NY for 3 days and the Jane hotel is my favorite! If you dont mind shared bathroom and very small Room, its perfect! Very good prices for Manhattan .the staff is welcoming and always ready to help you.  The area is full of good restaurants, bars ,galleries, beside the great Whitney Museum. And very Near the entrance for the High Line.  Its Ã  40minutes enjoyable walk to Times Square !;4
Very friendly people at the reception, good beds, very nice breakfasy!   Only thing: if you have a room at the side of the street, you will have a lot of noise!  Also the neighbourhood is not so nice but I have nothing bad to say about the hotel!!;4
After flying from Sydney Australia and going straight to the hotel we arrived at approx 10am, well before check in but we were very happy that they had a room ready and were happy for us to check in. this is where we had our only issue. we get to the room and try the key a couple of times but its no good so we head back down to the front desk and they give us new keys and we start again. Back to the room same problem only this time someone opens the door as they are staying in there. Call the desk from the phone in the hall and they say to come back down as the room was meant to be vacant and they are sending security to the room. The front desk man was very apologetic and escorted us to a new room and gave us free breakfast for the few days we were there. We finally got a room;4
The location of the New Yorker is great - lots to do around and very easily accessible from the train or subway. The staff was friendly and did a good job securing the hotel, as you needed a key to even enter the elevator lobby. While the room was small, you can't ask for much more in a downtown hotel. The bed was comfortable, the AC was great, it was quiet and the curtains kept the room dark in the daylight. The bathroom was a bit outdated and ventilation was poor but the water pressure was great. Will definitely stay here again.;4
This hotel is conveniently located in the middle of Manhattan.  It is very close to Penn Station so if you are arriving by train, you can save the cab fare and walk the one block to the hotel.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  If your room is not ready, they will store your bags for free.  At the end of your trip after checking out, there is a $2.00 fee per bag to store them.  The rooms are small, but so are most rooms in NYC.  The bathroom sinks are ridiculously shallow so be careful not to get splashed when you turn on the water.  There are no room refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms or lobby and no complimentary breakfast, but the room rate was fairly reasonable for Manhattan.  There are plenty of dining options near the hotel.  The location is within a mile;4
My husband and I stayed for 6 nights in July on the 34th floor. Rooms were small but fine for sleeping. Cleaning crew were fine and come around early so be sure to put out the DND sign if you can find one. Extra towels are a must and tips help you get them. Had rusty looking water twice come out of tap in bathroom so let it runall good before brushing teeth. Great Restaurant in hotel, and elevators are fast with not alot of waiting. Security guards are good and look for room keys almost all the time to gain entry on the elevators. Great view of MSG, and two minutes walk from Penn Station, and MSG. Take Subway system alot, and don't fall for someone trying to sell you a weeks pass to ride the subway for $3, as I fell for it and the first time I tried it the pass didn't work,;4
Good value and well located. I have stayed in many different hotels in NYC while traveling activitely to NYC for almost 25 years. For sub $300/night, itâs a good value as many more expensive hotels do not provide any more in terms of room size or location;4
"The Empire is literally across the street from Lincoln Center - a 60 second walk. The ambiance is great, the room was quiet - even on a lower floor - and the staff was attentive . Lobby bar is fantastic for a quick (or slow) drink or two; quiet enough for a conversation. Had a junior suite; very roomy by NYC standards. Front desk staff was friendly and attentive.  The bellman remembered us from the night before. You can find better deals in NYC, so look elsewhere if price is your main objective. (Paid about $550 for the night, including all taxes.) But this is a very nice hotel and the access for Lincoln Center is amazing.   Three small quibbles:  1) On arrival, two bellman were standing at the door, speaking to each other, while three cabs were unloading without their";4
Nice location for uber to Universal, Warner Brothers and other locations. The rooms are incredibly quite. No microwave in room. No water filtration/bottle refill station.  Minimal places are walkable from this location.There is are food options, limited room service and an onsite bar.  There is an onsite gift shop for clothing, gifts and other items.;4
The bad:The room is super super small. Like, the foot of the bed is a foot or less away from the wall. Since we were only there to sleep, it was fine. The bathroom is super tiny, the sink is next to the bed, there is NO space for storage, no place to put the suitcases, not even where to place your toothbrush. There is no elevator. Good: It's very clean, The bed is super comfy, we were on the 4th floor so noise wasn't bad. The hotel is a block away from Penn Station so the location is amazing and you can move everywhere from there. The staff is very friendly and helpful. On our first day they recommended a place to have breakfast around the corner. We ended up having breakfast there every day.  Suggestion: There is a lot the hotel can do to help with storage. Instead of a normal;4
Stayed here for 3 nights from 27 Dec 11.  We had only booked a basic room but were upgraded by the hotel on arrival.  Check in was very smooth and staff were friendly.  I expected the rooms to be small but it was better than expected.  The bathroom is very small though!  The room was cleaned daily  The air con isn't very modern and although it was cold outside we just couldn't seen to cool our room.  The bed was very comfortable. The hotel is in a good location just near Central Park.  Overall, a nice hotel and would deifinitely recommend.;4
I went to New York for the first time by myself back in January, and wanted a hotel that was safe to stay in but in a good location as well so i didn't have to travel as far. Wyndham was by far the best choice i could have made, i arrived really late and i got a free upgrade which was amazing! It was so close to madison square garden and heaps of food places which was really convenient! So close the penn st station which made it so easy to travel places. Shopping was a breeze, as it was literally a 5 minute walk to VS, Macys, and then a further 5 minutes to times square. Best location, best customer service! I got stuck in that crazy blizzard and as i was by myself i was quite scared. The hotel staff went out of their way to let me use their phones to call my transfer service,;4
This is a great hotel for family and or business I stayed there for a conference a couple weeks ago. I would definitely recommend this if you can stay for more than two days because it's nearby Hollywood and the San Fernando valley. The elevators are very slow and that's the only complaint.;4
It was a pleasure to stay in this hotel. Everything was very clean. The bed was snow white and very clean bathroom. A little bit noisy in the corridor and I could not open the window to get some air to the room, but it was not a big deal. So I would recomend this hotel for sure!;4
The room did not have a mini fridge or microwave. Room was clean but very small/cozy. Hotel is close to nearby public transportation and eateries. The young lady at the front desk who checked me in wasn't that friendly.;4
We stayed at The New Yorker Thanksgiving Week.  We have passed this hotel many times and we finally decided to book it.  I am glad we did, the service is top notch.    Kudos to Jessica and Linda at the front desk, both of them were exceptional in helping us check in.  There were some issues but it was not their fault.  We decided to upgrade to get a fabulous view of the Empire State Building and a view of Madison Square Garden.  The room was spacious only downside was the bathroom.  It was very small and you had to be careful with the sink because water would just spray out if you lifted the handle to high.  Nothing major, you learned to deal with it.   Location was awesome, walking distance to Macyâs, Target, Kmart and many more stores.  McDonalds and a pizza place was across;4
We stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Universal Studios. It was perfect. We could just walk over to the park. It was uphill but a quick walk. The hotel itself was clean and modern. The staff in the lobby bar were terrific. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet, Note, we usually upgrade to a club room to have access to the lounge. This hotel does not have one. You just get passes to the buffet. It was huge, lots of selection. My only gripe about the hotel was that the pool was freezing and there was no policing. There were kids doing cannonballs into the hot tub while we were trying to relax.  If the goal was to be close to the theme park, we would stay here again.;4
Nice location, good staff. Some rooms with a view problem, but okay, if you look for silence nights without sirens on the street. The rooftop terrace bar and pool area, very good vibe there! happy to visit there again.;4
I spent 2 nights here for my 25th as I was going Universal VIP film tour, so this seemed the perfect place to spend it, and walk to the park. They gave me a nice view overlooking Universal and city walk, so we could see when they performed Waterworld (smoke and flames shooting up towards the sky) was really nice.   I would of gave this higher if it had not been for the following: Paying $48's for parking both days (I already knew this, but seems crazy when you're spending a lot to stay and they want yet more money out of you, yet motels do not charge?)  I felt a bit looked down on when checking in by a woman at front desk, however when they found out it was my birthday on the 2nd May, they gave me free entry to Infusion, and if we had any problems to call them (I cannot remember;4
We stayed at the Hilton for 2 nights as part of our California fly drive holiday. We arrived at the hotel early and we were able to pre book into the hotel, store my luggage and they advised me when the room (16th floor) was ready they would text me. We went up to Universal City (10min walk) and had some lunch arriving back at the hotel around 3:50, as check-in was 4pm, I went back to the desk to enquire if the room was available - different check-in staff - they said, sorry not yet should be only 15-20mins. I decided to wait in the lobby which is very pleasant area. 45mins later I went back up to reception and was told, sorry the room is still not ready, have a seat and they would find out what was wrong and come and get me. A further 10mins before a member of staff came over,;4
Very nice, spacious lobby with modern decor and 2 kinds of citrus water were waiting for us. The elevators were nicely appointed as was the lobby.  Rooms are chic and mod, whcih helps defray their small size. No desk in the room, but a nice table with 2 swivel chairs. Fridge and coffee maker, no micro. No light over the dresser, but interesting lights throughout the room.  Small, awkward bathroom, with the door in the way, and the switch behind the door. I was constantly hitting the door/shower glass going in or out. Water pressure was light, but there were 2 shower heads.  Sweeping airport views on upper floors with very little airport sounds. Nice workout room on the 13th (top) floor.;4
The location of this hotel is really what sells it to be honest, just by Penn Station and Madison Square Garden as well as a very short walk to the Empire State Building and Times Square... perfect! The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, from the reception staff, security and cleaners. We made the mistake of paying to upgrade to a river view room which consisted of us having to crane our neck at the corner window to see a glimpse of the Hudson, certainly not worth the additional cost but you live and learn! The room itself was very stylish and modern, clean and tidy, lovely and warm after the chilly January nights with plenty of plug sockets (always necessary for the phones and battery packs). It was a shame to have to pay for them to hold your luggage after check;4
On balance given four rating, though really felt more like 3.5. Suspect this was the bees knees in it's hay day, but a little worn at the edges now. Perfectly clean and comfortable however, and excellently situated for exploring NY on our 3 night stay. Paid up front via travel agent as part of longer trip, so was a bit peeved to be presented with a supplementaryâ bill on departure for $30 for use of the business centre whatever that is, the spa which we did not use, and the internet which we did!  Perhaps this is usual in US? Trattoria adjoining is very good.;4
After booking hotel and reading all the reviews was really worried about staying here, as was just myself and my teenage daughter, but was great stay, was nice and quiet area, but easy to get to main areas on the fast trains, staff were really helpful whenever we spoke to them and would say hello if we saw them around the hotel, concierge was really helpful. Are room was really roomy, air con was cold, so that was good, Had a 42 inch flat screen TV and it did work, just we didn't use it as wasn't there to watch TV. We needed a fridge for medical supplies and it arrived about 5 minutes after we arrived in our room and it was 11pm. Wished we had realised there was a 24 hour supermarket up the road sooner as saved us some money and had some nice food. Was plenty of places to eat;4
I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my husband and 13 yr old son, staff were lovely & helpful, rooms were a bit dated, but serviced daily. It's close to the Metro (500 metres from station) which takes u nth to Hollywood and Universal city and sth to LA city..easy to get around on. We had cooked Breakie included..they make eggs how u like.. Scrambled, streamed, fried, or omelettes plus waffles..made fresh as u wait..parking $22 per night..all in all good value.;4
The staff was always nice to us. Ready to answer questions and explain how to go somewhere we wanted to go. The room was good for us. The bathroom had some details to get renewed. The pool was clean. The sauna was fine, once it's heated. The sauna- shower is not practical. Needs to keep been pushed to work and no warm shower afterwards and room to rest. I would have liked to have a bathrobe. Breakfast very good, only little selection of Teas.;4
Arrived late (1.00AM) after delays at Heathrow. Only room left was a room with a broken loo. As a HH member asked for an upgrade and got a suite on the top floor.  Breakfast was good and overall service was good too.  Not the cheapest place to stay for 1 night but pretty good.;4
A surprisingly delightful stay with an old hotel that still has some elegance in her. Really enjoyed the decor, the rooftop patio, the views, and the staff.  If youâre tired of the Westins and Marriotts, try the Empire for something memorable;4
The lobby is nice. Very busy. The room was OK but the bathroom needed maintenance. Old fixtures were OK but walls and tile need work. TV picture quality was poor, so don't bother. Nice view of city. Price was competitive. Very convenient location to trains. Walk to times square or hop subway to Greenwich Village. No bad odors. Hallways nice.;4
The hotel is inside a compound with gates that open and close which is nice with all the homeless people in Hollywood. It is a mile or two from Hollywood and Vine and the Highland Center. There really isn't anything close to the hotel. No restaurants or attractions so plan to take a tour, taxi or drive. The hotel staff is accommodating and Jose and Hugo cook a fabulous breakfast daily which is included in the cost of the room. The hotel is under renovation and the rooms that are finished are impressive. The hotel is clean and people are always working on the tropical garden area. If noise is an issue, ask for a room on the back side or interior courtyard. The traffic on Vermont can be really loud on Friday or Saturday nights. Overall, I would stay again. Rooms are a little;4
This is the closest hotel to Universal Studios, just steps away. Rooms are upscale, clean, comfortable. Breakfast prices are outrageous, it's far better to enter the parks and eat breakfast there. FYI our room had a fridge but no microwave.  Room cost less than I expected (under $200) considering the proximity to Universal Studios. Overall, very good value.;4
Staid in hotel for Universal Studios trip. Very clean and great location. Very nice rooms and helpful staff. Only downside is you have to buy breakfast every morning. Location is very good and easy to go to universal studios and city walk.;4
I have been here for several work events.  From the sleeping rooms to the meeting rooms, the experiences have been good,  Next time, I hope to enjoy the rooftop lounge!  The front desk and concierge has been helpful  The only thing I do wish could be shifted is having a more reasonable price for breakfast.  We had to go to The Smith to have a reasonable warm  breakfast.;4
I booked this hotel because of the price but with serious reservations because of the negative feedback I had read in some reviews about bedbugs, noise from the bar downstairs, unhelpful staff, too hot/cold, etc. Well, after five nights in total (three before leaving for a trip to Central America and two on my return), I was much happier with my stay than I had expected. Yes, the room was possibly the smallest I have stayed in, but it was perfectly comfortable and I was frankly amazed at what they managed to pack into it, including a flatscreen TV, a safe (under the bed!), an selfset alarm, wall mirror, hooks for hanging stuff, etc. Never had problems with bedbugs to my great relief. And there were little thoughtful touches like the constantly refilled flasks of drinking water;4
Stayed over after a concert at MSG. Perfect location, just across the street. Make sure to book a remodeled room.;4
Stayed at the Empire with my wife and two very young children. I was on business. From the guy who took my car to the bell man to Lila at the front desk they went beyond the call of duty to help us. Definitely a place to stay for me with our kids when on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.;4
Can't get a better deal in manhattan. The rooms are adequate, small and can get noisy, but are fine. This is a great way to stay in the city without paying exorbitant rates.;4
Great hotel, staff are so polite and always helpful.  Cannot wait to stay here again, this hotel wonât disappoint you.  The location is amazing right outside Madison Square Gardens perfect location for those travelling to New York for the first time.;4
My wife and I come to our home state of California a few times a year. We especially like to visit in October for all the various Halloween events, Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios, Dark Harbor at The Queen Mary etc. etc. This is our second time staying at this hotel because of its close proximity to Universal Studios and Citywalk. We can just walk on over to the park whenever we like. We chose a room with a king size bed. Our room was on the 17th floor # 1773. There is valet and self parking available. Self park is in a garage below the hotel. The fee is $28 a night. A little high but not ridiculous. Honestly, its the only negative I have about the hotel. Check in was a breeze and our room had the amenities we enjoy, mainly a refrigerator. A coffee maker was in the;4
A good hotel with reasonable rooms at a reasonable price. You stay here BECAUSE it is very near to Universal City, in fact you can walk in ten mins but there is a bus for the lazy.   I did not eat the Hotel food, which may be a little overpiced, but there is plenty of options at Universal.   No complaints - ideal for the purpose.;4
The Empire Hotel is at a great location in Lincoln Center.  Not as hectic as Times Square but easy access to everything in the city.  Rooms are nice.  Make sure you check the size as some rooms are  small.  The Chowder House at the hotel is very good.  We visit several times a year.;4
I was a bit sceptical when I read some of the reviews for this place.  But I have to say I found it very decent for the price and the location was great!  The only downside is not having any private bathrooms but the shared ones were kept clean and the bedrooms were nice and clean too.  I'd highly recommend it for people wanting to have a cheap stay in New York and spend the rest of their money on shopping and having a good time!;4
Stayed here for 3 nights in an executive room, it was on a corner and we overlooked universal studios.  Great view and room but beware of what appears to be complimentary bottled water in the room! It wasn't obvious that it was chargeable which we had just spent 2 weeks in another hotel where it wasn't, so maybe it was complacency on our part.  But having drank a small and large bottle we were then charged $15 plus tax, and even though we hadn't finished the bigger bottle only drank about 1/3 when we came back that afternoon it had gone!  But if you want a really nice relaxing room you can't fault it.;4
I really enjoyed the three nights I spent at the New Yorker. I was in town for work, so while I didn't do any sightseeing, it's in a great location to enjoy the city. While the rooms were small (as I had expected) they were clean and comfortable. I would stay here again.;4
The Jane Hotel  I was encouraged by the overall positive reviews about The Jane on Trip Advisor, and after a look at The Jane's beautifully designed and eccentric web site, I decided to book three nights through lastminute.com for $99/Â£60 a night. I knew from reading the negative reviews that space in the single cabin might be an issue so I wasn't surprised by small dimensions of the single cabin room.   What I was surprised about was how clever the design of the cabin is. True, there is only a single bed and definitely not enough room to swing a cat (why would anyone swing a cat?! How cruel!) but the space beneath the first half of the bunk had a large hold-all for a suitcase, and the second half underneath the bunk had two large drawers on top of one another.   The other;4
We stayed 6 nights in the hotel, the period was during the storm Sandy. We had no idea what to expert, but the hotel gave us good information what to do. They had a list with restaurants who were open.  When we arrived also Ã  lot of information was given what to do where.;4
"We chose this hotel so we could be close to Universal. Huge hotel. Make sure you allow 20 minutes to get up to your room and back again - the elevators were SO slow it was ridiculous. The hotel was extremely busy and we had dinner at the bar one night because we couldn't get a table - which turned out fine as the barmen were great company and we enjoyed ourselves. The rooms are pretty standard with a ""beautiful view"" of Universal studios. The shuttles to and from Universal citywalk and Universal Studios were good value. We didn't realise we were quite close to a train station and a few casual restaurants cos we were perched on the top of a hill so it was good to venture down the hill to the ""real"" part of town. It did the job. Very expensive for what it was - a typical hotel";4
When checking-in there was a problem with our booking....it appeared they had not received confirmation from our travel agent....this took a while to sort out but they were apologetic and to be fair, it was not their fault. Eventually sorted and we were very pleased with our room. Hotel is in a great location for all the attractions and a great breakfast is served in diner at hotel. They charge you 5 dollars for each bag you want stored as you cannot have room key until 4pm.;4
Staff and hotel was great. Great location, friendly and efficient staff.  my only concern is size of room, very small . I stayed for daughter mother mini vacation and  moving out of college for summer.  Close to university.;4
Just got back from staying at this hotel room was lovely. Jeff the doorman was really helpful and Javier the bartender was a ð . Would definitely go back.location is perfect  but away from noise. Excellent bar next door;4
We found the hotel convenient as we picked it to be close to the Kaiser hospital to be with a family member facing major surgery. Between visits we were able to visit LA by jumping on the Metro and head just about anywhere. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was an excellent start to the day, and the staff was friendly and helpful .    The room was comfortable and clean, except for not being a fan of feather pillows and plumbing noise . We enjoyed our stay and were able to walk or take the Metro anywhere we needed to go. The weather was too cool to try the pool but it looked very nice .   Yes we would stay there again !;4
Staff well trained and courteous.  Pool setting quite nice.  Beds/linens/ comforters of high quality.  Room service spotty.  Evening not so great but breakfast very good.  Location of hotel excellent.  Beautiful view from our room at night.;4
great location for what I wanted to do -- Broadway, Met Museum, Met Opera.  Beds too soft, noisy even on 10 th floor from 54th Street -- single pane glass windows.  It was nice that windows opened as heat even when turned off was too much for late November.  Hotel staff was nice and helpful.  Hotel itself was in good but not great condition.;4
Nice hotel and really trendy.  Nice clean bedrooms which suited our needs. Located close to Central Park and a short walk to Times Square.  Unfortunately when we visited the Chowder restaurant was closed but thankfully a load of good restaurants in close proximity.;4
The location for visiting my daughter was perfect...also great setting right across from Lincoln Center and a nice small park in front of the hotel...rooms were small, but clean...my biggest complaints...no coffee in room and no free internet in the room....maybe those are upgrades;4
Excellent location near Lincoln Center, trains, Columbus Circle, Central Park.  Excellent concierge, Chris.  He secured excellent same-day seats for our desired Broadway show, made excellent restaurant recs, and was very friendly and professional.  Housekeeping was somewhat lacking, in that routine items weren't replenished as they should have been I.e, coffee, towels, condiments, etc.  even after calling housekeeping a few times.  Very clean room, and spacious.  Would I stay here again?  Yes.;4
Visited NYC for 3 days last week with my family including my 87 year old mother. After a 12 hour trip we arrived at the hotel around 10am but check in time was not until 4pm. We intended to drop our bags off and sight see until check in time but my mother was very tired. The front desk person Mohammed was very compassionate and understanding. He allowed us to check in right away- without charging the early check in fee-because of my mother. He also provided us with an upgraded room with a view. It was a wonderful reception after such a tiring journey. Thank you Mohammed for caring you are a good ambassador  for this hotel. My family especially my mother are very appreciative.;4
The Empire is relatively large and affordable by Manhattan standards.  The staff are efficient, though not overly friendly.  The rooms, lobby and hallways are clean.  More important, the rooms are larger than expected.  I would only warn guests that the coffee is NOT complimentary.  The location is outstanding as it is near Lincoln Center, the UWS, and a subway which allows you to get around the entire city.;4
My daughter and I shared a room on the 4th floor with two double beds. Our room faced a courtyard, so we kept the room darkening shade down most of the time, but at least that meant we didnât have street noise. We slept quite well except for the first night when the alarm clock set by a previous guest started blaring. We were surprised to discover that the refrigerator had a lock on it, but thankfully the front desk sent someone up to unlock it. Also, the tv didnât work, so the front desk sent someone else up and they reset it. The room was very small, but the bathroom with a rain shower was fine. The Ameritania staff was very kind and helpful. It was nice to have cold water in the lobby.;4
We all love NYC... and in my opinion, a hotel should act as an Oasis from the constant noise and hectic. The Empire is good value for money and has a very friendly staff... However, loud afternoon DJ's on the rooftop can deter from the need for piece. Having said that, the hotel is overall great for $199 or so. Super location right next to Lincoln Sq. Enjoy!;4
I was travelling alone to attend the Women in the World Conference at Lincoln Centre. The Empire Hotel was situated perfectly for the conference. The room, while small which was expected, was very nicely decorated and clean. Bathroom was small and didn't leave much room to move around, plus the shower was one pane of glass with a large opening that felt kind of odd. Worked fine though with lots of hot water and was clean which is most important. The bar and lobby were popular places. I went to the Rooftop bar which was very cool. Great vibe, lots of people there enjoying after work drinks. Had a martini which was average, but the service was decent.  Overall, the hotel is very hip, well located for my needs, and clean. Will definitely return.;4
"I stayed here 2 nights in December 2011. The location is great (best attraction: 2 short blocks from Central Park for great morning runs). The room (""Deluxe king"" -- I think that this means a standard room) was postage-stamp sized -- not enough room to actually stand in front of the sink (you sort of have to straddle the commode to wash your face), and predictable toe-stubs on the bed if you try to walk from one side of the room to the other. I was on the second floor, and predictably there was street noise through the night. (Hint: run the air conditioner to add some white noise and drown out the street.) I'll also never understand why hotels have shower stall with no doors, so that they can count on flooded bathroom floors every morning in every room. But the desk staff were";4
We had a top notch, well-appointed room for one night at this hotel.  It was quiet, comfortable and very relaxing.  The hotel is located close to Penn Station and good parking garages.  Access to the Lincoln Tunnel is also excellent.  There is a great diner restaurant and a superb Italian restaurant off the main lobby.  Can't be beat!!;4
We stayed on 10th floor and it was very quiet. Staffs (especially doormen) were very friendly and helpful. Public areas were clean. The location is perfect as you are near to NQRW, 1, E lines.  However sometimes the room was not made and the clock in my room didn't work.;4
We recently stayed at The New Yorker for 5 nights and found it to be clean and comfortable. The location is great for MSG, Times Square, Penn Station and Empire State. There are plenty of places to eat near the hotel at a reasonable price. The hotel is approximately a 10 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway. In the morning the hotel has a take out breakfast stand which is very popular, although we didnât eat here so canât comment on the quality or price but, the queues spoke for themselves. The only issue is with the lifts in the hotel. They take a very long time to arrive and often when they do arrive theyâre too full to even try to squeeze into, resulting in a further wait. One day, some of our party, who were staying on the 28th floor, waited 15 minutes for a lift to;4
Was really surprised at finding such an elegant hotel off the beaten path in Hollywood.  High ceilings, marble bath and tile showers, excellent beds and fine breakfast.  It doesn't have a restaurant other than the breakfast service, but you can fill up on the many breakfast offerings for the whole day!  It has a microwave and a fridge as well as an indoor sitting area with gardens and palm trees - really beautiful.  They could have a place to hang towels or robes, and the noise from the light in the bathroom is pretty annoying, but we'll definitely return!;4
I love this hotel! The lobby is a beautiful art-deco style and the rooms are nicely decorated. The beds and linens are very comfortable. The bathroom is a little dated, but the shower' s water pressure blew me away! Our view from the room was magnificent ..... we had a direct view to the Empire Stare Building. The hotel has a 24 hour diner in the lobby, which is a great convenience and the food is really good.;4
The queen room was cosy, but how much time do you spend there? The important thing is location: right across from Lincoln Center, where our group was attending several operas. It was not fancy, but more than adequate, and a good choice for our group.;4
The New Yorker proved to be a nice stay. Itâs not a 4 star hotel, but for the price it offers a great location with instant access to The subway. The staff was excellent and bent over to take care of us.;4
Location very convenient.  Love that I could check in early.  Rooms are a little dated but I was able to upgrade to a suite.  Not the suite I was promised (I requested and was promised a terrace - they even emailed me a picture) but I was happy with the room.;4
Generally a nice hotel in a great location. It is clean with good service but needs updating. All that said given the location I would stay here again especially if spending time at Lincoln Center going to opera, ballet, etc..;4
This hotel provided exactly what we wanted - to be near Lincoln Center where we were going to the theater and SAB. We did not want any frills - just basic provision of a clean place to stay - at a very reasonable price.;4
I stayed in the hotel 3 weeks. Very good hotel, not far from all sigthseengs.   Very good location from downtown, Hollywood blv, Santa Monica and much more places of interests.   Will stay here one more time!;4
Having been refused entry onto a flight at Los Angeles, we were forced to spend a night in LA at very short notice. We booked with the Hyatt and on arrival 30 minutes later, we were met with excellent US customer service and had our room upgraded when we told of our woes. The room was immaculate. We used the bar which had an excellent choice of wines. The following morning we used the hotel's shop to buy some very good quality breakfast foods. Free transfer to and from the airport.;4
The hotel itself was perfectly fine, though not especially fancy, and will be even better once the elevator upgrades are completed.  But I would suggest that after the elevator work is done, the hotel consider expanding the fitness center.  I was down there last week, Sunday through Wednesday, by 5:00 am and it was not unusual for all the machines to be taken by 5:30.  As seems typical in hotel fitness rooms, there was only one bike-type machine, which is my preferred workout and the reason I rushed down there every morning.  Overall, though, the hotel served its primary purpose, which was to put us within walking distance of Universal Studios.;4
First time in New York. This was in a perfect location for traveling to all the sights and surroundings were gorgeous. Rooms on the small side but what you'd expect from a boutique hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.;4
We always stay here when going to Lincoln Center or Columbus Circle area.  It's a decent place with good service.  No restaurant or food service and that's inconvenient, but plenty of quick coffee or good dining just steps from the front door.  Updated but small rooms.  We like it enough to return year after year.;4
The Hollywood Hotel was chosen after my colleague stayed there over last Christmas, we both agreed that the Hotel provided all the services needed, great staff service, good breakfasts and comfortable rooms. The location is good, easy transport to all of the attractions. Would definitely stay there again...;4
Stayed here for 4 nights and it suited our needs perfectly.it was basic but clean the staff were all friendly,nice neighborhood and close to the subway.rooms and bedding clean with beds made everday and clean towels.shared bathroom but we seemed to have it to ourselves and there was always hot water!;4
The hotel is conveniently located near Universal Studios and close walk to the Universal City metro station. The rooms were comfy, the staff were very friendly and the hotel is reasonably well priced for what you get.  The breakfast options are limited, but more than enough to kick start the day.  Overall, a good experience.;4
"My room was a Metro Room with a queen bed. I was a bit surprised that the room, itself, was so small, but it was reasonably priced for New York City, and I didn't plan to spend much time there but to sleep. The building is old, but very well maintained. My rating is four instead of five stars only because the TV reception and the wi-fi were a bit lacking, and the walls proved to be a bit thin when my ""neighbor"" chose to use the shower. That last, however, occurs even in the newest of buildings. In truth, 4 1/2 stars would be more fair.   The location cannot be beaten. It is basically kitty-corner from Madison Square Garden and just down the street from the Empire State Building and Macy's. I also ate a couple of meals at the Tick Tock diner in the lobby. The menu was extensive,";4
We stay at the Empire when we are going to Lincoln Center and it will be a late night. The location is excellent - near LIncoln Center, Columbus Circle, the Time Warner building and Central Park. We always appreciate the modern rooms/bathrooms, excellent bedding and friendly/helpful service.;4
Loved the view of the Empire State Building from our 35 floor room :) this hotel is steeped in history and has some beautiful Art Deco features. Room small but adequate. Was an excellent location for sights seeing, a few blocks from Empire State and Macy's, easy walking to Time Square too. Arrived on LIRR from JFK airport, easy and by far the quickest way to get to the hotel as Penn station is just around the corner. Don't forget to check out the independent restaurants on 9th Hells Kitchen.;4
Charming hotel, like the design and atmosphere! Centrally located. Rooms are designed beautifully. They should insulate the windows though, as the noise can be bad at times (due to traffic). Another disappointing thing is charging for wifi: this is so old fashioned. Just add this as a standard to your room.;4
We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights to end our USA trip. Our room was a king corner room with fold out sofa. Most rooms over the 10th floor would have great views, we were only on 7th and could see universal studios but only partially. Room was a good size and beds were comfortable. The bathroom did not have a bath but this did not bother us as we would not use anyway, the actual room was huge with lots of mirrors. The outside pool area was really nice and the pool was a good temperature. The hotel is a short 5 minute walk from Universal studios and the citywalk shops, which had different options for food and shopping. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel, thanks Hilton.;4
Hugo is the best chef that serves breakfast! Thank you so much for those great tastes Hugo! ðð¼ð´besides each room doesnt same so ask newly renovated rooms but anyw breakfast fixes everything! if i ever come to LA i would stay there if Hugo is here !;4
I stayed here during a recent business trip to New York City. The hotel is located in a great location. It is right next to Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building is located nearby. The hotel lobby was well laid out and you had to present your room key to security before you could get to the elevators. The elevators ran quickly and there was very little wait time on them. My room was good enough for my four night stay. The bathroom in my room could use a little updating. Overall it was a very good stay.;4
Tiny space but ok for us! Rooftop pool is small and inside, bar was closed. Shower had no door and bathroom door is awkward and doesn't fit the space. We liked it for a discount price, and the location can't be beat. Overall ok just small and no great room views.;4
"A nice hotel with a very good location. About 30 seconds away from Madison Square Garden, awesome view over the Empire state and around 15 minutes walk to Times Square!   We were four people and paid 134$ per night for a room with two queen-sized beds that were very comfy. The room wasn't that big, so we were a bit tight but it wasn't too bad. The bathroom was nice and clean and the showers very hot (nice). There was no breakfast included and the ""hotel breakfast place"", (right next door, connected to the actual hotel), was ok. The WiFi in the room was actually pretty good, so we didn't have to go down to the lobby for once. Overall a good stay, even though it has a few things that could be better!";4
This is a very nice hotel located across from Universal studios. it has great views of the park (on the park side rooms) great staff and a huge food buffet. food prices are a bit high. Great place to stay if you plan to visit Universal studios its close and you dont have to worry about parking;4
We stayed in May 2016 for 12 nights and we couldn't have picked a better base for our holiday. We arrived around 13:00 on the Sunday but check in was not until 15:00 so were able to leave our bags whilst we went for a drink. We didn't get in our room until around 15:30 so please be aware of this that you room might not be ready at 15:00 as over the course of our trip we saw several others waiting for their rooms to be ready after 15:00.   Our room itself was very spacious compared to what I was expecting for a hotel in New York, large double bed, desk, chest of drawers, tv, area to hang clothes and shower room with a really good powerful shower (once we worked out how to work it!!). Overall a really good room with plenty of room for a young couple. We didn't spend a lot of time;4
Overall, love this place. Our company had a fantastic experience working with the staff to host a conference.   Smack dab connected to Universal, City Walk, etc, this hotel is a tourist's paradise (especially if rental car and pricy parking are in your budget).   When you walk into this hotel, you may experience something similar to vertigo.  WHERE AM I?  I FEEL SO CONFUSED!  Is it 1989-because I thought it was 2013!? This hotel is almost two decades overdue for a major overhaul--especially in the conference space, and you'll notice this right away.  The rooms are completely average, but not as badly worn as the public/conference spaces. Really strange that they give you shampoo, conditioner, bar soap and mouthwash -- but no lotion.  Where's my darn lotion?   Otherwise: - Easy;4
The hostel is 5 mn walk away from the subway and not far from downtown where you can find many stores, restaurants  and bars. The guesthome were nice, the  room are very clean and very brighted. The  negative  view is about showers because you can't put  your clothes anywhere and these are mixted showers! I don't really agreed with that even there is video camera outside.;4
After reading the reviews, we nearly cancelled.  So glad we didn't.  Hotel was really good.  They reduced their price the week before we went, an email to the Manager and they changed my price to the new one - a saving of $45 a night.  Some of the front office staff were not as helpful as others - but worked out fine in the end.  Room was clean and tidy, with sliding door onto patio.  Breakfast was really good - breakfast cereal was nice and fresh, waffles freshly made whilst you wait.  Friendly breakfast lady.  Swimming pool area was great, with towels supplied.  Water was a bit cold.  Area around the hotel a bit dirty - but if you walked up to shops near Los Feliz (about 5 min walk) - nice Thai restaurant with friendly staff, Supermarket and Rite-Aid.  Easy access to Universal;4
The room with the view was on the 18th floor very nice and priced right as I used my AAA card for the best possible rate.  It is an older Hotel but the staff is exceptional and very attentive.  It was my first time staying at this Hotel for a couple of days with my Family as we enjoyed the shuttle service to Universal studios and its restaurants.  Don't forget... ask your discount at all Universal Studios shops and restaurants everything is a bit pricey.  The room was spacious and the view was spectacular and very lovely.  The beds are extremely comfortable with the extra touch of having fluffy soft pillows after a long day was even more special.  Everything was clean, decorative and convenient. A great place to stay when with your Family.  We will definitely be back to visit;4
It was a nice place. Can't get any closer to the subway. The showers go hot and cold and the free internet is only in the lobby. The information that I saw made us believe it was free hotel wide internet. The wifi in the lobby was ok to slow, speed wise.;4
I was going up for a special one-night-only experience - a memorial tribute to my old boss Paul Taylor at Lincoln Center. I had to be on a 6:00 am train, so needed to be in the Penn Station neighborhood. I stayed out even later than I expected to, sharing memories and drinks with friends and arrived at the desk to check in at 12:50 am. The lady was very nice and you would never have known how late it was.    My room was spotless,  the art was very nice, and the amenities were as promised.  A very comfortable bed. I did not have time to shower, so I can't speak to the water pressure, etc., but the staff was again very cordial when I left, about 4.5 hours later, making sure I knew which entrance was better for Amtrak vs NJ Transit. It's a very old-school place that made a great;4
good stay, nice room, nice staff, filthy tiles in bathroom shower. took photos and cleaned it myself, it came off very easily;4
Avery large room for a hotel in NYC.  Mattress needs to be updated and more lighting in room, but overall this is a great place to stay.  Very conveniently located.  5 min was to Central Park, 10 min walk to 30 Rock and 7 min walk to heart Of Times Square.  Staff was extremely helpful.;4
For what you pay it is good value. The room is small but it is a bed for the night. Toilets and showers are clean, there is free wifi. Phone reception for me was poor though. Cafe seems popular, but the bar was very dark and not very inviting. The staff all wear uniforms which look like they work on Disney's Tower of Terror ride.;4
Must visit the lobby bar and enjoy great cocktails from the 1st class beverage team. The lobby bar is awesome great place to realx and enjoy a nice drink and if hungry they have a small food bar menu to enjoy.;4
All staff were pleasant and helpful. I had reserved a room with two beds. At check-in, we were told it was a room with one bed and a pull out. I wasn't happy about that. Yet, when we went to the room it did have two beds! I was very happy about that. Weird that their computer wasn't telling them the right thing. The room was clean and spacious.;4
Free shuttle from and to the airport that is 700 m away. Bar and food service for the very tired and / or  no fuss  clients. However, if you wanted to have a nice meal while relaxing in a soft tone environment and confortable seats..that is not the place. We took a standard room which category is Â«Â  never available before the regular check-in time at 15:00 hrsÂ Â» unless you pay for it. Too bad. So, for a quick in and outnor if you are ready to pay for Uber or taxi for better environment while eating, itâs perfect.;4
I booked this hotel when it was a Quality for our 1st wedding anniversary. We didn't need a 4 star hotel as we both work in them, seeing New York was our aim.  It had changed to a Days Inn just before our stay and I can honestly say we never experienced any of the little problems or wear and tear that I read about in the reviews.   I was a little worried about the lifts, but following advise from previous reviews I stayed to the ones on the left hand side of reception and we were fine.  If you are looking for quality or service that you get in a 4 or 5 star hotel this is not the place for you, but if you only want a place to rest after a great days sight seeing this is a good place to stay.  The Key West Diner was great ( so much food) and the tube / underground is on the corner;4
I totally *LOVED* my stay at the Woogo Tempo Hotel!  1. The hotel itself is in an apartment building so you share the place with people who actually live there. Nothing wrong with that coz when you get in your room, you can pretend that you live in New York City! It has a little kitchen complete with pots, pans, kitchen utensils, plates etc. The room was clean and surprisingly quiet. We had a two- bedroom and both rooms are big enough. The bathroom is on the compact side but it's big enough to give you room to move around it. Just one hitch: bring your own towels. I think the towels provided were so old I just couldn't get myself to use them. Otherwise, everything was clean and usable. We didn't have a good view from our window, but that' okay. We didn't plan on staying all day;4
Came here with 2 kids while my husband was working in the city for a couple of days. Had a 2 queen bed room - definitely a tight squeeze for 4 people! Miniature bathroom - the door hit the edge of the toilet seat as it opened... But beds were comfortable and the shower was great. We didn't use anything from the mini bar as it was expensive and there was a shop next door to buy water etc. The kids swam in the pool - more like an oversized bathtub - but they had a great time and didn't care about it being very small. Location was great for access to central park and for getting down town.;4
This is a BEAUTIFUl hotel. You have to trek through a maze to find it, but once you're in, it's gorgeous paradise. There is a central fountain, tiers of the roof with pools and couches to lounge on and look at the city. The food is amazing, they have a free laundry service, the rooms are beautiful. My only criticism is that it's a little hard to get anywhere (you need a guide to get to the taxi stand) and it's probably one of the priciest places we've stayed. That said, we loved it and had an amazing time, felt totally safe, and they went above and beyond to make us comfortable. The dinner we had at the hotel was one of the best on our trip. Love it!;4
this was a good choice for one night. It was close to were i needed to go. The hotel was clean and everyone was friendly. Restaurants and Bakery are nearby as well as Lincoln Center. My only complaint is no in room coffee maker and no USB ports.;4
Room with queen size bed was super small - not much bigger than the bed. But I have to say the room did have all the essentials. Service was very good. Loved having the 24 hour diner connected to the hotel. Great location to Penn Station and subway.;4
Very hip & funky modern updates to this modern hotel.  We absolutely could not have asked for a better location, and the employees very pleasant and unobtrusive.  The bathrooms are tiny, but workable, and our room had a great view of Lincoln center, which is right across the street.  We went to NY to see a play, and I almost booked a hotel closer to the theater, but I am glad we didn't - we were so close to Central Park, and had a great time exploring it while we were there.  The theater was less than a mile, and it was an easy walk, with plenty to look at along the way.  Our room was quiet and comfortable, but as other reviewers stated, the rooftop bar is very loud on the weekends.  The rooftop is a real draw for 20 somethings - we went up to get a drink, and came right back;4
"We stayed here just last weekend - Labor Day - for a ""staycation"" in town.   (thank you Grandma for babysitting!!)   Checked in at 5 and immediately headed to the patio, where we were greeted by the lovely Mandy, who quickly served us glasses of wine, while we stuffed our plates full of olives, hummus, chips/salsa, cheese, and other fresh appetizers.  She refreshed them several times, and as we relaxed in the serene, comfortable Mediterranean like patio, we finally felt like a holiday!   The room/environs are clean, but nothing fancy, but the patio is truly lovely.    After a nice sleep, we awakened to breakfast (continued kindly until 10:30 am, to allow a nice sleep-in).  I had heard the breakfast was great, and this did not disappoint!  Made to order omelettes, muffins,";4
This is the first time I've rated a hotel favorably almost solely for the location, but here it is. What a fantastic spot right next to Penn Station. Staff were friendly although check-in/check-out was a bit arduous with a long wait. The reception area was lively at all times of day and the hotel is very easy the spot.  The room itself for Manhattan standards was acceptable, downsides including next to no counter space for toiletries in the bathroom, and everything was just a smidgen run down overall, from broken elevator indicators to worn carpeting/office chairs. Wifi was good/acceptable throughout our stay.  We had a view of the Empire State Building from our room (which was not quiet at all, but still within acceptable limits), so that was a welcome sight!  We would stay;4
I stayed at 'Days Inn' on 94th street in Broadway NY for three nights. We were given a clean and large room on the 12th floor. The bed was comfortable and there was lots of complimentary toiletries which were topped up each day (toothbrush, razor, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, shaving balm) and coffee, tea and water! :-)  The rates were good considering the location and there was a subway outside the hotel which makes it very easy to get to Times Square and other places in NY.   The lift in the hotel is very slow and the 12th floor is rather dark and gloomy and could be lit up more. However, I can't fault the service or the room and had a very pleasant stay in the heart of NY city!   Summary of good points:  - good room rates - wide range of toiletries which are topped up;4
Just stayed 3 nights at the Empire.  The room was a nice size and the bed was great, so was the shower.  The windows have not been updated and I thought the street noise would bother me, but it didn't. You might want to take ear plugs if you're a light sleeper and end up with a room facing the street.  The shower was excellent.  Only downside was the outrageous charges for everything extra - no free wifi in the room, a bottle of water in the room was $8 (had to hide the water so we didn't accidentally open one). But, that aside, the room was super comfortable and the location is great.;4
Sure the rooms are a bit run down and the carpet is worn.  But the price is very good and the staff was friendly and extra helpful. I stayed here 3 nights along with a friend. We each had our own room. My friend originally planned to only stay for 2 nights. When he requested to keep his room for a 3rd night, he learned the hotel was fully booked. But the nice woman at the front desk offered to upgrade my room to a suite where we both could stay. The suite was nothing special. It was a little larger with one bed and a couch with a pull out bed. But she did not charge us any extra for the upgrade. I donât know the history of the building but it is a nice older hotel with a lot of nice features.  The lobby is quite classy with a fire place and stone lions outside. For Manhattan,;4
me and my family had been planning the dream holiday to Hollywood everything looked perfect on the website but in reality the hotel was hard to find we drove past it like four times then we went for a dip in the pool well it was so cold that no one went in past there legs! but overall the room was amazing, friendly and welcoming also the hotel shop was well priced overall we would come back here!;4
"I stay here for business travel. It's a pretty good hotel. The rooms are larger than normal and the beds comfortable. The pillows are especially good. The bathrooms are large, modern, and better than the ones at the nearby Sheraton (which hsa slightly better bedrooms but is more expensive and lacks the great views.). The buffets here are good but expensive; it's worthwhile to walk across the street to the Citywalk (sp?), which boasts a large number of eateries. Avoid the coffee bar here, which serves substandard brew. The hotel's best feature is its staff; everyone I interacted with was surprisingly friendly and helpful.";4
My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend for one night.  I booked the room as part of a gift for him and was a little nervous because there are extremely mixed reviews about this hotel.  I went through with the reservation because the price was significantly cheaper than other hotels in the area and I am SO glad I did.  The hotel was not far from the hustle and bustle of central manhattan and was perfect for what we needed.  The room was extremely clean, newly remodeled and rennovated.  It was by no means spacious, but there was plenty of room comfortabley move around.  The cable was not so great but the last thing we stayed in the city for was to watch TV.   I would definately recommend staying here for a weekend getaway!;4
This was our first accomodation for our month long Europe trip, it was so affordable and less than a 5 minute walk from Hammersmith tube station which was perfect for us. Some nice local places to eat, especially the Hammersmith Ram. Few good shopping places around for the days you dont want to travel in to the city. Accomodation was very simple, very clean but honestly had everything you need when your travelling around. No complaints here.;4
Vi stayed at Ameritania for 9 nights. The location is perfect for visiting New York. The rooms are rather small, but okay if you are busy experiencing the city. The staff is very friendly and helpful - especially Majid.;4
This is an older hotel - art deco.  Has been renovated but still feels old.  Location is the best part - close to subway - close to Times Square and Hudson Yards. All in all, this was a good hotel for NYC.;4
Nice find! Rooms were recently renovated. Hotel was clean, rooms well appointed. Room service, restaurant, fitness center. Hotel staff very accommodating. Access to subway, Times Swuare & Broadway all walking distance. Would stay here again.;4
Very convenient location, right next door to London Eye. Consistent Premier Inn experience, I would personally skip the breakfast. It is good value but not really special. Rooms are spacious and clean, location is quiet despite being central.;4
I had a peaceful stay. The rooms are very clean and the beds are very comfortable. The staff are very accommodating and professional.  Great access to transportation and restaurants;4
As expected being in NY, the rooms were small. The room was clean and nice. My sink didn't drain very well, but that wasn't a problem. The staff in encountered was very nice and friendly. I only stayed one night and basically just slept there, but the trip was nice.;4
"A great Hilton in a convenient location. My experience was a quick check in. I had a wonderful large king room with spacious bath, beautifully decorated. The view from my 7th floor room was nice. Very comfortable bed. The breakfast buffet was excellent. A bit of a walk from self park to the lobby. The elevators are the slowest of any hotel I have ever stayed in. By the time the elevator arrives, there are so many people waiting that the elevator is packed making it uncomfortable, not to mention the poor people (like me) that had to wait another long while for another elevator many times. Terrible. If they could take care of this problem, then they might get an ""Excellent"" rating from me.";4
Hotel was clean and comfortable.  Centrally located with many things to do and great restaurants.  We didn't get to go to the rooftop bar, but heard it had a nice view.  Room service was not available the weekend September 29, 2018 because they were undergoing renovation.;4
Nice big busy hotel. Location is perfect for tourists. Macys 2 minutes walk to the left, Empire State building a further 5 minutes. Madison Sq Garden 2 minutes to the right. 10 minutes to Broadway. Great view of the ESB. Rooms very small, but ok if you are only staying for a few days.  Staff very helpful.;4
Checked into the hotel with a little trepidation having read some of the reviews mostly citing how small the rooms were check in went smoothly and we were given room 2222  on the 22nd floor opened  the door to find a very large spacious room with a view right onto the empire state building and below was maddison square gdn room was very clean and comfortable our friends had a similar room but a different view hotel was a great location for all the sights easy to get a cab to all locations penn st station just across the Rd  next to maddison which we used to go back to long island would definitely go back to the same hotel very friendly staff no problems at tall;4
Stayed here for a week with my friend. Location was ideal as we were mainly in LA to visit the theme park. Pool area was nice and clean and had a little pool bar outside. Hotel was a little bit dated, rooms could do with an upgrade and we got stuck in the lift a number of times while staying and couldn't find a staircase to use instead.  Would stay here again for the convenience of location.;4
This was a nice hotel however it was over priced for the days that we stayed, looking into staying at other times for the year and the price is $400.00 less on any given day. I felt that just took advantage of the weekend;4
"These accommodations are the most basic I could imagine.   The room is tiny.  So much so that the sink is in the room instead of the bathroom.   Sitting on the john, my feet were in the shower.    Bring you slippers; the floor was ice cold.    No closet, no thermostat, and NO ELEVATOR.    If you are in NYC for one night passing through, this is your place.   One block from Penn Station and Amtrak.   I had an 8th avenue facing room so the street noise was more than most.   If you are a light sleeper try to get one of the rooms facing 30th street instead (I had room 209).   All that being said, the room was clean and the bed comfortable.   Bathroom linens clean and plentiful.   Flat screen TV and free wifi.   Helpful staff and desk manned 24 hours.   My 5 AM wake up call came on";4
I love staying at the Empire Hotel mostly for its location as I usually go to Lincoln Center. The attendants are very kind at the front desk. I only had a problema with a reservation made by phone with the Blue Note which didn't work when I got to the club. I guess it might have been Blue Note's fault. The room I was in at this last stay wasn't so good. A bit noisy (732) and the bathrooms are too  small. The robes and towels were too much used. The beds and pillows are very confortable! Even so, I love staying at the Empire.;4
The staff was extremely helpful when we asked how to find our way around Manhattan.  I was impressed with the concierge service.  They seemed to know the neighborhood (we needed a flower shop).   The room was small but clean. I think ours had been recently updated.  Great location, close to theatre district and transportation (right next to Penn Station). From our point of view, it was a great location.  The only downside was the room size, but that was a minor issue.;4
Rooms are a good size with twin beds being double beds.  You have to ask for a coffee machine in the room but there is no charge for this facility, when requested, one was delivered to our room along with tea and coffee and paper mugs.  The machine made a decent cup of tea.  All staff very helpful and no one got access to hotel rooms without showing room cards so felt secure.  There are 2 restaurants to eat at, we eat at Tick Tock on our first night and it was reasonable. Hotel is in a great location for walking to most places of interest and is around the corner to Macey's.  It is also in a great location for Penn St station.  The down side to this hotel was a $22 dollar a night per room facility charge which was unexpected and came to Â£75 for our 4 night stay.  For this you;4
I stayed at the Jane last fall due to a friend's recommendation since I couldn't find a decent hotel under $400 (everything was booked and expensive due to a conference and fashion week).  I was apprehensive about the shared bathroom and small room since I was traveling for work but it was fine and only $99.  Sidebar: my co-workers stayed at a popular brand hotel that week for $400-$600 and ended up leaving due to bed bugs.   The room is very small (cruise ship like) but I wasn't in there much and I would work in the bistro downstairs anyway.  NOT a fan of shared bathrooms but they were extremely clean -  initially I was uncomfortable but then realized that everyone was in the same situation.  I did have a neighbor who lived in the hotel permanently (and has been there for;4
We stayed there from 7/23-27. Found it to be a great location. Walked two short blocks to Columbus Circle and took the subway to many parts of Manhattan as well as to Brooklyn Heights. Our room was small as are most NYC hotel rooms, but it was clean and quiet.We are going back in September and will probably stay there again.;4
We stayed there for 3 days, July 1-3 for attending NABC2016. The moment we reached at the hotel, we were greeted by the staff members present there and escorted to the elevator by them. Although the security was tight they did not bother us as long as we were able to show our badge and other documents. We felt safe in their presence. It was a wonderful experience staying in the New Yorker. Thanks a lot.;4
the hotel is very convenient to the to the subway ---just a few steps to the door of the hotel...starbucks is just across the street (but it is a small store but proficanet) about a 20 min walt to time square....or about 7$ Lift ride... Madison Square Garden is just steps away... the hotel is old and grand.... the lobby is new and refreshing... but the rooms do show their age with modern decor -very clean.  the shower water pressure could be a lot GREATER--but its ok.....there are 10 elevators (i think) and it can still get quite congested waiting on them (6 service the first 20 floors and the other 6 service the 20th thru 40th floors)  we were on the 40th floor in a suite that was comfortable with a separate siting area from the bed and bath and a TV in each room.   we could;4
Very convenient location surrounded by restaurants and transportation. We had a room on the 23rd floor, a little small but still very nice. They offer early check in and late check out for a small additional fee which was super convenient. Weâll be staying here again should we choose to come back to the city.;4
Hotel in excellent location. Service was great, however the hotel is old and is showing its age. I had the double suite and it was smaller than the pictures online show. I enjoyed my stay at Wyndham overall but next time I might choose a newer hotel with more room.;4
I spent one short stay of maybe only about 10 hours at the LAX Hyatt Regency (got in mid-evening and had to take an early flight out of LAX the next morning, but it was nice enough that I wish I could've stayed longer!  This is an attractive, luxurious hotel.  It's also a HUGE hotel, with quite a few floors and a LARGE number of rooms per floor, but it was easy to navigate one's way around.  The lobby, common areas, etc. were spacious, attractive, and plush.  I didn't have a chance to use the pool or other facilities, but my room overlooked the pool area and it looked very large and appealing.  The room was large and very comfortable, and everything seemed in excellent repair and was of upgraded quality.  Most Hyatt Regency properties are quite nice, but this was even nicer than;4
Was excited to find a reasonable priced hotel in New York in a lovely neighbourhood (the Meat Packing District) and on this basis this hotel delivered. The rooms are small but perfectly formed for one!  However, like the other reviewers I found the room to be constantly super heated despite leaving the window open, and then when I did turn on the fan or the air conditioning I couldn't even have a conversation on the phone and had to turn the TV up very loud, which I am sure that the neighbours weren't that impressed with.  This meant that I really didn't sleep very well on either night I stayed as I was either too hot or kept awake by the fan/air con.  And then if I did get the temperature comfortable the noisy plumbing started despite the air plugs.  So if you don't mind;4
Location, service and hotel in general are great. Bed I hard was uncomfortably hard, not just firm. May not be a factor for all. Food at the bar for dinner was delicious. Parking is convenient and not as expensive as other hotels in LA.;4
Gisel and her team were friendly and accommodating. They were also quick with recommendations. In terms of amenities, I had stayed at the Sofitel immediately prior to checking in here so the disparity in class between the two establishments was rather noticeable. Having said that, the service here was as great. I was a little concerned about the number of junkies and homeless lounging in the immediate vicinity of the hotel in particular and this section of Vermont Ave in general. However, the 24-hour front desk and security provided ample reassurance of safety.;4
Clean and comfortable room, hotel was good, staff were friendly. Not a fan of the location, kind of in a random spot, was further away from the main tourist spots than we thought, however the train was a 2min walk away which worked out good as the cabs were draining us dry.;4
The accommodation is clean, safe and quiet. With breakfast included the price is excellent. Close to the metro rail, it is extremely convenient. Staff are friendly and very helpful. A good choice on a budget in Hollywood.;4
Me and my daughter stayed here for 3 nights recently and found it to be a very good hotel, very good position near Central Park. The rooms were nice and clean and the staff helpful, especially the concierge with advise on where to eat etc. I would recommend this hotel, it was in a nice safe area and good value.;4
"Enjoyed our stay but only 2 of 4 elevators were working at any given time so we spent a lot of energy traipsing up and down the stairwells. The shower did not work properly; the overhead portion did not wok at all, so we were left with only the hand held / high pressure wand which resulted in a very wet , very small bathroom. Not well though out shower even if working properly I think. You'll see what I mean.. Great street view, friendly service all around and for us, a perfect location.";4
Stayed at end of November for two nights. Great location and great beds. Room was tiny and bathroom even smaller, very European in setup. But the tipping point is the high cost. We payed about $900 for the two nights, which is too much for this tiny room. Maybe we did not shop well for this room, but I believe I stayed at the Plaza once for less.  Very simply, it is very expensive for what is given in return.;4
I had read a few reviews on this hotel and to be honest they wasn't a million miles from the truth. when we arrived we seen the rooms were quite small however who goes to the big apple to stay in your room? in my personal opinion it was fine for me to sleep in after the days you have! The staff were very friendly and always helped if we needed anything, i had read on a review that the rooms were very noisey and you could hear the subway, i never heard a thing however the plumbing was a little noisey, but if your anything like me after walking around new york for 6-7hrs a day i'd sleep through a band playing. The view from the window in my room was not great but again im not there to look out the window all day.  This hotel is quite far out from times square and def would not;4
"Perfect, central location with Penn Station, 34th street subway, Macy's and Madison square garden within stumbling distance. No ""own"" restaurant but two associated restaurants in the building. (Dont expect to find a European continental breakfast, though.) Pricey so there are surely more cost effective places to stay. One of the few hotels on Manhattan that allow up to six persons in a suite.";4
the hotel was very clean staff were lovely breakfast was yummy but maybe just a bit expensive should have more variety for the cost outdoor air con units make it very loud in the room couldnât sleep very well;4
We have stayed at the Empire many times. Great location close to Lincoln Center. Great staff and housekeeping is especially excellent. We got a handicapped room and it was twice the size of the usual room and on the interior of the building, so it was quiet (by NYC standards). The fitness center is very minimal and there's no wifi service down there to listen to pandora :( but that's def not a deal breaker. It seems like the elevators could use some work but these things are minor. Highly recommend overall.;4
I will start by saying there were three beds in our roomâ¦two doubles and a very comfortable fold out sofa. This is a rare thing in NYC no matter your price point. Our room was very big with a great view of Lincoln Centerâ¦we even heard a choral group outside the center one night which was nice. The hotel is old and they have done a lot to modernize it. We would have liked more convenient electrical outlets and a coffee maker in the roomâ¦I suspect they donât offer this because there is a Starbucks just outside the hotel but I was missing my hot cup of tea at night. I found all the staff to be very nice. The housekeeping staff were always very friendly and provided us with all the extra amenities we needed with having three people in one room. A couple of tipsâ¦you can pick up;4
I love to travel and I needed a quick place to stay while in the area and this hotel ended up being quite nice. The room was a bit small, but it was only used for sleeping since I was out most of the day. The breakfast was a pretty great bonus and also the staff here. They seem to be equipped with the proper knowledge to handle all types of guests, especially one staff member, Jermaine. This guy was awesome, he was well-spoken and had a great sense of humor. Overall, my stay was enjoyable here.;4
First, the views here are amazing! My daughter and I had to take a moment to just take in the beautiful views. The location was perfect for sightseeing and touring the city. The staff was nice and the rooms are comfortable. I love the Hilton brand, they usually deliver quality. This establishment is definitely moving in the right direction.;4
My daughter and I travelled to this affordable and well situated Hotel for 5 days from April 16th to 21st. We had a Room with 2 large beds at the back of the Hotel on the 6th Floor. Our Room while dated had the most comfortable beds. We slept soundly and with New York being very warm that week.....Aircon was a Godsend ! The Subway was literally around the corner and across the Road making travel to Times Square effortless and fast.....7/10 minutes. A lovely Area to stay in with affordable Eateries,  in particular a lovely Wine Bar directly opposite the Hotel with delicious Tapas served in very generous portions. A middle of the road Hotel but very affordable and my Daughter has already booked a return visit !!;4
Very friendly staff and great location. Room and facilities were very clean. The hotel is an easy walk from Times Square, Central Park and Hell's Kitchen. Due to its proximity to bars and restaurants, it's a little loud throughout the night, but that proximity could also be a plus for many travelers seeking nightlife.;4
Loved the Jane hotel... its quirky, interesting, with lots of added features. The service is excellent with bell boys meeting you at the pavement, carrying your cases. All the staff we met were friendly and very helpful, dealing with queries immediately and satisfactorily. We had 'captain's room' and a view over the Hudson River, the room was small but stylish with good facilities and a wonderful shower. The bed was comfortable and air con good. The Jane is in a fab location next to the river, has bikes you can use, and we had a couple of rides up and down the nearby bike track which takes you up and downtown, quickly and there are amazing views. It is just round the corner from one end of the High Line, and the Whitney, the area is cool with plenty of eating places and is a;4
Stayed here with family and was a good trip. Checking in was quick and seamless we had two double rooms although we asked for a double and a twin room, however, they were not able to provide this as they were fully booked. Surely when we booked they should have told us this and not waited till we were at the hotel??  Rooms were nice but very very small but again only sleep in them so not the end of the world. The bathroom also very small, shower was nice but again small and cramped and no matter how much you tried to keep the water from going out the shower you just couldn't so there was always a soaking wet floor after you had a shower.  Location is fantastic and right near a subway station. Would maybe look for somewhere different next time. But for a last minute place, I'd;4
We booked our stay as a package deal with Universal Express tickets and we loved the convenience to the park. Only takes minutes to be inside (walking). The best part of this hotel was the AMAZING staff. They were ALL so pleasant and helpful. We were even able to attend the monthly Hiltonâs Honors reception and had a REALLY lovely time!    The only items that caused me to not give a full 5-stars is the fact our rooms bathroom door was incredibly squeaky AND that, in order to check-in early we were charged a $25 fee. Also, we were told that, because we booked through the universal site as a package, our Hilton Honors account couldnât be added. That was a big disappointment.   Overall, great, clean hotel for the proximity and GREAT dtaff. The staff MAKES this hotel!;4
I wish I had pictures of this place.  Not sure why I forgot to take a picture??   This hotel is very centrally located.  It is very busy!!  My room was nice and big but I seen and heard of others that are tiny.  It has nice architecture though and the staff were lovely!  My room was clean and well stocked.  My friends room had a kitchenette that was also very nice.  It is very old, but I think that gives it character!  It is also very close to the subway.  All in all it was a great stay!;4
Charming hotel - it felt like going back in time.  The bunk room was very small for two people, but that wasn't a surprise.  Everything was clean, including the shared bathroom down the hall, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.    Location is terrific - a quick walk into Greenwich Village, Chelsea Market, and the Highline.;4
Room booked was with a universal view. Looked like it had just been renovated. Very clean and fresh looking. Large room with 2 queens. Great view to Universal. Bathroom large enough for a family of 4 and once again very tidy and clean. Pool area was nice. Breakfast was from the cafÃ© take away on the ground floor as the breakfast by Hilton seemed quite expensive. Walk to Universal Studios was 10 min and so easy to do. Would stay here again.;4
Pleasant check in, easy location for universal, quiet and large room with great views. Beds could be a bit bigger tight for 1 adult and 1 child. Great breakfast and coffee shop great service as well. Easy parking .;4
Great spot, very close to LAX Airport, 24 hour shuttle service.  Only $20 a night to park your car which we did for 5 days while we were away.  Nice bar food and drinks area.  A good choice.  Note: make sure you get the right room key, we were assigned a room key which did not work, security were called to let us in our room after 20 minutes only to find someone in the bed, a little disturbing!!;4
Traveled to NYC with friends for a w/e to attend the St. John' vs Duke basketball game in Madison Square Garden. The New Yorker was our group's choice as it's right across the street! The hotel is an old 1930s era edifice with recent renovations. The room we had was spacious by NYC standards and clean though the bathroom was small. Both were clean. There was more than adequate closet space as well as drawer space in a bureau. In short, it was was a nice clean room and very good value in the heart of Manhattan!;4
The hotel is well  located near Metro Station. Well located near Madison Square Garden , Macy and few blocks from Time Square and Theatres. Affordable and clean hotel.  Very busy hotel with many travellers and tight security, Very pleasant and helpful staff. I would definitely stay there again.;4
I booked my stay at the Astor via the Opodo website where it came up as recommended by them. The price was extremely reasonable (Â£300 for 3 nights inc New Years Eve). I was concerned due to the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor but have to say I really really enjoyed my stay there and will definitely book to stay there again when returning to New York.   Our room had a comfortable double bed with views of central park. The room was small compared to other destinations but not for New York. The bathroom was relatively new and everything in the room seemed in good condition. It was all kept very clean and the bedlinen smelled really fresh.   103st subway was a 2 min walk and there are plenty of grocery stores nearby. We did not experience any problems in the neighbourhood and there is;4
Not much at all to fault here, rooms are great, they are clean and gave great amentities such as fridge, microwave, coffee machine and free wifi. Bit noisy with sirens during the night, but no big deal. Surrounding area looks a bit grungy around hotel, but had no problems having said that. Great transport facilties with bus and train stations very nearby. I found location quite central. Great little eateries around as well. Waba Grill was yummy as well as a little 'open' Mexican restuarant near train station.....best, authentic Mexican I ate in the U.S. Complimentary breakfast in the  morning is a winner!!!! All staff I dealt with were lovely. Would stay here again without a doubt!;4
Had an excellent stay at The New Yorker Hotel, rooms very comfortable with good amenities, staff very helpful & polite, excellent diner one side of the hotel, also a very good Italian restaurant on the other side. Hotel very well located for getting around New York, most attractions can be reached in a slow walk in round 30 minutes. If you don't like walking then there is a subway station located on the corner.;4
"I recently traveled to NYC for several days of business and The Jane was the closest hotel to my destination. It is also just steps from Pier 51 and 53, a great green space and walking/running spot, a few blocks from the entrance to the High Line and shopping.  I booked a Captain's Cabin with a request for a terrace to be away from the street. When I arrived, I found that that the lobby was up a flight of stairs; there was no one at the street level or at the door to assist but with a back issue, I have learned to travel light. There were no terrace rooms available when I checked in but I was upgraded to a Queen corner room. In the official picture of The Jane, two of the three windows in the room are to the right of the building's hotel sign.  The main window has a direct view";4
Stayed here over the Thanks Giving period with my wife.  This was our first time visiting NYC so can't compare with any other hotels but for what we needed it was perfect, great location and prefect for access to Subway.  Rooms were clean ( no TV service but who really goes to NYC to watch TV lol) Would deffo recommend this hotel to others who don't wanna waste money on expensive hotels, we had a problem with our radiator when we arrived which I reported to reception and and that was fixed immediately :) Good Location, Good Rooms and Good service what more do you need for a stay in NYC;4
The lobby and roof top is phenomenal.  Location is great as well. The hotel needs a little upgrade nonetheless.  For example, the bathroom is outdated.  The living room contains a closet that you could purchase at Walmart.  The fridge is empty, and water is not even available.;4
We stayed here for 4 nights while visiting Universal studios and Hollywood. We looked at several options in Hollywood but they were very expensive. The location accross the street from universal studios is great. You can also walk over on an evening for a meal at citywalk. Just a 15 drive into Hollywood to see the sites etc. Having now visited the Hollywood area I'm glad we decided not to stay there. The hotel is kept very clean and the rooms are spacious for a family of 4. The pool is large and very quiet when we used it. My only complaint is the parking charges which I think should be free, given what you are paying to stay at this hotel.;4
"Although the rooms are small, the hotel is beautiful. The location is the best part, right across from Lincoln Center with a small grassy (park) at the entrance and a Starbucks at the corner.  Once you get a handle of the bathroom sink and tap, you've got it made.  The lines outside waiting for the ""hotspot"" nightclub on the rooftop can be a nuisance but you grow used to it. Very pricey, but what isn't in NYC.";4
Staff were absolutely brilliant, made two separate great recommendations for food as well as being helpful in general.  Very good location and a nice clean room although quite small. Breakfast was the let down as it was literally some breakfast bars and orange juice- I don't think they should advertise this as breakfast included. On the whole good place though.;4
We stayed over a very snowy weekend, for a concert, so we couldn't get out for 2 days. Great friendly  staff, esp. Nick @ check in, &  Yuri the concierge. Cozy room, fair prices. Good place to work out in the basement. Perfect for Lincoln Center events.;4
The hotel is situated right opposite Central Park. For a fabulous introduction to NYC we walked the length of the park and into the city. If the hotel had been closer we'd have missed half the park, it's so big.  Within a 3 minute walk you can jump on the Subway for a 10 minute ride to Times Square, or practically right outside the hotel you can catch a bus and from there you can get anyway at all on Manhatten Island for $2 - and it really helps you get your bearings and see places. We got the bus everywhere and really enjoyed seeing the various parts of the city that'd we'd have missed from the subway.  The hotel location is great. Just a short, easy ride into the city and all the major attractions yet sufficiently far away to be able to get a quiet night's sleep. A taxi home;4
Great location across from Lincoln Center with good nearby restaurants.The Hotel appears to have been renovated fairly recently and has a hip and funky flair with lots of comfy seating in the lobby bar. The rooms are small but well planned. Good beds! Try to request a room not on an air shaft for a more pleasant stay.;4
Our room with 2 double beds was more than.adequate. The bathroom was small but shower great with good water pressure. Beds VERY comfortable. Had 2 windows, could see Chrysler building from one! Room was quiet and clean. Carpeting in hallway a bit worn and signs of wear and tear present in hotel. Subway stations within steps of building.;4
"I was hesitant after reading so many negative reviews but here I am relaxing in a pretty nice family terrace suite with an amazing view of the city! Contrary to what others have said, the beds are comfy & clean, the bathroom in clean and well stocked, even the sofa bed is nice and as new as any other hotel sofa bed. We have a dining table, fridge, great TV reception, comfortable climate control and the room smells nice & fresh. The hallways coming to our room are also nice & fresh. Is the hotel old, yes. Is it ""luxurious"", not exactly BUT for its time, yes it's pretty darned awesome! As with ANY hotel, we practiced general rules - no bare feet and don't assume it's just like home. Thousands of people are in and out no matter how ""fancy"" the hotel is. I'm hoping my photos prove";4
Hotels around Universal City aren't cheap, but this one was worth the price.  It was walking distance to Universal City Walk and Universal Studios.  The hotel also has a shuttle if you don't want to walk.  From our room, we could see the entrance to Universal Studios.  We had a suite, which gave us plenty of room for 3 kids.  The lunch buffet was very good for the kids, but not cheap.;4
We spent one night at this hotel, the room was good enough for just the night, they need to be updated but everything works fine for us, the shower had some stains on it but besides that room looks clean, the staff is friendly and welcoming the location is the best for our concert night, walking distance from Madison Square Garden we had no issues getting there on and leaving it at late night ! The check out was fast and the let us leave our luggage for an extra fee for all the time we want ! Definitely stay there again;4
We stayed for 1 night in August , is a very simple hotel , in an excellent location , the bathrooms are updated and the rooms are spacious and clean, the reception staff are very helpful and friendly .;4
On the hottest day of the hottest summer I ditched my apartment, jumped on the subway and checked my family (including our dog) into the Empire Hotel so that my kids could splash in the tiny, cold pool on the rooftop while I sat on the side with my legs in the water.  The hotel is in a great location: right across from Lincoln Center (check out the amazing dancing water fountain at night!) with lots of good restaurants right nearby (The Smith has great food and is very dog friendly!)  It's a quick walk to Central Park and right on a great subway line that will take you anywhere. The rooms are very clean.  They are not fancy, but they have great air conditioning.  The lobby is lovely.  We were all very happy for our staycation experience at the Empire, and will definitely do it;4
My family and I spent 1 day and 1 night here having had a long flight. Despite getting to the hotel at around 8:30am, the front desk were nice enough to give us a room at around noon. We had booked the club level so this was a good place to hang out until a room was available.  Wifi was easy to connect to and the snacks in the club were great.  The shuttle was fast - once we figured out what it looked like! There was no wait for the shuttle back to the airport even though it was very early morning.  It looks like the shuttle shares with the ride share across the street.  What I didn't like is the carpet seems to generate an enormous amount of static!  Every time we touched something metal we all got a whopping big zap :(;4
My parent and I went to these hotel for 5 days trip. The price is about 110 per night. The location is not close to the Hollywood by walk, but there is a subway station very close. The hotel is good and clean, but the internet wifi is not easy to log in. But overall speaking, this is a very good hotel. And the breakfast is good and free.;4
The staff is very helpful and nice! The rooms are big and spacious for four. The house keeping is the best by far. The coffee shop is no starbucks but is good. My family stayed for the celebrity experience event. Overall, my experience was great!;4
Good value and love the location.  We arrived with our golf clubs from vacationing in FL and they stored them for us at no additional fee, bellmen were super friendly and staff was very welcoming. Love;4
We stayed here for four nights, Monday to Friday in September for a birthday trip. Our holiday became slightly different after the news the Queen had passed away the week before, so we knew London would be much busier. As it happened the lying in state queue went right past the hotel door! The hotel itself was excellent, with a great location for seeing the sights. We stayed in a Premier plus room which was very well appointed and had everything we needed. The staff were super friendly and helpful at all times and we would definitely stay again. The only small let down was breakfast, which wasn't very good unfortunately, but we only ate here one morning and just found alternatives on the other days. Thank you to all of the premier inn staff who worked so hard during such a busy;4
The Empire Hotel is located across from the Lincoln Center and a block and a half from Central Park.  Fantastic location. More importantly, the hotel staff are excellent, courteous.  Hotel is clean. Enjoyed our stay!;4
We had a week in this hotel, our first visit to New York. As we had been warned that hotel rooms in NY are small and the beds likely to be, too, we upgraded. There was no need to worry. Our son and his wife had a 'normal' room, the bed of which was king size. The only difference between the rooms was that we had a wonderful though noisy view of Broadway and the Lincoln Centre and they had a small courtyard, which would have been quieter.  All in all, the public rooms were spectacular and indeed have been used for film locations, as seems to be the whole of NY.  Our room was good, bed very comfortable and so big that we had to phone each other to communicate (well, almost). The downside for us was the bathroom, which was quite small and tatty. I can't imagine when it was last;4
This was my second stay at the Jane and I was happy to return to this atmospheric hotel. The cabins are small, but clean and comfortable. The only thing is that they can get very hot - even with the window open and the fan on. You have to share a bathroom (unless youâre in a Captainâs Cabin) but I never had to wait to use them. The staff are welcoming and helpful and the location is great - close to the West Village and near the High Line. Thereâs a subway close by if you want to travel further afield.  There have been some comments about noise but Iâve never found this to be a problem. In short, The Jane is a great place to stay and Iâll certainly return.;4
Great location near Lincoln Center and Fordham campus. Rooms are small very clean and comfortable. Decor is Art Deco intense. Efficient check in, lots of help getting cabs or needs met by doormen. Lobby is a fun place to meet people for drinks, with many quiet spots to chat. Roof top was closed for reno. Awesome restaurants near by, some fun shops and Columbus Circle looks great at night. Would recommend without hesitation.;4
The hotel was very nice and we had great interactions with all staff.  There is only a outdoor pool and it was cool during our stay so we were not able to swim. We went to Universal several times which was a quick easy 10 minute walk. A big negative was the 2 small double beds for four people made for very uncomfortable sleeping.;4
Having, in the past, paid much (much, much) more for much (much, much) less 'room' in NYC, I was ecstatic when I saw my bill from the New Yorker.  Seriously, people who are complaining about tiny rooms and price do not understand how bad it can get in the city.  We visited about a week prior to Christmas, which is probably high-mid season in terms of pricing, but paid far less than we've paid in other 'trendier' areas of town to stay in absolute dumps during low season.    Our activities were all in midtown for this trip, so the New Yorker was super convenient.  But really as easy as it is to Uber to wherever you want to go, I'd stay here even if it wasn't necessarily close to my activities.  Rooms were clean, elevators plentiful and fast, front desk/concierge/valet/housekeeping;4
Before booking I had read the reviews and had seen some of the lower ones but noticed that the good was were really good. So taking a chance I booked a jacuzzi room for our stay after a convention we were attending in the city. The check in was quick, the staff was friendly and answered any questions we had about where to eat or how to get to attractions we wanted to see. The room was huge, a beautiful half circle bar, we should have had a party! It was clean, the sheets smelled great, the bed was so comfortable and the jacuzzi was wonderful!  Was it a new hotel no it was older but very well maintained. We ordered dinner in from the diner down the street, the food was fantastic. Not sure why people concerned about the neighborhood, we had no problem nor did we hear any sirens. I;4
The hotelâs located very good. Short drive to Walk of Fame, griffith observatory and Hollywood sign etc. Rooms are good in size. We have breakfast included, which has everything you need in the Morning. We would come back;4
A sort of stunning restaurants, bars and others facillities nearby, and the Lincoln itself makes this Hotel very well located. Staff is totally attentive and polite. Room clean and warm. Good hot water on bathroom.;4
I stayed here for 4 nights while moving my son to LA for school.  I don't think it was actually that close to Universal Studios and it wasn't too close to the freeway.  It's in an okay area, but has a pretty nice free breakfast that is served for longer than normal hours in a nice restaurant setting. Our fridge did not work, but it wasn't essential.  Room and bed were comfortable.  Had a little balcony. Parking is secure but is an extra charge. Son used fitness room and said it was good.  Pool looked nice (outdoor) but I didn't have time to use it. There's lots of entertainment opportunities in the downstairs bar although I didn't have the time to take advantage of that either. Complaint:  Elevators slow and no option to take stairs.;4
Nice rooms -- we upgraded to a deluxe.  Best shower ever!  Lobby was great.  Got coffee next door at SB, met the rest of the party in the lobby.  Rooftop bar with a fantastic view.  Then we found the beautiful bar and restaurant at Ed's Chowder House right in the hotel.  Staff was great everywhere in the hotel.  Convenient to subway and Central Park.  Wonderful stay.;4
I stayed at the New Yorker during a weekend of shopping and Broadway shows in Manhattan and believe itâs a good choice for a short trip. The price is ok and the location is just great nearby Times Square.  Service is good and quite quick compared to other others in the same neighborhood. You do not wait so much of time for the check-in and check-out.  The rooms are comfortable, although a bit old, but this goes with the affordable price.;4
We stayed at this hotel for 7 days. My stay was satisfactory, the staff is very friendly. Also the hotel is located close to several landmarks on New York as Time Square, the Empire State Building and Station Penn. There are also several shops for shopping.;4
Yes the rooms are small and the corridors could use updating, but that was part of the draw. It is the real deal. It's a classic art deco hotel with the Tic Tock Cafe and a block from Madison Square Garden! It had a better gym than most of the newer hotels I've stayed at.;4
I stayed here in 2010 and was going back to NYC as a party of 5 which included 2 teenagers. I chose the New Yorker again as I knew the location was good and it's a nice old style traditional hotel. I booked a suite which has 2 double beds and a double sofa bed. Upon arrival, I saw the hotel partially covered in scaffolding and I know they have been doing some refurbishments so if this would bother you ask when it will be taken down. Check in was easy, credit card needed to register and room keys given. Unfortunately, the 'lovely suite' they had for us was tatty, a bit smelly and had no view. I was disappointed as I recommended the hotel and the trip was for my Sister's Silver Wedding Anniversary but this room was below par. I went to reception and Krystle listened to my concerns;4
Each year, when we go to see the Macyâs Thanksgiving Day parade in the Hersld Square area, we stay at tha Wyndham New Yorker.  Perfect location, excellent security and hotel services and most appreciatedâindoor access to the Tick Tock Diner, a place that offers quality meals, 24/7, at low, low prices compared to outside the hotel. Love the views from the upper floors too! We always feel safe and comfortable at the New Yorker and will be back next November for sure.;4
Great location, very friendly staff, clean rooms. Only issue we had was we booked a room with a queen size been but were given a room with two double beds when we checked-in as they had oversold. Still the overall experience was pretty good and we would stay here again.;4
this location was great ! ( 8th avenue and 34th st) if you are doing anything midtown. we got off the train at penn central and only had to walk 2 blocks to get to hotel. we visited a lot of fabric stores that were on 37th -39th street and it was an easy walk. we also went to the theater at night and were able to walk there too. the hotel was clean and friendly. very small bathrooms!;4
Stayed 5 nights at the Americana room was comfortable clean  great location 5 mins from Times Square staff were all very pleasant doorman Jeff  Vlad on reception n Gina would definently stay there again;4
The location is perfect if you want more than shopping. There are a lot of restaurants, cultural options. The service was very nice. Mr. Ze, who also speak portuguese, was very helpfull.  The lobby bar is modern and  full of people all the time.  The only negative point was that they charge for the wifi in the rooms. Only the lobby wifi was for free.;4
I stayed at this hotel with some friends when visitng the city in April 2010. When we arrived, we were greeted by the bell men and helped with our luggage. We tried upgrading our room at the desk, but were told that no other rooms were available. The decor in the lobby was nice and everything was clean. Our room was small (the norm in NYC I'm told) but clean and nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable. We were able to open the window, feel the breeze of the city, and see the taxi traffic on the street below. The bathroom was extremely small but clean. We had to ask for more towels and received them without a problem.   The location of the hotel is excellent. It's within walking distance of the subway stations, and Central Park. There's a bus stop on the corner of the hotel;4
"Friendly staff; adequate accommodations; great location across from Lincoln Center and close to Columbus Circle, AAA recommended restaurants.  A/C is noisy--two different rooms.  Cheap breakfast available at Starbuck's next door; close to subway; Central Park 2 blocks away; Frick Collection walking distance; Museum of Art and Design;";4
No matter what purpose your trip is about, this hotel has the perfect location for culture, sightseeing (bus and metro), shopping, relaxing and sports. And not to forget the nice design and the roof-top-bar. Perfect place for a sundown drink.;4
Stayed last September and again last week till 5th December. Free wi-if in lobby and complimentary tea and coffee 6.30-10.00 a.m. Unfortunately no tea,coffee making facilities in rooms but there's a Starbucks across the road. We had good sized room with 2 double beds, good shower , safe and cupboard for hanging clothes. Rooms kept clean.We mainly saw JULIAN and SAID on door this visit and thank them so much for all their help and advice. They are so knowledgable and can help you with lots of questions. We had also had lots of assistance from JEFF last September. This was good time to visit for the lights and sales and weather  was good. Staff from Radio City were handing out leaflets for Christmas Show which gave half price for a fabulous show.;4
My only complaine was the shower head. Only the hand-held piece was working. This is fine but kind of annoying considering the price for the room. The big posiitve is the location if youâre planning to do anything around Lincoln Square. Also, the. Are plenty of seats and tales just across the hotel to sit an have your Starbucks with is next door, or eat a sandwich or wahetver. This was a relazxing surprise that you wonât find at hotels in the crowded area near Port uthority, pann Station or Time Square.;4
It is a little dated but it is a well oiled and run machine. Free shuttles are provided to Universal City. If you are visiting the Studios then this is the hotel to stay in. Book early as it is a busy hotel.;4
I have  appreciated the good  omelette off chef Hugo, very professional! The cleaning room was very good. The location is not satisfactory, but near the metro stop, price is balanced  I suggest this hotel for staff, cleaning, breackfast andÃ² price;4
This is a great place to stay and very conveniently located.  There is a subway station right next to the hotel and is walking distance to practically everything including Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Empire State Building, the new High Line Park, Rockefeller Center to name a few, and there are plenty of places to eat nearby.  There is a bakery just down the block called Angelina's which is FANTASTIC, a CVS next door, plus a liquor store, McDonalds and Starbucks across the street.   The Tik Tok Diner in the hotel is a great place to eat.  The hotel retains its original character and it's well worth the time to go downstairs and read all about it's history and the people who have stayed there.  It is a great value! We have stayed here twice now, once just overnight on our;4
This hotel is a great value for the price.  The location is great - literally across the street from the subway and near stores and restaurants.  The room is small (no surprise in NYC) but comfortable and clean.  All equipment functioned properly and the staff was friendly, competent and helpful.  I'd recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the city!;4
Service: We didnât really interact with the front desk that often, but Graciela was great. We made a last minute booking and they accommodated us with ease.  Room: We got a King bed room that was updated in like the last 7ish years maybe. It was spacious for New York standards and comfortably fit two people. The room itself was clean. The bed was actually pretty great especially after long hours of walking. The AC unit can be a bit loud, but honestly I didnât notice. All I cared is that it worked and kept the room chilly. The power outlets could definitely be improved and be more accessible, but it really didnât bother us much. As for sound, the room next to us was a family with kids and we didnât hear them or anyone else at all. Could the room be updated? Yeah. But did the;4
"The hotel is super convenient; about a block from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was a little small, but very clean and comfortable.    The only complaint would be the lack of working elevators.  We were on the 26th floor.  It appeared that most guests were on the upper floors.  Even though there were a bank of elevators that went to 20th - 40th floors, only a few were working.  In the mornings all elevators were packed.  Supposedly only 10 people can get on or it will get stuck.  We ended up using the staff elevators to get down to the lobby.";4
I was looking for good deals in LA when I found this hotel... Really clean and staff is really friendly and helpfull, specially la Sra Sonia y Oralia... Very fun and always smiling.  Parking is charged and I found quite expensive, but subway is right on the corner. They say it has a queen size bed, but actually it is a double bed. I really recommend;4
Stayed at this hotel for weekend with two friends and her dogs. Very big rooms, comfy beds, pillows were too soft but ok. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast . Nice lounge area .The staff was friendly and helpful. Gated parking lot for hotel guests.;4
Hotel is in a great location for Central Park. The Chowder House restaurant and the Roof top bar were both great. Food in the restaurant was very good. Staff are very friendly. There was a draft from the bedroom window which was not good however I would return to the Empire.;4
Ideal location.  Minutes from Colombus Circle. Proximity to John Jay University is a plus as I attended a venue there. My only pet peeve is the noise level. I realize The Empire cannot control the outside noise or the patrons who leave their bar at 2 or 4 a.m.  I gather from others also staying at the Empire that the noise level and vibration from the upstairs bar is an issue, especially on weekend nights.  Other nights of the week were not as noisy.;4
Service was good.  The room was good and clean . Nice amenities.  Beds were ok for 1 night . Pillows were good. 2 bathrooms in room with 2 double beds was a definite plus. Hotel was central to many attractions.  Great location.;4
Location, Location, Location....The New Yorker is truly in the heart of NY City. Located in walking distance from Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Broadway, and Times Square. Just a few miles from at least a dozen other world recognized tourist attractions.;4
Fresh omelets and waffles, fruit, cheese plate, pastries, cereal, toast and friendly staff ( a great way to start your day). Our balcony wasn't much but there was a lovely courtyard, lounge chairs by the pool and comfortable chairs on the outdoor common balcony at the end of our 2nd floor hotel room. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable.   Another great thing to note is that the hotel is located very close to the red line metro which made getting around without a car a better experience than I expected. That one line took us to Hollywood, Universal Studios and Downtown. As well, simple bus routes took us to Paramount Studio, Beverly Hill, The Original Farmer's Market and the CBS Studio.;4
We enjoyed our stay.  Your staff was very engaged and ready to assist in any way possible.  They delivered on all expectations.  The facility was clean, well organized and customer ready when we arrived and throughout our stay.;4
I enjoyed the hotel at every turn. It pleasantly surprized myself and my wife. We expected something more dated but really it was a great hotel. Well decorated, good rooms (slightly smallish, we felt could have been 3 feet wider), wide hallways, secure parking, marble floors throughout ground floor, quiet court yard great for reading.   The staff was great and I connected well with Ekaterina who showed professionalism, enthusiasm and went the extra effort to explain policy and any questions I had.  The only complaint was the excessive cost of parking ($22/day) which brings up the overall cost of the hotel... so add this into your hotel estimate.;4
First let me say  I would've given them five stars if there was a laundry room.  Other than that let me tell you how convenient this hotel was.  It was about a 6min walk to universal studios, and if we didn't want to walk there is a free shuttle that'll take you to Universal City Walk.  Lots to do lots of places to eat.  And if those food places isn't your cup of tea right down the road on Ventura Blvd. is a mess of dining options with the bonus of a trader Joe's in the mix (ALWAYS a treat for Hawaii folk) ð.  With all that being said book it the staff is great location is better, I'll be back for sure!;4
We chose this hotel because of it's reviews on here, and we are pleased that we did. We stayed for 3 nights as we were going to Universal Studios for Halloween Horror Nights, and knowing that it was likely to be a late night we wanted somewhere a short walk away - and this fitted the bill perfectly. From check in to check out we were met with friendly smiles, and nothing appeared to be too much trouble. The room was large and comfortable, with great views over Universal Studios and Hogwarts. Should we be in the area again we wouldn't hesitate to stay here.;4
You cannot beat the location of the Empire or the friendliness of their staff. We had a comfortable bed, easy access to the city and great restaurants nearby. The staff at the Empire were very helpful and friendly. The pool was closed because of inclement weather.  I read several negative reviews about the age of the Empire and the quality of the rooms but I didn't find the same issues. The elevator always worked and our room was clean. Yes, the bathroom is tight but every bathroom in the city is! The in-room food is very expensive but you don't have to eat it. With a Starbucks, Duanereade and P.J. Clark's below - all your food and beverage needs are close!;4
Stayed 4 nights at the hotel.    The hotel is in a great location and within 5/10 minutes walk from Times Square, Central Park and more.     Bedroom was a good size for NYC and the bathroom was very well appointed with a walk in rain shower.  Only minor comment about the bedroom was the lack of tea/coffee making.  Was available trhough at the small bar area free of charge.  There isn't a serviced restaurant on site however there is so much choice in the area you don't miss it.   Another plus point is the free wifi throughout which was great.  Last but not least the staff throughout the hotel who were friendly and helpful.  All in all a very good base for a visit to the big apple.;4
"The Hilton was filled with friendly staff from arrival to departure. Our concierge, Jesse, was extremely helpful, providing ""cheat sheets"" for getting around Los Angeles and getting the most out of your tourist attraction visits. The only downside was the hotel (especially the lobby) was very cold at all times and when one elevator was not working, the process to get downstairs was extremely slow. Room was nice enough.";4
"My wife and I along with my daughter and son in law are just back from a 5 night stay here. The location is great just across the street from the Lincoln centre, very close Columbus Circle and central park and the subway a 2 minute walk from the entrance and buses almost on the door step.. The lobby is sumptuous with a nice cosy bar, good music and a relaxed vibe in the evenings. Check in straightforward and a very helpful concierge. We found the front desk to be helpful but the lifts were a bit of a problem. The room was ok, with two nice sized beds, a good shower and a big screen LCD TV. Some of the furniture was looking a little ""tired"" but overall the hotel was fine. I have an issue in this day and age that Wifi in the room cost $13 a day and was free in the lobby and bar";4
We stayed 10 days at the hotel , we are totally satisfied.The staff members Gisel , Jessica, Cynthia ,Hugo and Juan , that we had a chance to deal with ,were very friendly and very helpful.The beds were very comfortable.Good air conditioning.We slept very well during the whole stay. Great breakfast included in the morning , what a great way to start the day ! The hotel is located at 5 minutes from the nearest metro station, and a few stations from the main attractions.The only thing that I think , that was missing , was to have a morning paper. But then again , it is not something that bothered me that much. I would strongly recommend this hotel ,and would stay at the same location , if I were coming back to Los Angeles.;4
Hotel had a beautiful lobby, restaurant and facilities.  Room was clean with nice bedding.  Room was pretty small and had a rolling portable heater which was unusual.  Breakfast buffet was fantastic!  Made to order eggs and lots of selection. Staff were all exceptionally polite and nice except for the Housekeeping manager who argued with me over asking for more coffee/creamer in the room!  Overall a nice experience.;4
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 4 nights after finding a great deal through bookit.com.  Although the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was a little bit sketchy, the location itself was very convenient to Hollywood attractions.  A metro station on the red line is just one block south of the hotel, and this line takes you out to Universal Studios (and the other attractions on Hollywood Blvd.).    We paid $18 per night to park in a gated lot.  Otherwise, we would have had to park on the street (which seemed a little risky).  The room was small but adequate, with a patio overlooking a fountain and courtyard.  The hotel had several amenities including a pool (no hot tub), sauna room, and exercise room.  A continental breakfast was provided with decent food selection.    The;4
"Quick check in. Many rooms in the hotel so felt like little maze. Towel is provided. Decent clean room for price. Friendly staff. Location is ""ok"" elevator in hotel for convenience. Bedding wasn't that great, so it may not be the great sleep you get out of this place.";4
very near to the airport , huge and spacious property , good food and clean rooms.this was my second time staying at the hotel, staff is very good. i love the bar but needs more staff because it gets crowded.over all the hotel is GOOD.;4
First is location.  Hard to be better at the intersection of 34 th st and 8 th Avenue across from Pennsylvania Station. I used to visit this hotel with my parents 50 years ago. It dates back to 1929.  It has had a checkered career but now is under the Wyndham banner and things are looking good.  This is an Art Deco masterpiece. The museum and photo display in the downstairs lobby was a lot of fun. The rooms were comfortable though on the small side. The staff was extraordinary nice. At the time they had an extra facility fee which seemed to be added to all the bills to cover WiFi and exercise and business equipment. A bit odd, but we got a deal on price. . We had a very nice two days at the new New Yorker.  Never had to wait for an elevator. They have lots ... old style;4
Booked in for two nights pre cruise. Great location, close to Macys etc etc. Welcoming staff, we had a great room with a view of the Empire State, and two Queen size beds, our friends not so lucky, a double bed with a view of the wall. Unable to move them as full. Tick Tock very convenient, huge portions. good breakfast, very busy with walk in customers.Staff very helpful, we returned to the hotel after disembarking from the ship, and were able to leave our luggage with them for a small charge as we had a late flight home.;4
Nicely surprised by the nicely renovated lobby and rooms (it's been years since I stayed here). The staff is friendly and helpful, in fact most every employee were as good as many luxury hotels. The food and bar are very pleasant. Great location for music, theater,close to lots of transportation. Highly suggest upgrading the roomtype. The standard queen (entry level) is very small, like many hotels of this era. The deluxe king facing Lincoln Center was a great room.;4
"When I travel for business, I have to stay at corporate-approved hotels and this was on our list for NYC. Proximity to the subway lines were important to me and this hotel is very well suited for public transit (if the weather were bad, you could even cut through the Tick Tock Diner attached to the lobby to reach the closest subway entrance). My recent stay was for nearly 8 days and my corporate-approved rate only allowed me to book a room with a single bed. At check-in the front desk clerk noticed the length of my stay and ""upgraded"" me to a room with ""more space."" I have stayed in many NY hotels and they typically have very small rooms, but this was one was small even by NY standards - and the clerk said he gave me the biggest room available. I imagine the extra space came in";4
This was our first stop after a long 14 hour flight from Australia, travelling with my family, kids aged 3 & 6. We were not disappointed. We were quickly checked-in and upgraded to free wifi and breakfast! Rooms were dated but well sized, clean and most importantly after a long journey, beds were super comfortable. Buffet breakfast was basic but adequate. We ate lunch and dinner elsewhere while exploring. The Hotel is a very short walk to Universal Studios and Universal City Walk. Here you can find an abundance of shopping and restaurants. We also walked (short but has a steep hill), in the other direction, and took the subway to Hollywood. All staff were helpful and pleasant. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay and a great start to your USA holiday.;4
We stayed at the Hilton Universal having stayed there before. It is the closest hotel to universal, an easy 10 min walk away (there is also a shuttle). The only complaint we would have is the slowness of the check in staff. Not just for us but everyone it seems. There is no express here! they really need to improve their service and streamline check in. It also took 30 mins for the bellboy to collect our bags on checkout. The pool is a decent size but is in need of repair and the hot tub is even worse. This hotel needs some TLC in some places whilst others appear to have been recently refurbished. We were on the executive floor and this was in very good condition. The breakfast buffet is very good with excellent variety.We would definitely stay here again.;4
"We were in town to do a show during ""sweeps week"" and client put us up here. Initially a tiny room on southeast side was given and we upgraded to a northern and Highest floor possible room. The first room was so small for two that it was uncomfortable with no place for luggage and not any view to speak of and as my lovely girlfriend accompanied we felt an upgrade was in order. The 1st room certainly was decent enough though for those who don't care about the view and just sleeping. The 2nd had a lovely view of Lincoln center and uptown and was large enough to accommodate both of us and our luggage and shopping trinkets. Staff is gracious and service very good. Be forewarned of the siren noise.";4
This is the second time I have been at this hotel. I choose it because its location to Universal Studios . I was on the 14th floor alcove room. Great view. Room was clean and very quiet at night. Room service was friendly and prompt. Had no problems. Will return again when I am in the area.;4
As opposed to some recent reviewers of this hotel, we felt we'd made a very good choice for our one-night stay.  My husband was scheduled for a medical procedure at Kaiser's Sunset & Vermont hospital early on a morning when rain was expected, so we decided that, rather than brave the congealed traffic we'd face driving in from LA's West Valley on that morning, we'd come into Hollywood the night before & stay over.  A friend recommended Loew's Hotel, near Hollywood & Highland, but when we realized we'd have to pay $250 + parking, we looked elsewhere!  With the Auto Club discount, our room at the Hollywood Hotel was well under $100 for the night, plus we had free parking in the gated lot & a free hot breakfast served early enough (6:30) to allow me to eat before we went off to the;4
Loved our visit to the New Yorker! Made mistake on reservations. Madeline Marte took care of our issue and made our first trip to NYC a memorable one. Room we had was small but it is the big city, folks. Reminded us of our hotel in London in that regard. Location to Penn station was awesome--basically next door. 34th sub station on nearly every corner. Central location tough to beat! Thanks New Yorker!;4
Comfortable hotel in great location. Rooms are small but typical of updated historic NYC hotel. Single occupancy double bed and pillows were very comfortable. Small closet and adequate work desk in room. Bathroom adequate with tub/shower. Shower water alternates between very cold and very hot without warning...also typical of older, 30-floor hotels. Gym is adequate with barbells, machines, bikes, and treadmills. Clean facilities and friendly staff.;4
We chose this hotel for our family of 6 -- 2 adults, 1 senior and 3 children 10, 9 and 4 -- because of proximity to Getty Museum and Universal Studios, and high reviews in Tripadvisor. From our 2 nights, highlights are: upon check-in, our reservation  requests for connecting rooms and double queen beds per room were both accommodated. Spacious room. Comfortable bed. Fluffy towels. Strong shower. Good housekeeping. Shuttle to Universal Studios (if you really don't want to walk). Consistent and strong wifi. Ample continental breakfast of breads, an apple, and coffee/hot choco. Starbucks drinks sold within hotel property. Some things to reconsider about the hotel: tired carpet, old elevator (doesn't light up on some floors, missing buttons), fixed shower head, and average service;4
I stayed here for 4 days while in the city on business and completely enjoyed my stay.  I was given an upgraded room which was tastefully appointed in modern decor.  The platform bed was extremely comfortable.  I found the room to be clean and the bathroom sanitary.  Amenities such as free wireless, coffee maker and flat screen tv added to the enjoyment of my stay.  I flew into JFK and decided to save some money, so I took the train all the way to the 96th station right across the street!  Cab ride, $65.  Train $13, including transfers to the subway. Took about 40 minutes.  Great location on Broadway with plenty of eateries and shops, including a gym across the street.  Very reasonable rates for NYC, I would definitely stay here again!;4
"Super friendly and attentive staff. Clean room and bathroom. The location is great; few blocks from two subway stations, Central Park and Columbus Circle. The only downside is the shower pressure was not that good, and someday, water wasn't hot enough in the morning.";4
My family and I total 6 -- there are 3 adults and 3 teenage children. We visited Universal Studios and wanted a convienent place to stay. This was it-- they have a tram that runs every 15 min.so you never have to use your car while you are there. They do charge 18 dollars a day to park though. The rooms are great and the view( if you are facing the right way) is beautiful. My only complaint is your choice of beds in the room. Your choice is - 1 King or 2 Full beds  They don't have queen beds, so it was a little uncomfortable when your used to a larger bed. The breakfast was fabulous, but very expensive. This hotel is NOT cheap, but I think its worth it. I will stay here again, next time we visit Universal Studios.;4
I would definitely go back here again! It is not like the chain hotels but instead gives a real feel of what a New York hotel is like. Rooms are small but that's the reality of life in New York. I lived there most my life and can say it's a good stay- there is a 24 hour cafe downstairs with great New York flavor diner type food and an Asian restaurant around the corner - excellent. Macys 34th street, Broadway, Madison Sq gardens, LI railroad, subway, and Times Square etc. a quick and beautiful close walk. Location is excellent.;4
Yes, the cabin rooms are teeny tiny - but I found mine clean, comfortable and perfectly adequate for my needs (I'm not coming to New York to hang around in my hotel room, after all). There was a storage rack above the bed and another below with two big drawers as well as a rail with hooks above the mirror, so unless you have giant-size luggage there is plenty of storage space. The location is fantastic and the free bicycles are  definitely worth using if the weather permits - be warned they have no gears and it's back-pedal to brake, but I cycled comfortably to Harlem and back via Central Park, the Met and and the wonderful Hudson River cycle tracks and felt safe all the way (I did occasionally dismount when needing to use the pavement and there were lots of pedestrians). I;4
Stayed for 3 nights  Room was clean and ample for 2 adults.  Bed was very comfortable but creaked a little when we turned over.  Only 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel were provided but we asked for more and they quickly obliged.  We opted for full breakfast which was buffet style. Plenty of choice and delicious.  Both check in and check out were smooth and the luggage was kept in a secure room until we were ready to travel home.  Staff were friendly and approachable and very attentive.;4
My hubby and I were traveling from Singapore. We chose this hotel because of their location, a decent 5 minutes walk to the Universal Studio. Good location to the theme park and the metro station. Rooms were clean. Rates were affordable. Staff were not too friendly though, or maybe we are Chinese..?!;4
"We arrived an hour before official check in but our room was ready for us. We had a room on 19th floor, lifts were fast, room was clean and the bedding was very comfy. We were never bothered by room maids but they did a great job. Hotel itself is very well located and has everything you would need near by. Overall we had a pleasant stay but the service ""resort fee"" lets the reputation down. For this fee I was suppose to be able to make international calls, well I tried a number of times using the instructions but kept getting a message saying the call could not connect. Wifi this was very week if worked at all, Our devices would say it was connected but when wanting to use it nothing would load, as soon as I switched over to 3G messages/emails came flying through. We were most";4
Try to get a room on floor 12 for amazing views of airport. We. Insulated externally but not between rooms. We could hear all the conversations next room early in the morning. New, clean and stylish. But if u are using a car almost impossible to find from Google map when traffic.;4
Long time new Yorker customer and Wyndham rewards member. Everything went as expected from check-in to check-out. Great! After 20 years keeps experience keeps getting better and more floors renovated.;4
The lobby is beautiful and the rooftop restaurant has a great view. There is free wifi in the lobby but it's quite expensive to have it in your room. The rooms are small but they are very nice. Great location just a few minutes from central park.;4
Great place to stay!  Room size not a problem here! King size upgrade can sleep 3 adults. Great restaurant inside and in the vicinity. Central Park, Lincoln Center in walking distance. Staff very eager to make your stay comfortable.;4
Though we live in L.A. County when asked where he would like to travel this summer, our son said LA (we usually take a cruise or do a foreign trip.  So, we organized tours around L.A. and on one stayed for a night at this tourist attraction Hilton next to Universal.  We did not expect much because, well, first of all its a Hilton - not particularly high end (though I regularly stay at them for business).  Second, LA hotels are not noted for their excellence and third, it is, after all, a tourist location hotel that caters to traveling familes.  Were we surprised.  The hotel is spotless. The service from the valet to reception to the waitstaff to everyone we had interactions with was very cheerful, helpful and what you would expect from a Ritz or Four Seasons.  It appears that;4
Found it pretty easily and loads of space in the self park area, lift to reception and straight to check in with no queue.  Good service from the staff and a nice open area with the buffet/restaurant and bar area.  Room was great and everything you would expect, slightly annoying you have to pay for the WiFi but flip that over you get free use of the fitness centre so hey ho.  Also there was a slight niggle with the iron in the room but it was exchanged no problem - they thought it was 'cute' that my Wife brought it down to reception rather than having to wait for it to be collected!  The real bonus of this place though is the very short walk to the Universal Studios park and retail/food space next to it.  You are there on foot in less than 5mins - we were amazed to hear and;4
We had a great stay the night before our trip back from LA. The rooms were great - very modern, clean and silent. It had a nice gym at the top floor and a nice swimming pool area, although the location of the swimming pool was a bit odd on ground floor next to the parking lot (and the air traffic made it very noisy but I guess that is unavoidable). The restaurant did not seem very appealing to us (dark and dull) so we chose to go to Venice for dinner, but the breakfast buffe was great. The location is perfect if you need to leave early from the airport but would not choose this hotel to explore LA. All in all a great stay!;4
We stayed at this property to participate in the NYC Marathon. The Staff was very helpful in all aspects. Special shout-out to Jeff (The Doorman) as he helped us find the best way to get around town and provided great recommendations for Eating Out (Fancy and Quick Bites).;4
I'd probably award this hotel 4.5 stars instead of 4 and you will see why that is later on in this review. I think this is a great hotel. The staff there are very friendly and are committed to customer service.   This was evident in an issue that was resolved by the manager in an expeditious manner. I also found that the guest service agents were welcoming and friendly. The hotel is very clean which was very important in my decision to stay at this hotel. Sometimes it's extremely difficult to find clean affordable accommodations in the big cities. My only gripe is that that there are no coffee machines in the rooms. I had a peanut allergy reaction to food that I had purchased at Cascades. I had to get up at 4am in the morning to buy ginger ale at the Subway restaurant as there;4
The hotel lobby was gorgeous in an Art Deco style - there is a little museum downstairs of the history. There are 2 restaurants attached which we didn't get a chance to eat in  The reception is busy but the staff are very polite and helpful. There is a luggage storage area and computers available downstairs for printing boarding passes etc.  Someone checks keys before you enter the lifts to ensure the hotel is secure for guests. There are plenty of lifts so we never had to queue for long.  Our room was on the 36 floor. Unfortunately we did not have views of the ESB or Crystler but it was still exciting to see the city. The room is a little tired but perfectly adequate. It's NYC - all you're going to do is change and sleep. The shower was forceful and hot and the bed was comfy.;4
The staff were very helpful & friendly. the room was a twin bedded on e. Very clean, clean bedlinen..basic but clean!! only problem was somebody having an argument at 2am in morning.....otherwise o.k. Bathroom was 2 doors down and spotless!! Only stayed one night but was v. good value.;4
The main advantage of this hotel has to be that it is right next to Universal Studios.  You just walk outside the hotel, follow the arrows and you are right at the front of Universal Stuidos.   The check-in process was fast and the front desk was very nice.  Lobby was very nice looking.  I had reserved a 1 king bed room and was given 2 double beds which I was very disappointed with.  Called the front desk but they couldn't help me and I did not want to wait around trying to switch rooms later.  The room itself seemed larger than normal, it seemed to be stretched out long.  It also had a great view, I could see the front of Universal Studios from our window.  Which is great at night because the lights from the city walk looked nice.   Did try out the room service, great food and;4
"I stayed here with my girlfriend for the vet show (walking distance to Olympia) combined with a short London break. The room was fine, if Spartan, with an unexpected en-suite bathroom which was good & roomy; also a fridge. There is often a strong smell of disinfectant, I don't think any bugs could survive the cleaning regime. We had stayed the previous year, so brought our own cooking utensils (there is a chronic lack of pots, pans etc in the building). There are a lot of new microwaves and ovens since last year, so can't complain on that score. The immediate area is very quiet and peaceful, on a small road but only a couple of minutes from the bustle of Hammersmith tube. Transport to central London is easy by tube or bus, and if you choose to stay on foot in the area, there is";4
"Great location; moderate food in regency club, friendly service, clean and good ambience; very near to airport, but quite silent and not noisy! Car parking is expensive unless you are a globalist member!";4
I have stayed many times at the Empire and always appreciate the comfort of the room and friendliness of the staff.  My only complaint--the rooms are SO SMALL, especially the bathroom.  I hope as they renovate in coming years, they consider making the rooms a bit bigger and adding a few inches to the bathrooms.;4
I travel to Hollywood often.  This is an above-average property for the area.  I would happily stay here again.  I am an electric car owner and I was happy to see that there are EV charging stations on the property that were being utilized by guests.;4
This was our first time in LA visiting from NY. My 2 daughters and I had a great time!!!  The stay was better than I expected!! We stayed 4 nights and 5 days. Convenient to the train and buses, free breakfast, comfortable and clean rooms, pool, sauna, lounge area etc. The staff was nice.  We stayed on the 3rd floor. No loud noises or disturbances. Conveniently, there was a fridge and microwave!! However, no dresser drawers. Overall, the room was really good!  I wasnt expecting a 5 star hotel. I was sold more on convenience, and Hollywood Hotel delivered. Next time we'll plan a day to spend in the hotel to enjoy the other amenities.;4
No room service or good food options and the bar on lobby floor is downright depressing, while the rooftop bar at night is really cool.  Location is great for all things Central Park.  Room very affordable (at least during March).;4
Staff was very helpful and friendly, which is one of the most important things for me.  However, toilet paper was very much like sandpaper, water pressure was not strong enough, water wasnât hot enough, and there were small stains on or. Of our towels and on the bed sheet when we arrived.  The fan in the bathroom also did not work.  The location was convenient since it was very close to Universal studio.;4
Brilliant location. Go to Lincoln center for shows and Central Park for walking/biking. They drop prices for the room the day before so if you can wait to book do so! The same room I stayed in was $100 cheaper the day before we stayed. Silly me!;4
needed a hotel in Lincoln center 4* although it was a very busy weekend in NYC we were able to get the hotel for a good deal. it was comfortable and what we needed. Room was small and shower needed attention but service was good. House keeping was very good.;4
Loved that the Empire was walking distance to Lincoln Center, Upper West Side, Hell's Kitchen and Broadway. Depending on how much time you'll spend in the room it might be worth upgrading from a Standard Room to have more space. The decor is nice and the bed was comfortable. Unfortunately, the desk space was almost completely devoured by the tray of absurdly priced snacks and a Keurig machine offering a $3 cup of coffee. There's a Starbucks 50 ft. from the front door, for cryin' out loud! In other weirdness, in the standard Queen they are generous with the towels but you have request a second WASHCLOTH on a daily basis. Just odd.;4
First off when you walk in to the lobby there are high ceilings where the stairs are and dark sofas and chairs. With dim lighting you almost feel like you are in a lounge. The staff so helpful from the second I stepped out of the taxi. They quickly took my bags and escorted me in like I was royalty.( I believe his name was Jose?) There were a few people ahead of me but the front desk agents were quick with checking them in so I only had to wait a few mins. When I final reached the front desk to collect my room key, the agent Lila? was so helpful and delightful. I asked her a great deal of questions about the hotel and area and she had an answer them all even my absurd ones I wont write on the Internet. My room was small, but what do you expect in New York City. But the reason I;4
Beautiful Hotel, staff was amazing and offered extra support. Very convenient to airport and minutes away if you like to walk. Near bus lines and plenty of shopping nearby. Soundproof room is a big deal and you will sleep great!;4
Perfect location close to the empire state building,time square,macys,and numerous restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is a little bit tired but my room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff were very polite and helpfull. The restaurant food was excellent along with the breakfast bar.;4
Our first trip to New York, chose a hotel randomly and wow, did we choose well.  We arrived to a super welcome, Cliff (or Clifford) the concierge was so helpful, easy check in.  Rooms fine not the most luxurious but very clean and well appointed.  A view of Central Park was almost surreal, after all the years of seeing it in films we were really here.  We had breakfast every day in the restaurant which is on the hotel premises but not run by the hotel. We were able to walk to Times Square, the location of the hotel was ideal.  Will be recommending it to friends.;4
the location has a lot to offer but you need to press the staff to find out what they offer, a map of the grounds can be found at the front desk and i recommend taking a picture to help locate the gym and pools.;4
"I recently stayed here for a weekend back in June. I have to say I was blown away! Great, attentive front desk staff; and a REALLY nice room!  The real hilight for me was the pool deck. The DJ up there had a REALLY great mix; kept me and my friend dancing all night..... The manager up there (I think Joe or Joey was his name?) was one of the nicest, friendliest guys I've ever met; and I've stayed at a lot of hotels. He kept coming around asking if we needed anything; making sure we were satisfied. He also felt really genuine,a lot of times you get those managers who come across as fake and just trying to get a good tip or something; but he was so sincere and so pleasant; if I wasn't staying at the hotel; I'd go back just to chat with him again!  Great time over all!";4
I enjoyed my time at the astor on the park hotel recently. I am aware reviews can be personalised and may not reflect a very universal opinion, and experiences can be different for whatever reason. There a a few aspects about this hotel though that i can assure will be to everyone's satisfaction (unless you are a handful of these strange regular hotel-goers who expect the earth). Firstly the staff are great. Very friendly, helpful and courteous. I arranged a few things with the hotel including the classic new york sightseeing tour and transportation back to JFK airport.   Secondly, the place is very presentable. Rooms are cleaned once a day from what i could make out and the whole place looks quite modern and well kept, certainly nice enough for me.  This could be a matter of;4
Location great across from Penn Station food great breakfast, lunch, dinner very tasty service great courteous and kind and very helpful I would stay here again if I was to come back. Time Square close;4
In this review Iâll try to address all the major critics people have made about the hotel, from my own experience. My partner and I stayed in the hotel for a week during the Easter week.   Since I have read all the reviews on noisy inner rooms due to the venting system, flooding showers, scandalous lobby, rude staff and noise form the rooftop, I wrote an e-mail two weeks before arriving in the hotel specifically requesting a room away from the noise sources listed above and which wouldnât flood (since Iâd read some peopleâs reviews which said they managed to get reassigned to such better kinds of rooms). They replied a few minutes later saying they would add this special request to my reservation.  We arrived very early on Sunday morning so we left our luggage and went out to;4
The hotel was clean and efficient.The staff was friendly.  The pool area was great if you didn't mind the fumes from the shuttles or planes. Definnitely one of the better hotels here. I was very impressed that i was not able to hear the airport much from my room.;4
Stayed for 4 nights. We were Upgraded at check in. Bottle of complimentary sparkling wine left in the room for my birthday. Very friendly and helpful staff. Room very clean and modern. Little bit small but didnât need it any bigger as we didnât spend much time in our room. Butcher and banker restaurant in the hotel is way over priced. Was expecting a lot more for what we paid.;4
Overall this is a nice hotel in a good location particularly if you don't want to be in Midtown or the Times Square area. In addition, they have valet parking which is a positive if you are driving. The staff are very accomodating and gave us no problem when we had to change rooms due to a heating issue. The price is very reasonable for NY and there is a significant discount when booking the non-refundable rate. That being said, the bathrooms are very small and have literally no counter space and the shower doesn't have a full door (completely open on half). I did find this to be inconvenient given that we were in a junior suite and I was with my family of four. If I could I would give this a 3.5/5.;4
I stayed in a single bed room which was very comfy and was great for what I needed.  The location was great right next to the Hudson River and a 5 minute walk from the High Line Park.  The bathroom is shared however while I was there it was always clean and I didn't have to wait for a free shower.  The staff were very helpful and the small cafe next door was lovely.  Never had any problems with bed bugs or loud noise from the club downstairs.  The only issue I had was a very loud selfish git banging on doors at 3am shouting at his mates, that's not the hotel's fault though.  I travelled on my own and felt very safe walking to and from the hotel.;4
A nice hotel that was extremely convenient for our early flight out the next morning. It was a very easy hotel choice with great staff who were dedicated to ensuring my stay met or exceeded my expectations.;4
The Jane is a unique hotel, to say the least. It's an older (like, very old) apparently former seamen's hotel in lower Manhattan, right on the Hudson River, in a trendyish neighborhood. Most of the rooms are one or two person cabin-type rooms, with small single beds or bunkbeds with literally no room for much more than the one person staying there plus his or her suitcase. The rooms have several hooks and a couple of drawers for hanging and putting away clothes. Rooms have tv, free internet, and in-room safes. Bathrooms and showers are down the hall, shared by most everyone on the floor. There are a few rooms with private baths which are much more spacious. The lobby is smallish, but there is a nice bar within the premises which is extremely popular with a young crowd,;4
The hotel was in very good condition. The views of the surrounding area were fantastic on the South side of the hotel. We were in a corner room on the 18th floor with a view of Universal Studios and City Walk. Service was most excellent. I was disappointed with the Restaurant and only ate breakfast there once. The Bar and other Lobby facilities were outstanding. So easy to get to and from Universal City Walk either by walking or by bus. If youâre staying in Universal City I wouldn't stay anywhere else.;4
Stayed four nights on business. Excellent location a short walk from Waterloo mainline and tube and plenty of places to eat on the Southbank. Itâs a big hotel, so I did wonder if there might be a lot of noise from guests coming and going at all hours, but I didnât hear any noise. Bedroom was a good size, with a comfy bed. Bathroom was always cold and the water in the sink never really got hot, although temperature of the shower was okay. Standard Premier Inn breakfast and lots of staff about if one had any questions. I may well use this as a base next time I go to London in my own time.;4
"This hotel in nothing fancy;  but the critical reviews don't match my experience.  The room a nd corridors were clean, beds comfortable.  Bath small but clean and everything worked.  The neighborhood is a standard ethnic neighborhood in LA.   Price very low for that part of LA.   Excellent metro access . Parking charge normal for the city.  One caveat: breakfast is not available and no nearby options so far zSi could tell.";4
Going to see my son in the Silver Lake area of LA on a quick trip, I did not want to spend a lot of time stuck in traffic going back and forth to a hotel. Hollywood Hotel was the perfect choice as it was only 5min drive time to my son's apt. I requested an early check-in as we arrived on a early morning flight from the east coast and were exhausted. The hotel did not appear busy or crowded when we got there at approx 1130am. We were told that only one of our two reserved rooms was ready (that one being on the ground floor very near to front lobby and with construction going on next to it on adjoining room)..I asked for two rooms next to each other..then we were told it would be at minimum 1:30p before the rooms would be ready..we were finally given rooms at a little after;4
Good budget hotel. I got a clean room with  a clean bathroom. Great location opposite central park and near a metro station. If you have a short visit and travelling alone or in couple, great place to sleep. Room are pretty small and service is minimal.;4
We just went to NYC, April 2003 and our stay was wonderful.  Although the room was small, it was immaculate and compfortable. The location is excellent, close to everything you want. The staff was friendly and courteous. The free continental breakfast was a real plus, I was impressed. The price for this New York hotel was fantastic. I will definately be going back.;4
Lobby & bar areas were great for hanging out with friends.  Fantastic neighborhood is easily accessible with several great restaurants on the same block. Only drawback was the tiny bathroom in the room, but that's just one of the perks of nearly any NYC hotel room.;4
I stay here for business vs. the Sheraton, which is next door, because it seems more quiet and more for business travelers than families.  It is within walking distance of the Universal studio lots and theme park, which means I do not have to drive anywhere, and I can just head up to City Walk for dinner and entertainment.  However, I guess you do need a car if you want to go anywhere else.   Hotel staff are friendly, but seem to be limited in what they can offer in way of discounts, etc. for hotel rooms, even when reservations are messed up.  (Perhaps the Sheraton staff is more flexible??)  Gym is small but never busy. Equipment in good shape. Pool is small, but lots of seating.  OVerall, a nice place for a short stay.;4
First, you have to know what you're getting into here. My friend recommended The Jane to me and told me up front the rooms are tiny and the bathrooms are shared. So, that set my expectation. He also recommended I get a floor higher up to help avoid noise from the lobby and the street, so I requested that before I checked in and was accommodated.  With that said, I heart the Jane. I will stay here again. Absolutely. Yes, the rooms are small. Sorry. Are you in NYC to chill in a hotel room? If you are, I feel sorry for you. You don't come to NYC to sit in a hotel room. It's comfortable, the bottled water is great, free, and you can keep the bottle for $30 (which I'm doing - it's so awesome). The room service is cheaper than other hotels and yummy. The bathrooms ARE shared but still;4
Stayed for 1 night in April in a suite.  Gorgeous hotel, the room was stunning and super quiet. It was really modern, fresh and everything was really stunning.  The bathroom was lovely and the shampoos etc were great quality too.  The breakfast was lovely too.  Staff were really friendly at check in, the only disappointing thing was that they didnât mention we had breakfast included in our booking, it was lucky that I went back down to ask and I was then informed that yes I did have breakfast included and given the vouchers. These really should have been given to me at check in, especially at the cost of the suite. Its almost like they were trying to get away with not giving us the breakfast we already paid for.  Other than that, it was really lovely, would definitely return!;4
I'm a stand up comedian that was in town doing a gig. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and frankly...in NYC, you have one of the most populated cities in the world. The space is limited and it's a year-round tourist attraction.  The room my boyfriend and I stayed in was big for NYC standards. The sheets were clean. The room was clean. We had an alarm clock that worked. We had cable in the room.  It was quiet...and most importantly, the staff was exceptionally friendly.  The location was a bit of a trek in regards to where the comedy club was (Caroline's in the theatre district) but having lived in NYC before, it was no big deal...I just took the subway down to the club.  In NYC, you should expect to walk.  I would definetely recommend this hotel to friends that want to;4
"Pretty good budget stay while in NYC; considering summertime and all! Gotta check it out!  The neighborhood is awesome, very cheap options for eating, drinking and even meeting some celebreties! The room was alright, not the fanciest, but I wonder if there's any better option, pricewise, in Manhattan today!";4
I'm in NYC once every couple of months for some business and some pleasure. If I'm going to have time, I get tickets to a show, plan on a nice dinner and then afterward retire to a room at the New Yorker.  I've stayed at other places, and they're fine. Really. But for me, the New Yorker is just a step above. From the front entrance, the beautiful lobby, a helpful concierge and some very nice front desk people. I always get a room with an Empire view, there's something about opening up that window, having a glass of wine and just knowing you are truly in New York City. The Hudson view is fine, a metro view is ok, but nothing says NYC like that Empire State building.   My room is always spotless, the shower is powerful and hot, the location to various show venues around Broadway;4
"The Empire was a nice surprise! Our room was clean and neat. Yes, a little small, but aren't most hotels in NYC? The front desk went above and beyond with accommodations. A special shout-out to Jose for being so helpful and patient. The bartenders were friendly. The doormen were able to help with navigation questions. With Lincoln Center and a Starbucks outside the door, how could it be so bad? My only complaints are the antique elevators; they should be replaced, and that the deck bar closed due to rain. It wasn't even a drizzle. Overall, I would recommend The Empire and I will certainly be returning.";4
We stayed at this hotel for a quick trip to Universal Studios. The hotel is wonderful. It's so close to Universal, you can walk or take the frequent shuttle bus. Check-in was efficient and parking is expensive but that is standard in the city. Note that you will be charged additional parking fees after 6pm on the date of check-out. The elevators were a little slow but the hotel staff were positioned near the elevators to assist in speeding up the process. The service at the hotel was great. The food was also really good, we enjoyed the continental breakfast, cocktails at the pool bar (beware, a can of Coke is $4 at the pool bar) and the delicious (and cheap) gelato at Peet's in the lobby. Everything was terrific. My only suggestion is for Hilton to trade out the double beds for;4
I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at this hotel. I am somewhat jaded as my Los Angeles hotels experiences have been less than remarkable. This hotel is the exception. Great location within easy 10 minute walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk. Check-in was a breeze and the doormen were helpful without any attitude at all. The hotel is tall with upper floors eliminating any highway noise below. Great views too. The room was clean as was the carpet. Nothing to complain about here as it is up to better Hilton hotel standards. The bar area had a fresh Sushi stand which looked great. The hotel bar also had an entertaining and talented piano player who actually serenaded my 19 year old son. Very fun. This is a very welcoming property/hotel. I wish more LA area;4
I was blown away with how the remodel of this hotel gave it new life.  Prior it old and run down.  Now it is alive and full of life.  The rooms were amazing from the shower only to the bed comfort, size of room, and layout.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  This hotel works best if you have a early flight or layover for a flight, as it is across the street from lax.  Walking is much fast then the hotel shuttle due to the traffic at lax.   The day I was there the lines were long ( 10 to 12 people waiting to check in) to check in with only 2 agents to do the check in.  That was really the only down side to my stay.;4
In the heart of tourist area which is very convenient.  Lovely big rooms. Would be nice to have a kitchenette to make it perfect!  Check in staff were very efficient despite there being lots of people checking in at the same time.;4
Just came back from a fantastic trip with my daughter and my niece. A big of the fantastic part is definitly the hotel. The only negative thing that I agree with other guests is that the rooms are quite small, but how much time do you spend in the room when you are in manhattan?!? The sleeping quality is excellent and that's more important! When we needed something from the housekeeper or the concierge we got it right away. The bathroom is ok, could be much better if you could close when taking a shower, instead of having water splashing out. If I go back to N Y, I will definitly choose this hotel again. The location is perfect, close to shopping, starbucks, central park........and many other things. I want to thank Zuli for a friendly and superservice, for all the information;4
Pros: friendly staff, close to LAX connected with a reliable shuttle bus.  Cons: Even though the hotel is new our room showed already wear and tear. Carpets in hall way was dirty etc. Windows while double insulated look ugly! Not to hear views, in fact.;4
This is a nice hotel.  This is my second time to stay here, and am a bit biased being a Hilton Honors member.  The room is clean and up to date.  The beds are comfortable, and service is great.  Staff are always helpful and make you feel at home.   I booked directly with the hotel.  My bad on that.  I am here on business.  Others i spoke with paid much less.  I should have booked through Expedia or other third party, and could have saved $100 plus a night.  Bugs me a bit to book directly with the hotel and pay more for it.;4
I love the area and all of the existing architectural beautiful buildings. The hotel itself is very nice and the staff is also. All around the whole area is plenty to do. From shopping to eating to dancing the night away. Also very comfortable rooms. Recommend.;4
I visited with my now fiancÃ© (after proposing on the Brooklyn Bridge during our stay) and we absolutely LOVED this hotel as it was clean, friendly and in an excellent location. We stayed on the 37th floor with a view of the Empire State and wider city which made the stay so much more enjoyable as we were greeted by sunrise through the city skyline in the morning and a lit up Empire state by night.   We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel as we were busy being tourists everyday but we did eat breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner and the food was lovely (strawberry pancakes in particular!). The hotel have staff by the elevator 24/7 to ensure strangers can't wander in which I thought was a good touch. The building it's self is a traditional 1930's design so don't expect ultra;4
The hotel had all that I expected, but nothing more.  It was very nice, but not special. You'll get what you paid for, but nothing better than any other similarly priced hotel. Basically, a plain vanilla nice hotel without the wow factor.  Nothing wrong with that, I guess.;4
The Empire is a beautiful hotel with a great location. The only problem was that the heat was WAY to high in the room at night and couldn't get it to turn off. Had to open windows. Otherwise we had a lovely experience. The deluxe room is very comfortable, and the both bars are really fun! The staff is really nice. Rudy at the front desk was AWESOME!;4
I stayed at the Empire for one night. I was doing biz in NYC at Lincoln Center. The Empire is RIGHT across the street from there, so it was easy. The rate was excellent, the room was clean, and there is a great little bar/gathering area in the lobby. The front desk staff was extremely polite and helpful.   The only thing that I could say would be that the bathrooms are a little bit small. If I were there longer, or if there were 2 people sharing the room, it may have been a little small (most rooms in NYC are on the smaller side, anyway). The rate and the funkiness of the place AND the fact that it was extremely close to where I was working made up for that.  Would definitely stay there again, and would definitely recommend to a friend or colleague.;4
I just returned from a weekend in NYC with 3 teenagers to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday and stayed at the Empire. The lobby is beautiful and the location is great. We had been upgraded to a deluxe double and were told it had a beautiful view of Lincoln Center. When we got to our room we had no view and the set up of the room was very strange with a column in the middle of the room. I called down and was told that we could switch rooms tomorrow but nothing was available that night. I was fine with that until I saw how small the bathroom was. I think it is quite possibly the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. This was a little bit of a problem with three teens. Also the showers do not have a door so the water tends to spray out of the shower and all over the;4
Arrived here for a birthday treat.  Checked in fine, although the lady on the desk was not too friendly.  We were on the 20th floor and it was very noisy and there was a draft coming through the windows, the aircon unit was super noisy too but worked well.  The room itself was very small but there was a chest of drawers, safe and built in wardrobe although not a lot of room to walk around the bed.  The room was cleaned every day and the cleaning staff were very good, bathroom was very clean but there was no extractor fan to clear the air.  The luggage lady was lovely and helpful and so was the information desk as they ordered a taxi for us on departure and was super quick.  The Tick Tock restaurant was good for breakfast (nice cup of tea) not cheap though. Was very convenient;4
I love this quaint little boutique hotel in the West Village. I always stay in the single room with shared bath but it's perfect for the solo traveler like me. The first time I visited it was in the summer and it was perfect. This trip it was 5 degrees outside but my room was hotter than three hells. Luckily I was able to open my window and it was comfortable. The rooms and shared baths are very clean. The staff is always WONDERFUL. The only tiny complaint I had this time was that I was a bit under weather and wanted to sleep in so I put my Do Not Disturb sign on my door. Then the cleaning staff came to the adjacent rooms and it was constant door slamming for an hour. I finally poked my head out and asked if it was necessary. Otherwise this is my go-to hotel in NYC.;4
Stayed a few nights in October and the location worked well for many attractions.  Rooms are good. Compact, clean & comfy. We had an awesome high floor view across the sunset to The Statue of Liberty.  Nice atmosphere in the lobby & bar.  Would consider staying here again.;4
There are far too many bad reviews for this hotel.  First of all, it is cheap. Very cheap. Don't be expecting the Hilton for the price that you are paying!  I stayed for 5 nights with my boyfriend. We were on the 8th floor, and had a sizeable room, which had a double and a single bed in it. I cannot fault the cleanliness of the room, and the amenities provided. The decor and the furniture were a little tired and dated, but everything functioned fine. The TV signal was variable, but I'd say we got a good 15 or so channels with perfect signal. Who goes to NYC to watch TV anyway?! The free WIFI was perfect, I had full signal and it was really fast every time I used it. There are lots of complaints about the elevators on here, but we never had any problem with them. They seem to be;4
Great location, reasonable price, Insta-worthy lobby and rooftop bar.Rooms are Euro-small, but well appointed.Only real complaint is noise coming from outside (venting system?). Very loud.Bonus points for early and easy check-in.Tip for the hotel: Instal automatic/accessible door openers in the lobby, or train the doormen to better recognize when someone using a wheelchair might need a hand with the door.;4
This is not The Standard or a Hilton but for $199 a night it's excellent, considering its in Hollywood. The customer service, from front desk to the maids to the fantastic restaurant is top shelf. Very friendly staff. The breakfast is as good as anywhere. Comfortable beds, pillows and cold air. Rooms on the small side but again, for the price I will stay here again. Jim, Detroit MI;4
Kind and courteous housekeeping staff -- especially a woman named Ana.  Very convenient location.;4
Great experience, spacious and clean room.  Comfortable bed.  In walking distance from some restaurants, supermarket etc.  Easy and fast check in/ check out.  Transportation to the airport and back and the drivers are professionals.  All I was needed after long international flight.;4
This hotel has been renovated and is now very comfortable. The location is is brilliant - near Macy's, Penn Station, short walk to Times Square. The reception staff were extremely helpful and eager to please.   The bedroom, whilst rather small for 2 people - there was nowhere to put the second suitcase - was clean and adequate for our short stay.  Quite honestly in New York you're out all day so it really is just somewhere to sleep at night.  The bed was quite comfortable but quite high - a bit tricky for a short person so I just had to take a running jump to get into it!! I love the location and will stay there again.;4
What a joy it is to stay at the Empire Hotel! The staff makes you feel right at home. From the Bellman Daniel to the front desk where Mariana and Romeo welcome you. Although the bathrooms are small, and some rooms can be tight, Monica and the housekeeping staff keep the rooms immaculate. The lobby can be a bit noisy, but the location is wonderful for business and/or holidays in NYC. A Big Apple gem.;4
The staff were nice, friendly and helpful and I think went the extra mile letting us have a late check out as my flight was later on the next day when we could not get internet service a member of staff came all the way up to see if they could help us and we shortly after were able to.;4
We enjoyed our stay at the Empire. It was surrounded with eateries and across the road access to NY ballet, the Philharmonic and Opera.  Other than a rather noisy air conditioner our stay was very enjoyable;4
we spent 10 beautiful day there. friendly staff, good service and clean room. close to the metro station. the surronding places are not so elegant but this was not a problem for us;4
I stayed at the Empire hotel for 5 nights for work and then another 5 nights with my husband on holidays. Our room for the entire stay was the Superior King Room and work paid for breakfast during the first 5 days. I have been to NY before and know rooms are small but I was still disappointed that our upgraded superior king room was so small especially the bathroom was extremely tiny! Breakfast is not worth the cost at the hotel. I ate there for the first 5 days as work had already paid for it but on the 5 days while staying for pleasure there are plenty of alternative options close by.  Another couple joined us holidaying and they upgraded their room to a suite. The suite was fantastic and if you can afford the extra $s and are staying in NY for a week then the extra room is;4
My friend and I needed a place to stay at the last minute as our free lodging had canceled on us, and I decided to call The Jane on his recommendation. When I called, I explained to the front desk clerk our dilemma, and she said she would see what she could work out. We ended up with a double bunk room about the size of a walk-in closet and dim lighting, but what more could we really expect for the price we were paying? The beds were adequate and I very much enjoyed the public spaces when they weren't being used for the club on the weekends. The location is good if you don't mind walking 5-6 blocks to get to the subway, or it's about a 30 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway. It is on a very quiet street and is very charming. It definitely has stories to tell.   My only;4
My friend and I stayed between Feb 22-27.  The staff were friendly and accomadating, the breakfast was more than contentinal.  It is close to a metro stop and the staff know the town fairly well.  Overall it was exactly what you would expect from a name brand hotel.;4
Super great location, can't get any closer to Lincoln Center! Clean rooms, comfortable beds, friendly and helpful staff! Close to Starbucks and pharmacy which was incredibly convenient! Parking was sometimes a challenge but then again it is NYC! Terrible wifi connection though.;4
Stayed in the hilton for 3 nights in June. Hotel is located next to universal studios. although perfect location for visiting universal the location is isolated so except for city walk there is nothing to do in the evening!! There is a metro at the end of the hill which will take you to hollywood blvd in about 10mins. We used this twice as we didn't have a car! It was fine but if we were staying longer I would def rent a car instead of using public transport in LA!!!The hotel was fine for the length of time we were in LA but if we were staying longer I would suggest a hotel closer to hollywood/sunset blvd. families with children visiting universal the hotel is a perfect spot! Also if you don't have a car the cost in a taxi from the airport can be expensive. We got a private;4
I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Great customer service in an ideal location for and affordable price. Not very fancy but more than functional, would recommend.  Plus notes would be Lovely treatment by all staff (especially Said and Jeff) Amazing central location Decent sized rooms (Room 814) Effective heating Complimentary umbrella use  Nice clock with added functions Other standard amenities eg a safe in room and room service  Good standard of cleanliness   Things to improve The headboard was damaged which didnât look very nice  Both lamps in the rooms were faulty with plug sockets which pulled out of the base The bathroom window was a bit broken at the top that made bathroom visits chilly One of the door handle roses was loose Some;4
good hotel, gym, pool elevator is real slow though.  hotel is close to shops and train station which is great.   hotel was clean. awesome xmas decorations in the main lounge and reception.   HUGO is the best breakfast chef!;4
My husband and I spent 5 days here in September. Had a lovely time. Hotel and room spotlessly clean, rooftop bar was lovely small but enjoyable. Would definately go back to the Empire,if we went to New York;4
Visited with a friend for my birthday. They upgraded our room and we had the most amazing view. Fresh bedding and towels daily. The room was spotless. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were to die for, could not fault it. The only downside was we weren't told there was a daily fee until we checked out and when I asked what this was for they said use of Wi-Fi and telephone calls. So don't fall for the free WiFi because it's obviously not free. We had to pay nearly $100 this was extortionate as we were only in out room to sleep. Didn't get a chance to use the so called free WiFi!!! If we had been told when we  checked in we would have been prepared. Lesson learnt!!!;4
This hotel is a perfect location for NYC marathoners.  It's close to subway to South ferry and only mere blocks from the finish line.   No need to hail a cab, along with 50,000+ other runners.  Good luck with that!  Hotel is clean and service is fiine.  On a normal day, the value isn't there as they charge for everything and the rooms are small.  Elevators were slow too..  Their late checkout is 1pm, so marathoners need a second night stay.   You would think for $600/night and $72 parking, they would cut you a break.   Considering the marathon event and demand related to that, I would definitely stay here again for the marathon.  That's why I give the very good rating.;4
Great Location!  This was our first stay in New York and the Empire Hotel has been a great choice located close to Columbus Circle it provides a nice stay away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but can be accessed in a 10 min walk, had a great view of the city and the beds were really comfy, would definitely stay here again;4
Before going to NYC and staying in that hotel, I check the reviews on TripAdvisor and was quite unhappy to see so many bad reviews... But in fact, this hotel is quite fine. The location is excellent, obviously. Next to Metropolitan Opera, with the subway in the immediate vicinity. The rooms are a little small, which can be seen in the tiny bathroom, but the phonic isolation is good, both on windows and doors, so the room is relatively quiet. It is quite old. The rooftop bar is very pleasant, the pool is indeed extremely small. One of the elevator was broken during the whole stay. The main issue with Empire Hotel is the unpleasant feeling that money has to be made on every small extra. From internet, which is expensive and slow, to the Evian bottles provided (8 US$), even tea;4
I'm a Hyatt lover! This hotel was exactly what I needed before a trip to Italy. We stayed the night prior and took the shuttle which was so perfect! Grabbed some great food that night from the deli and a couple drinks from the bar. We were able to park the car there the whole time we were gone, one week, and grabbed the hotel shuttle when we got back. Easy! One negative would be the bartender, not so friendly.;4
Was pretty impressed with this hotel, breakfast was good, room was also a decent size. Positioning was also good, not far from Hollywood walk of fame and Griffith Observatory. Only downfall was the parking, they have a huge carpark but you have to pay to park the car there...... and it's not cheap. I ended up parking the car on the street..... it's FREE!!;4
I stayed for one week with my husband and four others.  The double room we had was a little small but certainly not the smallest I've ever stayed in.  The rooms were serviced daily and the bathroom was spotless as far as I could see.  The staff were helpful, in particular, one of the doormen (I can't remember his name but he was brazilian).  The only compliant I have is that on the final day of our stay we left all our lugguge with reception so that they would hold it for the day.  There were nine or ten bags and we got a ticket for each bag.  A different door man (not the brazilian guy) took charge of them and was suitably tipped for his trouble.  Later when our limo (which the brazilian doorman orgaised for us) arrived we handed in all the tickets and were given what we;4
The location is excellent.  Old hotel, but well kept.  Polite staff.  Pasquale, at check-in, straightened out an Expedia error. Would definitely stay there again.  Good value especially for New York city.;4
Hotel is very convenient to many attractions.  Best water pressure I have ever experienced in a hotel. Daily housekeeping and security check in which I was expecting so clean and safe. Housekeeping very prompt, requested a coffee maker for our room and was probably there in 15 mins. There was no refrigerator in my room, only downfall because we brought stuff that need refrigeration and couldnât bring leftovers back to the room.;4
Second time in am staying here. Quick check in!  Room is clean and spacious for New York standards.  Shower has strong water pressure.  Hotel is dated. But it is in an excellent location and excellent value for money.;4
I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel.  The twin rooms are the size of berths on a train, so don't be bringing loads of baggage - you have limited storage. In saying that - I slept soundly every night not a bother, which is unusual when sleeping in a strange bed.    For all fans of Gotham the hotel's bar is used for some of the scenes.  It has an amazing roof top bar also which should be opened more often especially since the weather was so good when we were there.  It is located at the end of the High Line, which allows for a hassle free walk (weekdays only, weekends the walk is heaving) all the way up to the Javitts Centre.  Breakfast is on the expensive side, coming in at $51 for waffles and coffee.  But there are loads of places to eat nearby that offer much better value;4
The Jane is an excellent find in NYC. It's value for money, a unique and quirky hotel with fantastically helpful staff and all in a lovely part of town.  Close to The High Line, smack next to the river and on a clear day you look you can see the Statue of Liberty.  The rooms are snug, but then being modeled on a Ship that's to be expected. Ample storage, free water, free WiFi even complimentary robes and slippers for those walks to the shared bathroom. Which are impeccably clean and enough of so you never (well I didn't have to) wait.  Would definitely stay again, the staff and the bar downstairs alone are enough, let alone the great location and cost.;4
Very well positioned near the Lincoln centre. Concierge very genuine and helpful. Roof top bar was very cool with Manhattan skyline around you. And if you are a resident of the hotel no standing in the queue to go up to the bar. Straight in.;4
We spent one night at the Empire Hotel on St. Pat's Parade WE. We pretty much walked everywhere. It is close to the park, shopping at Columbus Circle and close enought to Time Square without being in the middle of it. Althought our room was small it was very pleasant. With space being a luxury in the city, we really had pleanty. It was also nice as a guest to have access to the rooftop Club without having to pay admission. We also had family join us with no charge. We would definately return to The Empire Hotel in the future.;4
I enjoy the convenience of this hotel. The restaurant and market place are an added bonus. Really decent for a casual hotel Rooms are clean, quiet and well appointed. The staff is so very helpful. The van driver was likewise helpful getting my bags on and of his vehicle.;4
The location of the Empire Hotel is great!! The people how work in it are allmost friendly and helpful. You can see, that the hotel isn't the youngest, but thats ok. I think we would be back in a future trip to NY.  Thank you very much.;4
We visit family multiple times a year that live in West LA. This is so close to airport with great sound proofing. Nice amenities for a casual or business visit. If you are a Hyatt Member you also can check on in via the app and use your phone to access elevator, room door. No long lines or waits with the app.;4
Great location!  We had a Triple room and double beds were very small - but ithad 3 bathrooms which was great. The decor is of a good standard. Staff are helpful - and the adjoining Diner (Tick-Tock) is amazing!;4
Stayed here with a friend in October 2014. This was a great price for a New York Hotel, I don't know what people expect for their money. If you want the Hilton...pay the Hilton prices! The hotel is right next to the subway. The lines took you everywhere around New York so it was really easy to get around.  Was around a 10/15 min walk to Times Square and all the fab shopping and shows with some great places to eat along the way. The rooms were dated yes, but they were clean and had a comfortable bed and warm shower!  The wifi didn't work in the room but worked perfectly fine in the lobby. The lift is very small but never took long to get up and down.  Reception staff were very helpful, especially the gent with the pony. He helped me call to sort our transfers out. All in all i;4
Rooms are a bit rough and poorly cleaned. Very loud. Staff was great. Location is convenient. Ran out of hot water one morning. Beer choice is limited. Door men are exceptional. Front desk is very friendly.;4
I stayed at the empire for a week. The room was a good size, but they were very hot. The maid service was very gd every day. We went up to the rooftop bar on the Friday night where there was a fashion show and it was a very gd night, just very expensive. The hotel is only a couple of minutes away from Central Park and about 15 mins walk to Times Square. Subway just outside the hotel goes straight to Times Square, penn station and battery park. All in all I was very happy with the hotel.;4
Stayed here January 2020. Mohammed at the desk was very friendly and checked us in early and upgraded our room to one with a view of Madison Square Garden. Room was pleasant. It's a few years past its prime but the price and location make up for that. Never actually had to deal with the front desk but the security personnel that checked our room key for access to elevators were always pleasant. They will hold bags for a $5/bag charge. The location here is great-very close to Penn Station and MSG. The Tik Tock diner can be accessed through the hotel lobby also. Had a minor elevator issue our first day (door wouldn't fully close/operate) but it was resolved quickly. (The elevators are divided with the upper floors being serviced by a separate bank of elevators.) All in all, a;4
If you just want a clean, safe and inexpensive place to sleep, then this is the hotel for you.  Yes, the rooms are small but I was quite impressed with the cleanliness and level of comfort.  We had large fluffy towels and big pillows. The beds were neatly made every day.  Our room was brighter than that of our children, and this made a difference.  Ask for the room at the end of the corridor (the one with the patio door -- don't worry -- it is sealed shut).  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Parking was available at a fairly reasonable rate a few streets down, at 20 dollars a day.  Do be aware however, when taking the subway at night, that not all trains function. We spent over an hour one night waiting for a train that never came.;4
"I would have given this hotel a 5 rating except for the attempt to charge us an extra $22 plus tax a night ""facility fee"", when we had already paid in full through our travel agent. After I complained they removed it, but it left a sour taste in what had been a most enjoyable stay. Apart from that, the hotel is beautiful - but then I like deco. We had a large room with two comfortable double beds looking straight at the Empire State building down 34th St. The Tick Tock Diner is a delight, and we found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The central location is ideal for the tourist. We really enjoyed it, and we would stay here again.";4
You may not think of staying at a hotel as an adventure but then you may not have stayed at The Jane Hotel.  We booked this room on the advice of a friend who'd stayed there several times in the past. I was intrigued by the history and quirkiness of a hotel designed to resemble a turn of the century cruise ship. It didn't disappoint.  So much of the original architecture is still intact and in reasonably good shape. The staff wear period correct uniforms complete with early 20th century bellhop hats. I was very impressed with their helpfulness and friendly manner. The tiny elevator has been rehabbed for modern use but maintains the original style. I have to admit the whole place reminded me of Disney's Tower of Terror ride but in a very good way.  Upon check-in, you're given a;4
Conveniently located just a short walking distance from everything in Midtown and from few subway stations that can take you anywhere else quick.  Rooms wary - from small and gloomy with no view to nice and bright with a pretty view of NY skyline. Overall experience, as usual, depends on the staff. A girl at the front desk might benefit from a customer service refresher training. But a gentleman Majid made an extra effort to make our stay enjoyable. THANK you Majid. Itâs only because of you I am rating our stay highly and will not hesitate to stay again during our next visit.;4
Literally a 2 minute walk to Central Park, 10 mins to Time Square. We used the subway a lot and Columbus Circle station is 5 mins from the hotel. I cannot recommend the location of this hotel enough.  I booked the holiday for me and my Mam as a celebration for her 60th.  Best bits about the hotel are the location (in case I didn't mention that) and the roof top bar. It's not cheap but what the heck, grab a cocktail in there as they're so good!  Only negatives I have is that I think having to pay $40 to have 3 days of wifi is a rip off. Wifi is free in the lobby but with the time difference that's not always convenient (jet lag had me awake at 4.30am) Buy water, it's $8 in your bedroom!  Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel, its noisy as cab drivers LOVE to honk their;4
A relaxed getaway with teenage kids, no washing up with a feast at an amazing price to cover everyone's expectations. This hotel had GREAT comfortable rooms, room service, staff & facilities but do book a head as the location is opposite universal studios so the rooms go fast in the peak seasons I would say it's reasonable priced but still on dearer end of a family holiday as food in the hotel is quite pricey so I would eat well at the buffet down stairs or go over to universal City strip and eat at Bubba gumps or some place like that. Over all a wonderful stay for our family thank you staff at Hilton.;4
The hotel is good value for money. Location is awesome as youâre within walking distance to a majority of the tourist attractions. Mourad the bellhop was incredible. Always greeted us with a big smile and helped us with anything we needed during our stay.;4
The location is great! Especially if you are planning on spending some time at Universal Studios or City Walk.  You can just walk across the bridge and you're there!  It's pretty awesome.  The hotel itself could definitely use some work.  For the price of a room a night you don't get what you pay for.  The bed and pillows were awesome and I had no problems.  However, the walls are SO thin that you can hear everything going on in the rooms next to you and out in the hall so it's hard to fall asleep when the room next to you is just getting back or taking a shower.  My shower didn't even drain properly!  For over $250.00 a night the shower should be draining! The customer service was average.  I saw that this location is a 4 diamond for the past several years but I only;4
This is a nice hotel in a great location.  Comfortable and clean rooms.  Helpful staff.  I wouldn't say anything about it is outstanding other than the location.  Across the street from Lincoln Center, a few blocks from Times Square and Central Park.;4
We've stayed at better Hiltons with lower prices, but this one gave us what we needed.  We were in room 1273 and had a view of the Wizardry World of Harry Potter's Castle!  If there were ever any night time fireworks, this would be a great room.  The elevators are still slow, but learn to work with it as they are doing renovations.  The tram that goes to City Walk and Universal approximately every 15 minutes is a major plus as you save on parking.  We skipped the buffet as some said it wasn't worth the price.  It turned out ok as we met up with friends we hadn't seen for years for breakfast, but next time we would definitely do the buffet!  It was endless with choices for a family who has one person who is vegan, one gluten free, and one who is just picky.  5 star luxury? No? 5;4
My sister, brother-in-law and I stayed in the Days Inn and would gladly return.  It is very close to Underground and several good restaurants.  We loved our meal at Carmine's.  Hotel vouchers were given to us to redeem for breakfast at a restaurant across the street.  This restaurant served delicious food and was friendly.  Save your banana for the man just outside.  There is a drugstore just around the corner from the hotel.;4
I had a pleasant time in NY and thanks to the very nice service of the people at Ameritiania, everything went very smooth. From the people at the reception, the barkeeper, the people helping you at the door or revering a taxi, it all was fast and friendly.;4
Nice clean property, rooms comfortable and spacious.  I like the contemporary look of the guest rooms.  Breakfast was also very good.  Customer service was a real flip-flop depending on who you talked to, some at front desk were very helpful and others just plane rude.  If it werenât for the few jerks Iâd give this property a five.  If you have a car, prepare to have to pay $27/night for parking.;4
My family of four stayed here three nights during our visit to Universal Studios and the beaches. Once you get your head wrapped around the fact that you are paying for convenience, proximity to Universal Studios, and a resort fee, it was quite nice.  The service is top notch. We arrived before check-in, so they held our bags and let us either enjoy the pool or take the complimentary shuttle to Universal Studios - which we did. A staff member was always around to make our stay more pleasant - from the doorman to the front desk to the concierge to the bellhop.  The rooms were nice - exactly what you'd expect from a Hilton. Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were roomy and well equipped.There was plenty of space for the four of us. The room had a mini-fridge which was handy, but a;4
By far, not the best hotel in New York. But. I've stayed in Days Inn's before, both in the US and UK and this was the cleanest and had the comfiest bed. Had 3 excellent nights sleep, and although the room is really (really) dated and well used, it was comfy and clean. Excellent chambermaids, they must have taken 'before' pictures when the changed the bedding, as everything was exactly where we left it, as well as folding all our clothes - they also went the extra mile and left my son's newly purchased Woody and Zerg toys hugging each other on his pillow. Bit out of the way, but we walked to Times Square everyday and it only took about 30 minutes.;4
I stayed here with my daughter Jan 2015.  The rooms were nicely appointed and the renovation was tastefully done.  I did not find the area walking friendly, but then again, I did not try to venture out without my car.  The courtyard  looks lovely in the photos, and I was looking forward to reading my book there in the am, however they never put out the cushions or made it usable.  Pool was lovely, has a surprisingly good view for the middle of the city, handy to everything, excellent parking facilities. All in all a good place to base oneself out of to see LA;4
no idea why so many bad reviews on this place. its by far the best hostel ive stayed in so far room was modern clean and spacious had no problem sleeping and didn't find the hostel or the area noisy at all;4
I have stayed in the hotel on July for 4 nights. The hotel has a central location, very big and clean. Staff were good in general. However, being a big hotel it is busy all the time. The receptionists are very busy all the time. The lobby is large and well decorated, but you can barely find a place to sit. The hotel is a little bit expensive and you have to pay for almost anything including storing the luggage for few hours after checking out. The good thing is that there is a security near the elevators which ask for room card before accessing the rooms. My room was spacious on a high floor with an excellent view on the river. The room as well as the toilet were very clean and has almost all needed amenities and toiletries. As for the coffee machine you have to call them to;4
The hostel was overall fine. Location was good and close to an underground station.  The only downside was that you could hear everyone and everything! The room (a private room on the second floor) was also quite hot.;4
The shuttle to Universal Studios was super convenient and the staff was very friendly. Our rooms were close to other family which was convenient and unexpected. The food in the restaurant was good but pricy. I guess you pay for the convenience! I would stay here again.;4
Stayed at Hollywood Hotel for 5 nights. The hotel itself is in a little bit of a seedy area. It is close to the Subway and there is a bus stop right out the front of the hotel. There are a few restaurants within walking distance.  The room is very nice, it has a mini fridge, safe, and is quite spacious and roomy for two adults and two children. There are also Laundry facilities on property a pool and a gym.  Would definitely recommend;4
"I've already stayed at this hotel twice, early in '09 while covering the Oscars for a Brazilian network and in August of the same year when I came looking for an apartment to move to LA; now my parents are staying there while visiting me. The hotel has a cool and relaxed atmosphere, great pricing and very comfortable rooms. The staff is polite and helpful, especially the man who runs the gift shop, who has given me tips on the area and helped me pick a cell phone carrier when I moved to the U.S.     Overall, I would definitely reccomend this hotel.";4
Nice hotel, reasonably priced,.Right across the street from the Met and near several good restaurants. Partking is nearby, suggest that you reserve your parking space in advance. I paid $50 for a 24 hour reservation, which was only a block from the hotel.;4
Nice hotel with shuttle from airport.  Easy check in and staff was very friendly.   I had an chef salad  downstairs a little pricey but  it was good.  Uber and Lyft friendly.  Rooms was nice and comfy.  Good selection of channels.;4
I stayed a week with my teenage daughter. The staff was friendly - our room spacious and clean- the pool on the top was very small (donât expect to swim) but quite refreshing after a day in the city.  Wifi came and went. Very cool lounge area on the roof. (White wine was served in a disposable water glass (come on ... that is a no-go at 15 usd)). But in bar area on the floor below,  good cocktails and wine were served (in real glasses).  But basically good location and value.;4
Great situation, very comfy beds, small room but as expected in NYC, very helpful concierge, plentiful towels and toiletries in the room, powerful shower in small bathroom, great hairdryer supplied, quiet room. Last stayed here after refurb when all was now and shiny - needing a bit of a freshen up now. Main areas are very attractive, cocktails are superb. No free Wi- fi but Starbucks under the hotel has;4
Stayed at Empire Hotel, due to a good deal for a 5 days. Great location to visit Lincoln Center and near by to the Subway.   Easy access to WiFi in the lobby for free.   The rooms are comfortable, but you can see the age of the hotel. Bathroom ok, but also needs some attention. Currently updating the elevator systems but only a very minor wait.   Ed's dinner next door is great with their happy hour bar menu that runs until 11:30pm.   Overall good, and reasonable price for the Upper West Side.;4
Great location - walking distance from the main gate for Universal. Note - the walk involves uphill and also steps .. not meant for seniors and/or folks with mobility challenges. There are regular shuttles from the hotel to Universal's main gate that are convenient as an alternative.   The walking distance aspect is very useful incase you need to come back for a break ( very useful for families with seniors and little kids .. the entire day at Universal can be exhausting ! )   We took the self parking option - thought the valet was unnecessarily expensive. The parking is ample, easy to navigate.   The cost of the food is atrocious :) Specially if you are a family of 4+ .. it will start adding up very quickly   Breakfast - the buffet has two price options. The server determines;4
We stayed here during one of the few days that Los Angeles was experiencing steady rainfall. This didn't damper our experience in the slightest. The shuttle to Citywalk was a pleasant perk and the hotel staff was great. There was a fire drill the night that we stayed there that involved a power outage overnight. While this was odd, the front desk crew made sure to offer flashlights to guest on request. Room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was a bit pricey, but very well stocked and delicious. Would definitely stay again if I had business at Universal Studios.;4
This is a great place to stay for a few days while visiting LA. Just over the road from Universal Studios and the Universal city walk, which I full of restaurants and shops.   The hotel is lovely. Well kept rooms, great pool and lovely breakfast. Which you can upgrade to a full buffet each morning is you have only ordered a continental breakfast.   Taxis are easy to book and the staff are more than helpful!!!;4
Even though we put up the do not disturb sign the maiden came and disturbed us. Other than that it was good. Clean room that smelled like flowers. Awesome soft bed. Bigger toilets than on other hotels in La.;4
Stayed for 3 nights over a weekend. The rooms were a bit small. Mohammed on the check in desk was excellent & helped out with all our questions & made a big difference to our hotel experience. Good location for those who want to get about both ends of manhatten.;4
This hotel was recommended by my conference organisers and after searching many sites and considering self catering apartments, I came back to the Empire Hotel because of its good rate and proximity to my conference venue. Walking distance (5 minutes) to Central Park, adjacent to the Lincoln Center and within 10 minute's walk of Broadway, this inviting, luxe hotel has many attractive features, including the attentive staff. The rooms are very well appointed, attractive and roomy enough for anyone who doesn't intend spending their days inside. The bedding is of excellent quality and if you have a room at the front you have a great view out across the Lincoln Centre and a small park near the hotel. I walked from here to Broadway, Time Square and Radio City and each morning spent;4
Had a corner room with a view of Universal Studios. Rooms were huge and a big bathroom.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Buffet breakfast was excellent.   Great location for a visit to Universal Studios. Only a 5 min walk or you can get the trolley.  Whole hotel in general needs a makeover as it seems a little dated.;4
Really enjoy our stay.  Great location.  The staffs are very helpful.  Special thanks to Krystle at the front desk!;4
Extremely well located hotel very close to Penn Station. We only used metro twice. Once for 911 memorial and other time for Brooklyn Bridge. Other than that everything was within walking distance. Staff at front desk very helpful. Rooms perfectly adequate and clean. Views over the city amazing. Beds so comfortable. thank you New Yorker;4
This hotel is perfect for anyone who wants to take a trip to New York and doesn't want to spend their entire budget on a hotel....   Likes: it is a great price, the decor is nice, very clean, safe neighborhood,  across from Central Park Dislikes: far from everything else but there is a subway nearby,  sketchy areas a few blocks away This is a great deal which is hard to find in NYC, it seems that the people who gave this place a bad review expect a lot of amenities, luxuries from their hotel, but with so much to do in New York,  do you really spend that much time at the hotel??;4
when you first walk through the main door, the smell of cleaning fluid is very overpowering.  we have a double room with a private bathroom.    the room is small although there was enough room for a double bed, wardrobe, fridge, bedside table and enough room to move around.  we had a private bathroom - again this was very small but it was clean and space enough to have a shower.   my only complaint would be the room was very hot - it would have been better to have a fan in there - the room would have been great then.    it was fairly noisy but what do you really expect, its a hostel NOT a hotel and therefore lots of young people are staying there.   I would probably stay again but this time I would prefer a fan in the room !!!!;4
This little hotel was just as advertised.  Small room, bathroom and elevator.  A little shabby, but clean with a courteous and helpful staff.  And cheap!  3 of us shared a double/twin room for $210/night, only $70 each.  And we were lucky enough to be on the 10th floor in one of the few rooms that had a little balcony.  We stepped out onto a million dollar view - the entire park with all of the buildings of midtown including the Empire State and Chrysler.  Unbelievable.  Bare bones, but how much time do you spend in your room anyway?  Recommend.;4
This was my first stay since it was renovated. Hte rooms are compact and the bathrooms are tiny. However it was well appointed, trendy in design, welcoming and well located for the Met. The staff was welcoming and helpful. The hotel was clean and well run. Would return for its location, price and service.;4
We really enjoyed this hotel.  Very close walking distance to the park.  Paid a little more for a corner room with a view of the park.  The view was terrific!!  Breakfast buffet is excellent but expensive.  If you think you will eat breakfast at the hotel, try to book a package with breakfast included to save money.  Service within hotel was great.  Pool area is shadier than I expected but still sunny spots if you are willing to move around.;4
beautiful hotel located in a great location, close to lincoln center, columbus circle and central park. connected very well with public transport. What a pity that technological system that made noise all night long...;4
We stayed here for the Rose Bowl. Compared to WI hotels, it was expensive.   They forgot to charge us for parking, which was nice!   Rooms were just fine, but not over the top. There is a Starbucks inside too!;4
Great hotel and excellent location for universal studios Hollywood, its directly over the road. You can either walk or there's a free shuttle across. But its that close its easy to walk.  Hotel check in was fast and smooth. And room was clean and tidy. All in all a good stay.;4
Stayed here for 6 nights. On arrival the staff were very friendly. Booked in Quickly. We asked for tea & coffee facilities but that never turned up even thought she said we would get it. However we spent little time In our room more time exploring New York. Hotel was warm and clean. Yes a little tired but as long as itâs clean thatâs most important to us. Bed was comfy. Shower was more of a jet of water but once used to it no problem at all. Easy to get the correct temperature for the water.  We would happily stay here again if exploring New York.;4
We stayed at the empire for 8 nights and were in room 420. We received free wifi which was great as we come from the uk and saved us having to pay to keep in touch with family.  The room was averaged sized and the bathroom was slightly smaller than expected but it suited us fine.  The mini bar is a great idea it has everything your could possibly need however it is extremely over priced.we made a point only to ever use anything from it when it was too cold to go outside late at night or during the night for a drink.  The only issue I had was when we arrived to the room from an extremely long flight I noticed there was a bottle of water next to the bed I opened it as im pregnant and was dehydrated only to notice afterwards there is a charge of $8 and the bottle of water is not;4
Meet by a good door man ( Jeff ), great reception service, room was spacious, clean, beds great ( best we have slept in a hotel) room cleaned, bed made everyday,great bar, only down side nowhere to get a drink during the day unless you go to a coffee shop, spent 5 days there will go back again;4
"We chose The Empire Hotel because of its proximity to the American Museum of Natural History (a 20-minute walk away). We were so glad we did. It's an Upper West Side gem. The statement-making lobby, hallways, and our room were contemporary and beautiful. Everything was clean and modern. Some areas did look a little worn, but it didn't impact our stay. I loved the C.O. Bigelow products in the bathroom, too. The only downsides were: I couldn't get that comfortable on the bed; unfortunately it wasn't a great night's sleep, but not terrible, either. It's also too bad they don't offer breakfast. And lastly, I was really disappointed that they didn't reopen the rooftop pool once the lightning storm was over. We only had one night and really wanted to use the pool! All that said, I";4
A well placed property, nicely done with good amenities  Good rates  well worth the cost. Except for pet charge   Which seems excessive and they do not waive for small service dogs  Good full breakfast, pool and interior court. We will use it again;4
We stayed for 5 nights during half term. Upon arrival check in was very smooth and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite with amazing views of the Empire State Building. I found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful and in particular I am very gtrateful to a member of the night staff . On our first evening my son was very afraid of being on the 40th floor and had panic attacks and was ill during the night. I went to reception at 3.30am ( it was the only way I could calm him down) and explained our circumstances and the gentleman was so supportive of my son and agreed to change our room the next day.  The following morning my son had calmed and I took him to reception to advise that he was going to try and stay in the room. Heâs only 11 but the staff;4
The pros: great service (we originially had an interior room next to the elevator, but after asking, we were upgraded to an exterior room more isolated), great decor, upstairs bar (warning, very expensive!), great concierge service, lobby is beautiful, great location  Cons: shower with no door, pay $12 for Internet in the room (free in the lobby), small room  This was my first time staying at a four Star hotel.  I was unimpressed, as the accomodatns at some marriotts are better.  I found  it on Priceline, so the price was good, but I wouldn't pay the asking price for it.  Got about 50% discount with Priceline.    Also, we were going to Newark, and there is a bus that comes directly to the door every hour, for $25 per person, which is a great deal!;4
I recently stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker with my husband.  The hotel is very nice, and very central to all Manhattan hot spots.  The Reception staff were very friendly.  The hotel is recently under going a refurb.  We stayed on the 31st floor, the room was ok, quite small but ok for what we needed it for.  You do need a high rom to appreciate a good view.  There is an American Diner next door Tick Tock Diner open 24 hrs, we ate in their for our breakfast and the service/food was excellent.  Set you up for the day!;4
Stayed here back in May, I found it after looked for apartments after realising I would be paying loads of money for a hotel. I think we paid Â£900 for 8 nights and most other hotels were around Â£1500.  We booked through the Lara Group direct.   Location is excellent, really close to a mainline Subway station and a 1 week pass was so cheap.  About a 5 min walk from Fairway supermarket which is a great place for any supplies and also very cheap as all the locals shop there.  Lots of nice restaurants around and as you are away from the main centre of NY you don't feel like you are being ripped off.  We got our breakfast every morning from a man in a cart for about Â£3 for 2 of us!   You shouldn't stay here if you want your bed made and clean towels everyday as it doesn't offer hotel;4
This hotel located at Lincoln Square underwent a major renovation some years ago.  It is in need of some refreshing.  Hallways and elevators need to be upgraded as well as rooms which were clean.  Bathrooms are miniscule with no storage space. They initially gave us a standard Queen facing a dark air shaft which was so small that there was no room to live out of 2 suitcases and had no closet.  You were supposed to use pegs but they were all broken and could not be used.  The very helpful front desk upgraded us to a Queen deluxe facing Lincoln Square.  Rooms are very dark and could use brighter light bulbs.  Great lobby and lobby bar.  Overall, if you get one of the bigger rooms I would recommend.;4
I chose this hotel because of its relative proximity to The Greek Theatre in very nice Griffith Park (about 2 1/2 miles away, up a moderate incline for last part of the walk), and Iâm very glad I did.  Hotel is clean, with a friendly, very helpful staff, very comfortable (but slightly small) rooms, nice breakfast.  Immediate area is somewhat run-down (with some homeless people) but quickly changes heading north to a very nice area, with lots of nice restaurants and trees.  Hiking in Griffith Park is excellent.  Try Starfish Sushi for excellent Japanese food and Electric Lotus for excellent Indian cuisine (both just north of Hollywood Blvd).  Hotel has a somewhat funky, charming âold Hollywoodâ feel & appearance.  Highly recommended.;4
good location if you like universal studio fun. On the way from LAX. But is behind Hollywood Hill sign. Starline tours pick u up from hotel. Rooms good, restaurant good, shopping only at universal studio. Shopping centre not near.;4
The hotel was in a nice location.  It was close to Times Square, great restaurants, subway, and many other great places.  The room was nice.  We stayed on the back side of the hotel which was nice because it was quieter than being in the front.  Some friends stayed in the front and had many issues with noise throughout the night.  Although, this is the first hotel I ever stayed at that provided earplugs for free in the room!  Jeff was the bellman to contact if you need anything.  He was incredible with any information.  He gave us ideas on what to see, how to get there, where to find good food, just about anything we needed.  He was a warm and welcoming person to see in the lobby.  He always had a big smile and good conversation.;4
The rooms are small, but you should know that before you get there. Lovely website, great front desk, the bathrooms are clean, helpful staff and wonderful old 'lift floor' indicator. Also a great location. Only thing they need to do differently - they hand keys over to guests without any request for identification - made me worried to leave anything of value in my room. A place for young people.;4
The rooms were a good size and clean, the view of the Empire State Building from the window was amazing and the museum in the basement of the hotel was excellent and free to get in.  Would stay there again;4
The hotel is great and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The only negatives are: 1. the room is too small, 2. the room is dimly lit even with all the lights on and 3. the air conditioning does not work well - sometimes it is very hot, sometimes it is very cold. We shut him down because we did not know what else to do.;4
If you intend to visit Los Angeles and would like to go to the Universal theme park then this is a very convenient and relevant option.   Numerous dining options are available at the City Walk which is either a 10 minute walk or there is also the option of a free bus shuttle.  There are numerous options to also go to Hollywood from the hotel, such as the bus tours which is just a short ride to and from the Chinese Theatre.;4
We had a very comfortable and pleasant stay at The Empire! Bed was wonderful! The bathroom was the smallest AND most efficient use of space that I have ever seen! Great shower. Beautifully decorated. Great location right across from Lincoln Center.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker 13th Dec to 17th Dec. Check-in was a smooth process with friendly staff. A security deposit was taken and we didnât have to pay the facilities fee as we booked with Virgin Holidays. If you are looking for a reasonably priced accommodation look no further than here. It doesnât have the wow factor but it does have comfy beds and clean rooms with great housekeeping.;4
If you are looking for the Ritz or even a moderately priced chain hotel, this is not the place for you. For the location and the size of the room we got (corner suite,) the price was great! The Empire Rooftop bar has amazing views. Concierge Yuri, front desk staff, bar staff and doormen were all wonderful and kind. Decor is dark and quirky, somewhat modern style but in need of some refreshing (cracked grout in bathroom, etc.) Amazing views from the corner suite. Bed was firm and comfortable, no problems setting a comfy temperature in the room. We enjoyed it here!;4
This is the 3rd year in a row that we had stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker. This time the room was not as clean as it usually is, the bathroom was very run down, and with my two little kids with me, it leads me to think I will not be coming back. Very disappointing since I love the location and that it is attached to several restaurants.;4
We stayed in this hotel for 19 days and have nothing but praise for this hotel.  The room we stayed in was clean, large and had two queen beds.  Although the girl at the front desk was unsmiling, she was very helpful and friendly.  The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Metro Subway station.  It is just one subway ride to Downtown LA, Universal Studios or Hollywood/Highland.  Breakfast buffet was ample but it never changed during our stay, but what the heck, it was free.  Free Wi-Fi in room worked reasonably well.  Toiletries were replenished daily.  In spite of reviews here, I found it relatively safe to walk around the area at night, no one hassled me in the street during my whole stay in the hotel.  It is a hotel I would definitely recommend and stay in again.;4
This was my first time staying in a Hotel in the City and it was a good choice.  I was having a gathering at their Rooftop Lounge and it was convenient to stay at this hotel.  As soon as I checked in and said it was my birthday I was upgraded to a bigger room at no additional charge.  Although the Hotel is not affiliated with the Rooftop it's still a very nice hotel to stay in.  I thought perhaps they would give me some perks since I was a guest but they didn't, the only perk I received was not making a line.  Overall it was a good stay, hotel is very clean and staff was very friendly.  It met my expectations and I would definitely book another stay.    Be aware that some of the hostesses at the Rooftop lounge are very rude and really don't care if your are a guest of the Hotel;4
Great location, friendly and attentive staff. Suite was very clean and up to par. Beautiful gym with amazing view. Highly recommend this hotel. Front desk team Jessica and Diamon are exceptionally professional and very helpful. Definitely must look for these two when checking in because they will meet your objectives and make sure your stay is more than comfortable.;4
When i found out through priceline that we were staying at this hotel the FIRST thing i did was come onto this site and start reading, which is pretty much how all my vacations start.  Of course after several reviews stating this hotel was terrible and so on, i was so reluctant to stay that i tried to cancell our reservations on MANY occasions, of course to no avail.  To my relief when we got there and checked in we were all fine, yes the neighborhood could be improved upon, well i didnt like walking at night but we were fine nothing happend.  The hotel is being refurbished as we speak, there doing alot of work to it and its looking really nice, the lobby has some couches and a little internet service nook and is tastefully decorated, check in went smoothly, but i can see how;4
Stayed for 5 nights end of June in room 321.Comfy bed , clean room with view of Lincoln centre.Work to street going on outside during day and quite early morning.Although hotel has been updated the air conditioning unit is ancient and very noisy so difficult to sleep with it on impossible without.The shower took a bit of working out and seemed complicated for a modern unit.The bar can be very noisy at times,there is a dj sometimes who plays techno music LOUD. Eds Chowder Bar has great evening meals although a bit pricey drinks are expensive,I would give breakfasts a miss as very overpriced for what you get,lots of good places a short walk away and Starbucks next door. The staff are all brill and very helpful.;4
This hotel has a ton of charm, I have to give it that. From the staff in their classic bell-hop outfits to the vintage decor to the delightful rooftop bar. It's totally gorgeous, especially if you like that old-timey feel. And for someone traveling on a budget, it's VERY affordable. Especially given that it's in such a fantastic location.   And speaking of that rooftop bar. It's amazing. I'd come up there for drinks even if I wasn't staying at the hotel. But if you ARE staying at The Jane then you really outta get up there for an open air beverage and enjoy the view.   So overall I would totally recommend this hotel! However there are a couple of minor caveats below...   Here are some downsides that I can't really complain about but you should be aware of before you book:  -;4
Would have given 5 circles but there we a ton of people in the evening but not many elevators on line. We booked through booking.com and got a great rate, then a week before arrival got an offer for  a high floor with a view for an extra $34 a night. SO WORTH IT!  We lucked out with a view that included the Chrysler and Empire state buildings. Near times Square, trains, Madison Square garden, on several bus routes and near subway.;4
Nice hÃ´tel, well locatif for my meetings and easy to accÃ¨s  Good and fresh breakfast, nice and helpfull persons at the reception desk, close to cheap restaurant to have diner  Will come back with pleasure;4
Love this hotel. I stay here whenever I come to New York. Everything I need and nothing I don't. Plus there's a pool, a private sun deck for guests, and a rooftop bar open to the public. It's got fun/luxe decor that's glam to the point of almost kitschy but is far from stuffy. And I love the staff!;4
I just recently stayed again at the NewYorker.  For the most part I love this hotel.  I always prefer an older hotel that has aged with character over time.  Thats the NewYorker.  Its probably just about a hundred years old and while updated, it still shows signs of the past.  Its old sign is visible in the NYC skyline as you enter the city but when you go into the lobby you see a classy interior that shimmers and shines.  The main elevator area has 12 elevators with some for the first 20 floors and others for the rest.  There's never a long wait for the elevator. This area is always monitored by staff checking that you have a room key - a nice touch of security.    The lobby is enormous and has tables with electrical outlets - lots of comfortable seats and couches around coffee;4
I will be staying at this hotel for the 3rd time. It is very clean, a little dated but I have never seen anything that would raise a red flag. Never seen a bug or anything disgusting. The only thing that didn't earn them Excellent is do the ancient elevators that take forever and hold 5 people. Right across the street is this amazing affordable cafe. Best cupcakes ever!;4
Spent 1 night for an airport layover and, having had lots of average/negative experiences in airport hotels, I thought this place was very good.  Excellent facilities to pass the time - a very well equipped gym with views of LAX airfield, nice pool with seating and good F&B options.  Staff were good, rooms were comfortable and newly renovated.   Importantly, the airport shuttle is frequent!  Overall a good stay, would recommend if you're stopping at LAX.;4
"We stayed here for the first night of our 14 night coach trip and what a great choice this was.  We had a room at the front, looking out over the LAX runway, but we didn't hear a thing all night. The room was modern, clean and big, including a very large bed, a table and chairs and a large couch.  The restaurant was expensive, but there was an excellent cheaper option of a ""snack bar"", with great choices in the evening and at breakfast.   The reception had iced flavoured water and Nutri-Grain bars available free.  The outdoor pool was excellent on a warm LA afternoon.  There was also a hop-on, hop-off bus, with a stop right outside the hotel and 7 other stops en route to Manhattan Beach for only $5.";4
In all a good trip. The hotel was pretty much as the reviews. Good, very clean, but small rooms. The staff were attentive but incredibly busy.  We really tried to explore the City, all the typical sights and eating experiences we could. Empire State, Statue of Liberty, Katz (Harry met Sally fame) Radio City theatre for their Christmas show (Brilliant) but paid over the top for tickets. Ground zero! Not sure what to make of that experience. Bus tour, and nearly a whole day spent in Macy's , even had a picture taken with the Real Father Christmas. Andreas Bochelli even sang for us (and thousands of others I admit !!) at the turning on of the Christmas tree lights. Time Square was ..... Time Square, BUSY. The outstanding experience was a Basketball game with the NewYork Nicks at;4
I stayed at the Empire for one night on a business trip.  I was determined to squeeze in a night at the opera during this trip, and the Empire was the best located hotel for that purpose. I booked the cheapest room available, about $170.  Generally that kind of money gets you a flea bag in Midtown.  My room was certainly small, but very comfortable.  Luxury amenities, wonderful towels and a robe, and a great bed were all there.  I don't know if there was a view, I didn't look.  the staff was very nice, and check in was not a problem.  The only thing I could complain about is that when I inquired about printing my boarding pass in the morning at the front desk told me there would be a charge.  When I did print out the boarding pass there was no charge.    The lobby has free WiFi,;4
Very nice hotel in a very great location. Rooms are small but very nice and useful. The Staff is very nice, friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. We loved it and would come back. Central Park and Times Square are just a few blocks away. We got fresh apples every day, they were placed on the counter. What a nice idea. Thank you.;4
Great location and friendly staff.  Noisy and insufficient staff/security to handle the noise in the hallways where the rooms are located or in the common areas near the lobby.   Free wi-fi although very slow service/connection. Delicious apples at the front desk daily.;4
This was the largest room ive ever had in New York. A small sitting area and large bed made my stay comfortable. The room was clean and had modern conveniences. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Finally, a great location w proximty to Lincoln Center, several restaurants, Fordham and John Jay Universities.;4
I stayed here with my best girlfriend in early July for a week, and we felt like this place really offered what it stated. The hotel offers a complimentary buffet breakfast to all guests... And hands down BEST Omelette i've ever had! Jose (the chef) that cooked breakfast various mornings throughout our week stay was both charismatic and excellent at his job. Cannot commend him enough!  When we initially checked in, it was late in the afternoon, and were unfortunately given the ground floor room that was only a short walk from the front desk. Michael (from front reception) gave us the option to change rooms the following day as we were there for a week and were given a 'noisy' close-to-the-road room. We did change the following day, and as a result, were given a top floor room;4
The hotel was very unusual and fun.  Built in 1907 it has a nautical theme so the rooms where like cabins on a ship. Our room was very small (approx. 6 ft x 8 ft) with a window looking out into a courtyard area and facing another building about 100 feet away. We stayed on the 4th floor but one night I could still hear music from the nearby nightclub. Earplugs would help if you're a light sleeper. We had bunk beds, each with it's own reading light and small flat screen tv. I slept in the top bunk which was an adventure just getting up and down.  The shared bathrooms were very clean and never crowded. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant that had a French Algerian theme and even had an alligator on the wall - it was fun too.  The location was great. We were right down the;4
ItÂ´s a nice hotel just opposite of the Lincoln Center (Metropolitan Opera, Concert Hall,...). Best place for all who attend the Opera in the evening not being an inhabitant of NYC. Bedroom was really OK, the bathroom somewhat too small. All in all we appreciated the stay in the hotel and recommend it.;4
Stayed here over NYC Marathon weekend with my mom in tow.  A great plus was the location to Central Park, public transportation, and some great restaurants.  Check-in was great (we even got to get to our room early), and the staff were all very nice (especially considering the number of high-maintenance guests they appeared to have to deal with!).  I also enjoyed that, even though they were very busy, it was also very comfortable and relatively quiet (even though our room faced Broadway - granted, emergency vehicles might wake you up, but that's par for the course).  The room was a bit small, as many older hotels are, but it was comfortable, with a much-needed refrigerator, something that's I'm always grateful for.  No coffee-maker, though there is a Starbucks right next door.;4
We were a group of 4 friends who had planned our trip for over a year. I had been in frequent contact with the hotel to ensure our stay went perfectly ie making sure we had a fridge/coffee maker. I had booked a 42sqr mtr suite but when we checked in we were very disappointed to be given a much smaller suite which was way to small for 4 for a 5 night stay. After travelling for 12hrs all we wanted to do was wash & rest but i had to return to reception and stand again in the checkin line to try get it sorted. After quite a long discussion with the checkin member we were finally given the room i had booked.  This was the only issue we had with our stay, its a lovely big hotel with great security so we felt safe at all times, great house keeping & we needed maintenance for an issue;4
I have stayed in The Jane three times now starting in 2013-2016 and I absolutely love the charm, the quirky interiors and its great location! BUT do your research! The rooms are 'cabin style' and resemble a old-school train carriage (single beds, air conditioning, Wi-Fi and complimentary water). These small rooms are well designed and have under-bed storage for your suitcase, clothes can be stored in 2 drawers and on clothes hooks.  Some people have described it as 'The Shining meets Grand Budapest Hotel' which is pretty accurate. The bathrooms although communal have always been spotless on my trips. Take advantage of the free bikes from the hotel and drift down the west side highway to see the statue of liberty or head north to central park.  Do not miss the The Jane Ballroom,;4
It was a perfect place to stay since the kids had wanted to spend the day at the park. But the hotel is pretty old and it's rooms are really dated and need to be renovated. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind staying again if I needed to bring the kids for another trip to the Studios.;4
This hotel was part of a tour with Prime Sports to see the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl. We were in an Alcove room which was large, clean and had views of the hillside. The hotel was experiencing elevator problems and are trying to fix the problem. There was an extensive wait each time you tried to use the elevators which was annoying. Even though the hotel is quite large, there was very little private setting areas where you could sit with friends, play cards or just chill without being closely surrounded. The hotel provides a free shuttle to Universal City Walk which runs every 15 minutes. They do not allow standees so several times the wait was extensive because we loaded the bus just to be told we would have to leave and wait for the shuttle to return. There is a walkway which;4
Great location to get to Universal Studios. It was clean and view was nice. Staff was friendly and professional. The beds were small and not the best- but ok. It had everything else we needed. We didn't order room service, but the choices looked great. We were just too busy exploring the city to eat there. There is so much to do near and around this hotel. It was a great choice for us. They could update the decor, but all in all it was very nice.;4
If it weren't for a miscommunication issue at front desk about early check in time and costs we would of rated our stay a 5 but overall great hotel with a delicious breakfast made to order omelets. We definitely enjoy our stay.;4
What a find. ..slap bang in the middle of the action with eateries for breakfast, lunch and evening meal on site. Food delicious and reasonable and incredibly hard working, diligent staff, regardless of how busy they get. Free toiletries too, just the thing for a deep bath and hardcore shower that felt like an Indian Head massage. The rooms are ample in size as was the Queen size bed. Comfy pillows and crisp white sheets and towels, just the thing after 4 days NYC sightseeing. My daughter met us with the shiny new son in law, they stayed for 2 nights and got 40% off so there are discounts to be had. I'd have given it 5 if we had been given bottles of water and the decor had been a little more upmarket but all in all a marvellous art deco building, complete with gym...thank you;4
Other then the elevator being creepy this place is cozy, cute, awesome location! The staff was friendly and the bathroom was always clean. I was there over New Years Eve and the price was REALLY good! Compared to an extended stay room that was going for $1000 a night. I think I paid $110 a night for the Jane. I would stay here again!;4
The hotel is very good,clean and the stuff are very friendly.The location is convinced, it is next to the subway station, we can easily acess to the downtown or Hollywood, universal studio.... Well it is a good experience stay at the Hollywood hotel.;4
After reading many mixed reviews I was a little apprehensive on arrival.   On arrival we were advised that our two rooms had been upgraded due to my mums 60th birthday. The view was brilliant. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. The room was clean. A normal sized room for a NYC hotel room.  Our rooms were cleaned daily and we always had fresh towels.  There is a restaurant called Tik Tok in the same building. This is great for breakfast or a late night snack.  My only con with the hotel was that there were no hot drink facilities within the room. If you want a kettle there is a $25 a day charge. There is a Starbucks right opposite the hotel that is cheaper each day.  The hotel is within easy reach of time square a stones throw from Maddison square garden.  I;4
Being an ignorant Brit, I figured staying in Hollywood would mean hot and cold running models / actresses / whatevers in every room, red carpets on every street and the cops chasing Lindsay Lohan down every street. I was quickly disabused of this ridiculous notion as I pulled up to the Hollywood Hotel.  As others have noted, the location at Vermont and Santa Monica Boulevard looks a little iffy. You're a good bit away from the 'action' of Hollywood Boulevard (here's a tip - avoid at all costs, it's rubbish anyway) and, at first glance, there appears to be little charm about the immediate neighbourhood, with nothing but shops with metal shutters, Thai 'massage' parlours and grim bars with no windows nearby.   Apart from that, though, the Hollywood Hotel has a lot to recommend it.;4
On the rare overnights we stay in Manhattan, we normally chose to stay downtown. However we were looking for a change and a location closer to attractions we hadn't yet visited.  Empire Hotel looks like an apartment building from the outside, but on the inside is a lovely hotel with a cozy lobby, very helpful doormen, and well-appointed furnishings. My kids were super surprised when we walked in.  It is across from Lincoln Center, attached to PJ Clarke's, Starbucks is literally around the corner and The Smith, a great seafood restaurant, is across the street. You can also walk a block into Central Park.  There's a rooftop outdoor pool and deck we didn't get to experience because of the season. If we return in warmer weather, will be sure to use it.;4
Good hotel overall, especially for its location at the hearth of Times Square. Nice room and lobby styling. On the drawbacks, a little noisy (because of its location and improvable window insulation), the non-included Wifi connection (with poor access portal), and the outlets that are lacking in the room.;4
Was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Swanky vibe upon entry, great location, room was clean, posh, small. Only issue was the housekeeping was VERY excited to service the room even with the do not disturb on the door. Problem? I mean if thatâs the worst that we experienced then I call it a win.   Bed was super tough, though. It actually helped by back but my husband was in agony.   Overall I totally recommend it. Out room overlooked the Lincoln center and it was pretty perfect for our stay.;4
Clean, safe, friendly, comfortable, and very convenient location. Right across from train station so it was a super easy walk from train to hotel. Check-in isnât until 4pm, but you can store your luggage there before check-in for a small fee.;4
We had a very enjoyable 4 day stay at this hotel which has an excellent location. Walking distance to Times Square, the Hudson River and the Empire State Building and right across the road from Penn Station. Room was a little dated but large and comfortable with a view across to the Hudson River. Would stay there again.;4
Spent a night in the hotel between flights. The hotel clear  and the facilities are nice. Free Wi-Fi is a winner. Dinner at lobby restaurat was fine. Actually everthing was fine - but I still missed a little personality;4
We stayed here during a 5-day trip to NYC.  Really enjoyed having this location as our home base.  It was easily accessible to the train, a short walk to central park, and great shopping/restaurants all around us on the west side.  The hotel itself was comfortable, the staff was courteous and always there to help us as needed.  Will definitely stay here again. The heat was on high during our stay, so glad the windows opened to help cool the room a bit.;4
Did a quick day trip to Universal Studios and Hollywood. Since I don't enjoy driving back late, thought we'd spend a night here. Paid a little more for an executive level room, but was unimpressed. Save your money. As other reviewers noted, it's a close walk to Universal and CityWalk. We arrived early and were able to check in right away. Service was exceptional from front desk to housekeeping. We had to ask for an extra towel and they offered us additional soap, shampoo, and lotion.  Overall, a pleasant experience.;4
We stayed in this hotel for business earlier this month. The location is perfect for us as it was near where we needed to be for work. The lobby is incredible, a real art deco beauty! We were also incredibly impressed with the staff. It was some of the best service we've received from hotel staff in years. Check-in was incredibly smooth and fast. The gentleman who works in the mail receiving room is amazingly friendly and helped us dispose of some packaging after we'd picked up a large package. The gentlemen who work at the little coffee and pastries stand in the lobby were very welcoming every morning!  The hotel is huge and serviced by multiple elevators, so despite it being a busy time to stay, we never waited too long for one. Our room was small, as is typical of a lot of;4
Obviously a little dated but but location is excellent was able to walk everywhere. Really enjoyed the history of the building , room was very clean and as some other reviews have highlighted windows were a bit drafty but the heating was fine Would certainly use this hotel again;4
I stayed at the Empire Hotel with my best friend earlier this year. The location is great, right next to the subway - which for $3 can take you anywhere in the city/Brooklyn. Central Park is literally a 5 minute walk away, a little slice of paradise in such a busy city. Times Square was approximately a 15 minute walk away so you still feel really central.  Our room was okay, the wallpaper was a little tired in places. I'd advise taking your own water/drinks as prices were a bit steep ($8 for a bottle of water). As a traveler outside the US it was frustrating that there was no WiFi available in the room, you need to go to the lounge/lobby area. Otherwise everyone was really friendly and helpful.;4
I stayed for three nights at The Jane on a recent business trip. On these types of trips I have the choice of staying at a large and well known chain hotel, usually recommended by my work, or of finding something myself. I usually try to find a hotel with some character, that actually reflects the city I am staying in. I can't see the attraction of staying in a place with a formula that is repeated ad nauseum throughout the world. I am so glad I chose The Jane. The location is excellent, near the water in a neighbourhood with lots of good places to eat and things to do, like the spectacular new Whitney Museum and the High Line sky walk, which begins at the Whitney. I loved my room, which was furnished with real style. The bathroom, with its enormous and deep bath and great 1920s;4
We stayed here 3 nights as park of our spring break.   Pros: Close access to universal studios is definitely the selling point!   All staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean  Cons: Hope you arenât hungry here!  The Peets coffee shop is out of any bagels, etc by 8am. Plus, they only have 2 people working and it takes forever. Not good when you are running to the park. There is a Starbucks inside universal that is a better choice. I wonder if the hotel makes the coffee spot so undesirable that you will give up and spend $30 on their breakfast!!!;4
Great location for London and the sights. The hotel staff were helpful and the room was very clean and well maintained, we did not eat in the hotel however reasonable prices and it looked OK. Recommend a stay for business or a quick visit to London.;4
Very near to Universal studios and metro station with an walking distance of 15 minutes  but a bit uphill walk from metro station. There is also a free suttle bus service to and from universal studios.;4
We stayed in May for 4 nights.  The location is excellent to explore downtown and uptown NYC.  Rooms are small but adequate for a few days, and are authentic Art deco!  The Tick Tock Diner is part of the hotel and offers a genuine American diner experience 24/7.  Try the eggs benedict!  This was our second visit so we can certainly recommend the New Yorker.  Paul & Di;4
My wife and I have stayed in this hotel three times before sailing back to UK on the QM2. It is an old fashioned hotel and the rooms are a bit dated, but the staff are efficient and security is good. We found it easy to get to from JFK by using the LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) to Penn Station which is just across the road from the hotel. The first time at the hotel the Tick Tock Cafe was full so we went over to Penn station for breakfast. Time Square, Empire State, and many other tourist sites are within walking distance.;4
This is my third time in this hotel. The guys from the reception are very kind and efficient,in particularly Mr. ZÃ©. He's from Brazil , like me and he was very pleasant. My room was at 11th floor with a nice view and the noise from the street didn't disturb me. The room was comfortable with TV, amenities, safe, mini bar and hair dryer. Only the bathroom could be a little be bigger. The hotel has a nice bar and a good restaurant with fresh oysters.;4
I was a bit wary of staying in this area, but with the Metro station half a block away, it proved a good choice for me. I wouldn't like to be in this area without that - it seemed a bit scary, but I left the hotel, went into the Metro, and that was fine. However, Hollywood is like that all over these days, I understand. Inside, the hotel is fine and I felt safe. They put me in a recently refurbished room, which I found very comfortable and clean. No evidence of bugs or anything untoward, and after reading recent reviews, I checked carefully. It all seemed very clean to me. The standard of help on the desk was varied, but usually I got a lot of help and some hints about places to visit, etc. The Internet is free and worked well for me. The microwave and fridge in the room were;4
great location for Universal Park. Good clean quite Hotel with excellent buffet breakfast. Expensive when compared with other hotels that are  good enough for what we want. Helpful staff and excellent shuttle service to and from Universal. Very good Airport transport as well.;4
Extremely pleased with service and quality of the Wyndham New Yorker hotel. Also being located so close to New York Penn Station train was a bonus.;4
The hotel was great for my family! Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Close to central park and subway for easy transportation.  decorated very nicely, rooms were small but was kept clean and tidy. Great price for a great hotel!;4
I was very apprehensive going to the Ramada after reading some very negative comments. Well my fears were unfounded! My friend and I shared a twin room and it was HUGE! We both had a huge double bed - very comfortable and the pillows too. Nice little Balcony where i could smoke - shame about the view of the car park! we were not driving but we had no trouble getting around with the metro and bus stops only a stone throw away. Yes the area wasnt brilliant but it was hardly the ghetto!! My only complaint would be the breakfast it was a bit poor really, i never did have the courage to try the horrid looking egg and sausage but the waffles and crossaints and toast were good. I would certainly stay there again if i am ever lucky enough to go back to LA! Execllent Value for money much;4
The decor style is very impressive to me and the location is convenient to shopping nearby.  Its conference rooms are very accommodating and suitable for meetings.  Overall its a good place to be and I will eventually visit again.;4
Had a wonderful stay here with my family.  The room was very nice and clean, the shower pressure was strong and the employees are so friendly.  The room itself also had a fantastic view of Universal Studios.  The hotel is close to Universal Studios so you can either take the shuttle or walk.  We would definitely stay here again.  The only issue of not was that the elevators were not all working, which definitely impacted wait times.;4
The Hilton at Universal City was fantastic.  Rooms were great, staff was nice and the closeness to Universal Studios is why we booked it.  They also had a shuttle that ran every 20 minutes till 4.30 pm.  Yes it finished quite early but it was only a 5 minute stroll back to the hotel.   The shuttle drivers were always helpful and pleasant.    The beds were so comfortable and the rooms were beautifully laid out.    The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review was that the Hilton wanted to charge us $14.00 for a three page fax.  The price was $1.99 a minute.;4
We stayed there over Easter this year.  Great location, rooms are not big but ample for stay and very clean. We had a great view of the Empire State building.  Staff very friendly and helpful, tick tock diner is worth a visit.  Hope to go back next year for our golden anniversary.;4
I have booked a room with private bathroom for my mum and myself. We first had a room on the ground floor close to the hostel entrance which was very noisy, we could not sleep all night because of the door which people slammed, people shouting ... We asked the next morning to change room and the staff kindly accepted, so we got a room on the first floor, very quiet. Rooms and Facilities such as kitchens are very clean. Very good value for money  ! Would definitely recommend !;4
Hotel was great. We enjoyed the historical exhibit that celebrated the hotel's 90th anniversary. The only problem we had was the incredibly loud noise coming from a construction project on the corner of 34th St. and 8th Ave. Although we were on an upper floor, we could still hear the sounds of cutting and drilling. The city shouldn't allow these construction projects to go on so late at night.;4
My kids and I stayed here for a quick trip to Universal and the Getty. We liked the close proximity to Universal - although I never saw a shuttle, it was easy enough to walk. The self-park was far from the hotel itself, but about the same price as parking at Universal so I did not mind the $24 fee (too much). Checking in was slightly arduous, it seemed they were understaffed and we had to wait a bit. The lobby of the hotel was run down but the room was surprisingly large and comfortable. The beds were good, sheets, towels and everything else first rate. There was even a comfortable reading chair and desk. Our view was of the freeway which was actually nice to see at night. There was some noise, but not bad. The walls were thin, we could hear the neighbors. The shampoo &;4
We used this hotel as a stay over after arriving on a flight from Auckland.  The Hyatt is next door to the airport and is very quiet for being so close.  The rooms are recently updated and comfortable.  Room service was prompt in the morning and delivered on time.  The most important detail that should be learned is...they have multiple shuttle buses that run to airport.  I have stayed at other airport hotels that I always seem to wait for a pick up and drop off and many times I get frustrated and get a taxi to take me instead of waiting in a line...and waiting for another 20 minutes.  The Hyatt seemed to have a huge fleet and worked on getting everyone on a bus for the morning flights in a very timely and efficient manner.   Thank you Hyatt for not making me stand in a line and;4
Itâs located a good 10 mins from Times Square but bang next door to Madison Square Gardens and Penn St station. When I was getting prices, it was always at the cheaper end of the spectrum but when I went to visit I was quite impressed by the decor. I believe that they are renovating rooms doing 2 floors at a time so you need to make sure you ask for one of those;4
ItÂ´s in a good place, near central Park.. People are friendly... This is a renovated hotel (you can see this hotel in Gossip Girl) There is a pool in the last floor but they almost never permite to enter there... ITÂ´S A SHAME.... they should... And there is a nice bar and restaurant..;4
The New Yorker is a classic old hotel. The rooms are small like most NYC hotels, but the facilities were clean and comfortable. The staff were welcoming and helpful. Of course my fave part of the hotel is the Tick Tock Diner!;4
The hotel's got a great location, within walking distance from Universal Studios (You can also take a hotel shuttle which comes around every 15 minutes). It's also located within a 5-minute walking distance from the Metro Station, in a safe and touristic area.;4
Stayed at the New Yorker over Easter weekend.Arrived at lunch time room was ready very quick check in. Room was a little dated but very clean and comfortable. We had a corner room with a view. The room was very quite best 3 nights sleep in a city hotel ever.We will back sooner rather than later loved it.;4
This hotel was part of a BA package and chosen mainly for the location. Not expecting much as have been to NY before and found hotels small and showing their age. Was pleasantly surprised to find a good sized room for 3 of us and a tired but perfectly serviceable bathroom. Asked for hot drink machine and this was delivered within 30 minutes. All phone calls and wifi free. Diner in hotel was good and reasonable value. Opposite Penn station with the LIRR to JFK. We had a corner room on the 29th and it was very quiet.;4
Ok so review is a bit late as computer has been broken!   This hotel is a great little gem, great price and fabulous location!  On arrival we were upgraded to a room with two double beds, on the corner of the 12th floor, (Room 1201) for New York (so I've been told) the room was huge! Beds were comfy and shower was amazing! The location is literally a walk from Times Square and in the other direction Central Park!  Jeff on the door was really friendly and informative, as was Elena on the reception, there was a little confusion on checking in as they wanted a deposit of $100 for extras which we didn't know about from our travel agent so maybe making it known would save others a lot of embarrassment!  Habvier (spelling?) on the bar the first two nights was lovely, he came out to;4
Location of this hotel can't be beaten for getting around Manhattan and further afield. Just across the road from Penn station. 5 mins walk to Macy's, 10 mins to theatre district. Loved the Art Deco feel even if it was a bit jaded in parts. Staff were friendly and rooms spotlessly clean. The adjoining trattoria is also very good for cocktails and continues the 1920's theme. Would definitely stay here again.;4
Room amazing great rain shower beds very comfy. Tea coffee available free in lobby of a morning. Wifi also free in lobby. Towels replaced daily. In the heart of everything only minutes from Time square, same with Central Park, Subway easy to use. Jeff the doorman what can I say what a mindful of information worth the trip just to see him. Invaluable member of the hotel. Would not hesitate to come back here again. If I have one criticism it's maybe hotel needs to invest in triple glazing lots of noise. But Hey were in the city that never sleeps. ðºð¸ðºð¸;4
To explore NY its a great hotel, if you come from JFK just need to take the LIRR and in 20 minutes your going to be in front of the hotel, its just crossing the street from penn station. You are going to have all the attractions at walking distance like Times Square, Madison Sq. Garden, Broadway, Macys and several others on 5th Avenue.   The rooms were spacious and big for NY area and the personal very friendly and you feel safe at this hotel because they have security at the elevators, if you don't have a key your not going to enter.   Fast free internet and I arrived early and they gave me the room so can't complain, its a great hotel;4
Very conveniently located near the airport, which is exactly what we wanted.  There are very few food options near the hotel, but the food at the hotel bar was surprisingly good.  The staff were friendly and the room was clean.  Exactly what you would expect from an airport hotel.;4
My family and I loved our stay. The staff were superb in delivering a fabulous service. Our rooms were to die for and the cleanliness of our room was maintained by a hard working housekeeping team.  Would highly recommend to all!   The only issue was a slow check in... But generally what an amazing hotel :);4
