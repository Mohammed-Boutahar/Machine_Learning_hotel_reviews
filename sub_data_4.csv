very well located old hotel clean helpful staff parking very close on a parallel street simplifies a lot unloading luggage though a bit pricey even for new york50night wifi didnt work for our entire stay 3 nights very very slow elevator would definitely go back;4
nice hotel well located for tourists but most of all the staff was very efficient helpful and friendly said and jalal especially gave us some nice tips and helped with the logistics as we were on a business trip with meetings to organize do not hesitate to have a drink at the bar where the barman will tell you everything he knows about wines and spirits;4
the hotel is conveniently located near penn station its less than a 5 minute walk mohamed offered excellent customer service and allowed us to do an early check in our room had a beautiful view the room was small but we just needed somewhere to shower and sleep after doing a day trip room was clean and checkout was quick i would highly recommend;4
had a great time as usual at the hilton they are still under renovations almost 1 year now i travel for business here a lot but even though there is construction still good service and comfortable beds tvs could be a little larger the rooms are so big and the tvs are so far away it is hard to see them when they are so small;4
this was a nice hotel and very conveniently located it was not a huge room but i guess that is pretty normal for new york city it is a little bit older hotel but everything seemed to be nice and clean the only thing that i did not like was that you could not put anything in the refrigerator because it was fully stocked if you wanted the refrigerator to be emptied you would have to pay a 50 fee i could see this being a problem if you were traveling with young children or expecting to be able to put some snacks in the refrigerator otherwise i would recommend this hotel;4
this is my thrid or fourth stay at the empire hotel most recently i stayed for five nights in a quiet 11th floor room with a view of lincoln center i saw four operas and a ballet in lincoln center as well as a play on theater row and the wonderful richard tucker music award gala in carniege hall being so close to lincoln center saved time and made it easier to fit everything in i could walk across central park to the metropolian museum and back answer some email perhaps get a quick rest eat and still get to the performances in time coming home afterwards was super easy and i felt safe as a single person on my own housekeeping was excellent particularly almasa whose smile lights up the whole floor when i called to let maintenance know that the chain for my;4
the room we received was a good size for new york clean and well kept we had a view of the city which was great its located on 8th and 34th across from madison square garden 10 minute walk to times square and 10 minutes to bryant park its central to manhattan easy to travel from on the subway we walked everywhere though and found it perfectly located the tick tock diner is a real find too great food at a reasonable price;4
we went to la as my christmas present we almost where not able to go due to the prices of hotel in la the weekend we where arriving thanks to tripadvisor we found this great hotel to begin with this is not a luxurious hotel it is a very pleasant hotel at a great prices that offers numerous extras when we pulled up to the hotel we where extremely disappointed with the area and actually worried the fenced in parking lot was not a good sign for us you do have to pay quiet a bit for parking here at this hotel after we checked in and drove a few blocks north to same great restaurants go to freds 62 down the street for amazing food at great prices we started to really enjoy the area and the closeness to many attractions and things to do the hotel offered;4
we were in london for a few days and had a hectic schedule so being so close to hammersmith station was a definite bonus room was clean with a cupboard and a fridge and plenty of plug points for charging devices customer service was not great over the phone we called to confirm booking and they werent very helpful but when we arrived and spoke to them in person they were polite and accommodating only quibble is no free wifi if we hadnt had free data this would have been very inconvenient would def recommend some friends stayed here too and they also thought it was good;4
our east coast tour finished in new york at the empire hotel the location of the hotel made very easy to get around ny by the subway which is very close to the hotel rooms and staff were very good as well plus there are a lot of good restaurants close by;4
great roof deck fabulous location room was small but adequate will definately return was on 11th floor but still heard a lot of street noise maybe the windows arent very soundproof otherwise no complaints;4
we booked two junior suites king and the space in each one proved to be exactly what we had hoped for not palatial but able to easily accommodate visitors around a coffee table away from the bed itself on arrival we were shown to suites at different ends of the hall one of which had dim lighting in the bathroom which happened to be an issue for us because we were in town for a dressy event adam at the front desk was extremely responsive and kindly switched that second room to another one our views from the front of the hotel which overlooks the broad angled intersection of broadway and columbus were really spectacular including a treefilled park directly ahead and the plaza of lincoln center to the left we went up to the rooftop bar one evening and found it;4
excellent location if you are planning to cover universal studio free shuttle to the studio every 10 minutes free shuttle to the train station too if you want to explore rest of the lavery well connected rooms very well appointed and spacious great breakfast and friendly staff complimentary wifi travel desk very helpful arranged our private car to disneylandno fuss great driver beautiful luxurious car and quite a competitive price for that level of service negatives checkin was an issue we arrived at 6am and were not given early checkin despite our request during the booking process the lifts were super slowi believe some maintenance issue overall a great experience highly recommended would definitley stay again;4
we stayed here 3 nights the pricequality rate is very good sleeping in londen is expensive this is a good place to stay but expect basis accomodation kitchen room and bathroom is shared the location is perfect 5 minutes walk from hammersmith underground and bus station staff is helpfull if you need to arrange a taxi ask them you can buy coffee etc in their own shop and you can use computers television kitchen room and you can sit outside on their own terrace;4
great view of the hudson central to everywhere great diner and friendly staff whats not to likeits dated yes but clean penn station is outside the door and dunkin doughnuts for coffee your in times square in 4 mins;4
i had previously stayed here 5 years ago it was great to come back to familiarity not much has changed to the hotel it still feels very welcoming and laid back maybe the elevator doors seem a little angry though i had a deluxe king room on the third floor it was adequate in size and had everything you need during a stay however when i visited in january it was particularly cold and the bathroom was freezing as there was no heating in there overall i cannot really fault ameritania and would stay there a third time without hesitation special thanks to doorman jeff who kindly organised a ride back to the airport our driver was great and he played some cool chilled tunes on the way;4
i would come back i would recommend it to my family and friends great price for location and cleanliness nice shower heater not too noisy doorman friendly and always present at the door ready to help and very welcoming;4
mohamed who works at the front desk is incredible he was so friendly and helpful we could not have asked for better service he went above and beyond to accommodate my family we appreciate the great customer service he provided;4
we had a wonderful stay at this hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful we were very surprised when we received a complimentary basket of fresh fruit on our first night the room was large and the bedding plush the hotel is close to the metro red line which took us directly to downtown hollywood the only down side to our stay was that the double beds are a tad small if you are a big person;4
this hotel was well situated so that going for a run in central park or going to times square you are able to walk which is great in the long summer days the staff were all very helpful especially the concierge who was at the desk and the guys at the door breakfast was really good on the mezzanine level and the staff there were particularly helpful and chatty one negative was that the internet is only available in the lobby which in this day and age is a no no and most of the time it didnt work at all this is very frustrating for the traveller who doesnt necessarily want to go and buy a sim card and pay for data that you are unlikely to use up;4
overall a lovely hotel chic full of character clean and friendly only no complimentary perks they charge for in room coffee no wifi in room and no continental breakfast no exceptions no front of the line service for empire state building or discounts on your buses etc not great for family vacation but they tried real hard otherwise;4
superconvenient location to universal studios with shuttles running back and forth between the studio and the hotel throughout the day excellent service clean rooms overall a great value will stay here again when in hollywood;4
loved the hilton it was very clean and the location couldnt be better for universal the area is beautiful and the staff were very friendly and professional as long as you are aware of the parking fees upfront and incorporate them into your budget then we didnt find that there were any surprises the food in the restaurant like any hotel is expensive however for only a short distance you can go to many other locations for food too beds and everything were super comfortable would definitely stay here again;4
good location to universal studios with good city views however the room was expensive and we still had to pay extra for internet and car parking the overall experience was good and it is worth staying here instead of paying for taxis;4
the hotel is very located on the eight avenue close to the main point of attractions times square madison square garden and macys the room are a bit small and the bed as well it was a double room the bathroom needs some renovation but it is all clean and nothing major what i didnt like was on the time of check in the lady asked for my credit card i asked why she was requesting for it as i had the reservation fully paid she just responded to me that it was the hotels policy to take a deposit of usd 45 on the time of check in i told her that i was not informed about that police on the time of booking and she just looked at me and said it was the hotel policy she was a bit arrogant i think that it shall me made clear this policy so that we are aware when arriving;4
much better than we expected the room was a fair size and the hostel was nice and clean our rooms were cleaned every day and we were provided with new towels every day we had a large tv and a fridge that we didnât really use wifi was free and accessible anywhere in the building there was a kitchenette on each floor with a sink and a microwave we had read about other people arriving to find that they had no reservation so we made sure to call to confirm prior to our arrival and everything was fine the shared bathroom situation was ok there were 2 bathrooms per floor that seemed to be cleaned daily and if they were ever occupiedunclean you could always find a free one on a different floor they were never unclean for long each bathroom literally had a toilet;4
we believe this has a somewhat negative image but we really liked this hotel it has a fascinating history and is really well placed for a trip to nyc a bonus is the the tick tock diner is integral to the building and it is well worth having breakfast there we didnt have a full view window but it would be worth asking for especially on a high floor;4
we stayed 5 nights the week before christmas we enjoyed our stay would stay again originally were on a lower floor and it was loud even with our sound machine so we asked to be moved to a higher room and were surprised they had any open rooms but were moved to a large room on the 38th floor that was perfect great location and every staff member we talked to was very friendly and helpful we ate at tick tock diner and it was great super busy that time of year but they have a great system and things moved quickly we like to try different hotels every time we got to nyc but i would definitely stay here again;4
fabulous location across the street from lincoln centersmallish rooms and bathrooms shower only but that seems to be the nyc normvery comfortable bed friendly and accommodating staff we arrived very late after flights canceled from boston reasonable prices would definitely stay here again;4
is a really well kept hotel in los angeleshollywood near metro station so for those in a really tight budget or who wants to spend the most in fun lol is a great help also close by is one of the observatory shuttle stops weekends only so dont forget to pay a visit there the continental breakfast was great but is the only meal possible no restaurant service for the rest of the day altought the room had appliances so in case of a quick meal just a visit to the nearest restaurant or kmart to moven later my only real complaint the free internet service was awful almost never worked just a few moments in late night or in the morning so if you are planning your trip on site keep in mind this so printed flyers become your best friends lol besides that;4
just great i searched for a long time in hotels and finally chose this hotel we stayed there for a long time and the service was excellent the view was amazing you see all of new york and its so exciting and fun the rooms are small but very comfortable the bed is also comfortable;4
this hotel was a rare gem in a neighborhood where there were not many good hotels in the 1960s and 70swhen i stayed there in the 1980s i remember it as having seen better days but a recent stay was a very pleasant one lobby and rooms renovated and updatedrooms are a bit smalland there can be noise on 9th avenuebut this hotel is now in a prime section of nyc with lincoln center literally across the streethotel also offers 2 great restaurants including pj clarks and verdi park as well caddycornercentral park is a block awayrooms can be expensivebut with advance notice there are value deals herehotel is clean and well maintained;4
very convenient to lax being handicapped the shuttle driver let us off at the departure level the food in the restaurant was surprisingly good very convenient food availability 24 hours each day directions from route 1 are not easy to follow;4
i do not agree with the negative reviews about this hotel in spite of such reviews i decided to book this hotel for the first time and i was pleasantly surprized with both the room and the friendliness and courtesy of the staff at all levels all special requests were catered to had booked a superior king room most of the issues about rooms at this hotel must have been for the standard room in terms of small size etc i was very happy with the room size and the amenities would return to this very centrally located hotel exactly opposite the lincoln center subway station major shops and a host of excellent cuisine restaurants;4
my husband and i stayed here on a tuesday we had tickets to universal studios and picked this hotel because it was closest to the park we tried to check in a little early but there were no rooms available the lady at the front desk was a little rude and short with us she told us wed have to pay a 150 deopsit we parked in self parking which was 18 a day that was a little pricy its understandable that they charge this much because they are so close to the park but we felt like maybe they should have discounted rates for guests of the hotel after we were done at the park we walked over to the hotel to check in the man that was at the front desk was much more friendly and helpful our room was still not available so he upgraded us to a bigger room on the 2nd floor;4
booked our whole flight and stay through expedia superb location right opposite penn station and madison square garden 10 minutes walk to times square and handy for restaurants and bars we paid extra for a room with a view but not sure that was worth it as was hoping for a view of the empire state building but got a view of hudson river instead from the 35th floor quick check in polite staff then off to our room 3526 a little dated and tired television a bit temperamentalhad to unplug it from the wall several times for it to work shower ran a bit hot and cold air con a bit noisy so couldnt leave it on low at night room safe worked fine although a little small soundproofing could be better the resort fee of 30 a night is a bit of a sting in the tail especially if;4
overall i was pleased our rooms were clean and it was a great location walking distance to everything some minor issues like housekeeping missing a day of making up our rooms and our two room reservation ended up being on separate floors that was an inconvenience for us i paid for two deluxe rooms and one of them was actually a standard room not sure if they are the same price or not check in and out was simple however there was a big group of 30 that took most of the staffs attention at check in i would probably stay here again because of the location and the cleanliness concierge jeffery was a huge help;4
the staff was friendly and helpful we were upgraded to a suite and it was very comfortable and the location is very convenient when i have the occasion to come to ny i would stay at the empire hotel again;4
stayed at the new yorker hotel for 5 nights with my wife after new year the hotel is in a fantastic location right next to penn station and madison square garden its also a stones throw away from the empire state building and times square as for the hotel its pretty good its very big lots of rooms and lots of lifts staff were friendly despite some of the reviews on here room not the biggest but it was ok for what we were looking for good shower and had hot water everyday room was clean the maids cleaned replaced towels and made the bed everyday all in all a great stay would recommend;4
me and my husband stayed here for 3 nights last december i had read the reviews and was really worried about some of them and even concidered changing hotel but once we arrived at the hotel i thought it was fab pretty basic really but excellent value if u are on a budget i was worried about the location but dont be the subway is a few minutes walk away and its so cheap to use and once you get used to it its fab and will save u loads on taxis i would def stay at this hotel again;4
my family and i just returned from a trip to nyc and a stay at the ameritania it was a great location central to so many things it was clean and simple but it had everything we needed as we werent in the room much the staff was efficient and helpful jeff was especially kind as soon as we arrived he put our bags in storage until it was our check in time so we could get going without wasting a minute he grabbed a map for us and laid out the city giving us helpful tips and answered our questions he arranged for our taxi to pick us up to head back to the airport when we left and made sure we were all set i would recommend staying here if you want to be right in the middle of all the action;4
location is the best as far as eatingshoppingwatching opera musicalscircusballet and if you need bank itâs there pharmacy itâs thereall of above everything is walking distance even you want to go farther easy to get public transportations;4
the empire has a lot to recommend it perfect location the city is completely accessible from the front door if you cant walk to your destination take the subway across the street friendly helpful staff they cheerfully solve any problems you may encounter during my 5 day stay i had one inconvenience no bathrobe in my room and one problem couldnt get the heat to work right both of which were addressed immediately i kept running into assistant managers who greeted me and seemed genuinely concerned that all my needs were met the concierge arranged my transfer to the airport the doormen are awesome and housekeepingjust wonderful i was able to get in my room at 1030 am after a very early flight into ny i understand thats not always possible but its;4
this little hotel was just as advertised small room bathroom and elevator a little shabby but clean with a courteous and helpful staff and cheap 3 of us shared a doubletwin room for 210night only 70 each and we were lucky enough to be on the 10th floor in one of the few rooms that had a little balcony we stepped out onto a million dollar view the entire park with all of the buildings of midtown including the empire state and chrysler unbelievable bare bones but how much time do you spend in your room anyway recommend;4
we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as part of an 11 day holiday to california the hotel and staff were great but no less than should be expected for a hotel of the hilton brand we stayed in a smoking room and even as a smoker noticed how the fifth floor smelt like an ashtray but to be expected i suppose as this is the only smoking floor in the hotel i believe the room was large and nicely laid out beds were comfy and bedding crisp bathroom was lovely very clean only downside really was a stain on the carpet in the room by the side of the bed didnt mention it though as it didnt bother me that much breakfast was fantastic 17 for buffett and it was amazing all kinds of food fruit cereal bread omlettes pancakes bacon the list just goes on we would stay here;4
great stay at the empire staff was very professional room was very clean a nice size and very comfortable bed was very comfortable bathroom was clean and towels were thick and soft would definitely stay here again;4
modern hotel with a great location small but well equiped gym very comfy beds clean and fresh bathroom nice and polite staff noisy streets on the outside and generators on the inside choose a room as high up as you can get rather expensive;4
it was great for the money the hotel is beautiful on the inside the pool however is way smaller than it looks in the pictures and there is also a rooftop lounge with an awesome panoramic view i stayed only one night but it was worth the money;4
recently stayed here for 5 nights having taken the subway from jfk airport takes approx 70mins we found the hotel conveniently located to 96th street subway station a 1 minute walk the check in experience was pleasant we arrived at the hotel at 1pm and although normal check in time was 3pm the friendly staff accommodated us we had reserved a king room but at check in we were offered a complimentary room upgrade although the upgrade meant we now had a queen size bed this didnt deter us our room was newly renovated on the 13th floor the room itself was perfect for a couple who would only spend time in the hotel for sleepingfreshening up the bed was extremely comfortable all mod cons etc too including large screen tv spacious bathroom ironironing board;4
my wife and i stayed at the astor on the park in early february it was cold cold cold when we were in nyc and yes we did have a bit of trouble figuring out the radiator but once we were shown how to work it we were fine they even gave us an extra heater to use because my wife was sick when we were there the astor was the most affordable hotel we found on manhattan and the location was plenty convenient for us the bus line right outside the front door takes you pretty much everywhere you could want to go and allows you to sight see at the same time and if you want to go farther faster the subway is right up the street we had a blast in new york though next time if we go in winter well bring even warmer clothes the people at the astor were nice and the rooms;4
the empire couldnât be in a better location steps from lincoln center and a walk or cab ride to museums staff are amicable rooms are spacious only complaint is i wish the rooms were brighterhad more light;4
we recently stayed at hilton universal city for 2 nights whilst visiting universal studios the hotel is spacious clean great size rooms and in a great location for visiting universal studios however is a bit isolated for any other exploring we were a little surprised that as hilton gold members that despite our room being ready we were charged 25 for an early check in however after a long flight from australia it was worth it the seafood buffet was fantastic such a huge selection of good quality food available so well worth a visit the breakfast was also very good you can walk to universal studios and city walk in less than 5 minutes great spot for universal;4
i just returned from a 5day stay at the days hotel making it my third time at the hotel in the last year i can safely say that if nothing less the days hotel is very consistent in their offering and service as i have experienced in each of my visits the staff from the front desk to the baggage holding team are always friendly and helpful i left my bag at the hotel during my final day late flight home and even though i had to get back into my bag a few times during the day it was always brought out with a smile the rooms are good as well and while it is not luxury if youre looking for a comfy bed and a good shower the price is almost always right the 12 and 3 trains are steps from the front door and they have done a good job at improving the wifi;4
the hollywood hotel was a great base for our visit to la located in east hollywood close to subway station not the greatest of neighborhoods but in no way did we feel unsafe during the day or evening walking in neighborhood rooms were clean i had a jr suit which was spacious the renovated rooms were nice the central courtyard was a great place to hang out and breakfast was an excellent way to start the day the pool area out back looked nice but didnt have time to check it out parking was around 22 extra per day;4
good location near the subway and perfect for a relaxing moment in central park if you dont want to be in the crowds of midtown also good prices and friendly personnel rooms are good but not superb;4
i can highly recommend this hotel i stay each year at close to 100 nights at various hotels mostly hilton garden inn crowne plaza double tree holiday inn and some hiltons this hotel is far from perfect but it is pretty good if you are visiting the area for universal studios especially with a family the pros 5 minute walk from universal studios and city walk good food options at the hotel clean hotel with friendly service really good pool area our kids had a blast some gluten free options this was good as two family members are celiac the cons very busy hotel the hotel while clean did seem to show some wear and tear it is clearly a high volume hotel they did not make an effort to upgrade our room hhonors gold and said that was due to the hotel being;4
i was worried after reading all the bad reviews but i was pleasantly surprised when we arrived i stayed with my husband and two young sons and it was just fine for us the neighborhood was nice and in a great location we were able to walk to two different parks and the subway easily not super crowded area like times square we were on the 10th floor and the room was decent everything worked and the hotel always gave us extra towels and cups when we requested them it is a no frills hotel for the price the hotel staff was helpful they helped me with my luggage cart and took my luggage to my room upon arrival and to my car upon departure that was helpful with two young kids i took a couple extra blankets with us because i had read the blanket in the rooms were thin the;4
we booked via expedia and stayed 4 nights on arrival in la we found the hotel comfortable and clean and the free breakfast was a bonus not fantastic quality but a good range of items and i dont get the impression that us hotels in this price range really excel at breakfast generally this was certainly the best we ate where any was provided pool was nice we got a good large quiet room so im unclear as to why a previous review said they reserve rubbish rooms for expedia customers as this clearly wasnt the case for us i also didnt think the area was rough it felt a bit deserted at night but not dangerous and there are some great places to eat up towards los feliz if youre prepared to walk or drive about 10 blocks north only downside was secure parking;4
we stayed for 5 nights at wyndham new yorker during christmas 2015 centrally located to shopping polite staff good restaurant large lobby very good hotel for family however we found the rooms to be small could have helped if we had coffee making facility at the hotel;4
for my partners birthday decided to get out of the house for a short overnight the hotel is undergoing a renovation which always adds challenges for the guests but we really didnt have any issues with it checkin was our biggest issue there were two lines of people checking in and only three people working the front desk it seemed they would rather apologize for the delays than get additional people to help speed the process maybe they need to rethink that rooms were nice and clean;4
there are some negative reviews about this hotel and i recommend going to check things out for yourself i upgraded to a corner suite and the room was lovely the bathroom was a decent size the linens were great nice toiletries and pretty decor now if you choose to stay in the standard rooms they are the same size as many of the other hotel rooms in that area the elevators ran at a decent speed and the staff here is great the bartenders are friendly and the drinks are great i had a view of the city and the lincoln center that was awesome the hotel even left a complimentary fruit platter and a bottle of sparkling water in my room the first night the parking is a little pricey however there is a parking garage right around the corner where you can leave your;4
this hotel is full of activity i joked that there was a wedding every 6 minutes we stayed here to go to universal studios and it was super convenient nice clean modern rooms excellent friendly helpful concierge named luis helped us with park tickets and great advice;4
i was very satisfied with this hostel i stayed there for 5 days it was clean cheap and located in good place 5 minutes to tube station it was enough for short stay only kitchen was not equipped with pots etc;4
great location only 10min from time square staff very friendly specially jeff at the door he could do enough to help us he has made our stay so much more enjoyable i would recommend this hotel highly;4
we spent 3 days in this hotel the location is good it is not far from the touristic attractions if you have a car the rooms are good also the only problem for me is that it is a smoking free hotel;4
i and my teenage son stayed there just 4 days ago for 2 nights visiting friends at la the service was good front desk was helpful and efficient the parking staff explained the options of parking very clearly the room was clean and quiet even it is right by the airport beds were comfortable and the regency club was as good as most clubs at hyatt we took the very last flight home on the 3rd day so we stored our bags in the hotel and went back around 7 pm to retrieve our bags everything was perfect as you could expect from a hyatt regency except its actually our own fault to leave my sons toiletry pouch behind in the bathroom he did not realize it until we arrived home late at night it is a clear pouch with his name and school name in big words taped in the front;4
this hotel was surprisingly affordable for ny they could use more staff but the staff they have were very friendly and willing to help when they had time wifi in the room is not automatically included if you book thru a 3rd party and believe it is included print the confirmation the infused water and hot water in the lobby was a nice touch the bedding was very comfortable my room was dark but that is not uncommon in nyc 714 was ada compliant so the room was larger than some and the bathroom was very spacious the toiletries were a nice quality towels are skimpy but thats a small sacrifice the location is great lots of restaurants within 2 blocks easy to get to columbus circle 5th ave shopping and times square close to subway stations my room was;4
this hotel seems to have great price for the area you pay extra for parking and the place isnt cheapbut it seems to be a good value good place to stay for universal of course but also good for anyone going to tv tapings or any studio tours they are all pretty close by the beds here are very comfortable the staff wasnt exactly helpful but they werent rude they pretty much stay out of the way;4
situated diagonal to madison square gardens 15 minutes from the empire state building and 10 mins from the start of the high line walk ask for a high floor due to traffic noise beds were very comfortable the tick tock diner inside the lobby was great and really made you feel you were getting the american experience;4
our room was two double beds looking out on w 54th room was small besides the beds there was a desk and an easy chair bathroom was small but surprisingly nice i consider it just fine for what we paid most rooms look out over 54th or broadway we were on 8th floor not too noisy sleep fine lobby staff helpful only gripe seemed to have free wifi only in lobby location of course is great broadway and w 54th seventh ave e train subway station across the street about 5 blocks to the columbus ave subway station and several others the hotel is right next to the ed sullivan theater home of the late show with stephen colbert close but not on times square thats a 8 block walk to most prime theaters quick bites nearby include a few pubs starbucks;4
my husband and i stayed two nights before leaving on a vacation flight to the south pacific and again when we returned from the vacation we loved our room for the outgoing portion of our trip because it was a corner room on the 10th floor and very quiet as we had requested the room itself was very clean and appointed in modern fairly sparse decor which suited us fine we had plenty of space to store our suitcases and clothes as well as our toiletries we especially loved the unity restaurant and open market restaurant which delivered surprisingly excellent food we had fairly low expectations for an airport hotel restaurant but were blown away by the very high quality and fresh ingredients of everything we ordered we liked that the menu was short it became obvious;4
we stayed there family of 4 great hotel staff everybody is verry friendly and good location the metro is just 2 min walk from the hotel were you have easy acess to univetsal studios and also hollywood walk of fame o and the best complimantary breakfast and omlette made by ugo highly remomendedðð¤© louise isreal;4
incredibly busy centrally located hotel great for sightseeing or business base across the road from penn station and a stones throw from empire state hence the rating of 4 but brusque and officious reception staff on check in and out be aware of add on costs âfreeâ wifi actually part of additional âfacilities feeâ of almost 30 per day and then also got charged an extra 5 per piece of luggage cabin baggage and laptop bag stored with concierge for the total cost would expect friendlier service;4
very friendly staff good location nice and close to the airport make sure to ask for mimi to be your serve you will be happily taken care of we were there for author101 with rick frishman if you ever have a chance you should learn from he is the master at publishing and getting professionals togetherthe hyatt is wonderful;4
stayed there a week rooms are very comfortable and service is friendly great breakfast buffet is included hugo the chef who runs the breakfast buffet is a great chef and a delight with guests would definitely recommend this hotel;4
the staff make this hotel what it is the building is very well located only 5 minutes walk to time square or central park standard rooms are small but always very clean and well presented deluxe kingsize rooms are great size and would recommend paying that bit extra for one of these if you get to ask for a room ask for one that ends in a 5 305 4041205 as these are the corner rooms and give great views out of both windows rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels left too reception staff we extremely helpful with the bits we needed as were there concierge staff mourad said that we dealt with giving us the help we needed with our baggage and advise of where to go etc;4
the beds were nice for my liking but may not be the best if you like a softer bed but hey the pillows were really soft and there are about 6 of them on each queen bed cost of food in most hotels is generally at a premium but it was exceptionally high at this hotel i bought food at the airport of same or better quality and it was cheaper;4
the floor in 438 is uneven it is dangerous no one at check out seemed concerned we enjoyed the location of the hotel the room was small but comfortable parking was too expensive the concierge was helpful;4
we stayed at the empire hotel for the nyc marathon and could not have picked a better location for our stay the hotel is very contemporary with up to date decor and furnishings the rooms are about the size you should expect in manhattan and the beds are super comfy i loved that leopard chair in the room grrrrr baby grrrr the faux wood tiles on the bathroom walls and floors are very cool i also loved the peppermintlavender bath products smelled so good it was a short walk over to central park for race activities and it was also very convenient to the finish line of the race nearby there are several good restaurants rosa mexicano the smith where you can grab a bite to eat and a drink two thumbs up if im ever back on the uws this will be my hotel of;4
we arrived exhausted from the middle east and were so grateful for a bed we didnât really focus on how small our room was until the next day when the money we were paying didnât equate to the size of the room luckily after speaking to reception a much larger room was found which was brilliant a great spot for walking from and fair value for money for nyc the diner downstairs was a typical ny diner which was great to experience breakfast fast and good;4
i booked this hotel thinking it was closer to hollywood blvd but it was on the east side we were dropping our son off at college so it was not a problem as we used uber to move around our room was clean the breakfast buffet was great but that was the only food service available if you order in it is from a local restaurant and takes a while to deliver the outdoor pool was small but nice and no alcohol was allowed generally the overall appearance of the hallways or front desk area were immaculate and the staff very helpful some renovations were going on in the hallways but never interfered the cost was very reasonable and i would book here again;4
3rd time for me in nyc and stayed here for the holiday period i was really concerned regarding some of the reviews but honestly taking everything into account it was excellent value ive rated it 4 based on the value for money the hotel is clean and i got clean towels bed linen and anything i wanted whenever i asked all staff at the hotel are friendly the neighbourhood seems safe there are lots of bars places to grab food and other shops nearby and it is a 23 minute walk to red tube line and 510 to the orange and blue both go straight into middle of manhattan in no more than 15 minutes i highly recommend the ellington for food and drinks nearby next to the amsterdam tavern which is also good tv in room en suite we paid for which was good and a fridge in;4
stayed here for 3 nights on route 1 from san francisco before heading to las vegas big hotel very very busy but superbly located and appointed rooms have thin walls and we were disturbed the first night by noisy guests after midnight who seemed like they were in our room the hotel dealt with it efficiently and although unable to move us as they were full i think security had a word and the noise died down the day before we left i heard someone opening their room safe perhaps it was because the room we had did have an adjoining door which didnt help with the sound we were on floor 21 executive floor but didnt pay extra for a park view we were glad the other rooms overlook the hollywood hills where we toured round the stars houses and were more interesting the full;4
this boutique hotel is across the street from the lincoln centre so plan ahead and see whats on normally plenty to choose from columbus circle is close by too there is a starbucks just on the corner and a duane read next door great place to pick up bottled water and bits for your room the bottled water in your room for the coffee maker is 750 a fraction of that in the pharmacy we had a great time from the day we arrived 29th april 2014 until our last night 1st may the roof lounge which is a heavy part of the advertising for the empire is rented out to another company you access it via the lift in the entrance foyer we where on the 10th floor room 1022 had great views but just a few floors away from the rooftop and a party was held on 1st may with a music;4
we stayed here for the weekend of anime con nyc i was a bit concerned as this is an older hotel i can say we were all pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our stay we were a group of 5 two moms and 3 teen girls that were attending anime nyc from the minute we checked in to the minute we left we had a pleasant experience check in was smooth we asked for a rollaway because we had a group of 5 we needed one of the larger rooms to accommodate the rollaway our room was not ready yet so they took my number and said they would call when ready we checked our bags and off we went someone called a few hours later and told me the room was ready we went up and our room was clean and comfortable our rollaway came right up we called down and they brought our luggage up;4
good location nice room but on the street so too noisy very kind service room is well equiped but everything quite expensive i didnt use all the hotel facilities like the swimming pool bar and restaurant;4
stayed weekend leading up to christmas for an impromptu nyc visit hotel was conveniently located across the street from penn station and very close to subway macys times square ticktock restaurant was very good excellent staff located in the hotel hotel staff very professional and pleasant rooms was clean and comfortable cant beat location we got our moneys worth and then some we would definitely stay at this hotel again;4
superb location friendly staff and oh my daysthe beds and the pillows were gorgeous would certainly stay there again the only thing i felt was not value for money or justified is the 20 per night additional charge at check out you are getting nothing not even tea or coffee making facilities just a small bottle of water;4
the front desk staff was very nice maybe too nice for some peopleâs taste the hotel room was quite large i was upgraded to a corner room my room was very clean the breakfast was good 45 bucks to park the car is insane but i had no choice the walk to universal is really short which is nice;4
just returned from a 2 week stay at morningside inn june 2015 this place is one of the cheapest hotels we could find in new york in manhattan we booked a double bed with ensuite would definitely recommend this hotel for those on a budget yes it is not the most modern luxurious or fancy hotels in new york but for those who are budgetconscious and just want a decent bed for the night thats clean in a good location this is perfectly fine the location is great a quick subway ride to all the main sites and the hotel itself is very close to the 110 street subway station on the 1 line supermarkets shops pharmacies bagel shops and restaurants all very close to the hotel the rooms are tiny but i think this is normal for new york we just unpacked all of;4
stayed one night and found the hotel to be clean new furniture and a friendly staff the hotel is very near lax so you do not have to rush to catch your departure flight however i arrived on united at stop and saw a number of hyatt vans pass me by as they were full i had to walk down towards the next hotel shuttle stop near or nice hotel and would stay again;4
this was the third i have stayed at the empire hotel the location is ideal and the rooms are comfortable and excellent value for the price the staff is also very friendly and helpful i will definitely return to the empire on my next visit to new york highly recommended;4
i use to stay here almost every two weeks because i love this hotel and my business meetings were nearby these days i visit less often and actually miss this hotel as usual i was upgraded to my corner alcove room on a high floor with a great view as usual being hilton gold i received my complimentary breakfast evening snack coupons and fruit basket was delivered to my room this is a great hotel if you plan to visit universal theme park sheraton down the hill is my second choice if the hilton is not available i will continue to return here again;4
do not take the room over the loading dock unless you wish to be kept awake all night by garbage and laundry pick up and deliveries aside from that there is a good and also a goodrestaurant on either side of the property and the bar is excellent;4
checked into the new yorker april 17 2017 4 night stay 2 adults and 2 teenagers we originally had the standard metro view double room we knew this room might be a challenge for us as it only has 2 double beds1 tv and the bathroom no desk or chair upon check in we upgraded to the metro view suitea little more costly but well worth it the room now came with an extra sitting room with a pull out double sofa another tv deskchair and mini fridge this suited our family of four much better the room was clean and the view from window was wonderful out one window was the empire state buildingchrysler building all lit up and from another window was madison square garden the hotel is located in the most perfect midtown area penn station subways are;4
great location to go to lincoln center or for some great restaurants across the street or columbus circle nice staff the bed was rock hard the rooms are small same with the bathrooms the shower has a missing glass door so water covers the floor when you shower reservations through a promo sites get you a dark interior room;4
a great location to see the highlights of new york my only criticism would be that overall it is starting to show a bit of age that said it does however offer great benefits like a pool which other do not;4
my husband and i stayed in the new yorker for 5 nights in november overall i would say the hotel was lovely the room was small but spotlessly clean and when in ny you dont spend a lot of time in the room we did find it a little cold especially on the side of the room with a window the staff were friendly enough especially the cleaner on our floor sorry we didnt get his name but he always had a good morning and wished us a nice day and even commented on my husbands new sneakers lol and yes we had to wait in line for about 15 mins to check in but check in very quick after this and we were in our room in no time the best thing about this hotel is the location we got the train from the airport to penn station and the hotel is literally a 2 min walk across the street;4
staff was very friendly especially patrick thank you for your hospitality rooms were nice and clean location was great foodmarkets restaurants and subway were near so great holiday i recommend this hostel;4
spacious room with balcony great amenities in the bathroom even provided a mini hand sanitiser which i thought was fantastic always parking available in the large car park gym on site cafes nearby for coffee laundromat directly opposite the hotel nancy at the hotel is fantastic great customer service assisted with my reservation in a friendly manner prompt responses and nothing was ever difficult shes very switched on such a great asset to the hotel i would stay again purely due to nancys service and the spacious rooms;4
no problems few amnenities this and other wyndham properties offer litte in the way of movienetflix alternatives i used my tablet to watch netflix;4
the location is what swayed me to stay at this hotel as the primary purpose of our stay was to visit the universal studios theme park so i went ahead and booked requesting a high floor theme park view alcove room we arrived at 1130am on a sunday morning i was expecting to arrange for luggage to be stored until the official check in time of 200pm but was pleasantly surprised that our room was already available and ready check in staff were friendly and efficient i dont think they noted my hhilton honours membership at the time so can only assume they treat all their guests like this and what a room it was spacious clean with a comfortable king sized bed and a truly beautiful view over the universal studios theme park and the north hollywood hills beyond it was a;4
i liked this hotel overall the rooms are very nicely decorated and clean breakfast is included and is very good there is a beautiful courtyard you can sit in and a pool my only problem was with location the picture they use for the front of the hotel is not at all accurate i have no idea where it comes from if you are planning to take taxis everywhere this location is good because it is fairly central if you are planning on doing any walking i would not recommend this place the area is very sketchy did not feel safe walking around 2 girls both from ny the area gets much nicer about 23 blocks away but the one night we walked alone we encountered multiple homeless people and other questionable people would have liked to know this about the area before booking;4
my husband and i visited the empire on 11th august this year after reading mixed reviews i can say i was thrilled with our stay here on checking in we were congratulated by staff on our wedding and were upgraded to a kingsize room where we were met with a bottle of champagne what a lovely start the room itself was great not what you would expect from a kingsize room in england but we already knew that new york hotel rooms would be smaller the bathroom was small and the shower had no door but was nice enoughthe hotel is in a brilliant location very close to subway stations and around a 15 minute walk to times square also close by is central park and along 9th ave hells kitchen there are lots of lovely restaurants and bars we visited the rooftop club one night;4
i enjoyed my stay at the hyatt regency everyone i interacted with from the staff was pleasant professional and went above and beyond to answer questions and be accommodating with that being said the room was up to date but there were old stains that gave the room an overall dirty appearance one suggestion if there are multiple dirty stains on the chair just replace this applies to the carpet too;4
ideal to explore newyork from we stayed for 3 nights ok the room is a bit small but we had enough room for us both the bathroom is a bit dated but so what it was cleanand the room was cleaned everyday we were able to check in early at no extra cost yes we had to pay the extra fees but we had been told about this beforewe had no problems with the staff they were all helpful;4
clean room friendly staff comfortable enough bed if you catch it at a good price itâs a very good value great location for tourists close to crntral park and times square get a king size bed for a better sized room if youâre not from a big city not a suburb of the city stay above the ninth floor it will be quieter and the bright signs will be less intrusive if you want the whole touristy stay stay fifth floor or lower if youâre a tourist and you have leftover money on your subway card leave it in addition to your tip for housekeeping they use the subway to get to work they donât live âin the neighborhoodâ walking distance generally;4
im a former nyc resident and i visit the nyc area fairly often i stayed here twice in january 2010 and january 2011 i paid under 5000 both times and liked it better than the 5000 to 6000 rooms that i had been renting at howard johnsons in new jersey clifton parsippany the staff was much more courteous they personally showed me to my room when i couldnt find it and helped me when i had trouble with my key staying until they were sure i got it no one looked down their noses at me like the staff at more than one howard johnson ive been told that i can pass for late teensearly 20s i didnt overhear any maids screaming at families with young children to hurry up and check out a good 10 to 15 minutes before they needed to and none of the staff came into my room;4
we were given a complimentary upgrade on arrival and the room was huge2 double beds and loads of spacefantastic view of empire statedidnt get disturbed by any street noisebathroom was large and a very powerful shower free calls back to ukwhen i say free did have to pay 29 a night resort fee room was very quiet with no noise from any other guestsonly complaint was i had to ring every day for teacoffee pods as these were never replenished in the morei did mention it to the maid one day and she said it wasnt her it was housekeeping will continue to recommend this hotel and stop again we were in room 3617;4
lets face it if it wasnt for gossip girl no one wouldve known this rooftop even existed i went out of curiosity and for the happy hour after work and i wasnt overly impressed i thought it would be really nice and posh as depicted on the show but yeah they needed to step their game up although this was in 2011 when i was working right across the street but have since moved so maybe its had a makeover hopefully but any rooftop is great in nyc so gotta take it with a grain of salt;4
enough of the original building and its fittings remain to evoke a sense of that quintessential art deco new york of the 1920s and 30s emerging from the wonderful brass fronted elevators into the magnificent foyer before exiting directly into the bustle of downtown new york it is just possible to experience a flavour of those heady days however it seems that some of the opulence of the age has been lost and the hotel would appear to be in the midst of an extended and much needed refit my room was adequate as were front of house services but perhaps left something to be desired if this hotel is to live up to its location and its glorious past the domestic staff on the other hand were magnificent super friendly and extremely helpful they might be able to;4
fantastic location easy pleasant walk to the universal studio or catch free shuttle buses we had an executive room it was on high floor facing the harry porter ride the view was very impressive day and night however there was no other perk for the executive rooms besides high floor and free breakfasts even the breakfast included was continental 10 extra for full buffet i thought this was very stingy from the hotel management thus the 4 star otherwise a very pleasant stay;4
i love staying at the empire hotelthe location is great and the facilities are good however moving the fitness center 23 levels below the first floor was not a good move i am extremely dissatisfied with this move;4
stayed here one night the location is very good close to a subway station the hotel is very cool with a lively nightclub on the roof where you can skip the long line if you have a hotel key the room was spacious and clean and the bed was good the shower had a really stupid design with a half door which was placed on the wrong side so the whole bathroom floor got soaked when the shower was in use impossible to avoid as the door is placed on the opposite side of where the shower head was the service was good and staff was polite and helpful one thing though when you pay close to 350 dollars a night do they really need to charge 9 dollars for a bottle of water and 13 dollars for wifi connection each day;4
the hotel is in a great location situated two blocks from penn station when we arrived the receptionist found us two good rooms with some lovely views of downtown the room was compact but had everything we needed we dont spend a huge amount of time in the bedroom as we are always out and about the tik tok diner was our place of choice for breakfast and i chose something different every day the lobby can be busy at times but we just met our parents there and then headed out rooms were quite quiet even thou we are on a busy street and the air con was a blessing on the warm evenings;4
we had very good time great location amazing view clean reliable professional and friendly staffalways trying to help would definitely recommend walking distance to restaurants beautiful view;4
located across the street from lincoln center and a short walk to subway and bus stops you couldnât find a better place to stay many restaurants from simple plain to dressy sophisticated are within walking distance the lobby bar is very relaxing;4
im here in ny each month and have stayed at a few different hotels but have now settled on the empire its an old hotel refurbished some time ago privately owned i believe and with quite a considerable past its location is great in that its not in times square yet near lots of restaurants cafes and bars around columbus circle and the upper west side its close to the park and if you have a car theres lots of parking stations nearby the lincoln centre is just across the road and two subway stations are very close the rooms are comfortable albeit nyc small though larger than others ive stayed in the bathrooms are small and only really any good for one person at a time a plus is the showers which are real showers not inside a bath tub and have rain shower;4
the staff were extremely friendly helpful the location was close by griffith park views of the hollywood sign hollywood boulevard etc the room was spacious and the continental breakfast was tasty;4
now this is what an name brand hotel should be the room we booked was generous with king bed sofa large bathroom and a fantastic view of the valley service was professional the walk through the lobby area from the parking garage elevators to the front desk was a bit of an adventure on sunday evening as there was a buffet set up through out the lobby so we were dodging dinners with plates of food in there hands while pulling our suitcases along did not stay long enough to fully evaluate but the price we paid was comparable to the hilton garden a mile or so down the street and with self parking available actually a bit less expensive once you add in the parking plus the room here was way nicier we will definitely stay here again;4
i stayed here two nights on a business trip the location is good but definitely give yourself some extra time if youre flying out of jfk it took us more than 70 min and it wasnt even rush hour the rooms are sufficient for a good night sleep my bed was comfy and the pillows soft and heavenly try to get a room in one of the higher floors the hotel only has 12 floors mine was on the 2nd floor facing the street which meant i could hear everything going on outside yes the bathroom space is tight but then this is nyc space is a commodity ps i found the hairdryer in the cabinet under the bathroom sink;4
the room was pleasant and clean the mattresses could use a replacement but they werenât terrible we had a nice view of the neighboring hills and of universal and the city walk the food from room service was good not stellar and overpriced as room service always is location cannot be beat if youâre visiting universal studios there is a pedestrian walkway at the end of the hotelâs driveway that spits you out right at the entrance to the theme park they were hosting several events this weekend and that seemed to be their primary concern they wouldnât let guests enter the property near the ballrooms which are closest to universal even though it was pouring rain i have stayed at other properties in the area that were nicer and less expensive like the blvd but;4
hotel is located well its clean and service is friendly the doors of the rooms are thin so youll hear everything from the corridors its a bit worndown but nostalgic in a way everytime you go to the elevators you have to show your key to the doorman restaurants are good walking distance almost everywhere and subway station near overall good;4
we enjoyed our stay here and it was very good service from the staff but iâm not sure iâd consider it good enough for 5 stars because of mainly two reasons 1 the property feels slightly dated 2 unlike whatâs advertised itâs not really a 10 min walk to main square nevertheless incredible staff and would recommend;4
we stayed at the hilton in studio city california for 6 nights over thanksgiving overall the hotel staff was very friendly accommodating and helpful the room was nice and we had a great view of the mountains from our window the only negative is our room went uncleaned two mornings of our stay not sure why they did not clean it we complained to the front office and someone was sent up immediately we also had the thanksgiving buffet and it was excellent and there were a lot of food choices our waiter was excellent as well i always like to stay at the hilton and this one did not let us down;4
we were booked into this hotel following a disaster with our travel agent who had booked us into something horrendous due to this on arrival we were very sceptical and wary having travelled early in the morning and not arrived at the hotel until quite late on we were both tired and just needed things to be hassle free well i am delighted to say that hassle free is what we got for the whole of our stay here the receptionist who checked us in was very friendly and helpful and our room was immaculate facilities were quite basic but very well kept and the cleaners did a great job with room cleaning and fresh sheets and towels daily the concierge staff were so helpful to us in directing us to various attractions we had booked and i must say that the hotel is very well;4
must visit the lobby bar and enjoy great cocktails from the 1st class beverage team the lobby bar is awesome great place to realx and enjoy a nice drink and if hungry they have a small food bar menu to enjoy;4
i just completed my 3 day stay and had to laugh after reading some of the negative reviews i booked through bookingcom i had a pleasant stay special thanks to front desk staff afroza and jose i arrived on an extremely busy and hot friday morning the checkin line was backed up and the large lobby was full of people it was pride weekend it took me about 1520 minutes to get prechecked in i was very early and would have had to pay 50 to check in early so i decided to wait i didnât check my bag because it does cost 5 per bag despite the long lines the front desk people were completely professional and polite large groups of guests were staying from all over the world i ran into a group from south africa on the elevator no one complained about anything when i;4
management needs to review checkin procedures we arrived at 300 pm for check in and provided a print out of our reservation received by email the clerk spent an inordinate time about 30 min looking on his computer then departed for another 10 min upon return he filled out eight cards that he said were complimentary breakfast tokens for me and my wife for the four mornings we would be at the hotel he explained that his manager had approved an extended stay of the occupants of our reserved deluxe room with two double beds he had found a standard room for us with two double beds and the breakfast tokens were the managerâs way of expressing regret we visited the standard room and found it unacceptable returning to checkin i explained that i would have booked;4
it was my third stay at the aonthep i wanted to try something new to the south but alas at nobody could beat the pricequality ratio this time i have got a room with the view of the central park a bleakly one in january all was good as usual and i can report an improvement in their ventilation system there was no knocking noises reported by many it seems they updated valves on the batteries still there were some sounds as i use aonp only for sleeping i cannot comment on services however i never experienced any issues moreover last year when i got stuck in nyc due to snow storm i returned to the hotel where else for two more nights the girl at reception helped me to book additional nights on her computer you should know that the staff cannot;4
after we missed our connecting flight we booked a room online easy check in pros friendly staff super clean room good size room toiletries fridge coffee tea making good food at the downstairs bar and restaurant cons no free water in the room if you want to use the two bottles supplied itâs 4 us dollars per bottle unless you are a top tier member of hyatt for the price of these rooms many of which people spend just a few hours in due to delayed flights thatâs a bit pricey for water it should be complimentary;4
hotel was in good location i did not have any issues with the area 5 minute walk to the metro which was easy to get to most places the buses were not the greatest and took ages staff were so helpful at giving you tips on places to go and how to get there nice little pool area and gym great for the price brilliant breakfast;4
i dont really have a lot to say it was a clean room with a balcony really quiet room beds were comfortable and i am prone to bites when staying in hotel beds and i didnt get one lovely hotel the breakfast was really surprising as it was a wide choice and variety waffles omelettes pastries bread ham cheese bacon sausage juices water tea and coffee really impressed and tasty i would say that the hotel was in a good location but it is well known that you need a car to get around to see things which we did so we only left the hotel in the car we didnt spend much time in the hotel and i wish we had chance to try out the steam room and swimming pool but we didnt find the time we stayed there two nights and paid â£62 per night plus roughly 18 for parking per;4
i have just returned from a week at the empire we have had a lovely week the hotel is very nice and in a good location we stayed on the 10th floor with brilliant views over the city staff are all very polite and helpful and i would recommend to others;4
had a city view room on 29th floor beds were comfortable and room well equipped bathroomshower needs updating staff friendly food options around the area good tick tock diner and of course the location is perfect for the metro;4
i would give this hotel a rating of 5 but we lost our hot water on our last morning there very conveniently close to universal food is good but pricey very clean compared to other hotels near by;4
we checked into the new yorker after a few nights at another very average hotel further uptown the lovely lobby had a real buzz to it and several staff acknowledged us or spoke to us while we were waiting to check in what a great location we walked everywhere the renovated room are elegant however the bathroom was a bit small with nowhere to put your toiletries not good when sharing with another woman our view of the hudson was wonderful we were advised of he 29 a day surcharge beforehand and thought it was a bit steep however it did cover international calls so i was able to telephone australia several times at no additional cost there was also very good security in the lobby and helpful smiling service every day;4
rooms are small as mentioned in other reviews bathrooms are really small however its an older hotel and in the heart of the city very close to penn station the empire state buildingtime square etc both restaurants were good and reasonably priced nice gym my husband asked for a better view and the front desk happily obliged for the price not sure you can beat it would stay there again;4
this hotel is an art nouveau building that has been appropriately refurbished though some important items were forgotten pluming and soundproofing must be wyndhams top priority in order to become a very satisfactory experience instead of an average one the location is fantastic and is the best asset of this hotel amenities are below average and cleanliness can improve overall service is good considered and attentive;4
i have stayed in the jane three times now starting in 20132016 and i absolutely love the charm the quirky interiors and its great location but do your research the rooms are cabin style and resemble a oldschool train carriage single beds air conditioning wifi and complimentary water these small rooms are well designed and have underbed storage for your suitcase clothes can be stored in 2 drawers and on clothes hooks some people have described it as the shining meets grand budapest hotel which is pretty accurate the bathrooms although communal have always been spotless on my trips take advantage of the free bikes from the hotel and drift down the west side highway to see the statue of liberty or head north to central park do not miss the the jane ballroom;4
perfect location beside underground bus takes on time to get anywhere look up bus maps before coming to get familiar with it cheap breakfast nearby on broadway as well as mcdonalds and subway free street parking if ur willing to drive around for 20 mins to find it we had to move car twice so cost us nothing to park no internet never worked and rooms are clean but really old and well who cares you will be out walk to seinfeld restaurant from show got it cheap on rentaroomcom;4
stayed for a night on business this is a solid choice at lax it is supposedly easy to walk to and has a 24 hour shuttle the hotel is up to date and the rooms seem fresh and updated the staff were very friendly and helpful it is about a 15 minute uber to manhattan beach for lots of dining options you do hear the planes a bit even with double pane windows but it is not terrible at all all in all this is a very solid hotel for those that need to be around the airport;4
stayed here on leisure for my first visit to new york personally i loved the location of this hotel it has the residential feel over tourist right opp central park literally 5 metres from the hotel there are 2 subways within a 5 min walk from the hotel and takes just minutes to all the attractions the city has to offer if you are looking for a central location this isnt for you i loved the peace and quiet of the location the hotel is very small the lift is tiny but certainly not worth knocking any points off the rooms are very basic but clean and comfortable the staff at the hotel were amazing polite helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them to summarizeif you are looking for a modern spacious central location book somewhere else what this hotel;4
the rooms are quit big there is a mini bar iron some snacks if youre in one of the inner rooms you do hear the airco installed there the noise is always there so ask for a room at the street is if you dont like the noise for the rest nice rooms the breakfast is server on the ground floor but everyting is in plastic i find it very unpleasant to eat in a hotel on a plastic plate with a plastic knife thats for me unacceptable;4
first of all the gripes there were hair in the bathroom building work was noisy and blocked view this aside was a great hotel we said about the hair and the staff sent cleaners straight away the building work is just building work and cant really be helped but maybe a discount for the disruption would be fairer than jus expecting guests to put up without knowledge good location sizeable room good water pressure we were on top floor;4
we stayed here for 1 night while attending the dodger game this hotel was perfect for what we needed we came early to lounge at the pool then checked into the room then went to the game the pool area is nice the outside of the hotel and the hallways could use a make over but rooms were somewhat recently redesigned and modern looking neighborhood was ok not sure i would have walked around too much at night we took an uber to the game which was only about a 1015 min ride with game traffic also the room came with free breakfast which was really good and i considered a huge plus overall we booked this hotel because it was cheaper than others in the area and i was very happy with our stay would stay again if ever in the area and had a need;4
we stay here every time we visit nyc which is at least twice a year and we continue to think the empire provides a fantastic location great staff and interesting decor yes the rooms may seem small if you are accustomed to the usual cookiecutter hotel chains the showers only have halfadoor with the grout beginning to show some age and the rooftop pool is more like a long lappool but who goes to nyc to spend time in a pool you are walking distance to a lot of nyc activities sights such as central park columbus circle fifth avenue times square great restaurants and of course lincoln center for more distance taxis buses and the subway are outside the door the lobby staff is efficient and helpful and the housekeeping is exceptional two negatives;4
other then the elevator being creepy this place is cozy cute awesome location the staff was friendly and the bathroom was always clean i was there over new years eve and the price was really good compared to an extended stay room that was going for 1000 a night i think i paid 110 a night for the jane i would stay here again;4
the front lady could have been more friendly but the stay was not bad at all very small gym very convenient location free lemon water and hot tea service at lobby was nice i would go back if i can get another good deal;4
dont know what people expect for what youre paying i stayed here with my son for 2 nights for a theatre break its 2 mins walk from hammersmith underground i felt safe walking here late at night beds were comfy fridge in room aswell ideal for â£80 going back again this month actually with no hesitation;4
we really liked our one night stay here the hotel is very modern and super comfy beds we loved the whole interior of this hotel new and hip ok breakfast and very close to get to the airport great insulation of the windows did not hear one plane passing by would stay here for sure next time we have a layover in la;4
we stayed at the new yorker in late february we got very lucky with amazing weather the hotel is in a perfect spot within walking distance of penn station everything was smooth at check in the rooms are average but comfortable and the majority of the staff was helpful with the exception of a grumpy lady at the concierge desk this in the hotel are a little pricey but you have all the options near by for coffee food and whatever else you need it really is about location location location we only had a day and a half to explore and being near many of the major highlights gave us the chance to do it all we look forward to staying here again in the future;4
i stayed at this hotel for two nights for business its very nicely appointed and centrally located to hollywood for events good on site is good and theres a peets coffee for quick breakfasts which i appreciated the corner rooms are spacious and the higher floors have great views the thing to be aware of this is a vey high traffic hotel families and tourists visiting universal studios are abundant so there are lots of people all over all the time a little patience for the business traveler goes a long way;4
very cute boutique hotel staff is professional kind rooms are comfortable the location is perfect for me across from lincoln center i hope to try the bar out the next time i am there love the brand of bath products;4
this delightful art deco hotel is brilliant the decor and location are fabulous and the service is well above a hotel of this grade special mention for all porters etc youre great it seems rude to discuss the price at the bar 19 for a single whiskey a blend 20 for couscous and the size of the rooms no floor space around the suitcases as it was wonderful but my wife booked it so it seemed only right to avail myself of the facilities but i wont do that again i will stay there though every time i come to nyc top job;4
location is great but the rooms need to be lightened up most the views are other buildings so its very dark and dim even with the lights on it is a little spooky in the hallways the wallpaper doesnt help;4
great roomgood air congood services overallbathroom configuration odd but serviceable discrepancy over bookingcom bill not easily resolvedbut satisfactory overallrestaurant not usedrooftop pool very smallneeded attentionwater appeared very cloudytherefore did not use;4
great location and good standard of accommodation rooms cozy but it is nyc payable wifi i think is poor by todays expected standards enjoyable stay though and friendly attentive staff great location for the areas of the city i needed access to would recommend and will be staying again very soon;4
first visit to nyc stayed at the empire hotel staff is pleasant yuri concierge is a pleasure to deal with very knowledgeable about everything we asked him about my only complaint was that it was a booked weekend and they only had 2 elevators working when you are on the 10th floor climbing those steps every time you come and go wasnt a pleasant thought there was always a 510 minute wait for the elevator hopefully it was a one time issue rooms are small but nice bathroom extremely small only one person can get in there overall nice place and i would definitely stay there again;4
the bathroom was very small but hey you are in nyc the room was very clean and service was excellent i also liked the tick tock diner in the hotel great food very convenient to everything macys is only about a block away madison square gardens is on the opposite corner;4
stayed for 2 nights while we visited universal studios its only a 5 minute walk to the front gates of universal which has a shopping centre just outside with plenty of places to eat easy to get to other la locations from here great continental breakfast was included but for 10person you could upgrade to a full buffet breakfast well worth it we self parked our car for 28night which is very easyvalet for the extra not value or necessary here very happy with this hotel and would stay again;4
i stayed in this hotel for two nights at the beginning of june ended up on 8th floor without a view other then building next door but room was very clean and comfortable albeit small bathroom had just a shower which was tiled and nice if you are alone this is an ok hotel sizewise two people would have been cramped i think hotel has restaurant connected to lobby which was reasonably priced for nyc standards and food was good i used wyndham points to stay here so cant comment on pricing i would stay here again but a couple other hotels ive stayed at nearby in the past had larger rooms;4
we stayed in the astor in april 2007 and for the price we paid relatively cheap we cannot complain the front of house staff were lovely the beds comfortable and the room was somewhat small but fairly quiet the bed linen and towels were changed every day when the room was cleaned and the high pressure shower was superb the hotel is a little out of downtown manhattan but with the subway so close we werent moaning it was so quick and easy to get to just about any part of new york and cheap too we bought an unlimited weekly pass for 24a bargain considering how much we used it all in all it was a great base for our 7 day stay in new york the room was comfortable clean and secure we didnt come to the city to sit in our room all day i would definitely stay;4
great location and friendly staff noisy and insufficient staffsecurity to handle the noise in the hallways where the rooms are located or in the common areas near the lobby free wifi although very slow serviceconnection delicious apples at the front desk daily;4
the staff were friendly and helpful rooms were clean only downside was the cockroaches we had on our fifth night we told the person at the desk and they moved us rooms the wait for the elevators was somtimes long epecially on the fith floor as they were usually full by then but the 9th floor wasnt too bad it was good for the price would stay again;4
we stay here every year because it is close to lincoln center and other attractions more of a boutique hotel the rooms are not large and the hotel sometimes shows its age but the service has been good and it is a very convenient location its a little pricey for what it is but you can often get some good deals depending on when your going i think it is worth it overall so give it a try;4
brilliant place to stay in new york limited facilities but an over all good place to stay staff are freindly and always willing to help with any problems rooms are not very big but who goes to new york to sit in their bedroom allday my holiday was amazing and i would go back time and time again;4
stayed at the new yorker 7th10th june and loved it the location is perfect for accessing manhattan by foot or subway and we had a beautiful view of the empire state building we had really easy checkin and outs rooms are small but not to the point of being problematic and i loved the art deco design and the hotel always appeared clean the ticktock diner and hotel bar and restaurant were excellent and we always are well in fact i would return purely for the best shepherds pie i have ever had and thats saying something coming from the uk beautiful hotel in a excellent location would definitely recommend to others and stay again;4
we stayed here for a week and found the hotel accommodation had very nice rooms the staff were helpful the location was very close to the subway and complimentary breakfast was great some small issues are the street is a little rough the elevator is very slow internet is very slow;4
we stayed here for three nights with a motor coach tour and loved it it was our 1st time to nyc so we had many questions the doormen were helpful in helping us find our way to places we wanted to go doorman jeff was especially friendly and helpful the location is fantastic just steps away from time square and many other places even the soup nazi loved the breakfast bar;4
we spent 10 days at the hilton universal city and it was a great experience with helpful and friendly staff who would always acknowledge you when you saw them and were only too willing to help us with whatever we needed the rooms were a good size with no faults or issues and were maintained well great location to universal studios with a 5 min walk i would give this 4 out of 5 stars for a total experience;4
good service and conveniences just across the street from univrrsal studios can go by foot just a 5 minute walk good parking lot essential in la self parking available ttried the room servife very nice pizza for a fair price;4
the new yorker hotel was a great selection for this trip it is centrally located and its closeness to the train station and the subway lines makes it a terrific starting point for whatever activities you have planned for the day the new yorker as with real estate comes down to location location location the location was ideal and the service was equally impressive;4
stayed here for three nights the room was very good spacious but no view of city just inside the rear courtyard conveniently placed for most attractions and good bars and diners all close by tick tock restaurant attached clean well presented and friendly staff;4
very good hotel close to everything has restaurants to eat and bar to grab drinks great 24hr dinerright in the middle of times square perfect for broadway shows 1 block away close to shopping not far from central park;4
ive stayed at the hilton 3 times now i love the location right next to universal studios and a short walk from the subway if you get a high floor room you get a beautiful view the rooms are nice love the beds and having a fridge is a nice touch the restaurant has great food especially for breakfast not so good are the ridiculously expensive parking no microwaves in the rooms no vending machines have to buy things at insanely expensive store and the fact that they are just kind of backward and awkward in many ways its like they are stuck in the 1970s;4
our beds were comfortable and the rooms were great the hotel was close to everything we wanted the only complaint would be that we thought we heard pipes during different timessign of the age of the building;4
not sure why we had not stayed here before as great location next to the eye i was expecting traffic noise as central london but was pleasantly surprised the staff were some of the best premier inn staff we have encountered the room had air con and you could open the windows which was lovely as we had a nice breeze blowing in we would stay again;4
wyndham new yorker clean and cozy room staff was awesome and the tic tick good food lovely lobby to sit and people watch close to everything to do in the city the doorman had taxis ready and available at all times;4
very comfortable room for a short period not fancy room service is good no breakfast is offered at tbe hotel the area is near to chinese restaurants and the subway station not a very bad location;4
10 days spent in new york using this hotel as a base we had a family room which was great and very comfortable the hotel was in a perfect spot central for all our excursions in this fabulous city and the staff could not have been more helpful the roof terrace added to the great views of the city too a place to recommend;4
i loved the location the rooms were small but the hotel was friendly helpful and clean i had a great bellhop who was very helpful in my arrival i had to park my car and ask him to hold my bags his name was jeff and he is the guy to ask for my stay was from this summer but i just found his card and remembered that i gave him my word that i would give him a great recommendation better late than never its the second time ive stayed there no frills but pleasant clean and helpful;4
really nice hotel in a 5 star location special shout out to the manager on duty danny who was more than helpful and welcoming when i checked in after 12hrs of travel thanks again will definitely be back next time im in town;4
excellent location i could walk almost everywhere and the metro station is right outside the main door good fitness centre and rooms very clean although a bit small to be nyc its a very good pricequality keep in mind that the price of the hotel doesnt include the resort fees ad taxes;4
we stayed here one night because we were only 18 hours in newyork at the checkin there was a very friendly man who gives us a free upgrade we loved the room it was a larger room than we booked but for a european person it is a normal size the location of the hotel is perfect near centralpark the staff is very nice and helpfull if i go back than i will book this hotel again because of the pricequality and location;4
this is a nice little hotel decently priced clean with friendly staff it only loses a single point because the location feels a little unsafe we never had a problem to be fair but it does feel like i say a little unsafe at night;4
this hotel offers and excellent location to rest up after a day of sightseeing in los angeles especially near hollywood its out of the way of the business of hollywood which makes it great for sleeping the staff was very polite helpful and very professional the rooms were big with great comfortable beds and with all the amenities toiletries coffee maker and streaming for netflix and capabilities to stream your own personal home programming via digital your smart phone 1st hotel that i stayed at that offers this option without having to engage in the extra expense to watch movies the breakfasts are excellent and it is included however the parking is not it is away from the noise and crowd of hollywood but near enough that you can walk to the main tourist;4
how lucky to find well maintained digs right in the center of all the exciting activity in lincoln center the staff probably the most important factor next to good accommodations is warm and friendly from the helpful doormen chris constantine eugene dennis to the reception personnel like charde and pasquale all aim to please accommodations are comfortable and many of the rooms are being refurbished as i write this my only disappointment is with the old tried and true lobby furniture but i suspect that will be getting a needed facelift soon too the empire is a hop skip and a jump from the metropolitan opera upscale restaurants boutiques and shops the rates for ny are reasonable i call it my home away from home;4
if you want to stay in the lincoln centercolumbus circle neighborhood this hotel is your best best the hudson hotel is a terrible value by comparison and much more hectic and impossible to get any service at empire is smaller quieter with more attentive service and rooms are significantly larger with much better views there are some quirks the furnishings can be a bit worn down not the bed the bed is great thankfully and this is one of the worstsoundproofed hotels i have ever stayed at in a city in terms of how much street noise comes into the room also hotel manager who may be reading this you really need to give fullsized ironing boards to guests and the famous 8 bottled water bedside makes you look really absurd and creates unnecessary negative feelings;4
i stood at one of the solo cabins for 1 week the hotel is very clean the roomscabins are very clean also room service was performed everyday and altough the room did not have a fridge fresh water was always available every cabin has a lcd tv ipod dock with alarm and ac the staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel is just a 10min walk from the subway station the neighborhood is incredible with plenty of bars restaurants and coffee shops whenever i go back to ny the jane will the place to stay;4
the ameritania was a great place to stay and fitted our budget close to times square and central park an ideal base for our break rooms were clean and airy try and ensure a high floor as street noise can be intrusive special thanks to our barman javier who kept us entertained with a wide range of cocktails and mocktails for the younger members of our party his advice on where to eat and which sights to visit were invaluable special thanks also to jeff the doorman who arranged transport to the airport for us on the day we returned home;4
this hotel has a great rooftop bar and club the location could not be better around the upper west side it is across from lincoln square and 2 blocks from central park it is also near columbus circle so transportation in subway is easy the hotel is older but has a luxury decor the rooms are tiny but do not lack amenities;4
avoid the top floor as rooftop noise is significant rickey and pasquale at the front desk were very helpful lobby area was dark and elevators were not fully functional workout facilities were small and hard to find but were adequate;4
husband and i booked here for our anniversary trip to nyc because it was affordable and i wanted to stay in times square we did arrive in nyc before checkin time so we just left our bags with the hotel and we were off to start our adventure it couldnt have been more easy and they didnt even charge us for leaving the bags as i know some other hotels in nyc do just a couple bucks as a tip when we came back about 330 room was ready and bonus we got a room upgrade for our anniversary the room was huge it had a living room area with a couch and tv and a huge king size bed we were very happy with the room we also got a nice note from the front desk manager and a bottle of wine also even though we were close to the street we were never once woken up by the city noise;4
great place to stay if going to universal studios hotel staff was great rooms were clean and well appointed prices in the restaurant were extremely high compared to other restaurants in the immediate area;4
so the reason i gave this hotel 4 stars is because of the staff and the price being across from central park but it is not an updated hotel the room was old and dated the beds were hard as a rock and the mattresses were only about 5 inches thick but the staff was exceptional they were helpful and accommodating and extremely sweet people so if you want to save money on lodging and just need somewhere to sleep shower then this is the place;4
after three weeks on the road la was our final destination and the hilton fitted the bill well good hotel within an easy walk to universal studios and citywalk hotel was easy to check into and efficient we had a corner room which was a good size above average compared to some other hiltons the buffet breakfast was reasonably priced and provided a good variety the cafebar food was also pretty good the tour desk staff were great friendly efficient and helpful the tour suggested was pretty good and the ride to hollywood quick along the 101 overall a good experience in a good hotel a relaxing end to our us trip;4
its right next to penn station and madison square garden so across the street from the subway that you can take all the way to laguardia and down to the world trade center as well as other routes just south of times square otherwise it is an older high rise building i would guess 90 years old not sure it was ever deluxe and theres some deferred maintenance rooms are small at least mine was and they told me that they upgraded me from an even smaller room the upkeep and maid service is good however wyndham management means its got the shampoo conditioner handcream soaps decent cable tv safe and wifi no frills like minibars or anything like that no guidebook to the hotel or city or anything decent place if you really intend to spend most of your time;4
a beautiful hotel with lovely art deco features though not in the very heart of new york times square is an easy walk away and some rooms have great views of the empire states building the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful we even got a coffeetea making machine delivered to our room within minutes of our arrival;4
although the weather was freezing staff were warm welcoming and very patient subway very close most amenities within walking distance room clean and adequate free wifi in lobby comfortable lobby and waiting area door staff exceptional;4
nice hotel only minutes from burbank airport universal studios is next door clean hotel with good customer service and decent hotel gym featuring a cardio room and a separate weight room concierge level provides free breakfast and afternoon snacks downside valet parking is expensive and self park which is 15night is not convenient;4
my partner and i had been recommended this accommodation by a friend who visits new york on a regular basis we arrived to be met by a friendly helpfull receptionist we had booked the hotel through their own website for 965 for 7 nights however we were then told that tax had to added to this bringing the total to 1105 which was unexpected the room had two double beds a large flat screen tv and fridge and was clean and tidy with en suite bathroom shower the accomodation is about three blocks away from the broadway at 110th street metro station we bought a 7 day metro pass at 26 each this is excellent value as it covered all our travel for the week including our train to jfk for our return flight as apposed to 80 for a taxi there is a bank of america on the corner;4
always stay here on business great location for midtown business connections but also for times square and central park both just a short walk away comfortable place to stay very clean all the staff are very helpful and friendly particularly jeff who sorted out my luggage and taxi with professional ease and good humour;4
excellent location and very comfortable room front desk staff was very friendly and knowledgable clean and functional facility lobby bar was small and criwded and wifi only in lobby unless you paid exercise room was too small and with not enough variety of equipment;4
the hotel is within sight of the lincoln center hard to be located more centrally in manhattan the hotel lighting theme is intimate shadows if you like that kind of thing i shared a double room during a recent conference not much room to move around the bath amenities are nice and free in contrast to the minibar which is way expensive i couldnt afford to eat any meals at the hotel so cant say anything about food every hotel in manhattan is expensive for my budget so this seems as good as any;4
great location near subway and buses the staff was very friendly bed linens were very nice quality and the bed was comfortable the lobby decor is beautiful and great for sitting and having conversations;4
stayed during a weekend for a convention and have no major complaints the room was very clean and you cant hear any of the airplanes coming and going from lax the shuttle to and from the airport for free was a nice touch the room was a little on the small side and food was expensive but that is to be expected in any hotel i would definitely return to this hotel;4
room was smaller than motels outside of the city but very conveniently located and the view was great clean comfortable and restful after a full day quiet with nice ambiance guest orientated and very safe would stay again;4
tiny rooms but it is close to public transportation and lots of restaurants just across the highway from hudson river park great to jog or walk along the river helpful and efficient front desk staff;4
stayed at the new yorker hotel over thanksgiving holiday one downside on thanksgiving morning 3 am to 5 am the bands practice in front of macys which is one block away and you can hear the music other than that the hotel is old but being updated our room was small but very comfortable the bathroom could use a little more counter space but other than that a great hotel to stay at the staff from the doorman front desk staff security and housekeeping are wonderful made you fell so special also the water pressure in the shower was fabulous and hot will stay there again;4
although the room was excruciatingly small and we had no view the bed and pillows were quite comfortable the walls were a little flimsy because we could hear rooms around us taking showers and flushing the location is ideal nearly on top of the subway there are short walks to get to any of the subways there are many food options close by and the bell man was nice enough to stand in the rain and hail us a cab madison square garden is down the block while times square and bryant park are also within walking distance we were impressed that no one to get up to the rooms without showing their room keys to security;4
great location opposite central park good basic accomodation clean and tidy rooms very welcoming and helpfull staffrooms are slightly date but a quiet place to get your head down after a busy day in the city;4
stayed here for three nights in august 2010 great location for universal and hollywood nice pool good service breakfast in hotel restaurant was good la traffic is a nightmare at all hours which makes you want to stay close to the hotel and stick to the citywalk also micelis restaurant a few minutes from the hotel is great italian food and very kid friendly;4
i booked this hotel at the last minute and as it was only a short break this seemed ideal check in was quick and helpful hotel is like art deco style staff are really friendly lifts are quick great location we had two double rooms which were ok in size beds are comfortable clean rooms rooms arent very soundproof the only way i can describe this hotel is its like a piece of antique furniture its not sparkly and perfect it has chips and dents in it but that just adds to the charm i have stayed in a lot of lovely hotels and they seem a lot nicer but this hotel has a lot more to offer than them dont expect perfection but it has definitely made up for it in other ways cons needs a mirror in the room for ladies dressing or a shelf in bathroom to put things on;4
the location of the hotel is amazing the overall appearance of the hotel and all of the amenities are very nice and inviting i was not impressed with the front desk staff nor the concierge i did not find them to be helpful or customer service focused;4
lovely hotel right by the london eye madam tusuards shrek london dungeon and many other attractions friendly staff rooms comfortable food was great very busy hotel but well organised would definitely stay there again;4
this hotel is situated on 8th avenue corner of 34th street it is in a very central position for all attractions the empire state building and macys are a short stroll away check in was very straight forward with a luggage check in if you arrive early and your room is unavailable we asked for a high floor overlooking the empire state building and the views are fantastic the room was small as you can expect in new york the bed was comfortable and the room well kept within the service charge you have free wi fi telephone calls and use of the gym tick toch diner attached to the hotel serves a very good breakfast visit the lower ground floor which illustrates the history of the hotel and famous guests that have stayed there;4
pleased well beyond what we imagined have to hand it too this place cant beat the location just a 5 minute walk to universal and city walk but the shuttle was until 11pm in city walk it was just my daughters and me for the weekend we had tickets to universal studios and the teen choice awards we arrived a little early but had no problems checking in stewart was amazing a really great first impression for this place we really got an amazing room with views of universal the hollywood hills and downtown la in the distance i also liked the breakfast in bed feature to the room it really was a great breakfast though a little pricey i chose valet parking and it really paid off in the end more so when i checked out we arrived at 1pm sat and checked;4
great location too shallow sinks nice staff accommodating great breakfast buffet old air conditioning systems would return as i do every year for the met nice to have restaurant downstairs;4
my stay at the empire was for a business trip the location of the hotel was perfect its within easy distance to attractions via foot taxi uber or subway there are multiple restaurants and a whole foods nearby the staff was very prompt when there was an issue however dealing with those issues was at times complicated and took multiple staff members and a couple of days i also arrived early to the hotel they graciously stored my bags they were supposed to notify me when my room was ready they never did its not truly that big of an issue but if you state that you are going to do something follow through the only issue we had with the hotel room was that our 11th floor room air conditioner was unable to keep up with the temperatures of summer time new;4
lovely dramatic lobbyentrance that blasts you with hot air on arrival great location near lincoln center very friendly staff we appreciated that the hotel allows pets although we rhad to run out to buy litter and box immediately empire doesnt have room service which we missed and the mini bar peanuts were rancid though sealed keurig tea bags were not replaced after the first day but bottled water was provided for the machine called several times about nonpowerednonfunctioning room safe but despite multiple calls to front desk and a visit from security who contacted engineering and promised they would be up soon it was never fixed ended up carting heavy bag with laptop all over the city to my chagrin room heater smelled musty nice room otherwise though it;4
this hotel is in a great location we stayed a week and with 2 kids our room was a little small for us as was the bathroom the shower was hot and did fluctuate often but you get that with older buildings check in was easy the security at the lift was constant the staff were helpful each time i needed them we hired a fridge for our room which was brought up promptly was perfect for our milk etc for kids servicing was up to standard the tick tock diner was great with great food we had a view of w35th st from the 35th floor our stay was pleasant;4
1 you can sleep comfortably in a small room you may not think so but you can be sure you ask for a room away from the end of the hall because the doors opening and closing at all hours will be a nuisance the inside rooms with windows on the air shaft are the quietest 2 dont bring a lot of stuff with you this is a good place for a weekend visit not an extended stay pack light and be prepared for going down a long hallway to the bathroom depending on where your room is located 3 dont be shy say hello to your fellow guests of any gender who may be sharing the bathroom sink with you i dont like people seeing me brush my teeth but i got over it while the gentleman next to me finished having a shave neighborly 4 the bar is loud loud and often crowded but;4
the hotel had about 40 floors located in a historic building the standard room was nicely decorated and just big enough for one person given the price i paid including tax and fee i could not believe that there were several student groups could afford to stay at this hotel one thing that annoyed me was that there was always someone standing by the elevator asking everyone to show their room keys i dont know if this is for security reasons or not but the tone of voice of the person was rude and insulting nonetheless the hotel was in an excellent location with lots of restaurants and cafe;4
this hotel is a very nice hotel close to times square its retro big and busy we were a bit disappointed with our room as it was quite small and the view out both windows was brick buildings however as we spent most of our time out and about this wasnt a big problem another thing we were disappointed with was the fact that on the day we were leaving we got a bill pushed under the door charging us 22 per day for services we already paid our travel agency a load of money for this holiday and dont think we should be paying a service charge to hotel after wed already paid for the accommodation when we questioned it at reception the response we got was that the service charge was for water electricity and free wifi and most holiday resorts like barbados etc;4
i have just returned from a fantastic trip of new york city my first stay was at a hotel from hell on 106th street before my sister introduced me to the morningside inn hotel on the upper west side my nearly 3 week stay there was a breath of fresh air compared to the previous hotel it was clean quiet the staff was efficient and friendly and the manager is an absolute gem of a person there was a phone and fridge in each room and a kitchen fitted with a stove microwave and cupboards on each floor the common bathroom was shared by four rooms but that was ok as i never had to wait the room had window ac which was a bit loud but bearable and the window in the room couldnt open the location is excellent as its within walking distance to restaurants a supermarket;4
good location near buses and the underground train that goes to hollywood casino itself and connect s to other lines the checkin staff were very helpful letting us check in early we had a problem operating a few lights in our bedroom and maintenance were quick to arrive the cook at breakfast is very fast and good at preparing different egg combinations the variety for breakfast is very good but you get what you pay for they also have local comedians use a room once a week that guests are encouraged to be the audience for good value for money for a 35 class hotel;4
we enjoyed our stay at the empire hotel i would suggest better lighting and the ability to adjust the room temperature overall i was impressed with the front desk staff pasquale was especially helpful and personable;4
wed read the negative reviews about this hotel but booked it anyway because it was convenient to family we were visiting and some of it is true the corridors are dark and one bank of elevators doesnt work for the two that do work theyre warmokay theyre generally hotinside and depending on the time of day can be crowded however because of the reviews we had read we mentioned these issues at the front desk when we checked in note they couldnt honor our request for an early checkin as a result for 30 more we were upgraded to a junior suite both rooms bedroom and living room were spacious bright and clean there were some nice views from some of the windows and the air conditioners worked well and werent at all noisy any time there was a;4
this was the first place my partner and i stayed when we both moved to the uk from australia we found it to be comfortable and to surpass our expectations of hostel accommodation the only issue was the noise level was high at night sometimes but through no fault of the hostel the staff were very helpful and ensured we had a pleasant stay would definitely recommend to others;4
i was in new york on a business trip hotel is at an amazing location very near to columbus circle times square is walkable from this place very close to the central park as well you have restaurants near by i could find one indian restaurant as well;4
excellent location worthy price delicious breakfast and good service we were very pleased with the restaurant service mexican people willing to help always smiling great at service the room were just what we need small tidy clean and quite;4
i stayed at the jane for two nights with friends upon recommendation for somewhere to stay that was reasonable and a little different the jane is certainly that the rooms are very small clean and the fixtures and furnishings are excellent small tvs and a radio ipod dock are provided sleeping in the bunk beds was charming and comfortable i also enjoyed touches like the robes and slippers the aircon is quite loud and so had to be turned off at night but given that it was 31 degrees c during our stay in april meant that the room even with the window open did get quite warm the shared unisex bathrooms are of a high quality and very clean and well stocked with shower gel and shampoo etc service at the front desk was very friendly and very helpful expecially when;4
we stayed at the days inn for a week while in ny location wise you are away from times square but there us the underground subway only around the corner which is ideal to go anywhere the staff were pretty helpful behind the desk and the cleanliness was good the hotel is old and is showing wear and tear but from a budget point of view in ny we were aware that we werent going to get to much for our overall it is not bad food and laundry is across the street with a chemist shop on the corner;4
went on a business trip got a corner room with view facing universal studio harry potter castle hollywood hills room is huge for solo traveler and kept clean theres coffee maker mini fridge a couch coffee table and desk facing the windows love the windows amazing view too bad not much time to enjoy being in the room cant beat the location for family visiting universal studio walking distance to universal city with various shops and restaurants have to find the stairs to cross the bridge to universal city not a big deal once you found the stairs breakfast buffet was great unlimited choice there are other dining options didnt have time to try them hotel ground is beautiful didnt have enough time to enjoy the pools etc mostly work no;4
answer phones speed up elevators or make them all work if someone ask for upgrade and is willing to pay for the upgrade why not offer that i stay at your hotel cause i enjoy being across from lincoln center my son is a soloist with american ballet theater and from june they perform at the met for 8 weeks so i do come in different times with in that 8 week time frame to see him dance i have people come back that i like to entertain at your hotel but not having any sitting area to speak of it was hard so 1 night i had to entertain in lobby rather then ordering up to the room;4
stayed at the new yorker hotel from the 8th february till 13th february it was nearly midnight by the time we got to the hotel and had a very quiet check in we were give a newly refurbished room on the 8th floor and the bell boy took our luggage to our room room the room was one of the newly refurbished rooms with 2 double beds in it a coffee machine and also a fridge which was nice as i had read other reviews where many people said they had no fridge or coffee machine so it was a nice surprise there was a small corner which had 2 arm chairs in it where you could sit and read we had a chest of draws with 3 draws and 2 wardrobes which was nice as there where 3 of us staying in the room the only thing that let the room down was the size of the bathroom which is very small;4
the rooms are tiny but very clean and quiet with thick walls maid service excellent all basic amenities provided the tick tock restaurant was typically marginal ny junk fare but large man at entrance and who served us breakfast was obnoxious really rude to guests particularly a mexican couple he pointed at them individually and said you as the man was trying to explain something goodheartedly and made them recite what they wanted and walked away really really rude not pleasant to us either although he couldnt have done that and he rolled his eyes to us at a man who sat at the wrong table and made some remark he needs therapy and makes everyone feel upset or uncomfortable the downstairs restrooms in the morning were filthy on sunday morning;4
needed to find an affordable decent hotel the weekend before an unplanned visit to la this popped up and despite reservations due to some negative reviews i decided to book it turned out to be a wonderful old hollywood style hotel comfortable clean quiet conveniently located to public transit and tourist attractions with a staff that bent over backwards to accommodate our requests deena pil and the evening crew all provided their service and expertise according to our needs just an extraordinarily nice friendly place the down side was the lack of food nearby the restaurant on the premises never reopened after covid so any place to eat close by was non existent the neighborhood is a medical zone so unless you want to frequent hospital cafeterias you have;4
the hotel itself was clean breakfast was excellent however the room we got was downstairs near the noisy vending machine i heard them running all night long besides around 2am i heard some staff talking on the corridor hence i had some extra coffee in the morning;4
i booked this hotel as a cheap option through hotwire for my trip to new york citypositioned near the north end of central park close to 103rd st subway our room on 7th floor overlooked the park and had a very comfortable king sized bed very friendly and helpful staff present throughout the 3 night stay clean room with sheets and towels changed every day nice bathroom with shampoo soap and body lotions replaced as required small 6 person lift servicing 11 floors could mean a bit of a delay at busy periods nice deli with free wifi was only a block away for breakfast and restaurants were about 5 minutes walk away close proximity to subway meant travel to central manhattan was very easy my wife and i were very happy with the hotel at a bargain price for this;4
had a wonderful stay at the new yorker during the westminster dog show room was small with two double beds but we werent in our room that much and it was very tastefully decorated the bathroom was also small and my only complaint was that the water was hard to get adjusted as far as temperature we had a beautiful city view out of our 20th floor window fantastic location within walking distance of so so much and penn station is right down the street;4
we arrived to the hotel late at night after a night out and had a problem with our room we called the front desk and spoke to jorge who happened to have also checked us in the night before he was extremely helpful and despite the late hour took about 5 minutes arranging a new bigger and better room than we had initially reserved i was very impressed to be sure this is no 5 star hotel you already knew that but the great location next to a subway station make it an exellent bargain for us jorges help when we needed it made a great place to stay if you are planning to enjoy new york on a budget this a great place to start we had a very nice five nights stay in an excellent suite on the 12th floor;4
was sort of stuck going to this hotel since i went to visit a friend attending a conference and she was staying here there arent many choices in universal city either here or the sheraton which is basically next door was pleasantly surprised i shared a room with another girlfriend who flew in from outoftown so i had a room with two double beds on the 19th floor the room was fairly big and i felt as if my roommate and i could each have our own space we werent in the room very much and basically we just were there to sleep and shower in the morning we got what i think was the most basic room and it was quite nice had a small fridge in the room which we did not use lots of windows so we got natural light in the morning room was plenty dark at night i;4
after an awful stay of only one night in royal park aka the dump 258 west 97th street nyc we called in to days hotel to book a room the man on reception was more than helpful he let us call central reservations and told us that he would upgrade our room at no extra cost he gave us a choice of 2 rooms or a suite obviously we went for the suite thanks rudy what could have been an awful experience became something special;4
great location across from lincoln center with good nearby restaurantsthe hotel appears to have been renovated fairly recently and has a hip and funky flair with lots of comfy seating in the lobby bar the rooms are small but well planned good beds try to request a room not on an air shaft for a more pleasant stay;4
staff was excellent very very friendly and accommodating pool area was very nice the actual pool was a little on the smaller side but served its purpose the food was very good over all great time i would go back again and recommend it;4
had a great one night stay the staff dena was super helpful in providing written instructions for key places to visit checkingin bags and being available promptly hotel did not have the restaurant running due to covid but the staff was kind to share details around relevant restaurants open around thank you;4
we stayed here as part of a lastminutecom package hotel is in a great location just a short walk from the long island rail road and right next to madison square garden hotel was perfectly clean and the service was good only downside were small rooms and what was sold to us as a king size felt more like a double but hey you dont go to new york to sit in your room the hotel is absolutely massive so it may feel impersonal to be one of hundreds of guests but we didnt really mind in need of a bit of a refresh but that seemed to be underway whilst we were there would stay again;4
first of all i was a little skeptical after reading some reviews however we had an amazing stay the hotel was exactly what we needed it for â it was clean and the room was quiet at night for much needed sleep after exploring everyday i never found anyone at the front desk rude in fact everyone was so friendly polite and helpful i asked for a print out of a map pretty much everyday sent it to their email and they were more than happy to print out my information i think if you are nice then you will be treated accordingly maid service everyday was great â our room was clean and we had fresh towels every day and clean sheets every 23 days our room was quiet and i didnât have any trouble sleeping i in fact called up and requested a room on the 3rd floor that;4
the hotel was very unusual and fun built in 1907 it has a nautical theme so the rooms where like cabins on a ship our room was very small approx 6 ft x 8 ft with a window looking out into a courtyard area and facing another building about 100 feet away we stayed on the 4th floor but one night i could still hear music from the nearby nightclub earplugs would help if youre a light sleeper we had bunk beds each with its own reading light and small flat screen tv i slept in the top bunk which was an adventure just getting up and down the shared bathrooms were very clean and never crowded we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant that had a french algerian theme and even had an alligator on the wall it was fun too the location was great we were right down the;4
i stayed here march 1014thit was my second time in nyc this time i traveled with my 11 year old son we found this hotel through this website which directed us to bookitcom we paid a mere 79 a night for this gem the hotel is in a residental neighborhood right across the street from central park it is no where near midtowntimes square but that is not a problem since there is a subway three blocks away as for dining options there is a deli two blocks away that serves great coffee and delicious bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwiches as well as other breakfast favs crepes on columbus about 3 blocks down is also a great dining option the neighborhood also has small shops as well as several produce stands and food carts the rooms arent in the best shape;4
visiting for the fourth time fine hotel nice staff en good rooms location is ecellent for sightseeing next to the metro penn trainsstation lots of restaurant in de area walking distance tot time square;4
i stayed here for 4 nights in january while on a shopping trip with my girlfriend although being a little bit out from the main attractions the hotel overall was fine rooms were clean bed was great and there was lots of hot water so it suited me down to the ground it costs around 12 to get a cab to times square and its a 10 minute journey 5th avenue is also a 10 min journey for about the same price its right across the street from central park which is very picturesque staff were friendly enough and overall its a great base to explore ny for a few days no problems at all would recommend also check out soho while your there if you like trendy shops this is your place with the likes of bathing ape adidas ben sherman and others if your there long enough try and;4
it is a neat place close to the hammersmidt station very good beds and linen shifted every second day no bar and the common tv room was tiny paid wifi available lacked cosiness very narrow walkthroughspassages a bit prison likeall in all value for money;4
nice hotel rooms with very confortable beds and balcony a very good breakfast and a very kind and friendly cook hugo i definetely recommend this hotel for visiting the area altough not suitable if the goal is to visit themeparks as it is a little bit to far except from universal;4
i have said what i want to say have free wifi and now i want to be out of this i will remember never to fill out your survey again have i not made myself clear yet this survey is too onerous i will remember never to fill out your survey again this survey is too onerous i will remember never to fill out your survey again;4
as a new yorker this is one of my favorite hotels to stay at for a ministaycation stayed here with my boyfriend twice already and have no major complaints pros location right by lincoln center and across the street from awesome restaurants eat at cafe fiorello if you get a chance the hotel will help you make a reservation there and if its on the weekend make sure you make the reservations early theres also a duane reade on the same block for anything else you may need bars theres a bar in the lobby which is awesome and the area around is very lounge like there is also a rooftop loungeclub which hotel guests get to have access to without standing on line outside line usually gets ridiculous on a friday and saturday night staff all the staff at the hotel is;4
listen its ny baby and hotel prices are sky high or very mundane and possibly bedbug ridden instead try a periodpiece boutique hoteltype fun center minutes from the high line and all else hip and happening in the city that never sleeps to boot 99night ok the rooms are tiny and i mean it at about 7 ft x 4 ft but hey what are going to do in ny stay in your room like i said its ny and if youre flying solo for a layover or a few days the jane cant be beat for the budget and the slightly ocdminded never stop exploring;4
stayed here for 4 nights at the end of august and found the hotel to be fine i love the location with many bars and shops within a 10 minute walk and the subway a 30 second walk rooms smallish but fine coffee maker and cable tv supplied would stay here again;4
staff superb location is excellent across road from madison sq garden rooms small but to be expected in new york reception area immaculate but hallways could do with updating clean tidy and maid service every day wifi is excellent very fast but you need to sign in everyday overall no complaints;4
this is a beautiful facility no problems with check in or check out a bit priceywe used points and still paid over 200 on top of that front desk staff was fabulous no real complaints except one of the bath towels had hair stuck in it yuck and one of the soaps that was in the box had been used yuck again we didnt complain because stuff happens although i did ask for fresh soap overall this is a great place to stay;4
location great rooms small but adequate food and cafe very good although the rooms are a bit shabby they are all you need when visiting new york as we were out and about from early to late loved our time here;4
me and my girlfriend stayed here in september for 4 nights we jumped on a bus from the airport and it dropped us off near times square we got lost as we didnt have a map bur it was about 5 minutes walk away once we got our bearings staying near times square is a good idea as you always know where you are and your close to the action the hotel was really nice with friendly staff and bars and restaurants next door you get free wifi in the lobby its about 10 minute walk to central park and right on 8th avenue which was our favourite road for bars and action we got the hop on hop off bus tour package for 3 days with the boat trip which was our highlight and rockerfella centre catching the subway is the fastest and cheapest way of getting around new york brilliant city;4
ideal location to get around nyc with access to the subway taxis or walk to without being in the full on hustle and bustle of being nearer to times square highly recommend will be going back and possibly stay here again;4
pros above average complimentary breakfast eggs cooked to order and miniwaffles very near metro line easy access to hollywood walk of fame and universal studios nice and helpful staff decent fitness room clean room with flatscreen tv minifridge and small microwave nice courtyard and pool gatedsecure parking cons parking is a bit steep 22 per day location in la is a bit on the seedy side but so are huge swaths of la noise in the courtyard can carry late at night and i found two little bugs in the bathroom on the last day not a big deal however overall a very good place to stay for the price except for the parking fees id recommend and stay again;4
heart of nyc classic clean hotel good price room was little but enough enjoyed would come back it wouldve been perfect if we could have succeeded on checking in early that was impossible and other gests waited in the lobby in the same situation;4
we stayed here for four days while seeing some baseball in la the hotel was in the perfect location for the metro to anaheim and a short 15 cab ride from dodger stadium sunset and hollywood blvds are nearby while the area isnt ideal we two 30 something females walked around late at night and we were fine the hotel has a sauna a pool a gym free wifi and a great free breakfast with an egg station parking is 20 a night the room was nice and large with a balcony facing downtown the staff we interacted with were very friendly and theres nothing more i could have asked for;4
yes its a bit dated but its still very nice the rain shower is wonderful they upgraded us which was greatly appreciated everyone is super nice and helpful very convenient to subway and columbus circle;4
hotel is in an excellent location a two minute walk from central park and a fifteen minute stroll to times square room was a good size but the shower room was tiny the only negatives were the very expensive drinks in the lobby bar better value in the rooftop bar plus a fantastic view and no free wifi in the rooms only in the lobby but i wound definitely stay again;4
clean rooms great location only 2 minutes walk from the subway which takes you downtown in minutes lots of places to eat within a 10 minute walk staff were extremely helpful with hotel matters and directions no wifi in the rooms was the only downside had to go to the lobby to go online and there was not a lot of seating there as everyone was down there using the wifi;4
family of 4 kids are university age we loved the location we walked everywhere except took subway to 911 site as well as to yankee stadium easy walking distance to times square broadway empire state building central park moma the met and msg hotel staff were very friendly and managed to get us 2 rooms on same floor rooms very clean beds comfy wifi not great but cant have everything perfect for the price i highly recommend;4
had a very good experience at this hotel its was very nice very clean room was huge however like most things in la it was expensive be sure to budget for it but i would recommend this place if you can afford it;4
fantastic location right next to central park metro lines a 1 rooftop bar is very good the pool is small but served a purpose rooms are a decent size well stocked mini bar but very pricey better to pop to local store good turndown service and staff are very friendly and accommodating would definitely stay again some great bars nearby including lincoln bar on 57th bar nine on 54th for live music and valhalla for good selection of craft beer;4
i recently stayed at this hotel for a business meeting for 4 days i had a maintenance problem with the first room that i was given at check in the maintenance person showed up within 5 minutes of my call but the issue could not be quickly resolved and i was moved to another room within 10 minutes the hotel seems to be older and a little run down but not bad the room was large and updated at some point but not what i would call luxurious still it was reasonably comfortable clean and quiet on friday and satruday nights they have a huge seafoodprime rib buffet 49 you need a reservation room service breakfast was reasonably priced on time and the food was good the most impressive thing about this place is the service the staff were great;4
thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the empire hotel it has a convenient location to central park and a wide range of other activities however i never give a 5 star rating to any lodging facility that charges for internet access they charge both for in your room internet service or for in the lobby area service you can get free internet service up on the pool deck however be warned to get to the pool patio you need to ride the elevator to the 11th floor and then climb two full flights of stairs bathroom sink design is cute but creates limited space between the bottom of the faucet and the sink design flaw also with the shower downward spout but no closing door and regularly splashes water onto the floor of the bathroom and we only received a floor mat once out of the;4
amazing that i can get free internet on the streets on manhattan but not in the hotel the room was overall nice but lacking basic amenities no glasses limited wet bar and just enough bathroom linen for one night for one person;4
i stayed in the new yorker hotel in a queen suite on the 22nd floor with city views from the terrace pros the suite with two connected rooms and two bathrooms gave my family enough space to spread out rooms were very clean and the bedmattress was very comfortable and firm terrace was probably the single best feature of the room with breathtaking city views facing east historic art deco charm and variety of room types location location location close to penn station k town times square subway station on same block good security for hotel guests cons front desk service felt a bit rough around the edges they gave me a hard about holding my luggage until checkin they finally relented however why isnât this a standard service at a 3 star;4
i traveled to nyc for business and stayed here for one night i selected this hotel solely based on proximity to my business meeting figuring i could manage just about anything for one night first the good i was greeted upon checkin by helena who was very friendly and helpful i was upgraded to a junior suite i had a king room reserved the jr suite adds a couch chair and coffee table which im glad for as i cant imagine what the size of a regular room would be given how small the junior suite was but of course small room size isnt a big surprise given the nature of the hotel the bathroom was also on the small size but very managable more plusses the bed was very comfortable and the shower had an overhead rain shower head with handheld attachment;4
perfectly located rooms adequately sized and very clean good value while we did not go to the rooftop lounge it seemed to be very popular concierge was very helpful in getting us to the right subways and attractions rooftop pool however was more of a lap pool so not great for kids eds chowder house a great restaurant;4
beautiful hotel just across from lincoln center very convenient for a night out at the opera pricey for the room itself but the location is unbeatable will be returning for another met opera stay in the future;4
we are a family of 4 kids 69 and stayed for 4 nights the room was a little tight and a small bathroom but that seems the norm in nyc the staff wad friendly professional and helpful and chris the concierge is great the pool was a major reason we stayed here to give the kids a little break from sight seeing it is cold and tiny like 3 feet wide by 15 feet longso didnt get much use of italso they never seem to have enough pool towels and they are stained and kinda gross if you do get one i do highly recommend they get new and more pool towel the location is great close too colombus square where the subway and central park are it definitely has a nightclubfeel to it and long lines at night to get to that venue nit that we ever made it up there bc;4
i stayed here because of the location later when we decided not to go to universal studios it felt like we spent too much for the price they should at least include breakfast they also charge you for parking and service tax pros room was clean with a view of universal studios quiet and comfy cons value for the price daily parking fee lobby was too busy with too many things not crowd;4
i stayed at the hilton for only one night a couple of days after christmas at first we were planning to visit the park first and then checkin at the hotel and go back to the park later at night then i read that due the expected higher levels of visitors the park would be open at 730am for transformers and 8am for the rest of the rides so i decided we take advantage of the early entry which was available to everyone so night before we walked to citywalk which has a lot of great restaurants and shops to eat and browse then next day we got to the park at 715am which had a line of less than a hundred people which is miniscle compared to disney the gates open at 730am it took about 15 minutes to get down to transformers we were able to ride it twice before 8am and;4
great hotel super convenient and easy walk to and from the airport from or to the terminal furthest from the hotel the walk is 20 minutes max very safe environment rooms are large beds are fantastic;4
spent a night in the hotel between flights the hotel clear and the facilities are nice free wifi is a winner dinner at lobby restaurat was fine actually everthing was fine but i still missed a little personality;4
stayed here december 2013 just reviewing now the hotel when we stayed it wasnt wyndham it was just the new yorker the hotel is very clean very close to empire state building its location literally across the street from penn station is very convenient quite a small bathroom we had a queen room the rooms are not very big but clean and comfortable and who goes to nyc to sit in the hotel room so for us this hotel was great;4
ive now stayed at the morningside three times and would come back again yes its a budget hotel with pretty basic accommodations but if youre visiting nyc for pleasure and just need a place to crash this place fills that need the upper west side location cant be beat either with quick and easy access to the subway and bus lines just have realistic expectations of what youre getting hint you dont get fancy champagne on a beer budget and youll be fine;4
stayed at the hilton because of its location the view from our room was wonderful we had a gal check us in and she was so kind it is old and the beds were horrible but for the location it was perfect for our needs the buffet in the hallway was very unsanitary we ate out the staff were so kind we will probably stay again because of the great location but it defiantly needs some renovating;4
well situated walking distance of universal city nice size rooms clean beautiful viewsexcellent breakfast buffet courteous and helpful staff undergoing remodeling project so a little less appealing around lobby and area of elevators elevators were a little congested and demanded a little patience but still worth it;4
everything was great except for the surprise that you charge 5 a bag to store before checkin iâve stayed in many wyndham hotels including the new yorker iâve never had to pay a fee as a wyndham rewards member i think this service should be included the location was a 3minute walk from penn station many of the theaters were only a 1520 minute walk;4
this was my first time staying in a hotel in the city and it was a good choice i was having a gathering at their rooftop lounge and it was convenient to stay at this hotel as soon as i checked in and said it was my birthday i was upgraded to a bigger room at no additional charge although the hotel is not affiliated with the rooftop its still a very nice hotel to stay in i thought perhaps they would give me some perks since i was a guest but they didnt the only perk i received was not making a line overall it was a good stay hotel is very clean and staff was very friendly it met my expectations and i would definitely book another stay be aware that some of the hostesses at the rooftop lounge are very rude and really dont care if your are a guest of the hotel;4
the new yorker is located directly at pennstation near madison square garden small but clean room great view from the 30th floor nice 24 breakfast at the tictocrestaurant in the lobby good wifi friendly staff;4
the location is superb very close to madison square gardens subway stations and within walking distance to times square we travelled 3 adults and a child under 2 for a long weekend the room with two double beds and a crib was of an adequate size it is new york after all we made the hotel aware upon booking that we needed a crib and it was provided no problems the check in was smooth and room clean upon arrival 2pm we left our luggage at the hotel when we checked out and it cost 2 a piece a bit cheeky when you have spent out on staying at the hotel and daily resort fees the hotel had wifi that was an ok speed for surfing and i managed to connect to netflix one evening when staying in babysitting overall a positive experience i would recommend and stay;4
very nice hotel located just blocks from times square central park and theater district great location for business or pleasure clean rooms excellent staff and fairly priced easy access from laguardia or newark airportd;4
having stayed at hilton properties worldwide i would say this one rates about average thats not to say there is anything wrong with it but it doesnt do anything to stand out from the hilton crowd the hotel is well equipped has a good breakfast and buffet lunchdinner throughout the day the gym is small but perfectly adequate and the rooms themselves are nice where this hotel could improve is the staffing every attempt to query or dispute something you are unhappy with is done unprofessinally and in cases makes you feel like you are a liar for example i stayed at this hotel twice the first time i had a rate inclusive of parking on subsequent stay the hotel tried to charge me for parking when i raised a query the manager had a 10 minute disagreement with me before;4
recently spent a week at the hotel on short family break fairly typical for a riad in medina environment in morocco strong points were easy going and friendly staff rooms were acceptable but probably going to need upgrading in not too distant future they were also a little cramped with not a lot of space to do much weak points no tv not a major problem poor lighting in room making reading almost imppossble lack of hot water and shower not working properly attempted to have this resolved but came to nothing tolerable but not really acceptable for the price of the room inhouse meals need to be ordered in advance and drinks expensive but par for the course in marrakech which is probably the most expensive place in morocco all in all enjoyable but would probably;4
i stayed at the empire hotel from 818415 i had made my reservation thru a groupon offer which directed me to bookingcom consequently my rate was below the rack rate the hotel is centrally located with very easy access to lincoln center other broadway theaters and columbus circle hotel have been renovated and the rooms are comfortably sized and equipped air conditioning was very efficient for the very hot and humid weather during my stay i have stayed in other nyc hotels that were not nearly as comfortable for a much higher nightly cost checkin and check out was efficient hotel staff was pleasant and helpful only con would be that everything is everything is a la carte from the keriug pods for inroom to simple laundry bag for dirty clothes no plastic or;4
not the nicest place i have ever stayed but very clean friendly helpful staff and a lovely walk into the hussle and bussle of times square if you are on a budget you couldnt go wrong its everything you need a place to sleep after a busy new york day we went as a family and had rooms next to each other we arrived early and the staff looked after the luggage they sorted out a car to take us to the airport the little deli nearby top of the park near the subway did a lovely blt for breakfast along with a coffee which was lovely to sit in the park and enjoy;4
another trip to new york and this time we chose the empire based on a recommendation and a reasonable rate the empire is located in a pretty good spot within walking distance of many shops restaurants and entertainment places being on broadway and columbus is great for navigation as a pedestrian and getting a cab as a weekend getaway we unfortunately couldnt spend very much time at the hotel and i cant comment on the nightclub of course the rooms are tiny as are any other manhattan hotel rooms in our price range but our room on the 5th floor overlooking broadway had little street noise and we slept very well others have mentioned the peculiarity of the shower without the door and it did seem odd to us but the ceiling shower was very nice and strong the;4
as a solo traveler stayed in a singlebed cabin with shared bathroom in the hall for 2 days the room of course was tiny im guessing about 6x10 there is some space above and under the bed for storage of your luggage etc the bed was fine though tallerbigger people might have issues hdtv in there with a variety of channels ac worked ok if a bit loud plenty of power jacks though the power turns off when you take the key with you bummer for charging electronics when youre out the room was fairly clean although it did have a little bit of that oldtimeymustiness to it the carpet was a little tired too free decent quality wifi as well the shared bathroom was no issue at all cleaner than a lot of gym locker rooms ive been in didnt run into other guests in;4
this is a great base for exploring la we got an annual pass for universal studios 8 minute walk so we could pop in out you also get discount on the city walk restaurants and in the universal shops hollywood boulevard warner studios only a short cab ride breakfast buffet expensive but a coffee shop in the hotel had croissant etc staff friendly helpful the pools not great but fine for the kids to let off some steam overall i would definitely recommend this hotel;4
basic hotel trying to look expensive near columbus circle lincoln centre midtown ny jazzed up art deco style quirky a stones throw from central park 2030 mins walk into times square via broadway which the hotel us located remember beoadway us some 1722 miles long perfect location if you like to explore ny on foot buzzing with arty types students would stay again if wanted to avoid hustle bustle of ny;4
excellent location close to times square and you can walk to central park jeff the door man is wonderful very helpful and knowledgeable you can ask him anything about new york the only down side was the bar we went down on the saturday night for a drink before dinner and found that it was closed saturday and sunday night no explanation why the free tea and coffee in the morning was a nice touchbut it would have been nice to have a kettle in the room we would recommend this hotel to friends and family;4
very nice hotel we will stay here again excellent location the roof top lounge has an amazing view and a nice place to relax overall staff was very accommodating and helpful this was our first trip to new york and staying at the empire hotel;4
we stayed at this hotel during the 4th of july weekend the new yorker wyndham hotel is a historic hotel located at eighth avenue 35th street in new york city united states the 43story art deco hotel opened 1930 and is located in manhattans garment district and hells kitchen areas near pennsylvania station madison square garden times square and the empire state building the hotel offers two restaurants and conference space since reopening as a hotel in 1994 it has undergone capital improvements including lobby and room renovations and infrastructure modernization the unification church purchased the building in 1975 and since 2014 it has been part of the wyndham hotels resorts chain we were here as part of conference with hundreds of other attendees;4
lovely hotel with a huge family room the location was perfect for our visit to universal and we really enjoyed our staywe had great views over the billed and city with a beautiful sunset our only disappointment was that were traveling with friends and our rooms were not close together this would have made our stay much easier;4
stayed here for 7 days in early may the hotel was clean and the location was perfect our room was very good although we paid for a large king size based on knowledge that most nyc hotel rooms are very short of space we were given a free bottle of wine to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary maid service was excellent and we found the reception staff efficient and polite there was a doorman named jeff who was outstanding he was overtly friendly and went out of his way to help he was in a different league to all of the other doormen who just did their job with minimal conversation i think jeff should be awarded for his fantastic customer service a barman was also very friendly although i dont recall their name the only one negative i had was the noise the hotel;4
the hotel is in a very good location away from the midtown activity and noise regarding the noise if looking at lincoln center the view is nice but the nightly noise level is not good higher the floor the better but still an issue for those on business needing desk and work space electrical outlets are very limited there are a number of small restaurants on broadway a short walk that are very good and less expensive than mid town prices;4
i booked this hotel a month in advance i then started reading some reviews and was terribly anxious as i read some horrible things let me just say that i was comforted the moment we checked in the front desk bobby was as pleasant as could be we got our room in seconds and although it was a little small it was clean and bright even at 3am my boyfriend and i have stayed all over this world and we both agreed that we have never ever slept with the comforter on a bed until now ive read reviews with people talking about dirty bedding we did not see this and we actually slept with all the bedding it was the most comfortable sleep i have had away from home the room was a little small but it served its purpose as we were not there to hang out in a hotel room;4
the hotel was great for my family hotel staff was very friendly and helpful close to central park and subway for easy transportation decorated very nicely rooms were small but was kept clean and tidy great price for a great hotel;4
empire hotel located right aside the lincoln center has an excellent location lincoln center columbus circle 1 train subway central park and plenty of good quality variations of restaurants and food in the neighborhood we found in an excellent place to have our hub while touring new york city for a week empire hotel is very reasonably priced large and clean rooms and the service is excellent in the few interactions we had to have and i do especially mention daria in the reception who advised us as nyc newbies thanks;4
hilton los angelesuniversal city has the best location near universal studios we loved to stay there every summer we can easily drive to any other destination in la this hotel has a wonderful service and offers a delicious breakfast buffet;4
despite it is a budget hotel wasnt bad the room was big enough clean room and bathroom wifi was a bit week the lift is too small busy and slow like snail location is good subway is pretty close make an easy access to the centre good restaurants around it staff were alright;4
choose this hotel because of its proximity to penn station since we took the train from dc its close to times square theater district empire state macys restaurants shopping and the subway the hotel is old but well preserved for the most part historical spot that has maintained its relevance service is over top excellent at every encounter tic tock restaurant is a great 247 diner amenities include a well equipped up to date fitness center our room was your typical small ny queen but it was comfortable enough and met our expectations i would stay here again;4
stayed here one night prior to boarding a cruise was put into a newly renovated room small room but very nice and clean close to many things including madison square gardens and penn station would stay here again;4

the first thing i would like to say is that we went in january when it was snowy and very coldthe astor on the park was so toasty it was lovely and warm the rooms are quite small but clean enough what more do you need than somewhere just to put your head downyoure in the big cityget out there and see it the aotp is close to a subway station so you will never be without transport we walked the full length of central park one morningit was lovely snow covered gardens dont be put off by the location way up in manhattenas i said the subway was 2 mins walk away we would definately stay here if we went ny again there are plenty of delis just round the corner too gorgeous bagels;4

this is a good hotel with the hilton quality you are used to nice big rooms clean furnished clasically there arenât much to do inside the hotel and pub restaurant can benefit from decorative changes great location for visiting the theme park easy to reach downtown beverly hills hollywood blvd nightmare to go to santa monica airport so it depends on where you want to spend your time during your holiday;4

visted new york in september with my daughter for sightseeing shopping the hotel is ideally placed opposite maddison square gardens at the corner of 34th 8th everything in new york is walkable and you are only a short walk to times square the empire state the rockafella centre the hotel is an iconic art deco building so rooms are old fashioned but clean and spacious as this was a bitrhday celebration trip we were upgraded to a large 2 bathroom 2 double bedded room note that plugs in the room are limited so we bought an extension lead the hotel also gave us a free late checkout until 3pm which was great as we had evening return flights staff were friendly helpful;4

stayed here for 2 nights last month rooms are very expensive for what you get thats not to say they are bad as they are not they are just dated and need a refresh all staff were really nice and the bar service was fast breakfast was silly overpriced 2 buffets ran to over 60 before tip so dont eat in the hotel location is great 5 min walk down road and over the bridge and you are at the security checkpoint the only real negative is the price they charge given the dated rooms but given the location its a captive market for the park and the hotel was very busy;4
i stayed here in the very busy holiday season so rates were inflated 450 per night all in this is a busy large hotel and itâs well located in midtown manhattan my late checkin and normal checkout were quick and the staff courteous and efficient the room is fine actually an ok size by nyc standards and the beds comfortable the room shows a few signs of wear in places but everything you need is there and works bed was comfortable the shower was a little temperamental but pressure was good room was wonderfully quiet on the 34th floor the wifi was excellent in the room the lifts are busy and slow so much so that you will want to limit travel back and forth to the room if you can i bought my suitcase to breakfast although itâs not classy i really liked the;4
compared to the beacon the rooms are small and there are no views but the bathroom was nice and the bed comfortable i didnt turn on the tv i appreciated the warning about the radiator heating system but its clicking did not keep me awake front desk people were very friendly;4
stayed at end of november for two nights great location and great beds room was tiny and bathroom even smaller very european in setup but the tipping point is the high cost we payed about 900 for the two nights which is too much for this tiny room maybe we did not shop well for this room but i believe i stayed at the plaza once for less very simply it is very expensive for what is given in return;4

you may not think of staying at a hotel as an adventure but then you may not have stayed at the jane hotel we booked this room on the advice of a friend whod stayed there several times in the past i was intrigued by the history and quirkiness of a hotel designed to resemble a turn of the century cruise ship it didnt disappoint so much of the original architecture is still intact and in reasonably good shape the staff wear period correct uniforms complete with early 20th century bellhop hats i was very impressed with their helpfulness and friendly manner the tiny elevator has been rehabbed for modern use but maintains the original style i have to admit the whole place reminded me of disneys tower of terror ride but in a very good way upon checkin youre given a;4

the jane may not be for everyone it is bare bones with a hipster vibe especially with the club on the first floor this was my second visit no business amenities just a place to crash after a long day in the city great location in west village short walk from 14th st subway 123 or a train close to village vanguard if you are a jazz buff funky lobby with stuff peacocks and other animals on the walls the bunk room is 50 square feet toilet and shower at the end of the hall spotless will book a stay for next december during spring and summer it has a great roof top bar lot of euro tourists close to chelsea market high line park meat packing district trendy restaurants totally cool area;4
always use premier stayed here before this time couldnt get through in advance tried for two days wanted to check an hour early or drop off cases had to take them to first appointment no hot water on the night we stayed or in the morning very hot day slightly spoiled the trip;4
art deco style wellmaintained and fooddrink options are also good room was small and somewhat outdated but the location is great and within walking distance of many attractions staff is accommodating and professional;4
nice and clean hotel met my expectation of how a hyatt regency should be very spacious guestroom surprisingly quiet even the airport is within walking distance washroom is nicely designed instead of a formal dining room they only serve dinner in the bar area which is like sitting in the lobby there doesnt seem to be any high end restaurant nearby particularly if you dont drive parking fee overnight is ridiculous for an airport area hotel one of the front desk lady could use some mcdonalds trainingsmile shuttle driver could be more friendly;4
i stayed at the new yorker hotel in the month of august in 2016 i had a standard room which was as advertised nothing special no mini fridge the room had a comfortable bed a tv and the bathroom was well equipped with a hair dryer the staff were polite and courteous and even gave me a room with a slight view of the empire state building which was a nice touch that brings me to the best feature of this hotel the location everything important was walking distance away there are also some very good dining location in close proximity to the hotel overall i enjoyed my stay at the new yorker hotel and would stay there again in the future alex;4
we stayed here for the weekend of anime con nyc i was a bit concerned as this is an older hotel i can say we were all pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our stay we were a group of 5 two moms and 3 teen girls that were attending anime nyc from the minute we checked in to the minute we left we had a pleasant experience check in was smooth we asked for a rollaway because we had a group of 5 we needed one of the larger rooms to accommodate the rollaway our room was not ready yet so they took my number and said they would call when ready we checked our bags and off we went someone called a few hours later and told me the room was ready we went up and our room was clean and comfortable our rollaway came right up we called down and they brought our luggage up;4

the location of this hotel is very good it is right across madison square garden and penn station where you can take a couple of subways and trains the busstop is about 10 minutes walking from the hotel from our room we saw the empire state building 5 minutes walking madisons square garden and the chrystler building it is easy to walk to times square 10 minutes the room was clean the bathroom could be a little more modern but it was clean and that is important the rooms are very noisy so you can almost everything your neighbours do also too bad there was no refrigerator in the room the staff was very helpfull and even gave us a discount on the fee you have to pay per night because we stayed there for 10 days that was cool;4
stayed two nights just to go to universal check in and out was smooth room was comfortable and clean ate at the bar the first night since the restaurant was closing as we checked in food was pretty good and staff very nice would stay again if going to universal due to 5 minute walk to park and shops;4
this is the 2nd time my boyfriend i stayed at the hilton los angeles universal city this is also the 2nd time we booked an alcove room because we loved it so much the 1st time we visited the alcove room is a corner room of the hotel with large windows and somewhat of a panoramic view our room was ready to be checked in to at 1pm which is nice most hotels dont have their rooms ready until 3 or 4pm the room was incredibly clean again i always check for bed bugs thankfully none were found the room was quite spacious for a corner room the bathroom was huge they offer great crabtree evelyn ammenities the reason why i only gave this hotel 4 stars not 5 is because of the mixup of my reservation i had originally made my reservation online 4 days;4
very expensive hotel for what it is but such a good location the staff were very friendly easy walking distance to universal bed was so so comfy showers were also very good really enjoyed it here but there was no wriggle room on late check out;4
this was our first accomodation for our month long europe trip it was so affordable and less than a 5 minute walk from hammersmith tube station which was perfect for us some nice local places to eat especially the hammersmith ram few good shopping places around for the days you dont want to travel in to the city accomodation was very simple very clean but honestly had everything you need when your travelling around no complaints here;4
we spent in abercron house in may 2013 for 3 nights we had double room with shared bathroom considered it is a hostel we had nice stay rooms toilets and bathrooms were very clean buffet at the enterance has very cheap and friendly prices for meal drinks or cosmetics hotel is close to bus and underground station where tesco and some fastfoods can be found the only minus is no free wifi and kitchen without any equipments so you have to bring your own pots and pans which is not practical if you are tourist;4
budget hotel with a really good location it was really nice to come back to the area after busy days in new york city would recommend both the area and the hotel worth the money if you compare the prices;4
i was on a day trip to california and just needed somewhere inexpensive but decent quality to stay for the night and this place seemed to fit the bill i wasnt pleasantly surprised by the size of my room it was quite large and included a separate seating area and table as well as the bed and was decorated quite well and kept clean the bathroom was a little bit small and some of the wallpaper was peeling off the walls a bit but it was perfectly functional the hotel is situated on a busy road but i didnt hear any noise in the evening and was able to get a decent nights sleep i also had a good breakfast in the morning i cant comment on the area the hotel is situated in as i didnt really explore that i would stay at this hotel again;4
the hotel itself i found lovely really cute done what it needed nice and clean also location isnt the greatest but it wasnt a problem as still close to central of everything the only concern i have of the hotel was that a friend of mines item went missing when we told the hotel staff it went missing the hotel maid came round the next day with it saying it had accidentally been taken during cleaning not sure if i buy that story but either way it was a pleasant stay;4
loved the lobby it even smelled amazing hotel halls were very stale smelling beds were rock hard lobby bar rooftop were very nice relaxing drinks were similar in price to other restaurants in town;4

just stayed here for 5 nights paid about 90 usd pr night with parking thought the location was good and the neighborhood was decent enough had a nice clean room facing the street which was a bit noisy but the staff offered us to move when we asked breakfast is extra good here as they cook you omelets or whatever kind of eggs you want dont see that to many places thanks to hugo and the rest of the team for a pleasant stay;4
we stayed at this hotel in may 2012 obtained through an expedia secret saver deal so didnt know which hotel we would be getting at the time at first it was a disaster as on checking in we had to wait ages while our room on the so called 10th floor was readywe checked back and were told we were now on the 8th floor went to the room and it was right near the lift noisy and had 2 beds instead of one queen etc we went down and complained and was given a lovely room on the 2nd floor that was much larger and just perfect for us only complaint was the mini fridge although working was keeping drinks at room temperature did check out the night club but was not really our scene didnt hear any noise in our room hotel was nice and close to everything did have;4
the new improvements to the hyatt regency at los angeles international airport are in keeping with the original buildings 1964 pedigree originally designed by the firm of welton becket architects of the famed capitol records building in hollywood the new interior improvements pay homage to the midcentury modern era in which this building was originally conceived the dramatic lobby has opened up to the rear of the building and the bar and the former restaurant has also opened up such that all of the space flows informally together there are numerous opportunities to sit or lounge in different areas and enjoy intimate conversations or larger gatherings communal dining and lounge tables also allow one to start new conversations with fellow travellers the rooms are;4
first room was tiny and not enough space for the luggage but was moved the next night to a room i would have expected for the hotel name and price the staff were friendly and we did use both the bars for drinks and food and although pricey we enjoyed it one man on reception stood out as working above and beyond the call of duty great location and close to everything but the rooms on floors 20 and above need a refurb;4
this hotel is a well appointed hotel that seems out of place in its surroundings it is relatively easy to find just off highway 101 it is close to the metro so you donât need to drive to the walk of fame on hollywood blvd or universal studios the hotel has good vegetation around it that makes it look good i got a large and comfortable room on the ground floor it was a bit noisy next to the back entrance with the elevator opposite but not too noisy that i failed to sleep the room is well equipped with closet and kitchen area the room had an iron and board microwave oven refrigerator and safe there is a coffee make but it makes only a single cup of coffee there were ample towels and toiletries there was a flat panel tv with options to pay for movie rental the pool;4
finding a good hotel in nyc can be treacherous finding a decently priced hotel in a good location seems almost impossible until the jane came along we booked one of their bunk bed rooms as for once we didnâ´t want to pay an arm and leg for lodging in nyc and 125 a night is almost unbeatable while checking in we were told we were upgraded to a captains room meaning that we had a bigger room and our own bathroom instead of a shared bathroom which was definitely a nice surprise even though we ended up in a more expensive room we enjoyed the service and atmosphere in the hotel regardless of it the people at the front desk were friendly and helpful and the interior design is unique and in line with the history of the building and the location is unbeatable if you want to;4
i generally stay in midtown when i go to ny so it was nice to be somewhere dfferent the empire is right on the edge of central park which is beautiful this time of year columbus circle is a fun place to be around as well the hotel lobby is nice with a bar right off the lobby the room was fine and the bed comfortable the shower was great although the bathrrom overall was small i would stay again;4
absolutely amazing the rooms were luxurious so comfortable and it was a perfect location for the nyc half marathon we were just about a half mile from the start which meant we could maximize our sleep the night before and getting back after the race we took the 23 train to lincoln center i loved crawling into bed after the race for a nap with the most comfortable down blankets to curl into the large corner suite made post race stretching for my 69 boyfriend bearable i would recommend this to any runner coming to the area it was a perfect location and a great place to stay;4
travelled to new york end of october for the new york marathon with family of four the new yorker is a fabulous art deco hotel with lots of history our first night was a little rocky our room was incredibly small and the shower didnt work we were so impressed with the front desk staff when we put our complaint in they were incredibly helpful and had us moved into a larger room with an incredible view the next evening no questions asked we know they were very busy this weekend and they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable the new yorker is across the street from madison square garden which is a top notch facility i would recommend taking in a sporting event so fun we were within walking distance to times square as well the subway was right;4
ok this is not a hotel with services if you want that go find another hotel if you want a very reasonable place to stay with a kitchenette no daily maid service great location in a good neighborhood for a great rate try here we are the types only there to sleep and then out very happy clean etc;4
what a gorgeous hotel and very helpful staff we turned up 10 mins before checking in time and room wasnt ready told to come back in 45 mins after an hour the room still wasnt ready after a long flight we just wanted to get into our rooms and seeing how stressed i was a very helpful muhammad at reception sorted me out with a room for our inconvenience also gave us a very nice upgrade a room with a view empire state building no less the room was spacious and clean only disappointment is that there is no teacoffee making facilities in the room unfortunately our safe in the room was not working and the kindly let us have a safe behind reception until they managed to sort the problem out the hotel is in a fantastic location just beside times square and all;4
great location and value many dining entertainment and lots of new york at its finest nearby;4
i stayed a week with my teenage daughter the staff was friendly our room spacious and clean the pool on the top was very small donât expect to swim but quite refreshing after a day in the city wifi came and went very cool lounge area on the roof white wine was served in a disposable water glass come on that is a nogo at 15 usd but in bar area on the floor below good cocktails and wine were served in real glasses but basically good location and value;4
nice hotel close to most of what we wanted to see the suite was nice and cozy with amazing views only issue i was emailed unsolicited that i had an upgrades suite with early check in but when i arrived the suite was not ready so we waited 45 minutes in the lobby the suite was worth the wait for the view;4
the hotel is close to the lincoln center and central park and within walking distance of times square broadway shows and the avenue of the americas the hotel was clean and the staff helpful especially the concierge wifi was available in the lobby and mezzanine but the light in the mezzanine made it very difficult to read great view from the window of the room of the lincoln center and all the cabs coming down the street;4
the location of this hotel is great for new york city its perfect there is a 24hr diner next door and a subway station too the rooms are comfortable and well equipped i would definitely stop here again;4
the lobby staff was very nice especially the concierge david bowie the room we stayed in was a good size for two we were three and managing four would not allow for large baggage the room and hallway was very damp which could be explained by the lack of ventilation in the bathroom the lobby was very nice and the roof top bar and club ok however the bouncers at the club where note very pleasant even with these âfaultsâ i would consider staying there again just to have access to edâs chowder house which was fantastic;4
the lobby is beautiful and the rooftop restaurant has a great view there is free wifi in the lobby but its quite expensive to have it in your room the rooms are small but they are very nice great location just a few minutes from central park;4
we stayed at the hilton universal city for two nights in a standard room upon arrival we were warmly greeted by all staff members and check in was friendly and efficient the room was spacious and of good quality the tv worked well and the bathroom was large the bed was very comfortable the hotel continues to have issues with the elevators which seem to have dragged on for over 12 months now but the staff do there best during peak times to assist in my experience we only had one occasion where we decided to take the stairs all other times we didnt have to wait too long the staff at this hotel were amongst the best we have experienced on our three week trip the only negative about this hotel was no free wifi this is rare considering everywhere else provides;4
people who goes to nyc and dont wanna spend money in hotel this one is a good choice its simple small comfortable clean and the staff is helpful an old man on our first morning receipted us with a good morning in our language that was really great and cool theres no luxury but its secure the internet connection is paid but its great in a city that you wont find a lot of places with good free wifi nearby metro stations 110th in front of central park its located in a residential area that have a lot of babies schools crossing the park you will be in the 5th avenue;4
i was hesitant after reading so many negative reviews but here i am relaxing in a pretty nice family terrace suite with an amazing view of the city contrary to what others have said the beds are comfy clean the bathroom in clean and well stocked even the sofa bed is nice and as new as any other hotel sofa bed we have a dining table fridge great tv reception comfortable climate control and the room smells nice fresh the hallways coming to our room are also nice fresh is the hotel old yes is it luxurious not exactly but for its time yes its pretty darned awesome as with any hotel we practiced general rules no bare feet and dont assume its just like home thousands of people are in and out no matter how fancy the hotel is im hoping my photos prove;4
i booked a room through hoteltonight at the empire hotel in nyc for one night with the intention of watching the nutcracker at the lincoln center the location is spoton for the intent with the lincoln center being right across the street when i checked in the front desk service was impeccable specifically josã© who upgraded my room to a suite at no charge due to availability josã© was also very helpful in ensuring that i got the best experience possible while in nyc offering numerous tips on where to eat and what to see the only downsides of the hotel stay were that the shower was missing its sliding door which made showering a little uncomfortable and the elevator to the fitness center took a long time due to its location and the elevator not being used exclusively;4
we stayed at the hollywood hotel on vermont st for a few nights and were pleasantly happy with our visit we got a great rate for our room it was very basic but clean with a nice view of the courtyard this is the perfect place to stay if you want a cozy and private hotel the free breakfast was great and chef hugo couldnt have been nicer and so pleasant also every time i went to the front desk i was greeted by gisel and her friendly smile she was so helpful and upbeat made us happy to be there overall a great experience;4

travelling to nyc in spring or fall is an expesive business during these popular months hotel proces in manhattan go crazy so any hotel that is clean safe and less than 200 a night must be good value we stayed 3 nights at the windsor on the first night we were on the ground floor and it was very noisy the next day we requested a move to a higher floor which the staff arranged for us without any problems the following 2 nights were less noisy and we slept well the hotel is clean the facilities are basic but overall the hotel delivers good value the hotel is located in china town and close to little italy we had no problem with safety or security and the hotel is only about 150m from a subway sation that gives direct access to midtown the subway was always busy we;4
this is truly a 3star hotel not too fancy needing a little updating however the location is superb across the street from lincoln center short walk to columbus circle and central park and in a very safe area you cant beat the location and the price we were in a junior suite which was large by most hotel standards much less nyc standards i would definitely stay there again and our whole family really enjoyed the stay;4
we really enjoyed the great room amazingly nice staff and location of the hotel the breakfast buffet was excellent and a great value to add on to concierge level rooms it is a topnotch property and we will definitely return;4
so our west coast adventure begun with our first stop being los angeles we decided to stay at hilton universal city as it was the perfect location to me after researching it was central for what we wanted to do to get to hollywood or to santa monica depending on where and what we were doing this hotel offers a free shuttle to universal city walk and if you miss it its just a short walk to the city walk we booked with diamond rewards card to check in there is a special desk thats exclusive for diamond rewards members checkin was swift and prompt the staff was very helpful and friendly there is no executive lounge in this hotel for diamond members rooms were spacious and the beds as with all hiltons iâve stayed in before were very comfortable room amnesties;4
we have stayed at the empire off and on since 2000 im not sure what year they redecorated but it was badly needed and a good job was done in the space available the bathrooms are very small and have only showers the decor is very trendy and the lobby warm and lively there is a very popular club on the roof terrace which attracts lots of young people but we stay there because it is right across the street from lincoln center we had a wonderful view of broadway and columbus plus the lincoln center plaza from our room it snowed a lot so it was great fun to see the snow and watch how new york handles bad weather there are many nice restaurants within walking dinstance including eds chowder house inside the hotel and pj clarkes on the corner because it was;4

great looking hotel vintage in places very friendly and helpful staff rooms are a decent size view was beautiful everything was great in the room bed shower tv all great gets very cold of a night and had to have the heating on which means not a lot of sleep as the units they use are very loud but other than that brilliant stay;4
amidst the pandemic i needed a hotel to stay until i could return home this hotel was well poised wrt location so i booked it the hotel amenities and covid protocols were very good i could see persons cleaning in the lobby all the time mandatory temperature checks and hand sanitizer on every floor however when when i had questions about reservations neida was the person she made me feel very comfortable when i had question about literally anything she always had the time to discuss any issues i had and always a person to her word meeting a person like here during this unusual time we are in was very welcoming i would highly recommend this hotel great location and staff;4
did a quick day trip to universal studios and hollywood since i dont enjoy driving back late thought wed spend a night here paid a little more for an executive level room but was unimpressed save your money as other reviewers noted its a close walk to universal and citywalk we arrived early and were able to check in right away service was exceptional from front desk to housekeeping we had to ask for an extra towel and they offered us additional soap shampoo and lotion overall a pleasant experience;4
it was a quick one night stopover was very impressed with the experience room was very spacious comfortable bed good wifi connection i worked late so decided to visit the hotel restaurant the menu was somewhat limited but the food was good and the service great;4
me and my wife stayed for a week our first visit to nyc we had a great time the hotel is in a great location the view there was none but if you can get a room with a street view the room was a ok size not too big and not too small the bed was very comfortable the pool deck was under construction when we went so we didnt see anything there very nice and cozy overall i would recommend this hotel to my friends;4
location hotel is located about 30 minute drive from lax and around 510 drive from chinese theatre theres a metro stop close by some shops and restaurants near the metro despite what other reviewers say the area is fine and did not find it at all dodgy even at night but as its east hollywood it all seems a bit sketchy first impressions room the room was adequate overall it was on the ground floor facing the road but was quiet it looked a little dated with old furnishings but was clean tv worked well and the bed was large quite high but slept comfortably the bathroom was also dated but amenities were adequate the water did not seem that hot though ok for a shower but not for a bath facilities the hotel has a restaurant in the basement it has quite nice decor;4
this hotel is right across the street from lincoln center and only a few blocks from central park the rooms are nice and well kept the only weird thing was we didnt receive a top sheet on our bed other than that the staff was friendly and helpful;4
i booked this hotel for 5 nights on our arrival the room was not ready yet but the guy at reception desk mohammed finally granted us to another room we were upgraded to an upper room on 36th floor with a great view on the empire state buildin thanks a lot the new yorker hotel is very well located in midtown perfect to visit the town;4
we stayed in this hotel june 2012 and it was of very high standard the rooms were lovely and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in breakfast was delicious with 2 omelette makers to make whatever omelette you wanted i found it great that you could also choose between egg whites or whole eggs the gym was a little bit small but apart from this the hotel was great and we enjoyed our stay;4

i was really scared after reading all the horrifying reviews on the website upon arriving i was pleasantly surprised to find the lobby clean and friendly we had the standard king room on the 8th floor but it was really oldtimey so we asked for the 60usd upgrade and it was so worth it we were put on the penthouse and the room had everything we needed it is a fantastic location for couples looking for a cheap yet quaint stay in manhattan it is located right by a 24hr coffeeshop with anything from breakfast to dinner offered any time during the day we had a romantic dinner at one of the many charming local restaurants near the hotel you will be fine irene she is irish with lovely long dark hair is a wonderful front desk clerk that will take care of you i had;4
the hotel is located in upper westside it is across the street from the lincoln center there is a starbucks that opens really early which was great giving jet lag i had a junior suite which was large enough staff is very friendly and you can have an exclusive access to the rooftop if you stay at the hotel;4
ive stayed here on business several times over the last few years and ive found it to be overall very good ive stayed at much better places but for the budget and location it provides a nice and stylish slightly outdated comfortable place to base your visit from great location to hells kitchen broadway and the park id come here again if i were wanting to find a budget friendly and nice experience that put me squarely in midtown;4
as many said this has good location since it just a few minutes walk to the subway the place is quiet and safe the stafffront desk are quite helpful and immediately address your complaints such us remote of tv is not working the wifi is good and its free even in the hotel room the room is clean the not so good thing about the hotel was on my last night housekeeping did not put in the new bedsheets but instead just left them on top of the bed they did not replace the supplies in the bathroom either i guess because i forgot to leave a tip when i left the room but i planned to do it on the day i left anyway because they were rude about it i did not leave a tip at all;4
the location is great right next to penn station and near times square quick check in and the staff were very friendly the room was clean and welcoming we had a great view of the skyline which for me is what you look for in a new york hotel the bathroom was a little bit rough around the edges but overall fine the hotel has a lot of history and is an iconic place to stay with its art deco theme the price is reasonable for the central location cheaper places could be found out of downtown or with a budget hotel;4
good safe place to stay people were friendly and i would stay there again the room i was in did not have a lot of street noise so was able to sleep well staff was friendly and kept the room clean the four days i was there view from the window was not great the room seemed to be a little dark even with lights on;4
the hotel is nice we stayed there for a couple of nights during a vacation in la the front desk guy was all nice until we decided not to buy the bus tour tickets from him the room was really nice clean and tidy with a balcony theres a teacoffee making facility a fridge and toiletries in the bathroom the breakfast was excellent as well i couldnt understand the location of the hotel though but theres a subway station right there at the corner with a relatively easy system to figure out and go almost anywhere you want it was a very good stay overall;4
we chose this hotel because of its style and location walking distance to madison sq garden penn station bh photo empire state remember this isnt the most modern hotel but its been kept fresh and clean things like abundance of outlets and lots of room around the bathroom sink arent why you come to this kind of hotel the diner on the ground floor tic toc diner is a great value and convenient;4
the hotel was very nice with exceptional guest service âgeneral storeâ had good snack options more than any other hotel iâve stayed at the parking for check in at night was horrible and extremely frustrating cars were lined up and parked where i needed to go to unload baggage and check in parking if you can find and fit in a space was 40 per night which is ridiculous;4
very clean hotel very friendly staff especially the reception and dining staff we used taxis to centre of hollywoodabout 15 minutes ride and about 15 would have no problems recommendingthanks james;4
when i travel for business i have to stay at corporateapproved hotels and this was on our list for nyc proximity to the subway lines were important to me and this hotel is very well suited for public transit if the weather were bad you could even cut through the tick tock diner attached to the lobby to reach the closest subway entrance my recent stay was for nearly 8 days and my corporateapproved rate only allowed me to book a room with a single bed at checkin the front desk clerk noticed the length of my stay and upgraded me to a room with more space i have stayed in many ny hotels and they typically have very small rooms but this was one was small even by ny standards and the clerk said he gave me the biggest room available i imagine the extra space came in;4
dena at the front desk is awesome in fact everyone was very nice it was a little loud the first night however after that was okay the room i was in was a bit dated but large the price was good and even though the neighborhood was a little sketchy in parts i walked around with no problem it is a convenient ride away to universal studios etc;4
traditional hotel great staff and superb location one block from central park two blocks from columbus circle accross the street from lincoln center rooms and bathroom are small and for an extended stay can be a problem gym is just averagenice rooftop for drinks;4
we stayed for 2 nights at the new yorker room was super clean a bit tight for 4 adults but only in room to sleep so it was fine had requested high floor with a view and this was given to us staff very nice expect the bathroom to be small but has all the necessities parking right across the street very practical and discount when staying at the new yorker we definitely recommend great location right across msg;4
my boyfriend and i stayed for 7 nights at the days inn during late september 2014 i am unsure of they have nonsmokingsmoking floorsrooms however at night we noticed we could smell people smoking in near by rooms this wasnt necessarily an issue for us but should be consisted when booking a room for people who are asthmatic another issue we encountered was the elevators there are four elevators i believe 2 of which were broken the whole time and the second set was extremely slow and when it did arrive usually had a heaps of people in it which meant you had to wait for the next one so we climbed 7 flights of stairs at least twice daily however despite these issues the days inn is located in the most beautiful area there is a cafe literally across the road a;4
this hotel is in a great upper west side location right across the street from the lincoln center and very close to several good restaurants and close enough to other good uws restaurants and attractions we were happy to see that the lobby and mezzanine were redecorated although the rooms are cozy read small if offers good value for the price and if you require more room book a deluxe king;4
this was a business trip so i did not pay for the room i cant give any impression on value for price for me the most important thing about the hotel was it was an easy walk to work so it was overall just fine the empire hotel was a lovely hotel though iâm not sure iâd ever stay there if i wasnât alone the room i was in was tiny the room was dominated by the queen size bed with just enough room to walk on either side of it there was also a flat tv on the wall a skinny desk though itâs surface was covered with stuff with a desk chair and a storage ottoman flat against the wall when you came into the room everything was furnished to make it look luxurious so it had a very appealing look it was more than enough for me and i had a beautiful view of an air;4
was pleasantly surprised by the hilton universal city it appears to be newly renovated with a lovely lobby and wellappointed guest rooms the shuttle runs around the clock to universal studioscitywalk or its a 7 minute walk friendly and helpful staff from check in to bellman we loved our parkview room you can see the lights at harry potter world i would definitely stay again if i were going to universal;4
the location of this hotel cannot be beat it is a few minutes walk to universal studios and city walk lots of places to eat and lots to do i used points to stay here and i dont think we would have stayed there if we had of paid cash for it it was really expensive for what you got there was construction but that did not bother us at all the elevators were really slow but there were many of them the room was large and the bed was wonderful i had an amazing sleep there the view from our room looked right universal studios which was beautiful in the night my only real issue was the door that was located between rooms i understand it is meant for if a large family is staying in 2 separate rooms and they have easy access to the other room as we were a couple and did;4
good hotel nice and confortable rooms very good free breakfast nice swimming pool but the rooms should be more soundproofed all external noises were quite disturbing both from the street and from the inside of the hotel slamming doors private parking available but slightly expensive 10 usdnight i would like to mainly thank the 2 receptionists at check out on august 24th nicole beatriz who were kind enough to extend our checkout time with no additional charges;4
this hotel is an excellent location 12 min walk to the empire state and times square next door to the subway 5 mins walk to macys we had room 2139 which had a lovely view onto the empire state building staff were helpful and very friendly rooms were cleaned daily only complaint is the 25 per night facility fee this covers use of the wifi in the room calls and use of the business and fitness centre the wifi was poor for at least 5 of our 6 night stay slow wouldnt load pages etc that we resulted in using international roaming we had no use for the business centre nor the fitness centre and as for making calls we utilised this facility only to get our moneys worth this was a really disappointing aspect of the hotel the restaurant next door tick;4
this is a very clean and quiet hotel each room has its own private bathroom which is not always a given for the rates you get here no frills no free breakfast but a good tv comfy beds and friendly staff since youre in new york city restaurants are everywhere so you can grab breakfast just 2 blocks away they have an earlier than usual check in time 2 pm and check out time noon twenty minutes from lga by cab thirty to jfk;4
very good hotel the room is comfortable and well equipped with a huge bathroom the staff was helpful and kind the wifi worked beautifully both in the hall and in the room great position close to times square and metro stops;4
we stayed here for 3 nights and found it to be not a 5 star hotel of course but on the whole pretty good for what we paid through expedia even for their standard rates it would be a decent deal the room was clean housekeeping did a great job each day felt safe and had a nice biggish bathroom cable and access to cable internet for a daily price we got a nonsmoking room and it actually smelt like a nonsmoking room ie no stale cigarette smoke the breakfast was plentiful and the staff were really friendly helpful access to a laundry within the hotel was great the neighborhood wasnt totally upmarket and the car park was a bit open but it was staffed well and we had no problems and felt safe definitely a good place to stay especially if you can get a deal;4
good hotel in the crossing of 54th street and broadway one of the best places if you are interested in theatre live music or other cultural activities a lot of restaurants cafes and subway stations around at night its a little bit noisy if you are staying at the lower floors we chose a big room and it was worth the higher price to have that space in the center of the city we barely didnt had any relation with the front desk team just checkin and checkout but elena was pretty helpful on those occasions;4
the people saying underwhelming things here forget what nyc hotels can cost this place squeezes every dime out of what they bring in small rooms yes shared bathrooms yep but come on for the very low price this place is super clean the people were nice and the neighborhood is great this is in nyc and you wont be sitting in your room all day anyway its clean and safe and actually quite nice for the price;4
weve stayed at better hiltons with lower prices but this one gave us what we needed we were in room 1273 and had a view of the wizardry world of harry potters castle if there were ever any night time fireworks this would be a great room the elevators are still slow but learn to work with it as they are doing renovations the tram that goes to city walk and universal approximately every 15 minutes is a major plus as you save on parking we skipped the buffet as some said it wasnt worth the price it turned out ok as we met up with friends we hadnt seen for years for breakfast but next time we would definitely do the buffet it was endless with choices for a family who has one person who is vegan one gluten free and one who is just picky 5 star luxury no 5;4
enjoyed our stay at this hotel we booked 2 adjoining rooms both were clean and spacious the location was great a short walk to universal studios and city walk shuttle service is available but we did not use it reception staff were friendly and helpful conciege service seemed more like a tour booking service not very helpful or knowledgable;4
the opportunity for early checkin was wonderful and the staff helped to secure us a room with a view the room was fine however would have loved one with a larger bath i have stayed here before and love the location close to penn station and dining facilities are great;4
as a hyatt globalist they upgraded me to a great suite room very spacious and the interior details were modern and contemporary front desk was great and noted my loyalty the gym has the main star a great view of the tarmac of lax the only flaws i experienced were the lack of valet attendants and the breakfast attendants i hope they can work this system out better for valet it would take 1520 minutes for a car to come through;4
we have stayed here at least 8 times right across the street from penn station rooms are great and clean and we love the tick tock diner and also the italian restaurant that i cant remember the name of we had a fabulous meal there before our show highly recommend the new yorker mohamed checked us in and he was wonderful;4
have watched this property for years but could never quite justify the rates when towing a brood of 4 kids this year however it was just husband and i so we thought treat yo self what a great decision it was the hilton at universal city has to be one of the closest hotels in terms of proximity to the park a dedicated shuttle services operates daily and is shared between both hilton and sheraton it picks you up at the front door and drops you conveniently into citywalk for the short stroll to the front security gates check in was reasonably smooth we had added an extra night to our booking a month prior so there was a little bit of negotiation with the room assignment due to the hotel being fully booked our desk agent managed to sort out things and we were ushered;4
for someone staying on a budget in new york for a few days and not planning to stay in their room for the time there this is perfect rooms are quite clean bathrooms are fine too possibility of storing luggage even before and after checking inout the staff is professional very near to a subway stop walking distance of the cathedral of saint john the divine worlds 4th biggest church nice to check out the price suits the place ie shouldnt be cheaper nor more expensive for nyc however watch out for the elevator smells more than bad also dont relly on them for a wake up call;4
i stayed here with a friend for 6 nights we were on a slight budget and got ourselves a double room with a queen bed this was absolutely fine for 2 but we found that the room was a little cramped and there wasnt a great deal of space for 2 large suitcases the breakfast buffet included in the room price had a great selection and we made the most of this every morning to set ourselves up for the day on the waffles sausages eggs toast bagels fruit the immediate area around the hotel is not really ideal but since we had hired a car this allowed us to get around very easily the hotel is very well situated very close to the griffith observatory hollywood blvd and the farmers market its also just over 1 hr to santa monica and venice beach its definitely;4
the hotel is located in the center of manhattan everything is at walking distance what else you need in new york the rooms are clean and decent there is a long queue at check in but it is very fast very good house keeping services;4
comfortable rooms with good beds and a generous bathroom with good counter space great common areas off lobby with good seating parking is accessible and sufficient it is at the top of a huge hill so walking out is not so easy but its california everyone drives everywhere near lots of restaurants and shopping and universal city attractions easy access to downtown la via rt south which is very close to hotel site good restaurant in the hotel and service was fine the hotel is petfriendly but you cant leave pets in the room when you go out;4
we were concerned because weve read mixed reviews about this hotel but were very glad we took the chance location is great for lincoln center and central park checked in at 100am and had no hassles with the process in fact they upgraded us without needing to ask we asked for extra towels and toiletries so that we wouldnt need room service and someone from housekeeping arrived at our room within 10 minutes housekeeping came the next day and gave us more toiletries just because we like loccitane products and put a magnetic sign on the door so we wouldnt be disturbed nice touch since the door hanging signs fall off very busy highend nightclub on weds thurs fri and sat but no noise reached our room at all rooftop pool is nice and bartender up there is very;4
the empire is relatively large and affordable by manhattan standards the staff are efficient though not overly friendly the rooms lobby and hallways are clean more important the rooms are larger than expected i would only warn guests that the coffee is not complimentary the location is outstanding as it is near lincoln center the uws and a subway which allows you to get around the entire city;4
if you are looking for a hotel near universal studios this is the best option this hotel is very near to it although theres a shuttle from the hotel to universal studios you can actually just walk and youre already there i just hope that there will be a shuttle from the hotel to the universal city red line station because it is quite a distance to walk down from the hotel to the lankershim blvd;4
our room was wonderful although the view was your topical ny roof tops it was within a couple minute walk from penn station and 9 blocks from times square and the shows there is the tick tock diner attached to the hotel for breakfast and other meals as well as a decent italian restaurant for dinner we had a wonderful time the only thing id recommend is that they paint the halls and rooms something brighter and uptodate;4
rooms are a little small though it had all the necessities you need the tv remote worked intermittently during our stay which probably is due to its age the location however was perfect walking distance to attractions like times square and with many food options around it is very central too which made traveling about a breeze;4
very nice woman at checkin lovely room sensational view love the lobby bar for preshow cocktail and snack perfect location for our night at the opera especially considering the snowstorm the only negative was that our room was too warm for cool sleeping and we couldnt open the window;4
my wife teen daughter and i stayed here for spring break the staff was great especially the concierge when planning a day trip for sightseeing he gave street addresses so we could plug them into our nav system universal studio is only a 5 min walk away i would have given them a 5 rating but there was only one mirror in our room in bathroom a mirror outside the bathroom would have made getting ready in the morning much easier especially with two females;4
near metrã´ station vermontsanta monica and in walking distanceto the griffith observatory 1 hour walking organized and clean atentious staff very good rooms with microoven and cafã© sugestion bring your forks and knifes;4
old furniture and comodities but clean good room service staff polite and helpful air conditionning set almost everyday to 60 f 16âºc by room service but easily adjustable to a warmer temperature located close to central park in a nice area with nice restaurants for breakfasts and dinner subway trains 1 2 3 direct to south manhattan station at the corner of the street very close to the hotel our room was on the 5th floor and wifi worked perfectly;4
after reading few negative reviews about this hotel we were a bit afraid of what we could get butwe only have good things to say about it it is sutuate just off broadway street away from the busy street very near the metro subway restaurants coffee shops starbucks around the corner with free wifi and a supermaket with a nice deli section definetly good value for money you cant go wrong if you dont expect luxury but a basic clean and quite place to sleep after your day walks;4
my wife and i stayed here for 4 nights from 7th august 2016 the room we were given was 210 on the second floor we noticed the aircon was noisy as soon as we entered the room to which we turned off only to be replaced by an droaning type noise we then drew the blinds to be confronted with a view of brick walls and aircon units from which the other noise was coming from we did inform our travel agents that we wished for an room at an higher level so i returned to reception and told them that the room was not suitable and the reasons why not a problem sir came the reply and within minutes we were allocated room 821 on the 8th floor above the main entrance with a great view the reception team were warm friendly polite and very efficient as were the entire staff the;4
stayed at the jane with my 17 yo daughter and it was perfect easy walk to buddakan for a wonderful dinner and a short walk to chelsea market in the morning for great coffee and breakfast we loved the decor of the hotel and the front desk we got a bunk bed room which was actually smaller than my closet at home it was tiny smaller than a cruise ship room it was what we were expecting so we were not shocked it was so small my daughter took a picture and posted it to her facebook page and got several comments we had no problem with the shared bathroom didnt run into anyone else using it we prefer to stay at inexpensive clean hotels that are in great neighborhoods because it allows us to travel more often we also enjoy quirky places with lots of character and;4
very nice hotelthe bed was king size and comfortable enough the pillows were fine all rooms appear to be exactly the same dã©cor and i loved the enormous mirror the hotel is just few blocks from central park and times square;4

my partner and i travelled to nyc for a 5 night break to celebrate my 50th birthday arrived at the hotel and were greeted by friendly reception staff our room was on the 26th floor and overlooked the empire state building which was a short distance from the hotel although the room was small it was clean it had a queen size bed ensuite tv and phone what more would you need the new yorker is midtown and close to many tourist attractions madison square gdns empire state broadway macys times square to name a few penn station is literally across the street and gives easy access to the subway to visit uptown and downtown ny there is a gym and a 24hr diner tick tocks an italian bar trattoria bianca all within the hotel the staff on the information desk were;4
this hotel is in a great position for site seeing the hotel is very clean and our room was nice and big we had a double double room it is ready for a refurb but having said that is does have that old world charm if you are reasonably fit you can walk to most attractions or the subway is only a 2min walk away i would defiantly go tooths hotel again if i was going to new york;4
the hotel is is perfectly placed to take in all that new york has to offer with most of midtown manhattans attractions and land marks in easy walking distance the staff are brilliant and really helpful we left our bag in the taxi as we were checking in and the reception couldnât do enough for us to try and trace the taxi all be it to no avail we were also given complementary breakfast in tick tock diner for the duration of our stay which is brilliant the blue berry pancakes are a must the room was clean and tidy although it was a little small and the bathroom could do with a little modernising but nothing that was a problem all in all a great hotel for a great trip;4
our room location was quiet and comfortable room service was good nice medium sized room and bathroom close to subway and central park heating and air conditioning worked well nice little refrigerator;4
i stayed at the new yorker for 4 days we had to move from pensylvania hotel wich was awfull btw to this nice beautifull and cozy hotel wich was a great improvement from where we were staying first our room was a little small but nicely decorated and very clean just be aware that there is a 29 extra daily fee for staying here at the end it was kind of worth it very friendly staff breakfast is not included as most ny hotels couple of blocks from penn station which is a plus there is a cvs and a very nice pizza place also across the street definitely going back specially if we got a special price ð rates are not cheap check out the view from the hotel see pic;4
proximity to airport and free airport shuttle are a big plus i was glad to find the shuttle immediately outside the baggage claim and promptly checked into my room after almost 21 hours of flying getting back to the airport was easy;4
i travel to nyc for business every month i have tried out several properties in midtown and found the ameritania to be my go to hotel the hotel is clean comfortable and the staff are what truly make this place now dont start thinking the rooms are palaces this is nyc and hotel rooms take full advantage of space to maximize high rent and high costs so some of the rooms at this property can be tight and others are spacious the beds are platform and while not my kinda bed for home they are comfortable decor is a funky charm the location cannot be beat for times square and midtown west now to the staff i have stayed here over 15 times in 3 years and the staff are what makes this a great place i hope corporate treats them well 3 staff on this visit really went;4
the hotel is near central parc and near the subway ð and the area is pretty quiet the rooms have an old style they really need some renovations the staff was really nice and helpful and the room was always well cleaned;4
we stayed in this hotel for business earlier this month the location is perfect for us as it was near where we needed to be for work the lobby is incredible a real art deco beauty we were also incredibly impressed with the staff it was some of the best service weve received from hotel staff in years checkin was incredibly smooth and fast the gentleman who works in the mail receiving room is amazingly friendly and helped us dispose of some packaging after wed picked up a large package the gentlemen who work at the little coffee and pastries stand in the lobby were very welcoming every morning the hotel is huge and serviced by multiple elevators so despite it being a busy time to stay we never waited too long for one our room was small as is typical of a lot of;4
my wife and i wanted to stay overnight in manhattan after spending a few days on long island visiting family we booked through hotwire the mystery 4star hotel and were assigned to the new yorker so heres my thoughts on this hotel check in starts at 400 but we arrived around 11 we were given the option of paying for early check in 5000 which we were willing to do at that time we were given a room on the 25th floor which had a pretty decent view of the empire state building room if youve read any of the other reviews im sure youve picked up on that they are small and small was an understatement hell even the front desk clerk mentioned that the room was on the small side we had a queen bed and there was just enough room to move around it;4
i stayed at thi hotel for 4 nights with a group of friends we had 2 rooms one for 4 and th other for 2 i was on the first one the room was clean spacious window directky to the street you can go and seat at the window have a cigar there bathrooms are clean is not a luxury hotel but we were looking for a cheap place in order to save money for other things in ny so it was perfect for us we paid 89 dlls each for 4 nights something bad first floor have an area with bad smell but if you are not picky you will be able to ignore it;4
we have stayed at the empire hotel many times usually for a long weekend its the perfect place to stay for ballet or opera just walk across the street to lincoln center there are several good restaurants within two or three blocks when we wanted to get across town the frontdoor staff did a great job getting us taxis quickly this is one of the things that makes the empire more convenient than the larger fancier places the room was clean and comfortable the desk staff including sophy who handled our checkout were friendly and efficient;4
we stayede 4 nights 2 adults and 3 kids the hotel was overall nice and clean and that includes the pool the room was formfortable and spacious staff was very polite and helpfull breakfast was good with freshly made omeletsthe area was not the best with a lot of homeless people in the streets but that wasenâ´t a problem even at night time we walk to griffith park and hollywood walk of fame so the hotel i convienient located if you are not afraid of a little walking distance overall the hotel is good value for the money in la we paid about 180 a night including a rollerbed;4
my expectations were not high in this part of the city for this price though i would have a tiny room that had some sort of issues but i was delighted to find an extremely comfortable urban chic room with a lot of light and even a view very comfortable bed the elevators are small and the lobby can get a bit crowded with guests from around the world but my room and other hotel amenities were great only thing is the wifi went in and out but i never asked about it and tried to get help;4
happy for a few reasons the hotel far exceeds the ones i was finding in a similar price point only a work trip but wanted to be in an easily accessible part of the city and feel like i was in a hip space i got a great rate too i didnt experience the issues i read about and have no complaints about my room it was quite large with a separate seating area from the beds room 312 very nice if youre traveling with more than one person the bathroom is smaller than you might expect but this didnt create an issue the shower was a rainforest type with good pressure and temperature nice toiletries too the restaurant is under renovation and i couldnt order room service but this is new york i ordered from the smith across the street i did had a small glitch;4
the jane is my comfort zone in new yorks far west village if it was any farther west it would be in the river i love this place for its boho chic vibe and the friendliness of its staff i arrived early on my latest visit and the front desk let me leave my bag with them while i wandered off in search of lunch the restaurant was closed for renovation but there are plenty of nearby choices for food the meatpacking district is only a couple of blocks away and there are other options as well as usual i stayed in one of the standard cabins sure they are small but with the apple at your doorstep the only thing to do at a hotel is sleep the restrooms and showers are down the hall and the hotel provides robes and flip flops for travel between the statue of liberty is visible;4
stayed the first night in a stark shabby room upon asking to be moved we were given a lovely room with ac sink fridge widescreen tv clean sheets towels walk in wardrobe very quiet and bathroom facilities only a couple of doors away on each side of room i found this hotel perfect on a budget its not luxurious or fancy but served its purpose perfectly staff were helpful we were not rushed to check out nor was there any curfew i would recommend this hotel to those on a budget who want practical accommodation information stand in the reception area has fliers on everything there is to see and do in new york which was fantastic hairdriers are available upon request at reception overall glad i stayed here i could not complain about any aspect of it once we moved;4
hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful location is great its just by the subway and you can walk to every major tourist spot eg times square boardwayetc even though the hotel is a little dated it still worked out very good im lucky to get into the premier terrace family suite on 38th floor room size is good and the view is stunning facing the empire building special thanks to lynn and linda in the front desk so nice helpful;4
perfect if universal studios is your main priority for staying ten minute reasonably strenuous walk to universal or the shuttle runs approximately every 15 minutes very helpful concierge staff i was very happy with the standard of the room and the cleanliness the buffet breakfast is really lovely and a great way to build yourself up for a full day doing the tourist things freshly squeezed orange juice was delicious great wait staff room service menu was good especially when catering for children and service was prompt i also very much appreciated the range of goods offered in the conveniencegift store in the foyer for last minute items as you are not very close to other shops reception desk staff could have been a little more welcoming and hhonours points;4
i loved my stay at the janeso much so that ill be going back for a few extra days this week it has a charm and a style that is all its own fantastic area close to the subway with easy access to everything nyc has to offer resturants bars and stores staff were helpful and unintrusive everything is clean and well cared for yes the rooms are teeny tiny but you know that when your booking so no complaints from me great place for a decent price though dont forget about the tax on top of the chargeit can surprise you at check out i think the cafe is a little pricy but its a great space with vegemite toast on the menu for those seeking the best hangover cure on earth and the service is hit and miss the bar is also a great space but a little on the;4
stayed her for our minimoon for 4 nights over new years great lobby room was nice albiet a small bathroom space for one person and thats it had complimentary strawberries and chocolate brought up to us the first night 25min walk to times square just over the road from central park the concierges were fantastic so friendly and knowledgeable busy on new years eve but that was due to hotel nye party upstairs didnt bother us we still had a sleep up until 11pm and then went out to central park for midnight fireworks;4
this is an excellent hotel if you need to be in the area if your appointments are elsewhere its not very convenient do not order the nachos from room service they will arrive soggy and gross with fake nacho cheese goop all over them disgusting hilariously the day i was there the hotel seemed to be simultaneously hosting a bunch of christian tshirtwearing fundamentalists and a group of orthodox jews i can only imagine the elevator awkwardness;4
stayed here for 4 nights great location helpful staff and very comfortable rooms the hotel is within walking distance to the flagship macys store i will definitely stay at this hotel again when i return to ny;4
great experience great customer service i had troubles opening the door and came downstairs for another room key the front desk was very pleasant and sent security upstairs to ensure i was about to get inside definitely staying here again;4
from the basement to the penthouse every room is nice clean modern and well maintained the basement has what they call terraces patios to you and i also very private for the entertainment industry guests the high floors offer panoramas or views of the movie studio check in is easy and painless the bar is exquisite and for the smokers you can duck out a side door for a smoke;4
i really love this hotel if you plan on doing anything at lincoln center this is the hotel to stay in it is right across the street from lincoln center the rooms are smallishbut that is nyc however the rooms are clean and modern the bed is luxurious with tons of big pillows and a thick down comforter the decor is updated and stylish the bathrooms are done in an asianinspired decor and very luxurious my favorite thingthis sounds crazybut i love the loccitaine toiletries the bar is really lovely and a cozy place to grab a glass of wine or cocktail before heading out lots of comfy but not frumpy couches with little tables and candles everywhere a romantic place to stay;4
stayed at the empire from 4th to 9th june staff were fantastic really helpful and welcoming room was lovely clean and spacious overlooking lincoln center the food from room service was great and orders arrived promptly and piping hot shower pressure was great as well elevators were out of service quite often which was a little frustrating but the general level of service hotel location and facilities more than made up for it the roof terrace in particular was lovely great to go for a quick dip in the morning with breakfast before heading out to see the city the location was particularly great and there was very little external noise outside so evening though you are a stones throw from central park and broadway it felt much more peaceful there is also a;4
staff could not be more helpful with everything from directions to printing off tickets for us some of the decor was a little tired and in need of an update in the corridors and in the bathroom the communal areas were to a high standard though;4
as the title says location is wonderful penn station across the road ideal if you are flying into newark room was very disappointing room 3304 tiny with the smallest queen bed it was also freezing cold unless you had the very loud very uncomfortable air con on this would make the room unbearably stuffy staff were very helpful we asked for an extra blanket which arrived within minutes sorry we did not ask the first night also got extra towels had an issue with the toilet and again janitor arrived in minutes could do with a facelift but can see that would cost millions overall itâs location and friendly helpful staff make it a great choice for ny and excellent value for money;4
this hotel was clean and tidy all be it a little basic the position is fantastic just on the edge of central park close to the metro and we were even able to attend a free concert at the local cathedral around the corner put on by the new york philharmonic orchestra the staff were friendly and helpful;4
the hotel is situated right across the road from central park to get to time square its a sub ride but that was no problem as the subway is a couple of blocks away i loved the idea that the hotel was not in the heart of the city so if thats what you want then book a hotel closer the hotel itself because thats what reviews are supposed to be ie not location was a great place okay the rooms are a bit dated and smaller than what we are used to in europe but i stayed 5 nights and had no issues whatsoever the staff are only to be congratulated on their friendly and helpful attitude and we always felt very welcomed we used the hotel as a base for sightseeing i certainly didnt go to nyc to sit in a hotel room i can do that much closer to home i enjoyed a good nights;4
first impressions were not very good had to call up reservations to update my credit card but the other person at the end of the line sounded like i was bothering her however it was different at the hotel stayed in 862 from the moment you step in you are treated very well the room was clean comfortable the showerhead wasnt very good though the water just sprays everywhere housekeeping knocked on the door of the next room at about 745am and it was loud and clear didnt like it that wifi wasnt free even though we pay higher for this hotel overall comfortable stay;4
first off i love cool unique historic and artcreative inspired places and experiences so the jane appeared to fit most of the features the positives built in 1912 and still exhibits much of its original charm the staff was exceptional friendly helpful and fun they all dress is cool period type uniforms which adds to the charm even though there was no ice machines on the floors they would deliver a bucket to us whenever we asked the hotel was exceptionally clean even though there are shared bathrooms they were constantly being cleaned by the staff each toilet and shower is individually enclosed with the ability to lock so the bathrooms are shared by both men and woman our particular room was facing west so we had a nice hudson river view;4
i stayed as a solo traveller two nights at the empire hotel in late sep and it was a very satisfying stay cost conventional wisdom is that hotels are much cheaper outside manhattan and to a certain extent this is true if you are driving in it might be cheaper staying outside and newark airport area ewr probably serves well however if you are flying in and want to avoid the harrowing driving experience in city staying in manhattan is the best option i did some investigation and hotels in jersey city are not that much cheaper at least the ones which provide easy access to the city the subway is 225 per trip and is very inexpensive and you can travel anywhere in the city for this cost i got this hotel for around 160 per night and that is a decent price for sep;4
the hotel is super convenient about a block from penn station and madison square garden staff were friendly and helpful the room was a little small but very clean and comfortable the only complaint would be the lack of working elevators we were on the 26th floor it appeared that most guests were on the upper floors even though there were a bank of elevators that went to 20th 40th floors only a few were working in the mornings all elevators were packed supposedly only 10 people can get on or it will get stuck we ended up using the staff elevators to get down to the lobby;4
hollywood hotel was a very pleasant surprise it has been up graded and renovated on the interior room was well done it exceeded my expectations a gated parking lot with an attendant is available for nominal cost cars come and go no additional charge i would recommend a stay here we would be happy to return in the future;4
just returned from a 4 night stay at the new yorker would highly recommend it the room was quite big for new york standards was one of the cleanest ive ever stayed in the staff were all very friendly helpful checking in out was very quick easy even with the busy time of year we used new yorker rides for our transportation to from jfk airport this was arranged quickly efficiently with louis at the desk our driver was josh he was extremely helpful couldnt have been more friendly rates were reasonable only slightly more then we would have paid for a yellow cab well worth a visit already planning our next trip;4
we stayed here for 4 nights while exploring la and universal studios the rooms were a good size very clean and well maintained the location was perfect as it was walking distance to universal studios and we ate dinner every night at the many restaurants on the universal citywalk;4
the jane is a budget hotel with a lot going for it the ambiance is totally uniqueelk heads and peacocks are stuffed on the wallit has an excellent roof bar where many trendy new york socialites gatherthe downstairs bar is a bit more involved and on the weekends its pretty crowdedi had no problem getting into the hotel as a guest and the doorman at the downstairs bar was pretty cool in my experience i had a cabinwhich as previous reviews as said was smallbut it was comfortable and i had more than enough space for my things and it was very reasonable considering it was columbus weekend shared bathrooms wasnt a big dealhardly saw anyone when i was using them its a bit of a hike to the 14th st station but uber and lyft were always available;4
the hotel was very clean however it was very difficult to figure out how to turn things on in our room the decor was ultra modern and was not attractive our toilet made a horrendous noise when it was flushed a lightbulb was burned out in the light next to the bed and it was hard to figure out how to turn the individual lights on in the room there is a key that goes in a slot when you come in the room that turns the power on in the room so that the air and all the lights will come on there were no instructions on how to operate the tv that said when we called there was somebody that came up immediately and fixed the toilet and showed us how to operate the lights the little cafã© in the hotel was very good and we enjoyed our pizza and salad the lady that made the pizza;4
very friendly people at the reception good beds very nice breakfasy only thing if you have a room at the side of the street you will have a lot of noise also the neighbourhood is not so nice but i have nothing bad to say about the hotel;4
glad i made this my first ever hotel in the united states friendly staff upon check in room nice and clean with nice shared balcony overlooking courtyard room is for the most part quiet and the guests that stay here are mostly middle class tourists so no problems with excessive noise and riffraff breakfast is above average with a choice of omelette pancakes cereal juice and coffee which is included in your fee room made up everyday without fail although i slept in very late will be back sidenote station is full of homeless and beggars but that occurs in most tourist areas in the us probably best not to use buses and trains with the kids pot smell everytime i walked the streets;4
the accommodation was comfortable and very conveniently located with the subway station within a five minute walk the only slightly negative thing was we found the bathroom was generally a bit dated and the shower was very antiquated nevertheless we enjoyed our stay and the breakfasts were substantial and way above the average fare in many us hotels around this price range the front desk staff were super friendly and helpful and a particular shout out for pil who was always cheerful and especially helpful would be happy to stay here again;4
hotel is lovely and very clean staff are friendly and helpful enough shuttle to universal is so helpful and the walk isnt far either room we received was lovely and a decent size however we were given an accessible room for some strange reason as it was not requested or needed so we were given a wet room instead of a shower which was a pain as the whole bathroom would be wet could hear people in the lobby as if they were in the actual room wasnt much of an issue as it wasnt stupid oclock when it happened was just oddly loud compared to other hotels the only other and not really surprising downfall is that the shop inside is very overpriced for snacksdrinks;4
very spacious hotel room and friendly staff close to airport but very quiet so easy to sleep good food in bar area and 24hour cafe available there is a shuttle bus between airport and hotel every 15 minutes;4
the hotel is in a great location close to penn station and the best of new york city the hotel is very safe and my room was super clean and modern i stayed in a queen suite and i couldnt be happier with the room it was big comfortable and quiet on the negative the hotel seems to nickel and dimed you throughout your stay starting with a daily facility fee of 29 and ending with a charge of 2 per bag for storage after checkout as long as you understand and you are ok with the fees and they are clearly disclosed in their booking engine this is a great place to stay in manhattan;4
we just went to nyc april 2003 and our stay was wonderful although the room was small it was immaculate and compfortable the location is excellent close to everything you want the staff was friendly and courteous the free continental breakfast was a real plus i was impressed the price for this new york hotel was fantastic i will definately be going back;4
this is my second time that i have stayed in the new yorker itâs pretty basic itâs clean the rooms are small the pricing is reasonable and the location is great not much else that i have to say other than the fact that i would use this hotel again if i visit again;4
i previously stayed here in 2012 and now in march 2016 the hotel is still the same the location is great got a great deal with transponders the staff were pleasant and always helpful my room was next to the lift and i was a little worried at first but i didnt hear it at all i really like this hotel the wifi in the lobby is free and i found it to be pretty quick and connected straight away the rooms are lovely and in my experience its one of the biggest and nicest standard rooms ive stayed in whilst in nyc they also have my favourite soap shower gel co bigelow lavender mintits amazing i would definitely stay again and again;4
this is a perfectly fine midtown hotel in a central location it has been recently renovated with a modern decor the rooms though are small even by manhattan standards be careful walking around the bed because you are likely to hit your toe on the bed frame or on the huge mirror along the side the bathroom has absolutely no counter space the checkin desk seemed a bit chaotic but we did not have any problems;4
on the hottest day of the hottest summer i ditched my apartment jumped on the subway and checked my family including our dog into the empire hotel so that my kids could splash in the tiny cold pool on the rooftop while i sat on the side with my legs in the water the hotel is in a great location right across from lincoln center check out the amazing dancing water fountain at night with lots of good restaurants right nearby the smith has great food and is very dog friendly its a quick walk to central park and right on a great subway line that will take you anywhere the rooms are very clean they are not fancy but they have great air conditioning the lobby is lovely we were all very happy for our staycation experience at the empire and will definitely do it;4
from the moment you walk in you know this is not a typical hotel the atmosphere is one that you dont see in a chain hotel there is a new york posh feel but not stuffy it looks like a lobby is supposed to look inviting and not just the 1st floor i stayed in a junior suite so i cannot complain about space though i chose this to have plenty of room the bed was comfortable and the furniture was a nice change of pace the only downside is that the desk is directly below the tv its uncomfortable to work on a laptop and watch so i just turned the tv off there is noise from the street but my room was facing broadway so honking can be expected at all times of day the food options are limited but you are in new york city finding a restaurant is not a problem;4
stayed here for one night while we went to the haunted houses at universal walking distance to the park and lots of great stores and restaurants hotel was great room was amazing everything was clean and bed was comfortable would definitely stay again only reason im giving 4 stars is because parking is a little bit expensive if were paying over 200 a night to stay in the hotel there should be cheaper parkingvalet;4
the priceservice relation is very good the rooms are always clean and comfortable the staff of the reception is very friendly especially the armenian woman dont know her name and naturally devon he would be able to draw someone out of the deepest depression also the man in the hotel kiosk was always very friendly and accommodating the breakfast is fantastic and offers a big choice the hotel pool is situated behind the hotel a calm place to relax surrounded by many plants restaurants and supermarkets are reachable on foot in a few minutes;4
fantastic location near central park and a host of other landmarks somewhat basic in content but reflected in the price the ameritania was just the ticket for us big thanks to jeff the door man for courtesy and advice;4
my wife and i along with my daughter and son in law are just back from a 5 night stay here the location is great just across the street from the lincoln centre very close columbus circle and central park and the subway a 2 minute walk from the entrance and buses almost on the door step the lobby is sumptuous with a nice cosy bar good music and a relaxed vibe in the evenings check in straightforward and a very helpful concierge we found the front desk to be helpful but the lifts were a bit of a problem the room was ok with two nice sized beds a good shower and a big screen lcd tv some of the furniture was looking a little tired but overall the hotel was fine i have an issue in this day and age that wifi in the room cost 13 a day and was free in the lobby and bar;4
we spent 4 nights the hilton universal city opting for this resort as our based camp to circulate around la the best location if you plan to hit the universal studios a shutlle will drop you at the universal citywalk every 15 minutes or walk it takes 6 minutes close to hollywood and beverly hills 5 minutes from sunset bld so great the rooms are not so great a bit old double beds instead of queens bed which is a shame as it is not very confortable no space for a rollaway bed neither the pool is very nice large with a great jacuzzi maybe a bit of painting necessary but the pool was never too crowded the food very nice great experience the food options are amazing try any of the buffets on friday saturday or sunday brunch amazingly tasty we;4
we stayed at this hotel in jan 2012 for 4 nights hotel itself is quite nice rooms are spacious and clean staff were friendly enough but didnt provide a lot of insight as to how to get around or provide much advice on the surrounding area location is ok given its only about a block walk to the metro station to head to hollywood bvld and universal studios however theres not really anything much within walking distance of the hotel other than a few restaurants about 7 blocks north on vermont ave breakfast at the hotel was included in the cost of the room however it was very basic so we didnt bother after a couple of visits wasnt great actually if you are wanting to stay in hollywood i would recommend this hotel as it was fine clean and the rooms are spacious;4
great location get off the train and only a block away about a 510minute walk to time square and all the local attractions subway station just outside the doors and a great bagel place a block away liberty bagels other then the fact the rooms were small everyone there was great hostest;4
i like the hilton hotels this one is very nice my wife won a trip to la to visit wb studios and see a taping of big bang theory this hotel is in a great location for access to these events and was paid for as part of her prize package we stayed in room 1657 a one king bedroom on the 16th floor because i am a hilton honors gold member they gave us free executive continental breakfast for the two days we stayed oct 8 9 surprisingly the fact that we were paid guests at the hotel and an hh gold member they still would not give me free parking i felt this was a bit of a slap in the face i mean seriously you pay for a room and you have to pay again to park your car the room was very nice huge with a huge bathroom clean and very comfortable bed refrigerator;4
excellent place to be residing for a short term its only 3 minutes away from the station which is in a shopping mall packed with amenities the rooms are plainly decorated but are clean stayed on the 2nd floor with the view facing the sunset quite a romantic view if you block out your mind regarding that youre in a hostel the hostel has friendly staffs who are more than willing to help you i highly recommend this place;4
first impression was a little scary as the photo above is not the street view street view is simply a drop off point and had us freaking out thinking we had been duped but hotel and staff were very nice comfortable bed and nice tile floors in rooms breakfast buffet was really good pool was nice but we mostly just slept here figured out the bussubway and we were off both are about a block or so away beware there are lots of homeless folks and free clinic patients in the area but for the most part we always felt safe the big blue scientology building is near and we used it as a reference point more than once all in all it was nice and we would probably stay here again;4
we spent five nights at the new yorker this was our first visit to ny and the hotel made our trip perfect with its great location near well almost everything the hotel itself was beautiful and the staff very helpful train station and subway are next to the hotel making it easy to move around lots of restaurants and cafes nearby and also pharmacies to get some late night snacks to your room we had breakfast at one of the property restaurants and oh my what a treat a good selection of dishes diner style the gym was also extensive so you can easily do your your fitness routine there they also had a business center where you could print out tickets to shows etc for free so many pros and only one con the shower was awful no pressure and if someone showers or flushes;4
i stayed at e wyndham new yorker hotel for 4 days from end of october 2015 for four nights on a trip to new york city with my mum we chose the hotel for its location which was very convenient for seeing all the top manhattan sites very easy to get to from jfk airport by taking the skytrain change at jamaica station then the long island railroad to penn station the hotel is less than 5 mins walk from penn station its also virtually opposite madison square gardens 5 mins walk from macys and about 10 mins from the empire state building hotel has a lot of history and is decorated in the art deco style with nice details throughout we had a very large room on the 28th floor overlooking the west side of new york and the hudson river room had two queen size beds 2 closets;4
i enjoyed staying in a clean newly appointed room in this centrally located art deco hotel subway very nearby as well as major attractions decent exercise room 3 good restaurants attached to the lobby depending on the types of meals you are looking for;4
i like the empire i have stayed here several times the rooms can be warm due to the radiator heaters but i tend to like that and if you dont you can always open a window the rooms are not large but it is nyc after all the only bummer is no bathtub just a shower but thats not a huge deal the staff is always friendly and it is clean;4
though i mainly booked this hotel due to an offer at the time of booking made it incredible value for money i ended up leaving there thinking i will probably book it again next time im in the city the area is very busy and crowded but its also very close to big attractions and super convenient for travel youre right by penn station and it made it so easy for us to get to and from jfk airport and any manhattan location we wanted or needed by bus or metro i didnt try the diner on the ground floor but it looked popular and the hotel staff was friendly and efficient at checkin despite the crowds i received my keys already at noon which was a pleasant surprise as i had mentally prepared myself for quite the wait until 3pm but the cheerful receptionist took care of that;4
all the staff was very good great service rooms are small but very clean great value if youre just in town and need a room not many restaurants in the area but you are right on the edge of central park;4
an excellent hotel with a great location our room wasnt huge but was comfortable and sufficent as a base for us all staff were friendly and helpful the tick tock diner is located on the ground floor of the hotel and is open 24 hours and has a varied menu the subway system we found confusing even for the locals we were asked for help by one of them;4
i booked this hotel with my son for two nights itâs good for travelers who had flights and need to take a rest before the flight we had clean wide room and big bed to sleep the location is near to the airport you need a car or a ride for moving in la;4
location is great yes it could use a little sprucing but the people working there are great the desk the front door the maids etc were all great very considerate helpfuli would definitely stay there again;4
ive been here for 3 days in june with a friend pros great location really close to a major subway stop just a few blocks away from central park and dakota apartments the neighborhood upper west side is one of my nyc favorites since it is close to everything mainly by subway but you can stroll to lincoln centre columbus circle and without the chaos of more touristic areas in midtown great delis and cafes around too good value for money room clean and spacious with respect to the average of nychotels free and working wifi in rooms the guys in the lobby were always professional and helpful although we didnt have specific or particular needs and kept our luggages for an extra 8 hours after we check out without any problem cons the structure needs a;4
my wife and i have stayed here on 3 separate occasions since 2009 service is always top notch love the large jacuzzi for morning soak and wake up excellent base camp for exploring our favorite places in la griffith park burbank topanga canyon just dont confuse the buffet which spreads out all down the corridor for free bar goodies you will get your hand slapped figuratively cannot speak to value as we have always used hhonors rewards for our stays;4
i enjoyed my stay here the hotel is beautiful the location is good i didnt go to universal across the street but i did go to the city street to shop and eat i took a taxi that cost about 16 to the walk of fame i took the metro back for 2 the room was clean and comfortable the bathroom was a tubshower the bathroom towels were big and fluffy bed was comfy with lots of pillows i would recommend this hotel for a nice stay;4
one of the nicest and wonderfully priced hotels iâve had in new york i traveled here for a birthday celebration and the location was walking distance from a subway station and great food i would definitely book again also shoutout to jeff for being so kind and helping out during our trip;4
service was very good we got good view corner room room was little dated but was very big ambiance was little dated as well but we didnt plan to stay in the room for much of day so didnt mind walking distance from universal studio so was very convenient if you are visiting universal studio otherwise it was in the middle of nowhere breakfast was awesome but because i am diamond hhonors usually i get free breakfastthough i am supposed to get only continental breakfast free but usually all most of the hilton hotels give me full buffet breakfast free but this hotel was very strict and i had to pay extra to get full buffet breakfast they didnt do anything wrong and followed the policy to the book but it was annoying for me because i had to pay extra so not their;4
this location cant be beat walking distance to so many great attractions for touristing around the city front desk and bellman services were excellent pasquale at main desk was very helpful room service breakfast was topnotch rooftop bar area a lot of fun my only complaint was the lighting level in the room itself particularly the bathroom which was dimly lit;4
this is a beautiful hotel you have to trek through a maze to find it but once youre in its gorgeous paradise there is a central fountain tiers of the roof with pools and couches to lounge on and look at the city the food is amazing they have a free laundry service the rooms are beautiful my only criticism is that its a little hard to get anywhere you need a guide to get to the taxi stand and its probably one of the priciest places weve stayed that said we loved it and had an amazing time felt totally safe and they went above and beyond to make us comfortable the dinner we had at the hotel was one of the best on our trip love it;4
this is a large art deco style hotel in a very central location for getting around new york it is very close to penn station which has good transport links we used this station to get a train directly to newark airport which was much quicker and less expensive than a taxi the hotel has a spacious and imposing lobby with more than enough lifts to get you to its many floors this is a busy hotel which is used by groups as well as business people and tourists and there is sometimes a queue at the check in desk we found the reception staff efficient and helpful and our requests were dealt with promptly the quality of the bedrooms varies depending on the type of room you book some have excellent refurbished bathrooms and modern decor and others have rather old fashioned;4
reasonably priced double room with shared bathroom and toilet the room was very clean comparing the prices of the private rooms in other places in manhattan this was a very good deal it had a fridge sink cable tv double bed and enough storage for clothes had no problem with the staff the only issue which i had was the internet it is extremely slow on some floors;4
expectations were high but the pool was very small and housekeeping needs improvement the staff should be on the same page re roof top access and we couldnât charge to our room as the system was down however it was a great location and the door staff were amazing;4
real unfriendly reception and extremely expensive breakfast but room absolutely ok with good air condition and clean shared bathroom enough place for my luggage and all my stuffs though the tiny room;4
terrific bed havent slept better in ages in town for childs audition at julliard which is literally a block and a half away so convenient to lincoln center with great dining options all around rosa mexicano is a must try and easy walking distance to carnegie hall times square ed sullivan theater central park etc citibike stand twenty feet from the door great price for what is presumably off season;4
this was my second visit to the hilton universal city with the previous visit way back in 2010 i have to say that not a lot has changed in this hotel since i last visited it clearly it is the best location for universal studios however if you want access to the metro you will have a very long walk down the hillwhich had massive roadworks when i was there having said that the big starline tours bus makes a stop here if you want to go to hollywood in terms of amenities the hotel is nice has a fantastic outdoor heated poolhottub but probably getting a little tired in the building itself however they were renovating the breakfast area whilst i was thereso clearly they recognise that things need to be updated a bit in terms of staff i think they were very obliging;4
this is a big old hotel in mid manhattan close to everything you have walking distance to all major tourist attractions on manhattan super close to the subwaystation and madison square garden we stayed here for a week and it is an old but well managed hotel everything is made in old style the beds are good and the room is clean we got a magnificent view over empire state building from our room tv with a lot of channels beware of the accomodation fee for wifi ang gym;4
location is perfect itâs near subway and train stations restaurants are walking distance from hotel broadway times square too right across my room are the view of madison square empire state building and rockefeller centre;4
my famjly and i during our visitwe stoped this place for 3 nights more than a year agoi got a warm services from those staffs and and my family was also happy when we leave the hotelit was amazing and fantastic being therethanks;4
the place and the team that works in hotel are awesomehotel are very recommendable in a set of advantages conditions like the both am but some maintenance problems must be improved to get a excellent status for overall;4
it would have been a 55 but the first room i got given had construction vehicles on the road below that beeped for hours i asked to change rooms the man on the desk said a comment about being in new york which i understand as iâve been a few times before but nobody could have slept thru that i took a video it was bad anywayafter changing rooms it was nice maids came everyday the safe broke after a couple of days but it didnât bother me lifts werenât as bad as iâd read about a few minutes wait at most i would definitely recommend location is the best;4
stayed here for work location 4 minute walk to universal studios city walk no need for the shuttle food outstanding buffet im very picky about hotel food but this place did it right bar great menu friendly staff good prices for a hotel rooms they were good could be freshened a bit staff good attentive check in took way to long;4
we arrived to be upgraded to a bigger room which was great the rooms are comfortable and warm the staff were very nice it is close to good restaurants columbus circle and the subway the walk to times square is a good 15 minute walk but a good way to check things out there is a duanereade chemistsupermarket next door for anything you need and a deli not far away too and a starbucks on the corner the rooftop bar was a nice place to have breakfast buffet style for 20tax;4
spot of for walkers and people in couples not really a child friendly hotel we didnt eat there as we found the prices were too high and we could eat on a budget around various locations in ny for a more well rounded experience and not at all far for this on arrival rooms were ready in time as stated and the bar was really cool to come down from long flights the hotel looks very glamorous in the lobby etc and the decor is well thought out to provide people with an extra special getaway the room was a great size for ny some wallpaper looked a little shabby in our room but overall it was fine for a place to sleep air con worked like a dream strange shower system but who cares about that only downfall really was the officious manner of one of the reception staff he;4
first of all i have to agree with some other reviews regarding the size of the room we stayed inits the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in but to be honest it did not bother us too muchall we wanted was somewhere to lay our head and it was most prob one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in the hotel and rooms were very clean and the location was amazingliterally a 5 min walk to central park and a 15 minute walk to time square and right opposite the lincoln centrewe stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and if we come back to new york we would like to stay here again kate and matt;4
we stayed here with our two kids in the heatwave of july 16 we were so glad of the roof top pool although it was somewhat reminiscent in size and shape of a sheep dip still there was a bar next to it so everyone was happy the hotel is a great location in terms of walking to central park or to the subway and the kids loved pj harveys next door for dinner;4
hotel is in a great location across the road from penn street station and maddison square garden 15 blocks up and one street across your in the middle of times square rooms are very small but your only there to sleep so ok the lifts are the biggest problem there seems there are only 2 working out of a possible 6 or 7 if your up on the right hand side of the hotel as you approach the lifts so you end up waiting quite a long time for the lifts apart from that the hotel is fine for a four or five night stay as we did;4
good hotel but slow internet and a small elevators but the location of this hotel was superb very near to the metro station near to a lot of restaurants staff were very good and helpful nice bathroom;4
very conveniently located near the airport which is exactly what we wanted there are very few food options near the hotel but the food at the hotel bar was surprisingly good the staff were friendly and the room was clean exactly what you would expect from an airport hotel;4
everyone employed there was very helpful friendly and professional got a corner room on the 25 th floor and the view was amazing did not eat at the 24 hour restaurant but their desert case appeared to be top notch i would definitely stay here again;4
our room with 2 double beds was more thanadequate the bathroom was small but shower great with good water pressure beds very comfortable had 2 windows could see chrysler building from one room was quiet and clean carpeting in hallway a bit worn and signs of wear and tear present in hotel subway stations within steps of building;4
i ended up with mixed feelings after my stay in the jane as it was divided in a period of 4 nights and one more night after a visit to chicago the first series of nights i slept on the 6th floor the top floor at the end of a hallway so nice and quiet the room is terribly small as can be seen on the website one wall consists entirely of a mirror with a rod and some hooks above it so itâs easy to cover up iâve passed the point where i want to see myself in the mirror all the time there are some cupboards under the bed a plank both at the foot end and above the bed that serve as even more storage space so once youâre sorted it becomes possible to cope with the tiny space there is a fan that serves pretty good as an air cooler a tv with a reasonable amount of;4
stayed over after a concert at msg perfect location just across the street make sure to book a remodeled room;4
we stayed here for 3 nights as part of our trip to universal studios and were immediately impressed with the hotel stuart at check in was fantastic he was welcoming and engaging and a great asset to the hotel our room was clean and large and housekeeping was perfect the interior of the hotel was beautiful and the shuttle to universal was an awesome bonus all of those contributed to the 4 stars given i would have really loved to give 5 but i cant for 2 reasons 1 prepare to wait on the elevators there are times when the doors have to open 4 times before there is any room seems ridiculous since we have stayed in larger hotels with only 5 elevators and never had a problem maybe they should consider assigning 2 elevators for floors 112 and the remaining;4
woo go is a great place to stay if you want a reasonabll cheap place to stay in ny very close to subway three minute ride to times square great supermarket down the road cant understand bad reviews this place is not a hotel if you want room service and your bed made up everyday book into one its like a little home away from home make sure you ask for an upper floor no noise;4
stayed at this hotel for seven nights and found it was very comfortable clean and quiet the complementary breakfast is a nice bonus and provides a great variety including eggs to order the price of the hotel makes it a viable option in expensive la the downside is the location which is a little undesirable however the transport connections are excellent with the metro and bus closeby the pool on site and available off street parking are great extra benefits staff were very helpful at all times particularly michael g i would definitely stay here again;4
we stayed on the 29th floor the room was quite and comfortable the hotel staff were friendly and were helpful with any problems or enquiries they have a lovely tick tock diner attached to the hotel as well;4
on the one hand i have to agree with other reviewers who said that the hotel is a bit worn the rooms slightly small and the walls seem to be thin on the other hand this hotel has a lot more charm and character than most the location is terrific and the staff at the check in desk the concierge and housekeeping were extremely professional courteous and helpful i would definitely consider coming back we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the new yorker;4
a nice hotel that was extremely convenient for our early flight out the next morning it was a very easy hotel choice with great staff who were dedicated to ensuring my stay met or exceeded my expectations;4
i stay 5 days in total sleeping in three different rooms as a summary it is a very nice place to stay with very friendly and helpully people nice homemade breackfast but with some points to be taken into account 1 practically you need to take the aiport trasfer service because the riad is not very easy to find it after the first time you can manage it even you will get a mobile just in case you need help 2 you must not too bother of group of young people in each coorner in that part of the medina they are at their own business and do not bother you 3 the rooms do not have wifi connection only there is a free wifi near the reception as i have say before i really enjoy it;4
walked into the jane hotel dining room without reservations and was seated in a non reserved section i quite frankly couldnt tell the difference between the seating this is an old hotel that must be undergoing renovations because of the scaffolding on the outside the one restroom ran out of toilet paper with no extra rolls and no air freshener now in my opinion theres no excuse for not having these items in the bathroom no matter how old it is we ordered a small cup of coffee a cup of tea and shared a slice of warm bread pudding which was not as good as described cost about 1600 excluding a tip perhaps some violins in the sound system would have made the meal more enjoyable the help are probably getting good tips and at the very least should ensure that;4
county hall premier inn is ideally located not far from many central london focal points and 5 minutes walk from waterloo station its an attractive historic building from the outside and a modern comfortable hotel inside very clean bright and welcoming and probably one of the best premier inns we have stayed at the room was a good size with all the conveniences you would expect only two minor points neccesitate a score of 4 rather than 5 firstly that there was no shower cubicle just a shower over the bath the shower itself was good but its always a little awkward clambering in and out of a bath to use one does anyone really take a bath in a hotel room secondly the public loo style toilet paper dispenser pretty rubbish constantly struggling to get paper out;4
we stayed here for three nights and overall it was very good the room on the 24th floor was a little on the small side but had a great view of manhattan and the hudson the room looked a little tired and could have done with a lick of paint but that could be overlooked due to other factors using the lifts was a major source of entertainment as it usually meant a long wait to get an elevator going the way you wanted staff were always friendly and helpful the location next to madison square garden and only a block or so from macys and the empire state building is excellent and left reasonably short walks to all amenities a subway entrance is right next to the hotel an enjoyable stay and would love to go back;4
we stayed there this weekend and we were greeted warmly by the doormen as well as the front desk we valet our car for 60 night close to the lincoln center starbucks cafe fiorello columbus circle we checked in and were upgraded to a junior suitewhich was lovely clean great view albeit noisybut its nyc only issue was the lack of towels we had two without wash cloths and the shower had half door which made getting warm in the shower difficult and not luxurious when you pay as much as we did you expect the basics of towels or wash cloths they should for the price have turned down service comp 12 bottle of wine flowersetc instead they give you bottles of water for 7 or nuts for 11 to purchase in your roomnot classybut it is a nice place to;4
i only stayed for a night over the thanksgiving weekend and i found the hotel to be nice the staff always greeted with a smile and were helpful the room was nice and well furnished the location is fantastic it was well priced i thought it was a great experience the only downer was a moving toilet seat however that was only very minor to the experience thanks for a great night;4
had a interesting ride from jfk in minibus last on coach to be dropped off traffic nightmare but saw quite a bit of the surrounding area hotel has a lot off character we are on 28 floor lift look old but the workings must be new as they are quick the room are small but fine for us bath small but original fixtures if your over 510 take a shower prices for basics are exspecive so take note we paid 2 dollars for a small czn of coke not the normal uk size beds comfortable can hear some noise from next door rooms and the tv was rubbish but that was no major issue 3 dont drink water from hotel placed in rooms as you can see quite expensiveapart from these moans a must visit at some time and dont forget walking shoes;4
love the new yorker it is a great old hotel with small rooms and a nostalgic feel the location is good for business or vacation the tick tock diner is 24 hours and sends stuff super fast to your room i have stayed there many times the rates were more reasonable before wyndham took them over but i understand the rate hike what i dont understand is how they can leave the public areas shabby and outdated a nice retro remodel would be good and if i am going to pay the higher rates then give me a reason fix the lights in the new yorker sign outside and make it the grand old hotel it used to be i will still stay there but hope wyndham is investing too;4
stayed here five nights and had a pleasant stay overall the staff was so friendly from the cleaning staff to the doormen we were pleasantly surprised the location canât be beat right across the street from penn station so the whole subway system was easily accessible our standard room was small as we expected for manhattan but it was in need of some updating fresh paint would do wonders for the price i would stay here again;4
very nice hotel absolutly loved the courtyard view gorgeous excellent front desk staff as well besides the location of the hotel we had a wonderful time here and enjoyed every minute of it;4
after reading the reviews my boyfriend and i were not expecting much but we were delighted by our room when we arrived i have no idea what these people are going on about the place is perfect as a cheap hotel thats relatively pleasant and a good location you wonât find anything better for what they charge per night the room was clean we had clean towels and soap everyday and we had our own fridge and cable tv the bathrooms were always immaculate and located very close to all the rooms we hardly saw anyone on our floor as for people running into undesirable tenants in the hallways it is new york and the people may be a bit different to whatever backwater usa hick town youâre from great restaurants close by close to the subway and we always felt safe walking;4
i was visiting nyc and stopped by the bar for a quick drink since i saw it on tv and michael was the manager and asked how out visit was i thought it was great that the manager stopped by our table to see how we were doing and we were not even guests of the hotel our bartender andrea also did a great job making drinks for us all night i would highly recommend this bar to any of my friends to stop by and check out;4
lobby is just as pictured check in was quick and easy room was tiny it was just over 10 feet by a little under 13 feet very small bathroom with one glass shelf as there isnt counter space on pedastel sink a little bit of mold was in bathtub soapdish view from 24th floor on 34th street side was not impressive proximity to penn station for subway could not be beat you could take exit from subway in the rain and never get wet getting to hotel bed and pillows excellent good water pressure and hot water plentiful safe in closet was nice to secure valuables during day rate was lower than other similar hotels i would stay there again but would like to compare a different hotel if i go back facility fee was only 1099 a day which was less than i expected;4
the front desk was courteous the bellmen were very attentive and helpful the room was clean there is no in room coffee pot but downstairs they had coffee hot and ready all the time so that was no issue there is no ice on the floor but a call to the front desk and a bucket and ice is delivered as a courtesy so this too was just fine i had an enjoyable time and the room is a decent size for manhattan;4
excellent location and an absolutely huge room this was a very convenient spot to stay the night before a meeting in waterloo there was a bit of noise from outside but once my trusty earplugs had been shoved in all was well the breakfast was fine and most of the staff were quite friendly check in was a bit slow and neither of the self service kiosks was working all in all though i slept well and would stay again;4
having read some of the notsochoice reviews of this hotel i was somewhat concerned about what to expect however i was pleasantly surprised ok so it isnt the waldorf astoria but how much can one expect for such a reasonable price in nyc terms at least i arrived earlier than planned at 2pm but my room was ready and i was able to check in straight away the room was a reasonable size by nyc standards but small of course by other standards but as a seasoned nyc traveller i was impressed by the largerthanexpected size of the room the good clean easy location subway on the corner so felt safe as a single woman nice enough rooms not too noisy even though i was facing out to the street the bad only one small radiator under the window didnt really;4
we had a top notch wellappointed room for one night at this hotel it was quiet comfortable and very relaxing the hotel is located close to penn station and good parking garages access to the lincoln tunnel is also excellent there is a great diner restaurant and a superb italian restaurant off the main lobby cant be beat;4
set just off the bottom of central park this uptown location is peaceful yet still central my girlfriend and i stayed here for 3 nights on a quick trip from the uk over christmas it is close to the 59th and columbus subway station which can get you anywhere in manhattan for 275 if you go at christmas it is just a beautiful 5min walk through the park to the ice rink the room was small but clean and warm air con and heating is controlled by lifting a flap of the duct a couple of people have said they couldnt control the heating the mini bar is expensive even for hotel room service 8 for 500ml water but there is a pharmacy just on the broadway side of the building that is much more reasonable staff are lovely and will help with any issues you have and give;4
i honestly do not think the hotel is as nice as it seemed online however it was a very good value the neighborhood is not the best i wouldnt recommend gettiong back to the hotel after dark if you using the subway which is conveniently located 12 mile away the breakfast is by far the best part of the experience hugos omeet station was fantastic the pool was very nice the hotel was clean jermaine and anna were extremely helpful at the front desk i would stay here again and would recommend it to others traveling;4
great price great location friendly staff quiet roomgood shower bed comfortableonly complaintâ they put a 15000 hold on my debit card for incidentals which screwed up my card for uber ridesâthat should have been explained in better detail upon arrival;4
really like the breakfast the chef can make eggs any style for u the pancakes and waffles are very tasty too the parking in the gated area is very costly but you can park by the road side by entering quarter into the machine;4
i was in nyc with girlfriends and we had 3 rooms at the new yorker one suite and two double rooms all were on upper floors check in was very easy and we were able to access our suite upon checkin even though we were early the lobby is nice but the halls when you come off the elevator are in need of update new carpet and paint would go a long way to improve our suite was a good size with three closets pull out sofa chair small fridge and sink no microwave or coffee maker the bathroom was small but sufficient the bedroom had 2 double beds not queen but we knew that when we booked there was not much dresser space but we werent in need since we were only staying 2 nights the double rooms were both on the same floor and each had 2 double beds the;4
was already familiar with the neighborhood as familiar as one can be with nyc after 4 years away so i knew this was where i wanted to stay very limited lodging options in this neck of the woods but i fully recommend it to get a true local experience no sign out front in this quiet again relative residential street as others have noted a safe area but dont be careless clean and basic felt like a dormitory almost myself and two buddies got a standard triple room with one full and one single bed tight quarters for 3 grown men but it wasnt awful reasonable closet space dresser fridge small tv hanging from the ceiling fresh towels and soap daily beds made up did not have a private bath but rarely had to wait to use the one on our floor kitchen;4
i just returned from a fiveday stay at the premier inn in london county hall and it was fantastic the room was outstanding the staff was wonderful and the breakfast was amazing i also took advantage of a meal deal on the last night which included three courses and a drink for each of us for the price of two the hotel is located on the south bank close to the london eye and other nearby attractions;4
clean quiet room on east court open to broadway some street noise but good windows was cramped at 8 pm bed was changed to nonallergenic just 20 minutes after request only second door from elevators but never heard them main ones out an hour one afternoon though on third floor fifth story no noise from inside building;4
the empire hotel is not fancy but it is clean and friendly and reasonable for new york city the rooms are small but that is typical of new york it is right across the street from lincoln center which makes it a great spot if you are going there;4
we would really give this hotel a three and a half out of five this hotel is all about the location which is right in the heart of new york and with a five minute walk from the empire state the rooms are ok the bathrooms are old fashioned but have a great shower and our bed was on the knackered side of acceptable get a room as high up as possible the lower floors will be very noisy and ask for a room with a decent view the first room we were given was tiny and had a lousy view so we complained and hey presto we were given a nice big room on the 31st floor looking directly at the empire state we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and found the staff to be particularly helpful but our review would be far less positive if we had stayed in our original room;4
this is a big and very busy hotel there is always something going on weddings parties and business meetings when we were there the parking is expensive however we used public transport so the free transport from the metro station at the bottom of the hill was most welcome we went everywhere with our tap card so were exhausted when we got back to the station we did not use the park but had the occasional coffee and breakfast at the restaurants we had one buffet breakfast at the hotel not memorable and fairly expensive mixing sausage with the bacon meant the bacon frequently ran out had to join honours to get free wifi but you still have to pay one day to join it it worked well for my son but only two days on my device the rooms were spacious and clean we were;4
the jane hotel i was encouraged by the overall positive reviews about the jane on trip advisor and after a look at the janes beautifully designed and eccentric web site i decided to book three nights through lastminutecom for 99â£60 a night i knew from reading the negative reviews that space in the single cabin might be an issue so i wasnt surprised by small dimensions of the single cabin room what i was surprised about was how clever the design of the cabin is true there is only a single bed and definitely not enough room to swing a cat why would anyone swing a cat how cruel but the space beneath the first half of the bunk had a large holdall for a suitcase and the second half underneath the bunk had two large drawers on top of one another the other;4
our room was a decent size for the two of us and was cleaned every day we had some difficulties at check in so mohammed helped us out and gave us a free room upgrade it was in an excellent location which had penn station over the road and the local subway stops on each side of the building msg was across the road too and we were within walking distance of times square 30 rock and the empire state building the staff were so friendly and welcoming but by far the best thing about this hotel is the fact that tik tok diner is directly underneath we would 100 stay here again and look forward to;4
we stayed at the hotel for a week the location is wonderful internet was great housekeeping was fabulous the air condition may need an upgrade soon but overall i would recommend the hotel and will stay there again;4
nice hotel pretty well located with no need to pay for the breakfast considering the amount of shops around concierge is nice and has a lot of good plans a bit expensive though but this is new york;4
i donât know if itâs due to covid but this hotel has no concierge service other than that itâs an excellent hotel that is so close to the airport by the way the free shuttle transport driver was rude;4
we stayed for a week at the start of january at first we were given a room on the third floor the room entrance in a stairwell and presumably smoking because it reeked of marijuana outside the window was a bar so could not sleep as the window did nothing to keep out the noise or the chill we mentioned on the third day to reception about the cold as our heater done nothing to warm the room and staff were quick to bring us a space heater but also offered us a change in room we decided to swap rooms what a difference it was on the sixth floor and the room was nonsmoking had air conditioning and heating worked a charm flat screen tv as compared to the other rooms box which was older than the both of us who stayed i have to mention though that the wifi did not;4
the hotel is conveniently located just blocks from the port authority and penn station it also was centrally located to all of our destination sites 911 memorial rockefeller center and the united nations bulding the general appearance of the hotel is grande we were able to check in at noon we were pleasantly surprised to have a nice view of the empire state building and a distant view of the chrysler building there were 2 problems with our room the windows are very drafty even with the drapes closed also the bathroom paint was peeling on the walls and the tub glaze otherwise i would have rated 5 stars there are signs outside the elevators on a number of floors that apologize for the remodeling there was no remodeling being done during our midweek stay;4
gorgeous hotel lovely people shower design in bathroom is very poor and is a slip and fall risk people with mobility issues should not stay in this hotel until the shower design is changed do inquire as to the shower setup if you are in any way of limited mobility;4
this hotel is in a great location for visiting universal studios its about 10 minutes walk away staff were friendly the food at the sierra cafe was yum pool area was nice and they provided pool towels room was nice a good size bed was comfy bathroom was spacious only negative was the air conditioning unit didnt work properly which is isnt good on 100deg days but we only stayed there one full day so by the time we realised it wasnt working it was too late to get it fixed overall an enjoyable stay a tip for universal studios if you are planning to go on the rides and the tour buy the front of line pass so you can skip the queues wait time for some rides was 70 minutes;4
my husband and i stayed here on our honeymoon and had a great stay we stayed on the airport side and you couldnt hear a thing windows did great at keeping out the sound the room was great clean and spacious we never really got enough large towels there were only 2 large towels per room and if you showered after the maid came that day you were out of luck unless you called to request more the only other thing i had an issue with was they took way longer than they should have to prepare our room when we booked it months in advance check in time was at 3 we arrived in at 11 am which was no problem they said theyd text us when it was ready never got anything so around 3 we came back and it still wasnt ready it was after 4 before we were able to go up to our room;4
great hotel and location close to central park and upper west side shops and bars room rate included parking which was convenient typical small city size room but was comfortable would have liked to take advantage of the roof deck since it was such a nice thursday night but was told it was closed for a private party first floor bar was small but comfortable would definitely stay again;4
stayed here 7 nights back in 2014 we flew end of september lovely lobby area quick checkin however the first room given to us was way too small spoke to lady in front desk and they were more than happy relocate us to a bigger room the room bathroom was clean and provided basic amenities concierge were great organised private transfer back to airport and always hailed down a taxi for us when we were heading out for a night out perfectly located close to penn station madison square garden you could walk to time square and explore the city the hotel has a decent diner breakfast is decent tip although all the rooms had wifi we found that the lobby had the fastest internet in the hotel;4
i can understand why the location of this hotel would turn someone away but we loved our stay here we used it as a central location and caught the redline to la livestaples centre hollywood walk of fame and universal studios at night we did uber because its so cheap in la 12 to rainbow bar and grill normal smart traveler behaviour and you wont have an issue with getting from the hotel to the subway there isnt much around the hotel in regards to food uber again so cheap in la but there is a bottle shop and laundry mat close by breakfast is complementary and was the highlight of our stay omelettes and waffles made fresh while you wait and they are so tasty hugo you rule my omelettes man overall this hotel definitely has a lot to offer and should be worth;4
what a fabulous find thanks to trailfinders centrally located and value for money the hotel is quirky with great decor and lovely rooms the bathrooms are well stocked and have a great shower i could not fault the staff in any way ba lost all our luggage and they could not do enough to help us lending us adapters offering free wi fi and keeping us up to date with news the rooftop bar was my best highlight and only complaint it has the most incredible views and the perfect place to relax on after a day out in ny the fact it closes at 9pm is such a waste of the hotels best feature having said that i think 20 for a small beer and 2 cans of coke was scandalous and possibly would put people off staying up there id really suggest looking at this as the prime;4
with steep nyc hotel rates this is hotel is a steal we staying in a renovated room on the 13th floor which had a very modern if slightly disco decor the renovated bathroom was very clean and efficient this hotel is literally a few steps away from the subway making it is extremely convenient and quick to get anywhere in manhattan the residential neighborhood is friendly not too crowded with lots of restaurants in walking distance the staff was very pleasant and answered all our questions i will say that other floors we passed in the elevator did not appear to be renovated to the same level as ours my one complaint is that the hallway and the 13th floor in general was kept unbearably hot in december i expect the heat to be on but not a sauna we had to put the;4
after reading other reviews before going i thought i had made the wrong choice but i have to say what a great 5 nights we had beds really comfortable the maid kept our room spotless everyday very quiet at night the location is great to and the dinner downstairs tick tock had many a great breakfast there would definitely go back ðð;4
we stayed there for five nights we had an executive room on a higher floor overlooking the city walk the room was spacious clean and the view was amazing staff was friendly and helpful shuttle bus was very convenient drawbacks were 1 no free internet which all guests complained about but still the management wont listen instead they copy and paste some blah blah reply to peoples complaints 2 elevators are a nightmare we once had to wait for 15 minutes called the front desk and when the elevator finally arrived it kept stopping on each and every floor until it was crammed and we could hardly breathe a sorry excuse for an elevator 3 the bathroom could really use some renovation 4 parking fees are exceptionally high higher than the car rent itself;4
stayed here for 4 nights week before christmas last year this was our third time to new york but first time at this hotel the location is great we hardly got the subway to anywhere the only place we got the subway was when we went further afield to natural history museum or the oculus apart from that we walked everywhere staff were friendly and hotel was dated but clean we always had a good nights sleep even with all the noise outside i think we were on floor 23 but we still heard a lot of outside noise i would still recommend this hotel and would stay here again;4
there is no better place in all of manhattan to consider for a stay especially with the metropolitan opera right at your front door add to that perk fine dining steps away and shops and movie theaters which beckon you as well;4
would recommend this hotel purely for the location it is right near madison square garden basically opposite it me and my brother visited and had the room 1945 which included a view of the empire state building and it was incredible it is also near times square overall perfect location the hotel itself felt like an apartment no bb so you have to get up and leave to eat out which isnt that much of a problem you also have to show your key card as soon as you walk in before you get the lift to your floor the rooms were clean and me and my brother were pleasantly surprised we both had a double bed each the shower on the other hand wasnt the most comfortable the heating was fine but the bath itself that you stand in just wasnt comfortable the shampoo and conditioner;4
it was a great place to stay heading to universal studios with the family we were in a suite that was really lovely and luxurious everything was as expected from hiltons finest comfortably slept two adults in a king bed with kids in a pullout enjoyed watching some of the oscars at hotel bar and staff there were good breakfast also not so bad although didnt try the buffet my only real complaint about this hotel was that the hot tub was not hot at all it was about the same temperature as the pool and with the weather being a bit cool for this time of the season a nice warm tub would have been welcomed overall i would recommend this hotel but you have to be prepared to pay a premium;4
we have just had a wonderful time in this hotel we stopped for 4 nights in a deluxe king room the room was large clean and the bed was so comfortable the whole time we were there the staff could not have been more helpful the hotel is in a great location just off broadway and so easy walking distance to everything in central manhattan;4
property was okay and the front desk staff was very helpful cant remember the exact day of the week we stayed but it was about 150 plus tax we contemplated stay an additional night but the cost doubled to over 300 which was definitely not worth it lobby was neat however the elevators really small hallways and our room appeared not to have been updated in some time room temperature was an issue we were there during the cold snap in december 2017 and the hotel had the heat cranked up no means of control the heat so we actually had to run the air conditioner to make the room comfortable;4
we stayed here for two nights with our two teenagers while visiting universal studios and enjoyed our stay greatly we loved being able to easily walk to universal studios or take the free shuttle bus which runs every 20 minutes or so our room was quiet clean and comfortable we had a nice view of the universal studios entrance and city walk which was beautiful at night the double beds were soft and comfortable and bathroom had a nice shower head with varying settings we were a little surprised to find an older standard definition tv in the room but that didnt really matter to us the only minor confusion was how to self park as you need to register first to get your room key prior to entering the parking garage there are other hotels which are more centrally;4
the location is great as well as the lobby and bar area our room was dirty by saying that i mean that it looked clean but the carpet was very dirty by saying dirty i mean you step on it and your socks turn black also the rooms are in need of some serious updating and upgrading;4
we booked this hotel through lastminutetravelcom so until the confirmation we didnt know the name of the hotel it turned out to be astor on the park and although we were prepared to anything for the price 29 per night it was far far beyond our expectations convenient location it is 2 minutes walk from 103st subway station so it takes either 4 stations to times square or 10 15 minutes by taxi great bathroom it is literally bathroom not just shower this was quite critical as it was very very cold when we were in nyc so hot bath in the evening was essential room is very small but sufficient it was cleaned everyday friendly staff the only problem is that we had to turn on heating everytime we came back in the evening as they switch on during the;4
as you would expect if you are planning on visiting universal whilst in la then this is the place to stay big rooms and great service throughout our stay the pool is lovely if you want to chill out in the hot california sun you are also in walking distance from universal city walk for evening entertainment and of course get into the park an hour before everyone else why is it not excellent the costvery expensive but that will be down to the location;4
we stayed there on two separate occasions in august first time we were given a room upgrade which was a nice size the second time we stayed we got a standard room which was a little small the rooms had coffee machines and the usual accessories staff were polite and generally helpful the hotel has an art deco theme in the rooms we were told that rooms had recently been refurbished not sure i would have guessed without being toldac was load but very good the hotel is well located madison square gardens is across the road time square is not too far a walk and there is a subway station right next to the hotel which goes straight to jfk there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants locally and a hertz car rental round the corner though i have never been to a less;4
from the service to the decor everything was awesome the doormen had great advice on where to go and what to do around the city and everyone was prompt friendly and helpful the rooms are awesome and the whole vibe of the place has a cool feel to it get up to the rooftop bar for a drink in the evening and admire the awesome view;4
close to universal good service only bad thing was the gym was closed for the days i was there even though they made alternative choices it was still an inconvenience 5 min walk to universal walk lots of restaurants as usual city hotel parking will cost you;4
excellent location for everything can walk to pretty much everything from the hotel with madison square on your doorstop hotel clean and comfortable my only slight moan would be that when we booked the room we were told that there was a large queen bed but although i was staying with a very good friend the bed was a small double and we had to pay 25 a night to upgrade to a room with 2 bedsthe tick tock diner was brilliant the food was excellent and the staff were really friendly overall good value for miney;4
once i had booked the hotel i rang the hotel leading up to my stay i was unfamiliar with the location and wanted to get the best directions from lax i spoke to a really helpful guy who was working the front desk his name was michael i was calling from sydney australia and he assisted me with all my enquiries he was even nice enough to tell me what the weather was like in la he definitely made me fell good about booking my stay great service and really friendly stuff;4
well located hotel near columbus circle good facilities and friendly helpful staff only negatives room decor was a bit tired didnt detract from the trip though and no free wifi but lots of ny hotels are the same;4
the hotel was nice as well as the staff i ran out of diet coke and decided to spend the money for an overpriced one in the fridge in the room i opened it and took a drink and it didnt taste right so i checked the date on the bottom to find it had expired months previous not weeks but months after alerting the front desk and taking it down to them they said they would take it off the bill but they decided to still charge me for it i checked a friends room and the product in the fridge was only expired by only a couple months beware of these items they are overpriced and many times will expire due to the time they sit there;4
the location cant be beat right across the street from lincoln center great restaurants all around the price for a late winter break was pretty amazing as well starting at the entrance the guys who work the front door are great friendly helpful and always available the front desk staff were efficient and courteous checking in was a breeze and getting a replacement for a demagnetized key at 1 am took seconds the lobby bar was nice but table service was slow i was in a double room on the second floor 2 queen sized beds nicely decorated but some wear and tear on the furniture not much room between the bed and the desk getting in and out of the bathroom was a squeeze not wheelchair or walker friendly standard minibar keurig for coffee but i didnt;4
i recently stayed four nights for a work trip based on curiosity and some nice reviews i prefer the west village and this hotel is literally as far west as you can go in manhattan right on the westside highway but in inclement weather its not the closest to metro stops if cobbled streets and overall charm of the entire neighborhood is worth it for you as it is for me then at least stop by the jane for a drink at its bar or a bite at its cafe this is one of those hotels that spent a lot of money designing and decorating a brand new hotel with as old looking things as possible not to say that its filled with antiques but just furniture lighting and carpet that was expensive yet looks really worn and from a certain era all fitting in its theme the carpet in;4
obviously a little dated but but location is excellent was able to walk everywhere really enjoyed the history of the building room was very clean and as some other reviews have highlighted windows were a bit drafty but the heating was fine would certainly use this hotel again;4
this hotel is great for the family who wants to vacation at universal studios however i wouldnt really recommend it for the business traveler unless you are part of a convention being held on site there just isnt much of a night life in walking distance;4
just a little history this was known as the hotel bryant the rockettes used to live there as well as having other famous guests who stayed dean martin billie holiday tony bennett etc the good which far outweigh the not so good beds were comfy room was clean shower was great staff was excellent especially the front desk staff viktor k was so kind and helpful as was everyone else including the doormen i cant say enough about them to express how accommodating and helpful they were the parking garage was just across broadway and very convenient to the hotel only 12 block away discounted rates through the hotel are worth it so make sure to get the parking ticket stamped great location the not so good but overall fairly minor except for the ac i;4
stayed there for 5 days just because great location with small cold pool for the kid we decided to stay in a hotel because our first plan to stay in long island for a wk got cancelled there is always something to do in the city hotel was near lots of attractions a small mall and a great french bakery which i had breakfast a few times one day i think there was a party in the rooftop and a huge line outside of the hotel;4
we were visiting this hotel for a 3 night stay prior to going on a cruise its very central right opposite madison square garden and about a 10 minute walk to times square its a busy hotel and the check in line was huge at some times of the day however we were lucky and checked in pretty smoothly the lifts are also subject to you being there at the right time i was very pleased with our room and we had everything we needed we didnt eat at the tick tock diner in the hotel so cant comment on how good it was i would definitely stay here again;4
stayed here for my honeymoon july 2013lovely hotel friendly staff and location is excellent not far from madison square gardenswould highly recommend this hotel to any friends or family and what an amazing city new york is;4

i was hesitate about staying at a one star hotel but a friend had said it was fine we were very pleased with what we got for 90 for the two of us our room was clean and attractive with enough room for a double bed and a twin bed with good storage a closet and lots of drawers we appreciated the refrigerator in the room our bathroom was newly tiled and very clean and shiny the only negative thing i would say was the hall carpets were worn looking and unattractive the staff was always pleasant and helpful the neighborhood was quieta very residential apartment neighborhood there were lots of grocery stores and decent and inexpensive restaurants nearby for a little more exciting neighborhood columbia university was only about five blocks away we are a couple;4
my husband was at this hotel for a conference and i flew in for the weekend to enjoy some time at universal studios this hotel was the perfect location and just a short walk to the park it was great not having to deal with parking or driving up to universal studios our room was comfortablei wish my husband had requested a room on a higher floor so we could see the park we had a view of the freeway the staff was very nice from checkin to room service concierge valet everyone uber and lyft drivers had a hard time finding the hotel but other than that it was a great stay;4

we stayed at this hilton for 2 nights while visiting family in the area the location near the highway was very convenient especially given that you didnt hear any traffic noise on the property our room was a good size updated and clean the pool which is heated was lovely and well landscaped it was great to have access to a printer to take care of boarding passes and the little in house store was well stocked we will definitely stay here when in the area again;4
we stayed here whilst visiting universal studios the location was great and the buffet that they had on the weekend was just amazing the room wasnt large but fine as we hardly spent anytime in them we travelled with 2 children 12 and 8 who loved the hotel not the cheapest prices but good quality accommodation over all;4
i arrived at the hotel around 12am and the reception persons behavior was not so good my room was quite and clean overall but it was a pity that previous users soap was dropped in the bathroom and the electricity plugs was broken when i checked out the reception person and doormans attitude was good totally i would like to stay this hotel for the next time;4
this was my first trip to new york so this is my only nyc hotel experience the hotel is well located next to main subway lines that can be used to access the entire city beautiful lobby very helpful staff good security at elevators two restaurants on first floor elevators were fast and during 5 days only experienced one elevator too full to board i was on the 21st floor did not have a great view other rooms were probably much better beds were very comfortable not hard and the ac worked well during the heat of early september only amenities were a flat screen tv and a hair dryer not a lot of room for luggage as the double bed room was small no space for bath equipment in bathroom recommend hanging toiletries bag;4
i found the staff to over the top friendly and helpful the rooms are well appointed as well as the bathroom free shuttle to universal studios and citywalk the outside pool and hot tub area was really nice and had a large patio there is even a poolside bar my only complaint would be the slow internet service on my floor 20th and sometimes weak signal otherwise i very much enjoyed my stay here i had free wifi but not sure it was because i was a hilton honors member;4
i stayed at this hotel for one night to celebrate a friends birthday that was being held on the rooftop we had a fantastic time the room was clean and service was great the room was small which can propose a problem if you have a large suitcase the food i ordered from room service was delicious the rooftop was very nice as well i recommend empire hotel for a daycation or business trip like i said the rooms are small so pack light or pack a duffle bag;4

stayed here mid jan for three nights paid about â£310 for a room with two queens for three people room was fairly big and more than adequate for three peoplethree large suitcases bathroom was basic shower sink and toilet plenty of towels clean so what more do you want free wireless was great but at times was a bit slow but nothing unsurmountable and having a laundry room was helpful we were on third floor and near sauna room which unfortunately we had no time for to negate some myths we never had any issues with the temperature in the rooms and the location contrary to various negative comments is absolutely no issue we walked or used metro for three straight days and had no car never had any issue going to hollywood or universal metro contrary to various;4

for the price this is as good as it gets in ny city it is located on 106th st on central park west about a forty five minute walk into the hustle and bustle however there is a subway stop about two minutes along the road which costs 2 into town the fact that the hotel is right opposite central park is a bonus and a morning stroll around the park is a must for food and drink nearby the hotel columbus ave provides ample choice the walk into the centre is well advised you pass the natural history museum strawberry fields and a little restaurantebar called the tavern on the green a draw for tourists so a little expensive but well worth popping in for a drink and a look around the gardens now for the hotel check in was swift and friendly and the doormen are more than;4
if youre only in la for universal studios this hotel is an obvious choice its a couple of minutes walk away from both universal studios and city walk and there is a shuttle bus if you dont want to walk its also a 10 minute walk to a metro station which was really handy for accessing other parts of la the walk back from there is up hill but theres a shuttle that takes you from the bottom to the entrance to universal which is great if you dont want to walk the room i had was massive and while i could see the freeway from there the noise didnt bother me all the staff i met were helpful and friendly so no complaints there the amenities in the room were good and the bed and sofa were comfortable i cant comment on the food as i ate at city walk but the buffet;4
hi there just got back from nyc a few hours ago ive spent 7 nights in this upper west side inn i was a little worried about it when i saw other comments about the place also they never answer emails dont even bother and on the phone they are preatty rude for a group of four girls we too the groundfloor deluxe suite it was really not expenses 50 buck per person and per night what would you excpect for that price well we had a small appartment very well located and cleaned every day you enter a corridor and there is a huge bedroom on the left on the right a nice bathroom then you enter a room that is supposed to be a small living room with a sofa bed for two and a small kitchen the kitchen is really appreciated for breakfast cooking coffee et a;4
this hotel is about a minutes walk from universal studios and there is a free tram which you can use which stops at the hotel i was on the top floor and had a view of the themepark which was good the normal breakfast is ok it has fruit and toast and basic breakfast items then the other breakfast additionall charge has cooked food i normally never ever eat in hotels as i dont really like hotel restaurants but i actually gave this one ago and returned again which is extremelly rare for me;4

good location very clean great front desk staff no room service i had an early flight out of lax and stayed at the hyatt regency to make an easy transition to the airport guest rooms are clean and very comfortable as well as having good sound proofing front desk staff was warm and welcoming the only disappointment was that there is no room service the only option for food and beverage is to go down to the lobby and order from a very limited menu;4

this is my third time in this hotel no doubt that every time gets better than the other we receive an upgrade to a small suite the room is nice two bedrooms cafe mashing the bathroom is very small and the shower is made new the personnel is great always trying to help the only thing is very uncomfortable to show the room card each time you have to accede the elevators;4
we chose this hilton due to location near the universal studios big hotel with very nice views from room over backside from belair hills mulholland drive unfortunately and this is only minus runs a 4 hines highway aside the hotel and as the windows are thin one hears the traffic noice thoughout the night it is therefore recommended to ask for rooms to another side room was large but as many hilton hotels a bit outdated bathroom showers also had not 4 standard pool looks nice although we didnt use it people will chose this hotel mainly for shortness to universal studios and therefore its perfect;4
i stay here quite regularly for business being so close to penn station is extremely convenient while the rooms are small they are clean and the staff is friendly as can be especially onelia at the front desk not sure if that is the correct spelling they are very accommodating for early checkin needs and show genuine concern for comfort of the guests;4
a friends son had an audition for julliard and this was the closest most reasonably priced hotel my friend booked the rooms and when i read the reviews i had many concerns they turned out to be unfounded my room was clean and well appointed there were a few design errors that made the bathroom sink faucet a bit inefficient for that sink design but other than that everything was fine i have stayed in many motels and hotels and have had mixed experiences at very high end hotels and good ones at average motels the room showed some signs of guest wear and tear there was a repaired gash in my door but hotels cant always control that some people dont feel they have to respect a hotel room as they respect their own homes the staff was marvelous sophy and jamole;4
great service value and location although the furnishings are a bit age worn they are clean and comfortable and hip ny deco swank we loved it we celebrated our 10th anniversary here and they sent us up a bottle of champagne how cool is that also loved the restaurant pool rooftop central park a jewel we will definitely come back;4
stayed there for two nights since it was convenient to universal universal provides a free shuttle that comes by regularly to drop you off at citywalkuniversal studios unfortunately the ride back makes an extra stop at the sheraton first but definitely worth using on the ride to the park saves some walking for the big day at the park continental breakfast buffet was better than average hotel elevators were extremely slow only three working elevators for a hotel with over twenty floors the room was spacious and quiet i noticed theyve disabled the elevator chime when it arrives at your floor a nice touch since we had a room near the elevator and hearing that is always annoying desk staff was courteous and professional free apples at the desk which was nice;4
the room could of been a little bit cleaner but other than that the stay was very satisfying the food at the hotel restaurant was great as well as the drinks from the lobby bar the staff was very efficient making check in and out quick and painless;4

i admit i was worried after reading all the negative reviews on tripadvisor so heres my report after staying there its perfectly fine a safe convenient location there are many restaurants and a starbucks within the block theres a 24hour pharmacy next door the staff is friendly and helpful our group checkin was well handled the building is older and undergoing external renovation there is scaffolding in front the lobby is nice and comfortable two elevators are in service two are out of service the wait for an elevator was never very long the stairs are safe and convenient my room was older but the bathroom was updated and new the free internet worked both in the lobby and in my room its a days inn not the ritz its an older building not a roadside;4

i stayed in the 20th floor and had a great view of the park and the city staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs although i did not like how the park shuttle during the morning was a free for all it was very unorganized;4
the hotel represents a good value less than 150night in a town where paying less than 200night seems hard to do the room was on the small side but clean the bed was comfortable and the breakfast included was good with waffles and omelets made to order however my room was directly and it was loud outside there are several hospitals nearby and sirens were common there are some good places to eat within walking distance and an la rail station is very close;4
when visiting universal studios this is the right place to stay the hotel is the usual good hilton standard the seafood buffet in the restaurant is five star with crab legs oysters sushi sashimi lobster carvery and crepe stations etc it is clean modern and a bit boring to look at but the location is a blast our room was on a low floor actually under lobby level and handicap friendly we had the view of the hotels outdoor pool but the high rooms have probably got more interesting views parking was not too expensive for los angeles and the staff was helpful tickets to the universal studios are sold at the hotel and from there it is a five minute walk to get to the park i do not like when wifi is not included you dont pay extra for aircondition or tap water do;4
i stayed one night on business and the location was crazy convenient the hotel is very near many transportation options the staff was helpful my room seemed like it had just been remodeled snappy and clean but wowthe room was tiny i mean really small i was alone so that was ok but it would have been unpleasant for two people if youre traveling alone for a night this is a good choice but if you want a romantic weekend dont get one of the hotels minirooms;4

we stayed one week in this hotel and for this price in manhattan it was really great room was a little old bed was ok not the newest one but everything clean fresh sheets new towels every day bin cleaned we had flat tv and frigde although no privat bathroom there were 2 on the floor about 45 rooms and we had no problems in the moring 3 people bathroom gets little dirty and full of water after a while lokation was excellent 3 minutes to the subway then like 15 to times square little grocery markets around the corner we had a decent stay if you dont want to spent lot of time in the hotel a relly cheap way to go to mahattan would recomend for anyone that doesnt need much luxury;4
the morningside inn is situated in a great part of the upper west side for travelers it is only 3 blocks north or south of the subway entrance being 110th on broadway or 103rd on broadway which puts you on the red line we had room 106 which is on the bottom floor as it was close to the elevator a few times it was a bit noisy but no real problem the room was neat tidy with two double beds fridge rc ac shower in the bathflat screen tv ceiling fan hand basin bar heater small items of repair that the room needs are tiles coming up in floor of bathroom security chain on the door needs to be replaced door lock latch on entrance door to the room need to be replaced as while they where function able the door did not close entirely there is a communal kitchen;4
friendly staff funky decor and good location room was very hot for some reason more than just outside temp but with air con on it cooled down cold tap in our bathroom wasnt working and only given a temporary fix to allow hot water only when we made reception aware of it otherwise a fantastic place in a great location very cool building inside with great heritage despite feeling clean and modern friendly service given by staff on desk opening doors and cleaners;4
i stayed here a couple of weeks ago knowing that it was a dated hotel in a notsoglamorous part of town iâve stayed in many hotels in nyc from the ritz carlton to hampton inn i found this hotel to be quite desirable for my needs first of all it was close to penn station and i always go to nyc from baltimore by train also when i did use uber my rides were not that expensive my room was small but iâm alone and donât need a large room i have a lovely apt in baltimore to come home to so this room was clean and the service was great iâd highy recommend this reasonably priced hotel;4
the hotel is literally across the airport i can see the planes from the room the rooms are nicely designed modern and theres a hint of minimalism in the design the hallways are nice as well i understand the hotel was just recently renovated so it looks new looking out the the window thats where youll see signs of the old hotel the side of the hotel room we stayed in has the view of the colourchanging pillars it s nice the lobby is quite spacious and again modern nice to hang out theres a restaurant i liked the fried pork belly dish theres also a nice convenience type store where you could buy food drinks snacks etc open 247 try the ramen only a minor problem is the parking theres limited parking beside you have to park in the building beside 16;4

its always easy at this hyatt if your flying in or out of lax they have the best transportation of any hotel in lax i have tried them all i also like that i can walk over to the hotel after sitting on the jet from london to la walking from the intl terminal is very enjoyable not that la has great air but its nice to be outside cairo is the club lounge manager is one of the best yes i like the club floor at the marriott better my kids love watching jets but cairo makes the hyatt club fun if the marriott were to hire him away huston we have a problem so you want to make it easy and enjoy a wonderful club the hyatt is your hotel i have spent 25 or more nights in this hotel over the past two years;4
hotel in excellent location service was great however the hotel is old and is showing its age i had the double suite and it was smaller than the pictures online show i enjoyed my stay at wyndham overall but next time i might choose a newer hotel with more room;4
we stayed here for my husbands 30th and it didnt disappoint the location was so central and being next to penn station was great definitely take advantage of being so close to the subwayif only to save your feet 510 minutes walk to the empire state building and times square a perfect base to explore we were given early check in and after an initial mix up and a room change we happily settled into a corner room on the 35th floor with an amazing view the room we stayed in looked like it had been recently refurbished it was clean with a very comfortable bed and great shower the room may have been classed as a bit on the small side but as a couple we were happy and who spends time in their hotel room in new york the room had a safe iron and board tv and hairdryer as;4
arrived from australia 4 hours before checkin time and that was no problem the staff at the front desk were really nice throughout my 4 night stay i had ants in my room which i discovered at 1030 at night the lady at the front desk organized for someone to come sort it out straight away which was good they also happily changed my notes for coins to use the washing machine and dryer the bed was super comfy and big there is not a great deal of things in the area but the bus and red line are close by which you can take to hollywood universal studios or to the beach i would definitely stay there again if i was traveling with others but its probably not the most convenient place when youre getting around on your own;4
we love the locationeasy walk to central park columbus circle lincoln center across the street lovely views available ask we took the deluxe kingthe standard room is too small for us excellent service outstanding reasonably priced breakfast at the hotel restaurant high ceilings and windows in our room and the restaurant gave lots of light best sleep in townfine beds and beautiful sheets;4
we booked here because this was our final destination of our route 66 trip and its claims to be on route 66 with a few 66 themes the hotel is lovely but i still feel a little over priced the area it is situated in has an extremely high amount of homeless people on the street so going out on the evening was a little concerning we stayed for 3 nights and was happy with our room the pool area was nice to but quite small and a little dated with bad taste of 80s music playing the bar staff were great and we stayed one evening for the comedy which was pretty cool to but some comedians were too political and that isnt comedy for me overall the hotel is nice but just in the wrong area;4
ive stayed here multiple times and will do so again the only problem i encountered was the housekeeping staff missed my room one day the staff is very friendly and eager to help i would definitely book this again on a return visit;4

arrived for 3nts sat to tues of the queens funeral weekend and was allocated a room on 2nd floorthe bed was the most rickety bed i have ever had to sleep in it was falling apart and that was just the starti had called to ask about work taking place and was told no work at the weekend well that was untruedue to a lot of dust and it was a lot just like a smoke bomb was in the corridor we changed our room to one on a higher floor away from the noise and dustthe lady that dealt with our complaint at first was not very approachable unfortunately i didnt take her name but when we asked to change room she was very moody and stormed off to the officecame back and said we would have to come back after 3pm this was not acceptable to us as it was only 10am and had no plans;4

just writing this whilst waiting to fly home from newark airport we stayed at the ameritania after a recommendation from our travel agent and reading ta reviews the hotel sits nicely in between central park and times square so we found it to be quite nicely placed we had room 417 which was quiet as far as the noise of nyc although there was a constant hum from the air conditioning unit outside ear plugs worked a treat and our view was shocking a wall the room although dated was clean and had all we needed a comfortable bed a decent shower clean towels safe iron and ironing board even an umbrella to use it could have done with some more storage for your clothes there was no breakfast at the hotel which suited us as we wanted to eat out there was complimentary tea;4
i have stayed at this hotel for a number of years attending the same annual event in nyc the tick tock diner has expanded during the last couple of years and is always busy reasonable and open 24 hours for that quick eating experience we did notice one long time waiter had completely lost his cool on monday morning which was unfortunate also the oatmeal on tuesday morning was like water hopefully they will get their quality back in their service otherwise it was fine and convenient the room we had was smaller than in the past but was adequate one we were able to obtain a second suitcase rack otherwise the hotel continues to be efficient clean and welcoming i found the exercise room to be in good repair as was the business center security was ever present;4
great first stay at the empire hotel a lovely welcome from charming pasqaule who offered us free wifi access for the duration of our stay this was very appreciated as we were able to call our 2 little boys in st maarten each morning and evening we also had a lovely surprise of 2 complimentary glasses of champagne courtesy of michael the receptionist at our dinner which he booked for us at boulud sud thank you both the hotel has a hip bar and lounge which brings some interesting characters and long lines waiting to access it through an elevator in the front lobby area the lobby and lobby bar are tastefully decorated as are the rooms the only qualm i have is our room was very small imo not having stayed at hotels in big cities before i cant say whether a small room;4

we stayed at the ameritania for 4 nights arrived very late on a sunday night and were checked in quickly arrived to our room on the 12th top floor room was very small we did only choose the standard iâd read on previous reviews that the rooms were small but didnât expect it to be that small there was no desk just a trunk kinda thing to fit one small suitcase on probably didnât help that the mirror took up a large amount of space in the room it was huge bathroom was lovely clean and the shower was fantastic obviously itâs a given that new york is a noisy city and you could hear a lot of the noise in the room so i would suggest if you are a light sleeper like me to use earplugs we actually changed our room for the last night as we were getting married on the last;4
this hotel impressed me as soon as i got to the room and the breakfast breakfast the breakfast here is very good i love that you can get a specially made eggomelette designed by your desires hugo made most of my delicious breakfasts and mmmm where they good also i could fill up with some spinach and fruits which is exactly what a european like me likes area the area the hotel is in is okay unfortunately we see the lack of stable work good economy and healthy living in some of the areas nearby however this hotel is awesome service and room i found the attitude of service to be quite alright and the rooms to be absolutely excellent i love that you have a refrigerator in the room the cleaning done is top notch theres a very experienced lady;4
we were here for three days and two nights for a quick birthday trip all in all its a perfectly fine place to stay if youre not looking for luxury and plan to spend most of your time out of the room the good the staff was very kind and helpful they let us store our luggage for a few hours between checkout and when we had to leave for the airport we arrived a few hours before checkin and our room was already prepared we had a room overlooking the park and you cannot beat the proximity to the park itself no bed bugs the room showed some signs of wear and tear but the bed was overall clean enough nothing to do with the hotel but we met a couple of very sweet ladies from ireland who were leaving as we were checking in and they gave us their weeklong metro cards;4
we filmed both a profile interview and a celebrity photo shoot here in late january the rooms and hallways offered the perfect canvas for a palette of color character heritage and filtered afternoon winter light the hotel service is excellent and the on site downstairs restaurant offers a quiet escape and excellent house vegetarian and goats cheese salad highly recommended;4
the new yorker is central to new york a short walk up to broadway maceys for abit of shopping or empire state building central to everything in new york we did the hop on hop off tour a easy walk to where you catch the bus there is a little museum downstairs at the hotel where you get the history of the hotel and pictures of well known people from the past who ave stayed rooms are clean and great to stay in close to food outlets and the station;4
i got to the hotel early 11am so i could spend the day out with my friend in manhattan i didnt get any sleep on my long flight with a layover in atlanta so i was actually falling asleep in the lobby waiting for my friend to come meet me the front desk staff was very nice in offering early checkins for me and another couple that were waiting for checkin time 3pm i gladly took what was available so i could get a much needed nap before exploring the city the elevator was busy with housekeeping using the 1 elevator but i still didnt wait too long for it to be available for me to use the housekeepers were friendly while i passed them by to get to my room one of them even helped to make sure that my room was ready before i walked ion the room and bringing an extra;4
location is definitely the selling point of this hotel close to times square central park and empire state when we arrived we were told we had been upgraded and was in room 214 which had a bigger bed and bathroom to be honest i think a room on a higher floor would have been nicer as we had the street noise and a view of a wall the bathroom had tape all over the window the mirror was cracked at the bottom and the shower fitting was broken the bed was really comfortable though and the shower powerful and the hotel was just a base really so had all we needed the staff were always friendly and helpful the lady at the bar made really good french martinis so there was a nice atmosphere in the hotel i would go back as it was a good base in a good location;4
i arrived at 8am on a monday morning and the person working reception managed to find me a room so that i could shower and put a suit on for business meetings the room itself was unremarkable if a little unimpressive it was a very small room so much so that the maintenance man that came to fix the safe could barely fit in it at the same time as me the full length mirror was not attached to the wall and covered one of the electrical sockets the room itself however was in very good order modern and recently redone the ensuite shower room in excellent order too the view from the room was of the courtyard overlooking the other side of the hotel however as i stayed here it all made more sense i barely spent any time in the room as i was working and the early check in was;4
hotel was great we enjoyed the historical exhibit that celebrated the hotels 90th anniversary the only problem we had was the incredibly loud noise coming from a construction project on the corner of 34th st and 8th ave although we were on an upper floor we could still hear the sounds of cutting and drilling the city shouldnt allow these construction projects to go on so late at night;4
finding somewhere reasonably priced to stay in manhattan that isnt depressing is very difficult but the jane provides a solution located in the west village it is close to the bars of christopher st adjacent to the hudson river and the area is completely nonthreatening the rooms really are tiny but they are wellfitted out and the shared bathrooms are plush and far less of an inconvenience than you might imagine there is a stylish caferestaurantbar and they provide cool bikes to hire free of charge the only downsides are the presence of a nightclub in the basement which is open well into the early hours though only an issue if your room is low down in the hotel and the tiny rooms but they shouldnt put you off what is actually quite a plush and stylish hotel;4
nice weekend stay the staff was great at checkin helping with bags and giving us a great room that was quiet the hotel has great history and at every turn there is something unique and funky about it the captains cabin is all you need small but nicely appointed fun decor good value clean i think the only thing we did not like was the smell when we entered the room a perfumy cleaner but we just opened the window and aired it out the resturant adjacent was not impressive reviewed separately we stopped in early for drinks at the ballroom bar maybe 89 pm on a friday easy to order a drink dark and comfy a group was super obnoxious and loud vulgar but it did not spoil it for us they were actually good entertainment we checked out the ballroom and it was not crazy;4
room condition tired but bed super comfortable i took a mid level no view room and had very quiet nights sleep staff could not have been more pleasant they have to try harder since the owner isnt keeping up;4
hey having a great time in the hotel great rooms great views even extended my stay staff are doing a great job helping the front line staff close to everything i can even see the empire state building from my room;4
the hotel is well appointed rooms are very clean and comfortable and it offers lots of amenities for visitors its location is right across from universal studios so if you are planning on visiting there this hotel is very convenient the hotel offers a convenient shuttle to and from universal studios and city walk parking indoors was good but more often than not the room key to access the parking facility would not work just take a ticket and continue on it is added to your bill anyway we had dinner the first night in cafe sierra and it was ok nothing special we decided to try the lounge bar another night and it was bettersame kitchen i presume but better we also tried the sunday jazzchampagne brunch which was very good lots of choices sparkling wine;4
i too am a reviewer who is puzzled at the bad reviews that this place has received the hotel was more than just adequate for us and unless they have done major renovations and fix ups just before we arrived i would say the others are just super picky the location is great for catching a red line subway which when youre in la you probably would want to do to visit hollywood walk of fame etc dont bother walking if you have to go more than a few blocks as the walks are very boring and shady characters are always seemingly lurking its not like manhattan where you walk 20 blocks and dont even realise because there are things to see on the way anyway the whole hotel and room was very clean and well appointed with tv fridge and microwave included everything was fully;4
i recently stayed here for a weekend back in june i have to say i was blown away great attentive front desk staff and a really nice room the real hilight for me was the pool deck the dj up there had a really great mix kept me and my friend dancing all night the manager up there i think joe or joey was his name was one of the nicest friendliest guys ive ever met and ive stayed at a lot of hotels he kept coming around asking if we needed anything making sure we were satisfied he also felt really genuinea lot of times you get those managers who come across as fake and just trying to get a good tip or something but he was so sincere and so pleasant if i wasnt staying at the hotel id go back just to chat with him again great time over all;4
i have read so many reviews about this hotel the elevators take forever this and that i must say that i have worked for several hotels in my life which gave me knowledge about the business and its backstage sothis is not a 5 star hotel that said it is in the best location to me an opera lover who goes to nyc specifically for that and also some wondering around stop at tiffanys and little shopping oh women the front desk personnel is usually not friendly but the rooms are usually bigger than nyc hotels and again the location is almost unbeatable price is fair the bathroom is sort of small but hey again you cannot have it all to have it all you must pay a lot more so it is clean and i have had neighbors that were met singers so it was;4
for the price and location this was a great choice we were close to subway lots of restaurants central park and hudson river what more could we ask for;4
despite the crazy prices to park this is still the best place to stay only if you are going to universal studios the park shuttle no charge comes every 15 minutes or so and its a breeze to get to the park i guess in theory you are saving the 25 to park at universal studio so its a push but still is there really a need to inflate the parking charge that much well the corner room and bed were great and we had a nice view of the hills and the la traffic otherwise the lobby bar has half price appetizers at happy hour and no other issues for our quick 2 night getaway;4
the hotel is well located on the corner of broadway and west 54th i stayed here for a holiday for 10 days and had exceptional service and support from the staff and in particular julian the door man a mere 10 minutes from the heart of broadways theatre district moma central park columbus circle and easy access to the subway makes this hotel great for work or pleasure easy access to restaurants along broadway and down eighth avenue the room i had was big enough for one for an extended stay with a spacious bathroom and all the amenities i had a couple of minor room dramas my doing for which service were really helpful in responding to to top it off the lobby bar makes the best dirty martinis;4
wonderful location polite and helpful staff and nice rooms although ask for an external room when booking to avoid views of air conditioning units and the noise that goes with these;4
stayed at the new yorker in march just as carona virus was about to hit possibly not the best time to visit new york but didnt queue to visit anything which was great the new yorker hotel was very clean and the location couldnt have been better just up the way from the empire state building and central for all the sites we wanted to visit we were on the 34th floor of the hotel the room was very clean but also small but ideal for a long weekend which we were doing for my wifes birthday with friends the staff were all friendly and gave us the best routes to take we had planned to walk to the statue of liberty which we did the first full dayabout 6 miles each way walking along the hudson river to keep away from crouds and took in the sights along the way second full;4
you are working on getting rooms in better shape this trip was a great improvement from other visits i am a frequent guest at the empire hotel the location is great for going to the metropolitan opera the restaurant has good choices and high quality;4
i would definitely recommend this hotel as an economic and nice hotel to use as a base for exploring new york reception staff very friendly and informative canât recall the gentlemans name who welcomed us on arrival on tuesday 10th but thanks for your warm welcome bellmen very friendly wishing us a great day on our way out each day jeff is one particular name i recall being very friendly and helpful our room was very clean contrary to what we expected from the hotel literature we did have wifi in the room the room also had a safe which is always a welcome addition the hotel is very handy for 7th avenue subway station from there you can take the e line all the way to the jfk air link at a cost of 275 usd for the subway free if you have an unlimited use metro card and;4
i was upgraded to a king after reserving a standard room although ny is noisy from the 2nd floor i had a huge room by nyc hotel standards so i enjoyed the stay the location was convenient for my work but also to local shopping and easy to get up to museums;4
good hotel good location far enough away from the hustle and bustle of time square but close enough you can walk around 1015 min to time square and very close to central park very nice roof top pool and bar;4
very nice hotel in good location so nice with the roof top bar and pool we love this hotel and have visited it 3 times in past five years its near central park and subway lincoln center the hotel is perfect for a visit in new york it gives a feeling of luxury;4
this is a nice hotel in a great location comfortable and clean rooms helpful staff i wouldnt say anything about it is outstanding other than the location across the street from lincoln center a few blocks from times square and central park;4
my partner and i are loyal hh members and stayed at this hotel for three nights while on vacation in la the location is absolutely perfect as it is in walking distance to universal studios which features rides restaurants and a movie theatre it is also a short drive from many attractions in hollywood we were pleasantly surprised at how large our room was and impressed by the comfortable bed and amenities which included a fridge the hotel also offers parking at a price and it is conveniently located in the garage level of the hotel the only negative aspect of our experience was that we returned to our room after being gone all day to find that it hadnt been made up we left relatively early in the morning and didnt return until late in the evening and were quite;4
booked this hotel online clean and well maintained bedrooms our room had a fridge microwave tea and coffee facilities flat screen tv the reception staff were very helpful the room we were given was overlooking the courtyard only down side was the shared balcony which meant that you could leave your windows open at night when you were sleeping the rooms were small compared to other usa hotels i have stayed in but it was suitable for the two of us internet and a computer in reception provided for residents free of charge was quite impressed with this the only down side was the breakfast either they should do better or as in other hotels in the us forget about it and let the residents get it else where the first morning we went there was a miserable looking;4
i booked this hotel through trailfinders in january of this year for my daughter and i you can imagine our disappointmant on arrival at 11pm to be told that they did not have a room of the type we had requested we were offered either a smoking room neither of us smokes or a small room until next day when we would be moved into a larger room as we were both very tired we decided to take the small room and accepted vouchers for a free breakfast next day the room was small aand to use the ensuite was a challenge had we been slightly overweight we would never have managed to use it we were moved next afternoon to a larger room and were very comfortable in it for the rest of our stay as a previous reviewer stated there is not much room for hanging clothes of many;4
busy streets a lot of landmarks very close staffdoormen helpful overall great stay few minor things that i didnât get ie coffee was downstairs none in room bar was closed one night no explanation;4
we stayed here on march 2829 and had a fabulous time the hotel is literally steps away from universal studios and city walk our room was a double and was quite spacious on the 5th floor the room was able to accommodate 7 i know over capacity but i could only get one room at the rate i had with the use of inflatable mattresses the room was clean and quite the only improvement i could have asked for was a better view we could see the top of the building but still had a bit of a view i would highly recommend this hotel for those planning a few days at the park;4
hubby booked a last minute trip to ny we were offered the new yorker when we arrived the gave us an upgrade when hubby asked if we were in the referbed part we were on the 50th floor the room was small but nicely done out it was only to sleep in and store shopping bought beds were very comfy and clean towels were there every day the hotel is perfect for madison square garden diagonally opposite empire state building is a few blocks up macys is just next block up and times square is near and the high line walkway just behind the hotel tick tick diner adjoined to hotel is a fab place to eat too;4
we liked this place clean friendly staff free breakfast only thing we werent thrilled about was that you pay 24 per night for parking that wasnt a deal breaker but it was hidden in fine print and would have been nice to know ahead of time there was a staff member named ali who really stood out though he went above and beyond for us a couple times during our stay;4
we stayed for a wk end very clean rooms were small but what we expected our room had coffee maker within walking distance to time square close to penn station and subway new yorkers very helpful in giving directions on subway we were told on check in extra fee would be waved since we are wyndham vacation owners it was not extra 9000 was charged i have recommended and would stay there again;4
great location if you land at newark you can catch a train to penn station which is very close to the hotel the location was great ten mins walk from times square close to subway the lobby is lovely but the rooms are a bit tired as are the landings bring your own conditioner as that provided is in tiny bottles and not up to the job the staff were all lovely we had a couple of breakfasts in tick tock the onsite diner which was ok but there are better places elsewhere to have breakfast we had dinner twice in the onsite italian restaurant which was fab huge salads and excellent staff lobby staff very diligent in checking everyone had room key before accessing lifts which made us feel safe in short not luxurious but a safe clean hotel in a great location;4
if you are going to the met for an opera experience then the empire makes a great base staggering out of that heavenly plush auditorium after a wonderful performance but 4 12 hours long of handels giulio cesare once on the lincoln center plaza the friendly red illuminated neon sign empire means that you are only 5 minutes away from your bed no hassle for taxis or other means of transport our twin queen bedded room was very comfortable the shower room a bit tired but functional the heatingcooling system a bit noisy but it worked reception is very efficient and helpful leaving late on a monday we were allowed a 2pm checkout rather than the usual 1200 noon the inhouse chowder house restaurant provided a good value fish dinner no tea or coffee options;4
this was my second stay at the new yorker its midtown location is convenient to the rest of the city many subway lines are within a short walk from the hotel if you travel by train the hotel is two quick blocks from penn station;4
perfect hotel to visit new york the ocation is great staff very helpful the carpet in the room could be changed because it is not very clean but the rest is perfect for a nice stay relation pricequality very good;4
when we are trying to find a place to stay in nyc we always try to stay at the empire hotel it is in the perfect location on the southwest corner of central park so close to columbus circle and across the street from lincoln center the rooms are small especially if you have two queen beds one might not think that the empire hotel is a family type hotel but weve stayed their twice with a one year old and they were very accommodating since the rooms are a bit small setting up a packnplay or portable crib can prove to be a bit of a challenge the rooms we were in did not have a tub either the beds are comfortable and the room and hotel decor are very modern if there was one complaint it is the window ac units but i guess that is standard in most hotels if you;4
really nice hotel walking distance to universal park checkin was a little long lot of people checking in at the same time this is a very big hotel and laid out nicely self parking onsite is 30 a day reasonable for the area room was quite large with two queen beds and a nice view of the 101 freeway and mountains bed was comfortable as were the linens bathroom was good size shower head had low flow and needed to be replaced all in all a very good stay;4
good price but beware hidden charges 4 night stay incites a further 129 in facility fees then you have to pay 5 dollars for your luggage to be looked afterso whatâs the facility fee for exactly room are small but clean the saving grace for me was john at the concierge desk an absolute diamond couldnât do enough for mehere in the city alone for work so kind and helpful good location right by msg penn station so the whole of new york is very accessible must visits tavola italian on 9th carraghers bar for all you sports fans enjoy nyc it really doesnât sleep;4
the hotel is goodnothing negative to say unfortunately i can not tell you if it is better than any other hotel in nyc as we only stayed in this one definitely nicely locatednear times squarebut not in the center of the crowd room quiet smallbut really clean bathroom good and clean you might have breakfast at the hotel for 18personbut we didnt try itcause we were not that much into american breakfast stuff of the hotel really friendly and helpfulojust in case u plan to spent a bit time at your room ours was really small and not that nice to spent time inobit definitely nothing bad to say about the hotel bed was a bit softbut we didnt get any back painso still goodo;4
the hilton was a great location to enjoy universal studios unfortunately for all the hotel had to offer one cant appreciate its accommodations because you are hardly in the hotel after spending ten hours at the parks i thought paying to park in the hotel garage should be included in the high price to stay there the breakfast offer was nice but you need to pay for a substantial upgrade the staff throughout the hotel was friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and spacious;4
very close to the metro link but its in a neighborhood that we didnt venture out into at night nice pool area nice breakfast but after a week theres only so many ways to cook an egg 2 girls on reception were lovely and bubbly very easy to talk to although the courtyard has been refurbished the rooms are in need of a refurb and hopefully you wont get a room near the noisy vending machines;4
we had a beautiful room with a great view the room was a great size for nyc rooms the staff was extremely friendly beds were comfortable the location was perfect cvs and walgreens right there so we could get drinks and snacks we ate at both the tick tock diner and the butcher banker highly recommend this steakhouse the only negative and we didnt come here to do this was the tv channels were fuzzy i would stay here again;4
my daughter and i stayed here for 3 nights whilst making a weekend break to new york we didnt really use many of the facilities because the idea of our trip to was see new york city however the room was great 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms the staff were all so friendly and helpful i would definitely stay here again;4
theres a huge clustering of hotels in nyc in times square while thats inarguably an exciting place to be its also maddeningly mobbed noisy all night and overwhelmingly touristy the empire is only about 10 minutes walk north of times square but its upper west side location is worlds away one long crosstown block to central park across the street from lincoln center a few blocks from the whole foods on columbus circle the apple store at 66th broadway the subway cluster at columbus circle 59th street isnt as extensive as the times square cluster but it will get you most places you want to go best of all though this is a neighborhood there are plenty of visitors in the streets of course but most of the skyscrapers are full of residents people who;4
very friendly service hilton universal city buffet was also very good and clean room;4
me and my partner had chosen to stay in the new yorker based on a recommendation from her grandmother the price was very reasonable for a stay in central manhattan and the room surpassed my expectations there only issue we had was with the shower the temperature was hard to control either being too hot or too cold the hotel itself was nicely placed across the road from penn station and madison square garden as well as only being down the road from the empire state building if i were to ever visit new york again i wouldnt hesitate to stay in the new yorker;4
i stayed at the empire for around ten days recently the location is fantastic literally across the street from lincoln center the staff starting with the bellman the concierge the front desk to the housekeeping were all very friendly and willing to offer their services which is not very common in nyc overall my stay was very pleasant and will definitely return to the empire whenever am in new york again if the rates are not too high;4
this is truly a 35 star hotel down to the spec the location of the hotel is just amazing its got some great staff but in the end its not a 4 or 5 star experience lets start with breaking down all the good location this place is literally a few minutes between multiple stations with the closest being 2 minute walk it is literally around the corner from the late night show with stephen colbert note worthy food close by include 10min walk halal guys original soupman seinfeld mclarens bar himym and a great stall outside for lamb gyros 247 convenience stores finally it is a 10 minute walk to the heart of times square the hotel is dated but clean its staff are really nice and were always eager to help shout out to jeffery the door man got me and the wife to;4
took advantage of the king room and universal studios tickets for 2 deal which saved about 70 for the one night we stayed checked in late after a long flightthe lounge was still serving friendly waiter an aspiring actor surprise we had a decent pizza hotel prices of course but we didnt feel gouged mentioning that it was our anniversary it was in the comments box on the booking site scored us a room on an upper floor with a nice view very attentive front desk staff and concierge attractive lobby and garden there are restaurants and a movie theater by universal about a 10 minute walk away but theres nothing but universal studios and other hotels nearby this is a needacar hotel if youre doing any sightseeing coffee and snack kiosk in the lobby where;4
when i found out through priceline that we were staying at this hotel the first thing i did was come onto this site and start reading which is pretty much how all my vacations start of course after several reviews stating this hotel was terrible and so on i was so reluctant to stay that i tried to cancell our reservations on many occasions of course to no avail to my relief when we got there and checked in we were all fine yes the neighborhood could be improved upon well i didnt like walking at night but we were fine nothing happend the hotel is being refurbished as we speak there doing alot of work to it and its looking really nice the lobby has some couches and a little internet service nook and is tastefully decorated check in went smoothly but i can see how;4
an inviting and airy facility with friendly staff nd convenient offerings onsite of a bar a coffee and convenience food snack bar and a fine quality restaurant cozy general areas on each floor that seem perfect for relaxing outside your room with otherswas disappointed that there was no way to heat water for tea other than the coffee maker residual coffee flavor every time with only one teabag provided with caffeineneed herbal and both mugs were dirty called front desk who promised them sent right upnever arrivedwas graciously given a voucher for my inconvenience at checkout also the shower door kept sliding open so that made for a very wet bathroom aside from those glitches my stay was fine and i would still not discourage staying here for the fact that it;4
due to a busy conference schedule we had room service for most of our meals the service was very good and the food was excellent our room had a beautiful semi panoramic view we stayed a week and were pleasantly surprised with 2 complimentary platters of treats the hotel staff was helpful friendly and efficient hotel parking is somewhat expensive but not surprising as the location is so convenient to many activities we watched the exciting fire and water ride at universal studios from above out our window a quick walk takes you to city walk which has several shops and restaurants and street entertainment the hotel offers some shuttle service as well but we did not use it allow extra time for la traffic though we nearly missed our plane home;4
hotel ticked all the boxes really except for limited wifi location was perfect for all activities and sights staff were friendly and approachable and service was very good very pleased would return;4
the location of this hotel next to universal studios was why we chose it i felt it was overpriced and everything from the gift shop to the cafã© was extremely overpriced beds were full sized when most hotels are queen especially in this price range;4
overall good several upgrades to the property including thermostats and improved heat and ac great location across the street from lincoln center could still be upgrades to newer but it has been improved since last year;4
my wife and i stayed at the wyndham new yorker in september 2015 for 4 nights the room was realtively small but what we were expecting it was clean and comfortable the bathroom had little accommodation for hanging items or setting anything down the concierege was very friendly and helpful the location was ideal about the only complaint we had was there was no express checkout and there were too few staff to accommodate the number of people trying to check out at the same time that made for a bad memory to end the trip;4
i stayed at this hotel a year ago and already wrote a review of my stay the location was excellent and our room was very good be aware they do have a night club on the roof and in season it can be loud so avoid rooms that are a floor below it we had such a room and the bass shook our room we moved rooms and all was fineindeed the rooms we had looked out on a postcard view of the fountain at lincoln center when it snowed one night it was even more beautiful the reason for this review was to mention 2 stand out staff i forgot to do this last time michelene at the front desk was a pleasure to deal with chris a concierge was friendly and very helpful he always took helping us an extra step and really seemed to care about what we did;4
i was attending world travel market and although i need to be close to the market place but unfortunately all acceptable hotels where fully booked so i decided to accommodate in abercrombie house i booked dbl room with my colleague mate its lovely place 3 min walking from main hammersmith station staff very helpful rooms very clean and 5 min walking from primark mall i went the primark in oxford street main one but i thanked god that i have mine 5 min walking from abercone also its 25 min from heathrow airport on the end of street starbucks cafe you can have your breakfast easily and all what you need surrounded in the area and away from noise and its not that far away from main tourism district im delighted to book at it with very nice price compare to;4
excellent hotel great location and staff just dont stay in a room that ends in the number eleven it is adjacent to the maids closet and the noise is disruptive now i have to add 35 characters for the review to upload;4
perfect location to access many of the sites and activities of nyc i had reserved two identical rooms one was amazing the second was subpar in many small details and one big issue a non working heater for two out of five nights but the cost was the same;4
stayed here 4 nights with my wife and two teenage daughterslocation is perfectright next to the lincoln centerwe prefer this location over times squarehotel is above averagetry to win it on priceline like we did and it becomes an excellent propertywould certainly return;4
i recently stayed at the empire hotel and had a great experience the location is great with central park only a block away and a short 15 minute walk to time square the room was a little small and the bathroom was even smaller but the service the hotel provides more than makes up for it with so many things to see and do we had no need for cabs and we found new yorkers to be very friendly and helpful when we needed information on the area the front desk helped us plan our tour bus which is a must when traveling in new york city as we were able to see all of the most beautiful and important sites it was a shame that most of the museums were shut because of the government closer but we still found plenty to dothe restaurant next door is a nice place to go after a long day;4
i was pleased with my stay i just had to request room service each day the staff was excellent the breakfast was great a little expensive had a great experience at the hyatt i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone;4
after reading reviews on this hotel i was a bit uneasy as id already booked itbut rooms were cleaned daily even on xmas daythey were basic but we only slept and showered and was out all daywe had no problems at allyes lift was a bit slow at times but not a massive problemyou pay for what you getand we got this at a really good price so no need for all the bad reviewswould stay here again;4
i have been to many hotels of all different stars but this hotel stood out for 2 reasons firstly the staff were so friendly helpful and happy you donât get that everywhere glenny p went above and beyond to help with a problem with my room travel agents mistake they were completely full and by her powers of persuasion or her charisma she managed to keep us in the room we needed the room was clean and comfortable and sort of quiet lol hope you enjoyed the wine and flowers glenny x secondly the location is great just in the quieter part of manhattan itâs great for eating and shopping the proper down to earth american way 2 main roads columbas and broadway go on for miles and have every type of shop you could want the subway is so easy to use but get a guide itâs;4
hotel is very close to times square but also easy walking distance of hells kitchen where we had some great cheaper meals also handy for central park and the hop onoff bus staff very friendly helpful and knowledgeable we had breakfast in the hotel every morning which was ok and reasonably priced the air conditioning is noisy as previous reviewers have said they are not just being picky and the street below is busy and noisy all through the night but this is to be expected due to its location and it wouldnt put us off staying again the bed was really comfortable the best i have ever slept in and the room was fine free tea and coffee is available in the mornings and iced water is available at all times in the lobby and nice bar area too we really liked this;4
stayed here on our anniversary and they took great care of us rooms were overbooked however we were upgraded to a suite on 43rd floor msg a stone throw away great central area great for shopping as well;4
hotel is comfortable and conveniently located near the finish area of the nyc marathon also located across the street from subway to ferry terminal and start of marathon many great restaurants in the immediate area we will stay here again when running in the marathon next year;4
i have stayed at the new yorker about 5 times now i like the hotel but even with nyc standards the rooms are pretty small the housekeeping staff was top notch and they kept everything very clean and were prompt when we needed extra towels we would have liked to have a coffee maker or keurig in the room the location is great and fine if you donât mind the hustle and bustle of the city i would stay here again;4
this is the second time i have stayed at this hotel and i recommend it its location is excellent and there are many bars and restauarants in the immediate area the rooms are comfortable though i would like to have had some drawers for unpacking our room had a large wardrobe for clothes but no drawers and limited shelving staff are always helpful and friendly nick was friendly and welcoming at checkin;4
i stayed at the jane in july 2009 for about 4 nights the hotel is in a great location in new york down a fairly quiet cobblestone street alongside the hudson i had an excellent view of the statue of liberty from the bathroom the rooms are very small but they have all the essentials great for solo travellers at the time of my visit there were still a lot of renovation activities going on however that did not detract from my stay great value in new york excellent reception staff particularly when they got to know you dont miss the meatpacking district the highline negatives the gouging on my credit card to cover incidentals which was refunded but excessive just the same;4
this is nice iconic new york hotel right across the street from the entrance to the metropolitan opera its not the swankiest hotel for sure but it is clean and comfortable and a perfect location by south central park and the west side of midtown;4
very centrally placed hotel from the 1930s with a rich history some of which is told in an interesting display on the lower level i was there for 7 days initially and was lucky to be put in room 1951 with a great view towards the empire state building and a little more space than some other rooms housekeeping is efficient and the rooms are clean and well maintained on checking in a week later for my last night in new york before leaving the us i was asked to the members check in deskthere mohammed i hope i have his correct name was very obliging and arranged room 3730 for me with a view over the city to the hudson river a very nice way to say goodbye to the city i ate at the tic toc diner on a number of occasions and the staff were always pleasant and obliging on my;4
not a newer hotel but what you would expect at this price clean and roomy with friendly and helpful staff;4
great place to stay safe neighbourhood clean private bathroom can choose smoking or nonsmoking rooms with a coffee machine and even a grain bar to eat is supplied in the room which is great if you get back to your hotel hungry or want to take it with you to eat later it is situated right around the corner literally from the subway and a short walk to central park and the natural history museum if you are going to use the hop on hop off dont bother getting tickets before hand you can get them in the hotel lobby in the morning and catch the bus right from near the hotel itself miriam at the front desk was most delightfully friendly and helpful and an assest to the hotel not central to times square but then it works out much less expensive to stay here at a;4
i stayed at this hotel for about 11 days i was upgraded for a king size room when initially i booked for a twin size room staff is great overall and quite helpful one of the cleaning ladies was a little impolite for some reason and would not clean the room or take any trash out other than that i loved the hotel and its amazing location to all of nycs hotspots when checking out i was assisted by one of the staff named jeff he was particularly helpful and offered advice in deciding which taxi service should i use and estimated how much it might cost depending on the place i am headed to all in all its highly recommended;4
we weâre slightly worried about our stay at this hotel due to the mixed reviews however we had no issues at all and really enjoyed our time at the new yorker on arrival the lady who checked us in was really polite and helpful we had booked a standard queen room with no view but she upgraded us we had breakfast included and were given coupons for the tick tock diner we had breakfast there 2 mornings and we enjoyed our food yes the rooms are small and a little dated but it was very clean and the bed was comfortable the hotel is in a good location and i would recommend it to anyone travelling to nyc donât be put off by the negative comments thank you for a lovely trip;4
great location close to everything just a short walk to times square had a wonderful view security was good always asked to see our key card before allowing anyone on the elevators great to have a 24 hour restraunt onsite;4
i recently stayed at the empire hotel i have staying here for years when i need a place to crash in new york its location is ideal with subways restaurants central park and lincoln center only steps away the staff is very helpful and pleasant the rooms are nicely decorated while not cheap it is well worth the price;4
my wife and i stayed for an overnight while visiting universal theme park we stayed on a sunday night so that we could visit the park early on monday the checkin was fast and pleasant we were given a corner king room on the 21st floor i believe the room was remodeled in the past year it seemed fairly new the room was spacious with lots of ambient light the bathroom as large as well with a counter for the coffee maker and a single sink the tubshower was ok though i would prefer a shower stallwater pressure was excellent the amenities were the usual peter thomas roth and included a mouthwash and shower gel closet was large and included robes and slippers the king bed and bedding was very comfortable nightstands on both sides of the beds with lamps including;4
stayed here for a recent surgical procedure to keep from having to sit in traffic for an early arrival and afterward a much nicer hotel than you would expect in this area nice courteous staff clean rooms and common areas we had a nice room with balcony overlooking the courtyard there was a nice common balcony area on our floor my husband said that breakfast was good good select of restaurants that deliverhad some great italian food parking fee but it was nice to have secure parking in that area will definitely stay here again;4
the character of this hotel is undeniable a welcome change from the cookie cutter places out there loved the uniformed staff and the ambience i appreciated my single bed very close to the bathroom and with a view of the hudson drawback though was the jet engine hair dryers they use in the bathrooms they can clearly be heard all night long as people dry their hands paper towels anyone seems it would eliminate this problem not to mention keep in character with the hotel dimmers on the lights nice touch appreciated the fan option and the hooks very smart it was not clear the water was free didnt find out till now a note would have been appreciated discovered bikes were free after i left also;4
the location is greatvery close to everything access from the jfk airport is 1h approximately airtrain line e rooms are a little small but when its only for sleep its convenient ticktoc cafe was goodpancakes are awesomemmmmmm luggage storage is a bit expensive2 per piece of luggage 1 when dropping them off 1 when collecting them front desk is very helpful and gentlesecurity is present and make you feel safe within the hotel;4
stayed here with family and was a good trip checking in was quick and seamless we had two double rooms although we asked for a double and a twin room however they were not able to provide this as they were fully booked surely when we booked they should have told us this and not waited till we were at the hotel rooms were nice but very very small but again only sleep in them so not the end of the world the bathroom also very small shower was nice but again small and cramped and no matter how much you tried to keep the water from going out the shower you just couldnt so there was always a soaking wet floor after you had a shower location is fantastic and right near a subway station would maybe look for somewhere different next time but for a last minute place id;4
ive stayed here twice and i really love the location and the staff josã© at the front desk is great and so helpful he upgraded our room free of charge so we would have more space 4 people chris at the concierge is amazing too he really knows his stuff the only reason i cant give it five stars is because you have to pay for wifi good place to stay for a business triptrip with significant other;4
the hotel offers comfortable and clean rooms very good bathrooms and a great location for a reasonable price you can pick coupons at the front desk to have discount on breakfast in nearby restaurants subway station is just around the corner but you can also walk down broadway or alonside central park and reach times square and west village for instance i would definitely stay at days inn broadway again;4
small clean nice ive been to hotel all over the world and this fits perfectly in its category the location is much better than what i had expected walking distance to everywhere no restaraunt but there are plenty of cafã©s and dinners that did not fail to please i would not only recommend it id go back to it exactly what i was expecting a place to stay in nyc;4
a nice hotel with a very good location about 30 seconds away from madison square garden awesome view over the empire state and around 15 minutes walk to times square we were four people and paid 134 per night for a room with two queensized beds that were very comfy the room wasnt that big so we were a bit tight but it wasnt too bad the bathroom was nice and clean and the showers very hot nice there was no breakfast included and the hotel breakfast place right next door connected to the actual hotel was ok the wifi in the room was actually pretty good so we didnt have to go down to the lobby for once overall a good stay even though it has a few things that could be better;4
we had a great time location could not be better very centralized subway entrance literally across the street macys and empire state a few blocks away starbucks across the street and familia italian which was very tasty and delivers for those nights your feet are done walking hotel customer service was superb made my daughters birthday very special we stayed 9 days would certainly stay again renovated rooms very clean do not recommend tick tock diner downstairs hate to say anything negative since our hotel stay was flawless lots of places to eat nearby early and late will recommend the new yorker not really 45 star but the location service and renovated floors make it feel that way great stay cant wait to return;4
i would quite particularly like to thank the doorman who is so kind with children and adults a very good hotel for a short stay in front of central park ilts a bit difficult to take the subway on week end because the closest line is closed you must walk to find an othe line;4
the location was good my business was in the upper west side of nyc just blocks away the price was very reasonable all i needed was a clean safe place to sleep for one night after arriving around midnight at the hotel i started by day at 730 in the morning the hotel did all that was required even the wakeup call was ontime toilettes were good bottle water in room was a bonus my only negative was a louder than expected window airconditioner unit it was a little loud but i feel asleep i would stay there again;4
love coming to the new yorker right across the street from penn station and madison square group easy walk to theatre district rooms are comfortable bathrooms a bit outdated staff very friendly and helpful tick tock diner in hotel has excellent breakfasts ð;4
just returned after 4 nights at the new yorker the hotel is right opposite penn station which was fantastic as we got the train from the airport the hotel is art deco style and has a huge reception check in was quick and we arrived in our double room on floor 21 the room was ok it was slightly outdated decor wise but it was clean and had a bath and a shower they made the bed each day and changed the towels the bed was really comfortable and there was a tv and a small wardrobe with a safe in it there was no kettle or tea coffee facilities which was a shame as all you wanted in the morning was a coffee however opposite the hotel is a starbucks roughly 5 a coffee or a macdonalds about 3 a coffee there is also 2 supermarkets 1 minute walk next door should you need;4
we booked for our daughters 18th for a 4 night stay leading up to christmas at the new yorker unfortunately the room our daughter and relative were staying in was a queen double but it was late and we were tired we had asked for a good room for our daughter and relative the next morning mohamed helped us out despite being fully booked he moved our daughter and relative to a twin room and as it was a different floor my husband and i also moved and to be honest to a nicer larger room the hotel is nearly 100 years old and as its cold outside quite draughty around the windows it is a stunning hotel excellent location very helpful accommodating staff thank you mo for helping us ððð;4
overalll this hostel which in our opinion exceeded all expectations for a hostel was an excellent choice in accomodation within close proximity via highly accessoble public transport to all major tourist attractions location the hostel is in hammersmith a great neighbourhood and approximately 3 minutes from the main bus and train stations both of which have easy access to london and popular areas such as shepeherds bush for westfield one of the largest shopping centres in europe and notting hill room and amenities we stayed on the first floor in a private double room with an ensuite bathroomshower basin and toilet the room was very clean and comfortable and serviced our basic needs which were to sleep and shower the only thing ee would add is that given we chose;4
we stayed at this hotel couple times now and when weve been there last weekend they renovated everithing in the rooms it looks nice and clean defenetly going back there without forgeting to mention the help we got from eva thank you very much;4
i stayed here with my daughter jan 2015 the rooms were nicely appointed and the renovation was tastefully done i did not find the area walking friendly but then again i did not try to venture out without my car the courtyard looks lovely in the photos and i was looking forward to reading my book there in the am however they never put out the cushions or made it usable pool was lovely has a surprisingly good view for the middle of the city handy to everything excellent parking facilities all in all a good place to base oneself out of to see la;4
i stayed here for three nights its great for the business traveler the hotel is big something like 20 floors its right on the universal studio block as i was traveling for business the proximity to this was not meaningful i had one of the corner rooms the room was very nice large enough to feel roomy but not huge due to the corner shape the bathroom was very big and well appointed best things food i ordered room service as i got back late the food is reasonably priced as is very good im from ny and have and fra divalo before but this was great service very polite staff everyone says hello one odd encounter during a busy spot at the bar the bartender got into an argument with one of the waiters who came back behind the bar to get a;4
the hotel was built in art deco style and this continues into the rooms although there had clearly been some renovation in our room as the shower and bath were new but the hand basin and fittings appeared original there is a display of photographs in the basement of how it once was it is in close proximity to many sights and places of interest in downtown new york our room was clean comfortable and quiet reception made sure we were placed away from the building noise and we got a good nights sleep room facilities included an iron and ironing board as well as a television alarm clock with power sockets and a good wifi connection breakfast is served in the tick tock diner which is within the hotel property if staying at the hotel pickup discount vouchers for;4
i booked this hotel for a very large group 62 people from the very first contact with the sales manager to the checkout after staying four nights i was absolutely satisfied the service was excellent everybody was friendly and helpful the rooms are in a good condition i always felt safe the location is excellent there is a subway station right around the corner of course if you want something totally upscale then decide for another hotel as for me i will definitely choose this hotel for my next visit to new york and will also recommend this place to my friends;4
yes the room is quite small if you will stay longer or you like traditional american hotels with large king size beds and spacious rooms the best tip i can give you is look for another place if you are looking for a well located place for just a couple of nights you dont bother to sleep in a ship cabin yes thats exactly what it is and share the toilette with others the jane is your place the hotel is 10 minutes walking from the nearest metro station and close to the best manhattan can offer for a reasonable price everything is perfectly clean and the service is worthy of a pompous hotel moreover you can borrow a bike for free from them and easily go around nyc i would definitely consider to stay in the jane again when i come back to manhattan;4
we love the location of the empireit is so close to a lot that we like to do movies restaurants lincoln center central park enjoyed a drink at the rooftop lounge as it wasnt closed for a private party this time;4
had a wonderful stay here with my family the room was very nice and clean the shower pressure was strong and the employees are so friendly the room itself also had a fantastic view of universal studios the hotel is close to universal studios so you can either take the shuttle or walk we would definitely stay here again the only issue of not was that the elevators were not all working which definitely impacted wait times;4
thoroughly enjoyed our weeks stay at the empire hotel yes the hotel has a faults the shower doesnt have a door so the floor gets flooded after use the room could do with an update a little tired the lobby and bar area were very cosy with a great atmosphere the bar staff were very nice throughout our stay but the star of the hotel was maggie at reception always at hand and very helpful;4
very good experience just across the opera house tiny expensive rooms but here the benefit is locationlocation and location busy lobby with wifi no breakfast included starbucks at the corner right next to the metro line 1 to central park;4
rooms are very clean staff is extremely friendly overall i had a fantastic stay i wish the bar area had more seating throughout the day you can hear the planes from your room but its not too bad the only issue i had was the method of paying for parking;4
just left the hotel this morning after a 5 night break the rooms are out dated however the art deco feel about the building and its heritage makes you except the fixtures fittings its extremely clean and the bright white bed sheets makes it all worth while the views are stunning and the situation is perfect for site seeing staff are polite and the bar at street level show a whole new reflection on capitalism watch the suited guys scurrying back from their offices and the next to comea black chap on crack cocaine wobbling across the side walk if you like people watching do it macys just around the corner with some great places to eat near by only grip no tea making facilities for us brits is unbearable and you do get charged 15 a day for wifi its says it;4
the new yorker was built in 1929 still has the art deco original feel to it renovated since of course there are loads of elevators reception staff are friendly john who arranges transport was brilliant the rooms are small but clean nicely decorated the bathrooms are still dated but clean dont let this put you off this iconic hotel we had a free bottle of champagne as it was our honeymoon didnt try the barrestaurant but used the tick tock diner every day which had a good range of food with a bar;4
great location for arts lovers just across the road to the lincoln center close to carnegie hall and easy access to all major galleries and museums central park a few blocks away lovely in the snow;4
we stayed here for 5 nights and were really happy with the hotel the room on the first night was far too small 1020 the bathroom was tiny and the bed took up almost all the space however on ringing reception they were really helpful and upgraded us to a bigger room for the rest of our stay clean rooms and v comfy beds jeff in the lobby was really helpful with getting taxis and looking after our bags while waiting for our transfer 10 min walk from times square and close to lots of bars etc the only problem was no drink making facilities in the room tea and coffee available in the lobby in the mornings along with a limited breakfast for 12 with so many diners close by we never ate there good hotel can highly recommend;4
within a day of our stay it was easy to imagine why this at one time was the hotel of the iconic hollywood stars it is beautifully and well appointed in all aspects of the hotel the traditions of second to none service has been maintained to the present timethe staff are extremely friendly professional attentive and skilled in every aspect of service to our stay there is no word to describe the high level of cleanliness of the entire hotel luxurious comfort should say it all my favourite area was the courtyard but the morning cafe was a perfect way to start a great day fabulous food presentation and preparation cheerful service and a pleasing environment access to get to downtown hollywood is quite easy but it comes with the requirement to be trusting the subway;4
great location for universal city rooms were nice and we had a great view good consierge service as well book la la land tours if you get a chance 6 hour tour for 80 a person was a great bargain pool was very nice as well;4
we recently stayed here to celebrate a birthday and anniversary we got an upgrade to a room with a view which was amazing the hotel was perfect for where and what we needed the room was great and with a nice bathroom staff were friendly and efficient and the complementary champagne was a lovely treat;4
hotel was brilliant as it was only a short walk to times square so you didnt have walk out into huge crowds close to shops cafes and central park there is also a whole foods supermarket close by interesting fact it was the hotel used in gossip girl;4
recent vacation was to universal studios very close to universal studios we wakes there the two days we were there we stayed there three nights the hotel from the time we arrived to the time we left was awesome very accommodating to our needs as a guest didnt ask for much things but one of the worker came to check if we needed anything on one of our days there we werent from there so they let us keep our bags with the hotel from the time we arrived before check in and after the time we checked out and because we werent leaving until later on that night although the pool was closed we made the best out of the the hot tub crowded my son forgot his wallet at the hotel and we called the hotel and they were able to find it with everything still in there a big;4
i paid for room with miles so my expectations were not high i was surprised with a well appointed clean room though it was very small it was good for single night stay location next to lincoln center was excellent;4
very large hotel well restored with a lot of character many elevators but not sure they all work as we always seemed to wait for the same two security visually looks at your key before approaching the elevators so safe feeling everyone was nice two restaurants on site one is 24 hours and more casual the second serves food to about 10pm with bar open for a few hours after bathrooms and room s in general are very small typical of new york hotels in the city doorman does not assist you at any point in time nice touch however just wave hello as he is probably on his cell phone anyway housekeeping forgot to refresh my room for two days so keep an eye out for them everyone at checkin was very nice;4
my only complaine was the shower head only the handheld piece was working this is fine but kind of annoying considering the price for the room the big posiitve is the location if youâre planning to do anything around lincoln square also the are plenty of seats and tales just across the hotel to sit an have your starbucks with is next door or eat a sandwich or wahetver this was a relazxing surprise that you wonât find at hotels in the crowded area near port uthority pann station or time square;4
hotel has great art deco interior easy walk to penn central subway and madison square gardenlocated in the hotel is the tic toc diner open 24 hrs solid diner food and reasonable prices all staff friendly and helpful basic room adequate a bit small;4
if you like not a average hotel then you have to go there a bit old but with charm it si now the fifth time i have been there and it is stil ok my friends had a problem in the batroom that was compensated with a breakfast i think by jennifer ask for a superior room front and quieter great location friendly doorman and good bari will be back guys;4
we wanted to escape home and the winter doldrums but every hotel in new york was through the roof for presidents weekend then we found that proverbial needle in a haystack an actual bargain not just cheap dirt cheap the jane only 99 bucks a night ok as they say you get what you pay for and heres what we were paying for a teensyweensy room and i use the word room loosely youd be better off thinking closet equipped with bunk bedsand not much else you use a shared bathroom down the hall my husband and i are not young far from nor are we hipsters like the enormous crowd of attractive 20something clubgoers we had to wade through late saturday night just to get inside the front door alsoonce inside we discovered one reason why the hotel might;4
arrived 15 minutes before check in to avoid a que was asked to pay â£10 for early check in so declined and stood and waited no where to sit in reception also to get to reciption with all our bags and a baby in a pram there was a big stair hair into the hotel didnât see a ramp i did ask and was told there wasnât one luckily the hotel had a lift to get to the rooms the room was modern clean and very nice the bath was very slippy every room should have a bath mat in it they turned off the hot water at 11am check in was 12 they should have waited the extra hour breakfast finishes at 11am too so we had to wake up an hour earlier than planned we had a busy day ahead and wanted to sleep breakfast was good great selection cleaning dining and pleasant surroundings the;4
great location good quality but breakfast was cool 2 days out of 3 its as if the pass lights were not used also quite a bit of building noise early morning more noticeable as we like to sleep with tht window open;4
a friend and i booked the days inn hotel through expedia as it was one of the only hotels we could get a twin doubles room but then got worried after seeing reviews on tripadvisor however when we got to the hotel we were pretty pleased the lobbys lovely with seemingly period features although slightly ruined by all the left luggage stranded while people waited for flights could they not have found a room somewhere the initial receptionist wasnt that friendly but everyone else who served us throughout the 5 days was better the room was a good size no creepy crawlies spotted and it was cleaned daily really good shower although there was a knack to flushing the toilet the tv reception was mixed and we were at the back of the hotel so didnt have an;4
i felt that this hotel was in an excellent location for my city break and provided us with pretty much everything that we needed the room itself wasnt too bad however was quite dark and there was no free wifi in the room just in the lobby free coffee in the morning was great and the value for money fantastic;4
if you are going to events in and around lincoln center this should be your choice in a hotelthr lobby is elegant and the service is quite good rooms are a little small but comfortable nicely decorated and with efficient temperature control they are meant for tall people however i had to stand on tiptoe to hang up my clothes and the switch to change the shower from wand to rainhead was so over my head 5â 2â that i had to call housekeeping he was there in an instant and we had a good laugh;4
i was only here for one night however the front desk staff was fast and friendly the room that we were in was very small and in a corner hallway and no other rooms around so it was a little creepy at first and very loud elevators the hotel has so much history and love how close it is to empire and time square we would stay here again if ever in nyc;4
stayed here for 6 nights to celebrate my birthday and received a fantastic reception as well as a bottle of bubbles in my room when i returned from discovering new york for the first time which was a wonderful surprised i have to say housekeeping deserves major acknowledgement for their hard work and quick response to any requests friendly staff all around which made it feel like home some thicker duvets would make the beds a bit more cosy in my opinion as well as fuller pillows however these were minor issues the shower was a bit odd though and had some leaks but also a minor issue would consider coming back if the hotel had a revamp and had a refurb for their utilities also location was fantastic central park a stone throws away and times square a few minutes down;4
nice clean hotel staff were friendly location was great cafe over road slightly down hill is amazing well priced amazing food room was a good size location was great metro stop in just across street easy access to all of new york highly recommended for price;4
we stayed in a penthouse room on the 13th floor from july 1519 it was under 200night including taxes everything looked brand new and was very clean i was expecting a small room because its in nyc but this room was surprisingly big it had a couch a desk nice flat screen tv king bed etc i was very satisfied with my stay in the hotel the subway was 2 minutes from the hotel and there is also a stop 2 minutes away for the hop n go tour bus which is phenomenal by the way i would definitely recommend this hotel just book a renovated room on one of the top floors and you will love it i would stay here again the next time i am in the city;4
very nice weekend stay at the empire conveniently located across the street from lincoln center the staff especially nick at the front desk was friendly and helpful while the room was on the smallish side but really not too bad it was comfortable clean and elegant used the fitness room which was perfectly serviceable at least there were three treadmillsthough one was out of serviceand free weights weve stayed here several times before and it has always been consistently good in fact we decided to stay in the city we live in jersey not too long ago because we were attending the beach boys 50th anniversary tour at the beacon theatre not too far away while checking out we ran into brian wilson mike love al jardine bruce johnston and david marks who were;4
we decided to splurge and stay at a nice hotel close to universal for our vacation this year we usually try for lowerpriced decent hotels the hotel was very nice had an excellent restaurant and lounge a beautiful view a great pool and was very close to universal 10 minute walk the shuttle service was nice as well the only thing that was surprising was the size of the beds we had a double room and assumed there would be queen beds but they were full or double beds we had bigger beds at the much less expensive best western during the first leg of our vacation in santa monica we had two adults and two kids so a little challenging other than that we had no complaints and would stay there again;4
the hilton in universal city was a great choice for us we travelled to la in june as a young couple for sightseeing the hilton had everything and more you want in a hotel the rooms were a good size and nice with great amenities the beds were comfortable and i have never had such good house keeping the place was sooooo clean and refreshed everyday after house keeping after being out for 10 hours at a time it was so nice to come home to a clean room the only negative was it was expensive in the business centre to use the internet as for location we found universal city to be fine we loved that we were close to the citywalk which had a movie theatre shops and restaurants everywhere it was really easy after a long day out to go somewhere close by for dinner as for;4
never been to the big apple had a heck of time finding somewhere with double beds i was traveling with my 19 and 16 year old daughters and as their father this was a tough thing to find the room a big enough by nyc standards from what i was led to believe we cant complain we were very dissapointed by the housekeeping though they were very late in the day to clean and not terribly responsive to a few minor requests we had little interaction with any other staff except briefly on the roof bar on sunday evening before we headed off to a wedding they were great but a bit slow as other reviews commented it can be a bit noisy by totally bearable all in all a good experience;4
this is my third time at this hotel people on front desk are always kind the concierges are so pleasant the location is very good if youâ´re lucky enough you can get a room with a terrifc view of central park definately a place to stay when youâ´re in nyc;4
i like this upper west side hotel for its terrific location across the street from the lincoln center with five very good restaurants near by and near enough to several museums yes the rooms are small you are in nyc what are you doing in your room but they are priced appropriately for the size of the room the street view is lovely but can be a tad noisy the rooms at the back of the hotel are more quiet the staff is friendly and efficient a good value for a nice hotel in a great location;4
we have stayed at a different lax hotel before on a layover we ended up needing to take a cab and getting it reimbursed as the hotel included airport shuttle i didnt want to deal with that i wanted the most reliable shuttle service at the airport it worked out for us we got in really late we hardly slept but had to go somewhere and then out the door to pick up the shuttle we jumped on a shuttle right away and it looked like there was another one right after it either we got really lucky or the service was really good with back ups im sure the hotel had nice amenities too but we needed a bed and shuttle;4
the room was comfortable and well appointed and i had requested a room facing the street which turned out to have a wonderful view there is a starbucks around the corner which is nice for breakfast the hotel seems to have only inroom breakfast the staff is very nice but the front desk is understaffed they really should have more than two people there the front desk staff are as efficient as they can but the rush arrival and departure times can make for long waiting times but all the staff is very nice i want to mention in particular one wonderful front desk employee minerva who was incredibly kind and helpful despite her multitask obligations she took time helping me with the computer in the business center addressing my multiple queries and resourcefully;4
iâve been staying the hollywood hotel for the past month plan to stay for 2 more iâm in the area for work i initially booked over the phone with pil i told him my requests he delivered i book week by week with pil he always goes above beyond to meet my expectations thank you soooo much pil;4
the hotel itself is in a great location very easy to get to the subway and go anywhere in the city if youre staying in nyc for more than 4 days id recommend buying the 30 subway pass for unlimited rides the hotels location is pretty hard to beat though even if you are just looking to walk around you can walk to many attractions without using the subway ive been to nyc 5 times and stayed in various hotels although the rooms in nyc hotels are usually pretty small this hotel had the smallest room ive ever been in my wife and i stayed in the metro queen bed room there was very little room to put both of our bags and be able to walk around the room comfortably the room was so small that it had a couple of electrical outlets that we could access we made;4
im a hilton honours diamond member so always opt for the reliable hilton brand this one didnt disappoint comfy spacious rooms pleasant staff decent drinks and food and a good concierge service hotel is great for visiting universal studios but also for visiting hollywood and other areas of los angeles which are a short cab ride away a few niggles found the pool nice but very dirty both in the water and around the edge needs some attention also the pool bar was open until 830pm on friday and then only 6pm on sunday which we found a bit odd the free breakfast for diamond members was pathetic to say the least and no water in rooms basically no extra privileges for diamond members which was unusual overall a nice stay but not the best hilton ive stayed;4
this was our second hotel in la stayed here for 4 nights as it was close to universal hotel was huge and very clean staff were always pleasant we had an excutive room on floor 21 over looking universal room was large with 2 double beds but i would not pay extra again for this room the only benifit was the free breakfast and soft drinks but other guests were getting the free breakfast that were staying on the other floors so no idea how this worked in all we had a good stay in this hotel but there was a convention going on and the hotel was full of police security people and loads of rude business people our kids were shuffed and pushed on several occassions location for universal you couldnt get better lots of places to eat at city walk and very near;4
i walked from vermontsunset station and entered the lounge areapeople having a great time thought how nice it was to be back to socal checked in found my room which was huge everything worked balcony free soap clean no bugs all of that night plus enjoying the laughtersinging los angeles then back up in a few to shower and feast thanks to chef hugo and his staff noted by previous review voted best breakfast in town walked to chla for a conference in 2 min repeat poked around found pool gym an awesome balcony on 3 smooth check in smooth checkout free printer for air pass;4
we picked hh due to itâ´s location and price itâ´s hard to find hotels in the area that are ok priced and in a good standard the hotel do not have a restaurant which is unfortunate the local area also misses restaurants a lot lot of homeless people in the block adjacent to the pool the pool do not have wifi the room was nice and comfy well cleaned avoid rooms towards north vermont;4
rooms are large and very comfortable the location is ideal for visiting universal studios free shuttle available to universal studio and hollywood walk further in distance from main hollywood strip will need cab or uber is planning to be a around hollywood strip but perfect if visting univeral studios;4
cecile and nancy where so kind and helpful while i stayed in la thank you for watching out for me and your great customer service keep up the great work ladies you both deserve a raise blessings to your amazing success;4
you feel like a rock star at the jane and we had own own terrasse love the flamboyant hendrixlike style of the rooms coxy and sexy nothing too luxurious but a good vibe the breakfast room has great organic food although the coffee is to weak and the bar is a pretty cool walking distance from everything big love;4
friendly stuff at the hotel hotel close to universal studios which was the highlight of our trip at first didnt think it worth seeing until my husband and i got on the train to tour the studios one just has to experience it to appreciate it;4
what you see is what you get the room looked exactly as in the pictures and had a pleasant shower room the bed was very comfortable and services like the buffet store airport shuttle etc made my stay a good experience the only small downside was the room service for lunch which took nearly an hour instead of the promised 25 minutes and by the temperature of the food when it arrived i would guess that it had waited for delivery much longer than necessary;4
very comfortable beds good view from room excellent location next to msg and penn station handy for subway only ate at tick tock once was good enough only downside sometimes a long wait for liftselevator would definitely come back mainly due to the location;4
we stayed here for 2 nights while visiting universal studios it was perfect we could just walk over to the park it was uphill but a quick walk the hotel itself was clean and modern the staff in the lobby bar were terrific enjoyed the breakfast buffet note we usually upgrade to a club room to have access to the lounge this hotel does not have one you just get passes to the buffet it was huge lots of selection my only gripe about the hotel was that the pool was freezing and there was no policing there were kids doing cannonballs into the hot tub while we were trying to relax if the goal was to be close to the theme park we would stay here again;4
the newyorker is situated beside madison square gardens a stones throw from times square we were warned before we went that nyc hotel rooms are small and yes they are but as you are just sleeping there it really wasnt an issue the check in process was seamless great security helpful staff nice bar happily recommend this place if you are in nyc;4
my wife and i stayed here for 2 nights and it was lovely a little wait for check in but that was fine the room was super small but hey when youre in new york thats really the last place you want to be lots of amenities right on your doorstep the hotel is full of history lots of original features here which is great apart from you can hear all the neighbouring rooms turn a tap turn a handle flush the toilet very hard to stay asleep when you can hear this but we saw past that staff were all very friendly hotel very well maintained and clean we would definitely stay here again on our next trip;4
the hollywood hotel offers good service comfort security and a decent breakfast included clean airy and with good location met our expectations reasonable rates friendly service and location close to sights;4
the location is really nice very close to penn station on 34th street empire state building is within 10 mins walk lots of restaurant and pharma around the area and just 1520 mins walk to times square the standard room is good enough for 2 not too spacious but comfortable enough staff are really nice and friendly if youre planning to be out anyway the whole day for tours then this is just perfect to be your sleeping ground;4
after a bad experience in another ny hotel it was a pleasant surprise to find this hotel on the upper east side of manhattan the rooms are well appointed clean and the room service is both daily and well done hotels in nyc are expensive but we found days hotel to be good value for money the only criticism relates to the wireless internet which was sporadic at best we are a family of 3 and took a suite and it was well worth while;4
if you need to be close to universal studios or the neighborhood our children live in this hotel is perfectly located room is large bed quite comfortable linens very nice and all was clean carpet a bit tired bathroom is adequate although you can hear activities in bathrooms above and below view is beautiful even if it includes the highway amenities ok missing body lotion wifi in room worked well but why do we have to pay an additional charge one hour free wifi daily in the lobby is appreciated doormen and bell staff especially friendly breakfast at the hotel was not acceptable we just tried it once and went elsewhere the rest of the time;4
what a superb hotelthe hotel seems to go on forever as it is quite large and very soreadoutthe food was excellent and presented with many different varietiesstaff was ever so helpfulit was an amaizingrooms are well kept and very cleanmmanagement and all the staff very friendly and always with us and ask what we need and what we wantim very thankful for everyonewe will hope to see you again;4
i stayed here from 1st 6th september 2017 and it was awesome we were there for labour day at the hotel we had a metro queen room i think it was room 3114 the room was big enough for the 2 of us the bed was quite big and super comfy the air con worked perfectly and was pretty quiet the bathroom was quite small in that if you sat on the toilet you wouldnt be able to close the door also the room had a wardrobe which had a safe and was big enough for both cases more we had a view of madison square garden which was cool too at night it was very quiet considering it was peak season the hotel has a diner attached to it tick tock diner we ate here the first evening has a massive burger for cheap and every morning we came here for breakfast getting a;4
we stayed here for one night after our flight from the uk rooms are clean and comfortable hotel is right next to the airport but there was no noise from aircraft restaurant was good for hot and cold food;4
loved the artdeco appearance of it all friendly and professional staff fantastic location on the south west corner of central park subway nearby the whole family loved it here if i had to criticise i would say we had a tiny bathroom which was in need of a little tlc but nothing major to spoil the experience the swimming pool and surroundings on the roof was disappointing not like the photos online breakfast is far too expensive to entertain use cafeskiosksrestaurants nearby;4
would have given 5 circles but there we a ton of people in the evening but not many elevators on line we booked through bookingcom and got a great rate then a week before arrival got an offer for a high floor with a view for an extra 34 a night so worth it we lucked out with a view that included the chrysler and empire state buildings near times square trains madison square garden on several bus routes and near subway;4
we stayed in a family terrace suite for one night we were supposed to stay longer but i had called a week before to change the reservation the person i spoke to said the confirmation number was the same i should have called back to make sure everything was set we arrived on friday night after driving around for 2 hours looking for parking see below and the man at checkin said they had expected me the night before and that since i was a noshow they had given my room away i was shocked and told him that was not the case in the end he found us a room and we were all set i wish i remembered his name he was very kind the room itself was very nice the suite we were in was on the 35th floor there was an entryway a huge walkin closet a bedroom with 2 beds;4
the reception was good the room was clean the service was good as well the hotel is close to central park and the metro the minimum you are expecting from an hotel was there nothing less nothing more;4
i heard mixed reviews about the hotel but it is very nice i have stayed in first class hotels many times and this one falls way short of that but the price and location cant be beat staff greeted us warmly upon checkin there was a free minibuffet in the evenings at the bar rooms were clean and ready when we arrived and there was always someone there to push the elevator button for you the hotel was not overly large allowing a nice feeling also if you want to go to universal studios you can just walk there or take their shuttle but remember the shuttle does not leave until 1000 am and the park opens at 900 there were many people waiting outside before 9 am for the shuttle and apparently did not know we walked and were there in 10 minutes perfect;4
the hotel itself is gorgeous some minor repairs and upkeep needed here and there but thatâs understandable in such a busy place the view from the rooftop is next to none you get such a different view of new york without the crowds of being at the empire state an incredible place to visit especially if youâre a gossip girl fan;4
after reading so many reviews about this place varying from either end of the spectrum i wasnt really sure what to expect 10 nights is a long time to stay in a hotel where things arent right so imagine my surprise when i got to the hotel around 1930 after a very long days travel to find that the hotel was actually very nice the layout was tidy clean area very quiet and spacious friendly staff at the reception area welcoming and helpful with any issues or problems we may have had the rooms were spacious we went for a double queen size room as there were three of us staying we couldnt however find the safety security box which was described as part of the room and we could have done with a bit more space to unpack our clothes we ended up living out of our;4
super friendly and attentive staff clean room and bathroom the location is great few blocks from two subway stations central park and columbus circle the only downside is the shower pressure was not that good and someday water wasnt hot enough in the morning;4
they have a revolving door you arenât supposed to touch when you are going through it if it stops you stop it will start again that was one example of a hotel that had a lot of personality located near madison square garden itâs an older place but looks like it has had quite a bit of renovation in recent years they upgraded me to what they called an executive room which seemed small and made me wonder what my original room would have looked like it was fine didnât spend a lot of time there anyway they did need to do some finishing work in the room i noticed a few unfinished rusted spots the wifi worked very well and you are nearby major attractions when checking in i saw a desk separate from the checkin desk it had a wyndham rewards sign on it i;4
this is a great hotel if going to universal and sight seeing in nearby areas the valet parking is reasonable and just fantastic the welcoming staff were lovely there is a shuttle bus to and from universal city walk our bags took a little longer to follow us up to our room but that was it other than that the staff were friendly and conscientious our room was spacious and clean and our bathroom was also spacious the our door pool looked fab with alot of cabanas but have to admit i did not use it overall a lovely experience i would recommend to anyone;4
this hilton is clean and has a perfect location for trips to universal studios or studio city the staff was very nice especially at the hotel bar that has the free appetizers during happy hour rooms are nice but nothing special we could hear some noise from the room on the other side of the adjoining room door but that is expected for that type of room my only complaint is my lack of room upgrade even though i am a hilton diamond;4
we used to live in nyc so we know lots of neighborhoods and places to stay the new yorker is our go tostay at place every time we visit it is convenient to penn station we come in by train and lots of public transportation options right near the new hudson yards too staff are very helpful and the rooms are clean small but then every hotel room in nyc is i have no concerns about recommending this hotel to friends coming in from out of town;4
i stayed at the days inn for one night sunmon and i enjoyed it i was on the 4th floor king size bed walk in closet bathroom is small my room was nice and cool do bring your own shampoo as the one they have is about 1 oz 1oz lotion there are plenty of towels to shower with hand towels 2 small soap bars hair dryer i didnt bring any makeup but they have a special mirror just for putting on your makeup only 1 elevator working left side the floors are small this is nyc they have a soda machine wished they had a snack machine there is a duane reade around the corner 123 subway is 2 blocks away on 96th st plenty of places to eat even mcd great for couples or if youre looking for a solo stay like me you will like it occasionally you hear cabs;4
the hilton is the closest hotel to universal park which is about a 510 minute walk but they do have a shuttle rooms are big and comfortable staff is nice and they have a 25 early checkin option available for early arrivers my only slight complaint and its not with the hotel but when using lyft the hilton is not an option its always the main entrance to universal which gets a little annoying if you use lyft frequently on the trip;4
great location and value for money of staying the rooftop deck was perfect to relax with a watermelon mojito the rooms are very clean it was unfortunate they were doing some work in the lobby so the main bar wasnt accessible and it was very loud but other than that it was an excellent stay;4
we arrived at lax and got the free shuttle bus to the green metro line what an experience scary at first as two 20something english ladies with huge suitcases stuck out like a sore thumb attracting a lot of attention but we found the people were really nice we found the ramada easily 2 minutes walk up from the santa monica metro stop and about 4 minutes down from the perhaps less scary looking sunset boulevard stop and first impressions thought it was a bad area we were allocated a room on the 2nd floor overlooking a little courtyard the room was clean very comfortable bed with fridge and microwave and good shower 3 star is about right for this hotel although weve stayed in many 4 stars in england that are about of this standard and the 4 star in san diego;4
this hotel is more suited for business travelers then vacationers but we enjoyed the stay there was a few minor problems with the room when we arrived but they were addressed very quickly by the staff the small frig in the room was dead on arrival and the staff had a replacement in there within minutes the room was actually huge 1451 with a window that made up an entire wall with an angled view of universal studios and city walk it was quiet and very comfy self parking was 24 a day but it was covered parking the breakfast buffet was good but a bit pricey 60 for 2 people after a 10 discount coupon and i didnt see any other places to eat nearby the staff was very pleasant and helpful would have given it a 5 star but the charges for some things were a bit excessive;4
have now completed two conferences at this location and have loved it both times hotel staff is friendly and accommodating and the facilities available are clean and stylish which is more than most spaces in nyc;4
stayed 7 nights at the new yorker foyer is a grand art deco style and very welcoming staff plentiful even late pm and very early am tick tock the associated diner is open 24 hours for a typical american dining experience the bar trattoria blanco is great for drinks and bar food although rooms are small and compact and might have seen better days they are clean well equipped and comfortable and daily cleaning service was excellent our room was at the front of the hotel on the 22nd floor with a âviewâ of the empire state building there was always a slight buzz of noise from the streets which was actually quite comforting at night trip was planned for my husbands 50th birthday and mohammad at the reception desk did a fabulous job of organising a room;4
we spent our honeymoon at empire hotelit is a beautiful hotel with everithing you can desire the breakfast is very good and the pool is fantastic staff is very qualified in particular pasquale who gave us a great welcome at check in fabio and maria rosaria;4
i shared a bunk bed cabin with a friend for a fourday three night stay in nyc the jane is in a terrific location the neighborhood is lovely and quiet and is located very near the beginning of the high line the staff was very nice and our room was clean in order to save money you do have to be willing to make some sacrifices one sacrifice is each person having a key to the room the way is works is that you have an electronic key attached to a power stick you pick up and leave this key at the front desk that can be a minor annoyance when there is someone ahead of you who is checking in or out but the worst part of this set up is there is no way for one person to leave the room to shower or use the rest room without 1 taking the device that turns on the;4
i have stayed in quite a few hotels by lax i found most of them to be old and with terrible sound proof windows the hyatt regency is a nice modern hotel with celan sleek rooms and most importantly good sound proof windows do not expect luxury but a very decent property by the airport;4
the hotel is situated right opposite central park for a fabulous introduction to nyc we walked the length of the park and into the city if the hotel had been closer wed have missed half the park its so big within a 3 minute walk you can jump on the subway for a 10 minute ride to times square or practically right outside the hotel you can catch a bus and from there you can get anyway at all on manhatten island for 2 and it really helps you get your bearings and see places we got the bus everywhere and really enjoyed seeing the various parts of the city thatd wed have missed from the subway the hotel location is great just a short easy ride into the city and all the major attractions yet sufficiently far away to be able to get a quiet nights sleep a taxi home;4
the building and the room a bit old but clean we love the lobby lounge with the high ceiling the room not thing too special coz a bit out but not bad really the swimming pool on the rooftop that what we like to jumping in our trip was in summer so too many peoples pool is very small but we can sunbathing in the city of manhattan;4
during my visit to new york i stayed at the ameritania hotel in times square from june 2629i am writing this to say how pleased i was with my stay due to the great services of the reception staff member mr algenis mr algenis was happy to ensureâ that i received everything i needed i asked of him to book a flight for me and he was more than happy to helpportraying a lot of patience mr algenis represents great customer service and could be an example to others thank you so much ehud patihi;4
this review is being written now whilst i sit in the lobbyreception area lovely welcome from the door reception and maid staff my daughter and i asked various questions about the best places to eat to what is the best subway to get to our destinations ready to answer our questions and share their knowledge of the area more hotel pics to follow;4
well i didnt have much problems i think this inn its a little far from the most important place but the station of subway is near there are all u need near from inn but the bathroom sometimes were cold water but for me its not soooooooo bad hahahahah i advice u to go there but for a long time;4
charming hotel like the design and atmosphere centrally located rooms are designed beautifully they should insulate the windows though as the noise can be bad at times due to traffic another disappointing thing is charging for wifi this is so old fashioned just add this as a standard to your room;4
we would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend it is relatively affordable by new york standards at least has excellent subway access and staff was very friendly somehow our bed had 2 box springs instead of a boxspring and mattress staff were apologetic and gave us a new better room right away the new mattress was very firm but we prefer that pillow top fans need not apply the windows in the room open and the air conditioner worked great the room was very quiet at night lcd tvs in the rooms and free wifi we will stay here again on our next trip;4
located on the west corner of central park the astor fulfilled all of our needs it is half the price of hotels thirty blocks nearer to town thats a 20 minute walk or a few minutes and two stops on the subway from the hotel to the ferry port its no more than 30 minutes on the subway longer in a taxi it isnt the ritz but its clean friendly and warm we also had a great view of the park there is no food served in the hotel there are great places to eat on columbus two blocks away including the best pizza i have ever tasted at a place called imperial pizzeria it was a show in its self watching it being made as you spend most of your time in town i would recommend spending time sorting places to eat ther overall as a base camp it was great staff were freindly for;4
hotel was a short walk from times square etc but still plenty of amenities nearby slight issue on check in but this was resolved promptly fabulous art deco style hotel and subway right outside penn station and madison square garden are a stones throw away room was smallish like most but clean and maid service was great only had breakfast in the diner on the last day but food was excellent and so quick;4
i have such a mixed feelings on this property so here is my disclaimer i am fighting one bad incident s all the great things so let me start with the bad check in took me over an hour the process was thisi arrived at the hotel to two huge lines so we waited in one line for around 35 min to finally check in the lady at the front counter could not be rudder complaining to her colleagues about how she hated this job and her bad day she then got aggravated with any questions i asked her i was even told sir thats not my problem you should know better than to show up at a hotel before check in time my question was do i now need to wait in the other long line to check my bag as the rooms are not ready or do you have a bellhop who takes bags of new incoming guests which;4
great little place convenient location near lincoln center the gracious center of manhattan good price particularly if you are willing to pay in advance w no refund clean beautiful view from roof bar;4
i stay here at least once a year when traveling to los angeles for business and its always a pleasure the rooms have just been renovated and they are always nice and clean they have a parking lot in the back thats unfortunately about 20night to park in but that seems to be the case just about every nice place you stay in la they have a very small gym in case you wanted to squeeze in a quick workout as well all in all its a very clean and friendly place with a great central location if you are going to be doing a lot of running around all over hollywood and la in general though it is a bit further from some parts of town such as santa monica;4
we had a great trip to the new yorker beautiful art deco style i surprised my wife with a trip to nyc from dc on amtrak and the location is a block from penn street station and msg and we were there to billy joel which i would highly recommend great view of the empire state building the rooms are small and clean i see people saying theyre a little dated but for me its what i expectedyou dont go to nyc to stay in the room there is a diner on the first floor but we didnt eat there the staff was friendly and helpful and the price was what i expected based on the location great coffee pizza and a nice irish pub nearbyand im sure tons more we would definitely stay here again for sure;4
the empire hotel is in the perfect location for everything in newyork the prices are not bad and the rooms are comfortable but the rooms are definitely too small for a family there is great food around the hotel and central park is very close;4
great hotel with great access to universal city the outdoor mall and theme park are all within walking distance hotel rooms are nice and clean the restaurant has a great buffet but its a little pricey i had the chicken caesar salad and it was very good;4
took level 24 premier suite the internet and tv signal were a bit hit and miss no grab rail in shower cubicle not safe the loose cushions on the chairs were rather bosmelly and need cleaning the food was very good the hotel was very clean the entertainment was okay well done pepe for his music outside entertainers were good the staff are fab nothing too much trouble the reception was ok tui reps were super and followed everything through the hotel needs a refurb this doesnt mean that it spoilt our stay but it will be a bonus not wanting to be snooty but i object to paying extra 2 euros for premium drinks downstairs when we have paid more for our holiday than the 22 other floors this is not acceptable would like a response to that from the hotel manager;4
if youre just looking for somewhere to sleep and store your stuff the jane is perfect the rate is much lower than other places as the rooms are tiny and you share a bathroom but this suited us just fine the location is good as it is close to bars and restaurants but the subway stop is a ten minute walk not for everyone;4
i just got back from a long weekendgirls trip to nyc and we had a great experience at the empire hotel we loved the location near the lincoln center and central park the restaurants nearby were wonderful and the hotel was right next to the subway lines we needed for all of the sightseeing we were doing we found the hotel to be clean and attractive we loved the decor in the lobby bar and mezzanine levels it was a lot of fun to relax with a drink in the bar and enjoy the surroundings the room was also nicely decorated and a decent size for a nyc hotel room the pool area and rooftop bar were beautiful most of the hotel staff went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant from the doormen and the front desk to the bartenders and maintenance staff the room did;4
a lovely good quality hotel near broadway and central park exceptional service from all staff really enjoyed relaxing in the bar area with cocktails traffic noise throughout the night was an issue and we were disappointed to miss out on the rooftop bar experience as it had problems with its computer system and could take cash only;4
the location of this hotel is perfect to me it can be reached timesquare central park 5th avenue as well as subway easily nearby there are a lot of restaurants and one 24hour supermarket the neat of hotel cleaning is ok the reception service is average only without smile am i doing something wrong no wifi in room but in lobby please get prepared before if you are going to online in room everything needs to pay in room including bottle of water but the hotel still offers water in lobby that is appreciated for such dry weather the people staying at the gate whose attitude is much better than those in reception they are helpful and friendly;4
amazing location lovely clean modern hotel would highly recommend couldnt get wifi working in the public areas think it needed a code but this was not readily publicised bar drinks were very expensive 16 plus tax plus tip but everything else was amazing staff very helpful and free boarding pass printing was useful;4
we took the trip to new york for opening day with the yankees wouldnât have been the same trip without staying with wyndham we have been staying with wyndham every since our first stay with the company back in 2016 the staff is always awesome not to mention when they found out it was my birthday celebration so they sent up a bottle of champagne on the house always setting the bar â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸;4
customer service was amazing access from the airport was easy rooms were spacious that was our first time in california and the front desk was so helpful with different ideas for us to visit we loved our stay;4
decent hotel great rate excellent location room was small but efficient its manhattan columbus circle is a great central location especially if weather is decent would stay here again;4
we stayed 2 nights with my wife in september 2017 we did not choose to stay in los angeles due to heavy traffic hyatt regency is right next to the airportbut you do not hear aircraft soundroom large and comfortable ä°f you have car there ara a lot of car park near the hotel sunrise car park was very cheap;4
the ameritania is a fine hotel beautifull and clean rooms and after a day of enjoying the city its nice to drink someting at the bar the bartender javier was very helpful we can recommend this hotel;4
we had a family of 4 so room was a little tight they also were double beds so small for a couple and teenage kids the lobby was under construction which was a bit inconvenient luckily they had a great rooftop to hang out on some coffee in lobby in morning would be nice;4
we were given an upgrade when arriving without asking that was really nice after a 16 hours flight it was a nice spacious and just renewed room but the shower was dirty we asked for it to be cleaned but they rather changed us to another room that one was very small and with a run down bathroom elevator service was too slow they gave us one free breakfast though;4
ameritania is located right in the middle incl close to several subway lines nice design good staff and good value for money we were not at all disturbed from other rooms either because the guests were quite ans nice or because the walls were thick and good the ac fan was however not quite as quiet but there is an off button the hotel porter said was very helpful and also identified a valuable lost item as probably belonging to us which was accurate;4
the price of this hotel located on the upper west side is really reasonable and the location is really great within walking distance to central park and american museum of natural history the hotel itself is pretty old but no qualms there as the rooms were clean enough and managed to get a good nights sleep staff were friendly and helpful;4
this is a fabulous art deco building with real character and the location is amazing 3 mins walk to macys and the empire state building the room altho not massive was a fairly good size compared to other new york hotels i have been in the bathroom was compact and a little dated but if you are in new york city and not out and about then something is seriously wrong the staff could not have been nicer i would much rather stay here than a characterless big chain and i look forward to returning my only slight critiscsm was i couldnt get my phone to pick up the wifi signal in the room only the ipad would;4
an impromptu stay in nyc and i was pleasantly surprised to have booked a room on the coveted 13 floorthe penthouse for under 100 obtaining a parking space was dauntingit took 45 minutes my rating would have been higher but venturing to other floors to find a vending machine i found unkept and untidy lower floors i do plan to stay again but only if i can obtain a room on the penthouse floor;4
if youâre looking for something that wonât break the bank in the heart of nyc this is the hotel for you only a 1015min walk in either direction for times sq and central park with lots of bars around beds comfortable air con works very well the only reason it wasnât a 5star review is for the fact that the bed frames are fairly larger than the mattress so there were a few occasions where one of us would stub our toe walking around the bed;4
great location but not cheap staff is much friendlier than before there was a roach in my room but when i told the staff she quickly apologized and moved me to another upgraded room its new york city so i expect critters;4
we stayed for 3 nights in february as part of our honeymoon the hotel is fantastically located close to times square we were able to walk to the majority of the things we wanted to see times sq macys central park broadway etc and we were able to easily get the subway to the 911 memorial and statue of liberty the service was good from all at the hotel and we also enjoyed breakfast in the tick tock diner and a cocktail in the vault our room was on the 20th floor and although in was small it provided all that we needed and was always very clean we had a problem with a blocked toilet and it was sorted very quickly overall a lovely stay for our first time in ny;4
we chose this hotel for its close proximity to universal studios and its good reviews the shuttle bus to universal studios runs regularly and stops outside the hotel self parking for staying guests is 28 taxes per night an la city tour bus also stops outside the hotel all the staff we met were great the bed in our room was super comfortable and the room well appointed with fridge and coffee machine the carpet however was badly stained the bathroom was well appointed with a good supply of towels and a hairdryer we were amazed that there is no complimentary wifi for a hotel of this standard it would be expected there is a free chilled water dispenser in the lobby which was very welcome;4
we stayed for 4 nights in the premier plus room decided to upgrade to treat ourselves the room looked really nice clean very quiet and the bed was very comfortable included in the room was free bottled water which is great but you have to ask at the desk every day for another bottle and theyre never too happy about it their ultimate wifi is included in premier plus but its very difficult to get a signal and when you eventually do it disconnects after about 5mins we ended up using our own data the nespresso machine in the room is a nice touch but as we dont drink coffee maybe include hot chocolate pods in future too location the location of the hotel could not be better youre next door to london eye aquarium shreks adventure loads of restaurants;4
my husband and i stayed here in october 2013 for 4 nights this hotel was recommended by my sister who stayed 2 years previously we wanted a nice clean hotel especially as la hotels are generally quite expensive this hotel surprised us it was bigger than expected and clean stairwell was ok but we mostly used the elevators the room was a good size with good toiletries including shower cap and mouth wash teacoffee fridge microwave and free buffet breakfast which was very good fresh omelettes waffles eggs sausages very yummy pastries fruit and cereal were all part of the choices to be had we were impressed and elvira the chef was very friendly most hotels give small tea cups for breakfast so it was nice to have a proper sized mug for my tea for a change;4
i stayed here with my best girlfriend in early july for a week and we felt like this place really offered what it stated the hotel offers a complimentary buffet breakfast to all guests and hands down best omelette ive ever had jose the chef that cooked breakfast various mornings throughout our week stay was both charismatic and excellent at his job cannot commend him enough when we initially checked in it was late in the afternoon and were unfortunately given the ground floor room that was only a short walk from the front desk michael from front reception gave us the option to change rooms the following day as we were there for a week and were given a noisy closetotheroad room we did change the following day and as a result were given a top floor room;4
you can easily spend 250 400 per night for a hotel in nyc if you are traveling solo and dont mind the shared bathroom down the hall the jane is perfect the hotel the bar the rooftop lounge the restaurant the staff and the vibe is great the roomsare well very small and thats ok with me you basically get a small single bed thats sort of like being on an old time steamship the bathrooms down the hall are very clean and they give you a really nice robe and great towels it would be impossible for two people to sleep together in which case they do have larger rooms for 2 in the 250 price range the location is great and the west village is wonderful the staff is very friendly i would stay here again assuming i am traveling solo;4
just checked into the empire with pasquale at the front desk he was so helpful and gracious the taxi i arrived in began rolling forward while i was trying to pull my heavy suitcase from the backseat my shoe was caught by the rolling tire and my right arm was wrenched i limped into the hotel pasquale upgraded my room so that i could check in immediately as i arrived before the 300 check in time the decor of the empire is not to my taste but its location next door to lincoln center and its stellar staff keep me coming back;4
the wyndham is very well located close to penn station and right next to 34th street subway getting around new york from the hotel is very easy just a few blocks away from times square 42nd street and broadway the subway is very easy to negotiate and very reasonably priced 275 for a senior citizen travelling by taxi is very expensive and frustrating traffic is often grid locked and pedestrians ignore traffic signals which adds to the general chaos the subway is the way to go we arrived at the wyndham late at night after an eleven hour train journey from niagara falls we were tired and looking forward to bed we were greeted by a lovely young lady called chrystal who immediately put us at ease and was most welcoming when she learned we were celebrating;4
i booked the hotel through amtrak rewards and got a very good price the hotel itself is classic new york architecture from the 20s 30s great location right across the street from madison square garden in penn station blocks away from empire state building only a few blocks from times square everything in the room work which is most it hasnt 247 diner to tik tok which i use all the time and has two smaller restaurants i want italian in one steak house in the facility which are much more expensive than the tiktok;4
we didnt book this hotel initially we was sent here after the hilton in hollywood was over booked and they didnt have a room for us we was put in the disabled room the room was huge as you would expect as it had to accommodate a wheelchair the room was really clean the beds were really comfortable and there was a nice patio area outside the pool area looked plush and very clean indeed i wouldnt hesitate to book this hotel again its on the doorstep of universal studios so really handy if visiting there we didnt eat breakfast there so cannot comment on that;4
we had a very enjoyable stay at the hollywood hotel at the end of april the hotel was very clean the breakfast lovely with quite a choice and catered for all the beds were super comfy only gripe is that you have to pay for parking but if you can find parking further up the road its free it is in a good location for all the major attractions and as we had a car we had no problem getting around i would also suggest you avoid the comedy night on a wednesday night simply awful im not sure if that is due to the amercianbritish sense of humour being different but car crash springs to mind we enjoyed our stay that much here that we tried to book again for our 2nd leg of la but it was full if i were to visit la again i wouldnt hestitate staying here again;4
always scary booking budget hotels like this as forrest gumps mom said you never know what youre gonna get pleasantly surprised we got a great deal peak summer season 4 nights end of july beginning of august was very wary as the price we got was so low the room was very small just enough for a bed and small hutch for one suitcase a small metal tv stand thought there was no bathroom as we opened the room door but behind the door was the decent bathroom ac worked just enough to keep the room comfortable not quite cool but comfortable enough to sleep bed was a bit hard but okay the first 3 nights of 4 the elevator was broken and we were on the fifth floor which is a bit of a pain after walking most of the day again tolerable it is a small quaint hotel;4
this is part of a continuing series of my impressions and experiences staying at various hotels and resorts while traveling to attend concerts worldwide this review is for the hilton los angeles universal city in universal city california i would recommend this hotel based on my short onenight stay for an event at gibson amphitheatre which is walking distance from the property property hilton los angeles universal city location universal city california address 555 universal hollywood dr los angeles ca 916081001 phone 855 2713621 website wwwhiltoncom room typeclass 1 king bed date december 45 2012 booking source direct overall rating 45 note score is totally subjective based on price location and comparison to like properties within same;4
we stayed for 1 night at the end of our us trip before flying home to melbourne we had a smallish room with 2 comfortable queen sized beds the place is fine for one or 2 nights rooms are a little dated if that matters to you we had only booked the room not the breakfast buffet but the fabulous man on the front desk took pity on us and gave us complimentary breakfast the breakfast was great plenty of choice and we filled up big time right next door to universal studios we just walked up but theres a shuttle service if youre not into steep hills only real negative a fee for wifi for each device would definitely recommend if you are going to universal studios;4
i had a single room with a shared bathroom for 4 nights between christmas and new year the room was tiny but had under bed storage for my suitcase and the bed was comfortable the room was invariably hot and the fan was noisy so i ended up sleeping with the window slightly open the bathroom was always clean and i never had to wait to use the facilities the staff were friendly and i was able to store my suitcase before my evening flight very short walk to the subway and the start end of the highline walk not a bad walk down to ground zero or up to time square would recommend for a short stay or somebody on a budget with so much to see and do you only really need a bed and bathroom;4
perfect location very close to subway stations and penn station walking distance to empire state building and several other sites the rooms are small but the value for money is very good several good restaurants close by and 1015 min walking from times square;4
on sep 2019 my husband my kid and i stayed for a night at the hilton los angelesuniversal city was a very good overall experience big hotel nice pool area location the hotel is walking distance to universal studios which is why we were there we parked at the hotel and walked to universal they have a shuttle but we didnât use it rooms our room 2065 was large with two full beds views we had a view to universal overlooking hogwarts illumination the room itâs very well illuminated lots of lamps and spots just how i like it beds very good mattress i slept very well noise no noise cleanliness it was clean service the staff is respectful but could be more friendly wi fi fast swimming pool big pool very nice lawn with chairs;4
perfect location close to the empire state buildingtime squaremacysand numerous restaurants and bars the hotel itself is a little bit tired but my room was very clean and comfortable the hotel staff were very polite and helpfull the restaurant food was excellent along with the breakfast bar;4
just back from a 4 night stay here the location is great just across the street from the lincoln centre one block from columbus and central park and the subway a 2 minute walk from the entrance the lobby is sumptuous with a nice cosy bar good music and a relaxed vibe in the evenings check in straightforward and a very helpful concierge we found the front desk manager gunita to be particularly helpful and nothing was too much trouble for her thank you the room was nice lovely big comfortable king sized bed a nice shower and a big screen lcd tv some of the furniture was looking a little tired but overall very happy the view from the room of the lincoln centre was just great wifi in the room cost 13 a day but was free in the lobby and bar areas overall a very;4
rooms are simple nothing complexas i never watch tv it wa refreshing to have rooms without tv rooms are clean and shower is ok fridge freezer in every room but found it a bit noisy so first thing i do is switch it off great6 if you are spending a longer period of time as there is a shared kitchen hotel is close to big supermarket tesco and many venues and access very easy by public transport;4
overall i had a great experience at hotel empire for over a week while in town for business rooms were fine and customer service is obviously emphasized by the staff there one asst manager in particular zuli went above and beyond to help with a computer and printer problem she had a smile on her face the entire time and we finally resolved the issue great hotel great staff great location good food at pj clarkes and eds chowder house too;4
we stayed here for five days while we were visiting hollywood we didnt want to stay at an expensive place where there was a lot of traffic to fight but wanted a nice clean hotel dont let the outside of this hotel fool you as you pull off the street to the front checkin for some reason the picture above of the pretty front is in the back of the hotel where the parking lot and pool are we made the mistake of looking for what was in that picture instead of paying attention to the numbers so we drove right by the hotel a couple of times without knowing it our stay had a great buffet breakfast included with the price the eggs were cooked to order right in front of you along with fresh waffles i felt safe here in this area and walked a lot during the daylight hours;4
reserved this hotel for one night visit to hollywood price is decent and rooms were clean most importantly the stay was quiet and peaceful in a potentially âhappeningâ area the drawbacks if you ask for a foldup sofa for your kids prepare to pay 30 also prepare to pay almost 20 for parking which i think is a âripoffâ staff is kind of friendly and helpful breakfast is a plus for âbreakfast eatersâ location is definitely strategic if you are visiting hollywood area oh and if you are there in a âlowâ car watch yourself as you are driving into the entrance area to check in it is a bit steep oh no bathtubs either so for you ladies that want to take a bath forget it fridge and microwave were a plus;4
stayed here for a couple of nights when starting our trip up the west coast easy access to universal on their shuttle bus ten minute walk to train station for easy access to other areas hotel rooms comfortable free wi fi in the foyet i would recommend this hotel;4
i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for a business trip the location was very convenient to hollywood which is where our meetings were checkin was a breeze at the hilton honors counter the attendant even walked us to the elevator when i got up to my room the door was ajar i realized that it did not close easily and had to actually be pulled shut nothing was amiss in the room and i did not complain about it i did make sure i closed the door tightly throughout my stay and locked it when in the room i had no problems the room king sized on 19th floor was spacious while the decor was modern including flat screen tv it did show some wear a metal fitting in the bathtub was loose and the carpet was clear worn at the room entry however it was clean and everything;4
we picked the new hyatt lax as we needed a place convenient to lax on a recent trip to see the us womens national soccer team at the rose bowl the hotel is new and the closest to lax terminal 1 510 min walkable but also has frequent shuttles which could actually take longer depending on traffic in lax and around century boulevard as a hyatt passport member i found a good rate online i checked in online so check in was fast and efficient we were given a room on the top floor 12 very clean sound proof windows and comfortable beds bathroom was also clean with shower only and hairdryer provided there were usb chargers and a modern flat screen tv there is a coffee maker with starbucks coffee too we had a good night sleep the first night without any air or road;4
from my first interaction with the jane 6 months before my trip i was very impressed the staff were happy for me to have a parcel delivered to the front desk and when i arrived i felt welcome especially as a solo female traveller in a new country i loved the bellhop uniform of the staff and the oldfashioned style of the walkways and lift i didnt love the fact there was only one lift but its an old building the rooms are small yes but you cannot claim to be surprised by this as its made blatantly clear on the website they were impeccably clean and the hotel provide bottles of water one in the room on arrival and more when requested dressing gowns and slippers which i wasnt expecting i didnt have air con but i hate air con anyway and was relieved that i had;4
my recommendations are make sure they have changed the sheets on bed before you sleep even on your first day there other than that it is all fine it is not a fancy hotel and it is not worthy more than 85 a night sometimes they even try to charge 133 dont pay all that or you ll be frustrated the subway is one block away so you can go anywhere fast there is a restaurant two blocks away called famiglia they have the best pizza and best ever lasagna it is clean safe you get what you pay for i stayed there for a week;4
this hotel is not retro it is the original near a metro station with a bus stop right in front it is convenient to universal studios and los feliz a trendy art district where film crews are frequently seen an air of fifties hollywood glamor remains in the details of this hotel stylized metal palm leaves granite floors reminiscent of the hollywood stars at graumans chinese theatre interior balconies open to the stars and rooms updated with modern amenities and a comfortable bed made this hotel stay an unexpected pleasure the attractive landscaped pool area is a welcome place to cool off and relax the breakfast was plentiful including a waffle table with lots of juice and coffee i appreciated the ceramic mugs in both the room and at breakfast instead of foam;4
we stayed here for 5 nights during our trip to la when we first arrived i was a bit disappointed as the hotel seemed in the middle of nowhere but once we got our bearings it was easy to get to everywhere from this hotel there are two subway stations close by where you can get to all the main locations in la we had a car and from the hotel we were within quick driving distance of everything i would especially recommend this hotel if you have a car although the car park is a bit steep but is secure the room was lovely and modern and had everything you could need the breakfast we only had once wasnt very appetising and i felt a bit ill after hence why we ate elsewhere if you have a car there are tons of restaurants within a 5 minute drive of the hotel also 15;4
having done my research and reading other reviews i knew what to expect this is a typical new york hotel with tiny rooms but no smaller than other new york hotels that i have stayed in the rooms are small and stuffy in the summer the air conditioning is noisy but effective and the corridors can be a bit of a maze however this was a reasonably priced base for a few days and i was not in the room very long the staff were excellent and friendly communication from jamie ahead of my arrival was quick helpful and informative the room and communal amenities were clean and well maintained and not too busy considering the hotel was fully booked the saturday night was a little noisy from the onsite club but this was to be expected greenwich village was lovely and there;4
lax in general sucks even without all the construction i hope i never have to fly inout of it again now thw hotel is a different story what an awesome place lobby a the way to the room was exceptional;4
i was worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor but i was pleasantly surprised the reception and lobby are nicely decorated and i found the staff to be friendly and helpful i booked a junior suite as it didnt cost much more than a double room and i was very glad i did the room was very spacious with a sofa and coffee table desk and dining area kitchen with microwave coffee maker and fridge walk in wardrobe and a large double bed which was very comfortable the room was very clean with plenty of towels complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom housekeeping were excellent and when the do not disturb sign was used we were not bothered they would always come back later in the day we took our laptop as the room;4
the staff are very friendly especially linda she greets you with her smile and goes above and beyond to help you out the lobby is huge and the atmosphere at the hotel makes you feel comfortable because there are always people checking in and out of the hotel the building is historical and the location is close to everything;4
we love staying at the empire because 1 its location directly across the street from the lincoln center 2 lots of surrounding restaurants and delis and coffee 3 the room was very clean and bed which is extremely important was clean and and does not feel like a 1000 people have slept there the bathroom was a bit dated but clean and functional that was the only reason i did not give the facility 5 stars the hotel does have a fabulous roof top view bar pool rare find in nyc so in summary we have stayed at this hotel twice and have enjoyed both visits and would book again;4
two of us stayed here in a superior double room enough space for two large cases and all our stuff queensize beds clean and very comfy had a great sleep every night roof top bar is good for a snack and a cocktail and to take in the wonderful manhattan skyline very handy for the subway lincoln centre century 21 and central park save your breakfast money and walk past starbucks to duane reed and get a decent coffee and breakfast for a quarter of the price the concierge at the hotel desk is brilliant if you have any questions about what to do and where to go he knows everything;4
after the shock of ny hotel prices in may graduation wore off i would say that this hotel was a bargain excellent service professional staff and very modern clean and comfortable rooms the cozy bed and nespresso machine in the room were lovely an unexpected treat was the history of this building nicola tesla lived here and many famous people have spent time at this ny landmark watch for plaques around this building and others to learn more about the history of ny and yes you hear the sirens and traffic but its new york bring ear plugs;4
i stayed for three nights at the jane on a recent business trip on these types of trips i have the choice of staying at a large and well known chain hotel usually recommended by my work or of finding something myself i usually try to find a hotel with some character that actually reflects the city i am staying in i cant see the attraction of staying in a place with a formula that is repeated ad nauseum throughout the world i am so glad i chose the jane the location is excellent near the water in a neighbourhood with lots of good places to eat and things to do like the spectacular new whitney museum and the high line sky walk which begins at the whitney i loved my room which was furnished with real style the bathroom with its enormous and deep bath and great 1920s;4
renovated and very nice and modern hotel near la airportstaff was friendly and nicerooms were very well appointed and modern color and decornice restaurant with good foodcould improve service and choices of vegetarian food;4
this is a charming boutique hotel in the heart of manhattan they upgraded me to a much larger room with two beds and i actually had room to walk between the beds and the mini fridge by the way unless you are independently wealthy or on a hefty expense account dont even think about taking anything from that mini fridge or snack tray the 8oz diet coke is 750 and the individual size bag of chips is 450 i went to the little grocery store a block down the street and got cans of diet coke for a dollar having said all of that it is very well located within walking distance to many of the most important attractions including broadway the staff was very friendly and efficient there is no ice machine or vending ice has to be sent up from room service which;4
i stayed here during a recent business trip to new york city the hotel is located in a great location it is right next to madison square garden and the empire state building is located nearby the hotel lobby was well laid out and you had to present your room key to security before you could get to the elevators the elevators ran quickly and there was very little wait time on them my room was good enough for my four night stay the bathroom in my room could use a little updating overall it was a very good stay;4
we came to nyc for a party and decided to stay over we loved the hotel the room was clean and nicely decorated more spacious than i expected in nyc i loved the rainfall shower the beds were comfy the hvac could use updating its a bit noisy and the controls controls were a bit tricky it would have been nice to be able to crack a window some suggestions for improvements 1 add charging station 2 add some complimentary bottled water 3 the fridge was jam packed with honor bar items you could leave a little room for whatever the guest might bring its not like the number of people that could occupy that room would ever drink that much liquor anyway;4
2nd visit to empire perfect location for cp room good although a little tired pool open seasonal months watch out i went in mid september and couldnât use it very disappointing overall for a the location value is good and rooftop bar lounge very appealing would recommend;4
jose was great i told him we were staying at the hotel for our anniversary and asked if there were any rooms with a view at first he checked quickly and couldnt find anything however he took the time to look further and called us in our room to say that he was actually able to find a view after all;4
i just recently stayed again at the newyorker for the most part i love this hotel i always prefer an older hotel that has aged with character over time thats the newyorker its probably just about a hundred years old and while updated it still shows signs of the past its old sign is visible in the nyc skyline as you enter the city but when you go into the lobby you see a classy interior that shimmers and shines the main elevator area has 12 elevators with some for the first 20 floors and others for the rest theres never a long wait for the elevator this area is always monitored by staff checking that you have a room key a nice touch of security the lobby is enormous and has tables with electrical outlets lots of comfortable seats and couches around coffee;4
hi days inn is one of the best value for the money i know in nyc for whom upper west side is an acceptable location and does not look for a fancy place this hotel is a good compromise it is a bit old and the internet in the room does not always work but the rooms are relatively quiet and large and the price is very attractive also the staff is very helpful especially melissa at teh front desk;4
gorgeous hotel really helpful staff our room had a lovely view but was really small we didnt complain cause we were only there for 3 days and were out sight seeing most of the time there was no coffee maker in room but downstairs sells lovely coffee and the diner does really lovely breakfast;4
i stayed in the large captains room and it was spacious and lovely the bed was very comfortable and i slept very well the french restaurant attached to the lobby has amazing food and seems to be a destination spot for the locals so after a great night sleep and a perfect cappuccino with a square of chocolate i crumbled on top again at the restaurant i rented one of janes bikes 10 dollars and road the streets of greenwich village and up and down the park path along the hudson finally the staff was authentically friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy working at the jane;4
spent a week here there were a few teething problems but nothing luis couldnt fix location and price cant be beat great views and a great rooftop bar would stay here again 24hr star bucks and chemist underneath great food nearby 1 block to central park;4
the new yorker is a very nice hotel in a great location and is perfect for a trip to nyc it does not have much in the way of restaurants or bars but the neighborhood more than compensates for those defficencies;4
this hotel fits the bill for an easy efficient stay in hollywood literally across the street from universal studios an easy walk or free shuttle ride the hilton offers convenience and comfort the rooms and beds were comfortable and clean the bathrooms were spacious the views were lovely free breakfast is included with hilton honors elite status which felt like excellent value selfparking in the garage cost 30 and was easily accessible aimee at the front desk was especially friendly and helpful i highly recommend for a universal studios visit;4
staff were friendly and happy to assist expected a bit more than paper cups and plastic cutlery in the room but thats a first world problem rather than anything else facilities were clean and tidy pool was well presented tidy and inviting staff were highlight for the price an ok place to stay;4
this art deco hotel is in a fantastic location in between 34th street and 8th avenue the hotel is lovely and our room on the 31st floor was spacious and the bathroom clean and fresh but what we loved about our room was it had an amazing view of the empire state building further down 34th street also close by is macys amazing at christmas we had breakfast on a couple of occasions at the tick rock diner in the hotel which was very good but does get busy we also used the hotel bar which had a good selection of drinks and whisky and not too expensive if i get the chance to return to nyc i will probably stay here again;4
the hotel is in a perfect location on 8th avenue with roughly a 10 min walk to times square and the empire state building the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful during our stay nothing seemed too much trouble the hotel is slightly outdated and in need of modernisation however it was clean and tidy so we couldnât complain;4
we stayed here the night before flying home from lax location was good for universal city walk but im not sure how far it would be from the usual sites you go to see whilst in la room was nice terrible view though highwayfreeway the night we stayed we took the 10 minute walk over citywalk and ate at the hardrock cafe it was easy to get to from the hotel upon check out we used the free internet pc they had in reception to do online checkin this was a good idea for guests;4
just spent 4 nights at this hotel first impressions very positive with an attractive reception and bar area and very welcoming staff we were told on check in that we had been upgraded to a king room which was good to hear the room itself though was quite small but i guess thats probably in line with most city hotels but did make us pleased wed got the upgrade disappointingly though the room was very very dark overlooking what looked like an apartment block so definitely no view to speak of however we were there to explore so only really used the hotel as a base we didnt eat in the hotel at all so cant comment on the food or service bar tariff was quite high but again in line with other big cities we have visited though beware the mini bar prices ouch we were;4
nicely situated near lincoln center juilliard school the time warner building columbus circle central park and the plaza hotel all the places i needed to visit on this trip also not far from studio 54 theater to see kisss me kate and the tkts booth at lincoln center it was too convenient;4
took the train in from virginia to penn station and brought 6 friends with me to nyc for the weekend the new yorker was perfect to walk to after a long train ride and easy to get to right down the road checked in a little long and some errors but they made up for it and then headed for the metro to yankee stadium everything we wanted to do was easy to get to from here and the location right next to the nypd was an added bonus the hotel was a little older and rooms were not very big but it was clean and amenities were average for the price in nyc it was perfect the diner attached to the hotel was great and there was pizza fast food and starbucks right across the street never waited too long for a elevator and security was tight but friendly and welcoming the;4
i was traveling alone this trip to nyc and wanted to find something affordable clean and safe while there are some options in the affordable category there the clean andor safe were sometimes questionable i discovered the jane on some website and upon reading all the glowing reviews and checking out the site it seemed perfect and it was the hotel is in a lovely neighborhood treelined and quiet just across from the hudson the subway was a good 58 min walk not too shabby although some days after walking all day in the sweltering heat i wished it had been a couple blocks closer the building is stunning beautifully restored with a number of period details there is a little french cafe on the main floor the room was tiny do not be alarmed though it is;4
overall a positive experience we booked through priceline so decent deal for the two rooms we booked my parents got a renovated room onn the third floor decent middle of the road decor comfortable bedding and linens not very trendy but clean and new my husband and i were first given a nonrenovated room that was unacceptable saggy bed filthy stained carpet and literally piles of dust near radiator bases spoke to the front desk manager and room was swapped for renovated room on 12th floor ultra modern room design platform bed with led lights underneath for mood lighting minimal furniture but doable small but nice bathroom and very clean best proximity to the red line subway literally on the corner of the intersection of 94th and broadway about 40;4
for its price itâs probably the best place in ny couplesgroups of friends mainly cool roof bar amazing basement ballroom bar that gets heaving shared bathrooms are really nice comfy beds air con good front of house only issues door key didnât work every day the hotel wanted a 1000 safety deposit before we checked in which we werenât warned about which we said we didnât have and they said itâs fine eventually;4
if youre in la for a short trip and you want to do universal studios this is the perfect stop comfortable and clean rooms friendly staff the trademark hilton breakfast buffet perfect for starting off the long touristy days not only does a free shuttle run every fifteen minutes to universal but the metro station is less than ten minutes away on foot and connects you to the center of all the fun places the beach is at quite a distance from the hotel though so unless you have a car youll need to keep track of the public transport system to return to the hotel we missed the last bus on the weekend and got stranded for a while hilton has never disappointed us and the streak just continues;4
this is a wonderful hotel i am a new yorker and i stay here when i make my trips home several times a year it is close to the subway and a quick ride to downtown 59th street times square and 34th street are all within fifteen minutes on the subway they offer great rates for a nicely renovated very clean and comfortable stay in new york i recommend them to everyone who is not looking for a restaurant or gym on location the service is good and the staff is very friendly and accommodating;4
excellent location in walking distance to times square major theaters restaurants courteous staff yummy diner italian restaurant attached to lobby free wifi pretty cheap less that 200 for a last minute friday night stayover clean quiet subway bus stop right outside lobby door felt safe even at night and i was a woman alone the 1930s40s art deco retro dã©cor made me feel sophisticated and wealthy lol i loved my stay;4
after reading a number of bad reviews about this hotel we were a little dubious about staying here but all those reveiws were nothing like what we got we arrived five hours early and still able to check into our room straight away everything was clean and the room was lovely provided with a fridge wihich helped to store drinks as well as a microwave and tea and coffee facilities the hotel is in a great location altough there isnt much around the actual hotel except for a few food places such as subway pizza hut etc the metro station is less then a 5 minute walk and we used this with ease everyday for only 5 for an unlimited day pass on the trains and buses also an internet cafe across the street for only 3 an hour i woudnt say the area is dangerous always felt;4
very close to universal studio it just takes about 510 minutes by walk room condition was good and the reception was kind and helpful one thing that was inconvenient was they charged me for a movie which i didnt watch i didnt even turn on the tv in my room so i called next day explained about it and got refund i dont think they did it intentionally but be sure to check your bill;4
linda at the front desk is exactly what you need when you first arrive there is some construction but not an issue clean room good shower pressure comfortable bed and quiet cant ask for anything more 8 minute walk to universal studios sometimes there are too many people to fit on the shuttle so might as well walk anyway;4
ive stayed at the jane twice in the last two years each for 45 nights i have found the accommodations to be very clean comfortable and the staff to be very friendly the single rooms are amusingly tiny but reallywho goes to nyc to spend time at a hotel the flat screen tv and ipod doc are nice touches for winding down at the end of the night the location is fantastic and its a stones throw from the 14th street subway stop the high line and the village and points beyond its become a bit of a home away from home when im in new york if you get a chance enjoy breakfast at the cafe down below the avocado toast is divine;4
if you get a good room its nice the pool is more akin to a bath in size than a real pool we were given a poor room initially but were quickly transferred to a good room when i requested good location rooms dont provide much facility to hang clothes;4
this hotel is superbly situated between downtown and uptown 2 blocks from the empire state the rooms are basic however they are comfortable as are the beds the staff are friendly and there is s very nice restaurant attached to it theres also a diner that serves a nice breakfast;4
we purchased our room on hotwire and did not notice any decline in customer service as many claim happens when making reservations through a third party site we arrived very early in the morning to check our bags and were subsequently upgraded to a king superior room we cant comment on the size of the regular rooms but our room was clean comfortable and attractively outfitted with a great view of lincoln center pool deck was nice for an afternoon nap drinks were overpriced even for nyc the bathroom as others have noted is poorly designed while the pressure in the shower was excellent the water went everywhere without a full shower door there is not adequate storage for even a modest packer while attractive and modern the sink is miniscule didnt drain;4
hotel is facing madison square garden and only a few minutes walk to times square and empire state building in either direction our room was indeed in an old part of the hotel and resembled what it is a hotel with heritagei loved seeing the old pictures of the hotel hanging in the lower lobby even though the corridors and doors looked akin to 1950s the furnishings are the opposite such beautiful comfortable beds and amazing power in the shower seriously refreshing after a day in new york city staff were all very pleasant and helpful the location of the diner attached to hotel was brilliant great for the big breakfast again staff here were great also the coffee dock in the lobby is very handy for anyone who wants a lighter breakfast would recommend this hotel and;4
stayed here for the tribeca film festival and cant complaint great price great location for the price you can rent a crappy hostel with shared bathroom here for less than 100 a night we had our spotless and big bathroom we even got an upgrade on our bed i dont understand people nyc didnt get the name the city that never sleeps for nothing if you rent any hotel in nyc to stay indoors is a waste of money all you need is a place to lay your head after enjoying this great city my experience on this hotel was super big bed big bathroom clean great location subway on the corner less than 60 steps great service and the staff is really helpful and nice free internet on the lobby what else can you ask for totally recommend it;4
we enjoyed our stay at the hollywood hotel the staff was friendly and helpful the room clean and comfortable breakfast was wonderful located close to the metro and and bus line we were able to get where ever we wanted to be would certainly recommend;4
great location right at times square stayed for a work visit room was alittle small but was clean rating would be higher if it wasnât for a difficult to use heating system that reached 90 degrees overall good visit;4
we really enjoyed staying at ameritania at times square our room was small but beautifully decorated and the bathroom had a fantastic shower the doormanvalet jeff was especially friendly and helpful he saved us many by advising us on how to navigate the subway;4
me and my friend stayed stayed here on our first trip to new york it seems to be the most popular in the travel agents new york forums amongst many different travellers we got the train and off at pennyslvania station itâs right across the road so easy access and a short walk with your cases if you donât fancy the taxi fair to and from the airport check in was very quick we were informed prior to this that there are hotel taxes to be made which accumulated to 90 for our 4 night stay between us although they do charge 150 off a card on file until you check out incase you use any of the amenienties not sure what as there isnât a fridge or mini bar in the room maybe just room service the 150 did get refunded back into my card and we paid the 90 cash upon check out;4
we stayed for three nights had a king bed that overlooked the park staff was really nice and always helpful definetly a backpackers hotel right by the 103st metro stop room was small but clean with a nice updated bathroom overall good if you plan on being out and about most of your trip the only negatives were that there is only one elevator that went out once while we were there and the bed was really hard and we like a more firm mattress;4
avery large room for a hotel in nyc mattress needs to be updated and more lighting in room but overall this is a great place to stay very conveniently located 5 min was to central park 10 min walk to 30 rock and 7 min walk to heart of times square staff was extremely helpful;4
stayed here with my wife for 4 nights and chose this hotel primarily because it was close proximity to where we needed to be for a funeral and get togethers that were in this area weve stayed in many nyc hotels over the years and have learned that most nyc hotels tend to have small rooms older decor and big price tags hotel empire was no exception first the pros location location location ideally situated for much more than the purpose of our visit its literally right across the street from lincoln center and just 1 block from central park we loved the location we had beautiful city street views from our room cleanliness very good our maid worked hard and was very accomodating whenever we needed extra towels or anything bed comfortable and again clean;4
i have a large yellow lab and they were able to accommodate very well the room was big and had a balcony the only bad thing was my balcony was attached to another rooms balcony with no physical barrier between us hugo who is the chef in the kitchen was very helpful and nice the room was clean and the bed was big but bouncy i moved and my wife felt it only one elevator was working it had a nice laundry room and the amenities for the price is reasonable now the only thing i dont like are the california fees that the hotels add on to the price the food and the service was great so over all i would stay there again;4
the hotel is beautiful but rooms are small which is typical for new york city the bathroom shower was poorly designed with only a one half glass door and a rain shower in the middle there was no way to not flood the floor with water with every shower youll use an extra towel or two to dry the floor we left a message with laundry to requesting my tuxedo be pressed laundry never called back and did not pick up the jacket we left a message at the front desk with a question about the restaurant they didnt call back we requested our room be cleaned as we needed more towels left the room at 900am returned at 400pm the room was untouched the lobby and lobby bar are well appointed the front desk staff bellman and door men were all very polite central park is;4
i really like staying here when in manhattan the rooms are not plush but the prices are good breakfast is very reasonable eds chowder house is very nice and pj clarkes is in the same building cross broadway and go north on columbus for more cafes than you could ever visit cross the other way for lincoln center the bar on the roof offers wonderful ambiance and views staff is professional and just right not obsequious pasquale does good work and so does the concierge no coffee in the room but starbucks is also in the same building its easy to stay here and for nyc the price is quite fair;4
this location is at 72nd and broadway right around the corner is the subway stop so it is extremely convenient and one of the reasons why we picked this place the room was larger than we had thought based on previous reviews adequate space for a double bed small couch not the most comfortable foldout bed but it worked and a small kitchen with a counter the closet was roomy and nearly a walkin and the bathroom was small but clean there was a normal sized shower small sink no counter space unfortunately and a toilet the basics essentially the room had a large tv and a small dining table with two chairs as well as an ottoman the view we had on the 6th floor was of the building across the street we were woken up most of the days by 730 because of a garbage;4
our family of three stayed here for 3 nights ina room with 2 double beds and we were happy with the accommodation the room was nicely furnished with a desk chair settee tv fridge and coffee maker the bathroom is very small but clean we appreciated the friendly but vigilant security folks at the elevators who request that you show your room key to gain entry beautiful foyer and adjacent tick tock diner for meals 24 hours located one block from madison square gardens and penn station which is very convenient if you fly into newark and taken the train into new york city walkable location for times square and chelsea market our stay was part of a porter escapes package and we recommend that you check with your service provider to determine if additional service charges;4
art deco style hotel lobby really nice but when we got out of the lift my first thoughts were where have we come it looked so dated and carpets needed renewing the room was really small with a narrow cupboard with 4 coat hangers in for clothes the positive side is that the bed was extremely comfy along with the pillows so we had excellent nights sleep which helped location is brilliant near madison square gardens and not too far from times square;4
room was fine smallish but clean quiet and comfortable the staff was competent and helpful i loved the location but i have never stayed in a hotel where i had to wait and wait and wait for elevators it seems like such a trivial thing until you are out in hall waiting again for 10 minutes if i stay again i will request a room on the first or second floor to avoid the hassle;4
the staff was really friendly daniel the bell man remembered our name the entire stay the room was clean and the hotel is very close to universal studios shuttle is very helpful although it does not start until after the park opens but this is run by universal not the hotel everyone from the sheraton and the hilton walked to the park if they wanted to get there at opening would definitely stay at the hilton next time pool was clean and nice;4
there was only 1 door so anytime you showered the floor was soaking wet the rooms were also quite dusty and i question how clean the rooms get the front door staff was amazing and incredibly helpful the hotel itself has a great location a starbucks located just a few feet away;4
we had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the small dante park on 63rd st we could see lincoln center from the window there were several great restaurants close by on broadway and subway stops were only 2blocks away easy to get to any area you choose lots of traffic sound and sirens but hey its new york get over it bathroom was small but plenty of shelving for necessities we had a rain shower head that was nice but the drain really needs fixing as you were always standing in water by the time you finished and it took a long time to drain this was our only complaint front desk staff was extraordinarily polite especially maria we will book again;4
this hotel is the best for tourists it is within a walking distance to a few attractions inlcuding macys as i love my shopping the breakfast area has a beautiful view of the city you can see the statue of liberty from there;4
i need to say that it was a very good experience but they should not charge me extra money for water it is very convenient for traveler who has a rush hour on flight because its close to airport however it is far from the place you want to go but if you have a car it will not be a problem;4
this is the second time in the last few months i have stayed at the new yorker hotel the first time on my own the rooms do the job as expected in new york theyre small but space is limited the decor feels a little aged and like a refurbishment wouldnt hurt them but theres nothing wrong with it the rooms are all clean and the beds comfortable the water pressure left a little to be desired and the fixed shower head could be a problem for taller people the location is amazing close to pennsylvania station to be able to get anywhere also along 34th street you have lots of great shops youre a short walk away from times square and all the broadway shows unfortunately on this trip i ordered the romance package and received the chocolates when i went and asked why it;4
we came into the city to see a concert at msg we wanted a good hotel that was close to the garden we could not have been happier the concierge was friendly and checked us in we stayed on the 27th floor with a view of the city line and river our room was just what we needed for our type of stay 1 night although the hotel in general is very busy our room was quiet and we had a great nights sleep the bed was comfortable and the ac kept the room a perfect temp yes it was a little pricey for 1 night but you are paying for convenience and location so if you are okay with that it is worth the stay and we will book again for any future events at msg;4
think grand budapest hotel with a touch of barton fink and youve pretty much got the jane this is a great place to stay for considerably less money than most other places in the neighbourhood the downstairs bar is a sight to behold and cafe gitaine serves decent food at reasonable prices i had a captains room with private bathroom the tub alone is the size of most ny bathrooms as a friend stayed here too i know some rooms are larger than mine but it was good enough yes its livelytonoisy some nights and there is road noise but this is new york the only problem i experienced in six nights and the only reason ive not scored this a five was the very quirky room temperature controls which meant the room was too warm most of the time and sometimes very hot whats;4
i must admit i was really worried about going to the days hotel broadway when i read the reviews on this site however i was plesantly surprised upon arrival when we checked in the hotel staff were all really friendly they even upgraded us free of charge to a king size bed the room was a good size it looked as though it had just been refurbished as the carpets looked new the place was spotless and there was not one nasty creepy crawly in site our room looked right on to broadway which was good as i liked to look out the window alot for the money that we paid for this holiday we were absolutely delighted with it we used the subways alot there is a subway station just across the road i would recommend that you purchase an all day hopper pass for just;4
recommended for the terrific location this hotel does have small rooms older small elevators and no business center but it does have friendly and competent staff its clean and best of all its less than a block from a 123 subway station since there was no business center i was able to get my boarding passes printed at the front desk by emailing a pdf to the hotel we enjoyed breakfast and lunch at the manhattan cafe around the corner on broadway the subway station goes direct to times square and is 1 subway transfer from yankees stadium the 1 train also takes you to the west 116th street station columbia university to catch the m60 sbs bus to laguardia we each got a 7day subway pass and were able to use it to print a transfer for the m60;4
stayed here for a week in october 2011 very cheap price compared to other hotels in the hollywood area and although the neighbourhood is slightly dodgy its not that bad just dont walk anywhere alone the hotel itself is great staff very friendly and helpful michael on reception was full of great ideas on where to eat and what to see we stayed in a suite there which looked onto the courtyard and as mentioned by other reviewers the balcony is shared by a few rooms parking is secure and there is an 18 charge daily which is decent considering all the hotels in the area charge the pool area was new and kept well but unfortunately its not heated so was quite cold breakfast was included with the room and there was a good spread sausages eggs wafflesfresh cereals;4
this is the great place to stay in new york my room are smoking room and best area not noisy and only few stop to times suare madison and attractive place will stay again if came to ny bed are comfy rooms standard clean and we only used for sleep all the activities are out ice machine located on certain floor check in lady was nice and polite had pizza store in front of the hotel bathroom not that nice but clean enough for me overall is a great budget hotel for me;4
i have stayed here before i am claustrophobic and most nyc hotel rooms are very small but i am always quite comfortable here great location and helpful staff always my first choice when i need to come to nyc for travel;4
very good hotel close to times square and broadway hotel rooms were large and very clean excellent value for money buffet breakfast is available at the hotel for 18 per person we bought a bottle of wine at the bar and put it on the room bill they charged 40 so i would suggest buying at a local store and storing in the mini bar in the room if you fancy a drink;4
i have just returned from my trip to ny and i have got to say that i enjoyed myself at morningside inn the service there was very good i was greated with professionalism by the front desk staff they made me feel comfortable and glad that i picked that inn to stay at all my question were answered especially when i asked about places to visit which made it easy for me to get around and enjoy some sites the rooms were very comfortable and private if ever in ny again i would gladly go there once again for my stay;4
just got back from 5 days in nyc my teenage son and i stayed at the empire the best thing about it is the location it is right across from lincoln center close to columbus circle and the central park and a subway ride to everything else the rooms are small and the bathrooms even smaller but not unusual for new york the funny thing about the bathroom is that only half of the shower staff is contained so no matter how hard i tried i soaked the bathroom every time i took a shower i think they will deal with this when they do their planned remodel also the air conditioner in our first room was quite noisy and knocked when the cold air kicked in i found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful we requested an upgrade to two doubles and they gave us one at a modest;4
when we arrived our light did not work however we got a free upgrade to a better room with working lights the service personnel was very nice and forthcoming rooms were cleaned everyday the hotel was located in a safe neighborhood close to the subway and a bus line there were many shops and restaurants nearby it takes a little bit 20 min to go downtown manhattan but since the prices were lower and the public transportation in nyc is convenient this was worth it;4
i was in nyc for the week of easter break with my nephew and we stayed at the jane what a great place the staff was so friendly and accomodating and very helpful with any concerns or questions we stayed in the bunk bed cabin which was really tiny but manageable it might have helped if our suitcases had not been so big the rooms and shared bathrooms were very clean and comfortable other than being small the cafe gitane was a fun place to eat with really good food and menu selection the price was right and the location was perfect other than the fact it is a good 1015 minute walk to the nearest subway station they have bikes to ride free of charge and we took a great ride down to the battery on the hudson river parkway bike path about a 1015 minute ride by bike if;4
tiny space but ok for us rooftop pool is small and inside bar was closed shower had no door and bathroom door is awkward and doesnt fit the space we liked it for a discount price and the location cant be beat overall ok just small and no great room views;4
stayed on the 39th floor and we had a very good view of the manhattan skyline room was dated in terms of ac and tv but nonetheless a comfortable sleep since we were only staying for a night thereâs a cvs pharmacy right beside the hotel and you can even walk to madison square garden and times square under 10 minutes;4
close proximity to lincoln center and central park makes this hotel a premium property columbus circle subway station is close by we had a wonderful time in nyc because of empire hotels location room was comfy and clean but poorly lit staff was helpful for my future ny stay empire hotel will be a top consideration;4
we chose this hotel for its location as we were spending the day at universal studios it is a 5 minute walk the staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable not just with the local area they also gave us some good tips on the next destination in our journey;4
i stay at hilton brand hotels exclusively i am a gold member which in most hilton brand hotels it allows for a complimentary breakfast in the morning i was surprised to be asked to pay for a supposed upgrade to the breakfast so this hotel uncharges you from the supposed executive breakfast so the executive breakfast is basically a little area in the end of the buffet line i stood in the omelet line which i was then asked by the waiter if i wanted to order from that side it was a 10 upgrade i didnt feel like arguing so i said ok the upgrade is actually 1099 not a big deal i just like to be told the right amounts i looked over to the executive breakfast area and i didnt see anything on there but a few yogurts and basic breakfast fruits like i;4
stayed in this hotel on business at the beginning of the year it is a clean and well presented hotel in a prime location the staff are attentive and polite but dont go any further than that there are a couple of issues with the hotel firstly i had a room facing a back street and there was an almighty hum from a fan system outside of the window i am not sure how many floors would be impacted by this but the noise was very noticeable also in this room the temperature was intense even in january the antiquated air conditioning couldnt cope even at full deafening volume which left me with the choice of not sleeping due to heat or noise once i switched rooms it was a much better experience the hotel has a roof bar but the only times i went up here it was either;4
nice boutique hotel clean room good service the perfect hotel and place to start sightseeing in manhattan for a week itâ´s very good located close to broadway times square central ark and subway;4
i was a little worried about staying here after reading the reviews the location is amazing and a 5 minute walk to the tube although the rooms are small the beds were comfy and cleaned when we asked due to us having 2 big suitcases we asked reception and they let us store them in their cupboard the toilets were spotless the only downside the carpets along the corridor were a little out dated and smelt a bit i ate once for breakfast and it was lovely staff were all very friendly and helpful;4
we visited this hotel in october 2005 and spent 2 night while visiting universal studioscity walk if staying here ask for a corner room they are bigger and have views of the park the restaurant has great breakfast and weekend dinner buffets the hotel offers a shuttle to universal that was very reliable you can walk but there are alot of hills and inclines the bathroom in our room was as bigger than our dining room at home and it was all marble floors and counter tops;4
small queue at check in staff offered us bottled water and sweets while we waited prompt check in with no issues our room was on the 10th floor and a corner room think it was an upgrade from what we booked as well lovely big room massive bathroom some areas of the room were looking a bit tired though stains on the sofa and curtains plenty of wardrobe spacedrawers hairdryer in bathroom was very good a rare thing in a hotel breakfast turned out this was included in our booking although they do complicate things with different levelsprices for breakfast keep it simple guys that way staff and customers find it easier to navigate what they can and can not have be aware there are no warm plates to put your hot food on to only one toasting station for quite a;4
getting to the hotel is the easiest journey ive had on this current multi city tour of the states to save over 100 on taxi fare get the flyaway bus outside the airport to union station then get the metro red route to vermont santa monica station the hotel is 200 yards up the street it has the slightest incline but dont worry if your bags have wheels the internet tv is poor but the hotel offers free wireless access great if you brought your laptop but if you didnt use the internet cafe across the street 3 per hour the room was clean comfortable and the hotel also has a car hire facility breakfasts were great with a huge array of waffles toast cereal coffee juice sausages and scrambled eggs the only thing i found a bit of a challenge is that;4
i really enjoyed staying at this hotel pasquale at the front desk was wonderful the room was great as was the breakfast on the mezzanine door men were so courteous and helped me find the correct direction to go be prepared to pay extra for internet daily charge and coffee in the room because there is a keurig coffee machine just bring your own coffee servings and avoid the 3 dollar a cup charge it was difficult to cool the room down at night even though it was winter however i would definintely stay here again because it was close to everything i wanted to see and do;4
really helpful staff who went out of their way to ensure our stay was the best posible free upgrade to a corner room i would especially like to thank the door staff and said especially who made sure all our travel needs were catered for location was ideal for transport links and broadway would definitely recommend but be aware new york isnât cheap haha;4
the lobby is nice very busy the room was ok but the bathroom needed maintenance old fixtures were ok but walls and tile need work tv picture quality was poor so dont bother nice view of city price was competitive very convenient location to trains walk to times square or hop subway to greenwich village no bad odors hallways nice;4
overall our stay here was pleasant we had a few issues but nothing we couldnt deal with the food in the hotel is very expensive 50 dollars for 2 portions of pancakes seriously the decor of the hotel is lovely we had a junior suite which had plenty of room and was a good room for the 6 nights we stayed overall good might get a few minor bumps along the way but im sure the hotel staff will help you with those even in the 10th floor we had a lot of road noise the windows do very little to keep it out we did sleep but some nights it was a little much;4
close to times square and central park excellent location host jeff was fantastic super helpful and friendly even organized a car to the airport for us ac was a bit loud at night otherwise a fantastic location would definitely stay there again;4
this was my 4th or 5th say and yet again it was good i arrived early about 11am and the man on reception said you have booked a single non ensuite but you can have a double with a bathroom and you can have your room now thats was very nice of him im sure my single room would have been fine coz they have been in the past it is a hostel with some noise in the halls but i would defo stay there again;4
i stayed here for one night with my girlfriend just for a fun getaway the pool and rooftop top was great we checked in before it closed service was great amanda at the front desk was incredibly kind and friendly she gave great recommendations for dinner and even complimented the photo on my drivers license the room was also great would definitely return;4
the hotel is definitely conveniently located near the airport which is also close to some good tourist sites however the wifi is so terribly slow they force you to buy their wifi so donât fall for the free wifi also if you eat in their restaurant itâs extremely expensive for hotel food other than that it is very pleasant clean and convenient;4
this is a great place to stay and very conveniently located there is a subway station right next to the hotel and is walking distance to practically everything including madison square garden times square empire state building the new high line park rockefeller center to name a few and there are plenty of places to eat nearby there is a bakery just down the block called angelinas which is fantastic a cvs next door plus a liquor store mcdonalds and starbucks across the street the tik tok diner in the hotel is a great place to eat the hotel retains its original character and its well worth the time to go downstairs and read all about its history and the people who have stayed there it is a great value we have stayed here twice now once just overnight on our;4
the location of the hotel is very convenient for travel around the city close to the 66th street subway stop and columbus circle stop so a matter of a few blocks from the 123 a c e lines which was one of our reasons for choosing it the lobby is very nicely decorated and looks exactly like the photos i cant comment on the bar service as we did not use it at any point during our week stay there is also a rooftop club again did not use and a poolcabanas which appeared to be closed during our stay it was a shame that we didnt use these amenities i assume from the long lines for the club that it was good we were checked in by a gent called pasqualie apols if spellt incorrectly who was very helpful providing us with complimentary in room wifi for the;4
this is a very good hotel if you are staying for a city break or short holiday we stayed in a family room which was spacious and clean it is very near a subway stop and 30 second walk from a duane reade a sparpharmacycorner shop if you dont like lifts then make sure you walk down to the lobby the lift is small loud and squeeky but a very good cheap stay;4
spent 4 days at the new yorker and found it to be a very pleasant hotel within a great location room size was more than adequate for a hotel in a prime location furthermore the views i had from the room were fantastic undoubtedly i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again;4
stayed here for 3 nights in a twin bedded room one double and one king size bedrooms are large very modern very clean and very comfortable bathroom with bath and over bath shower no heated towel rail or extractor fan though room not cleaned unless requested but didnt bother us staff very friendly polite and professional nothing too much trouble meal deal was very good value â£53 for two of us for two course meal with glass of wine or beer and full breakfast menu lovely food lovely restaurant;4
stayed four nights and would definitely return when next in nyc staff were friendly and helpful including a courtesy call to our room to see if we were satisfied with it after checkin the room was clean and the beds comfortable although it was a busy weekend and the hotels bars popular we were not disturbed ask for a front room with views of the lincoln centre this was an ideal city base from which to explore close to central park shopsetc and subway;4
4 of us had a double double room 2 weeks ago i wasnt expecting the room to be spacious as it is ny after all but it was not as boxroom as i anticipated to be honest we didnt spend much time in the room so it wouldnt matter anyway the location is th best thing about this hotel it is minutes walking distance from most midtown sites and easy access for several subway lines penn station and the path to nj the building itself has a cool history and tries to maintain the art deco vibe but is is a bit tired in places overall i would go back for location and price was better then similarly located hotels nothing about it was offensive it just wasnt amazing however remember you are in nyc you shouldnt spend much time in your room;4
we had two double rooms on the fifth floor the rooms were fairly modern not immaculate but quite adequate best positive is the location its amazingly well placed for central park lincoln centre and the underground at the lincoln columbus circle is only 300 yards and from there a quick walk in any direction takes you to places youll want to see yuri the concierge is excellent a couple of downsides water ran cold once and first two nights hotel was very noisy with younger guests minibar is super expensive and our kids did not realise that the things in the room were not complimentary i didnt realise the travel plug wasnt once the label is peeled off thats it so ended up with a bill i wasnt expecting more my fault than theirs ask about their hotel car to;4
hotel was very convenient to many nyc attractions and penn station restaurant and 24 hr diner famous tick tock diner in hotel staff very friendly and accommodating my one complaint is the size of the room very small compared to most hotels iâve have stayed in might be normal for nyc we had several issues when arrived but were immediately corrected the coffee machine didnât work refrigerator was missing and bathroom faucet loose no view in lower floor room would definitely stay here again;4
spent 4 nights here in february 2020 was hoping for snow but got none very very cold though whilst room was small it had everything we needed and was always kept clean and tidy herself used the hairdryer and found it great i have a bad back and find sleeping in hotel beds a bit of a lottery but the beds in the ameritania were perfect for me not too soft but not hard either shower was amazing rooms were also very quiet we didnt hear anything from outside or neighbouring rooms location was perfect for walking to times square or to central park we never used the subway so cant comment on that we did buy a 48 hour pass for the gray line bus and this was fab we did the four bus tours plus the boat trip and also used the bus to get around new york on to jeff;4
stayed for five days on the 5th floor room 542 after reading about its renovation in new york magazine great location in the west village not far from the now infamous high line park and right on the hudson river new york was super hot that week and i took three showers a day and the shared bathrooms were spotless 95 of the time i loved gazing at the statue of liberty each morning as i brushed my teeth good extras flat screen tv with dvd ipod docks air conditioning great staff rooms and beds very tiny similar to all the small hotels ive stayed in in europe i didnt experience any bugs and had minimal conact with postitutesjohns and odd permnament residents but also met nice european and american guests too hotel is a little haunted its over a;4
thanks to guest service who were so accommodating to us on our first trip to new york rooms were nice and clean need a lilttle upgrade to the furniture hotel staff was awesome in california we receive rewards for being sustainable and not having our room clean daily so we did the same here and things were different we were called daily requesting to clean our room kinda pushy but we figured its a new york thing lol all in all i loved my experience and would def come back;4
art deco style hotel lobby really nice but when we got out of the lift my first thoughts were where have we come it looked so dated and carpets needed renewing the room was really small with a narrow cupboard with 4 coat hangers in for clothes the positive side is that the bed was extremely comfy along with the pillows so we had excellent nights sleep which helped location is brilliant near madison square gardens and not too far from times square;4
really nice hotel could do with tea and coffee in the room for the mornings and the long shopping days staff very friendly and helpful central enough to all the sightseeing and the total bonus a view of the empire state;4
i stayed at this hotel with some friends when visitng the city in april 2010 when we arrived we were greeted by the bell men and helped with our luggage we tried upgrading our room at the desk but were told that no other rooms were available the decor in the lobby was nice and everything was clean our room was small the norm in nyc im told but clean and nicely decorated the beds were comfortable we were able to open the window feel the breeze of the city and see the taxi traffic on the street below the bathroom was extremely small but clean we had to ask for more towels and received them without a problem the location of the hotel is excellent its within walking distance of the subway stations and central park theres a bus stop on the corner of the hotel;4
i stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to nyc with my girlfriend we both liked the hotel a lot and i would not only recommend the empire hotel to friends and family but i would stay here again the location of the hotel is very good just off of columbus circle and very close to the nyc subway and central park midtown manhattan is easily reachable on foot for those who enjoy a nice stroll the hotel is adjacent to the lincoln center so for those who may be coming to town to see a performance there this hotel may be a good fit we booked the hotel on priceline so i cant comment on the price however i believe the prices to be reasonable for the area the staff at the front desk was pleasant and helpful and the lobby appeared clean and welcoming a bar and nice seating;4
my friend and i stayed at the hotel for a couple of days which happened to be the days of the recent snow storm the room was a good size for nyc very clean modern and updated and a great location we booked the hotel at a great price on trip advisor especially compared to other downtown hotels this was a great value it is about in the middle of times square and central park right next to different theaters jeff at the front door was really helpful when we were trying to find transportation to the airport which happened to be cheaper than uber that day i recommend it;4
this was a very good hotel for the price which we found on bookingcom the room was small but clean and adequate we were very surprised however that there was a charge of 3 per serving for coffee brewed in the room i do a lot of traveling for business and pleasure and have never had to pay for coffee that i brewed myself in my room really this was ridiculous;4
this hotel is situated perfectly if you are going to universal its right across the street rooms look like they were recently updated and staff is pleasant pros location recently updated cons elevators do not always work had to constantly call someone and seemed like we rode it up and down each time we entered;4
location located in the middle of nowhere but you get almost anywhere quickly and easily go from there whether by car or by public transport directly in front of the hotel is a bus stop which cover some connections about 300 meters away you will find the underground station and another bus stop from here the express bus depart to beverly hills or santa monica journey time approx 60 min with the subway you can reach for example hollywood universal studios downtown or the staples center in a few minutes long beach also be reached directly with the subway lines by the way a weekly pass costs only 20 with which you can use both bus and subway as often as you like we found the public transport as a good and cheap alternative to the car several fast food;4
this year with some friends i started my vacation there the hotel is very nice and great situated the personal very helpful and gave us great advices about hollywood sts shows and with a pass was just the perfect choice magnificently breakfast and very comfortable beds with some hilton upgrades we became a fantastic room i can only recommend this hotel there was a nice garage and no doubt that in cali you will need a carstrongly i can only recommend it;4
we stayed one night during our recent socal trip we had just come from disneyland and was spending the day at universal studios we arrived fairly early to check in but luckily were able to check in when we arrived and the front desk staff was so friendly and awesome we had a king room overlooking the citywalk and universal studios side and i loved the size and brightness of the room the bed was extremely comfortable and overall the room was great the fitness center was well equipped and had enough weights and a universal machine for me to get a good back workout in the weight room is on the small side though the seafood prime rib buffet was great and our server was one of the best i can remember having anywhere this is a perfect hotel for visiting;4
i stayed at the empire hotel for 10 nights during september 2016 in the corner suite suite was quite large with a living room that included a dining table seating area and a tv the bedroom was separated by french doors and also included a tv which was nice bathroom was clean and comfortable and i enjoyed the walk in shower which had strong water pressure something hard to find in nyc the furniture was dated but clean room view was amazing overlooking lincoln center on one side and broadway street on the other i cant comment on the regular rooms as i havent seen them but understand they are very small so make sure you choose the right room the hotel has a nice and quite lobby which was important to me as i dont like going into a hotel with a tiny lobby what i loved;4
first night in la we stayed at the hollywood hotel just one night because we had to drive to san francisco the next day the hotel is nice and the customer service is great the staff greeted us at the front desk and were very kind and helpful the room itself is ok nothing out of this world looks a bit outdated and could use some tlc but its still in good shape bathroom was clean and comfortable the thing i loved most about this place was the breakfast they had a omelet and waffle station where a staff member would cook your choice of omelet or waffles breakfast was wonderful and for the price paid beats a lot of hotels ive stayed at overall a decent hotel its in a good location and has great breakfast and plenty of parking which you must pay but its la you have to pay;4
although we found our room to be a little on the small size my husband and i found this hotel to be extremely clean and comfortable included in the price was an adequate continental buffet style breakfast which we took advantage of prior to sightseeing each day the hotel we found was ideally located to take in the usual tourist things such as the walk of fame the hollywood sign up in the hills and of course universal studios friendly and courteous reception staff who securely stored our suitcases after we had booked out and in addition we found dimitrius hotels driver and a real gentleman to be knowledgable and obliging downside petty maybe but worth mentioning the use of papercardboard cups in room for the podcapsule coffee machine would so much more prefer;4
i booked this hotel due to its close proximity to universal studios and therefore expected to pay a premium however in comparison to other hotel chains my family has stayed in this one was way behind on uptodate amenities the room was clean but dated the tv was quite old and unlike in some hotels you had no access to services such as netflix the hotel didnt even have free wifi its a must these days everything about the room was oldfashioned and it still had the same decor as when i visited 10 years earlier the staff we encountered at guest services were unfailingly polite and accommodating it also had a free courtesy shuttle to universal studio city which had a plethora of amenities this also meant you werent dependent on paying exorbitant prices for;4
i actually arrived here after the company i booked with had changed my hotel without telling me after the 20 block walk i had a great surprise huge tv ensuite doublebed more importanly everything clean which is always nice agree with some reviews about the staff one or two were v helpfulothers werent so but if youre there to do your own thing is a great location 2 minutes from subway 5 mins from central park times square is walkable too about 3040mins would def stay there again and recommend to others poss room was small but fine for 2 people and if youre in new yok the last thing you should be doing is spending a lot of time in your room overall v good value for money if youre on a budgetyou should def check this place out;4
stayed for 4 nights and cannot grumble about a thinghelpful and courteous staff the receptionists where excellentwe stayed on the 3rd floor and apart from the emergency vehicles didnt hear any outside noiseroom was spacious enough bathroom very goodi wasnt in new york to stay in my hotel but along with been conveniently positioned i have no complaints what so ever;4
room was nice and spacey ac was ok at best after a day at the park and the sun beating on the room a quality ac is essential had it set to 60 and still wasnt that cold bathrooms need an exhaust fan and with 4 people in a room another mirror for the women to get ready is a must have hotel has a great pool and in house barrestaurant city walk which is a five minute walk away has just about everything you could want in the way of fooddrink and shopping;4
what a great place the proximity to universal city and studios was amazing the shuttle was very convenient but mostly we walked its almost an oasis to escape to once we arrived we didnt require our car until checkout the metro rail is just down the road the staff were very helpful and friendly i would recommend this hotel to anyone and i would certainly stay here again;4
what a great location to stay in manhattan the hotel is centrally located and we were able to walk to so many places in the city the staff was spectacular we got a room on wyndam points actually had a suite i would certainly go back there especially because of the location;4
me and my sister stayed at abercorn house for a few days we were really surprised at how nice it was considering how cheap it was our room was simple and small but we had really comfortable beds and everything was clean the shower wasnt the best but it didnt matter the location is really really good you can get zone 2 tube tickets and easily get into london city in about 15 minutes its so easy and hammersmith itself is beautiful too there are plenty options to buy food and drinks the only reason to rate only four stars is because we had some difficulties paying and the walls are very thin so it feels like strangers are literally next to you anyway we loved our stay there and would recommend it to anyone searching for a simple stay close to london city;4
the facility was very nice the staff was excellent especially the doormen the room was very clean the location was perfect the only problem our room was facing the street and the noise was almost unbearable if we stay her again we will request an inside or backside room;4
the hotel itself is in great shape for itâs age nicole at the front counter was externally polite friendly and beyond helpful the rooms are clean and functional the cleaning staff do a great job the complimentary breakfast is great fuel for your day ahead again the staff are very friendly very happy with our time spent here so far kd;4
upon check in we handed over a credit card werent told that they actually hold a pending transaction which tied up our money for the entire trip were very rude about it too if theyd just explained we could have used a different card and had no issues at all rooms were clean and great location otherwise;4
i spent 5 nights at the jane in one of the bunk bed cabins the cabin itself is small with just enough room for a big suitcase against the wall at the end and with two large drawers below the bunk bed to stow clothing and some clothing hooks on a rail against the wall together with two comfortable beds with a television each this is more than i need while travelling friendy staff a small but cozy roof terras nice location at the edge of the west village some road noise from west st with the window open but nothing that bothered me love the atmosphere of the place would visit again;4
after staying in a poor hotel at jfk airport in order to attend a business conference i moved to this hotel in manhattan just west of central park i was pleased with my room it was clean with a comfortable bed and a nice bathroom staff was professional helpful and polite a far cry from the previous hotel subway station at 96th st had direct subway 1 to columbus square times square and theaters good bagel shop and pizza shops at broadway and 97th great value for a great location id stay there again without hesitation my room was small and just right for me if you want to use wyndham rewards book directly with hotel;4
me and girlfriend stayed at days inn for 4 nights at the end of march and we were very happy with it the service wasnt overly smiley and jolly but it was very efficient the room was fairly spacious and very clean not much of a view a brick wall but we didnt go to ny to look out a window the daily cleanup was great just one day they forgot to wash the coffee machine but i survived that after all it was nice to stay at a budget hotel that didnt provide instant coffee on the room the room was fitted with a safe which i couldnt get working but i think i did something wrong the internet room eats dollars quickly but there are cheap internet cafã©s nearby the subway couldnt be nearer and it takes you straight to penn station on downtown manhattan;4
driss front desk staffer was welcoming and warm professional and accommodating the hotel has old world charm clean if small rooms friendly staff great rates and centrally located good 24 hour diner downstairs twentyfour hour drugstore across the street pennsylvania station subway one block away it was a good choice;4
this is not a 5 star hotel by any means but it is nice its pricey for what you get but the location is great to universal the bathrooms need some updating if they want to be considered top of the line and i still dont understand why hotels charge for wifi still this really should be included in every hotel stop nickel and diming people the bar and restaurant are a good thing to have in this location since the universal city walk basically closes at 9pm so if you want to stay out a little longer its nice to have another place to go;4
after some research we booked this hotel for a four night stay in new york the location was fantastic just on the corner of broadway a few blocks from times square staff were friendly enough and answered questions whenever we had them we booked online and asked for our room to be as high up in the building as possible to minimise traffic noise and have a better view they put us on the top floor 12 which was great only criticism about the room 1208 is we were in front of the lifts so had everyone chatting outside our door but it wasnât too often so we didnât ask to be moved we booked a double deluxe room which had two double beds with just enough room for two people to leave their luggage and move around warning the beds are incredibly soft and well used one;4
staying here for a gala event the hotel is nice notwithstanding its proximity to universal studios which makes the atmosphere touristy ive stayed at the next door sheraton before and this is much better in comparison my review is 4 stars due to the digital key that keeps failing went to front desk twice before they were able to successfully reset it by training they gave me a duplicate card keybut whats the point of the digital key if you will still carry a duplicate;4
the hilton was filled with friendly staff from arrival to departure our concierge jesse was extremely helpful providing cheat sheets for getting around los angeles and getting the most out of your tourist attraction visits the only downside was the hotel especially the lobby was very cold at all times and when one elevator was not working the process to get downstairs was extremely slow room was nice enough;4
so far my stay has exceeded expectations i was worried about some of the negative comments posted here regarding customer service but the staff has been bending over backwards to accommodate thank you front desk especially jerry ganita and eugene;4
so i cant lie the hotel pictures online are much nicerthey were clearly taken when it was first refurbished its nice enough but the place has wear and tear nowif your from uk its premier inn vibesbut it was clean and a absolutely fantastic comfy bed which you need as new york is alot of walkingbut the one thing i can say with my chest is the staff are all amazing welcoming and friendly with great advice and honest opinions iceiz and jeff where the best ever and helped us navigate ny with ease and every suggestion they had didnt fail us jeff even drew us out a map of what to do and how to navigate the subway the two of them made our trip and i couldnt thank them enough lovely people and professional with such nice vibesthis hotel is such a great location its;4
we really enjoyed our stay at the hollywood hotel our room was clean as well as huge the staff were very helpful and pleasant the breakfasts were amazing as well the gardens and grounds were very well kept and lush the parking was very convenient while the location was central so that we could drive around la there were no restaurants in the immediate area unfortunately from our experience the area surrounding the hotel seems to be on the decline i realize the hotel has no control over this and the hotel itself was great but it is worthwhile noting;4
the the rooms were clean and spacious but a bit outdated could do with some refurbishment with new carpets and colours but overall it was a great experience we had a room with view of the hills which wasnt very pretty but we didnt spend much time in our room so it didnt bother me too much it took us about 45mins to get to the hotel and a 90 taxi fare but once we were there everything else was very conveniently located only about 15mins to downtown los angeles all tour buses pass by the hotel and universal studios is next door the staff were all very friendly and courteous i couldnt fault their service checkin was fast and efficient they even gave us a room before normal checkin time we used the travel desk service and they were super efficient the;4
great location friendly welcome the room on the 23rd floor offers a fantastic view price performance was top hotel is a bit old we would book again from the pennstation directly at the hotel you can see everything in manhattan;4
this is not likely to be the smartest hotel youâll ever stay in but it is very conveniently located and is good value for money right near penn station so it is easy and cheap to get there from jfk great local deli nearby which is really convenient for a nice breakfast or late night snack;4
great location walking distanceabout 5 minutes to universal studios and city walk beds were comfortable rooms were nice hotel had many amenities store starbucks and restaurant friendly staff ordered ice cream and room service was fast and polite short drive to holllywood would stay here again;4
we stayed in the hotel for four nights in late february a nice welcome at check in and offered complimentary breakfast grab and go style from the coffee kiosk in the main reception the room was nice newly refurbished on 21st floor while the public parts of the hotel could do we updating the staff were very friendly and accommodating to any request the best part about the hotel is its location on 8th ave three subway stops uptown and you are in central park four subway stops and you are on broad st ground zero one tower observatory etc and then only a few blocks walk you are at the port authority bus station for those in need of retail therapy and a trip to jersey gardens bus111 14 return also hotel directly opposite madison square garden i would highly;4
the hotel is nice and clean located in a quite area very close to a metro station which is really convenient our room was pretty not so big but comfortable we generally dont have any complaints the breakfast was good many different options plus a cook every morning makes omelettes according to everyones likings the staff was overall friendly except for one lady on the frontdesk who had a pretty rude attitude i wish i could remember her name i would definitly recommend this hotel to a friend other useful tips for your visit in la we bought the los angeles go card and turned out to be a very smart move cause we really saved over 50 on entrance tickets must see places universal warner studios santa monica beverly hills not so worth the fuss hollywood;4
my very first trip to america new york and have to say we really enjoyed our stay we brita love our tea and down fall was you could only get a cup of tea in the morning and you had to go down to the lobby door men were brilliant desk people could be a bit more helpful had great sleep bed lovely views good all in all fantastic place;4
i have just flown back from nyc today and am reflecting on the accommodation chosen the empire hotel was recommended by my travel agent and can only comment that their advice was sound the main features why this was a good trip was mainly because of the location the staff too were very hospitable and work extremely hard their efforts are to be acknowledged by the management teams they are excellent ambassodors to the hotels vision and reputation i especially liked how clean the room was and that is was quiet even though the traffic and usual nyc chaos were in close proximity in addition the ambience of both lobby and roof top bars were amazing so much character and charm particularly as it was valentines day too on this occasion for those whove not stayed in;4
overall we are pleased with our 3 day stay at the ameritania the location is great close to times square restaurants shows and the subway the hotel is tucked away from the busier streets and hustle of the city yet youre right there jeff the doorman added the personal touch to our stay he was cheerful friendly and took care of our luggage until our room was ready the room had an enormous beautiful mirror in the room it was was decorated attractively and was comfortable bedding was plush and inviting room and bathroom was very clean elevators were close by and came quickly even when they were busy if you want a quieter room opt for one of the interior rooms we had an option to do that but chose to have a view instead the view wasnt worth the tradeoff;4
overall the hotel is clean and staff are nice your in the heart of nyc so donât expect it to be cheap and donât expect the rooms to be of a nice size the only disappointing part of our stay was that we had to pay 20 to store our bags for a few hours before we left for our flight personally i think this should be free and included with your stay price like the majority of other hotels other than that it was nice and i would consider staying again if the price was right;4
we stayed two nights at the empire hotel june 46 2018 i should tell you first that my husband won a trip to new york city to attend a movie premiere so our stay was free yay the location was great for us right across the street from the lincoln center where our event was being held ballet david geffen hall and juilliard school are all right there short walk to central park strawberry fields is on the sw end of the park so that was convenient too plenty of nearby restaurants the hotel lobby is beautiful with sitting areas and a small bar restrooms and more seating areas on second floor that overlook the lobby checkin went smoothly and quickly room 210 room and bathroom were clean and uptodate yes it was small even smaller and darker than anticipated;4
booked this room last minute to visit a trade show found the room to be adequate and the staff very helpful i would certainly stay again and plan to on my next visit;4
great hotel good location rooms are clean and cozy and theres great staff mr ze is the bomb and great staff can make ones day rmpire is great for business travel or leisure will be my new nyc spot for sure;4
i traveled to nyc with my family during thanksgiving to see the macys parade and visit some of the sights i was very happy with the new yorker the staff was very courteous and accommodating during a very busy time we had a corner view room on an upper story and the empire state building was gorgeous especially at night the hotel is in a very convenient location close to the subway and within walking distance of herald square and rockefeller center we loved the tick tock diner which was open 247 and had good food at reasonable prices for thanksgiving dinner we tried the hotel restaurant and had a good meal there as well i would stay at the new yorker again and recommend it to others;4
we stayed for one night for a company party and booked a room on the executive floor this hotel is wonderful nicely appointed and the staff is great i was thanks over and over for my loyalty status which was nice the continental breakfast is located in the main restaurant and was great one of the best continental breakfasts iâve had at the hilton brands iâm not sure if this is attend brandwide but i sure hope so the room was nice and spacious the bathroom was well done and quite large the reason for my 45 review is the desk in the room was rusty the legs and coated in rust not what i want to see when i pay 300night additionally the shower head was terrible it sprayed all directions and all the settings were piercinghard sprays not what i would call;4
we stayed at this hotel for 7 days my stay was satisfactory the staff is very friendly also the hotel is located close to several landmarks on new york as time square the empire state building and station penn there are also several shops for shopping;4
its a couple of meters far from metro station on a quiet neighborhood the bathroom seem to have been renovated recently and bedroom is pleasant despite of old furniture the negative point is that theres wifi cover only on the hall dont working at room summarising it was a good stay and i recommend the hotel;4
location is the usp of this hotel almost everything in mid manhattan is walking from this hotel central park times square empire state etc very happening neighborhood gives a real feel of new york streets;4
when i first pulled up on a sat eve there was a huge crowd outside and security in the lobby i asked the front desk what was going on and was told it is aways like that every evening of the week also there is a popular rooftop bar in the hotel aside from the heavy nonguest traffic i liked it the decor of the lobby and rooms is very pretty and it was suitable for my needs with family in a junior suitewe didnt eat at the hotels restaurant but starbucks is on the corner and there are 2 good restaurantsrosa mexicanogood for celebrating family friendly and pj clarkes around the other corner close to central park subway time warner center i will stay there adain some people complain about the noise but i didnt have a problemi was on the 7th floor;4
i was gutted i had to leave my little nest in the jane i was prepared for the size of the single cabin room but not prepared for the dinky space saving touches that came with iti had a huge suitcase and did endless shopping and it never felt cluttered they get some things really rightbathrobe with pockets for traipsing to the shower refilled water bottle every day ipod dock and radio dvd player and telly free working and fast wifi and that was stuff i reckon you shouldnt expect for the price so to get it is a real bonus i am a big boutique hotel fan and love my luxuries so i came prepared bring flip flops for the shower my biggest worry was the lack of en suite and honestly i didnt mind a bit in reality if youre really squeamish then maybe think;4
honestly this hotel deserves 4 stars and im happy that before i even wrote this review i could agree with most people 1 the view this alone is worth the price if you get a high view on my first stay back in august of 2009 i received a room on the 22nd floor with a nice breathtaking view of the hills i must say i felt quite fab as most of my friends would say my second time earlier this month which is why im writing this the view was of studio city and a large amount of california as it seems because i could see beyond the horizon my gosh 2 the cleanliness i normally do not write about cleanliness because its normally at least a little to average of what i expect this hilton property is clean everything is completely clean and fresh for you they even supply;4
my wife and i stayed he for a week in november first room we had was at the back of the hotel with no view asked if we could change as staying for the whole week and was moved the next day to a large spacious room at the front of the hotel on the 7th floor reception staff very friendly helpful and professional decor of hotel is very pleasing and hotel very well located for lincoln centre central park and subway just across the road all staff very helpful would have given 5 stars but be careful with the mini bar as a small bottle of water is 700 and the hotel bar is very expensive also otherwise would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to nw york and i would certainly stay again;4
just got back from staying at this hotel room was lovely jeff the doorman was really helpful and javier the bartender was a ð would definitely go backlocation is perfect but away from noise excellent bar next door;4
in summary a great place to stay for a city break fun friendly quirky and good value more details we stayed at the jane for three nights last june at the beginning of a road trip down the east coast we booked a captains cabin to have a private bathroom and a little more space and we loved our room awesome decor lovely oldfashioned looking bathroom and lots of space for luggage the bed was comfortable and we appreciated the free wifi and free bottled water the only things i would have changed were that our room wasnt ready on arrival as arranged and i had requested a river view and we had a view of the carpark instead but this didnt affect our stay at all with only a few days to explore nyc we wanted a good location and werent disappointed we ate at;4
great location across from penn station and madison square gardens easy to get anywhere from here the rooms are small but nice staff was friendly hotel was clean parking is nearby with a discount;4
this hotel is such a great location for universal it is a stones throw away and you canât beat that it is kind of funny as we stayed at disney for three nights before moving here and stayed right across from the park as well but at a 50s style best western motel with outside entrances both spots were perfect because of location location wins over amenities for me as long as itâs safe and clean that said i stay at a lot of hiltons with work and they are usually nice this property no exception the service from all staff was impeccable our rooms 3 were well maintained and very clean our room had a nice view which is always a bonus even though we didnât stay in it much we ate breakfast here two out of three morning and typical to hiltons it was a bit pricey but it;4
the location is one of the best in nyc pasquale and his front desk team are outstanding and welcoming to this consumer who has visited the empire over 30 visits in 2 years however the changes by management are very disappointing the facility fee 20 which includes 2 small bottles of water and free wifiâminus the in room minibar and the keurig coffee machine is very disappointing perhaps management will reconsider their position regarding the facility fee and in room amenities;4
we recently had a two night stay at this hotel at the end of a vacation and were using it as a base to visit the very nearby universal studios we used the digital check in and chose our room in advance of arrival which worked fine but we did need to visit reception to finalise a few details yolanda was extremely welcoming and very helpful our room was ready early and being on the 20th floor we had to use the lifts they were very speedy and never waited long for them car parking was either valet or self parking both for a fee the self parking obviously being the less expensive option having said that the parking garage was of an excellent size with easy access to the hotel we had no concerns at leaving the car there our room with an excellent view was extremely;4
very welcoming well appointed room the staff jeff who looked after our bags and arranged our transport julian and gina in the bar who saw to all our needs in such a friendly way our room was beautifully cleaned each day would not hesitate to stay again when in nyc;4
stayed 2 nights in the small one person room however it had everything you needed tv safe free water and lots of cubbies and hooks to store stuff shared bathrooms were clean and had toiletries available front desk was very nice and the area was awesome overall a small room and shared facilities but very well worth it for the price;4
my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights in a king executive room on the 21st floor we loved it the room was very spacious had a table and two chairs and a sofa with coffee table the king bed was very comfortable with soft bedding and lots of pillows the only cons about the room is that the tv is old and not a very good picture and there is no inroom refrigerator there is a cabinet for the coffee maker and we thought that was the fridge but nope seems like they can turn those into minifridges we did have a safe in the room and one robe was provided in the closet we also had a park view room and we loved looking out over universal and the surrounding area overall it was a very nice room we opted for the breakfast package and received 4 breakfast;4
if youre going to any event at lincoln center this is where you want to stay it is literally steps away the hotel is very nice great access to restaurants inside and outshoppinglocal attractions and staff is friendly and accommodating;4
love the modernizing of the lobbylooking forward to a rest coming in the propertyneed to do more work on the air heating systemold and not efficientthe front deiso folks are greatbut seems to be very high turnover;4
we stayed for five nights at the ameritania the location is excellent never to far from anything the staff was very helpful and friendlythe room was well kept and always serviced we were on the third floor and the noice levels was not problem at all easy to get the hotel from jfk airport using the train services you will need extremely comfortable shoes to explore this great city;4
it was our 1st time in nyc we stayed with a french group during 1 week at the ameritania hotel and it was a really good experience 1st of all the location is perfect because we are right in the center close to so many subway and bus stations and you can go to many places by walking 2nd the staff was really nice and helpful especially majid who was here for us during all the trip to help us anytime we needed we strongly recommend this hotel;4
we booked this hotel most based on the price and we werent dissapointed the room was spacious and bright and the bathroom was huge the hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the metro tube station and its really easy to navigate the courtyard area is lovely and its a real shame the hotel dont do more to utilise it the breakfast options were great but it would be nice if they served food on an evening wed definitely stay here again;4
we stayed at the new yorker 4 nights while on our first visit to new york the location worked well for us since we arrived in the city at penn station which is just a block away the staff was friendly and helpful our room with 2 full sized beds was quite roomy clean and comfortable it accommodated all 4 of us easily the one thing lacking was a small refrigerator so we could keep some drinks cold we were on the 28th floor but never had to wait more than a couple minutes for an elevator;4
stayed here for 3 nights and although the room was small it was ok for the time we spent in there a coffee maker would have been beneficial its location was great for exploring new york walking distance to lots of great places;4
we were attracted to the location and price the room with two double beds had recently been renovated the concierge was most helpful and gave good directions to find our way around new york we walked a lot and used the subway and buses there was a view from our window overlooking central park we all agreed that if we returned to new york we would stay there againwe have already recommended this private hotel to friends;4
we had a pleasant stay at the empire hotel the lobby is beautiful and the staff is very professional we started to chat with someone from reception and after a few minutes we received great advice on restaurants for our anniversary dinner we had booked a standard room online with this website we thought we had a good deal until the front desk told us that the room we had reserved was actually a petite queen room there was absolutely no mention of it on the website which was very misleading be careful when you book your own room the man at front desk was able to find another room for us he wasnt able to give the upgrade complementary but was able to reduce it by a lot we then went on to the bar to order two glasses of champagne and it seemed like the pour was;4
this was our first stay at the empire hotel and it was very nice with just a few minor exceptions the location is excellent especially if you have any event at lincoln center the lobby bar has a cool vibe and friendly staff our room was very clean and mostly comfortable with the following exceptions the bathroom was quite small with a very shallow sink if you turned on the faucet to anything over a trickle the water splashed out of the sink and soaked your clothes the pillows left a little to be desired they looked comfortable at first glance but as soon as you put your head down they disappeared into nothing no support whatsoever there was a lack of outlets to charge phones i had to unplug the keurig coffee machine to charge my phone our last;4
recently stayed here in november the best thing about this hotel is the location opposite penn station for the subway a short walk 19 minutes to times square and empire state building itâs in the middle of manhattan too which is ideal as itâs not too far to go to the top like central park or downtown to the financial district i had booked a queen room with view and asked for a good view they put me on floor 37 out of 40 and it had amazing views to wake up to room was nice and cleaned daily would return and definitely recommend;4
i booked this place last minute and was delighted with this place it is so quirky i was in a single room and it is exactly like a ship cabin but with a flat screen tv included the bathrooms are shared on the floor i was staying on they are clean and they had a fantastic shower it didnt bother me at all to share them it was like a super posh hostel but with your own private space the concierge and desk staff are also very helpful there is loads to see and do in the area and the high line is right behind the hotel the only disadvantage that i found was that it is a few blocks away from public transport the hotel is located at the very end of jane street and i wasnt comfortable walking down there on my own at night time but that was a personal choice as i was;4
i arrived later than i expected due to the bad weather conditions but was able to check in quickly i found the room to be extremely hot when i walked in as did several other guests ive talked withbut soon figured out how to cool things down the room itself was compact but nicely decorated and clean not much of a viewlooking onto other hotel windowsbut i didnt come for the view the bed was very comfortable enjoyed my staybut everything in the room had a pricea high price ive never stayed at a hotel that charged you for in room coffeebut the coffee pods were 3 it would have been nice to have that for free instead i just went around the corner to the local starbucks i also went next door to duane reade and bought bottled water much cheaper than;4
excellent location for lincoln center comfortable bed linens and great shower reasonable breakfast buffet for nycvery accommodating staff would stay again when in the area recommend that a full size ironing board be provided in the room asked and one was dropped off but all hotels iâve stayed in provide standard size;4
we had a suite on the 82nd floor overlooking the hudson the room was clean and well appointed though a bit dated had a good sized fridge and a comfortable though somewhat small bed think it was a full sizewere used to a king my biggest complaint was the slow front desk service we arrived at 1 pm waited in line for 10 minutes only to be told our room wasnt ready we stored our bags and hit the city for a couple hours we came back at 3 pm and waited in line again to get a key on checkout we again found ourselves in a long line waiting to checkout we also found that we could store our bags but this time it wasnt free it was 2 per bag the new yorker is a big hotel possibly up to 1000 rooms there are only 5 stations for frontdesk staff so the;4
great location found staff to be friendly and helpful room was small very clean but in need of modernisation 50 shades of brown tick tock diner is a great place for breakfast no queues quick service tasky and reasonably priced despite the very brown and small room i would use again;4
highly recommend this hotel if you plan to go to universal studios it is an easy walk to the park 58 minutes or there is a free shuttle all of the staff is friendly and helpful checkin was quick and easy elevators are going through an upgrade so it is a bit slow at times but just allow yourself a bit of extra time and it should not be an issue i appreciate that they had elevator attendants to help keep things moving smoothly our room was on 19th floor and it was perfect for our family very clean nice view spacious bathroom super quiet and extremely comfortable beds we enjoyed room service on the first evening and it was delivered promptly and was delicious i also found the staff at the transportationtour desk to be extremely helpful i am not familiar with;4
the empire is right across the street from lincoln center just around the corner from a subway station and walking distance to any number of restaurants and central park so the location cant be beat room rates are quite reasonable the rooms are a bit shabby and dated the mattresses are firm to the point of discomfort and the street noise can be atrocious bring your earplugs but its new york what do you expect;4
excellent funky hotel with a great location only complaint is that the corners were not cleaned properly and we kept missing creamers for our morning coffee bonus was the lovely roof top bar at the top staff was very friendly and helpful would definitely stay again;4
so much to love the location is obviously excellent with great proximity to lots of public transportation my room turned out to be right next door to the muhammad ali room which was a total wonderful surprise the room was surprisingly big for a typical nyc hotel of this age but that might be because i got a corner room which had two fabulous windows the bathroom was a bit rustic but functional and it was nice to have the ticktock diner right next door very conveniently located staff was friendly and helpful as well i would definitely stay here again;4
we stayed at the empire for one saturday night in early february and had a lovely time the location is unbeatable for lincoln center events and we also very much enjoyed the rooftop bar with its stunning views of the city be there at sunset the room and furnishings were clean albeit somewhat worn and for a period we could distinctly hear the conversation of people either below us or next door the staff was friendly and helpful and we are looking forward to staying there again;4
i stayed for three nights with my teenage son and found it a really good base it is very close to the tube station and local shops the rooms were basic but clean and our twin room had a fridge in it which was really useful there were also plates bowls mugs and cutlery in the room the room was clean the showers were warm and clean as has been mentioned on here the staff werent overly friendly but they werent rude either i thought the hostel was excellent value for money;4
well well where do i start i stayed at yourstay central park for 6 nights with my girlfriend in a studio apartment after reading some reviews i was very wary but decided risk it when i arrived i found the apartment easily you are given the address with your booking i was presented with a bill youpay up front exceeding my expectation by 200 after providing proof of discounts and emails during the booking process we agreed on the price tip take all email corrspondance with you after that we got the keys to our apartment although a studio it was easily big enoughthere was a small but well equiped kitchen area the bathroom was also big enough with a nice powerful shower over the bath the furniture was modern and confortable and had a decent tvdvdvcr;4
i am always pleased with my stay at the empire hotel the rooms lobby and lounge are beautifully decorated impeccably cleaned and very cozy the vibe is contemporary artdeco very hip i was warmly greated and checked in by nick the hotel clearly prides itself on its attention to customer service the staff is always courteous prompt and cordial i look forward to my next visit;4
this hotel has a ton of charm i have to give it that from the staff in their classic bellhop outfits to the vintage decor to the delightful rooftop bar its totally gorgeous especially if you like that oldtimey feel and for someone traveling on a budget its very affordable especially given that its in such a fantastic location and speaking of that rooftop bar its amazing id come up there for drinks even if i wasnt staying at the hotel but if you are staying at the jane then you really outta get up there for an open air beverage and enjoy the view so overall i would totally recommend this hotel however there are a couple of minor caveats below here are some downsides that i cant really complain about but you should be aware of before you book;4
we came up from san diego to go to the hollywood bowl so this location was perfect the room was large and clean although we normally like to stay in boutique or more modern hotels this worked great due to its location parking and the service was good;4
the hotel is wonderfully located in the central park north area an easy walk to st john the divine cathedral columbia university and st lukes hospital located right across from the west side of central park makes access to the park very easy thew room is on the smaller side but clean neat and recently redecorated and it accommodates a queen size bed the en suite bathroom is newly tiled clean and includes tubshower the price was slightly under 160 a night including all taxes which is quite reasonable for nyc;4
had a good stay at this hotel close to metro to get to tourist attractions located close to an excellent diner the breakfast is amazing with a large selection and home cooked feel and the hotel was comfortable josã© made us waffles and eggs how we chose them michael at the front desk was very helpful all in all a pleasant stay;4
good location nice setting yet a bit noisy at night due to night club i cannot comment on the cost nor the reservations services because i was travelling on business the hotel definitely had character was close to central park and columbus circle;4
myself my husband and my 16 year old neice had a split visit to this hotel end novbeg dec and have to say first of all the location is amazing it it is within walking distance to a lot of the big attractions like empire state building macys and times square all less than 10 mins walk with madison square garden right across the road subway and bus stops right outside hotel and penn station a 2 minute walk the rooms are very comfortable and clean we had a newly refurbished room for both visits bathrooms are fairly small but ample staff were friendly enough but sometimes we felt they were lacking in effort when we returned for our second visit we were placed in a room on 7th floor which was above the diner and there seemed to be a stale food smell lingering in the;4
the hotel is in a great location not right in the center of times square broadway but within easy walking distance staff were helpful especially guys on front door and the rooms were spotless the mini bar contents were a ridiculous price be careful with internet usage as lobby is free but in your room is not enjoyed stay and i would recommend it;4
hotel brilliantly situated on broadway and near to times square and subway our room was smallest by american standards but well equipped outside noise was 247 probably a good idea to request a room not facing broadway hotel staff were very helpful particularly jeff whose local knowledge was excellent;4
clean simple and great location for kensington olympia staff really please the and would definitely recommend and stay again paid â£44 for 2 bed dorm and well worth it although shared kitchen and bathrooms wasnt a problem at all only negative was it was a bit noisy as group of men in bigger room next door;4
everything perfect on this hotel rooms are brand new reburbished i recomend this hotel the location service room decor cafeteria i used the shuttle to get back to the airport ok rates a little bit high;4
clean rooms breakfast every morning very good helpful people at reception small pool area but if you go to la you dont go to hotel and sit at a pool i think nice courtyard with bar they have sauna and fitness but i didnt use it bus stop near entrance and about 10 mins walk from subway station in the evening however i didnt always feel safe walking from subway station back to hotel because of some aggressive homeless guys;4
what impressed me the most was the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff the concierge was a treasure so helpful also the receptionists we met and rose in the chowder house was delightful ok our room was small especially the ensuite you couldnt have got in it if you had been a large person but the cleanliness was good and the bed very comfortable would definitely stay again;4
very nice hotel not in the best of neighborhood so just be careful clean do watch for the ants real nice breakfast with a variety of things served made to order omelets and the chocolate crã¨me waffles are to die forclose to metro that will take you to hollywood bled etc about 15 mins from universal hidden secret go on the roof and you can see the hollywood sign very nice court yard also has store inside to get some great souvenirs staff was great;4
nice hotel old like the most hotels in new yorksituated in very convenient location midtown manhattanjust opposite madison square subway in front times square 10 minutes on foot macys 5 minutes on foot hop on hop off buses stops all around has to be noticed that rooms are very small;4
thanks to majid my stay was wonderful the room was perfect and the bed comfortable no problem or complaint the only thing i would suggest is to enable each guest to control the thermostat and the television from the outset had fun in nyc;4
im just staying and the hotel dont like the cleanest thing but its ok the best part is the location its side by side to the 123 subway station so if you need to get the city wherever you go take the subway and go strongly recommend stay there;4
we stayed for 5 nights a few weeks ago excellent service at checkin got a fab room on the 10th floor with a fantastic view of the parkharry potter world room was very big lots of floor space 2 teenage daughters who like to shop beds were very comfortable such a quick walk to universal or the metro at the bottom of the hill we only took the shuttle back from citywalk one evening but it was efficient and had a digital board at the bus stop telling your how long the next shuttle would be while i was conscious of the liftselevator taking a little longer than would be expected it really wasnt anything to be negative about and we used them a number of times each day the only time that it was really notable was when we were coming from the pool area on floor 1;4
excellent location rooms are clean enough relatively small but fine for this price they have a kitchen that you can prepare something for breakfast etc loads of restaurants and bars around would recommend for budget travellers;4
lost our flight was almost 10 pm and the new one had to leave at 11 am so we searched for a hotel to spend the night and we went there it was 360 dlls two people for the night no food included the room was nice but kinda cold when we entered we took our showers and tried to use the dryer but it didnt work tried calling service and no one answered still we found a place to sleep and the bed was confy the light switch was weird though anyways guess it was fine;4
the location is great the rooms are modern and very tastefully decorated large flat screen tv and a great touch to have a decent sized lounge suite to relax on the only down side is usd 48 for valet parking leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth its classic corporate greed 48 usd would feed a family for a week or more in many countries;4
great hotel it is kind of dark and has not much of natural light the bar is great felt i was with chuck bass in gossip girl the service was quite good except there was no wireless i did not like that there wasnt a breakfast or dinner service like a regular hotel it was a separate restaurant in the mezzanine but it was a good thing that the food was eccentric and delicious the rooms were small and i think they needed more light and bigger bathrooms but the interior design was amazing loved my stay the location was super centric and they people that work there are nice;4
stayed at the ameritania for a few nights last week a larger hotel but decorated boutique style i had a street facing room that was a little loud decor and size of the room was great the bed was comfortable with a good sized bathroom i would stay again if the opportunity presents itself;4
spent 4 nights in a newly refurbished room 2 adults and 2 children who both have hidden disabilities first night the bath leaked we had to mop up the bathroom with towels next morning spoke to reception and they were going to fix second night bath was fixed but toilet would not flush went to tell recepion this was 7pm was told hotel was fully booked so moving room was not an option and they would contact maintance 30 minutes later came to the door and the maintanceteam had left and options were to stay in room or there was a room available we could move to they would also refund 2 breakfast we decided to move as no toilet til morning with 4 of us and children with needs the 2nd room was so much better bigger and better views no issues with second room since coming;4
mixed reactions to this hotel overall it is very good for its price breakfast and location however some of the staff do not come across as the friendliest reception and accomodating first impressions count and the arrival was not the most welcoming and i think our views with the receptionist ended up with us getting a room next to the lobby which is not the quietest one every night this room should be avoided at all costs room 137 that said you cannot fault its location close to the hollywood blvd and sunset strip it is close to the freeway if driving to access universal santa monica or indeed back to aneheim and we did all of that with ease and no traffic problems breakfast is as all other reviews excellent with something on the menu for everyone and the;4
perfect location in the city loved the contemporary design of lobby and hotel room i loved the downpour shower head and clean lines in the bathroom i loved the faux wood tile gave the bathroom a scandanavian feel we loved the positive vibe of the hotel and loved the location this will be our first choice on our next trip;4
we recently stayed here prior to a longhaul late night flight to make the travel day a bit less stressful things were off to a rocky start with the shuttle bus it was a hot mess multiple went past despite trying to wave them down as the shuttle shares passengers with a paid car park the one we finally got on was standing room only thankfully things got better from there the checkin agent was prompt and friendly we had a room on the 10th floor which was high enough to see over the neighbouring car park structure plus have views of the airport bonus the rooms were basic but spacious and had everything youâd need for a shortterm stay actually thinking about it they didnât have water glasses in the room which was a bit odd and inconvenient we had dinner down at;4
i stayed for 2 nights in this hotel the location is great near to everywhere the staff was very friendly and the room had a great view but a little small for 3 people;4
the staff and the service was outstandingthey were very knowledgeable with tourist information and how to make the most of the length of stay the rooms were as you would expect in a good mid range budget hotelat 169 usd per night for our two double bedsi thought it was good valuethe shower was awesome but it did take a good 10 min for the water to be warm enoughthe room was clean serviced daily had a coffee maker comfortable bedsand a hair dryer the rooms however were stifling hot there was a old fashioned aircon unit that was very effective but incredibly noisy and being unable to open a window and not get the room cool enough made sleeping difficulthaving a laundrette across the road from 8 to 8 made the family washing task easyat 250 or 350;4
the hotel room wasnât as i expected the bed had rips in it and i was not totally happy however we spent little time there the mini bar was extremely expensive and i wouldnât use it jeff the door man is outstanding the lobby area is well decorated location is amazing would i go back yes i would;4
stayed for 4 nights 2 couples exploring new york hotel is great well located for subway stops ideal for central park and the ballet opera etc staff are great very friendly and always pleasant rooms were adequate size for a short stay and the tvs are great minibar was extraordinarily expensive 8 for water is ridiculous the roof top pool bar is nice to relax when the sun shines this was also very expensive 1 gin tonic worked out at â£16 with the compulsory service charge thats the same as the top class exclusive artisan cocktails at the gong cocktail bar in the shard in london over all experience was very good but the roof top bar is overpriced i will just add that the roof top dj was a bonus great sounds for the sun;4
very convenient location we were on 12th floor bed was amazingly comfy very convenient location for universal studios and lots of great restaurants within walking distance downside was the lifts they took forever and at times just stopped we used the stairs quite often during our stay yes from the 12th floor as it was quicker;4
we drove in after 3 hour drive we enjoyed cocktails by the pool walking distance to universal studios and city walk also hollywood and griffith observatory service here excellent;4
the location of the empire hotel is great its not crazy busy at all hours of the day like in time sqaure great restaurants in that area columbus circle has a shopping mall and its by the lincoln center the staff was nice and our room is what we expected from looking it beforehand overall great stay for three days;4
the hotel is just 8 minutes walking from the subway station the area is great for dinner drinks or just hang out our room was tiny bunk beds but there was air conditioner so it was quite comfortable bathrooms are absolutely clean staff are very kind they kept our luggage for free the whole day until we went to the airport in the evening decoration is quaint but great at the same time;4
my wife and i stayed at the empire last saturday night we were celebrating her birthday with a nice dinner and see blue man group everything was great i work in the neighborhood and dropped by on friday and pasquale was nice enough to put a hold on a nice room on the 9th floor overlooking lincoln center upon check in saturday afternoon pasquale and jose took care of checking us in quickly and offered comp internet for the night room was smallish but decorated nicely and bed very comfortable shower pressure was awesome from rainsoaker shower head on sunday we had time to take a walk in central park on a beautiful day grab breakfast shower yum and check at was a breeze at noon caveat i forgot my kindle fire in the bedroom under the pillows called on monday;4
our family had lovely rooms very clean and spacious super comfy beds plenty of room to relax the cleaning staff was excellent front desk staff also superior its a very short walk to universal studios the main focus of our visit and we liked being able to come back to rest at the hotel before returning to the theme park at night for dinner and more fun so why the four stars instead of five at 2 am the smoke alarm battery decided it needed to be changed a shrill electronic beep about every 10 seconds began we were exhausted from our long day and sound asleep the beeping scared the heck out of us we stood on the table in order to reach the dang thing and yanked it down tried to figure out how to kill the noise finally successful but so shaken we never did;4
overall the hotel was great my wife and i loved the location and our room the staff upgraded us with no questions or hassle the room was bigger than expected for nyc and the bar downstairs and upstairs is great would definitely recommend this hotel for a site seeing vacation or romantic gateway enjoy cheers;4
the new yorker is a classic throwback hotel in decorum with uptodate luxury amenities i was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy by their great staff at the time of my stay i will say the walk up price charge for check in is a bit steep i was really satisfy with the deal i got and worked out with wyndham rewards staff in allowing me to stay for my time at the hotel being from new york growing up there and coming back to visit made it all worth the while at this classy establishment i cant wait to stay here again you cant beat nyc views;4
well donât over look this slightly tarnished gem rooms are small but adequate as a place to sleep shower and enjoy the city convent to public transportation and airport buses lots of ok places to eat and easy to get to and from;4
this hotel built in 1929 is very nice by todayâs standards the rooms are small and bathrooms dated but we loved it all the staff was fantastic and friendly in a great location for bus subway or rail travel i would recommend this hotel to all restaurants in the hotel are nice but there are many options nearby for about any type of food you want stay at the new yorker and you should not regret it go enjoy the âbig appleâ and have fun;4
staff were great very friendly we booked a double room with a living room added on for extra space great to find there were two bathrooms in the room much easier with a family of four beds were comfy my teenage daughter opted for the sofa bed and slept well housekeeping was good everyday the only thing that was missing was a machine to make hot drinks so i asked at reception and 20 mins later had a machine delivers that did tea and coffee we didnt use the ticktock diner but we did go down and use the take away facility and had coffee and a delicious cranberry muffin in the morning overall a very good stay i wish the american system in general would give you the price upfront rather than add facility fee taxes on at the end not a gripe about this hotel;4
pascuale was wonderful we had to wait until 330 pm for our room and he rewarded us with a nice suite he also patiently helped us with the nuanced wifi for each area of the hotel the empire is a great location just blocks from the park where you can experience the best of nature along side the thrills of new york city our unrushed breakfast on the mezzanine was good too;4
we were in nyc to attend an opera at the met great location right across the street clean comfortable room friendly staff the restaurant breakfast was great well priced would recommend will stay again should i visit nyc;4
lovely room for the three of us staying the best thing about this place is how lovely and helpful the majority of the staff were sonja in particular what a lovely lady its also very well connected with transport links we did not hire a car while in la but the hotel is situated near plenty of bus stops main routes and the la metro which meant we could travel with ease to all our desired locations and this was much less expensive than ubertaxicar rental;4
there was great service and very attentivethe prices were very high so was not able to afford tje hotel food expensive stay would love to visit again but cant affordi live in racine wisconsin maybe it cheaper out here;4
location was amazing close to macys and empire state building close to subway station tourism desk available room was a bit tight no fridge though it was cold enough outside that i put my fruit and yogurt by the window and it would be cool by morning;4
we had a very comfortable and pleasant stay at the empire bed was wonderful the bathroom was the smallest and most efficient use of space that i have ever seen great shower beautifully decorated great location right across from lincoln center;4
enjoyed a three night stay at the new yorkeran old fashioned hotel near penn station new york this is not a modern swish new york hotel but a quirky art deco palace with loads of character and great staff they even give us an upgrade on our room when they noticed it was my wifes birthday so we ended up with a good view and a quiet room close to madison square garden arenapenn station macys the empire state building and access to metro for the rest of the city not the best hotel i have ever stayed in but one i would use again and again;4
i have stayed at this hotel twice and would stay again given how expensive hotels can be in nyc astor on the park is good value for money the hotel is definitely not a swanky hotel and has its quirks but for how much you pay it is comfortable and easy to access the hotel is a about a 20 minute subway ride from all the hustle and bustle so expect to rely on subwaytaxi to get into downtown the hotel is right off a subway line so its super easy to hop on at 103rd which is only a 3 block walk the hotel overlooks central park and is about a 510 minute walk from restaurants and bars on the upper west side and harlem if you are looking for a cheap place to crash after a long day with helpful staff and comfortable bed astor on the park is for you just be prepared for a 20;4
we stayed here for three nights to see lady gaga for two nights the location of the hotel is perfect for getting around and the atmosphere on the southbank never disappoints from the actual hotel perspective parts of the hotel decor need attention the carpets needed cleaning on the 6th floor this hotel is not cheap and i expect my room cleaned or towels replaced daily without having to ask a member of staff at reception all staff encountered were lovely but the reception felt unmanned most of the time overall a nice time away and would definitely stay again for the location;4
a small but really clean room with a very comfortable bed basic bathroom but again very clean this hotel is near to everything we wanted to see with maceys and the empire state building on your doorstep every one was very friendly and helpful although the drivers are absolutely crazy will definitely be going back to new york and to the wyndham new yorker;4
we stayed here in oct 2012 the hotel is basic but eveything you need for a sightseeing holiday where you dont spend time in your room the room was basic but this is reflected in the price the bed was very comfortable the bathroom clean and functional the hotel is right across from central park and our room was overlooking the park the subway is two blocks down and very easy to navigate there is a fantastic cafe two blocks north which looks a little run down but has fantastic breakfasts and free wifi and an atm our room was cleaned every day fresh towels clean linens etc the information folder in the room is really helpful definitely worth taking the time to read if you walk two blocks west there are great bars pubs restaurantspizza joints along amsterdam;4
upon arrival we happened to be booked into a lower level roomnot a great view but jessica at the guest service desk was able to get us up to the 36th floor we now had a phenomenal view of the empire state building as well as the chrysler building the room was on the smaller side but it was immaculate and suited our needs we had not realized what an amazing location this hotel is located just steps from madison square garden and macys this hotel also has valet service we found out that is rare in nyc this eliminated relying on mass transit schedules or confusion this is now a wyndham affiliated hotel and worked well the reward systems they offer my 10 year old daughter loved seeing the rocketts and all of the holiday magic the city has to offer;4
we really liked this hotel and we specially liked the hotels breakfast they have fresh fruits scrambled eggs och waffles our favorite employee truly was hugo who was nice everyday and made us plain scrambled eggs haha nice hotel;4
i enjoyed staying at this hotel the decoration is very stylish i really loved the room interior and the bed was so comfy very clean and the photos correspond with the real view it also has a small gym which is a little bonus for those who like to keep fit located near times square and easy access to the main parts of the city the only thing i didnt like was that the room service sometimes come later in the afternoon;4
this really is an enjoyable property to stay at the rooms are great the pool area is superb and the gym is well appointed being so close to universal city walk its a great place to stay if you have a large group to entertain believe me something for everyone just a short shuttle ride away hotel staff are very friendly and helpful also;4
i have stayed in this hotel twice in the last 2 months 3 nights on both occasions i am happy with the neighborhood noise level very quiet cleanliness inside the room proximity to subway stop specially express 23 lines not happy with wifi signal is very poor worthless coffee inroom coffee tastes awful i do not know about the gymnot sure there is 1 the common area look dated worn outbut i am ok with that;4
we had a big room 1109 and a very small bathroom the room was clean good beds a bit noisy club and airco very good location friendly staff and doorman the bar and lobby are ok also the wifi only in the lobby thanks;4
fantastic stay lovely hotel would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again roll on 2018 ð the next time we are planning to go staff were friendly and helpful hotel is in a great location the perfect base to start your day rooms were clean and the beds were really comfortable;4
with appropriate tight security to get to the lift the new yorker by wyndham is perfect for a short stay in new york close proximity to everything from transport pennsylvania train station to shopping diners and not too far to the famous time square a stone throw away from madison square and good view of the empire state building staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful room a bit small but clean functional and comfortable overall a great stay for us;4
we attend the opera at the met once or twice a year we have been staying here before it closed and after it reopened it is most convenient and once here we just walk to restaurants etc but rooms are small;4
when i checked into the hotel i realized that i made the reservation for the wrong weekend pasquale one of the front desk employees went out of his way to find me a room although the hotel seemed to be fully booked i want to thank him for saving my weekend the empire hotel should be proud of this excellent employee i cant imagine anyone representing the hotel better especially at the front desk at checkin thank you pasquale i hope you will be there when i return next year;4
myself my girlfriend and five of our friends stayed here in march you get what you pay for in lifeour apt was warm clean and its in a great location we stayed in a three bed apt and we had plenty of room i agree that service was only average but who cares its nyc all you need is a place to put your head at night i will be back;4
the rooms were small like many new york city hotels but the bed was comfortable and the room nicely appointed the lobby oh my i met my future brotherinlaw at the new yorker in 1969 and i remember vividly the gold elevator doors in the art deco lobby the shape of the hotel room doors were concave then it was a nostalgic trip quite comfortable;4
we arrived on july 9th for a 5 night stay on arrival we were offered early check in for 30 more which we gratefully accepted i had been corresponding with gisele on the front desk before travelling to confirm my booking with bookingcom and the price as it seemed very reasonable for 3 adults in july we received a second floor modern room with 2 queen beds the room was massive for the 3 of us and was exceptionally clean plenty of towels and toiletries although we prefer to use our own there was a safe a microwave and a fridge which we used to stocked up on juice and water from right aid supermarket one block down to the left the pool area is very good comfortable loungers pool towels a water dispenser and more importantly a chair to help guests with disabilities;4
we stayed here just two nights to chill out before our long flight back to australia the taxi from the airport where we had to drop off our rental car cost us 80 ouch we could have caught the train we later found out but with changes at different stations and way too many bags to lug around we still wouldnt have considered this option the hotel is really nice and we got the choice of two double beds which is always a nice option because it means a bigger room the bathroom was really big and the beds comfortable the concierge and checkin staff were really attentive which was nice and gave us a recommendation of a chinese restaurant that delivered to the hotel we also had room service one night which was good food but as is always the case not cheap citywalk is;4
check in and check out went very smooth this hotel is directly across the street from busy penn station and a short walk to the shows on broadway shopping and food options its a very busy area so be prepared for crowds security checked for key cards before allowing anyone near the elevators so that was an added level of safety we appreciated we stayed in an older section of the hotel that wasnt renovated yet and the mattresses definitely needed replacing as they were too soft that was my fault as they were clear about it up front and i tried to save a few bucks next time ill pay the extra 10night and stay in a renovated room so my back doesnt ache when i get up;4
very nice clean hotel exactly what you would expect from hilton the concierge was extremely helpful as were all staff members position is perfect for those planning an early start at universal studios;4
the hotel was perfect for us as we were visiting universal studios the next day shuttles run regularly or its a short walk to the theme park the hotel itself was great clean nice cafebar area staff were helpful nice pool area only con was the lifts but they are addressing that they were very slow;4
booked via expedia good rates for location room furnishings clean space good we had 2 double beds bench very attentive staff i had an issue with the ac on the 2nd day and they came to resolve it within 10 minutes simple solution and fixed within 5 mins grateful for the ac given summer in ny we were on the 4th floor so did not hear street noise housekeeper checked on us daily best subway station for this hotel is the 7th avenue station 7 th and 53rd walk up 7th avenue to 54th street and the hotel is just on the corner managed this with kids and luggage hotel really perfectly situated for a walk to all major attractions in ny we didnât have breakfast there but would recommend angelinaâs for pastries overall super happy and would stay there again;4
we stayed for about 4 nights in this hotel it is dated and the room was small but the only time we spent there was to sleep and shower it was sufficient the room was clean beds comfortable and the place was pretty quiet at night the staff was amazingly helpful and friendly if it wasnt for the doormanconcierge we wouldnt have found our way around the city the whole crew was fantastic i would stay here again;4
good value historic art deco hotel near penn station msg location location location this is a great spot a block away from penn station and madison square garden no businessmen to be seen but a popular large travellers hotel rooms on the small side but clean with excellent bedding and mattresses in so called âexecutive roomsâ bathroom very compact but stall shower decent size with a great shower with great water pressure at least on the seventh floor mohammed in guest services was fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for him to address the hotel is a good value with regular options south of 300 per night all inclusive valet parking is 60 per night;4
as a solo traveler going across the us for bout 2 months i was on a budget and stayed in the singlebed cabin with shared bathroom for a small week the room of course was tiny as i expected but had a quirky charm there was enough space above and under the bed for storage of my luggage and shopping sharing the showering wasnt a problem during rush hour though being a bit closer to the bathrooms i could hear people coming and going;4
we decided to stay here because we were going to be going to universal studios citywalk etc and we would definitely stay here again our family had 2 rooms which were terrificthe beds and pillows were heaven maid service was great as was the free shuttle to universal studios and citywalk we walked back to the hotel at night instead of taking the shuttle though because the lineup was so long and actually its a pretty short walk all downhill so it was fine the pool area was great but they need more lounge chairs for the summer months as there were way more visitors than chairs available there is a large grocery store and pharmacy just a short walk up the street the only annoying thing is there is no free wifi in the rooms which in 2012 should be an automatic;4
i booked this hotel at the last minute but when i arrived i was impressed the room was clean and equipped with tv iron couch towels etc located 2 or 3 blocks from central park and theres a subway station on 96th st which is 2 stops away from times sq the hotel is surrounded by various food and convenient stores with most of them are 24hrs;4
as a last minute decision i stayed at this hyatt regency due to its proximity to the airportlax its literally walking distance to terminal 1vega baby lol the entire hotel is nicely ungraded and the doublewindows now block out any airplane noise awesome service checkin was nice rooms super new clean quiet i truly appreciate the remodeling since it was down well compared to vegas in vegas the rooms smelled like fresh paint glue also the fit finish was just off give the hyatt regency airport location a tryyou will be pleasantly surprised psonly 1 downside parking is 4400 a day omg stay there use uberlyft;4
we didnt spend much time in the hotel but the staff were brilliant bringing us surprise champagne for us to celebrate our wedding and the whole place was beautiful to be in and the room was lovely absolutely no complaints only minutes from some great pizza slices and central park;4
we got this hotel through hotwire and paid 83 per night we arrived at 7am to the hotel where they gave us both our rooms right away they also allowed us a late check out for one of our rooms i would say this is a typical nyc hotel older and small but it is in a great location you are a block from a bigger subway station on the red line which takes you right into lower manhattan there is a great corner deli that has more food options then you can imagine we ate there every morning and the prices were great i would stay here every time we go to nyc cant wait to go back;4
easy walk to time square all broadway theatres supermarkets starbucks across the street subway stations rooms are small but neat modern clean great because theres too much to see in nyc to be spending all your time in your hotel room;4
finally having made it to the big apple my booking pointed me towards morningside inn for my budget the location new york city is big and location is the biggest thing i can commend morningside inn for if one is flying into laguardia and i dont envy you if you are simply take the m60sbs bus all the way to the end of its line the broadway106th stop is just around the corner there are several good chain restaurants and even toms diner monks cafe from seinfeld is three blocks north the lobby and staff the reception is quite barebones the hotel is in a prewar building and you have to know the address as the sign for the hotel is hidden behind a tree on the front steps some staff are more chipper than others checkin time is at 2pm strictly enforced but;4
we chose to stay at the hilton universal city as we wanted to visit universal studios it was ideal for our 3 night stay we could walk to universal studios very easily it would have been great as someone else commented if you didnt have to walk down to the road to go to universal studios and there was an overpass still it didnt spoil our day there the hotel was extremely hectic most of the time with what looked like conferences and bus tours but we got lots of help from the concierge desk with things to do the staff were very patient and gave each inquiry the best of their time even though they were busy they were particularly helpful to me retrieving a bag i left on the shuttle from the port where we had departed a cruise for this i must thank constance and jesse;4
we made a last minute reservation as our outbound flight from lax was canceled getting to the hotel from the airport on the shuttle was a breeze and takes just a few minutes the checkin friendly and efficient iâm often confounded by the amount of time it takes some hotels to complete this task the room was comfortable and clean good body products and a good pod coffee machine my only complaint was the hamburger we had in the bar area the cocktail and waiter were both great the burger meat was a very low quality and super disappointing;4
ive been here four times on business trips if youre out in hollywood and universal studios its solid quick walk or shuttle up to the citywalk or down to the hill to the metro a bit old of decor but solid in all other regards;4
i enjoyed my stay at this hotel the staff was very pleasant room spotless and the location is extremely convenient i walked a couple of minutes from penn station to get there and walked across the street to the e train for the jfk train when i left saved a lot in taxi fares the bathroom was not so modern and the amenities were just okay but the whole experience was a positive one art deco lobby is pleasant to see;4
particularly staying at the empire was an incredible experience because as most teenagers i was a huge fan of gossip girl and this hotel was owned by one of the main characters in the series but not only the place is really great and well located literally a few minutes from central park columbus circle lincoln center broadway subway and they have great restaurants near too but also the staff is very helpful mr ze was great he got us a junior suite which had an amazing view and wifi access the only prob was the shower the water pressure was nice but there was no door so the floor got all wet even with towels as rugs also the lighting in the whole room was dim but we were okay with that anyway considering the location the staff and the rooms it was a;4
great location nice hotel rooms well equipped could do with some improvements but you are really only in it to sleep didnât dine at the hotel donât think it was even an option due to covid staff helpful enough although the lady that assisted us at check in wasnât that pleasant didnât impact our stay hotel close to times square 3 blocks and many restaurants etc we got a taxi from jfk i think fixed fee 65 but took nearly two hours we arrived at jfk around 23pm took the same length of time going home hotel booked taxi for us again at a fixed price but he was 30mins late so just factor that into your timings etc rooms small but done the job three of us two double beds small fridge in room was useful;4
we flew out to ca to watch our son perfrom at whiskey a gogo at the end of rock and roll fantasy camp the hotel where everyone stayed was the hilton la our room was lovely on the 2nd floor below the lobby overlooking a woodsy area very clean classy quiet and understated friendly staff big buffets on the weekend beautiful fresh flower arrangements large lobby nice bar coffee stand that serves starbucks and a very nice gym we enjoyed ourselves had restful sleep and would go back again and recommend to others the only negative was the smell of seafood permeating throughout the hotel when the buffets were out the lobby was also chilly in the mornings;4
we were there for 5 nights food in the tik tok diner was very good quickly served and the wait staff were very attentive close to penn station and subways only problem was that the one shower didnât have hot water we had two showers so i could use the other one;4
i arrived at new york penn station by train at about 9am on a weekday morning and i was very pleased to find just how close the hotel was to the train station excellent location unfortunately my room wasnt quite ready yet but the very friendly staff member at the front desk was able to do a precheckin for me she suggested i come back around noon so i left my luggage at the bell desk and headed out when i came back over lunch the line was a little long at noon for checkin so it took about 10 minutes of waiting before i was helped fortunately i got to deal with the same person as earlier that morning i wish id gotten her name who got me checked in right away i didnt get to see my room until later that night but it was quite nice on the small side as;4
extremely well located hotel very close to penn station we only used metro twice once for 911 memorial and other time for brooklyn bridge other than that everything was within walking distance staff at front desk very helpful rooms perfectly adequate and clean views over the city amazing beds so comfortable thank you new yorker;4
this is all you need in nyc we were travelling with a young baby so being in manhattan was more convenient for us we got a super good deal and didnt expect much from this place let me tell you i was wrong from the time we pulled up in front of the hotel to the staff at the reception the whole experience was great they have been super accomodating trying to help us find free parking on the street i had already booked an inside parking not too far from there for the 3 days but did appreciate the offer to help they switched us to a king size bed without us having to ask as they noticed the baby would be sleeping with us the rooms are small but very convenient anyway we spend most of our time outside visiting the city sheets and bathroom were clean i had nothing to;4
the hotel stuff were very helpful and nice they gave us a room with 2 queen size beds there was no heat but theyve brought us a radiator right away the water in the shower was always hot and the towels were replaced daily exept for the last day for some unkown reason plus the room was cleaned every day although we had to ask for soap and shampoo when we ran out of it the subway station is located on the corner of 103rd st and 8th ave and the hotel is located on the same avanue between 105th and 106th 23 minutes of walking;4
we were a little nervous after booking but up on arrival we were relieved ronald the bell man was really nice and helpful all the staff from check in to check out was pleasant and helpful when we arrived the front desk staff upgraded us to a king room at no additional charge this was great great room1111 people were saying how slow the elevators were not the fastest but more than adequate they were nice and clean we traveled the subway everywhere we went from brooklyn to the bronx this was really convenient as there was subway stations just a few steps from the hotel there are a lot of great restaurants close bywalking distance drug stores convenience stores really great location with a reasonable price in room safe was large enough for a 17 inch laptop;4
we planned a trip to new york to experience the christmas holiday in new york we loved our stay at the new yorker it was central to everything we wanted to do with access to times square broadway and rockefeller center the concierge service was stellar as were the entire staff we were treated like royalty our room was on the 25th floor with a great view of the empire state building the room was tight but very clean and well maintained i will definitely be staying her on our next trip to new york;4
the hotel was a fabulous location near times square the hotel itself was great our room was a little on the small side but to be honest it didnt affect our stay as we werent in the room very much the only thing i would say would be to include basic tea coffee facilities in the room as there werent any and we had to keep sending out for hot drinks which was a pain tbh jeffrey on the front door was excellent very friendly and helpful great trip to my favorite place in the world and cant wait to go again xx;4
i stayed here for 4 nights in june 2014 with my mum which we booked as a hotelflight combo with an airline we had a room with two double beds and it was a good size with plenty of space around the beds and ample space for us both the bathroom was quite small but not cramped and had everything you need the room was cleaned to a high standard every day our only issue was that the air conditioning was loud but we got used to it the rooftop bar was very nice although a bit lacking in shade some umbrellas for the tables would be a good addition the pool would be great for cooling off but a bit small for exercising in as others have said the concierge was fabulous and very helpful with great suggestions the location is also great close the park and not far to;4
only stayed for 2 nights but the visit was well worth the money the hotel is located on a key spot in manhattan walking distance from central park columbus circle and the lincoln center opera ballet music i especially liked the friendliness and flexibility of the staff reception restaurant etc for example i lost my keycard and it was no hassle getting it replaced in 3 minutes i had a new one my room wasnt big but that is no problem i was only there to sleep bathroom ok very good rain shower one thing for improvement the airconditioing is old and its noise can be a nuisance tip bring earplugs which i always have with me during traveling;4
spent nights here in marchbusy hotel but great stay as many have mentioned rooms are crampedthings like side table only on one side of the bed bathroom very tight with no place to put your things however nice shower and great loccitaine soaps and shampoos free wifi in the lobbey and mezzanine area only would be great to have throughout hotel as many people sitting around public areas on their phones and computers impossible to park outside hotelwe had a hire car and did lots of shopping and hoped to drop off our bags at the doorno chance was on the 11th floor and heard traffic and sirens through the nightbut not a real issue location is excellent easy walk to times square central park and subways overall would stay again for sure did price line to get a lower;4
we stayed here the night before our early morning flight to avoid rush hour am traffic the hotel is very modern very clean with all the amenities you require if you arrive via uber be sure to specify the hyatt regency lax not the hyatt place lax which is what comes up first in the uber app we ended up at the wrong hotel and had to catch another ride to the correct location;4
absolutely beautiful decor large rooms and bathroom had a coffee shop gift shop and can pick up basic needs we were there for only a few hours so cannot comment on distance to city they provide a free shuttle service to and from the airport friendly staff and a pool nothing else to do around the hotel very happy with our quick stay served its purpose;4
rooms are a bit stuffy but huge for manhattan hotels bathrooms tiny front desk helpful great location;4
every time i go to to nyc i end up staying at the new yorker hotel and its for a couple of good reasons its much cheaper compared to the other 4 stars hotels in manhattan even cheaper than 3 star hotels sometimes and its so central same street as the empire state building and madison square gardens and just a few blocks away from times square the public library rockefeller center and 5th ave if youre are going to have some crazy shopping during your trip also if youre lucky enough you can get great views from the rooms on the top floors including landmarks like the chrysler and empire state buildings the only glitch is that some rooms can be quite small but if youre not spending much time at the hotel that shouldnt be an issue also internet is not included;4
our stay at the empire because we didnt know the city and it was where friends were staying that were attending the same events now i know we were just sleeping in the room but for the price it bit more space would have been nice also how about a free coffee or something you are charged if you use the in room coffee maker its cheaper to go next door to starbucks the staff is excellent and freindly some furnishings need a bit of an update;4
was in nyc for 10 days vacation and stayed here the entire time excellent location for doing all the touristy things we went from the statue of liberty to central park to coney island everywhere in between either walked or used the subway for everything lots of places to eat shop around the hotel and the subway couldnt be any more convenient staff posted at elevators checked room keys for security one concierge not too helpful second one was better checkin staff nice friendly very accommodating lobby was always hopping best thing we liked about the hotel is its location least things we liked was the nonview from the room the size of the room however this was totally expected so didnt come as a surprise and the outdatedness of the bathroom but;4
i stayed at this hotel for two nights when i took the bar exam last month i didnt spend a ton of time in the room but if youre going to be in nyc you really shouldnt spend a ton of time in your room the price was right and the location is incredible the staff was nothing but friendly and helpful i had to check out a bit after 6 am on my last day and i was concerned that i wouldnt get good service at such an hour however the young man at the front desk was chipper and did his job properly i also had to store my luggage for 12 hours which was not a problem the staff was very accommodating my room was very small but certainly did the job i had a full sized bed that was more comfortable than i expected the shower was strange overhead only one door so it was;4
great stay for the money we were close to many major attractions the staff was very helpful and friendly the only issues were its a bit noisy but to be expected in the city and our room door keys didnt always work properly;4
overall we had a good stay the carpet in our room was pretty filthy and needs some desperate tlc but everything else was clean and nice the only other issue we had is the hdmi ports in the tv did not work;4
liked the interior liked our suites loved the staff maggie at the reception desk made us feel welcome the concierge i forget his name was very helpful and entertaining took our three teenagers 17 18 20 yrs they too loved it right at the corner of broadway 10 minutes walk from broadway show sister act hilarious show opposite lincoln center absolutely a must do it again;4
this hotel was very convenient good shuttle bus service to and from airport handy if somewhat overpriced cafestore downstairs good gym my daughter loved watching the planes taking off and arriving the room was clean and comfortable only criticism was that the hotel was just a little bland the kind of hotel that feels like every other hotel also some of the staff were really friendly and helpful others not so much;4
had an awesome stay here close to public transport and not far from most tourist things staff were very friendly and helpful special shout out to hugo who cooked breakfast every morning would recommend;4
i love this hotel for its art decostyle architecture its location and the bed sheets it is about a block or so from penn subway station few more blocks from javits center and the megabus stop we reserved a room with two double beds and it was spacious enough we enjoyed the view of the empire state building from our bed 34th floor the room itself and the bathroom were very clean with fresh towels and sheets with a crispcool feel the room had a safe and a good quality hair dryer it didnt offer a mini coffeetea maker though it has a lovely art deco lobby with good security you have to show your room key in order to take the elevators the concierge service was very helpful and friendly the surrounding area was very pleasant as well with the wellknown 34th st;4
daughters choice as she is into retro this retro that this was amelias first choice amazing building rooms spacious very clean also loverly and warm shame restaurant is a diner but not to worry breakfast was good also lots of eateries in the area;4
good centrally located hotel on 7th ave room we had was small but had everything we needed staff very professional and good lobby security 3 restaurants in hotel the tick tick is good new york style diner food and open 24 hours would definitely use this hotel again;4
we stayed at the jane for 10 nights in march 2012 sleeping in one of the cabinbunk rooms the rooms look as small as they are in the photos but if like us its really just a place for you to sleep then its fine although small the rooms are very well serviced fresh bottled water replaced every day laundered towels and dressing gown plus complimentary slippers for the duration of your stay and theres an ipod dock and a tv per bunk all meaning it definitely makes it a hotel rather than hostel our room was not ensuite we shared two showers and two toilets with everyone on our corridor however we never queued and they were immaculate at all times shampoo and shower gel was provided in the hot and powerful showers checking in and out was easy and they held;4
location perfect staff is courteous and helpful well organized and ran smoothly for a large city hotel room is simple but clean meets expectations the corridors could use a facelift check in was flawless and reception staff very helpful;4
the room had a great view of the california hills and was overlooking the outdoor pool the restaurants on the main floor served everything from walkup coffee to sitdown dinners it was a busy place but didnt feel rushed or overwhelmed the rooms have been updated recently and were nice;4
great location walking distance to hellâs kitchen and times square lincoln center and columbus circle were even closer subway was a block away the rooftop bar was amazing great view and incredible service hotel staff was friendly and helpful room was clean and surprisingly spacious only one regular coffee keurig pod provided in the for all 3 nights i will stay there again;4
we went on a family vacation last june with our kids 10 8 4 and our friend recommended that we stay at the hilton universal since we really intended to visit universal studios since they have a free shuttle that goes around we didnt have our own car and we had our friend bring us around the city rooms were big enough with 2 double beds to accommodate all of us though a little dated not much restaurants and shops in hotel and nearby mainly good if youre planning to go to universal studios;4
small room beautifully furnished with loads of electrical outlets and desk space room had only 1 robe and 1 set of towels the bathroom had a narrow shelf that was too narrow for women items there was no refrig or any ice maker on the floor nor was there a map to locate the nearest floor where an ice maker was security was top notch no one could get in this hotel without a security guard checking ny is crazy and this location in right near train station;4
we always stay here to go to universal its super easy an just a grest place all staff is great we come every year for universal hhn never really had any complaints with our stay we will be back soon;4
hotel was normal high standard you would expect from hilton great as there is shuttle bus to universal also only 9 minute walk only downside as a coeliac they were not very helpful in the buffet no gluten free bread i had to wait a good ten minutes for scone type cakes for breakfast which were still frozen in the middle i did complain and they adjusted the bill but for around â£15 for breakfast at that standard hotel i would expect more care with serious dietary issues generally in both las vegas and los angeles the improvements to knowledge about gluten issues had increased greatly since my last visit 9yrs ago used the gym and it was so hot we used the outside pool and hot tub would i go again yes but would eat out;4
the service at the front desk was excellent itâs proximity to universal studios is convenient the rooms are comfortable but in need of a facelift our nonsmoking room smelled of cigarettes we bring a portable air purifier when we travel so we were able to get rid of the smell showers flood the bathroom floor a little when we shower the door seal not working overall pleasant enough stay;4
all the staff at the empire hotel were phenomenal when i was taken ill with a major heart attack whilst staying there i would especially like to single out bernard from the security team who quickly summoned an ambulance crew and i was swiftly taken to hospital where i received a stent under an emergency procedure without his swift response and actions i would not be writing this now he was also very helpful to us when i was discharged from the hospital back to the empire hotel;4
my wife and i just stayed at the empire when visiting nyc to celebrate her 50th birthday we received great service from the staff especially gunita who surpised my wife with a special birthday gift delivered to our upgraded room the hotel is a short distance away from the subway which gave us convenient access to the entire city the surrounding neighborhood is filled with neat shops and restaurants well come back again;4
we went to manhattan and stayed at the new yorker hotel we have been there before and love the style and atmosphere and design they house the tik tok diner which is a great and reasonably priced family restaurant our room was a two bedroom suite and very spacious we had asked and hoped for a better view last time we had a great view of the empire state building but cant get everything we went to see beetlejuice the new yorker is convenient to all of the theater district it also has great subway access the 34th street station is right there hoped on the subway and it was a ten minute ride up to the museum of natural history which we always wanted to see we had a minor plumbing issue in the bathroom that didnt get resolved but it was a weekend and did not;4
we enjoyed our stay and found the hotel adequate friendly staff always wiling to help location is fantastic for our needs its an 45min walk from the world trade centre 15mins from times square hotel is dated yeah i know its art deco but the decor is tired the tiles in the bathrooms need grouted carpets are wearing thin hot and cold water wouldnt mix well to get an adequate temp too hot or too cold would i stay here again definitely would my wife probably not cost is good though so it depends on circumstances i am sure;4
this hotel is the best compared to the same level as per cost of hotel we had been into i consider staff are honest as per what had been experienced when a counter staff returned back my money when i accidentally gave double the amount of what is required they are very accommodating and very professional special mention is staff cecile shed helped us a lot on everything we need also oralia with her great omelets waffles and friendly smilesthe hotel is complete of everything a traveler may need faraway from more expensive hotels weve been and rooms are spacious being close to metro station is another advantage and for east aseans like us restaurants like thai chinese japanese and filipino are available in the area close by we are very happy on our nine days stay;4
while the location is good the overall cleanliness of the building was satisfactory the rooms bathrooms are badly in need of updating renovation and deep cleaning staff was excellent on all levels and very helpful;4
me and a friend traveled to new york on the 17th june and decided to book this place we had looked at previous reviews on here and they were up and down good and bad so we didnt quite know what to expect upon arrival the staff were nice and friendly and spoke fluent english he gave us our key and told us to go have a look at the room before we pay we checked out the room and it was all you need for a 5 night stay in nyc clean fresh safe and quiet our bedding and towels were changed daily and the maid was also very helpful and friendly we never used the kitchen in the hotel as we were on holiday who wants to cook on holiday super friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived till we left if i returned to new york i would defo stay again super cheap 7 or 8;4
the hotel was older but clean the building was very attractive the room did have a funny smell to it the staff was friendly and helpful the price was good the hotel personnel gave us the same price as the different travel websites offered under the same terms which was nice the hotel was out of the way a bit so you had to drive to get to restaurants and sights the breakfast that was provided was good they offered omelets made by a chef fresh fruit waffles and a good variety of cereals including muesli and fresh bread products and pastries;4
my partner my son and i stayed for six nights in may a beautiful older hotel in a very central park of new york right next to 34th st penn station madison square garden walking distance to times square and empire state building the room was very comfortable great beds and pillows shower was okay the hot water kept dropping and pressure wasnt stable rooms were cleaned daily and great service security downstairs made you feel safe staff friendly would stay here again;4
stayed here due to location for universal king room was huge with great views from the 17th floor room large and clean but felt dated wasnât any bag for ice in the room so called down to get some delivered and felt obliged to tip even though they should have been in the room to start with easy undercover parking for the price and location would stay again for a trip to universal;4
just back from staying at the new yorker hotel lobby is beautiful love the art deco elements of it room had no view at all but we were hardly in the room great shower and bathroom room a decent size and had art deco furniture and accessories we had coffee making machine in the room and we were given fresh bottles of water everyday by housekeeping we paid for a fridge and i would recommend you do that 30 one off fee rooms have a safe the room was very clean iâd say 90 of staff were friendly and helpful great location for station shopping and sites tick tock diner and italian bar and restaurant on site which are great for ease of use but very expensive we did tick tock twice nice food and good service we would stay there again;4
our experience at the new yorker was ok the price was good for manhattan great location right next to penn station elevators were a bit slow but not terrible the pressure of the water at the 20th floor was so strong and the water so hot that after walking all day it was wonderful to be able to take a bath;4
we stayed in may for 4 nights the location is excellent to explore downtown and uptown nyc rooms are small but adequate for a few days and are authentic art deco the tick tock diner is part of the hotel and offers a genuine american diner experience 247 try the eggs benedict this was our second visit so we can certainly recommend the new yorker paul di;4
this is a great place the restaurant has very tasty food and good service there is a rooftop bar overlooking the hudson river and it is a great spot to enjoy a beer on a summer night i came there with my friends and the crowd was fun and exciting we all had a blast there;4
very nice accomadations great location central to our interests pleasant management and team lounge area and lobby very comfortable plenty of quality restaurants in very close proximity it is nyc;4
the best thing about the hilton is the location 5 minute walk to universal studios and city walk hotel was modern and clean room clean smell upon entering and modern with upgraded linens and amenities corner room with great view and floor to ceiling windows now the issues checked in at 1015 am was asked if i wanted a early check in for a additional 2500 dollars why the extra charge supposedly extra cleaning fee baloney money hungry hilton there is no extra room cleaning if the room was available then we should be able to check in when we arrive if not then we wait i was very turned off by this and i did not pay the 2500 dollars out of principal since the room rates are already high next morning woke up and headed to the shower 745 am luke warm;4
to be honest we were a little concerned having read some of the reviews of the empire however we neednt have worried the location is excellent right by the lincoln centre and close to 5th avenue and central park our room was small as they all seem to be in nyc but well maintained and everything worked great shower with good pressure staff were excellent especially dennis on the main entrance who sorted out our transfer back to jfk no there isnt a breakfast service at the moment but starbucks is a few steps away and we dont eat much at breakfast anyway lots of nice restaurants close by the lobby bar has a good atmosphere and bartenders who actually remember your order the next time wed certainly recommend the empire;4
nice stay in a remodeled modern hotel with comfortable rooms and good service but understaffed for valet parking and it seemed like the outside windows had either not been cleaned or were the original old worn out glass;4
my daughter and stayed here on our way from australia to the east coast the hotel and rooms were very nice we were happy to be given an early checkin after a long haul international flight but surprised at the surcharge this hadnt happened in other hilton properties weve stayed in the staff were very nice concierge especially helpful fresh apples and water in the foyer was a nice touch the free shuttle to and from city walk was excellent a nice close walk to the metro station toothe only negatives were the restaurant was very expensive compared to other hotels we stay in and the lifts were very slow overall a loved stay;4
bit of a wait for saturday evening check ineverybody was very helpful and cheeryno hot water on morning of my check outlady at the front desk said she was sorrybut i dont really think she wasgood location easy to restaurants and transportationattended the operasuper easy to trot across the street at intermissionwould stay again but shower the night before;4
the hotel is easy walk to the universal citywalk and studios which was our main criteria for choosing it we were even able to run back from the studios to fetch some dry clothes for our kids when they got wet at super silly fun land the room was very comfortable with all the facilities you would expect and a great view the service was personable and we got free wifi which was a nice and helpful touch parking charges are a bit steep at 2400 per night but we knew this and it seems to be par for the course convert it to gbp and youll feel a bit better we didnt eat there or use the facilities this was just a place to sleep and it did its job admirably;4
hotel was very clean inside and out valet for parking was very efficient and the attendants were especially friendly hotel lobby was spacious and the restaurant made excellent breakfasts the room was spacious and clean no complalnts at all a great experience;4
the new yorker is a great standard hotel for a short stay in manhattan like most hotels in central manhattan the rooms are small but if youâre traveling with a small group or a single itâs a great option the hotel is very old with lots of character and plenty of art deco remnants left the rooms are a little dated but always clean i would recommend it for a quick business trip or weekend holiday;4
stunning hotel in a perfect location if you want to visit universal studios and hollywood there is a complimentary shuttle to universal city and studios rooms are nice and spacious with a big bathroom and all the amenities one needs when travelling we found the internet charges a bit hefty though and it was strange having the coffee machine in the bathroom instead of the room but besides that we could find nothing wrong with the room the breakfast buffet was lovely and the servers were very friendly in fact most of the staff were very helpful the only department we found rude and a bit abrupt was the concierge desk where we booked our tours they could have done with a more peoples person on the desk we will definitely stay here again if we return to los;4
services were great pretty clean environment great breakfast and i got amazing omelets this hotel could be way more better if they remodel a little bit and take care with their image looks kinda old its a nice place to crash and worth the price but you have to pay for parking around ud 20 per day the location is good is close to some attractions and to the freeway but if you expect to walk from the hotel and walk out in a nice neighborhood that is not going to happen if you like fancy little thing like me you will find this place just ok;4
best location for universal studios city walk clean hotel friendly staff starbucks coffee in morning pool hot tub nice comfortable beds great views temp in room really rose with sun in window had thermostat on 65 whole time and room stayed around 70 a degree or two lower at night and 5 higher if we kept curtains open with sun on window;4
we stayed at the ameritania for 4 nights our room was a bit small 310 and the bed was very soft and small there is a lot of noice coming from the street at night but youre in the centre of nyc we thank julian for his advice and help when we needed it love this guy also the rest of the staff is very friendly and helpfull;4
we stayed two nights at the hilton los angelesuniversal in october 2016 it is a 5 minute walk from universal studios the rooms were a good size for our family of four and the beds were comfortable the hotel is a bit pricey but the location is hard to beat the allyoucan eat dinner buffet was fantastic and included lobster crab and sushi among many other choices;4
very nice hotel in the right location lots of attractions plus start of bus tours are walking distance very busy hotel but plenty lifts rooms are small but very clean and after changing rooms we got the view we paid for of yhe empire state building;4
plan on paying 2840 per day to park confidential breakfast starts at 18 per person family of four thats 100 just for a simple breakfast so if you plan to stay bring lots of money because its definitely not cheap;4
absolute amazing time staying at the new yorker from the easy professional check in from miguel who even upgraded us to 33rd floor with a fantastic view of empire state building and madison square garden staff all friendly and helpful lady in tick tick restaurant advised us were to go sure seeing etc and what subway to take a walk away from penn station and a 5 minute walk to port authority close to time square i had a fab stay and will definitely be returning to stay at this great hotel;4
we were allocated a room on the 30th floor that had recently been renovated room was small but very nice no refrigerator so had to go to 28th floor for ice machine 28th floor looked a little shabby the location was great close to maddison square garden penn station lots of other attractions and shopping area i dont know why they charge a resort fee;4
i went here for a business trip to defend the north 2019 overall i enjoyed my room everything was fine except for the fact that there was no fridge in the room which is a basic basic necessity i had to keep getting ice and i brought food and drinks with me other than that everything was fine;4
being a former new yorker i can truly say that this hotel is perfectly located i can also say its a little too touristy for my liking but what can you expect the week before christmas in nyc when we arrived the lobby and bar were packed with tourists their suitcases their kids sprawled out everywhere you looked the staff at check in were fabulous so welcoming and friendly a great checkin experience our 8th floor room looked out over lincoln center with 2 huge windows and a lovely king size bed we had a deluxe room which we found to be comfortable and spacious by nyc standards the finishes were a bit rough around the edges which is of course from the high volume of tourist traffic it is a real shame they offer 3 keurig coffee in your room;4
my husband 9yearold son and i stayed this hilton for two nights during our spring break checkin was quick we booked a room with two queen size beds with a city view from the elevator to the bathroom you could easily tell this hotel was a little dated but staff was very kind and the room was clean the best part of it is the location it took us only 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to universal studios it was a nice stay;4
stayed for 3 nights and found the hotel to be in an excellent location for everything we wanted to do as with many nyc hotels they are on the small size but we managed room on the second floor traffic noises were not too bad however road construction starting at 7am was a bit much would suggest a room perhaps on a higher floor all in all we enjoyed the empire if you have a chance do go up to the pool deck for evening drinks;4
stayed at the hilton june 2628 pleasantly suprised upon an early arrival there was a room ready and were were even upgraded to a higher floor overlooking universal studios the room was spacious for the four of us it is a basic hotel room with mini bar mini safe writing desk lounge chair it does have a large closet to hold luggage so you are not tripping over it in the room which was nice they also provide an iron and full size ironing board the bathroom was large however the shower faucet dripped all the time you could tell it had been doing it awhile i find that amusing because of water conciousness in california the park shuttle was very convenient dropping off at city walk which is a destination in itself the pool at the hotel is large not a;4
we just came back from last weekender trip to nyc we stayed at the wyndham new yorker hotel the staff especially mohammad and susanna were very accommodating and helpful mohammad especially was very attentive to our needs when we checked in the hotel is very nice and the lobby was very grand looking also this property is a landmark for nyc the location couldnt be better right next to subway and macys the rooms were very clean and tidy and i had a nice view of the city in the 33rd floor you must have breakfast at the tick tock diner very good breakfast food and great service also a must try is the skylight diner across the street for the one of the best deli try the stage door deli amazing corn beef sandwiches and the best nyc cheesecake a tip for cheap airport;4
we have just returned from a few nights in nyc staying at the new yorker hotel first of all its location situated on w34th and 8th it is within a couple of minutes walk of ny penn station and the subway line a c e as with most of uptown manhattan it is walkable and relatively easy to find your way around you are staying fairly close to the empire state building 15 minutes walk from broadway and similar to times square perhaps 30 minutes walk to central park there are plenty of food outlets close to the hotel including a mcdonalds and a starbucks right opposite the entrance so the hotel you walk into quite a palacial reception very art deco design got checked in by a very welcoming receptionist it is worth asking for a refurbished room or a room with a view at;4
excellent location right next to subway station on 96th broadway which takes you on any train to 42nd street time square which is the main station so from there you can get on any subway line hotel was basic but clean with wifi king sized bed was massive and comfortable tv seemed to have a relatively good selection of channels available desk in the room if you need one air conditioning unit but even with 6 outside the room was quite warm only downside was the lack of power points to charge my devices phone camera table back up battery etc luckily everything has usb charging and i have a 5 point usb charger so i could do everything through 1 power socket bathroom was of good size and amenities were provided rooms could do with a lick of paint to modernise;4
hyatts never disappoint when traveling i knew from the reviews that this airport hotel was a good choice the only negative was the gift shop was closed the shuttle buses had a longer than expected wait time but overall was a wonderful experience;4
location location location this gorgeous historic hotel puts you in the heart of midtown with easy access to the theatre district and other points of interest the subway entrances were just around the corner and penn stationmadison square garden just short block down as a tourist i appreciated the security measures the hotel used and the cordiality extended by the staff we ate at the adjoining tick tock diner and had happy hour at the adjoining bar for pleasant and convenient meals after the theatre as a tourist visiting ny can be daunting and the availabliity of touristoriented services such as the the big red bus or grays tour lines with easy on easy off increase the enjoyment of our stay the business center was great for printing our return travel;4
this property was what i expect from hilton property was clean beautiful lobby and dinning areas buffett was amazing giving 4 stars because of lack of insulation between conjoined doors heared everything from the neighbors rooms;4
iâve read previous reviews and was very nervous but the hotel was a pleasant surprise after all itâs not a 5 star hotel but the room was close to 5 star nice and modern with a big flat screen tv air conditioning very clean and it even had a safe which was very useful the room was quiet it didnât have much of a view but we did not need it anyway staff at the reception was friendly and efficient and stayed positive under pressure they were even giving directions and tips to guests which was nice of them there is a concierge too by the way subway station 96th street is literally 20 meters away from the hotel which is very convenient the hotel is undergoing some sort of renovation but i never heard any noise the elevators are a bit slow and small sometimes itâs;4
want chic yes the staff was amazing they were attentive and helped us out with directions to the train and such looking for rooftop pool and bar yes the pool is super small and not really useful but a great place to hang out and grab a drink with the girls workout facility yes dont expect much but it is nice that they have one no worries you are 2 blocks from central park easy access to the subway yes it was a treat for this chicago girl to be able to use and find fun ways to travel around the city in the subway;4
we used wyndham rewards points to reserve a standard room 2 double beds we received an offer to upgrade to a suite for 50 well i was amazed that we had the upgrade and how huge the upgrade was the suite had 2 bathrooms 3 closets 7 windows a fireplace not usable couch 2 chairs and a large dining table with 6 chairs our space was enormous the doormen were so helpful all staff were very friendly my kids loved the tick tock diner next door we were able to leave our luggage before checking in free and after checking out2 bag i would definitely stay here again;4
i stayed in the single person cabin and it was exactly as described ie very small but since i wasnt spending much time in the room anyway only 3 nights it worked out great and i saved a ton of money compared to typical manhattan hotel rates i was surprised that there werent more stalls showers or sinks in the shared bathroom but i never waited more than a couple minutes for anything to open up probably helped that im a night shower person and usually got back very late 12 am btw the provided robe is way too short to wear safely to the bath and back to the room without exposing yourself if youre even just a bit taller than average and hooks in some partitioned area of the shower stall would have been helpful to keep change of clothes dry while;4
stay here quite a bit as it is the only reasonably priced hotel adjacent to lincoln center much improved lately newer senior management who really care looking forward to seeing what the new mezzanine restaurant space will be already has a great rooftop bar and restaurant iâll be back;4
the hotels location is very good excellent value for money clean but dated as maybe you would expect in nyc rooms were spotless and cleaned everyday new towels sheets etc the sheets were pristine white the only downside was the fact â£380 was taken from my card without any notification for the security deposit which was refunded on check out it would have been nice to know about it it could leave some short of spends overall a good hotel;4
nice hotel reasonably pricedright across the street from the met and near several good restaurants partking is nearby suggest that you reserve your parking space in advance i paid 50 for a 24 hour reservation which was only a block from the hotel;4
it was great except for the very expensive continental breakfast yet very limited food choices they should serve more hot food itemsthey were limited to sweets service is great room was clean the water availability would have been better if they leave it all night at the lobby;4
stood here with a coworker for business the decor is beautiful the staff extremely friendly and helpful the room was a bit small but it was fine we have a window view which was pretty great for someone who wasnt going to be in the room just for sleep it did its job i would recommend this to family and friends;4
i booked this hotel out of desparation since every other place was either booked out or selling at a ridiculous rate then i found this hotel looking at the pictures online i decided to pay for a premium room and what a difference the renovation made i got a newly renovated room that looks quaint and modern nowhere near the horrible 1970s pictures posted online the gentleman at the front desk was extremely welcoming as well and it was a pleasure speaking with him after a long trip you get what you paid for thats for sure however once they finish renovating the entire building this hotel can be a gem;4
my husband and i stayed at the new yorker for 4 days we picked it based upon location if you want walk and be close to it all this the location check in was quick and easy the rooms are tiny and dated im not sure if all the rooms are like that or if some have been renovated i would ask next time when booking the bathroom is also tiny and needs to be updated but i have to say everything was super clean we would probably return as you cant beat this location;4
the hotel has very good sevice and is well located if youre interested in visiting the universal studios park or hollywood if you feel like eating out you can go to the universal studios citywalk which is open to public you dont have to pay the park entrance to go there and youll find nice options for a meal;4
recommended by several friends the new yorker is centrally located and convenient the room was small for 4 of us but clean and everything worked the hotel is secure and the staff are careful only to allow guests upstairs would have liked to have gone to the 20th floor to observe the city but it was closed during our visit;4
i booked this trip for my daughterâs 18th birthday present before we arrived i e mailed the hotel to ask if we could have a room with a view as it was a special occasion we arrived around 9pm ny time and were promptly checked in the room although small had a nice view of maddison square gardens and was on the 25th floor i wasnât bothered by the size of the room we only showered and slept there it was clean tidy and the bed was comfy air con worked which was a god send as touching nearly 40 degrees on our visit the location is brilliant walk to time square empire state tube stations right outside too the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel as a whole very clean it is an old building but reasonably decorated we loved our time in nyc the people are so;4
i was fortunate and managed to snag a great rate but ultimately decided to stay here due to the history of the hotel if you are unfamiliar definitely recommend looking it up the hotel is currently undergoing construction on the exterior i believe which made it a little difficult to determine where to go for valet the staff is very attentive specifically the doormen they were amazing the rooms have been upgraded but the original tile in the shower and the toilet think public restroom have seen better days i had an amazing view overlooking msg talk about luck the pet fee is very reasonable 25night valet is 60night no room service but two restaurants off the lobby overall i had a really great stay cant complain near to the empire state building;4
nice clean friendly hotel modern rooms are fun and the food and bar is great this is my second time staying here and both visits were comfortable and fun for our group we all ended up eating at the restaurant in the hotel which was delicious;4
excellent rooms with very comfortable beds and its a 5 minute walk to universal studios and city walk ask for a upper room for great views of the city and the theme park parking is expensive but you save of theme park parking because you can walk over;4
we stayed there from 72327 found it to be a great location walked two short blocks to columbus circle and took the subway to many parts of manhattan as well as to brooklyn heights our room was small as are most nyc hotel rooms but it was clean and quietwe are going back in september and will probably stay there again;4
very disappointed this trip to ur hotel was to have 2 queen size beds had 2 full ones and to have a view not of the side of a building teny tiny room too small for 4 ppl couldnât pass each other in the room one had to walk and the other had to wait to get by;4
the location was perfect for our manhattan stay the e line subway was located just across the street from the hotel we mainly traveled on the e line to all of our destinations including the 911 china town the high line greenwich village and to see jazz on 50th street we encountered unnecessary problems at check in since the reservation was in my wifes name and she was not present;4
hubby and i stayed here for an overnight in nyc i was a bit nervous about a hotel so close to penn station however it worked out beautifully the building is a truly historic nyc site definitely visit the bottom level to learn more about the buildings history the art deco building has retained its style and history all the staff we dealt with were friendly our room was small but it was all we needed it was modern and clean and gave us a place to sleep at night the location worked out well for midtown activities we walked a ton while in the city and we were able to walk to everything we did from the new yorker didnt need a cab or subway for anything;4
my husband and i stayed at the hilton last weekend when we visited universal studios theme park its a fantastic hotel in a great location the room was pretty upscale we were on the 21st floor though the elevators are very slow they are working on upgrading them though and there were signs posted so we expected that overall our stay there was great and wed definitely stay there again ive only got 2 complaints and theyre pretty minor the bar area was way too hot once we got checked in we wanted to get a drink and a snack we sat at the bar but i was about to combust i was so hot everything else there was great my only other complaint is that the toilet paper seemed like it was about 1 step from sand paper im not joking at all so other than those 2;4
we had a small cabin room and believe me it is small the location is great shared bathroom always clean and tidy if you want to shower and sleep and not pay expensive hotel prices this is your place loved the history of the titanic and to still see parts of the arch to terminal was amazing just a few metres from the hotel we was there september and it was warm after a long day sitting in the room wasnt good we grabbed some beers and sat along the hudson watching day turn to night and seeing cruise ships and boats sail pass we loved it;4
if youre looking for a typical hotel experience stay somewhere else at the jane you take the good with the badodd and you wind up with a few newyork stories along he way the hotel is old has been rescued and renovated and comes complete with some of the prereno occupants who reside in unrenovated rooms that dot each floorit can get funky in there but hey theyre just people the halls reminded me of the hotel in bartonfink with 100 less satanic johngoodman these things shouldnt scare you off and if they do you should probably stay elsewhere the rooms are incredibly small but ingeniously laid out to accommodate you and your luggage wifi was virtually nonexistent in rooms ive stayed in the air conditioner is housed in an ornamental box that prevents;4
sure the rooms are a bit run down and the carpet is worn but the price is very good and the staff was friendly and extra helpful i stayed here 3 nights along with a friend we each had our own room my friend originally planned to only stay for 2 nights when he requested to keep his room for a 3rd night he learned the hotel was fully booked but the nice woman at the front desk offered to upgrade my room to a suite where we both could stay the suite was nothing special it was a little larger with one bed and a couch with a pull out bed but she did not charge us any extra for the upgrade i donât know the history of the building but it is a nice older hotel with a lot of nice features the lobby is quite classy with a fire place and stone lions outside for manhattan;4
just got back from a 9 day trip to california based on a recommendation from a friend in la we chose the hilton universal city for our la baseeven though we never even went to universal studios aside from citywalk 2 nights most of the things we needed to do were in the north hollywoodhollywood area and the hotel couldnt have been more convenient it also provided very easy freeway access to santa monica and other side trips the hotel staff was notably friendly courteous and helpful special shout out to stuart at the front desk who was wonderful and handled a couple of minor issues promptly and professionally the hotel itself is beautiful and the guest rooms are very attractive contemporary and clean the beds were amazingly comfortable if it had been;4
the new yorker hotel is beautiful the lobby is comfortable the staff is accommodating and helped us with our reservation finding theater tickets getting taxis and finding our way around the city our room was comfortable and beautiful but very tiny the queen sized bed took up most of the space so there was very little room for walking around or storing our luggage both restaurants had great food and amazing service we enjoyed our stay;4
theres nothing quite the location of this hotel while the amenities are a bit worn down showers are old elevators are slow everything is just near this one a stones throw away from convenience stores a subway stop and a few blocks away from times square if you get a room of a high floor as well youll be given such an amazing view;4
wonderful location for those like me who love the opera also convenient to the subway for those like me who arent keen on taxis my room was very quiet and comfortable concierge helpful breakfast in a bright and delightful space with excellent buffet;4
this location was great for visiting all of midtown we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in 30 minutes or less its worth it to pay for the upgraded rooms on the higher levels with views of empire state building a couple issues were service was spotty from the front desk misinformed and lied to on multiple occasions that was made up for by the superb management who did everything in there power to make it right;4
perfect location and very nice personel great areas to relax and the pool deck was so nice the pool was very small but the pool deck was fantastic the sofa area in the lobby and bar and m was very cozy snd relaxing great for all age groups;4
we stayed at this hotel due to the location and werent disappointed we took advantage of the shuttle and the pool which had just been refurbished it included a nice bar area with snacks which was an added bonus while the kids swam it was a nice way to relax and round out a very busy day in la the rooms are up to hilton standards as well as the food i agree with a few of the reviews noting the cost of parking and food was a bit pricey but youre paying for the convenience also i would recommend this hotel for others wanting to go to universal city or explore la for a weekend;4
a decent budget hotel that is perfect for student trips rooms are a bit on the hot side but clean and safe i took 25 students from the uk in april 2014 and saw no evidence of the horror stories that are all over this website;4
the best feature of this hotel is its location right next to lincoln center our room was small and gloomy although it was called a superior room we heard intermittent every 5 of 10 minutes scraping and scratching noises coming from behind one wall we reported this to a staff member but it continued through our our stay including all night the hangars in the closet were hung about 7 feet from the floor my 55 wife had to stand on tiptoes to reach them what do short people do when i got home i noticed my room was labeled a package but there was nothing in the package but the room as far as i could tell no free wii fi or any extras;4
i traveled to ny with my husband and my son in june 2011 we booked a room here for 1 week the hotel was very basic there were 2 double beds and a tv with cable the room was very small it has air conditioner the location was very convenient you can walk to all the affordable restaurants in chinatown little itaty is only a couple of blocks away subway station is only a block walk we were out all day and only came back to sleep it was quite safe even at night you can ask the front clerk for car service to the airport if needed we took a taxi from jfk airport to the hotel if you like to go out at night there were lots of bars that are within walking distance internet service was provided;4
just got back from a 5 night stay at the empire hotel in febrooms were quite small but i hear this is pretty standard in new yorkthey did how ever have everything u need for a roomgreat storage plenty hanger spacegood stocked mini bardresserlarge mirrordouble showerbathroom miniaturesand really comfy bed etcall the nice little things that make a difference in a room i thinkrooms were cleaned beds made fresh towels every day on returning to the roomwe arrived late and after delays decided to use room service which was quick but very pricey30 for the smallest lobster rollshould maybe be lowered a bitbut food was quick and of a good standardlobby was beautiful with two good barsone up one downconcierge was very helpfulwould make any reservations and direct;4
the location is great for those heading to universal studios and the rooms are clean and comfortable wifi was decent quality as well but is only free to hhonors members who booked their hotel stay directly through hiltonâs website self parking in their garage was 28day which seems like a ripoff of course they will argue that it is marketrate pricing nice and comfortable place to stay but on the higherend of pricing;4
all good except flies on food and food area need to be controlled by placing a screen curtain around food area we found dead fly on the cake for second time we have stayed there when we travelled to los angles wifi sucks;4
very nice hotel good location subway just 1 block 12 awaynot many places to eat around but everything is close when you ride the subsmall rooms but clean nice people it does not incl breakfast and internet has a rate but at the corner you have a deli that has wireless for free it is just across the central park;4
i write this review about hugo who is not only an excellent cook but also a nice person who prepared my breakfast just the way i wanted felt like home thanks hugo once again i look forward to come again;4
we arrived in marrakech after a long journey from the states the driver was waiting at the airport and the guys with the luggage trolly were waiting at the small door the hostess was gracious admittedly the check in could have been quicker but i may have been punchy from travel and hunger we ate in the restaurant the first night and the food was wonderful we had one incident and it was of no fault to the staff the hotel is not truly nonsmoking guests are allowed to smoke anywhere the courtyard may be open the first night a man smoked in the restaurant it is not open and the 2nd night a guest smoked in the courtyard which sat below our window when we asked the night clerk about the smoking she asked the guest to not smoke the guest came upstairs and smoked;4
stayed here for a week with my brother huge room with two double beds own shower room balcony tv etc only slight disappointment was no nintendo console as advertised relatively quiet area and very close to the metro and the bus stops area isnt too bad no real trouble that i noticed but we werent out after 8pm at night good selection at breakfast with eggs and waffles made to order also cereal drinks and bagles pastries etc more than enough to get you going for the day and saved us the hassle of somewhere to eat great value considering where it is only 15 minutes away from hollywood on the train and would stay again if i was going to la only reason the sleep quality is so low is because i struggle badly with jet lag;4
we stayed one night which included breakfast and club room access front desk was efficient and welcoming we were very satisfied with the breakfast buffet and evening cocktails and dessert at the club room the deserts were not refilled so first come first served same with afternoon snacks however service was friendly and very attentive the room was spacious clean and comfy the view was unexciting overlooking a pool and airport parking lot the parking garage is shared with lax travelers so it was ridiculously full when we arrived if you dont take the car out you can pay the private garage rate 22day if you go in and out you can get hotel validation and its around 35day very convenient for lax access;4
after reading some of the reviews on here my husband were hesitant to make reservations but it was in our budget we arrived late at night and was nicely greeted by the desk clerk he gave us specific instructions on how to find our room and we did its not a fancy place it is old but if you are traveling on a budget and would rather spend money on food shows shopping it is well worth it we had daily maid service the bed was decent the bathrooms were clean contrary to some postings and we saw no sign of bugs or anything nasty the only complaint i could think of making is that the building was hot the heater was constantly onbut we were on the second floor and just kept our window cracked outside noise not really its on a residentail street the;4
the new yorker is not only clean convenient and charming it is a very affordable hotel we loved the artdeco ambiance we would definitely stay there again i recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay when in nyc;4
stayed over stpatricks day weekend rooms were a little on the small side but to be expected in nyc rooms were clean enough but didnt get the sheets changed the whole four nights not sure if this is standard procedure staff were great especially jeff thanks for all your advice and recommendations amazing location hotel is 5 mins walk to times square and in close proximity to all the theatres too good value for money and would return if coming for another short break;4
we stayed in this hotel for 3 nights to end our usa trip our room was a king corner room with fold out sofa most rooms over the 10th floor would have great views we were only on 7th and could see universal studios but only partially room was a good size and beds were comfortable the bathroom did not have a bath but this did not bother us as we would not use anyway the actual room was huge with lots of mirrors the outside pool area was really nice and the pool was a good temperature the hotel is a short 5 minute walk from universal studios and the citywalk shops which had different options for food and shopping we enjoyed our stay at this hotel thanks hilton;4
the empire hotel is a charming boutique style hotel the lobby bar is intimate and has a sexy feel to it just a mere 5 minute walk to central park the rooftop bar is fantastic the rooms are unique but a tad on the smaller side however realize it is nyc all in all would recommend staying at this hotel;4
nice hotel rooms are very outdated need some painting and fixing here and thereâ¦ perfect location beautiful lobby staff is friendly super nice and helpful food is good too our family room didnât have coffee maker which is very inconvenient;4
great luxurious hotel in a great location friendly and helpful reception staff who made our visit go with ease rooms are nice and modern and feel luxurious had a bad view in the room and not a lot of natural light in the room but besides that the room was clean and spacious loved the decor amenities are extortionate 8 dollars for bottled water and a ridiculously overpriced minibar also never stayed in a hotel which charges for tea and coffee in the room as tea drinking brits this was heartbreaking ð was cheaper to go to starbucks next door but we ended up buying tea bags and milk from a local supermarket they also charged for wifi in the room at 10 a day whilst there was free wifi in the lobby it was kind of inconvenient was cheaper to buy a us lyca sim;4
we were surprised buy the tiny tiny size of the room i also missed not having a coffee service in the room we were frustrated that there were so few ice machines on such a big property and many were not working;4
spacious lobby topnotch security very gracious staff i liked that you had to show room key to get access to elevators room was tastefully appointed closet outstanding bar in the basement nice location walkable to either penn station or hudson yards;4
as other reviewers have mentioned this is a wonderful riad beautifully restored with amazing staff and if tripadvisor allowed 45 stars thats what i would have given on the plus side the food was great and plentiful the staff were amazingly helpful and nothing was too much trouble including escorting you to and from wherever you wanted to go they also lend you a mobile phone in case you get lost or need any help night or day the only tiny downsides firstly location almost anywhere worth seeing in marrakech is at least a mile walk away even the taxis are a ten minute walk this means you cant easily pop back for something and you have to plan your days secondly theres a real lack of information about the riads facilities there is a spa but no;4
it continues to amaze me that the new yorker an aging hotel of days gone by of nikola tesla fame is still doing well in the city that doesnt sleep with so many other options for quality hotels well i can tell you that my recent stay was a very good one not being in the area for 2 plus years for a trade show the location to many key sites is key only thing that was missed was complimentary water in the past at checkin i would have given it 5 stars but the little things still mean the most;4
the location is very good if you want to be close to universal the staff are good and the food is excellent the buffet was awesome and i wish i had breakfast there since they serve a japanese style menu pool is outdoors and heated good till midnight 10 min easy walk to universal peteâs coffee is inside the hotel and the woman that served me twice each morning was a for service and friendliness definitely will be back;4
the hotel met our expectations and it was a perfect location for us traveling from pennsylvania station early next day the room was a bit small but it had all we needed a comfortable bed i like a bed with a hard mattress the bathroom was small but clean and with a very nice complementary body lotion;4
had a great stay at the empire hotel yes the room was clean and decor good air conditioning much needed the mini bar was very expensive so used the fridge for our own supplies view over dante park and the lincoln centre great well positioned for getting around new york friendly staff and overall i would stay here again;4
conveniently close to several subway lines the internet was fast enough to stream tv and get work done but it isnt free unless you book a particular deal they offer breakfast for a cost and free coffee both of which i didnt try elevators are slow but there are three so the wait wasnt horribly long id stay here again;4
the hilton was comfortable standard large hotel with all the comforts of a big hilton hotel older style but comfortable rooms and nice pool area very easy walk to universal and the freehotel shuttle comes regularly the breakfast buffet had an excellent choice and was good value;4
having read a lot of reviews about the hotel and the roomsizes i was happy to find that my room was larger than id imagined still a small room but i stayed comfortably in there for 7 nights i arrived rather late and checked in around 1am wasnt a problem what so ever was a huge line outside of people going to the club but there was no problem walking past them hotel rather close to the subway 14st 8ave with the e and the a going straight out to jfk airport only issue i had with the hotel honestly were the other guests when sharing a bathroom with others youd think that people would hurry up for a bit one dude showered for a staggering 40min showers were clean but a bit beaten up nothing that stopped me from getting clean however will not recommend the in;4
hotel was great we enjoyed the historical exhibit that celebrated the hotels 90th anniversary the only problem we had was the incredibly loud noise coming from a construction project on the corner of 34th st and 8th ave although we were on an upper floor we could still hear the sounds of cutting and drilling the city shouldnt allow these construction projects to go on so late at night;4
there is so much to love about the new yorker from its location to the tick tok diner to the quality of their rooms this is one of our favourite places to stay in ny it is so easy to get around in ny using the new yorker as your base either walking or taking the subway is a breeze i especially like how close this is to the high line;4
i was really worried about staying here since i only read the reviews after paying for the room we got a room on the ground floor with courtyard balcony we didnt have any sound disturbance at all during our stay all the towels were changed frequently and room was always cleaned breakfast ok there was enough choice of bagels croissants rolls cereals freshly prepared waffles fruit toast i know that you have to 9 per day for car parking but this in line or less than other hotels i called the staff seemed ok and there is internet access available for a small fee i thought this place was alright to stay at;4
we had an amazing room massive especially for ny large plasma sofa massive bed and great wet room only down side was the no change bar and a birthday card â£10 note went missing not too bad i snaffled the pringles and the mini bar to make up for it;4
my wife and i truly enjoyed our stay at the jane the bunk bed rooms were extremely small but you just cant beat the price also it is situated in the meatpacking district which is one of my favourite neighbourhoods definitely a must for travellers on a budget;4
the hotel is in the heart of the manhattan district and close to broadway the staff are very friendly and cannot do enough for you especially jeff who helped me with with a few minor teething problems with the room the room i stayed in was an average size but clean had working ac and a great shower overall i would highly recommend this hotel without reservation if youre ever in manhattan;4
i stayed at hotel hollywood with my best friend we were there for 8 nights we were lucky enough to score an amazing deal which was stay for longer than 5 nights and get 50 off if youre from overseas so it ended up being amazing value but even so the hotel was amazing clean great breakfast every morning definitely worth full price the only minuscule thing would be the location its not really walking distance to many places but with that said its super easy to get a cabbusshuttle which the staff were more than happy to help with;4
very well located opposite penn station and times square we were lucky to get a suite on the 38th floor with a great view leaving cases was a problem with a very long line of quests trying to leave their case and it cost 2 each case be aware of the daily charge never come across this before lots of places to eat just down the road;4
my wife and i spent 4 nights in this hotel as part of our 2 weeks honeymoon the hotel is in very good locationie just 2 mins walk to the vermontsta monica station and about 10 mins drive to hollywood boulevard the staffs were friendly and breakfast was included though food is average they have a gym outdoor pool laundry and free wireless internet which was very good room is small but ok for couples its very clean when we checked in and bed was comfy overall this was a good hotel to stay at if your on budget alex from nz;4
stayed here whilst visiting universal studios short 10 minute walk to the studios from the hotel standard room was comfortable clean and spacious however is in need of some modernisation the lifts were getting modernised during our stay we didnât include any meals into our stay but had to walk through the huge buffet every time you wanted to leave the hotel and on our arrival it wasnât ideal trying to navigate your way through the crowds for dinner with our suitcase we used the underground parking facilities which were easy also 1015 minute walk to a train station which we took into hollywood;4
excellent hotel more lifts than ever previously witnessed and all working very efficiently staff marvellous restaurant and diner in site although independent to hotel perfectly placed for madison square garden and empire state building;4
great location a stones throw from the empire state building loads of art deco charm in the rooms lobby lifts etc tick tock diner open 24 hours a bit pricey but service rapid hotel staff very charming and friendly rooms small but nicely styled a better bet for breakfast is the small stall in the lobby selling fresh pastries and coffee guy selling excursions on the info desk is excellent like an extra from the sopranos recommended if you want memories of the right kind;4
we stayed at the jane for four nights in november in a captains suite its a fantastic hotel amazing decor stag heads in the lobby peacock print fabric lined walls and gorgeous bellhops who were always available to help unload my armfulls of shopping an easy walk to fabulous restaurants pastis the standard spice market and of course cafe gitane and the beautiful west villagechelsea districts does has a slightly spooky aura especially in the corridors at night but do stay here its well worth the goose bumps;4
my friend and i went to nyc the wyndham new yorker was a fine place to stay it has some of the old character as it was built in 1929 refurbished tastefully it has a 247 restaurant the ticktock connected for easy access with reasonable prices some of you may like big tall hotels and this one was good dont get me wrong just remember that you wait by the elevators for your ride and you pick up others along the way down and upso when you forget to bring your gloves you go all the way back through the wait to get them the service was good the front desk helped us get a much needed cork screwno problem our room had a great view of the empire state building it was a good place to stay to save money you can go directly to the hop on hop off bus tour folks;4
the park west hotel or astor on the park is in an excellent location with one of the best views of nyc the west side of north central park right in front the hotel is also very close to the 103 st and the cathedral pkwy subway metro stations the price was worth it the rooms are small but comfortable and with modern features and design the staff was nice and friendly at all times we arrived really early in the morning and we stopped by to leave our luggage before checkin time adam helped us later with an about onehour early checkin our only comment is the general cleanliness of the hotel reception and breakfast area we have no complaint with the room neither the floor corridor where we stayed the first thing you notice arriving at the hotel is the dusty and;4
my husband and i just got back from five nights at this hotel ill first say that this area is a bit questionable in some parts but near the hotel it was fine and we had no problem we picked this hotel based on its location as its very close to the kaiser permanente hospital on sunset where my father in law was having surgery so for us it was perfect the hotel is located on a busy city street so the driveway is small and cramped and very steep a friend picked us up and dropped us off which was good as another car had also pulled up and had we needed to stop there for very long it would have been a problem there is a gated parking lot with an attendant that i believe is around 17 a day we didnt need that and i am happy to say we didnt have to pay that fee;4
stayed for four nights with family 2 adults 2 children aged 12 and 7 during summer 2006 the location is great for universal studios and city walk also for hollywood bowl and boulevard 5 minutes by car and the hotel is sparkling clean and modern our main problem was that we arrived at 9pm after an exhausting trip from london and were given a room that wasnt made up this was quickly sorted out with the management however and we ended up in a large room on the 15th floor with two double beds and a great view to the north over universal studios the room was plenty large enough for a family of four and the bathroom clean and modern with everything you need we took breakfast every morning in the excellent restaurant the service was first class and the buffet breakfast;4
great location all staff were very friendly and helpful easy check in and out would like mini fridge in room had a great view of the city from our room beds comfortable would definitely stay here again;4
stayed here for my daughters graduation celebrations room was clean and beds comfortable the room was quite narrow but long but had everything we needed except a view we were looking at a brick wall we travelled september 2018 dropdown wont allow this far back;4
visited new york for the first time from 4th7th feb and stayed in the new yorker the hotel is well placed for exploring midtown as its next to madison square garden and close enough to times square and the empire state building we were on the 7th floor in a newly refurbished room which was clean enough and had coffee making facilities however the bathroom was tiny we also had a great view of the empire state building liked the hotel and for our budget it was fine but would maybe try another hotel next time;4
nice hotel next to a subway station clean rooms with big amazing and relaxing beds wifi signal is strong the restaurant of the hotel for breakfast or lunchdinner was good with a great variety of choises staff was always kind and helpful unfortunately our room was not very spacious and there was no storage fridge overall it is an economical and descent hotel close to most of the sightseeing activities of new york i definitely propose it;4
our stay at the empire hotel was good we were out most of the time so i dont have too much in the way of critique for the hotel first thing if you want a room with a view then dont book into room 105 nothing to see here folks also the aircon units outsideon this side of the hotel are very noisywe expected this after reading other reviews so we had earplugs with us and they done the trick thats about the only negatives though the beds are very comfortable the shower is superb although the floor does end up very wet because theres only half a door on the shower i found the staff to be friendly and helpful the hotels location is excellent easy walking distance to central park broadway times sq and the shops on 5th avenue would i stay there again all;4
this hotel is in a great location for the mid to mature traveller lincoln center and columbus circle are nearby there are several nice restaurants to dine at within walking distance of the empire and lets not forget a strabucks on the same block my only qualm is that the beds are not conducive to a great nights sleep my star rating goes to a lobby desk staffperson by the name of gunita she provided a level of service that left me saying thank you to her for my anniversary she sent me a note of well wishes now that isnt just customer service but 100 customer care;4
i always enjoy my stays at the hyatt this hotel is very nice lively bar seen after 7pm and great rooms the beds are okay wish the sheets were softer and pillows more fluffy the decor is really nice as well it does have an outside pool which is cool a lot of books and crannies and areas to do work individually or large groups;4
stayed one night while we were visiting universal studios a totally convenient hotel walking distance and plenty of parking although parking is 28night ouch the hotel is completely modern and the rooms have plenty of fancy amenities and usb for charging electronics the hostess and staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful the only complaint i would have is limited places to dine on site and the restaurant closed at 9pm on a thursday night leaving us nothing to eat until the morning construction is active right now at the hotel adjacent to the lobby although it was quiet at night it was a tad loud and messy downstairs;4
it was a kind of apartment actuallythey do not clean the room and change the sheets everydayas far as i remember if you request they give you new sheets evey 3 dayswe have stayed for seven nights with 11 months baby we have everthing in the kitchen a kettle a cooker a microwave a little refrigerator so it want a matter perapere to her baby foof in the middle of the nightalso there were tv and dvd player in the room location is great near the broadway st and 2 minutes to a bigcentral metro station so it was easy to go everywhere with a little baby it is a fact that they offer only clean room not so muh serviceour flight was in the evening and they requested from us an extra money to keep our luggages for a few hours after check out anyway i plan to stay in woogo;4
after reading some of the negative reviews about this hotel i was pleasantly surprised the location is amazing a few minutes from penn station and an easy 10 minutes walk from times square the rooms were comfortable with an iron ironing board safe and hair dryer the only reason not given 5 as the wardrobe space was extremely limited this didnt effect us but could be a problem for some visitors also had a place to leave bags until our flight 2 per case would definitely recommend;4
for an older hotel we had a great stay it is right downtown and the beds are excellent the room size was ample compared to newer hotels we have stayed in watch out for the internet and gym they charge you;4
the service is always excellent the staff is super friendly and helpful the location is fabulous great restaurants and shopping nearby and a short walk to my office i always stay in the junior suite and have enjoyed occasionally an upgrade to the corner suite or the one bedroom suite beautiful views of lincoln center the beds are so comfortable but more attention should be given to the rooms;4
hotel location is excelent just at a metro exit staff is very kind and efficient the room furniture should be upgraded hotel restaurants are very different from each other from the expensive one to a regular price in other;4
this year i decided to give my bride a weekend in nyc for christmas i selected the hotel because it was about a block from penn station arriving around 4 pm on friday we were warmly greeted by krystal sp iâd paid for a standard queen size room much to our delight she put us in a room on the 40th floor facing the empire state building to us it was a suite with a bar sink doors to the bedroom living room two tvs the place is rich in history built around 1930 be sure to go down to the basement to see the old literature and news features tesla lived there although i detest the taxlike âfacility feesâ in an expensive city the unexpected upgrade was greatly appreciated floors 2140 have their own elevators we never had to wait more than 12;4
we booked the hotel thru travelchannelde price was 153 per night which is a bargain compared to hotels like the pennsilvania or other old places for the first night we had a very tiny room with window to the backyard but upon request room was changed the next day to a bigger room with park view both rooms and bathrooms very very clean tv was not working properly but they are working to improve the system and there is more things to do in nyc than watching television staff was very attentive and helpful we would always go back there;4
the front desk and all other personnel were wonderful and i could put up with the small room however the noise was unbearable it sounded like a truck was driving into your room so i had to buy earplugs the owner should invest in new windows to address this it is a very well run hotel but the noise ruins the experience;4
i was a little skeptical about staying here because of the bad reviews however my friends and i came prepared for the bed bugs we bought bed bug spray and lysol and sprayed the room and bathroom as soon as we checked in and didnt have a problem the room was more spacious than i thought there were 3 of us so we got the room with 1 full and 1 twin the front desk workers were so nice we stayed 5 nights and 4 days the hotel is less than a block from the nearest subway so it was very convenient for travel to other areas we were on the d train so much lol there is also a groceryconvenience store right across the street from the hotel with it being in chinatown you are very close to canal delancey and mott streets which are known for great shopping you are also;4
stayed for a meeting and was offered a room with a view on the phone when i arrived the view turned out to be straight down 34th street to the empire state building so i could hardly complain the room itself was a bit small not japanese hotel small but fully appointed with closet desk dressertv and multiple plugs for all my devices the bathroom was fairly spacious and clean although the shower was a little confusing separate taps for tubshower and hotcold so four in all and one of the bolts on the toilet seemed to be a little bit loose just minor things sometimes the room was a little mustysmelling when i came back in the evening but this was easily cleared up by turning on the ac the building itself is a nice 40story art deco hotel with quite a;4
easy location for walking times square etc grand central station and shops clean rooms bathroom could do with a update healpfull staff who pointed us in the right direction for a fantastic meal at chans pipe house expensive but worth every dollar also opposite the madison square gardens;4
visited here on a two day stopover in la it is just a 10 minute stroll right to the entrance to the park but there is also a shuttle bus if you are just too tired at the end of the day or have small children in tow whats more the hop on hop off bus stops right at the hotel entrance so you can access the rest of la santa monica and venice beach without driving or taking cabs very expensive hotel is the standard expected of a hilton excellent amenities and good staff definitely the pick of hotels at universal city;4
hotel staff was nice and courteous rooms were decent sized and clean definitely in a great location to everything an employee mr jeffrey banks was extremely helpful and made our stay that much better will definitely stay here again on our next visit go knicks;4
this was my second stay here as solid an experience as the first time and i usually avoid airport hotels will stay again so convenient to the airporta ten minute walk i can get tofrom lax faster than taking a taxi;4
i stayed here for 5 nights with my sister very impressed with the service and the room overall excellent wifi in the rooms which is included we had a view of the empire state building from our room which was brilliant if you are expecting 5 then this place isnât for you as the rooms could do with a lick of paint however the rooms are comfortable and the beds are good everything is clean and the maids come in daily to change sheets and towels the bath and shower could be better the television picture was fuzzy the lift could also do with modernising overall for the price i would stay here again and the service overall was lovely;4
i enjoyed staying here the room was clean comfortable and well fitted out the staff were terrific my daughter and i arrived early after a 14 hour flight from australia and the staff were very understnading and arranged for us to check in early at no extra cost the hyatt is within alking distance to lax and the local shops etc as we were attending a convention being held at the hyatt over the weekend the hotel was very busy but the staff were still extremely helpful and nothing seemed an inconvience the only disappointment i have is i was quoted 281 us per night but not told of fees and charges eg occupancy tax assessment fee which then added another 40us per night when traveling on a budget these costs can make a difference but in saying that the overall stay was;4
the hotel was nice and the rooms were clean they were very small and there as an extra charge for everything however the cost made up for a great room in a great part of town free access to the club upstairs with no wait in line was a nice added benefit especially if you want to hit a real new york club but maybe wouldnt go seek it out on your own;4
stayed for 3 nights over a weekend the rooms were a bit small mohammed on the check in desk was excellent helped out with all our questions made a big difference to our hotel experience good location for those who want to get about both ends of manhatten;4
i cannot complain about the hotel in anyway except the lack of free wifi in the room and to buy 24 hours worth was 25 dollars surely free wifi is pretty standard in most hotels by now oh er wise i cannot fault it the location was wonderfully close to central park and only a 15 min walk from times square the concierge was amazing loved feeling so very important having our luggage taken to the room etc the desk staff were also very friendly and didnt hesitate to find it the weather for us when we asked we didnt pay for the wifi the in room dining and bar are certainly not cheap going up to 350 dollars for a bottle of whiskey but they have no problem with you taking your own food and drink to the room which we did take snacks etc oh and dont forget to put the;4
the hotel itself is okay very much a business hotel but you cannot beat the convenience if you are visiting universal studios we were checked in by the manager and he had excellent service and was very accommodating i would stay here again if visiting the parks;4
this is a wonderful hotel the rooms are very big with a mini fridge great food outdoor pool and location is great short walk to universal citywalk and studios the little cafe is also very good the only thing bad is that our room flooded the toilet was not working properly and water just keeped coming out called the front desk about 10 times and they did not seem to understand what was going on after about a half hour they came the water was all the way to the beds they moved us to the room under the room that flooded and it was leaking so we moved across the hall other then our room flooding i would go back and recommened;4
the location of this hotel near times square and the theatre district was perfect the staff was friendly and helpful right from the start of our visit jeff one of the doormen went out of his way to help us with directions and arranged for a ride to the airport at the end of our visit that was cheaper than uber the only issue that we had with the hotel was their bathrooms our bathroom had a toilet that was installed too close to the sink to be able to use it comfortably their bathroom off of the lobby needs some work as well the sink in the bathroom was slanted on the sides which makes sitting anything on it almost impossible the bathroom issues can be overlooked because of their staff and the location they do need to fix their exterior entrance lights as;4
we have just returned from 4 nights stay here i was slightly concerned having read the previous reviews but really shouldnt have been staff were attentive friendly and helpful our shower was broke on arrival and we were moved rooms straight away with no fuss yes the courtyard view could be better but who cares youre in new york the location is perfect for exploring the city the room was spotless and we had a great sleep each night we would definitely return;4
stayed here for the teen choice awards got a king alcove room which overlooks the 101 freeway this room is roomy with a king size bed desk sofa sleeper ref coffee table flat screen and even more additional seating we housed two adults two teens and a five year old for one night and it met our needs i would say the hotel is due for a refresh as the lobby decor pays homage to the 80s we came on a sunday afternoon and didnt know that this was the place for all you can eat lobster tails crab legs and much more it looked like there were many locals that were in the know of the sunday event try it i dont think youd be disappointed we used the pool and i can see how you would want to cool off after a day in the park they have cabanas a bar and grill;4
all was good liked the blue lighting under the bed for a night lightwould like something for breakfast with out going out;4
i stayed here for a single night with my girlfriend while we were in nyc for a night this hotel was perfect for us we are both in our earlymid 20s the room is small so if space is what youre looking for this is not the place but the bathroom was great and clean an awesome shower that was big with good shower head nice comfortable king size bed and good tv we didnt spend much time in the room just pretty much to change once mid day and to sleep but it was affordable and perfect for us for a quick stay in manhattan;4
excellent location when you want to visit lincoln center theatres or opera very good fish restaurant eds chowder room standard room was too small for us we therefore we asked for an upgrade which we got;4
we stayed at the hilton for our trip to universal its ideally located so we could pop back and forth to universal with our 2day pass the lobby is striking and has a great atmosphere we had a corner room which was spacious and had a great view of the hills the staff were also very helpful and nice the only minor downside was the buffet meal we opted for looked more appetizing than it actually was theres an array of seafood as many of the dishes didnt live up to the price we were also charged for service when we were only bought a couple of drinks being a buffet we had to help ourselves to our own food however this is a great hotel if you plan on visiting universal studios;4
we stayed for a five nights with my sister on arrival the receptionist automatically upgraded us to a two double beds rooms when i mentioned my sister birthday also got upgraded to a room with a view of the empire state and crysler for free great base for travelling round new york and transfer from jfk you will need to take air train to jamaica and then lirr train to penn station runs frequently and only 12 for the journey takes about an hour to the terminal then a couple of mins walk from there good diner in the hotel which locals used as well overall great stay and would recommend;4
we chose this hotel as a part of our la tour in sept 2012 mainly due to its location the hotel is situated in the vermont ave area its 5 mins walk to the vermontsanta monica station red line as soon as you get out of the station the hotel is clearly visible when you look at your left its that close the location is safe overall but like any part of la you start seeing homeless after 8pm including the downtown area but they dont bother you from the airport its a 20 min drive in avg traffic conditions from the metro you can get to hollywood within 10 mins the rooms were spacious we were given a 2 queen bedroom we used the second one for the luggage they were comfortable and we had good nights sleep during our stay the hotel offers free wifi which is a;4
overall great hotel and the restaurant in the hotel is also great with good food we had a nice view on the 34th floor that we requested and were given so that was nice the qconsierge was polite and welcoming also loved that the hotel was near madison and many other restaurants literally right in front of madison liked visiting the rooftop bar across from the hotel also so check that out if you stay here do not go to the diner in the hotel food and service were not good at all;4
ok the rooms are really small but they tell you that up front and where else can you stay for 99 in a trendy part of manhattan there is a french bistro on site the highline park is 2 blocks away you dont need to bring a robe slippers hair dryer shampoo towels or soap great restaurants in the neighborhood the radiator pipes do make some loud noises during the night but not all the time;4
we stayed here for the first night of our 14 night coach trip and what a great choice this was we had a room at the front looking out over the lax runway but we didnt hear a thing all night the room was modern clean and big including a very large bed a table and chairs and a large couch the restaurant was expensive but there was an excellent cheaper option of a snack bar with great choices in the evening and at breakfast the reception had iced flavoured water and nutrigrain bars available free the outdoor pool was excellent on a warm la afternoon there was also a hopon hopoff bus with a stop right outside the hotel and 7 other stops en route to manhattan beach for only 5;4
very new clean and sleepfriendly great dining area and the food there is delicious and you can come down eat it until late night the starline stop is in front of the hotel the staff is really friendly and helpful breakfast is good and worth 29 if you find a hotel near lax this is it;4
i shared a bunk bed cabin with a friend tiny room so tricky with large baggage cases but clean and comfortable not much storage bar a couple of drawers so pack light the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful shared bathrooms were mostly free at all times and were kept clean great value and location was unbeatable for easy access to all parts of manhattan transport links were great from 14 street and it didnt take more than 15 or 20 minutes to get everywhere easily accessible to brooklyn also beautiful building and lounge corridor did smell of cigarette smoke though i would stay here again but in a larger room next time;4
this hotel is located right across from madison square garden excellent locale huge historic iconic building that said itâs costly 262night equates to 873 for 2 nights then hotel charged an âamenityâ fee of 45night on top of the 873 upon check in there are no amenities outside of a gym coffee pot in roomsurcharge minifrigsurcharge so a metro room comes with nothing also no room service small rooms metro room too small for 2 people no fan in bathroom dated decor bathroom needed major upgrade and was a sardine can size i was on 37th floor in room 3724 views were stellar location is stellar comfort is mediocre front desk staff was kind but only 12 people ever there for so many roomslong waits that all being said i would stay again for;4
the stay and the customer service was wonderful the only thing that could improve is people who answer the phones got hung up on had to call back not a huge issue just annoying would definitely stay there again;4
my boyfriend and stayed here for a wedding we attended the empire was in a great location for us for the wedding as well as our quick trip to the city the room and bed were comfortable my only complaints were that our rooms was dark not a lot of light in the room nor did we have a lot of natural light from outside and it was slightly noisy from other guests in the hallways overall a nice stay here in the city;4
i found the hotel to be very reasonable and very well positioned most airline crew staff use this hotel they also have free shuttles from the airport to the hotel and vice versa every 15 minutes the hotel i very clean and could have been refurbished not very long ago i highly recommend this hotel i was travelling on a business trip but i would still book this hotel even on a leisure trip;4
the days hoel broadway has been a great and convenient hotel to stay at it is in a very quie section of the upper west side but only a few yards from the subway entrance the recent renovations are fabulous and such a delight especially the new bathrooms very funcky with the white subway tile and charcoal lime stone tiles not only have the rates been good but the staff have always been very efficient and helpful and in particular jorge who has assisted me with my check in the during my three most recent stays well worh the visit;4
stop charging for wifi per device i paid for my laptop so why should i have to pay for my phone wifes phone and ipad as well so that i could face time grand daughter very upset about this and all the girl could say was sorry it just left me with an overall feeling of a bad experience with this hotel i have stayed at many hotels including the hilton and have never paid for extra devices this feels like unnecessary petty charges;4
we stayed at the hilton due to is proximity to universal studios the hotel is very close to the entrance of universal studios the first day we took the shuttle to the park and walked back it is much easier to walk we were in a full size suv that did not fit in the garage so we had to use valet for an extra 40 a night the rooms were very expensive we had two rooms on the 18th floor the rooms were nice quite and comfortable we had the brunch buffet that was excellent but again very expensive we spent a few hours at the pool the pool was nice but not as nice as other similar priced hotels ive stayed the pool has an outside bar and grill mike the bartender makes a very tasty blueberry mojito overall my family enjoyed our stay at the hilton i;4
my quilty pleasure is gossip girl so when i saw the great discount for this hotel de descision was made soon first of all de location is superb its a little bit above de crowded part of broad way central park is on walk distence beautiful to run there in the morning and the metro stops at your door so you can go whereever you want couldnt imagine a better localisation for an hotel the hotel itself has a great rooftop and a nice pool i liked the fitnesscenter as well the room was nice the bed was very good there was no view though from my room and the shower was leaking that were the only negatives;4
but theres a great hotel underneath the iconic uws sign its literally across the street from lincoln center not to mention century 21 bed bath beyond the lobby is a pretty art deco meeting place the roofdeck has a small actually tiny pool but a spectacular view of the uws the service is lovely personal you can easily walk to central park a great choice of restaurants are a stones throw away you will be pleasantly surprised;4
the check in and check out process was easy the hotel is older but clean the rooms are typically sized for new york city hotels great location next to madison square garden affordable and would recommend;4
this is a decent older full service hilton immediately adjacent to universal studios its a good property and you can walk to universal you do need to be careful on the walk though as california drivers do not generally honor crosswalks and roar around blind corners they cant see there is construction on the driveway to the hilton and part of the sidewalk is obstructed because of this and of course california drivers whip around the corner like total fools the cafe sierra has a good breakfast buffet if you are a hilton honors gold or above you can get meal vouchers for two continental breakfasts you can upgrade for 10 kids are 10 if i recall properly we didnt visit the pool as it was cold out there were lots of events going on at the hotel it was;4
my daughter and i stayed at the new yorker a wyndham hotel recently the economy nightly price was great but they do hit you with a 70 resort fee which actually bumps your nightly price up to about 150 per night i must say that i was shocked at the very small room size emphasis on small our bed was supposed to be a queen size but we are quite sure it was a full the bathroom was so small that if my husband had been with us he would not have been able to use the toilet that being said the hotel itself is truly in a great location and the staff were wonderful from the front desk for a very smooth check incheck out to the housecleaning staff who were very accommodating the room was immaculate too they have a green policy for sheets and towels the location is;4
nice hotel in a good location with restaurants attached centrally located in easy walking distance to the empire and time square the bedroom was a good size however the bathroom was small and looks like the original 1920s fittings on leaving we wanted to leave our suitcases for a few hours and was charged 20 5 per item but would use it again;4
room 2026 a little tight when two people trying to get dressed bed very comfy great shower with lots of hot water noisy at night from outside window wasnât very sound proof central location tick tick diner good value extensive menu;4
well what can i say about the hilton hotel universal city the staff were fantastic and accommodating and really helpful shout out to danny i from concierge always going the extra mile the girls by the pool were amazing made awesome cocktails accomodation the bedroom was clean the bed although they sell them as queen are actually double beds in the rest of the world but they were very comfortable thank god the rooms well kept clean and tidy be house keeping the hotel is pretty out dated and definitely needs a good make over need more food selection very limited and very expensive but seafood buffet on saturday nights is nice the instore jeweller mario is a legend and makes and sells some very nice pieces of jewellery recommend seeing him the swimming;4
everything you would expect from a four star hotel a bit on the pricey side but it will acclimate you for the living costs of la the location is great took a shuttle directly there from the airport waited about 10 min and got there in like 510 min there is a boa nearby if banking needs to be done and the hotel serves as a good base to explore dtla the room was immaculately clean and the simple modern decor made it a welcome retreat the club lounge was cozy but quiet providing a much needed rest for any weary traveler overall the hotel serves as a good resting spot and a transition point for those coming from abroad welcome to la;4
hilton is a hilton hotel and this was no exception i always good excellent service at the hiltons good location good food excellent staff clean and secuire what else do you need at the hotel will come back again;4
very nice hotel in a very great location rooms are small but very nice and useful the staff is very nice friendly and helpful especially the concierge we loved it and would come back central park and times square are just a few blocks away we got fresh apples every day they were placed on the counter what a nice idea thank you;4
good cost effective hotel to base yourself for exploring hollywood stayed 5 nights 2 x rooms family of four location not great area but metro a block away and uber 10 to universal and west hollywood included breakfasts were great but no room service or food otherwise courtyard bar wasnt open at all during our stay rooms good size and well cleaned showers a little dated rooms onto courtyard the pick courtyard tops for a beverage pool was great for cool down but the best thing was the great staff big ups to cecile jess giselle and brian in front office great breakfasts to start the day from hugo and juan and entertaining chats with michael in the gift shop wont hesitate to return;4
overall this hotel is pretty good the location is great if wanting to see the sights or other cities due to its close location to penn station times square is only about 15 mins walk away the rooms are all clean and have an art deco charm british traveller be warned the hotel will add an extra 25 a day for facility charges which may not be used this was not explained clearly on checking in i think the management should review this policy;4
as the title sayslocation this is on the west side near the river our room had an amazing view and we even brought back breakfast to eat in our room at the little table by the window so we could enjoy the view if you are looking for a swanky hotel this isnt for you this place is comfortable and has a down home feeling the neighborhood is swanky and you are only a few blocks from some amazing restaurants and the highline the bellhops have hats like back in the dayreally really cool there were really only 2 negatives to my staybesides not getting the captains room with the private balcony to which the hotel replied they were sold out ok but it was requested when i made the reservation and i called twice before checking in to make sure i would get the;4
we booked this hotel last minute not really sure what we will get for the price we were actually pleasantly surprised we walked into the lobby and it was modern and clean the hotel decided to upgrade us as we had booked the hotel thru a hotel app and did not have the option to choose a room type we were pleasantly surprised again at how spacious the room was for a new york city hotel it was nicely appointed the bed was comfortable it had plenty of pillows the bathroom was modern and clean and had a nice big shower with great water pressure we will definitely stay here again;4
this was our second stay at the ameritania having stayed there for two weeks at christmas 2016 why do you come back because you are happy to do so this hotel is in a wonderful location adjacent to broadway and an easy walk to times square or central park in the other direction the subway is nearby and thereâs a great deli for cheap breakfasts or meals just down the road the rooms are comfortable although ours was a little noisy this time being on the front of the building well thatâs new york anyway isnât it noisy 247 i did wonder if the window was double glazed though apart from the fabulous location what makes this place special for us is the staff tiffany on reception was very pleasant she helped us out with any questions we had with regard to;4
hotel is very convenient to many attractions best water pressure i have ever experienced in a hotel daily housekeeping and security check in which i was expecting so clean and safe housekeeping very prompt requested a coffee maker for our room and was probably there in 15 mins there was no refrigerator in my room only downfall because we brought stuff that need refrigeration and couldnât bring leftovers back to the room;4
he hotel is perfect located for your visit to the universal studios la the rooms are clean and the infrastructure is old but still comfortable the restaurant and the bar are ok but you have the smell of the cuisine all over the restaurant and the bar good place to stay for a weekend;4
great location was convenient to every where we wanted to go either via lyft or subway the rooms are in decent shape and the staff is friendly in a ny kind of way only downfall is that the pool is way smaller than depicted on line and the roof top bar seems to gear more toward outside guest than hotel guest but otherwise great place to stay;4
this part of 8th avenue is not the best but this hotel is an iconic part of nyc history nicollo tesla lived here and died here i believe jfk was also a guest here modern day i think its a little overpriced for the area of the city its inbut if you are looking to be close to time square madison square garden and the empire stare building this location really cant be beat just be street smart even more than usual when walking to and from this hotel the restaurant in the lobby is amazing and open all night i believe i recommended this hotel to my dad and he also liked it;4
we stayed at empire hotel nyc for my 30th birthday we had booked a double room however upon arrival jerry the hotel receptionist who was booking us in informed us that we had been upgraded to a kingsize room as a gesture from the hotel this was very pleasing they also gave us free wifi access for our room during our stay at the hotel jerry was very friendly welcoming and professional the room itself wasnt huge but we didnt go to new york to spend alot of time in our room it was ideal for what we wanted it for the room was well presented and clean our room was cleaned and reset daily to a good standard it had a powerful and hot shower which is a must for myself the hotel door staff are very friendly always happy to help and start your day with a smile which is;4
this hotel is perfectly placed to see everything you nyc we had 3 full days and managed to do everything we wanted to we booked into a metro double which had two bathrooms lovely big room and comfy beds downside was that it was dark the windows looked into the building next door the next day i spoke to linda on front desk who was lovely and super helpful and upgraded at an extra cost although she got me a good rate to an executive double with a view on the 30th floor great view and really nice newly renovated room i would definitely recommend upgrading to a view advantage with the exec room was that we got a coffee machine definite bonus as they dont come as standard all of the staff were super friendly and a big shout out to john who organised our;4
i enjoyed my stay at days inn on broadway especially because of the location but also due to a reasonable price compared to other ny hotels of this standard lift service was poor during my stay with only one lift operating my room 811 had a strange smell mould smoke and i was unable to let in some fresh air through the window i did not report this to the front desk im quite positive they would have helped me had i reported it room and the common areas were clean and nice very helpful concierge helped me get a taxi to the airport on very short notice thank you all;4
this place was perfect for us we were in a neighborhood location near where we needed to be not far from subway many restaurants grocer etc our room was very old spacious and clean we could not hear our neighbors the busy street nearby was white noise as no sirens we had a fabulous view of hudson to west and sunset air conditioning worked fine but outside temperature was mild no coffee pot or microwave in our room unfortunately refrigerator was full of mini bar pricey stuff unfortunately elevator slow people nice limited cafe on main floor priced very well for manhattan we shall return;4

we had a great stay at the empire hotel in may for 2 nights we had a lovely junior suite on the 10th floor and it was an l shaped room with bed on one end and sofa in the other we had a good view of lincoln center on one side and normal busy nyc streets on the other with hint of park on the other room was nicely decorated and bed was very comfortable bathroom was nice size and the shower area may need to be freshen up but overall it was fine housekeeping was great and we did not have any problems with towels like other reviewers the staff at the front desk were very friendly and efficient aretha checked us in and victor who renewed our key card after we left the roof bar in the early hours was still there at noon and checked us out i hope he has managed to get the;4

great location nice staff roof area was disappointing the front desk said it was open and when we got up there there was no water in it wanted to go up later and was told you must be 21 kids were welcome this just isnt a place you will hang at the pool;4
this hotel in a great location for exploring the city literally 2 min walk to the metro and 2 min walk to central park the hotel is very contemporary the rooms were spacious huge beds and very clean and modern bathroom some parts of the room needed a lick of paint but nothing urgent we did not have a good view from our room apart from the air conditioning units if you want a decent view ask for the front of the building very friendly staff and very helpful;4
just a block from msg penn station and walking distance to time square easy access to subway and many places to eat and see the price was reasonable for nyc had been asked several times to see room pass by security before entering elevators at first it was annoying but then my gf commented on how safe this made her feel i was happy to fish the room key out after that the shower pressure was incredible clean comfortable bed i would stay there again;4
the attraction for us of this hotel is the close proximity to universal studios for that purpose it was great good clean room after we were relocated from the room with a leaking shower tap and great locationbutunlike many hotels that now give free wifi in the rooms the hilton charges you unless you want to sit in the foyer the so called best buffet in california comprised thawed crab and oysters which both still had traces of ice it was an ok buffet but in truth lacked flavour i would pass on the buffet and catch the shuttle to the universal city walk and eat there less expensive and better flavours also be careful if you ask the staff for the opening times for universal studios you would think they would know this as they are primarily in this area to;4
checkin was lengthy with an insufficiently staffed front desk the room was clean and spacious though the sheets werent the most comfortable felt a bit aged and overwashed within walking distance of the airport and with the traffic in the airport it can be faster to walk to the hotel booked for the convenient location more than anything despite the close proximity to the north runways and all the airportarea traffic it was fairly quiet;4
we reserved the captains suite it was nice a bed a desk and place to out luggage nothing out of the ordinary an old hotel with a semi kool vibe the place is busy at night and has a great rooftop for drinks the room was clean and good products in the bathroom our linen was clean and quiet at night we chose to have a private bathroom very nice it does not have the new feeling however it was very interesting the carpets in the elevators need some tlc might come back;4
just returned from a lovely stay at this hotel the entrance lobby is wonderfully grand and really takes you back to another era reception staff were very helpful and friendly yes there was a queue but this is a huge hotel and to be expected i think rooms are basic but very clean and serviced daily and again with a 1930s feel we were on the 22nd floor and was quite noisy at night but nothing a set of earplugs cant solve tick tock diner was excellent had two evening meals and one breakfast there and both were super service excellent and always friendly also tried the italian attached to the hotel which is not fast food and although more pricy to be expected the food was lovely much more of a restaurant in every way as for location then this one is perfect for;4
would i stay again yes location great room well if u are used to 5 star then no but comfortable and clean yes water so hot though and bath fills real quick the road noise is loud but amazing at same time 5 to store bag upon check out although 12 pm check out so thatâs a bonus we walked everywhere amazing central location we did 9 11 empire state central park high line brooklyn bridge times square hudson yards all on foot we did do a private transfer 90 dollars with no hassle to hotel text them for a return trip tick tock diner was fab drinks are average 8 a beer and 12 a wine or cocktail we found irish bars have happy hour 5 a a drink lucyâs across from hotel does happy hour 47 macys 67 min walk we walked about 27000 steps a day but we;4
comfortable hotel in good location in midtown kind staff always available good quality of the room queen standard and efficient housekeeping we didnt use others services and we cant give our opinions;4
hotel staff was professional and provided good service chris the concierge was excellent and quite good at following up with details the location is central to being near central park and the upper west side my room was relaxing though it was a bit worn and in need of freshening up but this wasnt an overall negative wifi was ok but not great at times wasnt to much of an issue just odd that in 2015 wifi isnt a top priority but hey its the usa and you cant always count on technology being up to standards overall nice stay at the empire;4
the empire hotel is a good hotel in a good location the public interiors are quite heavy and dark but sexy and the animal print soft furnishings may need a rethink however the bar area is always buzzing mainly because the hotel is opposite the opera the rooms are of a good size with neutral tones but the open wardrobe space with only 3 hangar space is not ideal the fitness area was the biggest let down and needs an update asap as the amount of equipment does not suffice to a hotel of this size if you want to stay uptown you could do a lost worse than staying at the empire however be prepared for long taxi rides downtown with drivers often hesitant to drive all the way back to lincoln sq;4
stayed overnight while in ny for medical appointments while the hotel seems pricey and i know itâs ny the staff was great checking in was smooth and the gentleman was very helpful jeff helped us with our bags checking them twice holding door etc he made a personal connection with us after asking where we were from so he really made our stay pleasant thanks especially to jeff room was spacious comfortable and clean could not get room internet connected but didnât continue to try great location;4
the price of the hotel is good for a manhattan hotel the location is great just a few meters away from the subway station on 96th and 3 blocks away from central park which is wonderful the only problem i had was that i arrived at 1 am in the night and even then i had to wait for about 45 mins to get my room the receptionist was very slow at doing the checkin at least with another guest with me it didnt took so long the rest of the experience was good the room is ok not the best but just ok for the price the hotel is on renovation so i guess it will be even better later overall a good experience since other hotels are very expensive there in manhattan;4
this is not the standard or a hilton but for 199 a night its excellent considering its in hollywood the customer service from front desk to the maids to the fantastic restaurant is top shelf very friendly staff the breakfast is as good as anywhere comfortable beds pillows and cold air rooms on the small side but again for the price i will stay here again jim detroit mi;4
hotel is an excellent location for visiting universal and for hitting the hollywood sites the rooms were very nice large bathrooms the staff was very courteous and attentive they brought a basket of fruit our first night which was nice i only have a couple of complaints the prices in the restaurant and the wait for elevators we did not eat at the hilton as there are more reasonable places to eat at citywalk across the street we did buy coffee in the coffee bar and it was great it took an especially long time to get an elevator there may have been two elevators inoperable not sure but we never saw them working;4
great location for visiting universal studios and hollywood lovely large rooms and very comfortable beds just a few minutes walk to the citywalk restaurants and the theme park highly recommended for couples or a small family helpful staff;4
we reserved a deluxe king and were upgraded to a junior king suite which was a single large room king bed sofa and easy chair safe big closet drawers clean great view over broadway housekeeping was on the ball clean everything worked front desk staff were friendly and helpful;4
hotel hollywood is a reminder of a bygone era and our 3 day visit here in april 2017 was on the whole a positive experience this commenced with being able to access our room well before checkin time which was a blessing following the flight from australia our room was quite spacious but furnishings are a bit dated and the room lacked a little tlc for example nonworking power points beds are quite comfortable however the rollaway bed requested was extremely uncomfortable and very noisy every time you rolled over furthermore the rollaway was only supplied with one blanket which resulted in a 2am visit to reception house phone was broken to request additional blankets our room didnt have a safe but the use of a security box at the 24 hour reception was provided the;4

id always wanted to stay at the empire hotel and i was not disappointed its a beautiful hotel in a great location its easily within walking distance of everything you need we walked to central park 5th avenue broadway times square although some take a bit longer to get to so take that into consideration if you are not of the best health the rooms were lovely but i felt they were a little cramped and a bit less space than i had experienced at other hotels it was a bit pricey but it is new york and you do pay for location an enjoyable stay although at night it was a bit loud but you get that everywhere in new york;4
the rate was great as long as you avoid the upsells i did not win the great room lottery as i have had better rooms in the past three good restaurants in house great location cabs outside doorman subway at corner more trains at penn station virtually across the street;4
after reading many mixed reviews i was a little apprehensive on arrival on arrival we were advised that our two rooms had been upgraded due to my mums 60th birthday the view was brilliant we had an amazing view of the empire state building the room was clean a normal sized room for a nyc hotel room our rooms were cleaned daily and we always had fresh towels there is a restaurant called tik tok in the same building this is great for breakfast or a late night snack my only con with the hotel was that there were no hot drink facilities within the room if you want a kettle there is a 25 a day charge there is a starbucks right opposite the hotel that is cheaper each day the hotel is within easy reach of time square a stones throw from maddison square garden i;4
this hotel is in a great location on the upper west side reasonably priced and with a staff that is friendly and helpful;4
ok the room was rather small but it is nyc but a large bathroom it was very clean and just what we needed for our 2 night stay a wonderful location in midtown what makes this hotel a lovely place to stay are the people working here a big thank you to jeff at the door and tiffany at the desk for making us welcome from minute one and answering questions and offering helpful advice we would absolutely stay here again;4
we got a good deal to this hotel through lastminutetravelcom and was happy to get a room with a private bath for the price of a hostel in nyc the hotel is located on 106th and central park west it is convenient to 110th and 103rd subway stations as well as plenty of buses that run near by we arrived really early in nyc since we caught a red eye plane and we showed up at the hotel around 9am to drop off our bags we were initially told we couldnt check in until 1pm at the earliest my husband had to do some last minute stuff for work so we sat downstairs in their small computer station area the manager saw that we were waiting for a room and was able to give us a room around 1130 am the room was small a bit claustrophobic after the two of us were in the room with;4
i love that the rooms still have a 1930s feel about them we had 2 queen beds and a big thrill was to open what i thought was a closet door only to discover a 2nd full bathroom i felt like we hit the jackpot where do you get a decently sized room with 2 bathrooms in nyc i guess we lucked out as only a few rooms have these i think during renovations they made 2 small ensuite rooms into one id give them 55 if they had a coffee maker in the room there is a starbucks and macdonalds across the street but i like having my morning coffee immediately upon rising while in pajamas id definitely come back;4
i actually measured our bunk bed room 50 wide x 68 long since we are used to camping in our vw bus we had no problem with these cramped quarters when you are in manhattan why spend time in your room the room was tidy but the mattresses were thin hard and terribleand really theres no excuse for that also on hot summer days youll want to keep the electricity on for a few hours to run the ac before going to bed or youll be uncomfortable the ac was one instance in which the historic decor of the place impaired the comfort of the place the wood panel in front of the unit prevented proper airflow so you have to run it twice as hard as an ordinary air conditioner i recommend keeping the metal fob from the keychain in the wall and just remove the;4
spent 3 nights at this property in october 2013 chosen due to its proximity to universal studios very comfortable room and bed quiet pool area and short walk to the park city walk big buffet breakfast available short walk to metro rail which is cheap clean and easy to use good place to stay moderately priced;4
situated between the 57th and broadway this hotel is convenient and cheap by nyc standards rooms are ok the bed was truly comfortable the staff is friendly and efficient all in all a good choice if do not aspire to luxury and function is what you privilege there is also a small gym open 2424;4
pro modern efficient walk to metro station and walk to universal studios con expensive self parkingbeware nice and upscale;4
adequate accommodations and pleasant helpful staff great location for a lincoln center area stay we did not like the first room offered us but were very satisfied with alternate room offered we look forward to return stay;4
we stayed in the smallest bunk rooms so expected a small space and a small space is definitely what we got main issue was the fact that the heating was on full blast so we had to keep the window open didnt appear that we could change this ourselves in such a small room it felt like we were staying in a swedish sauna despite this ive still given the hotel 45 stars and this is because the facilities were excellent the staff were really friendly and helpful and the hotel was in a superb location so easy to walk or travel into central manhattan my favourite thing about the hotel was the atmosphere it had a real grand budapest hotel feel to it and it felt like i was staying somewhere really special and unique if i were ever to return to nyc id stay here;4
where to start the jane is a great little hotel the rooms are tiny its like a train or ship cabin â so be warned but you are in nyc so you shouldnât be spending too much time in them anyway the room is equipped with ac a fan tv ipod dockalarm clock and safe the mattress was a little on the thin side as its just a piece of foam but i managed to sleep well during my stay the shared bathrooms were very clean and there was rarely a wait to use ether a shower or toilet â although it was a little weird to learn that theyâre shared by both male female guests â although you get used to this pretty quickly they also provide shampoo conditioner body wash in the showers the location of the hotel was perfect â very close to the high line chelsea market with some;4
we came here in feb for 4 nights have to say i was impressed with hotel fab location near to everything close to bus station too so jersey gardens was easy to get too room was small but very clean cleaned all days i think would have no prob recommending or staying again;4
we got a terrific deal on priceline and stayed at the empire for three nights around christmas the location is fantastic the hotel is well appointed the rooms are small but comfortable highly recommended especially if you can get a great rate we paid about 130night which i think is pretty good for nyc i would certainly return;4
i want to mention that i worked with pasquale at the front desk and received particularly helpful service i had a complicated booking which involved several changes over the course of a week the front desk staff were excellent kind friendly and caring saw to it that my stay was convenient and pleasant i received a fine room and was able to stay in the same room when i made the changes;4
room was clean but the shower is tatty needs refurbthe lift is slow 5 or 6 lifts but only 1 working for big hotel people not happy as we have to wait for 15 minutes if ur lucky staff are friendly and helpful restaurant adjoining ok reasonable prices;4
we liked this hotel it has a lot of potential good location for those who have a car but still walking distance to the subway it has a pool but we didnt use that to cold weather compared to the other hotels we have tried in the states do they have very good breakfast our greetings to the chief hugo the hotel needs a little bit more attention and affection from their owners to be a top grade hotel but then it would probably have cost much more we had also liked a little bit more involvement from the reception staff;4
i booked the hotel after seeing it on expedia and reading multiple positive reviews we got a double room and were pleased with the amount of space that we had the lobby was really neat as well the downside is that i thought that i got some sort of deal by buying two pool deck breakfasts and that turned out to be a joke it was continental breakfast so nothing exciting the pool deck did have a lovely view i could have spent hours up there the staff that we dealt with were cool and nice so all in all i enjoyed the limited time that we spent there we didnt get to check out the restaurant or bar bc we were travelling w a kid but that will happen on the next trip it was walking distance to the subway which was really convenient for us;4
my daughter and i were temporary residents at hollywood hotel in july and it was wonderful warm hospitality especially from chef hugo and sonia who every morning delighted us with a yummy breakfast the room was fully equipped and very comfortable hollywood hotel is well located minutes away from the train station and is surrounded by different restaurants and shops we had a fantastic time and recommend it strongly;4
we booked this hotel because it is very conveniently located right next to the penn station it was extremely easy to get to the hotel from the airport as well as getting around nyc from the hotel via the famous nyc subways booking easy booking of 1 bedroom suite via wyndham website check in friendly staff and it was a bonus that they offered a complementary red wine for celebrating our mothers 60th birthday who is travelling with us but we never received the wine room old and dated room but relatively clean very comfortable sofa bed amenities were adequate we enjoyed beautiful nyc skyline from the 39th floor free wifi paid parking and paid breakfast so we had breakfasts outside luckily there are lots of good food in close proximity check out;4
couldnt ask for a better location and hotel is rather swanky with a great roof top deck staff as a whole not quiet the best with customer service room although clean had mold and pealing of wall paper;4
i visited in june 2010 and had a very nice relaxing stay checkingin was a breeze the bellhop escorted me to my room even though i only had 1 small rollaway and i love that they upgraded my room for simply being a loyal hilton honors member the requested snacks were delivered to the room shortly after the bellhop left and the staff was courteous and helpful whenever i called to ask questions an array of snacks is available in the standard room and there are plenty of beverages as well wireless internet was 5 but thats better than the 15 other hotels charge internet connection was always good never any delays of interruptions the gift shop downstairs is stocked well with clothes souvenirs snacks drinks toiletries if youd prefer that the bar snacks in;4
stayed one night for work very convenient to penn station the room was small but itâs nyc so to be expected room bathroom were clean so thatâs a huge plus connected diner off the lobby which is also a plus when getting in late from a meeting i would stay here again;4
we checked into the hotel today and have been very pleased so far staff is courteous and friendly we kicked the evening off with a hilton hhonors guest reception which was very nice we have six nights to go do a more thorough review to come jws;4
we had a noisy room last time we stayed and mentioned it this time at check in they upgraded us to a suite without any hassle and wasveryimpressed luis on the reception was exceptional and the position of the hotel is outstanding;4
hotel was clean and modern and more than sufficient for a single night stay before our travel out we had a late check in around 10pm and the club lounge was already closed it states on the hotel website that its open 24 hours they had a sign up that said it would open for breakfast at 6 am since our family had an early flight out we came by around 630am to the lounge to get some quick breakfastwas still closed after sending off my family on their morning flight i came back around 9am at which time the lounge was finally open food was mediocre all around and everything about it just left a bad taste first if you bill yourself as an airport hotel you know time and punctuality is key overall the hotel was fine and i would probably stay again in;4
stayed here in september and loved this hotel great location right next to lincoln center starbucks right out the door to the right great roof top but a little on the young side for me later at night no ice machines you have to call for that anything in the room cost including the coffee you brew for yourself i would recommend this hotel;4
but i should confess that its the only new york hotel ive stayed in im a great fan of tripadvisor however it does tend to rely upon someones subjective view of the hotel this can sometimes be coloured by how much someone enjoys their holiday my fiancee girlfriend before we went to new york and i both enjoyed this hotel the rooms were clean and well equiped the staff were friendly and the hotel was in a fantasic location its near enough to a subway station to allow easy access to the whole of the city but at the same time ideally located to be quiet at night central park is a delight and is worth a day by itself i would be happy to stay at this hotel again and cant believe theres a hotel like this available at a reasonable price great hotel great;4
i spent 7 nights between xmas and new year and i really made the good choice by choosing this hã´tel the room is small but hey we know that well before booking clean bed was comfortable and for 1 person i had enough space to store my suitcase and hang my cothes towel and so bathroom was always clean and never busy which was also a good point water provided everyday and very nice staff the only issue is that some guests are very noisy slamming doors screaming if you are an educated peson its not difficult to close your door quietly but of course its not the hotels fault i had a really good time its a very pleasant hotel situed between the village and meatpacking district short walk from the subway nice bars and restaurants around ill go back there again;4
the jane has two major room types those where you have to share a bathroom with other guests and the larger more expensive rooms where you have it all to yourself i was in the larger private room which after taxes was about 200 a night which is not bad for new york a city that is pretty much insanely overpriced for most everything involving tourism and entertainment the staff at the jane are amazingly friendly which i later found to be a trait of everybody in new york the front desk and bell staff were warm smiling and helpful the rooms were also great spacious and with this amazing walkin shower the feeling is a bit old new york its not bright and glitzy but very subdued i loved the decor very comfortable bed and an inroom safe that was big;4
great spot very close to lax airport 24 hour shuttle service only 20 a night to park your car which we did for 5 days while we were away nice bar food and drinks area a good choice note make sure you get the right room key we were assigned a room key which did not work security were called to let us in our room after 20 minutes only to find someone in the bed a little disturbing;4
the hotel was perfect location in the midst of midtown manhattan easily accessible by all forms of transportation this trip was a surprise proposal for my girlfriend she loved that we were staying there the staff was courteous and helpful my own complaints are that the bathroom needs major updating i know its an older hotel and thats part of the charm but the bathroom looked like it was from a post wwii walk up apartment i wished we could have checked in a bit earlier since our flight arrived at 945 am we couldnt get our room until after 300pm all in all a great trip and very memorable;4
very good hotel just needs tea coffee facilities in the room for first thing in the morning the hotel is in an excellent spot and the door man called jeff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the city;4
we stayed 22 26 dec good location for sight seeing the accommodation was basic but clean the staff were very friendly and attentive the bathroom was showing signs of wear and tear we tried the tick tock diner attached for breakfast which was typical of an american diner a bit like the uk greasy spoon there was a pizza place further up town on the same side that sold slices for a dollar which was excellent value for money there was also a chinese supermarket on the opposite side that sold fresh fruit and buffet style chinese food we ate in joeâs shanghai in chiba town on christmas day best chinese we have ever had had to wait an hour for a seat probably due to it being christmas day;4
good value and well located i have stayed in many different hotels in nyc while traveling activitely to nyc for almost 25 years for sub 300night itâs a good value as many more expensive hotels do not provide any more in terms of room size or location;4
stayed for 4 nights and found the rooms a bit dated but clean my roommate has an insect phobia and our room passed inspection and large comfy beds the shower was a bit weird alternated btwn too hot and freezing but that was a very minor issue staff was amazing and made us feel welcome beatrix not sure on name but she was from spain in particular offered us accurate recommendations on food sights and travel to airport location was good but a bit sketchy feeling walking in evening would recommend metro and uber to attractions as itâs a fair walking distance hour or more to main hollywood attractions breakfast was good with many options including waffle and omelette station would recommend;4
i am currently in the middle of a 10 night stay am really enjoying myself service has been awesome since check in houskeeping gift shop restaurant staff have all been super friendly accommodating special shout out to ali on the front desk who has walked me through a few technology problems with patience a smile thanks again breakfast is complete everything you could want even have fun cereal for the kids in us breakfast chef is top class good size rooms which are nice but not modern great location right across from the metro 35 to 45 mins from lax airport would recommend for families couples groups or solo;4
i stayed at the ameritania with my mother for a girls weekend in nyc it was our first visit to the city the ameritania was recommended by a friend who once lived in nyc and has stayed here before we were very pleased with the room size and relative quietness except when horns honked or garbage trucks came by the doormen were super helpful and friendly especially jeffrey we would stay here again in a heartbeat;4
pros well priced friendly staff right off the park clean room cool area with good and diverse food choices love being in a neighborhood cons some road noise nothing fancy best for one person;4
firstly we won our stay in this hotel as part of a prize package and so i cant comment on value for money the room was nice and clean but was pretty small we had no issues with the shower or noise as ive seen mentioned a few times in these reviews the main issue we had was with the temperature in the room we were on the ninth floor and even though it was well below freezing outside we had to sleep with the window open and we were pretty annoyed to find our expensive chocolates had all melted whilst we were out for the day location was good being less than a mile to times square and very close to central park all in all we had a good time;4
we stayed at the ameritania hotel for 4 days our stay was great with a few complaints the breakfast overpriced 18hst for scrambled eggs sausage and potatoes the shower was another issue we had only one door to the shower so everytime floor got soaked other than that the hotel was great jeff was amazing very helpful and knowledgeable;4
we booked on line because of the reasonable prices and found the room and common areas to be clean and neat this hotel is conveient to the things we wanted to explore we would recommend this hotel to friends;4
we stayed for 5 nights from 3rd march on the 36th floor room was not too big but quite adequate and comfortable large closet and bathroom with bath and very powerful shower shower head was not high enough for my 6 husband we had two windows both with excellent views one looking down to the hudson river and the other looking north towards times square but this window was unfortunately always covered with condensation so couldnt really appreciate this view would have appreciated teacoffee making facilities in the room but an excellent location for exploring manhattan and we very much enjoyed our stay;4
rooms being decorated which helps but poorly done with paint on new soft furnishings small rooms lovely beds though great location near lincoln centre i love the empire but it can do better some staff brilliant its got a unique vibe;4
stayed with friends for one night the location is perfect for lincoln center shopping great restaurants and drinks the lobby is well appointed the beds were comfortable the bathroom is a bit small and some painting touch ups required in the elevator there is not much closet space i would absolutely stay here again for a night or weekend trip with friends starbucks is also right next door for morning coffee;4
checking in was very easy even though we hit what im guessing is the rush hour for check ins we still didnt wait very long to check in maybe 5 mins figuring out where the parking lot was was a little tricky but i attribute that to being tired from the long drive room was very clean and bed extremely comfortable cal king our room had a hot tub in it which was awesome after walking around all day its not deep though so can only really be in it a foot or so house keeping did a very fast job off the room went out to grab breakfast and came back to room done couldnt have been more than 2 hours id stay again and recommend for people like us younger crowd looking to stay at a reasonably priced hotel with amenities and very nice setting and the breakfast is;4
i like many other travellers rely on tripadvisor for acurate reviews prior to booking accommodation and we were very happy with our stay the hollywood hotel for the price we payed check in was very smooth and we had room 111 which was a ground floor opening onto the courtyard though we never used it exceptionaly clean and a comfy bed i must say though that i would not like to have had a ground floor room at the front of the hotel which was right next to the road and having a balcony that you would not be able to sit at or open due to dust and traffic one of the main advantages to this hotel is the cost with an exceptional breakfast and staff and the fact that the metro is literally across the road we were able to travel downtown los angeles hollywood and santa;4
we booked two nights at hilton as it was the last leg of our west coast trip and we were more interested in universal than disneyland we checked in quickly and were a bit disappointed in our room location as it was right by the lobby and the elevators however this didnt result in hardly any extra noise at night our room appeared to cater for the disabled but the shower chair might come in handy after a big night it was a nice size room just overlooking the side of the hotel no view to speak of but i dont worry about that if theres no balcony anyway the bathroom didnt have much shelf space but thats the only downside and for some reason our bar fridge was glued shut we also couldnt make local calls which was annoying and reception couldnt seem to figure out;4
great hotel clean rooms great service next door to madison square garden great for site seeing the empire state building tick tock restaurant great for food next door to hotel and time square all within walking distance;4
our room was clean and comfortable on the 32 floor but no city veiw there was a facility charge of 160 for 4 nights and 132 resort fee although there is free wifi in the lobby area and we had our own data the receptionist said it was a facility fee and it had to be paid by credit card no explanation was given to what it actually covered there was a diner just off the lobby the food is nice and plenty of variety also a tea and coffee station again at a higher charge than starbucks across the road would i stay here again no for the price we paid for this accommodation it was disappointing the lobby was all show but the decor of the rooms were tired and outdated there were 2 bottles of water in the room but these were at a charge if opened the facility charge is a;4

check in and check out went very smooth this hotel is directly across the street from busy penn station and a short walk to the shows on broadway shopping and food options its a very busy area so be prepared for crowds security checked for key cards before allowing anyone near the elevators so that was an added level of safety we appreciated we stayed in an older section of the hotel that wasnt renovated yet and the mattresses definitely needed replacing as they were too soft that was my fault as they were clear about it up front and i tried to save a few bucks next time ill pay the extra 10night and stay in a renovated room so my back doesnt ache when i get up;4
hyatt shuttle drivers are a hoot and very attentive rooms are clean cleaning staff is very accommodating pleasant stay twice restaurant is overpriced for food served and not detailed in their cleanliness bar is very nice bartender was a sheer delight;4
i enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would stay here again the customer service at checkin was great fast and friendly the hotel has a nice upscale style but there is some wear in places not a big deal to me though parking is either 23 for valet or 18 per day for self park factor this in when you consider the overall cost to stay we had a king bed alcove room that was very spacious and comfortable the windows were huge and offered a great view free bottled water and a fruit tray was a nice touch wifi was not free but i dont know how much it cost per day another thing to factor into the overall cost of the room ironing board and iron and free safe were in the closet lots of outlets around the room to recharge all of our electronics the bathroom was spacious;4
have stayed here before great hotel central for all amienities our room this time was not so modern but it was immaculate and kept that way throughout our only critisism was no fridge which we had previously we had a view of the empire state building this time which was great would recommend this hotel and would stay again if we are ever in nyc again;4
this was our last stay of our holiday we had 1 day at universal studios 1 day at warner bros so the location was ideal the concierge was fantastic helping us organise our tickets to both venues and getting us early entry to universal the hotel room was just a typical hilton room and dated however it was clean and the bed comfortable just what we needed when we came back each night exhausted breakfast was just average the free shuttle bus that runs between universal the hilton and the sheridan is great and saves your weary feet at the end of the day as well as walking in the heat the highlight for us was the warner bros tour it really is great value for money you get to see a real working studio get to walk around sets and at the end can sit on the friends couch on;4
we stayed here for 4 nights while visiting universal studios and hollywood we looked at several options in hollywood but they were very expensive the location accross the street from universal studios is great you can also walk over on an evening for a meal at citywalk just a 15 drive into hollywood to see the sites etc having now visited the hollywood area im glad we decided not to stay there the hotel is kept very clean and the rooms are spacious for a family of 4 the pool is large and very quiet when we used it my only complaint is the parking charges which i think should be free given what you are paying to stay at this hotel;4
this hotel has an ideal location to explore nyc the check in went really fast en thanks to minerva we got an upgrade to a superior room the room is nicely decorated and theres enough space to store your things wifi is free in the lobby but unfortunately not in your room the bathroom is a bit too small whoever loved gossip girl will also love this hotel due to the important role it played;4
we recently spent a full week at the empire hotel booking two rooms to accommodate our 3 teenage boys plus my wife and i the best things about the hotel are 1 location within 2 blocks of central park the hotel affords easy access to the metro system as well and is in easy walking distance of columbus circle and lincoln center 2 ambiance i enjoyed the old school feel of the hotel especially the lounge 3 concierge the concierge who helped us was especially generous with his time and helpful advice this made our excursions into the city much easier the soso 1 the rooms are small and one of ours didnt have much of a view 2 the pool on the roof is tinybut heckwe werent there to swim anyway 3 it is an older hotel 4 everything is extra;4
stayed here for the second time first time was 5 years ago still loved it the room was and had a a view the staff is really nice and helpfull next time when i visit ny i will defenitly stay at this hotel;4
we liked the location of the hotel right next to madison square garden and penn station also having plenty of small places to get food in the immediate vicinity makes it very convenient our room was bigger than we expected and even had a little bit of a view some of the furniture if obviously a little older but still good what we did not like was that fact that there was no caulking around the bathtub this just looks ugly and is something that could be fixed in less than 5 minutes not sure why management does not care about this also the three of us only had two sets of towels again if you have a reservation for 3 it should be easy to prepare the room accordingly to make matters worse we called for more towels but none were ever delivered we picked some up;4
we stayed here as a family of 5 we stayed in a suite with 2 double beds and then another room attached with a sofa bedroom number 2030 it was roomy enough for the 5 of us and had the added benefit of 2 bathrooms which was great as the bathrooms are very small we were 2 mins walk from maddison square gardens and penn street metro we could walk to time square and the empire state building we had read lots of good reviews and negative ones the rooms were very clean and so were the bathrooms there is no tea coffee making facility which is a pain so take a travel kettle there is a fridge thoughstaff were very helpful and it is a busy hotel so you might have to wait to be seen we would definitely return to this hotel you are charged 27 dollars a day for;4
a hotel with character room was in good shape neighborhood was a little sketchy from looks but a safe feeling inside car was gated for safety some of the amenities we could not use since they were unavailable after certain times like the sauna excercise room etc people have different lifestyles and this hotel was geared towards people working banking hours overall for an older hotel it was kept up well and an above average breakfast;4
upon arrival jeff greeted us and took care of our luggage he was wonderful for our whole stay with recommendations for a close quick bite and getting us a car for departure the rooms were more spacious than i expected for nyc and very comfortable i only wish there had been more instruction on leaving your key card in the wall to keep the ac running and also that there was a power strip kindof hidden under the bed we figured these things out on our 2nd day there were plenty of elevators so it was never much of a wait but you did have to go to the lobby and ask the front desk for ice overall though very clean nice establishment in a great times square location would highly recommend;4
stayed here for 1 night in november 2012 with boyfreind we had a double room with private bathroom on first floor building has obviously just been redecorated room was very clean warm quiet freindly staff near to hammersmith appollo tube station would definatley stay here again a bargain;4
this is my favourite hotel in nyc great location great rooms great staff close proximity to all the best bars corner bistro and cafes they grey dog in the west village and close to the subway great for a morning run along the hudson;4
i have booked a room with private bathroom for my mum and myself we first had a room on the ground floor close to the hostel entrance which was very noisy we could not sleep all night because of the door which people slammed people shouting we asked the next morning to change room and the staff kindly accepted so we got a room on the first floor very quiet rooms and facilities such as kitchens are very clean very good value for money would definitely recommend;4
myself and my husband stayed here for 4 nights in february hotel room was cleaned everyday comfortable bed only thing we had on our voucher in room coffee but was told by a member of staff they have never offered it so this was disappointing tea and coffee only offered in the morningbut we found a starbucks close by the hotel was about a block away from thames square so was quite close the consiarge jeff was a lovely person and was very helpful on our first day by showing us a map and hi lighting all the things we should try and do thank you jeff ð;4
a little tight on space as all hotel rooms in nyc right next to the lincoln center and a block from central park only issue was the rain head in the shower was a little hard to work with couldnât turn the shower on unless you were standing under it equals a blast of cold water on you before it warms up fix that little thing and you get a top rating;4
newish very clean and convenient great twin room with bathroom and fridge but only one tvmeeting room in the whole 5fl house and being nonstop occupied by insmoking southeast europeans those people also tend to be drunk noisy and on the verge of fight late at night couple of times also kitchens have stoves kettles and microwaves but no utensilspots at all common bathrooms could use a deep cleaning cleaner never locked our door after cleaning more of smilewelcome attitude from reception would be nice couldnt understand why guests had to pay in cash nearly 400 pounds in my case and not by a card despite all i would stay there again;4
hotel has a fabulous location easy walk to universal theme park and citywalk also close to metro we ran out of time but would have been interested in taking that one stop to hollywood pool was nice and not crowded we did not use restaurants or room service so i cant comment on that we did have a service glitch i had booked queen beds and we were given a room with two doubles this was not a big deal and when i went down the next morning to raise this with the desk staff she apologized and said we would get a 20night credit when we got the bill the next day however there was no credit so i had to trudge down again to get this straightened out i did eventually get the credit the room itself was clean enough but the carpet was old and ugly same with the;4
in town for a family wedding we got a great group rate everything was wonderful except the bathroom which needed updating and general maintenance it was difficult to keep the room comfortable as the heat pump doesnt have a thermostat;4
check inout easy no surprises staff friendly and helpful room decor nice we had a weirdly shaped inside corner room which was small with a double bed was fine granddaughter and myself the bathroom was tiny which again was okay but would not do for many the fixtures were the smallest iâve seen the shower was standard inside door bolt wouldnât latch but the door was locked so i didnât stress much location good close to subway and park plenty of starbucks and deliâs good shopping up broadway;4
we stayed here for 3 nights as part of our road trip its a great location for exploring la and hollywood next door to universal studios which in itself is right next to warner brothers as for the hotel itself upon checkin they tried to charge us three times as much for valet parking as was on our booking i had to produce the printout i took with me to prove it the room was clean but nothing special i personally think sometimes you pay for the name with hilton hotels though the price was okay for this level of hotel in la dining is very expensive at the hotel so we ate out including breakfast one great facility was the heated outdoor jacuzzi we sat in this every night until at least midnight very nice indeed valet parking was quick and convenient would stay here;4
we stayed in the 29th floor which has excellent views the hotel is as classy as a ny hotel can get not too modern but very stylish the floors the elevator the reception is just as classy as you can imagine a ny hotel it could be more modern but the style just outwins the modern style despite the rumours the rooms are clean tiny but clean;4
the only negative comment i have is the decor is rather dated and the jewelry sales man in the lobby area is uncomfortable to have to walk past every day as he encourages the patrons to buy from him our room was wonderful it was clean and quiet we had incredible nights rest and the large views of the city are beautiful we stayed here initially for work then stayed two extra nights to play and enjoy universal and the local parks we adored the staff they all genuinely seem happy and like their jobs they worked really well together and were genuine and engaging the exercise room is clean and nice some fans would have been really helpful the restaurant although dated interior has exceptional lunches and dinner breakfast was large however we didnt care for the;4
we stayed for 4 nights and were given a room on the 35th floor with a great view pictured the hotel is really central which is great itâs not far from the main sights the room was clean and beds were really comfy the shower was powerful really happy with the room staff at the information desk were really helpful and polite and there is a security guard before the lifts to the hotel checking room cards so this made us feel safe upon arrival we were almost a little pressured to upgrade our room from what we were told was going to be on the 25th floor when we declined the upgrade at extra cost we were given a room on the higher floor anyway a nice gesture to give us the higher room but we definitely couldâve paid for it without knowing this wouldâve happened on;4
we stay here once a year and have always enjoyed it great location wonderful staff iconic history its a gem i think she may show her age in spots but thats part of the enduring charm of an historic hotel we love the tick tock diner the proximity to subway broadway and macys walking distance to many cool spots;4
i thought the staff was very professional it was a clean setting however the hotel amenties arent accessbile no pool no fitness center not skiyline room access and the parking at the hotel is ridicilous i never had to pay for parking or breakfast at any of the hyatt hotels but this one;4
i stayed 9 nights at the hollywood hole then went back for a few more nights on the same vacation because i really enjoyed this hotel it is a beautiful hotel the beds are amazing and plush very clean rooms good continental breakfast which goes until 10 which is nice very good hotel for the price my only concerns is that parking is 18 dollars a night which is a bit crazy if the hotel considered lowering this price or giving a better deal for staying a week the hotel would perfect another concern is that there are no do not disturb signs and the maids would try to come clean at 9 am im usually still sleeping then but am always out by 11 or 12 the maids would just walk in and see us sleeping which was awkward this could be a way for the hotel to improve get do not;4
wyndham last minute stay i used my app and reserved this room in a matter of seconds it was late and i was tired the service was great i was upgrated to a room with an awesome view of the empire state building i was also offered a late checkout which was greatly appreciated i would have given 5 stars but the walls are very thin and i heard more than i wanted;4
this was our third visit to the new yorker over the years and while the public areas used to look a little shabby the art deco interior has now been restored to a high standard the standard rooms are pretty small but adequate the novelty in our bathroom was that the hot water was scalding and the cold water was pretty warm so that flushing the toilet had the side effect of warming the seat handy in january i had one big surprise when i checked out and i want to make sure others are aware of it when you or your travel agent make a booking make absolutely double sure that you are quoted a total and inclusive price if not you will be hit by a facility fee of 30 per day plus tax at checkout when i could speak i asked what this charge was for and was told it;4
this was obviously once a beautiful four or five star hotel that is now a little older though it is clear that substantial effort has been made to update it the hotel staff is quite friendly and helpful the facility is maintained well and is clean and the upper west side location is unbeatable the water pressure in the shower is great the rooftop pool and lounge are an added bonus and the beds are quite comfortable the room of course is slightly new york small the only downside is that the hotel interior is definitely on the dark side especially the hallways but to some extent the rooms;4
decent hotel with good transport links to catch buses and metro very close to universal studios and city walk shuttle service is also very good however walk takes around 10 mins rooms are spacious and have decent views especially at night could do with free internet and wifi;4
the hotel location is great the reception staff are friendly and helpful with informationexcept a male reception staff on night shift042217he is not approachable and the information i asked gave me wrong answer i mean he does not know about los angeles city places about the catering staff hugochef on breakfast room is very good and making tasteful breakfast also he is very communicative approachable and friendly other staffs at the breakfast room are very professional too;4
convenient enjoyable for a lincoln center visit staff friendly accommodating rooms complete with amenities and quick response for any needs hoping to make this my home when visiting my juilliard student;4
we were a little hesitant to stay after reading reviews but found that the days hotel was perfect for us we have previously stayed in times square and were now 50 blocks away but the subway station was right across the street the room was fine it was clean nothing fancy by any means but we werent expecting that the bellman was wonderful and gave us a ton of tips resubway taxi and restaraunts very nice guy market was right across street so we could by soda or fruit etc walking distance to toms diner seinfeld diner and just 3 blocks from central park west i will absolutely stay here againi wont even look around next time this was way more relaxed and less hurried than midtowntimes square and it was really easy to get there by subway i liked ny;4
we had a great time here the price was good and the hotel is clean and nice very friendly and helpful staff and a good breakfast with omelettes waffles yogurt fresh fruit etc in price location is good even though the neighbourhood is not very nice try to get a room facing the courtyard it is quiet and check out the pool;4
nice hotel but get ready for the extras wifi 75usd per device per day parking is between 20 and 24 usd per day so you may as well use the valet parking at 25usd per day universal citywalk is 10 minutes walk from the lobby;4
what a treat to be able to walk out of the lincoln center cross the street and be at your comfortable room the empire is the only place i would stay for a trip to see the met there are ample restaurants in the area and convenient to the subway if one wishes to travel further afield;4
a night before the flight we read some really bad reviews on this site and were very freightened however we found the room very clean and the sheets and towels were replaced daily it was spacious had a closet a television air conditioning a sink and a small refridgerator in short it had everything we needed the only minus is the shared bathroom although there were two bathrooms near our room and almost no tenants so there was never a line the bathrooms werent superclean but not disgusting either;4
was here for 6 nights due to e3 convention hotel us conveniently located near red line for easy to downtown la room was clean and specified to be opposite street side much quieter only gripe on room was bathroom toilet seat which was completely replaced immediately pool was great to unwind and breakfast was freshly prepared each morning sonia hugo provide exceptional service are a pleasure to deal with many wifi access points airport shuttle available i would return again;4
majid took great care of us making sure we had all that we needed during our stay the room was small but adequate clean and comfortable within a couple of blocks of time square and close to all broadway theaters we would definitely stay there again;4
we had a comfortable 4 night stay at this perfectly located hotel positives excellent central location our room had views of empire state building and madison square garden quick and efficient check in and check out friendly and caring staff large spacious room with 2 very comfortable double beds on floor 35 small bathroom with a powerful shower and lots of very hot water high standard of cleaning great food at tick tock diner and the adjoining italian negatives waiting for lifts was a real pain one night there were so many people waiting a member of staff took groups of guests up in the staff lift towels were clean and regularly replaced but small and not oft nowhere to place toiletries in the small bathroom no kettle but one could be hired;4
the hotel was fine and the shuttle to universal was very convenient front desk staff and luis concierge were very helpful the dining room for the breakfast buffet was not up to hilton standards the price was much too high and the carpet was covered in food crumbs and spilled food;4
stayed here from 9th april to 15th april nice hotel in a good location rooms a bit on the small side but adequate enough as only spent very little time in them the security guys can be a bit intimidating when you want to go back to your room but just show your key card and the reception area gets very busy at times we ate next door in tick tocks a few times which also gets busy at times too all in all a good base for spending a week in new york;4
this hotel was very close to universal studios you pay extra for this but they had a shuttle that was very regular at picking you up and dropping you off approximately every 15 minutes or so which was very nice the rooms were nice the elevator was being repaired so it was slow but they tried to be very accommodating the swimming pool was very nice along with the hot tubs if you plan on eating there be informed it is expensive;4
there for eds chowder house which was a reasonably good experience this is a very busy traffic and people area this building is old as dirt oh sorry it is part of new york history and worth experiencing i can imagine unlike the new hotels that are sandwiched together the views from the rooms are great the lobby is a dark red wine color dacor there is a balcony area that has comfortable velvet sofa seating that is wifi connected there are a lot of available cabs but make sure they understand where you want to go as they dont speak english directly across the street from lincoln center so i can imagine that they get interesting guests within walking distance of city attactions shopping and resturants the staff can have an attitude but not all of them;4
this hotel is across the road from madison square garden and down the road from macys and about 15min walk to times square the train station is right at the hotels door step we had a 1 bedroom room with a sofa bed in the lounge room and king bed in the bedroom a small sink and fridge in the lounge room there was a staff member on the door checking room keys when you returned before you got into the lift area there was a pizza place across the road which was delish if you want a quick easy dinner in the room the italian restaurant onsite was also amazing with filling huge dishes we ate at the tick tock diner most mornings for breakfast until one day when the waiter changed the total on our bill to include the tip that he thought he was entitled to when we didnt put in;4
iâve now been to this hotel twice and i love it yes itâs a little tired in places but itâs clean steeped in history and in a great location the beds are super comfy the showers are hot and powerful and the tick tock diner is a musthuge portions quick service and tasty food also if you head down the escalator from the reception youâre transported back to its heyday with lots of memorabilia about the hotel and itâs history;4
room was large clean bathroom was also large clean couldnt understand why the coffee maker was in the bathroom but it was a quirk that was amusing location is handy for universal studios parking a car at the hilton is costly but driving is necessary in la if you want to get around location was close to public transport but connections in la seemed difficult we stayed drove to disneyland the restaurant we felt was overpriced the food wasnt that great there is a much better diner at the bottom of the hill around the corner that was fantatsic for breakfast the service that we received on the front desk was great even when we had to check out in the middle of the night to get to the airport at 5am we stayed as we got a promotional rate we thinking;4
the room was clean and the beds were comfortable the breakfast was rich with a variety of food the only thing i did not like was that there was no safety box in the room which was an inconvenience the staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful the location of the hotel is strategic because it is very close to the metro station there are lots of restaurants and a rite aid pharmacy in the neighborhood which was convenient to buy any necessary items;4
the empire hotel is a nicely located property just opposite lincoln center and very near central park the service was good and everyone was very polite the rooms were a good size deluxe king room although the bathroom was small and had a shower the bar downstairs has a cocktail menu inspired by gossip girl and the bar on the roof has good views of skyscrapers and also good cocktails very recommendable the style was art deco and very comfortable especially the bed i will definitely recommend it;4
i stayed here with my girlfriend for the vet show walking distance to olympia combined with a short london break the room was fine if spartan with an unexpected ensuite bathroom which was good roomy also a fridge there is often a strong smell of disinfectant i dont think any bugs could survive the cleaning regime we had stayed the previous year so brought our own cooking utensils there is a chronic lack of pots pans etc in the building there are a lot of new microwaves and ovens since last year so cant complain on that score the immediate area is very quiet and peaceful on a small road but only a couple of minutes from the bustle of hammersmith tube transport to central london is easy by tube or bus and if you choose to stay on foot in the area there is;4
location is perfect itâs near subway and train stations restaurants are walking distance from hotel broadway times square too right across my room are the view of madison square empire state building and rockefeller centre;4
hotel was very nice and staff was great as well location was good for universal trip paid a little more that i would have liked to plus the price for parking but for a short stay it worked for us;4
its a hostel so we didnt expect luxury by any means the rooms are super basic but could not fault the cleanliness and nice and warm even when its freezing outside we were pleasantly surprised and were not there much as so much to see and do so was plenty good enough for our needs a few mins walk to the nearest subway with a direct line on about 20 mins to time square so a little out the way but if you want to be closer in you have to spend 4 times the price your choice;4
the hotel is perfect if you want to be near times square broadway and central park the hotel itself is in good shape and the staff are great given the age of the hotel the rooms are understandably smaller than normal but our room had a good layout the views from our room was limited as it was an inside room which made it quiet the only concern that we had was the room was usually last to be cleaned which was usually when we returned just before dinner overall i would recommend this hotel for its location alone but add in the staff and and you have a winner;4
first of all want to flag weâve stayed at many premier inns so take as read we love them we know london very well the location of this place is amazing for being in the centre of everything next to the most iconic sights iâm not sure it can be bettered unless you want to fork out â£300 a night we knew there was refurb work some areas of the hotel were very tired but itâs all being seen to so will be great when done we had a family room great size quiet outlook fantastic and quiet aircon everything clean but past itâs best quite an ingrained but low level bo smell lingering after windows closed a while however what a fantastic night of sleep beds and bedding super comfy we wished weâd more time to sleep in really happy after seeing everything closing;4
we found the hotel reasonably for new york priced room was very small but clean staff were helpful only hiccup was the lack of a strong wifi signal excellent location we would stay here again;4
i stayed there for a week cons the room was a bit small and we did not have a view coffeetea making facilities and a small fridge would be great aircon is a bit noisy pros the room was clean the bed was comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful the location is great it is located 5 mins walk between 2 subways stations 103 and 110 street and just in front of central park harlem is in walking distance this hotel is a great budget place when in new york and i would recommend it;4
we were surprised to find such a nice room for a good price like this i took one star off because of the rude bartender downstairs and the weird parking accommodations otherwisea great stay for anyone;4
i was a bit wary of staying in this area but with the metro station half a block away it proved a good choice for me i wouldnt like to be in this area without that it seemed a bit scary but i left the hotel went into the metro and that was fine however hollywood is like that all over these days i understand inside the hotel is fine and i felt safe they put me in a recently refurbished room which i found very comfortable and clean no evidence of bugs or anything untoward and after reading recent reviews i checked carefully it all seemed very clean to me the standard of help on the desk was varied but usually i got a lot of help and some hints about places to visit etc the internet is free and worked well for me the microwave and fridge in the room were;4
the hotel is very nice and comfortable it is a bit far from most of the city points of interest but if youre looking for a place to stay close to universal studios its the best the cafe could use a little more menu variety and tables to sit but it is ok as it is;4
i enjoy running so having central park across the street was perfect for me the hotel is four or five miles from the city centre but the subway is only a two minute walk and the trains run pretty regularly into the city theres a good little bar called bobs your uncle to get there take a right out of the hotel another right over the first street left at the second and its just on the left the street is called columbus ave the deli across the road on the corner is horrendous they shouldnt be serving food theres a good supermarket if you take a left out of the hotel just up by the subway as for the hotel i am pretty easy to please the room was cleaned every day and the staff were friendly thats all i ever want i suppose the room was a bit dark;4
great location friendly staff that is willing to help and nice pool loved the walk to the park with great views easy access to subway to take train to san diego we had a problem with the cleaning staff but the hotel was courteous and resolved the problem the pool area was lovely the restaurant was very nice;4
the hotel is small the rooms are small its a 3star hotel but the staff couldnt have been more pleasant the location was perfect for my upper west side stay the 247 coffee room is nice to have if your plan includes spending large chunks of your day in the hotel room you might want to try a different hotel but if youre there just to sleep and you want to be in this area its not a bad option;4
i really enjoyed my stay here as the staff made me feel welcome the room was spacious and clean and the room service was quick although i did not enjoy the food i know that this will sound weird but this hotel has the softest sheets ive ever slept on except my own;4
i stayed here a few months ago for ten nights and found it to be an entirely satisfactory hotel we had a ground floor courtyard facing room and experienced no noise disturbance at all during our stay the room was a good size and the bathroom was huge both were clean and we were given lots of fresh towels each day the only problem we had with the room was when the tv stopped working but after calling reception a porter arrived within 5 minutes and had fixed the problem the fitness room was an added extra that we hadnt expected and although basic it was perfectly adequate for a vacation workout the pool area was a real bonus despite being next to the car park it was very peaceful and well laid out and well serviced by hotel staff there was also a small;4
we had a decent enough stay at the hilton just a few guys in los angeles for business we had pretty typical rooms not one of the big corner rooms those look very big on the floor plans but our rooms were just typical although id say the bathroom was exceptionally large nice bathroom id stay here with my family and kids without hesitation we had executive floor access and i was pretty underwhelmed by the breakfast offerings there i am beginning to think having executive floor access is quite overrated of course getting free yoghurt and cereal and muffins and orange juice is not to be scoffed at on vacation is it wed probably have paid 15 for all that if we had eaten downstairs enh eating at hotels is never really a treat is it otherwise;4
we stayed here for two nights at the bargain basement rate of 115 a night the other reviews seem accurate the elevators are slow the paint is chipping the rooms are big the service is outstanding it couldnt be any closer to a metro and its right on broadway to catching a cab is no problem either i couldnt get cell phone service in my room and the tv was fuzzy but the bed was comfy and the pillows were plush;4
i was stuck in new york because of a train scheduling problem going back to washington dc the hotel was close to the terminal and the name wyndham is so iconic it seemed like a save haven the checkin was welcoming they found a room for me with no notice and got me the best rate they could this hotel lived up to the wyndham name and i would stay there again with a reservation next time;4
the location opposite the lincoln center is amazing and so easy to get around nyc from the hotel invoked great gossip girl memories for my daughter and she loved the chuck bass cocktail in the hotel bar where many gossip girl scenes were shot rooms were very small and walls very thin could hear coughing next door all night door did not automatically shut and several times we found it open decoration is tired and is in need of a complete refurbishment disappointed roof bar was not open and only half of the neon sign was lit the staff were really nice and helpful and the doormen were amazing and very welcoming bar hours were odd and same with edâs chowder house hotel charges for inroom self brewed tea coffee inappropriate;4
the ballroom which is open to everyone is amazing feels so original and oldschool you can imagine all the history that has taken place the rooms however are so so soooo small almost claustrophobic probably couldnt fit a big suitcase stayed three nights plenty to experience the place but wouldnt stay in such small rooms for longer;4
just home from a fabulous 4 day weekend in nyc had read lots of reviews leading up to our visit so was cautious we travelled with two teenagers mohamed check us in on arrival who was very helpful and when i queried the upgrade request he then changed our room room one 2055 rooms in the city are historically small this was tiny cold drafts through the windows dusty and the bathroom was had hairs in the bath was dirty i went straight to reception and saw another helpful lady no name sorry this lady was very helpful and apologised profusely not her thought of course she kindly offered a room update and x4 free breakfast voucher for tick tock for the following day which was perfect the bathroom was cleaned immediately 3624 was a larger room with amazing views;4
luis at front desk is awesome our room was musty and without a view but luis switched us easily to a beautiful room ive stayed here a couple of times before very clean they could use more outlets near bedside and better bathroom lighting this is a great locationclose to subway lincoln center great shopping and many restaurantsand one of the best rooftop bars in nyc if you plan on imbibing in your room however bring your own glassware bartender in lobby lacked customer service skills;4
i was blown away with how the remodel of this hotel gave it new life prior it old and run down now it is alive and full of life the rooms were amazing from the shower only to the bed comfort size of room and layout i was very pleasantly surprised this hotel works best if you have a early flight or layover for a flight as it is across the street from lax walking is much fast then the hotel shuttle due to the traffic at lax the day i was there the lines were long 10 to 12 people waiting to check in to check in with only 2 agents to do the check in that was really the only down side to my stay;4
booked in for two nights pre cruise great location close to macys etc etc welcoming staff we had a great room with a view of the empire state and two queen size beds our friends not so lucky a double bed with a view of the wall unable to move them as full tick tock very convenient huge portions good breakfast very busy with walk in customersstaff very helpful we returned to the hotel after disembarking from the ship and were able to leave our luggage with them for a small charge as we had a late flight home;4
we stayed for a 8 nights in room 2138 and had a view towards the empire state building penn station was just across the cross road and madison square gardens main entrance just a couple of blocks away so was macys and many other shops restaurants diners and an amcs movie theather subways a c e 1 2 and 3 have stations next to the hotel and trains run from penn station very simple to reach from the jfk for example via jamaica taxis can be found in front of the hotel with a help of the hotels doorman we had our breakfast where ever so no experience of the hotels breakfast nor did we use the business center or gym even the facility fee was obligatory addition to the accommodation fee hotel has nice lobby we had nice service at the desk when arriving and;4
extremely easy checkin and checkout they even upgraded my room for me when i was checking in and were very accommodating to me as i have a s service dog that travels with me very nice rooms the only thing i can find that i would change would be the bathroom lighting its very dim and low a bit difficult to put on makeup great experience overall;4
booked 3 nights here for the start of our holiday had 2 rooms 821 which over looked the sheraton and freeway and 825 which had a view of city walk and the universal globe at the park entrance we contacted the concierge to organise a pick up for us from lax which was smoothly organised through deamline limo incthey communicated all the way through the booking cost 9000 for 4 passengers and 4 bags and avoided the stress of getting to the rental companies after an 11 hour flight and 1 hour wait at immigration we also didnt need a car for the first 3 days organised car rental through enterprise its cheaper to book online than through the hotel about 100 difference they have a office about a mile away and will collect you from the hotel rooms were clean and large;4
i was pleasantly surprised i expected a motellike property however it is a small fullservice hotel it is a well kept yet a little dated my checkin was positive i was greeted by the desk receptionist pil he was very positive and helpful whats more he went out of his way to help me with a future stay i must spend three days in the area because my partner was having surgery in a hospital a few blocks down the street i asked if there was a lower rate for such circumstances i had already booked online he spent some time on the computer and offered me a room at a very reasonable rate compared to my own booking it certainly relieved some of the anxiety i was already feeling because of the surgery in the next few weeks i appreciate going out of his;4
i love to travel and i needed a quick place to stay while in the area and this hotel ended up being quite nice the room was a bit small but it was only used for sleeping since i was out most of the day the breakfast was a pretty great bonus and also the staff here they seem to be equipped with the proper knowledge to handle all types of guests especially one staff member jermaine this guy was awesome he was wellspoken and had a great sense of humor overall my stay was enjoyable here;4
love this hotelonly issue is the size of the roomswhen checking in jose said we had been upgraded when we arrived in our room i swear it was by far the smallest room i had ever stayed in even smaller than european rooms did i originally book a closet and then was upgraded to this room anyways we just stayed in the room and made the most of it i will say that after the initial shock of the room size it kinda grew on us and enjoyed the rest of the trip with this said i will say that ill be returning to this location now that i know what to expect;4
we stayed at holloywood hotel in late april 2011 and have enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again the next time when we are in la pros room is clean and the size is decent the beds are super comfortable with nice set of pillows and the sheets good selection of buffet breakfast with good cold and hot meals wifi high speed internet the hotel has a sauna and a pool if you want to use friendly staff we left some personal belongings behind after we left la we contacted the hotel and they happily posted the belongings to the hotels of our next destination in san francisco the hotel is half a block away from the la metro and is only 4 stops approx 10 minutes to chinese theatre and walk of the fame etc cons the hotel is not located right on the hollywood;4
stayed here january 2020 mohammed at the desk was very friendly and checked us in early and upgraded our room to one with a view of madison square garden room was pleasant its a few years past its prime but the price and location make up for that never actually had to deal with the front desk but the security personnel that checked our room key for access to elevators were always pleasant they will hold bags for a 5bag charge the location here is greatvery close to penn station and msg the tik tock diner can be accessed through the hotel lobby also had a minor elevator issue our first day door wouldnt fully closeoperate but it was resolved quickly the elevators are divided with the upper floors being serviced by a separate bank of elevators all in all a;4
the standard room we stayed in for two nights with double beds was clean and comfortable for our family of four my only little issue was that the water in the bathroom sink drained slowly the shuttle to citywalk was very convenient also the walk there did not feel long at all there were asian lions dancing in the evening for the lunar new year which my young children really enjoyed;4
my daughter and i were staying four days in this hotel we enjoyed the location and the hotel staff was mostly nice we enjoyed the beds and pillows the were amazing our room was cleaned daily and the staff were very nice when asked for extra towels ect i would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to new york city ðð the only complaint i have is the evelators are horrible you always have to wait on them also we were stick on our floor waiting on a elevator for like 40 minutes or morebeing so far up i cannot go on the stair overall we had a pleasant stay love the doorman they were so sweet and went out of their way to help;4
great location comfy clean roomsparking was more than advertised but i guess that is just nyc for ya shower flooded and backed up some werent able to shower to until the next day when it drained in its own as we were told maintenance wouldnt be on the property until the following morning the rooms were small but good for nycvery loud and can hear everyone in the rooms adjacent to you and outside we did enjoy our stay and would reccomend;4
listen my husband and i booked a room at the hyatt regency in new jersey overlooking manhattan they swindled us after the first night at the hyatt we asked the for the total amount at the end of the week just to doublecheck and bam instead of it being 1300 it swelled to 2500 the lady at the front desk was rude and unpleasant i refused to stay there another night so we went fishing for a new hotel in new york city and came across the days inn mscoral castillo the lady who helped us was sympathetic and kind she gave us an upgrade bed at no additional charge and was professional charming and just delightful everyone at the days inn was pleasant the room was chic and cozy the bed comfy and the bathroom was clean the room was always cleaned once we got back from;4
my stay at the empire hotel was very enjoyable the beds are comfortable the rooms is clean and the location at lincoln center is great they do not offer some amenities that should be free like coffee in the room;4
i stayed here for 17 nights in july 2010 yes a little too alan partridge the brits will get it for my liking the hotel is very good some great service stewart on the front desk was particularly attentive and helpful my room was a king alcove very roomy with a comfortable bed great view see photo and a good bathroom i worked in my room for much of the time so started to get sick of it but all in all it was very good the tv was a quite old 43 crt but worked fine and provided a decent range of channels fine by me my room was on the universal studios side of the building which gets sun in the morning the rooms on the other side got the sun all afternoon and can become a bit warm one of my colleagues found the ac in his room on the other side had;4
the biggest thing this hotel has going for it is the convenience right in the middle of everything and for us coming in to nyc by train a stones throw from penn station thats why weve chosen it twice in the last 10 years checkin was a wait on a saturday afternoon but the front desk staff were very nice the room was very clean but quite small the bathroom even tinier but it worked for one night with two people and it was blessedly quiet on the 8th floor checkout was easy the next morning too the only real complaint we had was that we had left our two bags with the storage dept 2bag storage fee as we had time for a quick museum tour before catching our train at noon when we returned to the hotel at 1130 to pick them up we encountered a huge long;4
after reading reviews on this hotel i wasnt sure what to expect i chose this hotel because it was close to my brothers place and the metro subway station i had a nonsmoking room facing the patio garden with 2 queen sized beds the room was clean and large enough for our needs it had a coffee maker fridge and microwave which was very convenient it had a flat screen tv and free internet staff were friendly and check out was quick and effecient reviews were accurate about the elevatorsthey are slow and you cant use the stairs but i knew this ahead of time so it was not a big deal the breakfast buffet was the same everyday but my 2 children did not mind it consisted of homemade waffles bacon eggs juice toast bagels 3 kinds of cereal i would have liked cream;4
we had an excellent stay really cant complain about anything had read some overly picky reviews about bed firmness but ignore these because people have different bed preferences we got a nice large room i later learned that i booked accessible rooms without realizing was concerned about reviews i read about tiny rooms but its new york and its to be expected so i was pleasantly surprised;4
stayed at the ameritania from the 30th of april to 4th of may great location rooms were clean all staff members were very helpful and friendly the one issue i have with the hotel is that there did not offer coffee to guests there is supposed to be a coffee station at reception but during our 4 night stay no coffee was available just tea bags1 type of tea on the one day with no sugar or milk i mean come one this is the 2018 and no coffee or tea even the cheapest hotels in south africa offers that and its not like the ameritania is cheap although compared to other hotels in the area it was the cheapest option when we booked;4
we stayed for 4 nights just before christmas we wanted something basic and nearby the main attractions of london we were pleasantly surprised with abercorn the location was perfect close enough to downtown to not spend long on the tube but far enough away that we werent spending an arm and a leg on the hostel we were really pleased with the cleanliness and warmth of the room though it was a bit loud on the ground floor the hostel allowed us to check in at 9 am which was awesome as wed just come off a red eye flight the hostel is 2 minutes from the tub station and 3 minutes to a wide variety of shops cafes and pubs i was especially pleased with the amazingly hot powerful shower in our ensuite i will definitely stay with abercorn next time i am in london and i;4
it is what it is room is small but so what most comfy bed i have ever slept in staff friendlyhandy to trains and buses would avoid venturing anywhere other than colombus circle at night as the local eateries not tourist friendly otherwise a great location to see the real new york;4
a great location if you are planning to attend concerts and performances at the lincoln center which is just across the road we spend 9d9n there it looks like a very old establishment service was friendly and the concierge was most helpful our superior king sized bed room was kind of small and tight like most rooms in nyc but it was adequate we had brought our own bedroom slippers there was a bedside table on each side with a reading lamp and a writing desk and two chairs the wardrobe space was very limited only good for hanging tops and shirts but not pants or long gowns there were only two drawers for knick knacks an iron and a table top iron board were provided difficult to use there was also a safe and a mini fridge we could find only two power;4
we loved the location away from the crowded times square area this was convenient to subway central park 5thmadison shopping areas room was small but expected for nyc could have used more lighting as it was hard to put on makeup with the tiny bathroom we did have to ask for towels everyday but that was minor overall a great experience and great value for the price;4
we booked this hotel through virgin holidays who we also booked our trip to new york through we had never been to new york or america before so were unsure what to expect on both accounts when we arrived at the hotel there was a door person to assist with our luggage straight away who took us straight to reception we were greated warmly at reception and given complementary bottles of water the room we stayed in had two double beds and a bathroom with a toilet basin and shower although the decor is slightly dated we could not fault the hotel on cleanliness the room was cleaned every day with towels changed every day and the sheets were changed at least once during our stay the hotel also had a turn down service which was a bonus as for location you cannot fault the;4
the hotels location was the biggest eye catcher it was at walking distance from the shops the metro which is a boon and the central park since it is an apartment hotel please do not expect it like a typical hotel the lobby has a front desk where the employee will assist you with any queries etc other than that its a huge apartment with doors on floors leading to different apartments there is a laundry service at basement with usual coin system i was a little disappointed with the apartment i was alloted as it was smaller than the one i saw in expedia coms visual tour but i was told since all vary in size i was given the best available one other than that the room was clean and cosy the small kitchenette was equipped with all the utensils and cutlery that one;4
i stayed at the ameritania during a weeklong stay in november 2016 the booking process was incredibly simple as i booked online through the hotel website and payed for everything in advance â there were also no nasty surprises at the checkout in terms of costs having never been to new york i put in a request to have a room in one of the higher floors so that i can see some of the city this request was honoured and the view i had was amazing on my first night i there was an issue with the airconditioning unit but having spoken with the very helpful reception staff they did send someone up to fix it immediately overall the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful with all questions that i had in terms of the location and value for money this hotel was outstanding;4
as first time visitors to new york the choice of accommodation is quite daunting as is the best area to stay we plumped for midtown as it was central to all the sites our agent then recommended the new yorker in terms of location its perfect really close to esb broadway times square msg et al the hotel feels well used to the point of being a little tired in places our room 3432 was quite small and the bathroom was quite dirty hair in the plug hole however it was very comfortable and had good views as this is new york we werent in the hotel that much so overall i would recommend the new yorker breakfasts in the adjoining tick tock restaurant are fantastic;4
we enjoyed our stay at this hotel it has a great location room was very clean a spacious only downside were that beds are not doubles so if your sharing you wont get much room we enjoyed visiting tick tock diner next door;4
we are 2 work colleagues that were looking for a cheap end hotel in easy reach of the new york sights and sounds the jane fit the bill perfectly it was a lovely upcoming place that had a great bar doubled as a nightclub on the weekends the rooms were tiny with bunk beds each bunk had its own tv the bathrooms were plentiful and amazingly clean i usually travel with the wife and have a room fit for us both this was a room for 2 fellas to go out and use as an ideal location for somewhere to sleep we loved itgreat price and great location ideal for walking to the 911 site going to the meat packing district area or getting the subway in to times square please guys visit this quaint and very american hotel at a cheap priceideal for friends wanting somewhere;4
booked a universal view room great view of hogwarts room was spacious elevators and restaurant were being upgraded so was slow and noisy construction shuttle could be organized better eg a waiting line on both ends so that its more first come first served some guests were not courteous family enjoyed the pool though weather was breezy by early afternoon;4
i know that in nyc everything is expensive however the size of this room was so small for the price i paid the view out of our window wasnt terrible at all as we could see somethings other than a building there is a parking lot that is a block away which was very nice msg is also a block away the staff was very friendly and the rooms were clean the lobby has free cell phone charging stations just walk in and sit if you need a quick charge metro entrance and stop is a block away i would book here again;4
great hotel with huge rooms there is also a pool but we never used it during our stay neighbourhood isnt great and realistically you need to drive everywhere was about 10 min drive to hollywood blvd park at highland and hollywood great spot to see hollywood sign taxi cost 20 each way so not cheap for such a short journey best thing was the breakfast and breakfast staff who were really friendly and helpful lots of choice and options its a great way to fill up for the day parking is about 20 a day but worth it as secure and gated private car park;4
good hotel and location is amazing security is good at hotel you have best location of newyork nearby so you can walk the talklobby area is good staff is good and so you would have a good overall experience in my view;4
very convenient to lincoln center events a short walk across the street very courteous staff rooms are clean but small typical for a manhattan hotel overall a good value for the price this was our second stay and the stay was consistent from one to the other;4
overall very nice hotel close to airport and sofi however not a big offering for a restaurant staff very helpful and friendly room were clean but water pressure in shower turned way down as with all hotel in western us due to drought;4
it was a nice room the tv was outdated tho lol the other one had a flat screen smart tv and a mini fridge;4
we stayed at the new yorker for 5 nights from 18th november slight mix up by our travel agent was sorted by the brilliant cornelia at reception who also gave us some good tips for ny and was generally very friendly and helpful our room was on 34th floor and whilst nothing spectacular it was perfectly functional given we didnt plan on spending much time in the room bed was really comfortable lots of hangers in the wardrobe and our cleaner also did a great job the view from our room was amazing and i would recommend going for a high room the hotel really is in the perfect location right by penn station perfect for travel by air train and lirr from jfk and for getting around whilst in ny would really advise getting the weekly mta travel card for 30ish which allows;4
only problem was the shower handheld hose leaking badly also the floor in shower area is on the same level as bathroom floor very strange no lip to hold water in the shower bath needs improvement but clean a small fridge available filled with liquor and soda and candies and nuts also offered keurig in room too;4
a short walk to universal studios which makes it very convenient the hotel is okay the rooms could use an updaterefresh but clean overall a nice outdoor pool and hotel tub the service was fairly good when we had issues;4
this was our first time at ameritania the front desk offered me an upgrade of a larger room with 2 beds but it ended up being beds that were each too small to sleep two people so hardly an upgrade i think they needed more queen beds which were our original reservation otherwise i would have given them 5 stars otherwise its a great hotel its right next to the colbert show and just blocks from times square and the subway where you can get anywhere easily central park was just 4 blocks away so we could go running in the mornings;4
good location but quite disappointed at the lack of coffeetea etc i of each free then pay for any more very comfortable beds though were given complimentary wifi a bottle of prosecco for my sisters birthday which was very thoughtful quite small rooms for 2 people;4
very convenient to lax and the shuttle worked well hotel and room quite nice but there is little nearby so fooddrink options are limited to a taking an uber somewhere else or b being absolutely gouged by this hotel or a nearby hotel for fooddrink i think we paid a fair price to stay here but i would stay somewhere further away next time so as to not feel trapped;4
stayed at the empire for one night and enjoyed my visit the hotel receptionist are friendly and accommodating the room was clean updated and the ac worked great i hate going to a hotel were the ac isnt strong the only negative is the bathroom was small but the shower was large and had a rain shower head i would recommend this hotel;4
we stayed at astor on the park at the end of june for 5 nights the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly the room was sufficient we really only needed it to store our luggage and to sleep in so the fact that its a on the tiny side didnt matter and everything was clean what more could you want being an old building the floors creak a lot and the walls are thin but i put it down to part of the new york experience if you want a view of the park but dont want to have to cope with road noise ask for a higher level we were on level 2 and the road noise was very loud and it did affect our ability to sleep;4
stayed here for 6 nights on arrival the staff were very friendly booked in quickly we asked for tea coffee facilities but that never turned up even thought she said we would get it however we spent little time in our room more time exploring new york hotel was warm and clean yes a little tired but as long as itâs clean thatâs most important to us bed was comfy shower was more of a jet of water but once used to it no problem at all easy to get the correct temperature for the water we would happily stay here again if exploring new york;4
we stay at the new yorker every year for the westminster dog show the staff is always wonderful they have many different room types if it is not overly busy they allow you to check out your room before checking in we love the rooms with two bathrooms the bathrooms are not large but having two saves marriages a short walk to penn station madison square garden times square my husband loves the tic tock diner as it is open 24 hours with good food and he can order breakfast any time of day great cheesecake too;4
this was our first visit to nyc the hotel is well located for tourist attractions and transport within walking distance from msg times square macys penn station esb and port authority we flew into newark and didnt bother with a taxi it was cheaper and quicker to get the train to penn station 5 min walk by london standards yes the room is small but clean and functional the staff at reception were friendly and helpful we tried the tik tok diner and the hotel bar breakfast was fine but nothing special and bar overpriced my only issues facility fee who charges for wifi and why plastic shower curtains;4
my daughter and myself spent 6 nights at the jane we found the staff helpful and friendly the rooms were clean we were in a bunk room which was very small but we did know this before we arrived the shared bathrooms were always clean and tidy i never had to wait for a shower and the water was always hot the jane is in a great location and when i come back to new york i will definitely be staying at the jane thank you for a great 6 nights;4
i keep my eye on their rates and try to book everyone of my stays in nyc at this hotel it is so convenient to lincoln center and close to subway trains love the rooftop bar some rooms are too small but still very well taken care of by the housekeeping staff;4
i think its everyones dream to visit the united states me and my girlfriend got the visa and got the chance to visit so many cities in america every step we took every place we saw made us happy and we are also thinking to try and find a job here this hotel was nice and clean friendly staff and nice atmosphere book a room here it s really worth it;4
we stayed 4 nights and it was all very clean the service at the desk us helpful and the rooftopbar is beatiful the hotel is also very central so you can walk to the times square in less than 20 minutes;4
we booked three rooms here for two nights as a family of ten travelling from australiaour main reason for booking here was the nearby location of universal studioslax walk of fame as well as free parking and included breakfast as well as the price check in was pleasant with the helpful guy at reception giving us some tips about the area and the hotelour rooms were on the ground floor and in an easy to access locationparking is at the rear via a security gatebags can either be taken from the car park or directly from receptiontrolleys are available the rooms were all reasonable sizeclean and comfortable and included fridgemicrowavecoffee machine and tv the wifi worked but not particularly wellbathroom was clean with showerbath and plenty of hot water our room;4
just stayed 3 nights at the empire the room was a nice size and the bed was great so was the shower the windows have not been updated and i thought the street noise would bother me but it didnt you might want to take ear plugs if youre a light sleeper and end up with a room facing the street the shower was excellent only downside was the outrageous charges for everything extra no free wifi in the room a bottle of water in the room was 8 had to hide the water so we didnt accidentally open one but that aside the room was super comfortable and the location is great;4
friendly helpful staff clean and comfortable rooms walking distance to universal studios nice pool and beautifully landscaped easy self parking with extra fee downside good location worked well for our family and would stay here again;4
great service and clean easy walk to city walk pool is great and staff very nice elevators are slooooooow and give you great line waiting practice for universal studios concierge was very helpful;4
the hotel is undergoing a welldeserved renovation but the rooms are nice i had a very nice bathroom some rooms have a balconey and look towards the internal patio all the staff is very friendly from checkin to checkout they kept my luggage for the day and especially the breakfast is very good with a real chef hugo serving breakfast omelettescrambled eggsvegetables meat cheese but also fresh pancakes croissants bread cereals and more whats nice is that everything is available for everyone a small fitness room a swimming pool couldnt try it too cold breakfast wifi vault and fridge in the room no fee for anything its 5mn away from the closest subway metro so it was nice for me coming for business meetings being without a car there are;4
the hotel room was small but comfortable the shower was good it is pretty close to the subway i had a room only we came to see new york and its christmas lights mistake nothing like the pictures or films;4
we just completed a one night stay in two connecting queen rooms on the 19th floor we were visiting universal studios the location is a 5 minute walk to universal studios i would recommend asking for a room that faces eastuniversal studios otherwise you are overlooking the 101 freeway and there is some freeway noise we used the pooljacuzzi and had a nice breakfast at the hotel the rooms were spacious and clean;4
the manager is a sweetheart very helpful she found me a great room for my dog and was very attentionate breakfast was really good with a nice chef catering to every need for around 100 dollar a night who can beat that;4
my sister and i have been staying at the new yorker for about 10 years on our annual 3day trip to the city we love the location as we take the train in to penn station which is a short walk we pay a little extra for a metro view room because the rooms are larger sometimes we even have two closets in addition to the two beds the checkin time is 400 so you normally need to check your luggage 2 until you can get into your room we were fortunate on this trip that there was a room ready for us when we arrived at 100 it was a wednesday so maybe there are more rooms ready for occupancy midweek than on a weekend we just wish the bathroom had a shelf someplace for our toiletries there are no coffeepots in the rooms but the tick tock diner in the lobby offers a;4
went to los angeles for 10 days and we stayed at the hollywood hotel and it was amazing staff was really nice and helpful one lady whos name is dena was really really nice and friendly and helpful ð everything was great and location of hotel was close by to everything if your looking to tour hollywood and filming locations ð;4
hotel was really good the rooms were lovely and the beds comfy bathroom was a bit small and cramped but ok staff at front desk and the concierge were excellent and extremely helpful cindy and pasquale are amazing pasquale goes above and beyond to help you and get you what you want a very enjoyable stay;4
we stayed at the empire hotel for 5 nights in a superior double room the hotels location is perfect its only a short walk away from central park 5 mins where you will also find a metro station columbus circle there are lots of cafes restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood there is a starbucks in the same hotel building the hotel service was flawless all staff were friendly at all times the receptionist even gave us a voucher for free wifi access valid during our entire stay after we had complained about the outrageous rates they were going to charge us we very much liked the hotel bar nice and cosy atmosphere the hotel features a small gym with three treadmills and some weights there are no windows in this room and it does get a bit warm and humid whilst;4
room is tiny that was no problem staff we nice worth staying if youre looking for cheap and safe however the carpet in the halls feels like it holds the secrets to all the things the hotel has seen its really gross and im not usually that worried about a bit of grubbiness also it was noisy with someone near my room sounding like they were either mentally unwell or off their head on something when youre staying on your own as a woman and your head is right beside your bedroom door because tiny room both the noise and the sense of safety not being 100 was off putting location was very good i probably wouldnt stay again but thats mostly as i also stayed at a couple of home staybnb places and found them so good id stick to them in future if i had to chose a;4
the es yorker is a very nice hotel where we ha e stayed many times walking distance from penn and easy to go uptown or downtown the rooms are variable as to size and the type you pick doesnât seem to make a difference in what you get i feel the hotel doesnât give you any extras for the price you pay no coffee in room unless you add 25 a day no water unless you pay 500 the facility fee is outrageous but they all do it so watch your pennies here and shop around housekeeping was outstanding and there are restaurants3 attached so you donât ha e to go out great if you have kids if you get a good price and want the location and donât care too much about your room size this hotel is friendly clean and secure;4
we found this to be a good clean hotel with good service wed tried to upgrade our room using a link in a confirmation email however the type of room we requested was not available upon arrival an email informing us of this would have been nice but thats the only complaint about our stay the hotel accommodated us by providing a smaller room until a larger one could be arranged later in the day so no worries;4
for what i was paying i was a little nervous about the hotel when we got there it was a very pleasant surprise the staff was very friendly and even let us check in early at no cost the location is on the northern end of the park but close to two subway stop making it easy to access the city it was clean the only problem was the speed and size of the elevator but thats not really a huge deal next time i am in nyc i will give this hotel my considerations again;4
the wyndham was a pleasant hotel yes itâs dated in some aspects but the whole hotel was spotlessly cleanand all the staff were so pleasant and could not do enough for you anyone wanting the perfect base to stay in nyc should not look any further than the wyndham new yorker;4
being fortunate enough to travel to the city for business about every seven weeks im so glad that ive found the empire hotel in a time when personal relationships with customer and businesses has gone away its just not the case at this hotel upon arrival im alway greeted with a warm smile and welcome back zuli at the front desk always recognizes me and shows her appreciation for my continued loyalty to the hotel and does her best to always ensure that my stay is as wonderful as possible the location is perfection clearly room service menu is always delicious and the staff very friendly and courteous im looking forward to my next visit already dm louden;4
we took a trip to la for a little getaway from the fall chill we experienced lovely weather and a good experience at the hollywood hotel we ultimately chose this place due to the great price the room was pretty basic but was clean and the bed was comfortable we liked the fact that the room had a mini fridge good wifi and a tv that connected to our netflix account the room got a little chilly at night but luckily they had a space heater in the room we were on the 3rd floor and our room overlooked the courtyard it would have been nice if the balcony had chairs or furniture but it didnt which we thought that was kind of strange we went to the pool in the evening but it was way to chilly to get in too bad it wasnt a heated pool and sadly there is no hot;4
i love the area and all of the existing architectural beautiful buildings the hotel itself is very nice and the staff is also all around the whole area is plenty to do from shopping to eating to dancing the night away also very comfortable rooms recommend;4
after quite a bit of research on line i decided to stay at days broadway hotel i was very happy with my choice the room had two double beds and was a large room compared to others i had looked at it seems that new york standards are different than other vacation destinations the rooms are smaller and the cost is higher but hey its new york things are more expensive there the hotel was nice and clean housekeeping came everyday and made the beds and left fresh towels they will not touch your personal items so if you leave anything on the bed it will not get made my son left his laptop on the bed one day and that bed was not made but the other bed was made as usual the location was great not too far from anything but far enough to be away from the noisy areas our;4

this was our second time staying at the empire hotel the location is very good within walking distance to central park times square lincoln center beds are very comfortable my only issue is really with the housekeeping staff who never replaced the coffee or condiments sugarcreamer our entire stay 4 nights the front desk staff doormen luggage storage personnel are very helpful and friendly we would stay there again location is perfect for us;4
nicole at the front desk is everyoneâs mustgoto girl she is kind thoughtful caring and wants guests to have a wonderful experience the room she assigned me is fabulous breakfast canât be beat either the housekeeping staff are thorough and friendly;4
great location in west village near restaurants bodegas bakeries jazz clubs old world charm set on cobbled street seen in architecture design decor through to staff uniforms a few blocks from the 14th st 8th ave subway very reasonable to stay in nyc but is basic and very small cosy rooms think tiny ship cabin for 1 door had deadbolt security locks and chain general soaphair shampooconditioner dispensers in shared bathrooms inhouse bottles of water in rooms can be replenished on request unsure if tap water or filtered good wifi cafe downstairs has great satay dish hotel a block away from whitney close to highlinechelsea taxis go past fairly often great views in upstairs bar party hotel on weekends when the fan in my room burned out at 2am staff;4
terrific stay at the new yorker what a historic hotel we really enjoyed the history display in the basement and just being in such a place the hotel has been renovated nicely and the staff was courteous and helpful we were quite comfortable and will definitely come back thank you;4
you cant beat the price considering the great location of the hotel in the west village prior to arrival i loved reading the history of the hotel that it was a flop house where surviving sailors from the titanic were placed our room was in a quiet part of the hotel after reading a tip from another review that some parts can get noisy we were in a cabin room so really narrow but quirky and stylish with a real great gatsby feel sharing a bathroom was no problem only once saw someone else coming out of it it was kept really clean and stylish air con was more than adequate to keep us lovely and cool during the night we were there during a heatwave but it did take nearly 40mins to reach this temperature staff were friendly and helpful and dressed like old style;4
the ameritania is excellently located on broadway right next to times square and minutes from central park the hotel is very nice and the staff are friendly and helpful the rooms although slightly smaller than other hotels are very clean modern and comfortable the aircon system was a bit noisy and you could also hear the noise of the streets but if you have an issue with noise then you shouldnt be going to new york in the first place all in all the hotel was good value and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay right in the heart of manhattan;4
had another great visit at the empire love the location and the rooftop lounge special thank you and shoutout to mike and gerard at the lobby bar they made the weekend extra fun and my birthday special you only turn 21 once pj clarkes is great and having a starbucks so close is handy we did have to move the fridge in the room as i dropped something and the carpet could use a bit of a cleaning back there but overall we loved our second stay and will stay again thanks again the canadian girls;4
with stay in this hotel because it has breakfast which was very good also parking was free since you need a car to visit most of los angeles tourist place like santa monica market farm and drive around beverly hills also there are two metro station very close which you can use to get to pasadena hollywood and downtown the only thing was that our bathroom was a little wear down and the lamp need some update a little bit of remodeling and it will be a great place;4
superbly located next to maddison square garden and just 5 mins walk from times square the newyorker is a decent enough hotel the initial reception area is very nice and all the staff are friendly the restaurant was fantastic and as mentioned the location is absolutely superb to get to all the tourist areas of new york the room was basic but itâs just a place to sleep the biggest issue is the noise from the road below our windows were not the best and all you could hear were beeping cars and emergency services i guess you are so tired you sleep through it but i wouldnât want to listen to it for more than a few nights i am a light sleeper all in all a decent place for a long weekend stay;4
maybe i expect too much the jane does do some things very well for example the washrooms clean clean clean i am hyperpicky about cleanliness and initially the idea of shared facilities gave me pause after three stays i am totally convinced excellent and their staff too kind and attentive fantastic location the problems ive mentioned them in my other ta reviews and to the jane itself air conditioners that work but that you cant really control and are noisy and thin doors that slam both are remediable but would require some capital investment cmon jane give me a reason to stay with you again;4
my boyfriend and i stayed at the empire after getting a great price through priceline the location is very handy right across from lincoln centercentral park and close to the subway the decor was very cool contemporary earthtones and some shine the problem was our tiny room or perhaps i should say the bathroom the small bedroom was doable because we were only in our room to sleep and get ready in the morning but the bathroom was something else there was practically zero countertop space to fit our toiletries we had to keep them in the room where the bed was and bring items into the bathroom to wash our face and brush our teeth let alone putting on my makeup another problem was there was consistently no hot water the shower was a rainforest typespray;4
although the rooms are small you cant beat the location just one block from penn station and close to many new york attractions my room had a view of the empire state building the staff were helpful and even agreed to give me an unusually late checkout which was helpful given the timing of my train travel the room was clean and comfortable;4
although we usually stay at the blvd hollywood on highland the last time was less than stellar this trip we decided to take a chance on another hotel a bit further from the central hollywood area the hotel is delightful and very secure the room was smaller than we are used to and the lack of a real closet was deterring at first however the balcony overlooking the patio was a plus the hotel itself is very clean throughout with a responsive staff the breakfasts were fantastic and made to order by very friendly cooks the breakfast ample secure parking and proximity to everything make this a place we will definitely stay at again after weighing the parking fees versus breakfast at restaurants made this a win as well we pay parking fees at all the hotels we stay at in;4
hotel was nice as hotels go we had a spacious king room big bathroom comfy bed the pillows were wonderful the shower head on our bathroom shot out needles of water so we had short painful showers im not a hiltonhonors member so i missed out on some perks one of which was free wifi it wasnt a pain but a lesson learned it would have been nice to have the hh system explained and been asked to sign up i probably would have the two concierge we dealt with were both very helpful and knowledgeable the food was goodvery expensive but good id stay again if i signed up for hh;4
checked in late in the night as my flight was canceled at newark staff was great and accommodating i was quite impressed i was put into a room on the first floor room was nicely appointed the hand spray on the shower did not work but that wasnt a big deal i attempted to open the curtains but noticed i had a view of the alleyac unit for the building the noise of the ac unit outside the window was quite loud and a bit annoying location was great staff was excellent specifically romeo at the front desk i would absolutely stay here again just get a room on a higher floor;4
yes its new york so you have to expect rooms on the small side but we had a wonderful experience there the front desk could not have been more helpful we had a room facing north with views of lincoln center and the lights up broadway the room was tastefully decorated the lobby is hopping kinda sad we missed the roof deck only opened on friday and saturday nights so far all in all a great stay starbucks is on the corner if you dont want to pay for the keurig coffee;4
i have to admit after reading all the up and down reviews about this place i was terrified i was expecting a rundown fleabitten roachinvested hell hole but for about 80night on the upper west side i couldnt afford anything else on the island i was by all accounts terrified but really it was nothing like that is it a four star marriott with all the luxuries and highstyle life no but is it awful no it was okay simple as that it was adequate and for the location and value it was fantastic especially since it is new york and we were only in the room for a few hours every night anyway we had no problems with the staff they let us drop our bags off before checkin then let us check in early a few hours later and were completely helpful and friendly;4
location was excellent staff very friendly and helpful however room was noisy with all the traffic starting at 5am cleaning of room each day was not of a standard i would have expected no dusting done hovered once in a week and on one occasion had to request the room be serviced as it had not been done by 4pm so had to wait in lobby until it was completed;4
this was my first experience staying within a hotel located in the manhattan area its kind of weird being that i live in new york city the experience was phenomenal the hotel is a beautiful establishment however the drinks are pricey you must be prepared to spend a great deal if you plan to drink and be merry otherwise i have no problems to report thank you empire staff;4
we stopped at the hollywood hotel for five nights as part of a tour of los angeles san francisco and las vegas the hotel was really nice and the king suite was huge with a spa bath bar area and living room area with sofas tables chairs etc we also had two tvs and 3 phones we had the downstairs king suite which seemed dark all the time but there were plenty of lampslights to compensate the reception staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really good as was the housekeeping our room was spotless i would have given the hotel 45 stars if i could the only reason i wouldnt was that the bar was not open at all on the monday and tuesday we were there and there is not a lot immediately around the hotel one other point not the hotels fault is that it;4
as a former resident of this neighborhood i was thrilled to discover that the empire hotel was pet friendly and i could take my dog to her old haunts in central park the price was reasonable for a junior suite which was quite comfortable;4
we had a really great stay at the empire hotel when you walk in the lobby is as others have mentioned gorgeous we had to wait in line to check in for quite a while but i travel a bit so iâm used to that i was told we were eligible for an upgrade in room which was great not sure why we got that they put us in a deluxe room on the eighth floor with a view of lincoln center it was spacious and nicely decorated we had enough room for my boyfriend to sit over in the little seating area and read while i went to bed without too much light keeping me awake the bed was comfortable the room was nice and quiet the real thing you want to know about this hotel is how great the location is if you are planning on attending anything at lincoln center you could throw a;4
the new yorker is a beautiful hotel right in the heart of it all it is close to penn station madison square garden and broadway i have stayed here multiple times and enjoy the beautiful lobby and and the proximity to all that new york has to offer the rooms are a little small but you will be right near all kinds of things to do;4
concierge and check in were fast and efficient room was well proportioned properly cleaned and tidy they are not stingy with towels and toiletries were relatively complete which was a plus service was outstandingâsomeone was helping out with the luggage on check in and at check out assistance was also fast and efficient staff always greets you with a smile and kudos to the managers can be seen helping out their team the only thing is there are no drinks available at the bar and bottled water which is usually complimentary was added to my bill after check out had i known it wasnât free i couldâve just bought at 711 coz they charge 8 for this so better double check before you consume anything at this hotel;4
great hotel and location very close to central park air conditioning needs upgrade very noisy and room needs some tlc staff very friendly however its was a fantastic holiday we would stay again;4
i stayed here 2 nights in december from the moment i walked in i felt welcome the staff was very friendly check in quick my room was small but very clean quality sheets and pillows coffee maker in the room iron ironing board great hair dryer plenty of hot water and water pressure the bathroom was super clean the decor is nothing special but my room did have 3 windows i had the same experience as others slow elevator and no tv but really this was not a problem i was exhausted from my long days touring so i was glad not to be tempted to stay up late watching tv as others have said great location near subway and bus plenty of restaurants small grocery stores a drug store coffee shops etc etc plus the neighborhood was quiet and not crowded;4
this was our first visit to new york and we stayed at the wyndham new yorker hotel on 8th avenue upper manhattan very pleased with the hotel and itâs location is ideal for easy walking distance to many attractions and good restaurants mohammed on reception made us very welcome and upgraded us free of charge to a room on 37 floor which provided us with excellent views of the city and hudson river great food from tick tock restaurant next door especially the breakfasts all in all a great hotel ideally located and would certainly use again;4
i was hesitant to book after previous negative reviews however glad i did the room had a great view o licoln center the staff was great and the breakfast delicious the heat was on the fritz but it didnât get cold at all bc we were in a higher floor check it out for yourself and make up your own mind;4
excellentthe remodeling and fresh look throughout the hotel is impressive i have witnessed the changes ad love the especially the roof top bar wow what an amazing change now we ed a decent rest at the empire;4
new york is a big city there are plenty of five star hotels to go around the empire isnt one of them but its really a great place to stay if you want to be in the lap of lincoln center its right across the street and conveniently close to central park and all the museums around it this is a good choice the room and bathroom was adequately sized the shower was hard to turn off but everything was clean the staff was helpful and the location was fabulous we liked the chowder house too its nice to have it so close the neighborhood includes a few food vendors where you can get fresh fruit hard boiled eggs and pastries to save a little money and time theres a starbucks on the corner as well id say visiting new york for me is like being on a;4
great location on the south bank close to the london eye and easy access to central londonplenty of places to eat nearbyroom was clean and comfortable with everything you need breakfast was good value;4
i have stayed 3 nights in this small hotel in march 2015 it was very clean and the look was very modern the staff at the front desk was extremely kind and were always willing to help even putting our wine bottles in their fridge during the day the room was small but cozy the best about this hotel is the location 510 minutes from time square and madison square garden you can basically walk to everything in manhattan from there i would stay there again anytime definitely a great price for what we had plus side there is a little liquor store in the building downside it is manhattan afterall there is noise coming from the streets and you are right on 30th avenue;4
really nice large hotel the rooms are large and include a couch washrooms are large and lots of windows in the room its right across the street from universal studios it takes about 10 mins to walk there safe walk across the street from universal city walk too which has lots of restaurants and shops parking is 24 a day for self park would stay here again very convenient to just walk to universal studios than fight la traffic on the way back my gps was giving me an odd route to lax the concierge sat down with me showed me a better route and printed a map for me;4
upon checking in there were quite a few people in front of us so it did take some time when we got to the desk we were greeted by mohammed who realised that my wife i were on our honeymoon and moved us to a very nice room room 839 at no extra charge and with a great view of the empire state building especially at night time thank you mohammed staff at both reception the information desk were both helpful and informative we attended woodbury common shopping outlet on our last day and we were able to buy tickets for the bus from reception which was very helpful the rooms are functional and beds were comfortable but the only downside and it may be stating the obvious but as this hotel is such a central hotel which is handy to nearly all of the main areas in;4
i really enjoyed staying here the charm of this place made me think of the roaring twenties friendly staff great bartender and the location is perfect im an opera buff 4 performances in a row at the met splendid rosenkavalier and 2 minutes walk from the hotel lincoln centre juilliard school central park â all close by;4
stayed with my friendbig roomtwo big bedsvery clean and quietgood view from windowfriendly stuffuniversal studious 10 minutes by walksowe enjoyedcan advice to stayabsolutelyonly was flaw for me parking is not free;4
we were able to obtain a refurbished room on the seventh floor and the decor was very nice but so small we could only get one suitcase on a stand with the other on the floor completely blocking the access to the desk and coffee machine no instructions to operate the coffee machine so i filled it up pressed the start button and water started seeping over the desk so gave it a miss just a card with simple instructions would suffice the hotel needs to address this all the reception desk staff were very helpful whenever there was a query they did offer to send someone up to sort out our coffee machine but we were tired after a long journey and we declined the concierge was also helpful with any question i had as was the transport guy at the desk who looked remarkably like;4
great location in london close to south bank and many good shops clean spacious comfortable rooms helpful staff only problem is the stairs to front door is difficult with cases we had an air con unit which was good;4
i stayed here with a group of kids attending an event at the forum and this was a great location for us rooms were very clean and comfortable hotel was nicely decorated they provided a free shuttle tofrom the airport and it was easy to get an uber outside to go to other places my only âcomplaintâ is that there arenât a lot of restaurants within walking distance the hotel has a place called âunity laâ where you can get some food and the sheraton down the street has a restaurant thereâs also a starbucks coffee bean and subway within walking distance we took an uber to hermosa beach one night which is pretty close and had lots of restaurants overall we had a great stay and i would definitely come back;4
this is a historical hotel at penn station renovated some years ago it is a bit worn but still very nice great staff we got a suite with cashpoints for 200 per night with a great view breakfast is not included;4
i have stayed here many times on business really good central location nice rooms quiet property however beware of the advanced purchase business travelers if you have to leave early because your business plans change do not expect the front desk team to waive your charges for the early departure you can leave early but they get to keep your full payment and rebook the room if i had time i would have found a homeless person and given them the key so they would have a nice room for one night granted i received about a 15 discount per night by booking the advanced purchase rate but as a life long honors member and a frequent business traveler to this and other hilton properties i think they could have waived the one night room charge for early check out;4
nice location good staff some rooms with a view problem but okay if you look for silence nights without sirens on the street the rooftop terrace bar and pool area very good vibe there happy to visit there again;4
we stayed over christmas for our honeymoon we travelled from the uk and i was very nervous about staying due to the previous reviews from other customers however i was pleasantly surprised the door staff are fabulous and very friendly especially on our final day when we were trying to get to the airport via a shuttle bus it never arrived due to snow and the door men went out of their way to organise a town car for us our room was upgraded due to it being our honeymoon with a bottle of champagne which was unexpected the snow over christmas was was the most nyc has seen in a long time so we were confined to our room for an evening and it was fine as the room size was great the bathroom toiletries were beautiful yes the shower does leak a little bit but if you put a;4
invest in a second waffle maker lines were pretty long and iâd have to sacrifice sleep to get one when we returned to our room things didnât go missing and everything was clean i shared a room with 3 other people and we ran out of body wash within the first 25 days;4
we stayed at this property to participate in the nyc marathon the staff was very helpful in all aspects special shoutout to jeff the doorman as he helped us find the best way to get around town and provided great recommendations for eating out fancy and quick bites;4
the rooms are tiny but very clean and quiet with thick walls maid service excellent all basic amenities provided the tick tock restaurant was typically marginal ny junk fare but large man at entrance and who served us breakfast was obnoxious really rude to guests particularly a mexican couple he pointed at them individually and said you as the man was trying to explain something goodheartedly and made them recite what they wanted and walked away really really rude not pleasant to us either although he couldnt have done that and he rolled his eyes to us at a man who sat at the wrong table and made some remark he needs therapy and makes everyone feel upset or uncomfortable the downstairs restrooms in the morning were filthy on sunday morning;4
visited ny and stayed in the new yorker great location and in walking distance for lots of the attractions rooms slightly small but when you consider when the place was built itâs fine and thereâs so much to do that we werenât in the hotel that much msg empire state central park macyâs times square and others all near to the hotel bus stop for big bus tours nearby which is a great way to see more from a different perspective and with a quality audio commentary would definitely recommend this;4
our stay in abercorn was very enjoyable and the hostel is brilliantly laid out the seperate shower and toilet rooms as well as kitchens a shop and tv rooms were extremely convenient as you were never left queuing or needing anything the staff were very warm and welcoming and our room was lovely;4
the hotel is located opposite penn station and only a block away from macys the empire state building it is a lovely art deco building which has been well renovated there are two restaurants on the ground floor bianca an italian restaurant and a great deli called tick tock this restaurant is open all hours has an extensive menu and the food and service are both very good we had stayed at the hotel before and this time our room was very small the queen bed was almost against the wall and it was a squeeze to get around it at the bottom the bathroom was adequate with a good power shower service was excellent with all staff being friendly helpful;4
ive stayed here three times now and its absolutely fine its not particularly smart its kind of run down but its cheap clean and secure the staff are pleasant and happy to help and on the occasions ive stayed there the rooms have free wifi i have noticed that some rooms have been redecorated so you might want to ask for one of those although such rooms were really small ive stated in one of the double rooms which are big but old fashioned again ive never had problems with cleanliness the location does at first seem like its a long way from where the action in nyc is but its right next to the one line on 96th street which is an express train stop and will get you downtown in 10 minutes its also very close to amsterdam avenue walking;4
i only stayed here for a couple of nights but i liked the place a mix of people staying long and short term there were a lot of people to talk to good social area with large tv internet not free but very cheap so didnt mind paying for it just around the corner from hammersmith tube station and really easy to get into central london for all your sightseeing needs quite close to some really cool bars so if youre staying on a weekend this would be a great option as all in walking distance staff kept themselves to themselves but had all the info i needed when i needed it;4
amazing hotel and location would recommend this hotel but the only issue we had and i am still trying to resolve iswe checked out our room yesterday and paid cash for the service charge for 3 nights which they gave me a receipt for when we arrived my bank card details were taken as a hold i was told they said no money would be taken from my card it was just a hold in case of damage and non payment of service charge i paid cash for service charge when we checked out and double checked that no cash was to be taken form my account which they replied no but there is still a pending transaction on my account from them no money should be taken from my account as all monies have been paid i now have no access to this money until they release the pending against;4
as a huge fan of art deco this was heaven for me when it comes to decor the staff was great the room was always clean samira at front desk was lovely and helpful give that sunshine a raise down side its a very big hotel so you wait a while for an elevator and dont expect much of amenities other then that great;4
we stayed twice during may on our first visit a warm welcome greeted us on our arrival after our flight from the uk however our room was not what we expected and so after a quick word we were looked after by majid who ensured that everything was well organised for us during our time there majid assured us that on our return the second visit would be a bit special it certainly was special with a very large comfortable corner room at the top of the building with wonderful new york views an excellent end to an excellent holiday we have stayed in this hotel three times now and we plan stay here whenever we return to new york the staff are all wonderful and eager to ensure you have a great stay thank you we will be back;4
spent a couple nights in town to see a show used rewards points so the stay was basically free happy with the location facilities and service an added bonus was looking out the window straight down 34th st at the empire state building would stay again;4
i spent a couple of nights in november 2012 for a business trip at empire hotel i has stayed there before and was happy check in was easy and staffconcierge were very helpful the concierge had spent a few hours locating speedo swimwear for another guest earlier that day and was excited to have found it i asked for a higher floor room and did get it my room was small on par with nyc rooms but had a great view bathroom was also small but loved the rain shower and the aminities there was a faint constant banging noise around the hallway on my floor but couldnt hear it in the room one issue on the 2nd day my bathroom wasnt clean properly i didnt have enough towels and the toilet wasnt clean i used the bar where i could get a drink and work on my;4
this hotel in nothing fancy but the critical reviews dont match my experience the room a nd corridors were clean beds comfortable bath small but clean and everything worked the neighborhood is a standard ethnic neighborhood in la price very low for that part of la excellent metro access parking charge normal for the city one caveat breakfast is not available and no nearby options so far zsi could tell;4
first is location hard to be better at the intersection of 34 th st and 8 th avenue across from pennsylvania station i used to visit this hotel with my parents 50 years ago it dates back to 1929 it has had a checkered career but now is under the wyndham banner and things are looking good this is an art deco masterpiece the museum and photo display in the downstairs lobby was a lot of fun the rooms were comfortable though on the small side the staff was extraordinary nice at the time they had an extra facility fee which seemed to be added to all the bills to cover wifi and exercise and business equipment a bit odd but we got a deal on price we had a very nice two days at the new new yorker never had to wait for an elevator they have lots old style;4
our family 2a 2c 10 15 stayed at hilton universal city in mid nov for 2 nights our only reason for this stay was to visit universal studios location is the key factor here and you couldnt get any closer to universal however im not sure if it would be a good base for anything else as it seems a little isolated check in staff were pleasant but nothing outstanding room was spacious a double double we had a high floor and universal view which were both upgrades beds were comfortable and there was lots of room for the suitcases bathroom was fairly standard fare but i did like the inclusion of mouthwash parking was expensive as is the wifi the coffee shop was good starbucks coffee and krispy kreme doughnuts you cant go wrong we didnt use any other food and;4
great room clean and spacious great view great service staff is very nice walking distance to universal studios loved it i would definitely recommend to others pool is very nice they texted me to make sure everything was ok which i thought was very cool;4
this is the 4th time we have stayed here this hotel continues to be great value for money probably the best feature is the location on top of penn station opposite msg and walking distance to the esb and times square parts of the hotel are looking a little tired but nothing major room was on the small side but who cares check in was good we arrived about 800am and were provided a room by 930am would definitely recommend;4
think of new york think of the empire state building and rightly so although not as tall as expected and the views not as spectacular as the totr the esb us still a must when it comes to nyc unfortunately you cant do the button pressing scene from elf as you go up in different elevators but the build up and views are worth a journey;4
i came to town for new york comic con and chose the new yorker because its a short walk from the javits center its also right across the street from msg and there is access to just about any subway line you could need the hotel has all the standard amenities and as a bonus theres a nikola tesla exhibit in the basement if youre diligent you can also find the room where tesla died marked by a plaque that was neat that said i booked a suite for extra square footage and im glad i did because the room was positively tiny there was barely enough room in the bathroom to get past the door that opened inward and then shut the door as the door bumped up against the toilet the sink barely had enough vanity space for toothpaste the bedroom area of the suite had about one;4
stayed here for 4 nights with my wife6th trip to nyc and would def use this hotel againrooms were small but really cleanhotel was in a great location with a subway just outside the door 2 food marts a starbucks a mcdonalds and a few others just across the road really affordable hotel just as good as a 4 star double the price;4
we visit the hollywoodsilver lakelos feliz area at least five times a year for appointments at childrens hospital weve tried the orchid suites hotel good value but too far away from the hospital travelodge on vermont too many bug bites too much secondhand smoke and too crowded and hollywood hotel if you can find a good rate and get a room facing the parking lot it is very good value breakfast was fine and filling granted we only stayed two days the pool area was pleasant and our room was quiet clean and very roomy we will definitely be staying again childrens hospital is walking distance saving on parking and the 12 checkout time is generous the neighborhood itself doesnt get safermore interesting until youve gone maybe 5 blocks up vermont;4
stayed here twice so far we like the location and convenience of drug store grocery store and places to eat close to subway as well we have always had one of the older rooms which was ok clean and comfy havent been in one of the renovated rooms so cant comment about that only downfall is the elevators are so small but thats what you get in a building that is many years old i would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay there again;4
absolutely loved this hotel was close to public transport and local cvs breakfast was great with plenty to choose from room was nice and quiet not too far from attractions but you do need to take public transport or uber which isnt too expensive went from hotel to disneyland and was around 1020usd front desk were lovely and upgraded us to a larger room since we were staying there for a week;4
good hotel with central location on broadway close to subway and tourist attraction the room was large and clean the street naoise carries despite being on the top floor but this is new york after all;4
this hotel is convenient to everything as itâs in the heart of the theater district with easy access to central park and 5th ave and of course lots of restaurants and shops abound the staff is great but the fitness room is closed and breakfast is no longer served due to covid the cleanliness is good throughout the hotel and in our room the furnishings are very nice throughout the hotel including the lobby you can tell that theyâve been done relatively recently i would say though that the fit and finish is slightly off for example one of the elevators has a very bumpy floor when you look at the tile in the bathroom the caulking is average and somewhat sloppy we had an interior room facing the inside courtyard so the outside noise was zero you could hear folks;4
when we first arrived at the new yorker i have to admit we were very unsure the lady who first greeted us at the front desk was more interested in the other staff members around her than ourselves and we felt very unwelcome after a long 7 hour flight when we arrived at our room it was absolutely tiny and could only just fit a double bed and a desk it was also absolutely freezing and very near the elevators and i knew i couldnât sleep there for a whole week after phoning down to the front desk a lovely lady called krystal said she would change the rooms over and we were told to stay in the current room for the night leave our luggage there the next day and when we returned from a day out the luggage would be moved to another room for us when we woke up we also found a;4
worth the price clean hotel and nice service breakfast beside that a chef cooking you omelettes scrambled etc are a bit boring when you stay longer time we stayed 10 nights more changes during the week would be an easy way to reach topranking hotel parking are much expensive if you stay for several days usd 26day free parking on the side streets 8am8am then 1usdh read the signs;4
great location close to times square corner with broadway overall a nice hotel it is newly renovated and has a modern design but the rooms very noisy because of the air co even when switched off;4
i dont drive so this was the perfect place for me to stay when going to universal studios for a visit you can use public transport and get really close to it using the underground metro system in la i stayed for 3 nights and was really impressed with the standards at this hilton although there is no longer an executive floor they do still have a great bar near to the lobby i had an executive room which was very spacious and overlooked the interstate and the san fernando valley area the sound insulation was good at this hotel and i didnt mind the view too much as i was not in the room very often the hotel has a pool which i didnt use but it did look very good the staff were very helpful and were able to provide information on what activities there were in;4
the grand old lady of manhattan the hotel is well run with professional obliging staff the rooms are well appointed and comfortable this property is the perfect location for those on business in the mid or downtown areas close to the magor subway lines and penn station for amtrak the downside is the noise it is nonstop traffic with police ambulance and fire services sirens blaring every 30 minutes or more i suggest numerous cocktails before attempting to sleep still it is the centre of nyc so it is what it is;4
stayed at the hollywood hotel for 4 night and it was great staff are so friendly and accomodating the hotel is situated between 2 subway lines 175 for a single trip ask for a tap card that you can load with money to make traveling easier although its not right in the center it is easy to move around bus stop on the corner street will get you to santa monica in an hour depending on traffic breakfast was nice and simple great omlets rooms were tidy and housekeeping did a great job servicing my room daily the hollywood hotel is reasonably priced has a relaxed and nice ambiance but its the staff that make your stay thank you gracias;4
i stayed here last week â this is a very nice hotel clean spacious rooms lovely large bathroom with excellent shower i was greeted pleasantly felt safe welcome because universal studios park is closed covid the hotel had a very deserted feeling the gift shop is only open on weekends there was a doorman on duty but nobody offered assistance with bags etc iâm sure their staffing is less due to covid also i wish there were more food options in the eveningâ the one restaurant is highend full meals it would have been nice to be able to get large salad or lighter options breakfast was delicious with really great waitstaff overall a nice stay iâd like to return when everything is open 100;4
we had a great time staying at this hotel what a lovely location arrived somewhat apprehensive after reading some poor reviews here and on google however we were pleasantly surprised it was clean comfortable and the staff were lovely yes the room was small but the bathroom clean and modern there are some great eating locations on columbus and amsterdam avenues just 510 minutes from the hotel and central park is just across the road the subway is 2 mins walk and takes you downtown in 10 minutes if you need somewhere affordable to stay i would definitely recommend it;4
spent 3 nights at this establishment while in nyc to attend operas at the met older hotel under renovation both inside and outside our room had recently been renovated it was spacious and clean and pleasant we were on the 4th floor but it was very quiet our room faced w 94th the air conditionning was a litthe noisy however and we had to close it one night fortunately the weather was still on the cool side the tv was not working the network was down for the duration of our stay but it did not bother us unduelythe bathroom was a little on the small side not much space to put our toileteries at the sink and there could have been more lighting there is only 4 small elevators one was under maintenance but we didnt have to wait too muchwe found the staff;4
probably 35 stars four of us stayed here for 2 nights in a doubledouble room there was enough room for all of us and the price was right the room was quiet and the window coverings did not let in any light our friends who live in the area told us the building used to be an sro but you would never guess it from the renovation the friends were impressed it has been tastefully renovated we do worry about what happened to the residents though the lobby although dark had very comfortable seating there were some strange things about the room though the square sink was so shallow that it was difficult to use in a few seconds of running the water the entire sink would be filled the shower had no door or curtain just a small wall that only covered about 2 feet;4
room was smart and clean with a great view of the theme park check in and restaurant staff were friendly food was good and location is handy although still a little walk to the theme park would recommend anyone visited the park to stay here;4
amazing location nice design and great vibe loved the room and the friendly bell staff security housekeeping and concierge but the front desk staff is a little too cool they are efficient but not that friendly;4
a relaxed getaway with teenage kids no washing up with a feast at an amazing price to cover everyones expectations this hotel had great comfortable rooms room service staff facilities but do book a head as the location is opposite universal studios so the rooms go fast in the peak seasons i would say its reasonable priced but still on dearer end of a family holiday as food in the hotel is quite pricey so i would eat well at the buffet down stairs or go over to universal city strip and eat at bubba gumps or some place like that over all a wonderful stay for our family thank you staff at hilton;4
the janewhere to start this hotel was sooo good in sooo many ways first off the location is awesome far enough away from the craziness of midtown but walking distance to most of nyc attractions if not walking distance there are bikes avalible or subways 5 min walk from hotel secondly the staff was amazing and kinda hilarious from the moment we arrived they went out of there way to help us with anything we needed bags resturant recomendations directions car service ect all while smiling joking around andor singing between the location and staff i would definately stay here again i was traveling with my boyfriend and when i told him we were staying in a hotel with bunk beds and shared coed bathrooms he definately thought i was crazy and;4
nice staff nice rooms and close to all the things a toursit often visits when in la public transportation is recommended easy fast an afforable to and from hollywood walk of fame by car to and from universial studios is not more then a 20 30 minutes drive and on the return to the hotel after a day at universial studios a 20 30 minutes drive is really appreciated by everyone;4
it is a little dated but it is a well oiled and run machine free shuttles are provided to universal city if you are visiting the studios then this is the hotel to stay in book early as it is a busy hotel;4
room was small not use to the new york style rooms but all in all nice hotel close to times square and shopping areas staff was very nice two restaurants right in the hotel for convenience and mcdonald right across the street from the hotel;4
stayed in the new yorker in feb 2013 and been to nyc since and realised what a little gem of a hotel it is basic rooms but enough for your needs when in nyc if you spend too much time in your hotel you are doing nyc wrong beautiful lobby area and great in house dinner with tick tock being great place to start your day massive portions location couldnt be better right in the centre of all of the action quick walks to times square and the high line only time we got subway was going to financial district nipped back in when was staying in dec 2016 and was nicely renovated from when i had prev stayed made mistake of staying hotel pen this time i will be returning to new yorker on my next visit;4
hotel lobby and room were clean staff was very friendly the only negative was that our television picture was scrambled on every channel i reported it to the front desk and they never fixed the problem;4
we had a really good stay at hilton the staff was polite and friendly the rooms big the pool area not crowded and it was very close to universal studios and universal city the hotel is also close to the metro and the red line takes you right into the heart of hollywood parking was a bit expensive and the breakfast at cafe sierra was not worth the price;4
this hotel is a great choice if you are visiting the la area it is across the street from universal studios you can walk over or take the shuttle that runs every 15 minutes it is a short walk down the hill tough walk up though to the red line metro stop we used the metro several times to get to attractions such as the walk of fame and to a dodgers game the hotel is right off the 101 freeway making it convenient to drive to the rooms are clean and comfortable and all have a great view the hotel was a great value for the money my only critcism is the prices at the restaurant and bar a very extensive breakfast buffet was available however we wanted to stick to the menu 700 for a cup of tea not too bad if you are only staying a few days but pricey when you are;4
the new yorker is in a great area easy to walk to the empire state or times square etc our room was pretty small but im not the kind of person that spends long in the room i just use it as a base the decor was nice and it was comfortable and it didnt take long for the air con to cool the room or then the heating heat it up again when you wanted to be a bit cosier there was a nice little diner called tick tock which you could access from the hotel lobby or from outside the hote hotel staff were very helpful too;4
had a lovely stay at the empire it was clean tidy and good service the rooms were cleaned daily and new sheets and towels if needed the one and only problem we had was new years eve they expected is to pay 150 dollars each to go into the residents bar which i thought was over the top as we were staying there;4
the happy couple selected the empire for their out of town guests my wife and i were very pleased with the hotel the staff lobby bar and roof deck reception excellent value great location across from lincoln center all the staff were responsive and helpful during our stay wed stay there again bed comfortable a little street noise but thats unavoidable;4
i was in nyc with my wife late 40s for a second city break for 4 days good the hotel is old and outdated and needs a full refit some will see that as bad but i love the old art deco styling see photos staff were very helpful lifts were good like 56 for floors 120 and other side for 2140 only had a longish wait once onsite restaurant food is good as is the ticktock diner albeit expensive location is excellent certainly from transport perspective penn station is round corner which is a main hub you can get easily to jfk via airtrain lirr subway beds are amazing so comfortable we both had great sleeps bad rooms very small we upgraded to a room with a view not sure about that not a fault with hotel per se but the area stinks of weed like every;4
very clean and modern property in the heart of midtown i would give the staff ten stars if i could majid who checked us in after a long hot morning of travel is a cheerful professional with a refreshing dry sense of humor on the day we left bellman and keeperoftheportal jeff stored our luggage for the day so we wouldnt have to drag it around the city before our return trip the rooms are on the small side which only matters if you plan to practice ballet or tai chi in your room otherwise the rates are astonishingly low for the location and quality they have a fitness center for that anyway;4
we came here for an event instead of as hotel guests the hotel is really close to the universal studio together with several other hiend hotels the venue looks great and the service was good you have to pay to park in the garage but this is totally understandable and expected;4
the wyndham is ideally located to penn station and many sites staff were very efficient and willing to help we paid extra to get an updated room which im not sure was worth it we ate at the tick tok restaurant which is connected to the hotel twice very convenient and reasonable;4
amazing location friendly staff clean rooms it be nice if they had an iron and a coffee maker in the room if you are traveling with friends or significant other empire hotel is a perfect place to stay;4
room was small bed comfortable bit rundown no bedbugs and to our surprise very quiet maybe we were to exhausted to wake we found it served our purpose well we didnt fly for 15hrs in cattle class to sleep we came to explore so we were seldom there after an overseas trip on a tight budget you realise that one of the most important criteria is access to public transport the days hotel is adjacent to the ny subway and with a 7 day metro pass only 30 we never seemed to get off the trains and busses on our uptown downtown 5 day exploration the subway is great for zipping here and there with the added bonus of a bus if you want to go crosstown right accross the road is a deli and a coin laundry do your washing there they are hard to find no problems with staff just;4
i liked to stay at ameritania at times square good service excellent staff very good value excellent location you can enjoy the area but the room isnâ´t clean every day we didnâ´t have soap shampoo;4
though the neighborhood is not one of las finest the hotel is in a great location if youre looking to see all the tourist sites its only a threestop metro ride to hollywoodhighlands manns chinese theater etc which is excellent the room was clean and had all the amenities you need in a hotel hairdryer toiletries etc i would recommend requesting a second or thirdfloor room as theres a nightclub on the ground floor that is a bit loud however if you put the fan on at night you cant hear anything the continental breakfast is not bad nothing to write home about but you can get a pretty basic meal to start your day the variety was actually more than i expected if youre looking for a hotel on a budget that gives you the freedom to see la this is;4
we stayed here for a week and the location was fantastic easy walking to all the sights hotel had its own diner which was open 24 hours and a restaurant as well we were on 36th floor our room was quiet small but it was clean and room service changed towels daily and made up beds would definitely stay there again but maybe upgrade our metro room to something slightly larger;4
we booked this hotel based on price and location so its not the plaza but we did not pay plaza prices some reviews are a little harsh on this wee jem its cheap and chearful great location with subways 2 mins away rooms are small and basic but spotlessly clean with clean bedding and towels every day air con a little noisy but worked well and kept the room cool extremely helpful and friendly staff and a great deli at the end of the street with more than you could ask for if your looking for a great base to get around new york then i cant fault this place i would definitely stay again and have nothing negative to say if your looking for luxury then you have to pay for it dont write a bad review when you have not paid premium prices its basic clean good;4
ive booked one night in this hotel as i was in the city for a few business meetings and that was a very good choice the hotel is very well located the room was clean and had a decent size in addition to that mr ze from the front desk was very nice and helpful;4
after i booked a nonrefundable stay at hollywood hotel to attend a concert up the road at the greek theatre i started to read the bad reviews and panicked i usually read the reviews and then book but i was excited to go to the show with my love and jumpedthegun so after reading the bad reviews i psyched myself out and then psyched out my companion before we got there thinking that we were going to a cheesy motel in a terrible neighborhood with rooms covered in cockroaches none of that were true its not a bad neighborhood anymore the hotel is very convenient to the greek theatre and griffith parkgriffith observatory checking in was convenient and quick and the lobby was tasteful and updated the staff were all extremely polite and nice our room was small but;4
we stayed at this hotel for only one night but wished we couldve stayed longerwe were on vacation in las vegas and we decided a day trip to la would be nice however once we arrived we wanted to stay so we booked a night at this lovely hotel we had a huge suitewas very clean and nice with a wonderful view of the hills the staff seemed somewhat distantlike they were in their own world but overall id say this hotel was great and i would definitely stay here again and again and again;4
really enjoyed our experience hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were great really helpful also in a great location really close walking distance to times square but far enough away not to hear it over all a great experience;4
had a bumpy start but a great stay overall doormen are great and always courteous when entering i believe the front desk was having computer issues because it did take me over 20m to get checked in they were very apologetic which for me goes a really long way room was what i remember with a view of lincoln center very nice you have to be ok with a little bit of a stiff bed mattresses are not super soft location location location youre across the street from lincoln center and the 1 train that will take you way downtown additionally youre 2 blocks away from central park the location is great and not over congested like it is down in times square i totally recommend this hotel;4
lovely clean rooms very helpful staff modern design which isnât to my taste but when youâre out and about all day it doesnât matter bed is like sleeping on a cloud bar man was very friendly would use again;4
great location super helpful staff very clean and comfortable not fancy and a little dated but economical and just perfect for us walking distance to everything but at the same time a few steps away from the mayhem of times square satisfied customers;4
the hotel was fine a little pricey but we were in midtown manhattan and everyone said that we paid an average rate for the area our travel information all had us checking in on the 11th however when we got there their system had us checking in on the 1st they were able to get is a room by checkin time and an upgrade to boot the room was nice though smaller than we anticipated we did not avail ourselves of any inroom amenities the hotel was within easy walking distance of many things we wanted to do and close proximity to the subway took care of everything else;4
the room had some small deficiencies nit clean under the air condition no shower curtain the curtain was not to open fully the bed were absolutely clean and comfortable all stuff members very friendly and helpful a top located hotel with a easy and friendly atmosphere the right place for a holiday without much fuss about i have enjoyed it think of coming again;4
if you are going to universal studios hollywood and looking for an overnight stay this is the closest hotel to this attraction just a short walk or you have the option to take the free shuttle to the park the room was dated but comfortable the only thing that we did not like is that their buffet is near the lobby and the foods were displayed where people are walking back and fort with luggages or going to and from meetings or other events they should have separated the buffet away from foot traffic we could even smell the seafood inside the elevator;4
the empire hotel truly is a fun boutique hotel in the heart of nyc it is in close proximity to lincoln center central park and many fun shops and restaurants plus the hotel is just a block away from a subway stop which makes the location even more convenient the hotel offered everything youd need and the staff were very helpful nick checked me into the hotel offered me a city map and guidance on moving about the city;4
for those visiting universal studios the location can not be beat we spent 2 days in la and were grateful to be within a 510 minute walk to the park and universal city walk they also offer a free shuttle service if youd prefer to be dropped of at the gate staff was friendly rooms were fine clean comfy the only negative comments i have would be about the mediocre shower and the very expensive breakfast not included in our booking;4
great location and great neighborhood with easy access to all places you want to go in nyc on foot or by train room is also good but as many previous guests had complained the shower room does not have a full shower doorcurtain which makes the floor wet if youre not too careful i will consider staying there again next time;4
we stayed at the new yorker the first weekend in december and really enjoyed it it was very convenient the subway was right there and it was a easy walk to macys the hotel staff was amazing not only did they check key cards which made me feel much safer but they were a lifesaver when our car service left us stranded;4
the hotel itself is in a fantastic location for everything to need to in new york especially if you are planning to see all those sights empire state maddison sq gdn etc etc it was very clean but just needs somes tlc in places;4
we stayed at the hotel for 3 nights after visiting family on arrival there was a queue at the check in desk however mohammed took us over to a separate desk and checked us in his service is impeccable he upgraded our room to one on a higher floor with a fabulous view of the empire state buildingwow the hotel is ideally placed for and within walking distance of penn station madison square gardens macyâs and times square we used the gray line tour bus which was good and enabled us to see all the sights we ate in the on site italian restaurant this was a good meal and they made a decent cocktail as did the bar in the banker restaurant our only disappointment was when we had a lunch in the tic toc diner on paying our bill the waiter actually asked for a large tip;4
we stayed at this hotel in jan this year the entrance of the hotel is beautiful the staff where all very friendly and their is always 1 person that checks ur room key before you get on the elevator to make sure your staying at the hotel the room we stayed in was not overly big but we only laid our heads so it served its purpose the room view was over looking maddison sq gdns which was lovely at night the room was cleaned and bed made every day i enjoyed my stay here and would stay again for sure its quite central to like i said a stone throw from maddison sq gdns and about 510 mins walk from time square lovely;4
we spent a weekend at the empire and would certainly stay there again our trip included a show and the opera the proximity to lincoln center the park and the subway was great there were plenty of places to eat nearby with good food and ny reasonable prices the hotel has a dark motif in the public areas and the rooms that felt appropriate for december staff were pleasant and accommodating our room was small but it is manhattan we were able to manage perfectly well we had a room away from the street as with other reviewers the resulting quiet was a good tradeoff that we would recommend;4
i stayed at the jane over halloween weekend 2014 and id stay again i was travelling alone so the cosy single room was fine for me youre in new york city why on earth would you need a huge room when youre hardly going to be in there the space was still used economically and i never felt too hemmed in although im not sure i could cope in their bunk rooms with two people sharing the same space my main worry was sharing a shower and toilet facilities which ive never done before but i never met anyone in there during my six nights stay and the blocks were clean the hotel itself has a history and this has been played up in the decor which is oldschool wood pannelling and marble the faded glamour stuffed animals and shabbychic might not suit everyone but if you;4
i stayed two nights and found the staff goes above and beyond to meet the needs of their guests the room was large clean and very comfortable it was an easy 5 minute walk to universal city walk and universal studios plus they do offer a free shuttle every 15 minutes from the hotel to there as well but be careful it only runs until 4 pm during the winter months the only drawback i found was the price they charged to park your car overnight 20 self and 24 for valet i guess you would need to figure it into the price of your room when you are comparing room rates unfortunately i didnt;4
my sister and i stayed overnight to make it to an early morning show had never heard about this hotel but it was close to where we had to go in the am beautiful cozy inviting lobby barcafã© front desk extremely nice and helpful got a complimentary bottle of champagne and an upgraded room because we had gotten there so late and were really tired from the commute the room was very clean felt clean even walking barefoot on the carpet didnt feel creepy as most hotels do best shampoo and shower gel only thing is lighting if youre putting on makeup lighting is not good bed was the best omg the best night sleep best mattress and blankets we both slept like babies;4
hotel was nice especially concierge front desk worker was a jerk wish their was food option in hotel and more restrooms shower was modern and cool bed was decent near decent resturants which was great;4
travelled in july our room was very big clean and had a great view of the griffith observatory especially at night breakfast was served every morning and it was delicious especially the omelettes on the first night we were jetlagged and front desk was so patient with us and even recommended a pizza place up the road best pizza we ate during our month in the us the hotel was so convient as we could come and go as we pleased in our car a few minor issues it is a bit far from main tourist attractions although close to walk of fame however i think this relates to la in general its a big city neighbourhood seemed a bit seedy at night might have been just me but we were so tired we didnt go out much anyway loved it stayed on the recommendation of a friend and;4
i stayed at the hilton with my wife for a quick 3 day visit to la the hotel is convenient to the burbank airport it took about 35 minutes to drive from lax with sunday afternoon traffic follow directions to universal studios hollywood the hotel is the last driveway before entering the park area parking underground for 28 day is convenient 40 if you wish to valet check in was speedy from very friendly staff we stayed in a 21st floor room with a nice view of la for whatever that is worth note that most of universal studios is indoor attractions so theres not a lot to see from park views we were in an executive floor which doesnt mean a whole lot except for included continental breakfasts and a few extra room amenities we visited during a quiet time and are;4
stayed here with my friend for 5 nights check in was great staff very friendly and let us check in slightly early which was nice after a long flight slightly disappointed with room size rm 2141 and view but it was okay we had 2 double beds and we were not in the room much although i wish we had asked for an upgrade like others did but we still enjoyed our stay the location is fantastic and i loved the history of the hotel which you can read about downstairs the staff were all very pleasant and approachable and security was good as you cannot access the lifts without showing your room cards we only ate in the tick tock diner once but the food was good and the service was great we would definitely return to the hotel but i would like a bigger room next time itâs a great;4
we stayed at the new yorker for 3 days itâs very nice and clean our room 2 people was small but useable clean well presented great cleaning staff the only gripe would be the shower it was very poor and needs an upgrade good location and great restaurant right next door open 24 hours i think;4
we enjoyed our stay at the hilton hotel was very clean and staff were very friendly bar in the hotel lobby had a happy hour which was 47 mon thursday which served cheeses and crackers egg rolls and pot stickers for appetizers hotel has great location if your considering going to universal and city walk we really had no issues with this hotel it was comfortable convenient and friendly we would definitely return and recommend;4
great friendly staff nice comfortable corner room hotel overall was quiet and nicely decorated and the lobby was a nice place to chill and hang out made our fivenight nyc getaway a great one thank you;4
very nice hotel and location for fordham businessvisit only issues were the beds were a bit firm for my taste and the street noise was loud but it was a friday night maybe some noise machines rain waves woods etc should be provided;4
went there with my 2 kids overall the hotel was very nice and was very much within walking distance from times square also within walking distance to restaurants and shops our room was nice although somewhat small and clean for the most part the only big issue i saw with cleanliness was on the grate of the ac heat unit the staff was also very friendly and accommodating so overall a good stay and i would highly recommend it;4
aj was great at the front desk made what we needed happen location is the best too thanks aj great job we really appreciated you going the extra mile to make our stay accommodating and comfortable;4
parking was worth it staff from valet parking though check out were courteous and helpful i enjoyed the art deco style i thought the bathroom had charm and the view was the empire building it was close to the theater i did not get a chance to check out the gym and the only disappointment was no pool;4
this hotel got the job done granted we only stayed to shower and sleep the rooms were small but the bed was comfortable the shower was hot and had enough room to move we had enough towels the place was right next to central park in a very clean and family friendly area it is closer to uptown not within walking distance to normal tourist attractions like time square and what not its about a 15 cab ride to those places if you want to be spoiled in your rooms dont come here however if your plan is to explore ny and just need a place to stay for a relatively inexpensive price its perfect;4
the jane hotel is supreme in its service for the overnight solution for city goers i can say i would not want to spend a week in the small stateroom like hotel room but for a last minute incredibly affordable deal it did just the trick the old maritime hotel location still keeps its charm while everything felt clean and fresh the down the hall toilets and showers were no problem and added a sense of europe to my local stay cafe gitane which is in the hotel quenched my appetite perfectly without having to venture far;4
we stayed here for one night before visiting universal studios the following day we used the self parking which is in a large garage underneath the hotel it was quite a walk from the lifts that come from from the garage to reception and then you walk further across to the lifts that take you to the hotel rooms there is also a carpeted lounge area between the two just before you get to reception which was a pain when trying to wheeled luggage check in was easy and we had a high floor room with a great view the room itself was large spacious well maintained and seemed clean we found the room the be very quiet and we slept well in the comfortable bed after check in we thought we would have a walk over to city walk to have a look around we asked a member of staff;4
the rooms are huge well at least the suite i had was sprawling views of the hills and mountains along with the theme parks excellent room service and lots of plush bedding shower was very clean and the room smelled excellent great place and a little pricey;4
so the hotel was nice was in good shape really only a couple of things should have more than one shuttle and donât charge for internet other than that any others are really small stuff the person that checked us in could of been better trained the doorman was really good at his job;4
we stayed at the new yorker this week for just one night it certainly isnt a 4 stars in the sense of a almost luxury hotel in a scale of 1 to 5 however the staff was super friendly location was perfect for us coming by train is a 3 min walk from the penn station and close to everywhere we wanted to go in manhattan room was small but very comfortable bed felt like a cloud shower was nice and warm and everything was clean all the above yelds a 4 star on our book again we are not judging on luxury but services and comfort we recommend it if you are on a budget and need somewhere clean cozy and friendly to stay;4
stayed at the hotel for 6 nights check in was easy and the staff very friendly location is great with times square and central park a short walk away room was lovely and clean bathroom was modern and a good shower staff was very helpful and arranged our taxi back to the airport will definitely stay at this hotel again;4
overall a very nice experience in nyc i just cannot give 5 stars to a small room with a tiny bathroom the shower was great once we learned how to use it view was good lincoln center bedding was excellent coffee in the am on the roof deck was a wonderful experience location to central park lincoln center was perfect i would love to have given empire 5 stars you cannot make the rooms or bathrooms larger but you could add some hooks for towels and glassware or plasticware for drinks in the room;4
me and my husband recently stayed in this hotel for 6 nights we found the room to be dated but was very clean and spacious the bed was extremely comfortable which ensured we slept like a log after all our walking we found it to be very quiet in the room with no noise at all the hotel staff were always smiling and helpful particularly the chambermaids i would definitely recommend this hotel as its very central the only downside is that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room;4
hotel is clean with fresh towels provided each morning view from room was good on the 20th floor staff are friendly and helpful including the room maids security is good and not to intrusive or inconvenient great location 1015 minutes from times square on foot maceys slightly less penn subway 2 minutes and madison square garden across the street the on site diner tick tock serves good food at fairly reasonable prices and is convenient the only negative point could hear the taps and shower being used in the adjoining room either late at night or early next morning;4
booked as part of an expedia flight hotel package and as such seemed good value front desk staff very helpful allowed my mother into the room even though she wasnt on the reservation shed arrived a couple of hours before us consistently personable and helpful throughout our stay as were all the staff we encountered the decor is jungle inspired and tastefully done though the public spaces feel a little dark as you might expect in new york space is at a premium and the rooms are a little compact we had a superior double with nice views up and down broadway though small by out of town standards the room was nicely finished and very clean when we needed an iron is was brought promptly but of course there wasnt much room to store the ironing board when we;4
the rooms werent overly big or fancy when we stayed i understand they have been remodelled sincebut has a prime location near madison square penn station and other sights that are within walking distance if you dont mind walking to explore the city a short cab ride from the port authority bussubway nice little reataurantcafe attached times square and 42nd street busy commercial area near times squarenot too far away i was really impressed with the friendliness of the people of new york not anything like theyre made out to be loved the citythe peoplethe sights tip take a tour of the city hop on hop off type we took city lights 2 day tour but there are others and you can get these online or from street guys they have traffic vests and id a lot on 42nd;4
great room very big with two queen beds great location for visiting all of new york just a straight walk to time square staff were helpful and always there when you needed them it was a stones throw from madison square garden and the bus terminal;4
tiny single and double rooms decorated as cabins small and a bit old and worn but comfortable situated in a trendy neighborhood and round the corner from the whitney museum and the high line terrace with a great happy hour and beautiful views of the river reasonably priced;4
very friendly staff and great location room and facilities were very clean the hotel is an easy walk from times square central park and hells kitchen due to its proximity to bars and restaurants its a little loud throughout the night but that proximity could also be a plus for many travelers seeking nightlife;4
if you want a hotel in a notsotouristy area thatâ´s the palce to be good service fantastic view to the central park helpful staff delivery service from delis and cafã©s surrounding perfect for a couple;4
a great hotel if you are visiting universal it is the closest universal hotel we arrived really early on an international flight and even though they were heavily booked they managed to rearrange things so we could check in early to shower and have a quick nap before our day at universal we were really appreciative of this there were also lovely touches like delivering a newspaper every morning and a fruit plate our first night thereâ we were a little nervous of traveling around la at night so for us this was perfect as we could head up to city walk for dinner and shopping and feel completely safe in saying that we decided to hang around the walk of fame in hollywood after a tour one day and it was only one metro stop 150 away from universal stop very handy;4
i had a great time at the jane hotel located in the cultural hub of the mepa district and a short stroll into chelsea and grenwich village there was always something happening in this exciting part of nyc although a little far away from the nearest subway stop and even buses there is so much to see as you walk there you hardley notice staff are friendly and the rooms always clean be warned as everyone has mentioned the rooms are tiny and if your the sort of person who likes to spread your things out then you may want to opt for one of the larger rooms or another hotel my experiance here was the best that i had in nyc and i will definently recommend this to any single traveller thank you jane hotel;4
great location with easy access to transportation midtown shopping etc rooms are small but renovated and cleanbathrooms are tiny and the sinks are super small but had a corner room and it had a small seating area which made the room seem larger2 closets was a pluslive locally but stayed with family that came in for a few days and 3 of us shared a room and it was somewhat tightfull size beds instead of queens in this room which isnt bad if youre not hsaring with someone;4
this is a great vacation snooze joint for those traveling on a tight budget i was in room 3621 and i couldnât have asked for a better room mine had one of the most beautiful views of the city the housekeeping team is incredible they are doing the most tip ask for corner rooms with a view of the rockefeller center and empire state building nb i thought it could use mini bars in the rooms though;4

we stayed here in the summer at the end of a road trip great location walk to cpark near subway the roof terrace is uber trendy and becomes some sort of club at night everything in the room is extra so no water or teacoffee making facilities unless you want to bankrupt yourself the room was small but comfy and clean staff here are lovely i was helped to retrieve my kindle which i had left at atlanta and the staff there were useless minerva let me use her phone and then took over to help me we also had a late checkout so we could enjoy our last day in nyc and get a showers before flying back to uk would def stay again;4
if you want gorgeous and luxury this is the place to be enjoyed my stay even though it was for only one night the lobby was more luxurious than the rooms i would stay there again on my next business trip with buzz pop cocktails to los angeles;4
ate dinner in restaurant twice service unbelievably slow waiter called me sweetheart and lovei found that disrespectful catch of the day was stated as one item they served a completely different item without consulting me basic hamburger fries fries were good dennys has better burgers at a fraction of the cost cold microwaved food this restaurant has no visible kitchen i will seek different lodgings next trip;4
people at the checkincheck out counter look very professional but dont be fooled by their looks i puchased 2 nights stay at hilton universal studios through getaroomcom 3 months before departure from australia au 41003 including conversion commission of au 1194 was taken off my american express account that very day little problem arriving very early at the hotel on april 15 2012 after 14 hrs flight from brisbane our room was not ready of course 600 am too early they put our luggage at their storage no problem like zoombies my husband and i went to the universal studios across the main road to kill the time we came back to the hotel at 100pm had meal at the hotel and were pleased to be;4
comfortable clean rooms queen size rooms are very small book a king size bed room if you can jeff the doorman is super helpful hotel is near the action but away from the overwhelming crowds of time square good value dont stay in new york if street noise bothers you i am quite use to city sounds but heard a lot of guests complain to the hotel staff about the noise such as sirens and horns which you cant escape in new york;4
stayed for 4 nights and was very impressed arrived midmorning from australia and had no problems checking in early which was really appreciated staff were efficient and very obliging room was of a good size and the facilities were fine and the room spotless location is convenient to the red line metro vermontsanta monica stn and so access is excellent for universal studios etc there are some great restaurants nearby i can recommend palermo and kitchen self service breakfast was fine it can get a bit hectic at peak timei cant praise the front desk staff enough they were so helpful and pleasant and they ensured the stay was as enjoyable as possible the swimming pool is behind the hotel and sits within a pleasant courtyard would definitely recommend a stay at;4
overall good but suite was not ready until 330 pm despite me registering at noon and requesting check in at 1 pm the day before via email also package left at concierge for me not delivered i had to fetch later in the evening after having them look for it;4
we stayed at astor on the park november 58th and our stay was great yes this hotel is older and rooms are a little small but if you are just looking for a clean comfortable place to take a shower and get a good nights sleep without breaking the bank then this is the perfect spot rooms and bathrooms were clean and had recently been renovated staff was great location was perfect just 2 blocks from the subway and in the vicinity of lots of great restaurants not to mention central park just across the street would definitely stay again;4
very modern looking hotel when you first walk in staff greets you at the door and our front desk check in person was very nice to us offered to show a map of the area even though we had been multiple times elevators were clean as were the hallways the room wasnt very big although thats to be expected in midtown nyc it was clean and had a view location was perfect 10 minute walk to times square close to many of the major theaters around there a little disappointed that the bar closed at 1130 on a saturday night but the bartender was very nice to compensate had two for one drink specials which was a welcome surprise for midtown hotel on a weekend its a bit noisy quite early but again its midtown manhattan its to be expected the one downside was;4
we just got back from a girls trip to nyc we booked two rooms for four people at the ameritania the doormen and front desk staff were all wonderful we did have a room on the fifth floor and had to buy earplugs because the street was noisier than we had expected the rooms and bathrooms were always very clean the only two negative things that i would like to note is that every day the housekeeping for one of our rooms forgot to supply washcloths so we had to call down to the desk every night and there is no ice machine on the floor so we had to call down for a bucket of ice each night as well other than that we had a wonderful stay great location if you want to be around everything but not in the heart of times square;4
terrible experience with reservations and checkin written confirmations did not match rate quoted attempted to assign us to a lower category of room than had been promised etc but in the end the stay was pleasant nice views thats one of this hotels great advantages certainly over anything in times square lincoln center with its beautiful plaza to the west and you have a nice view up broadway and columbus avenue as you look north on the down side those annoying shower units designed with only half a glass panel and the other half completely open so you have to shower like a ninja to avoid water spraying out single sink with modest shelf space even in the largest suites was a little surprising but livable strangely small armoire shelved such that;4
so i booked this hotel based on the photos i saw of the standard room with 2 beds on them you can see a spacious room with 2 windows i even payed a little more for the option that stated city view i travelled with my boyfriend and my brother and i wanted us to have a lot of space so we wouldnt feel like trapped in a small room the staff is nice and they check everyones temperature everytime you enter the hotel masks are also required in the common areas however when we got to our room it was tiny there was very little space between the end of the bed and the wall and there was only one window also the door to the bathroom wasnt closing properly we couldt lock it so it would remain closed i went to the front desk and explained about the bathroom door and showed;4
stayed here in april for 3 night myself and my wife had contacted the hotel to ask for a possible upgrade or a good view months in advance as it was a treat for my 40th didnt get one our room had a good view but not of the empire state which was a shame but didnt spend much time in it room was pretty small and bathroom needed updating but was overall pleased with it lobby of reception is very nice smaller than it looks on the pictures and there can be long lines at check in there is security near the many lifts who you have to show your room card to i welcomed this there is no coffeetea faciltities in your room but if you ask at reception you get one delivered and stocked up for free not sure why they dont just supply that anyway tic toc diner which is on the corner of;4
mohammed was too kind to set us up right as soon as we walked in at noon i will say the room is from an older design so dont expect any closet space or a large bathroom but we werent overly concerned about spending a lot of time there the room was clean but sink clogged a few times and faucet made a horrible noise when you first turned it on otherwise valets were wonderful and the was right for two nights so worth the stay to walk to b shows ts and excellent eateries will stay again for sure;4
we stayed here during a four night stay in augustthe hotel is in a great location a stones throw from madison square gardens we booked with thomas cook who in turn us expedia the hotel is very art decor 1920 s look and the lobby is very stylish checkin was very efficent although was told i had to pay 25 a day for premium wifi fitness centre which i was never going to use and also business centre again no use they told me this was mandatorywe were on the 36 floor with a view over the river which was good the rooms are small but have plenty of cupboard space but lack easy accessable plugs if you are using travel adaptors the room itself needs a bit of a spruce up which could be done without spoiling the hotel charmthebathroom was old in its look but it worked as;4
the hotel room was small but comfortable the shower was good it is pretty close to the subway i had a room only we came to see new york and its christmas lights mistake nothing like the pictures or films;4
i love this hotel full stop i love the art deco presentation and love the presence that it has on the skyline the first time we stayed we got upgraded into a queen suite on the 38th or 39th floor which was amazing huge suite with an absolutely incredible view of the city and of the empire state building the 2nd time we went we didnt get an upgrade and just had a small room with no real view which wasnt great at all so we have seen both sides of it despite being a little underwhelmed 2nd time round i would without hesitation stay here again because of location location location ive always preferred the west side of manhattan and you are just minutes from penn st station which has a lot of key subway routes for getting around abc 123 not to sound like;4
room on the 9th floor with views of the hills and the theme park room was clean and the beds comfortable room was quiet on our arrival at 9 am ish after 14 hr flight from sydney was offered early check in for 25 dollars extra gladly accepted and we all had a very good restful sleep hotel is short walk to universal studios and studio walk wifi is available for surcharge room tidied and towels replaced daily shower was very low flow as is the norm in hotels these days but was difficult to enjoy with such little water lifts being modernised as was the lobby some construction noise evident as we were passing through but certainly not heard on the 9th floor overall comfortable and courteous and friendly staff;4
we regularly stay at the empire from long island 5 minute walk to central park and excellent restaurants right across the street with bar boulud boulud sud fiorello italian the smith shun lee picholine atlantic grille on on our favorite constant quick stop is boulud epicerie for great salads sandwiches croissants delish gelatos and amazing pastries the rooftop bar is fantastic empire is our go to hotel when we are in town for any shows especially the ballet at lincoln ctr quick walk to bergdorf goodman is bonus fao scwarz century 21etc if you want to maximize your time in this hood then empire is for you;4
spacious hotel great location clean rooms prompt service nice variety on the room service menu consistent breakfast in the restaurant great snacks in the bar area friendly staff and quiet rooms the shower was leaky and we had some trouble with the thermostat late one night but the mechanic came right up to adjust thatâs service short walk to universal theme park and easily accessible to other popular spots;4
we stayed here the weekend of 911 in order to attend the 15 anniversary memorial events we found the hotel to be very nice and located across the street from penn station which made getting around easy beds were comfortable the room very clean and large any requests to the front desk promptly responded to price of a room was decent considering that we were there for the memorial and a weekend i found security to be tight requiring the showing of room key every time you had to get in the elevator this was comforting to me i would definitely recommend the wyndham new yorker and will stay there on my next visit;4
perfect value for money near to subway and excellent staff must for person looking for good budget hotel in nyc rooms are small but good for the price youre looking for and i must recommend this to everyone looking for good sleep in nyc within budget;4
this hotel was situated most beautifully on the west side of central park sadly we did not have a park view if we go again we would certainly request park view the hotel staff were absolutely marvellous helpful advising etc even when i was ooorly one day and stayed in bed all day they gave is china and cutlery to use so my husband could bring me some food in we met samuel a lot who helped us and assisted us whenever we asked my bath inbuilt plug was faulty and they got it fixed the same day thanksgiving so very pleased sadly the decor is very tired and not good in places some quite poor repairs around the entire building needs a complete redo redecoration and updating a big plus is that we walked every day in the park to get uptown to do our various trips;4
great location very friendly staff clean rooms only issue we had was we booked a room with a queen size been but were given a room with two double beds when we checkedin as they had oversold still the overall experience was pretty good and we would stay here again;4
i have stayed at the days innbroadway on 94th st before and i was recently reminded how much i was impressed with both the staff and location it is on the upper west side close to the metropolitan museum of art and the guggenheim museum just a beautiful walk east across central park there is also a wonderful deli right across the street and a couple of newly renovated restaurants i tend to spend most of my manhattan time south of 50th street and broadway and this hotel was very close to the 96th subway station that can get one to all parts downtown;4
we got a great price although our room was tiny however new bathroom bathrobe and coffee which not all room have elevators were always quick and wireless was fine perfect location and easy block from penn station no wait for cabs on that long line highly recommend;4
knowing that the cost was almost 12 a chain hotel stay i booked a larger room than i normally do the junior suite i thought that booking a larger room may increase my chance of a comfortable room on a higher floor with a good view i was not wrong the room was clean comfortable bed and pillows good clean bathroom with all standard amenities and at the end of the hall quiet still had some outside noise as expected with any hotel in nyc there were 2 ac units in room that provided a good continuous movement of air i enjoy the white noise of the ac units as it does help cover street noise easily and helps me sleep better what was especially nice was the ac units ran continuously so i didnt wake up like i normally do when typically hotel ac units kick on and off;4
the wyndham is only one short block from penn station and hence an easy walk with rolling luggage our room was reasonable size and adequately appointed no complaints security is good the tick tock diner opens into the hotel lobby also opens to the outside there is an ok restaurant in the hotel also this is a good midpriced hotel for a new york visit;4
this hotel was very nice you couldnt hear the planes the rooms were really spacious the bedspillows were comfy the lounge areas seemed very comfortable but the walls seemed thin i would stay here again and hope that i had a quieter floor the person in the next room played their tv loud or it was an argument at 330 am;4
loved the character and old charm of the hotel clean staff was professional and helpful with area information bathroom was small and towel rack needs to be removed from behind doorclose to toilet every time we went to use the restroom would hit our heads on the towel rack getting up from toilet and the door could not open all the way because of the towel rack this was just in the basic room may be different in larger rooms;4
the empire hotel is at a great location in lincoln center not as hectic as times square but easy access to everything in the city rooms are nice make sure you check the size as some rooms are small the chowder house at the hotel is very good we visit several times a year;4
stayed here for five nights and found the astor to be adequate for what we wanted the staff were friendly the room and the rest of the hotel clean with coffee and internet access in the basement the location is peaceful and a good escape from the madness of midtown manhattan and it is only a five minute walk to the subway 3 and a half blocks to rejoin the hordes the only downside we found was the room we were in 807 was quite small although other rooms did look bigger if youre looking for a hotel where everything is taken care of for you and you cant manage without your every whim being catered for immediately then look elsewhere the astor is a good basic hotel if you want somewhere to use as a base while exploring ny and good value for your money;4
this was my first trip to nyc i was referred to this hotel by a friend the staff was very helpful location was great right next to msg and penn station its an older hotel that has been remodeled nicely good beds bathroom was a little small but was nice view of the city was awesome i would stay here again because of the proximity also the tick toc cafe on site was excellent for breakfast;4
i was nervous about my booking here after seeing all the mixed reviews but we were very happy with our choice on arrival we were upgraded to a larger suite we did not ask for an upgrade but was told as we were staying for a week we would be free wifi too which was appreciated we were there during the heatwave and lost our power briefly in the morning but on our return it was sorted used the rooftop bar a couple of times and enjoyed the relaxed vibe drinks were pricy but so is everywhere in nyc we did not use the coffee pods and opted for starbucks and had that across at the seating outside ate at eds chowder house and it was delicious and the service was impeccable;4
perfect location in hells kitchen i always stay in this part of midtown its close enough to times square where i can just walk to watch my broadway plays and close enough to central park where i lime walking around hotel slightly dated but still has a fun vibrant lobby and bar small breakfast room my room did not come with breakfast it was an additional 11 for breakfast but hey im in nyc i could walk to any corner and get a great cheap breakfast great staff checkin was at 3pm but since i got in on the redeye they were kind enough to check me in got a room with 2 double beds very spacious and comfortable they later on moved me and my boyfriend to a room with a queen size bed on a higher floor but room was much smaller still nice and had all the comforts for;4
this hotel is in the perfect location for a stay in nyc its only a few blocks away from a lot of tourist areas you would want to see when visiting new york the rooms are quite small but a decent size unfortunately the one i was in didnt offer a fridge microwave or anything of that sort i am not sure if maybe the higher grade suites do offer this as i didnt want to eat out for every meal these things wouldve been nice all the staff i encountered were extremely helpful and friendly however for 3 of the 4 mornings i was there i had housekeeping knocking on my door even though i can the do not disturb sign on i did not appreciate being woken up to knocking to tell them i didnt need anything when the do not disturb sign is supposed to do that otherwise an;4
overall very well presented hotel which was very comfortable the staff were very helpful and friendly thanks go to vladk and maerad who gave us advise on getting metro cards and how to get around new york;4
overall a great stay but there was a messup of my room on the first day and it was fixed the next day i paid extra for a room and did not get it on the first day of my stay other than that i like to rooms and the beds were very nice to sleep in room service and guest services were very good;4
the reviews were hit and miss so i did not know what to think the hotel had a nice entrance adequate for the number of people in line parking is in the back of the building the room i was in was pretty big there was a microwave and frig in a cabinet the desk space was a little limited but that was not as much of an issue as traffic noise if you are a light sleeper you want to be on the courtyard side of the hallway breakfast was great happy hour did not happen due to the cold temperatures the sauna was great but broken on the third night tv locked up and it took an hour for the maintenance guy to come unplug the tv wait a minute and plug it back in;4
the newyorker suited our needs it is an old hotel with a lot of history rooms are very compact and not much has been renovated particularly the bathrooms which feature very old school taps which come with typical leaks and creaks great location to times square and events at madison square garden;4
we stayed here for 2 nights the hotel was clean and the beds were very comfortable we didnt have a view but there was no city noise even though we were on the 7th floor we had a great nights sleep within walking distance to everything but if you want to take the subway its right there the staff was very nice nothing to complain about except the 22 a night fee;4
i avoided this hotel for years because i thought it was away from the action in terms of la landmarks attractions and the better areas of town boy was i mistaken this was such a fantastic experience you can actually walk from the airport be careful for traffic if you do or take the shuttle for a short drive the rooms are massive especially compared to rooms that are available in the city rooms are cleaned and the staff is incredibly kind i found myself enjoying the experience of this hotel vastly more than i thought i would highly recommended;4
came to new york city for my girl friends 21st birthday had a great time on the pool deck with lyonel he was very fun and accommodating had a great time he made sure we always hada drink and felt at home;4
room was great but not as nice as expected couch and table were stained bed was comfortable the first night but were used to memory foam and could feel every move of our partner additionally the ac took a very long time to come on and the auto shutoff meant we woke up extremely warm and could not fall back asleep customer service was excellent food from the lounge was just ok i honestly expected the eggs benedict to be slightly better for the price we got a deal because we were here for a wedding like the hotel but definitely dont think the rooms are worth the full nightly cost the bathrobe i got was great in theory but was completely ripped to shreds like it got stuck in the dryer;4
we stayed 5 nights in this hotel for the price it was lovely not 4 or 5 star as you would think the furniture was quite basic but the room was quite big the breakfast was great good selection and lots of it the location is ok as it is in between the 2 main blvrd there is a great big car park in the back and a little pool as well;4
from the desk to the doorman everyone was friendly and attentive and very responsive and helpful there were a couple of problems in our room which were fixed very nicely and promptly while we were out most satisfactory;4
we stayed 5 nights at the wyndham on the positive side this hotel is in a fantastic location and our room was spotless and cleaned every day to a high standard on the negatives our room was very small and quite dated and our view consisted of a brick wall so that was disappointing if we did return i think i would pay the extra for a better view had breakfast in the tick tock diner twice and it was good and obviously very handy two drug stores and a mcdonalds are right outside the hotel too i would recommend this hotel to anyone who was new to the city who was looking for a central base;4
very good hotel close to everything you can possibly do and see in new york staff are amazing from the management to jeff on the door would certainly recommend this hotel to friends the rooms are modern but not spacious but then in new york you dont expect spacious but are cleaned daily one little thing that goes a long way for me was the way they treated an elderly lady called mary with the respect she deserves who lives in the hotel as she was an original tenant when it was apartments the way the staff cared for her ie checking on her if she didnt come down all day was fantastic she should consider herself a very lucky lady to have such caring people around her all in all book it and you wont be disapointed;4
we go every year to events at lincoln center events and stay at the empire it is so convenient rooms are adequate and affordable we dont stay in our rooms except to sleep thats all we request is that our rooms are clean quiet and comfortable no bells and whistles needed one of the staff galina was helpful and very courteous;4
all things considered this was a great choice for staying in la for one week for business meetings in various parts of the greater la area just wish the regency club was open since both my wife and i were living out of the hotel for one week they may also want to consider a breakfast and parking program rate;4
we are not big hilton fans but ill be fair in this review first you are staying here cause its a walk to us so the convenience is nice the hotel itself is clean has a decent pool and hottub and we had excellent drinks at the bar our room eh it was okay its definitely a very nice size great for familiesbut you can tell the rooms are occupied mostly by families so they are a bit worn the room was adequately clean but again its worn carpetbe sure to bring slippers id not walk barefoot on these babies the bed was comfortable the sheets are overly washedrigidbut i guess to be expected just be sure to wipe the room down with clorox sheets before you touch anything the reception staff was excellent friendly gave us a rundown on shuttle;4
loved the roomy deluxe double clean and bright bathroom endless hot water comfy bedding plenty of outlets for chargers super welcoming frontdesk clerks friendly doorman to greet you upon every departurearrival elevators worked efficiently wonderful location around the corner from the ed sullivan theater stephen colbert show and so many terrific restaurantsboth casual and a bit swankier a few blocks to a lovely entrance to central park easy access to subway as well no coffeemaker in room but very reasonable to get coffee via room service or one can visit the starbucks nearly across the street we would gladly stay at this hotel again;4
i love dit the room we had intinally was as wide as a double bed and as long i am a pensioner and ha to get up on bunk hilaroius and not pretty we knew what we were getting and i recommend make sure you see the ballroom and have adrink on the rooftop;4
great location for lincoln center comfortable room hot water and the usual comforts two issues broken window seal discovered when we came in late and room was freezing heat not available the elevators are also very slow;4
excellent location very good cleaning and is very quiet the building is a little old but everything works the price per night is cheap;4
booked for a second time as the hotel is close to main broadway theatres and easy access to subway ideally situated for tourists staff helpful and courteous breakfast expensive considering no cooked items other than eggs;4
yes the rooms are small and the bathrooms are shared but theyre also comfortable and clean and in manhattan the staff here were really friendly and the location is great its right next to the southern terminus of the high line and close to boutique shopping and places to eat i didnt spend a lot of time in my room as i was out all the time but it was perfectly comfortable for a nights sleep even if the bed is not a fullsize single and i think it represented a good value for money in manhattan i really liked the 1930s traincarriage stylish vibe of the hotel;4
the front desk staff were very helpful and kind our room was surprising spacious and even the bathroom was a comfortable size for a hotel in time square heres a tip the front desk girl suggestedwe were traveling with 4 people however it ended up being just my husband and me so we wanted to trade in our two full size bed for 1 queen the said to just keep the two full because the room is much bigger we ended up loving it cause there was so much room for our luggage and space to walk around bring a water bottle because they have a water dispenser downstairs;4
value for money great location friendly hotel no complimentary wifi or coffee which is a shame its just inside upper manhattan which is great near columbus circle central park and not too far to walk to time square 20 minutes;4
we had a clean and spacious family room one double and two singles with small tv decent shower and kettle the location is perfect for sightseeing and id recommend breakfast â£21 for 2 adults and 2 children good quality and lots of choice would have given 5 stars for quieter aircon and a king size bed;4
for travelers who look for hotels that focus and excel at the core facets of a stay look no further pros quiet room excellent bathroom and amenities comfortable bed respectful housekeeping staff cons ac is loud room charges could be more friendly if you are a visitor who is using the hotel to have a dead quiet sleep look for excellent shower quality and bathroom amenities then return to find a perfectly cleaned room ameritania cannot be beat at this price point;4
i chose this hotel for my first trip ever in nyc after learning it had took in titanic survivors and it did not disappoint theres a groom waiting for you on arrival helping you out with your luggage i had two huge suitcases so it was greatly appreciated the checkin is smooth then you get to discover your room and what a discovery absolutely charming the room are designed as cabins from a ship and youre transported back in time there are useful hooks to hang your clothes a safe big enough for all important belongings a space for your suitcases towels are included as well as a robe and water the ipod dock unfortunately isnt suitable for iphone 5 owners but its still a nice touch the rooms and the bathrooms are spotless i was staying at the 4th floor even;4
10 min walk from times square 5th avenue 1 block from central park 1 block from lincoln centre location is perfect great atmosphere really comfy beds shower small but really refreshing decor getting bit dated but overall loved it ive stayed 3 times and would go back;4
i took my daughter on a trip of a lifetimei did my reseach and picked the new yorker because it was moderately priced and because we took amtrak we literally walked one and a half blocks from the train stationso closesince we walked everywhere the hotel was a no brainerright in the heart of midtown manhattanthe hotel was ran just as a good hotel should bewe walked to empire statemacystimes square rockefeller centerand hudson yardhighlinethe edge observation tower just to name a few i recommend this hotel;4
loved the empire hotel rooms are small and could benefit from a few updates but you cant beat the location rooftop lounge and hotel staff the location is perfectly situated in midtown manhattan with an awesome view of lincoln center hotel staff was very helpful and friendly rooftop lounge was perfect for a nice girls night out;4
the hotel was basic corridors were in need of updating but rooms although small was clean bathroom was clean bed was very comfortable and sheets were crisp and spotless the hotel was ideal for exploring nyc;4
this hotel has a great location and is the best feature itâs directly across from madison square garden and penn station in midtown the hotel overall is very old and the rooms are tiny with saying that this is what was expected when i booked in as i didnât care about the room because i was visiting nyc and just needed a bed to sleep in it is priced accordingly the rooms are clean and functional it is very dated but has an old world retro charm check in and check out was a bit slow and could be improved the bed was very comfortable and the pillows also there is a safe in the room and a small wardrobe to be able to hang jackets etc bathroom is a shower over a bath and tiny no balcony or canât even open windows the ac worked great the attached diner was great and;4
hotel is a 2 minutes walk from the metro station which was very convenient neighborhood is a bit sketchy at night but so is most of hollywood room is comfortable if you dont mind squeaky beds there is a bus stop just outside the hotel 204 it was helpful when we needed to get to beverly center although you have to get off and change to another bus to get there a 99c store is nearby as well as a rite aid pharmacy and lots of nice eateries including a wendys restaurant front desk staff helped us receive several packages and kept them safe until we got back breakfast is great with waffles cereals and eggs prepared to your own taste spanish omelette plain omelets scrambled eggs and even egg whites it will keep you full most of the day we also rented a car from;4
i first heard of the empire hotel as a gossip girl fan and then it was in satc so when i saw the deal on travel republic for only â£600 for 5 nights in august i jumped at it the hotel is located really well 5 mins away from columbus circle 15 from times square and near a well connected subway line you can see central park from the roof as thats just 2 mins away there is a starbucks literally underneath it and a few other shops located on the main road from the subwaycolumbus circle the lincoln centre is on the door step we found the service to be efficient and very helpful when we arrived the air con in our room wasnt working properly and this was in the summer so we were moved to an alternative room immediately we managed to be in new york the same week as;4
our stay was great the beds and pillows were fantastic i appreciate comfortable beds as someone who has had multiple back surgeries sleep in comfort and woke up without pain;4
im really disappointed with the management of the hotel for keeping the lounge closed for no good reason not offering acceptable compensation unless the guest asks they are offering good buffet breakfast i enjoy more the one they usually offer in the lounge honestly;4
this hotel was great i was pleasantly surprised go across the expressway and check the staffs recommendations for restaurants;4
best deal in town if you can deal with the tiny room staff was very friendly and courteous rooms were nicely appointed with the barest of necessities room was extremely small with very little room to move around a person 6 feet tall or more may find this space and bed to be unacceptable be prepared to improvise on premise restaurant and disco you might not want a room near the discotheque on weekends shared bath options excellent location in west village with convenient taxi service cant beat the price i would definitely stay again;4
a very nice boutique hotel welcoming you on the arrival the hotel is really well located 2 minutes walking from central park and columbus circle the hall is great elegant with a lounge bar that serves superb cocktails till midnight and good music we arrived in the morning we were prepared to wait till the afternoon for having assigned our room and instead the check in responsible look for the rooms already made and gave us the two keys she was warm and professional at the same time we really appreciated her manner and cooperation the room is a new york style room very small with a microbathroom absolutely narrow but it has a standing shower an it is furbished with all the amenities you need as well as the minibar in the room full with champagne good wine;4
i visited new york for my 21st birthday we booked this hotel based on reviews we had read and its location location is perfectly central opposite the madison sq garden it provided excellent views we were within walking distance of everything and right next door to the subway station which we used every single day and really got the hang of it life saver excellent service and excellent wifi very clean bedroom was brilliant size with everything we could of wanted only negative which isnt really a negative just personal opinion is that the bathroom does need updating a little shabby and old fashioned looking with a poor shower never the less it did the job and we were happy as for the hotel over all it screams new york classic looking lobby spacious helpful;4
in a good neighborhood this efficiency hotel is a great bargain for new york city staff is caring and concerned about guests rooms may be small but youâre not going to spend your day in your room when youâre in new york city;4

i stayed at the empire on my recent visit to nyc great location near the park which is why i initially chose to stay there the rooms were a bit small but the staff made up for the minor disappointments from the reception to its lobby service everyone was always helpful and accommodating tommy g stood out always courteous and always greeting you with a smile thanks empire see you in the spring;4
if you love the park and wish to be away from the madness of midtown manhattan then this is the hotel for you directly opposite the lincolns centre and a 5 min stroll to the lincoln jazz centre you are greeted warmly by the receptionist who checks you in efficiently and you are too on your way up to your room using your security card the lobby itself is calm and has a bar attached the rooms are elegant and clean as is the shower and bathroom a view of the city depending on which floor you are on is great i was on the 11th if you have time on hand head up to the roof top bar its the best place to catch the sun set every evening and if the weather is good then sit out and luxuriate in the cool breeze the beds are comfortable the pillows allow for a good sleep the air;4
two weeks before my departure to nyc my airbnb host cancelled my reservation and suddenly i was in a rush to find a new place to stay with my mum and sister i came upon hotel ameritania during my search on tripadvisor and thought i would give it a try since it had a ton of positive reviews and wow i was so glad i did hotel ameritania is amazing i have lived in nyc and know the city in and out and therefore i was so glad to be in a hotel with such a great location columbus circle and central park are located just a few minutes from the hotel and it is also surrounded by a ton of places to eat especially the pizza place angelos on broadway right next to the hotel is a gem it couldnt have been located better the hotel is super clean and the staff is friendly and;4
the main reason for staying here was the location it just feels safe and is so convenient to universal studios warner bros vip tour the train and hollywood walk of fame the hotel is nice and the room was comfortable and very clean most of the staff were very lovely and helpful if i return to la i will choose this hotel again;4
this is the closest hotel to lax with regular and reliable shuttle service to and fro that was my main concern as i had a 6am flight the next morning the place itself is big and so modern its almost like walking into a scifi movie thats where the glitch comes in the room is nice and has all the expected amenities including plenty of outlets and usb charging units but it also works on the european system where you have to put your room key in a slot near the door for the wifi and most of the electrical stuff to work problem with the key card in the slot the lamp over my nighttable didnt quite shut off and if i removed it the outlets wouldnt work my solution was to simply pull the covers over my face one other complaint if you can call it that the;4
room booked was with a universal view looked like it had just been renovated very clean and fresh looking large room with 2 queens great view to universal bathroom large enough for a family of 4 and once again very tidy and clean pool area was nice breakfast was from the cafã© take away on the ground floor as the breakfast by hilton seemed quite expensive walk to universal studios was 10 min and so easy to do would stay here again;4
the location for visiting my daughter was perfectalso great setting right across from lincoln center and a nice small park in front of the hotelrooms were small but cleanmy biggest complaintsno coffee in room and no free internet in the roommaybe those are upgrades;4
check in was not all that smoothat 430pmour room was not readywe were offered 2 complementary drink vouchers to use at the baras well as being offered luggage storage âat no costâ for the next 2 hours while our room was made upthe staff were polite this hotel is in a very good location just near penn station and diagonally across from madison square garden and an easy walk to time square broadway and other places of interest our room was on the 11th floor overlooking 8th avenue with a view to the chrysler building which was lit up with red white blue lights for the labour day weekend it was a small room but had a super comfortable bed with great pillows also the shower pressure very good as was the ac the down side to this hotel is you could smell the oldness;4
close to the tube station hammersmith which connects you to the main touristic places in london perfect for people only looking for a place for resting after a tiring day of sightseeing do not expect a nice treatment from the staff;4
we have stayed here twice now in the last 10 years when visiting new york and both times have enjoyed our stay the hotel is an ideal base for a trip here with the rooms being basic but clean tidy and comfortable i would recommend to ask for a central park facing room as the view is great the staff were very helpful and friendly and our room was cleaned daily it is a great base to explore nyc with subways 100 yds away in both directions and only 10 mins to get in to time square they dont do breakfast but there is a deli 2 block away that provides fantatsic blts and cream cheese bagels if you dont fancy being awake until 3 am like in times square this hotel is perfect the wifi worked fine and was enough to skype our family back in the uk they do have coffee machines in;4
my 18 old daughter found this place we wanted something affordable comfortable and some what located in the center of things we wanted to see public transportation right down the road the rooms have been updated but the bathrooms have not its a great place for the price we felt safe and all the employees were great;4
returned to this property after staying on a previous trip hotel is very competitively priced for the market and has nice amenities access to the hotel is very easy on and off the freeway without major traffic on surface streets close proximity to city walk walking as well as shuttle service gives a nice variety of restaurants for business travelers self parking at this location is far from the elevators and front desk you need to take an elevator and walk through the convention section of the hotel rooms are neat and clean most of the furnishings are up to date lamps include outlets for easy charging bathrooms have stone countertops desks in rooms offer nice views and are very comfortable smaller flat screen televisions are in older cabinets and could use an;4
i booked my stay with 25000 reward points and boy was i surprised when i checked in and saw the tiny room no joke you had to step into the shower in order to close the bathroom door if left open you had to reach around the door to get toilet paper the room had to be 60 square feet if that the bed was very very comfortable the walls were nicely decorated no ice bucket in the room but room service brought it up there was a fresh rosebud in a vase the coffee in the room was not free it was about 930 when we checked in and crowds of people were headed for the nightclub yet the room was quiet all in all id say it was a nice hotel just steps from lincoln center just dont let them stick you in a room ending in 41 i really think it must have been a utility;4
you never know what a hotel listed on line as budget will be like but the empire was totally acceptable extremely friendly and professional staff the room was clean the beds comfortable the bathroom modern and clean location cant be beat;4
stayed here for one night watching a band in london and four adults needed a place to stay we booked a 4 person room which had 4 bunk beds wardrobe fridge tea and coffee facilities also in the room was cutlery plates bowls and cups which i thought was a great idea if we where going to use the kitchen or staying longer than 1 night the room was clean and warm reception staff very friendly we arrived home late 0030 and where able to buy snacks from the foyer food counter very good prices here 50p for crispschocolate â£100 for a samosa the next morning we used the communal showers basic room with individual showers in cubicles like a swimming pool changing room or similar parking on the street outside is free after 630pm free on sundays and a meter has;4
my wife and i spent a friday night at the jane based on reviews from fellow trip advisors we arrived mid afternoon and were able to find a free parking spot on the street a block from the hotel dont know if we were just lucky but it sure beat paying 50 at the parking garage across the street we were met at the door by a bell hop complete with the authentic outfit who helped us carry our bags up the steps to the lobby check in was fine although when i made the reservations with the hotel i specifically requested a king size bed but they had us in a room with a full size bed thankfully they were able to give a king bed if not that would have been a big negative the room was completely adequate and very oldfashioned in appearance which my wife really liked she;4
spent 2 nights at ameritania to celebrate a bachelorette the lobby was elegant and comfortable the room was perfect for what we needed the shower was amazing the fridge is stocked with overpriced drinks and no room to put your own items in though right around the corner from the late show and fiddler on the roof walking distance to everything jeff the bellman was very helpful in getting us transportation for less and taking care of our baggage while we spent the last few hours in the city;4
i enjoyed a 3 night stay here using it a as a base to explore manhattan for 3 days before attending a work conference on long island my impression of check in and the lobby were very good staff were friendly no issue with check in formalities and the lobby etc is very grand the room was a queen size double and perfectly adequate it was clean and everything in its place no particular view from my window but this did not bother me only issue i had was with the safe as i could not get it working i called reception and they sent someone up promptly to take a look i had noticed some reviews saying that the rooms were noisy noise transfer through walls etc i experienced no issue with this the room next door i think was bigger than mine and had a family with young;4
overall rated this well let me start with the not so goods noise its nyc and its an older building so no double glazing so bring ear plugs as takes a few nights to get used to noise we couldnt sleep two nights in so went down on middle of night and they kindly moved us great service water three of the eight mornings we were there we had to have cold shower we were with group of 14 and the first day it happened they said only small group had been impacted but 13 of us had cold shower so think it was bigger than they realised and maybe most people hadnt said anything we were only ones in our group that asked we didnt bother telling them after that about the other two days normal rooms and even the ones with a view and a bit more upgraded;4
great location for doing universal studios tip take free shuttle to universal studios or city walk they are walking distance from hotel but it take a good 15 minutes or so depending on how fit you are we got a free upgrade to a studios view nice room 2 queen beds universal studios view clean comfortable beds quiet great view of universal room dã©corfurniture fine by me nothing i would even slightly complain about im not there for the room dã©cor beautiful lobby and grounds friendly and helpful staff they are going through renovation of elevators so plan for additional time i am a hhonors member so wifi in room was free i didnt use the pool short trip and i ran out of time and we didnt use restaurants or fitness area so seek elsewhere for reviews;4
this is a fairly standard hotel in its price range in nyc it is near lincoln center has a well travelled lobby bar which gets busy enough to be on net a negative for guests of the hotel and has a decent restaurant everything works pretty well and it is run professionally by most standards the rooms are small but welcome to nyc happily at least some of the windows open it is close to central park and an easy walk to most midtown stuff;4
gisel and her team were friendly and accommodating they were also quick with recommendations in terms of amenities i had stayed at the sofitel immediately prior to checking in here so the disparity in class between the two establishments was rather noticeable having said that the service here was as great i was a little concerned about the number of junkies and homeless lounging in the immediate vicinity of the hotel in particular and this section of vermont ave in general however the 24hour front desk and security provided ample reassurance of safety;4
we stayed here for two nights as part of a twoweek nyc vacation where we stayed most of the time with friends at century apartments nearby at first we were given a low room facing broadway but when we complained about the lack of view we were given an 8th floor corner room facing broadway and w 63rd st we loved that room and we thought the service was good for instance a light bulb needed changing and the personnel arrived within minutes to change it the rooftop bar is excellent;4
things to know 1 of course rooms are small its an old hotel in nyc theyre lovely though a funky modernwoodsy thing going on 2 the pool is wellphotographed its about three feet wide by seven feet long a great splash spot for little ones but not much more 3 posh little bar downstairs they make a nice mojito 4 the club on the roof always has a line and a dress code which is hilarious if youre staying at the hotel they let you right in regardless of the way you dress its not a bad little night spot though if you want to stay close to home;4
overall this is a nice hotel in a good location particularly if you dont want to be in midtown or the times square area in addition they have valet parking which is a positive if you are driving the staff are very accomodating and gave us no problem when we had to change rooms due to a heating issue the price is very reasonable for ny and there is a significant discount when booking the nonrefundable rate that being said the bathrooms are very small and have literally no counter space and the shower doesnt have a full door completely open on half i did find this to be inconvenient given that we were in a junior suite and i was with my family of four if i could i would give this a 355;4
this hotel has lots of persona and on a great location easy and quick access to central park and metro to get you anywhere in nyc next to the lincoln center and across quaint small park adds uniqueness;4
room was small by any but new york standards but clean quiet and the wifi worked well i had an inside room which might have helped only downside was my room was hard to work in although it had a small desk there was barely room to sit and use my laptop otherwise a fine experience for solo travel or a couple as long as you dont want to do much aside from sleep in the room;4
this hotel has a lower âscoreâ than it deserves most nyc hotels are in older buildings that have some quirks as they do here but overall the rooms are lovely clean well decorated with comfortable beds and bedding the staff could not have been more accommodating they were fully booked and super busy with graduations and yet never neglected uswere totally attentive and helpful as we were a family group with several rooms and different ins and outs the hotel is super well located for anything on the upper west side or midtown west i highly recommend this hotel and would surely return there;4
we stayed 2 nights while visiting universal studios the room was nice but lacked towel bars and a fan in the bathroom i didnt want to pay the 30 for breakfast so i rented a microwave for 10 in the room and brought breakfast food with me the coffee maker in the room didnt work so went down to the lobby where there is a peats coffee bar i booked this hotel because they have a free shuttle and you can walk to the park there was no despot when i booked 6 months out and i could cancel up to 72h before checkin for those reasons i didnt mind paying the price for the room but it did look like they spent more money on the lobby than the rooms and for the money breakfast should be included;4
had a corner room for two nights september 21st and 22nd room was larger than expected and very comfortable had a great view of the universal studios entrance was a five minute walk to the front gates bathroom was a decent size and the pool was nice front desk check in was easy and the staff was friendly;4
very professional service a special mention goes to aneta and pasquale who gave me the kindest and nicest welcome after a long flight very comfortable room with all you need silent and warm i stayed very well here nice ny view from my window because the location is okay;4
i stayed in the ameritania hotel with my two daughters for a week sharing a room with two double beds the room was a good size with a nice bathroom and comfy beds we were on the 11th floor so street noise was minimal and the view from our room was interesting great location for getting to times square and central park the staff were friendly and helpful special thanks to jeff on the door who was great;4
stayed at this hotel early may brilliant location and great service highly recommended only there few days but did a tour new york in a day couldnt believe how much we covered our guide gill was funny and informative pizzeria flamagios opposite for inexpensive fresh italian food;4
i stayed at this hotel for a conference the conference services were quite good in terms of food service their av people needed a bit more coffee at times to keep up but the coffee was good so that shouldnt have been a problem the lobby presents a vision of a grand luxurious hotel then you get to the rooms ok i get it its manhattan i dont expect a villa but it took some adjusting to the small size the bathroom in particular is tiny but what redeems it all is the location close to tons of stuff and sitting right on top of a subway station so you can get to anywhere else maybe not the best value for your money but worth at least checking it out;4
we found the hotel convenient as we picked it to be close to the kaiser hospital to be with a family member facing major surgery between visits we were able to visit la by jumping on the metro and head just about anywhere the buffet breakfast at the hotel was an excellent start to the day and the staff was friendly and helpful the room was comfortable and clean except for not being a fan of feather pillows and plumbing noise we enjoyed our stay and were able to walk or take the metro anywhere we needed to go the weather was too cool to try the pool but it looked very nice yes we would stay there again;4
having read the reviews prior to travel i expected that some of the decor would be dated but in fact the main corridors need a major facelift room was ok but we had to pay extra for a view and the bathroom was small with very little space on which to put toiletries the toilet flush was extremely noisy we could hear the flush in rooms on either side of our room and it took quite a bit of twiddling to get the shower at a reasonable temperature which wasnt boiling hot or freezing cold floor in the bathroom needed a deep clean too especially around the edges that said the tick tock diner and the trattoria were brilliant amazing food;4
hotel was great the decor is a lovely boutique style decorated hotel the roomwas a wee bit small but lovely and the bed was so comfy the rooms were cleaned spotlessly everyday the doorman gave us the most valuable piece of info that you need in newyork how the street numbers workthis was the only reason we managed to find our way about the whole week the staff are very helpful but not in your face they leave you to come to them if you need them which we loved this place is in the theatre district a stone throw from times square and central park it was a perfect location for everything we didnt try the food but only because we ran out of time we will definitely stay here next time we visit nyc;4
i had mixed feelings about our booking after reading some of the reviews but i was pleasantly surprised we had a metro room with a city view on the 32nd floor the room was smaller than we are accustomed to but there were 4 of us and we had quite a bit of luggage as others have said it is an older hotel and she is showing her age but i could see where wyndham is slowly trying to make improvements had issues with the shower running hot and cold intermittentlybut no issues with water pressure the tick tock diner that is attached to the hotel has really good food had two meals there and ordered room service all very good location though is excellent madison square garden on the next corner penn stationpost office across the street from that one subway entrance;4
first time visiting new york and took the only place available pleasantly surprised to find this really nice spot that was conveniently located close to the 96th street subway stop warm and cosy rooms that kept us housed for the 6 nights need to get their act together with those lifts which are very dodgy but otherwise a really nice place to stay highly recommended;4
if youre going to attend an event at the lincoln center i highly recommend staying here we did an inspection of the room furniture bed walls etc we didnt see bed bugs and we didnt see any bites the next day or in the following days the only bummer was that the pool deck was closed i was hoping to get a shot of the lincoln center at night and the empire hotel sign pro location lincoln center is right across the street its also next to a starbucks if youre not picky about espresso and the smith yum we got the breakfast package the brunch was delicious and the service in the restaurant was excellent highly recommend staying here con the elevators were a bit slow i guess its the time of year but the pool deck was closed that has some;4
stayed in a double room on the 8th floor great size to the room much larger than a typical room in nyc bathroom was a little small but clean def felt like these rooms have been remodeled recently past 2yr the bar downstairs is very friendly and welcoming for a quick drink before heading out front desk unfortunately is a little rude during check in check out any questions maybe thats just the style here im from texas so maybe im bias towards some southern hospitality overall for the money a good stay 35 star style hotel the location is great easy to walk to msg and several restaurants;4
the jane is ace the rooms are mega tiny but very comfy and who comes to nyc to stay in their room anyway you get an ipod dock bottles of water everyday and the bathrooms are mega clean the staff are nice and very helpful and cafe gitane serves beer from yorkshire the area is very vibrant and very swank lots to see with the high line being round the corner great for people watching too the bar downstairs is very popular at the weekend despite the music policy is pretty wack although ill let the dj off for playing a tribe called quest followed by beastie boys head to lower east side bars for better music the bar itself is pretty kool though like a mad old british stately home with taxidermy and a roaring open fire a good greasy spoon type breakfast place is hectors;4
i went to new york last summer i know it says august 2013 and decided to stay at the empire hotel and i have to say that it was an excellent time now i came to new york to visit and savor the culture the food and the surroundings new york has to offer and knowing that the empire hotel is a walking distance towards few of its famous landmarks the lincoln centre and central park i was in heaven the room i got was upgraded from a twin to a queen size bed the day i checked in the staff were friendly and nice my room was near where the elevators are not recommendable but slept like a baby anyways and no problems with sleeping in a city that never sleeps the size of the room was small but that is not why i was in new york my room was my haven for resting after a;4
after reading some of the negative reviewswe were as others have said a little concernedbut these worries were soon forgotten the hotel was ideal for what we requiredgranted the room was on the small sidebut you had your own bathroom and shower and because you are out sight seeing all daya bed was all you needed the subway was only a short distance away aa was all the shopsdelis and resturants you needed for breakest or dinner the hotel staff were all very friendly and helpfulall in all a memorable first time in new york;4
we stayed at the empire because it was the closest hotel to our family that we were visiting and it was within walking distance it looked like a very nice hotel we did not use the bardining area at all but it looked very nice the hotel was very accomodating and the people very friendly our only issue was noise in the heater while we were sleeping it sounded like a small animal was crawling across the heater when we first heard it i jumped up to look the coils made a noise every once in a while that would always keep us awakethru the whole night im sure other rooms did not have that issue but ours did unfortunately i would definitely stay there again though just make sure the heater does not make noiselol we did not have any view from our room;4
this was just a very quick overnight stay prior to taking an am flight out of lax i usually stayed at hotels belonging to portfolios of my former employer i never really liked them but the price couldnt be beat freed from that i branched out to the hyatt regency i picked up the shuttle at the airport run by the nextdoor parking agency and was dropped off in the little alcove between the parking structure and the hyatt entrance i was instantly impressed the lobby is bright and modern even at 10pm the lobby was full of people working sitting at the bar enjoying conversation over beverages i love it when people actually use the lobbies instead of just stopping off for checking in and out it gives a good first impression when people are comfortable;4
lovely hotel in great location really close to the metro central park time sq broadway shops restaurants etc rooms are quite small and no drawer space pool is also more of a plunge pool than pool only real criticism is that the wifi is rubbish got better connection in local restaurants attractions couldnât upload trip advisor etc which was challenging when planning but staff helpful and printed tickets off for us etc would go back;4
friendly front desk staff help offset the length of time it takes to grab an elevator seems to be a favourite of school tours so the lobby is usually quite busy our room albeit small was very clean and the shower was fabulous a great location for times square and the theatre district thereâs a starbucks across the street if you prefer over the hotel breakfast which we didnât partake of have stayed here twice and will probably go again;4
i stayed for 4 days to participate of a conference the rooms are small but clean and warm the attendants are kind and humorous the location is great near of two subway stations and the hotel is in fron of the central park i was treated wonderfully certainly will be back and with my family;4
this was my second stay at this hotel i noticed some signs of renovation all hallways were freshly painted and bathrooms were remodeled as well i found rooms to be clean and staff very helpful this hotel is two blocks from subway station which is 72nd street and broadway about two blocks from hotel this hotel is located in a very quite upscale residential block this hotel consists of 3 buildings when you make a booking ask for north south building as that is the nicest among others;4
my wife and i booked the empire for a single night stay after a late evening in the lincoln center area on december 14th i reserved the room for 15000 on priceline and for the amount i paid it was a nice choice the hotel has undergone extensive renovation and although the rooms are europeanlevel small they are clean and serviceable we didnt use or check out the pool or the gym but the idea that a hotel in this area had such amenities was impressive youll find yourself 12 block from lincoln center which is a nice touch eds chowder house the restaurant downstairs has a nice buffet breakfast for the usual hotel overcharging price service at the front desk was friendly and the lobby was inviting the elevator i traveled in had a door that didnt open properly;4
the new yorker is a very traditional well located hotel in the heart of the world that is 34th st and 8 ave despite its immense number of rooms the elevators work reasonably with the exception of the period comprised between 7h4510h00 am you have got to bear this in mind if you are in a rush to take your train or a flight a very subtle tip would be to divide the numerous elevators 6 to each colums of 20 floors into a smaller number of floors each let us say 3 floors for each elevator that is the main reason for my 4star rating which made me very upset by the time i was checking out the keys are also very fragile in terms of losing their magnet as i had to change their code very frequently something annoying but on an average condition this hotel is;4
we booked one of the captains rooms with double bed and private bathroom lets face it the room is small but you are in the best location so have a shower and get out and enjoy it the staff are great the bar is fab and the cafe restaurant is excellent love this place in summer the rooms might get a bit warm it was unseasonably warm for september and we had the airconditioning on but it was still a bit warm the window is tiny;4
just stayed there we were greeted by a very helpful nick at the front desk he got us upgraded to a king room the room was relatively large by new york standards only a few annoying things 300 for a cup of do it yourself coffee most other places in ny provide this free and even though we had the do not disturb showing housekeeping knocked on our door and announced themselves at 900am on a sunday morning;4
we enjoyed our stay at this hotel we were picked up by the hotel shuttle service from the lax airport for no extra fee which was great the staff was friendly allowing us to check in early because our flight had landed much before the regular checkin time we wanted to consult the concierge to plan our outings in la but unfortunately the concierge was not available for some reason however a staff at the reception desk took out time to explain the city give us tips on things to see and do and for getting around in la and that was quite helpful the rooms are spacious and well appointed we could see airplanes take off and land at lax all day long from our room window and for my 6yearold that was fun at night we could shut out the lights coming in from the streets;4
we recently stated at wydham new yorker during our 1 week trip to new york the hotel was approximately 45 mins from jfk airport uber cost approximately 65 the hotel is located on 8th and 34th perfect location from here you are able to walk to macys and penn station within 5 minutes and times square within 10 there are several food options around including mcdonalds starbucks across the road and an amazing bagel bar on 35th both duane reid cvs pharmacies are next door also selling snacks and soft drinks most places around are open late if not 24hrs the staff were very informative however beware they will charge you a daily fee for phone use wifi and gym access we were told it was 26 per day but when we questioned this it was quickly reduced it to 10;4
convenient position near penn station clean comfortable hotel with staff on duty 247 free local and international calls from room free wi fi printer available all hotel facilities youd expect great coffee and croissant available in the lobby in the morning friendly staff good security rooms cleaned daily enjoyed my stay;4
this smart retro building on the upper west side is in a handy location if you want to hangout within easy reach of the shops and museums of uptown and its a nifty five minute walk to central park when you need to escape the traffic or join the cityâs army of exercise fanatics rooms are smart and tasteful with enough idiosyncratic design to make you feel youre in a smart chic boutique despite the hotels significant size i was upgraded to a large room on the 3rd floor which had space to work comfortably and even do a bit of yoga without knocking myself out and the free wifi was a relief having been outrageously charged by hotels too often recently annoyingly you have to keep putting the passcode in when using a mobile device which seemed pointless and after three;4
stayed for a few nights on business and was very happy with the large room and nicely appointed bathroom elevators arent the fastest but they arent the slowest either this is a fairly big hotel and has a full bar and restaurant along with a starbucks and snack offering counter the walk to universal studios is fairly short but does have some steep elevations and stairs to get up to the level of the theme park and citywalk not a big deal if you are in reasonable shape if you are a hufferpuffer you may want to take their free shuttle which is very reliable and frequent if you are driving it is a very short drive to get to a carls jr and innout nearby also a gas station to pick up food supplies if you dont want to pay the ridiculous room service charges for;4
the people at front desk where very friendly helpful they booked everything we wanted to see called cab when we needed one told us about good resturant to eat the free breakfast was more than i expected nice patio to relax clean friendly;4

this was my first time in nyc and couldnt have asked for a better play to stay great ambience helpful staff and comfortable rooms the conference room was very tastefully arranged and we had some excellent service from the staff highlight for me was the food im a vegetarian and they took special care of that will recommend this place to friends who visit nyc and would definitely go back and stay there given a chance;4
location is it biggest advantage about 5 minutes walk from hammersmith underground comfortable beds and clean linens they clean the place everyday the only downside is that they kitchen does not have any utensils for cooking also as i found in london there is a more than decent chance that there might be dicey guests in the hostel so a bit of luck is required for a good nights sleep overall great value for money;4
this large welllocated property is geared to the business traveler rapid transit elevators whisk you to your floor where your large contemporary king room awaits the desk inviting you to work while admiring the view from the 19th floor but the sofa says invite friends over for cocktails the sofa won after an evening with friends the comfy bed welcomed our weary heads lush towels as you would expect and a good cup of inroom coffee started the day off right downstairs the good times continued with valentin our breakfast waiter he was so patient as our group finally all arrived waded thru the diverse menu ordered there is also a huge buffet available for 23 food was all prepared nicely and was expensive no shock;4

my son had interviews at columbia medical and mt sinai we never needed a taxi to the medical centers or to and from penn station the subway and bus were minutes away the staff was very pleasant the hotel is older but the room was clean we had a refurbished room with a new bathroom and 2 queen size beds very comfortable older tvnot a lot of channels wifi with a strong signal the room was quiet although it has steam heat so sometimes you could hear the steam coming out of the valve there is no restaurant but across the street is the corner cafe for breakfast and broadway has many fine not too expensive restaurants nearby we walked at night on broadway it was very enjoyable duane reade next door is open 24 hours if you need virtually anything when i;4

very easy check in on a saturday afternoon room was clean and warm the new yorker is an older hotel that was refurbished a few years ago itâs nice nothing fancy the tic tock diner is always open and has decent food the bar in the lobby has good cocktails and better food the location of the hotel is great if your at the garden and a short walk to times square i would recommend this hotel;4
stayed at the hilton universal city in november 2016 we selected the hotel based on itâs proximity to universal studios hollywood check in was easy there is onsite underground parking 28 day there is an onsite restaurant did not use a lounge and a coffee kiosk the lobby is undergoing updating the elevators are in the midst of being upgraded we did not experience any long waits for an elevator the room itself was fine nothing spectacular but the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were well appointed everything was clean in terms of location to universal studios and citywalk the hotel is 2nd to none itâs a 10 minute walk at most from the door of the hotel to the security lines of universal studios you must cross one street via the crosswalk to access;4
wyndham new yorker clean and cozy room staff was awesome and the tic tick good food lovely lobby to sit and people watch close to everything to do in the city the doorman had taxis ready and available at all times;4
i would definitely go back here again it is not like the chain hotels but instead gives a real feel of what a new york hotel is like rooms are small but thats the reality of life in new york i lived there most my life and can say its a good stay there is a 24 hour cafe downstairs with great new york flavor diner type food and an asian restaurant around the corner excellent macys 34th street broadway madison sq gardens li railroad subway and times square etc a quick and beautiful close walk location is excellent;4
stayed here from 12 to 23 november 2016 from arriving to checking out the staff were polite professional and helpfull asked for a room with a view as this holiday was for my wifes 50th birthday we arrived early and room was not quite ready so they looked after the cases and we went for a wander on returning at 230 room was ready and we were given a room on 11th floor and there was some fizz provided by the hotel reception staff helped us out when we needed to contact the transfer company many thanks to ali yassir and especially to majid cheers for a great stay majid suggested a delicafe for us to visit while waiting for the room to be prepared and we went there most days for cooked breakfast it was that good susan our chambermaid was fantastic and changed sheets;4
lovely hotel but very busy good security in place close to everything clean rooms with good amenities but have to pay for internet does include long distance phone calls did not use the other amenities therefore cannot comment on that;4
the staff were nice friendly and helpful and i think went the extra mile letting us have a late check out as my flight was later on the next day when we could not get internet service a member of staff came all the way up to see if they could help us and we shortly after were able to;4
if youre looking for a place to store your bags and lay your head while you spend the days and evenings out doing stuff in nyc then you cant beat the price of this place we were 3 girls travelling together for 4 nights we had a 1 bedroom and got a great price we always felt safe in the hotel i shared a bed with one friend and the other slept on the couch the rooms were clean yes they could have used an update but they were clean which is all that we cared about they were hot as other reviewers have mentioned but we were there in march and so just opened up the windows the location was great just off a subway line at 72nd literally half a block and right at the same place a greys papaya hotdog restaurant remember fools rush in great hotdogs;4
pro excellent location reasonable price walking distance to almost everythingcons broken clock previously leaked ceiling might be just my roomsummary if the price is right it is a good place to stay for leisure;4
this hotel was nice and clean for a 4 night stay in july 2016 it is location very close to times square and good restaurants after reading previous reviews i was quite nervous about staying here on a business trip although it is old and the hotel smells a little musty all the rooms are updated my room was small but very clean the staff was exceptionally kinda also it is pretty quiet for a nyc hotel which was a nice surprise dont be scared by some other reviews on here its a clean hotel with a good location;4
best value for the location in ny big room fantastic view of the park from the balcony nice deli on the corner serving turkish food go to cafã©amrita on 110th street for the best blueberry pancakes weve ever had its a basic hotel but nice beds and bathroom great nights sleep and lovely staff;4
my boyfriend and i have stayed at the empire on two separate occasions on both stays we have had good experiences the rooms are fairly small what rooms arent in nyc but nicely decorated the bathroom is also very small and the open shower is a little incovenient on our second stay with empire we got stuck in a bad room but they were very accommodating and moved us to a higher and larger room overlooking lincoln center the rooftop bar is excellent and the lobby bar is great as well the location of the empire cant be beat we will be back;4
a beautiful sky scrapper property located at the heart of nyc the property is located at just 2 mins distance from the famous penn station 5 mins from the mesmerizing empire states building and 2 km from the happening times square at first sight it seems a old heritage building it is quite old but as soon as you enter the lobby its a whole new world with world class amenities a beautiful lobby awaits you as you behind the door the building has loads of floor with each floor hosting 100 rooms which quite astonishing we were given a room on the 23rd floor had a good enough view but felt a bit cramped for space but considering the count of rooms it had on the floor that could be understood the staff is courteous and was quite supportive for the entire stay the best;4
perfect location when wanting to visit universal stayed in a corner room which was big and comfortable for a family of four check in was simple with the staff who were very friendly underground on site parking was available for 25 a night which wasnt too bad the view from the hotel was great as it is on top of a hill highly recommend a stay here;4
perfect hotel for those wanting a great location for exploring london 100 metres to the london eye and sealife centre we hardly spent any time in the hotel but the room was comfortable and spacious and had everything we needed except a fridge which would have been really useful as we had a 2 year old with us breakfast was good exactly what you would expect and enough choices for what you are after very well priced as well the fact kids eat free was a bonus we have already said we would use the hotel again the next time we go to london for a short break as when you look at price and location it is a great option would have given 5 stars overall if there had been a fridge in the room ðð;4
it was quite a while ago now but thought i may as well give a review it is a very large hotel with so many rooms i dont think reception knew much about them but they persevered with our request until we found one with a view of the hudson river so we were happy in the end i was thrilled to stay there as it is quite iconic;4
the empire hotels rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished despite the fact that the building is old they have done a wonderful job of modernizing the lobby with a great bar and the restaurantlounge on the rooftop offers a great view of the city the bathrooms are a little small but you have everything you need and the shower is wonderful the staff is very accommodating and i was checked in by jeffrey who is polite friendly very helpful and remembered me from prior visits i was in room 1016 with a great view of lincoln center one of my favorite parts of the city;4
nice hotel very close to times square and broadway good base for visiting ny the room was clean and well appointed lack of a view but that didnt bother us the only thing that let it down was the breakfast;4
great night stay for the very helpful staff we were able to store our bags at checkout and go on our tours of ellis island and the statue of liberty location is awesome close to subway and a straight shot down to battery park for our tours a bonus was leaving at rush hour and being away from the thickest part of traffic quick exit and ride home;4
hotel was clean and comfortable centrally located with many things to do and great restaurants we didnt get to go to the rooftop bar but heard it had a nice view room service was not available the weekend september 29 2018 because they were undergoing renovation;4
they now have a regency lounge past check in they did not its very new not as complete as some other hyatt regency locations nice gym on the top floor with a view of the airport rooms nice but i pulled up my shades in room 301 to see lots and lots of dirt in between the inner and outer windows someone skipped a cleaning during renovation i imagine very fancy nouveau rooms i would rather a work desk than a little round table but tho not as comfy for work or as useful looks very cool nice to have a hyatt finally at lax now if they can only fix woh good wifi speeds;4
overall this place was very good with just a couple of things that kept me from giving it an excellent rating we requested one of the higher rooms so we could have a view and it was worth every penny the room was surprisingly big with a decent sized bed and plenty of room around it there was a desk and chair bedside drawers and wardrobe space the bathroom was a reasonable size with a shower over the bath wash hand basin toilet and a cabinet with towels in the heating was fantastic and believe me with snow on the ground and the windchill factor we certainly put it through its paces there was loads of hot water too the staff were polite friendly and went out of their way to help after we checked out we were able to store our bags there for a dollar;4
well appointed bedrooms with very comfy bed nicely decorated with microwave fridge and coffee makervery noisy extractor in the bathroom which can be annoying the reception area and breakfast rooms are spacious and well decorated breakfast was adequate for inclusive but the same thing every morning we found it strange that the hotel didnt seem to have a restaurant and information in the room indicated that you could have food from outside sources delivered to your room also the bar was only open on certain days when they then had open mike sessions this did not seem to reflect the size and quality of the hotel whatever we had a good stay reception staff were helpful and even printed our boarding pass for us we didnt have time to use the swimming pool but;4
new yorker is my favorite nyc hotel with inexpensive prices for very clean rooms friendly staff the ease of being next to moynahan penn station its in the middle of manhattan within walking distance of anything you need the hudson river anything you need in the hotel a call away everyone i have ever come across was friendly willing to help in my many stays over the years room service is provided by the tick tock diner itâs open 247 most of the rooms are updated yet still feature the unique art deco decor which was so popular when the hotel was built the tv cable arenât that great yet if your going to nyc to watch tv well enjoy;4
i stayed here in november 03 it is an older hotel so the decorfurniturebathroomelevators are not the greatest but we didnt have any major problems and in nyc for less than 100nt it was to be expected the best part of the hotel is the location only a few blocks from an express subway stop so you can be in times squaretheater district in two stops there are a lot of places to eat nearby and central park is only a few blocks away i would definitely stay there again;4
this hotel is a perfect location for nyc marathoners its close to subway to south ferry and only mere blocks from the finish line no need to hail a cab along with 50000 other runners good luck with that hotel is clean and service is fiine on a normal day the value isnt there as they charge for everything and the rooms are small elevators were slow too their late checkout is 1pm so marathoners need a second night stay you would think for 600night and 72 parking they would cut you a break considering the marathon event and demand related to that i would definitely stay here again for the marathon thats why i give the very good rating;4
this is a comfortable wellmaintained property just across from universal i did have a few quibbles though i had a 200 voucher from expedia which i ended up using to book our room i find it pretty poor that hilton would not award hilton honor points or provide free wifi because i had booked through expedia either work with expedia or dont dont make your customers who are paying a lot for this hotel feel like second class guests because they happened to book through expedia on one occasion this will not encourage me to book directly through hilton it will encourage me to book with marriott or another competitor the next time second please put towel racks in the bathrooms theres plenty of wall space unclear why there wasnt a single towel rack and;4
stayed here in december a year back with my sister and love it the rooms were warm and cleaned daily very spacious had a fantastic vie as we were so high up big double bed each 5 min walk to times square great pizza take away right across the road is a must visit asked for a kettle to be provided in the room but ended up getting a coffee machine this wasnt a problem and was a godsend after coming in from a cold night we didnt really have any dealings with any staff except on checking in and out but they were very pleasant i wouldnt stay again only because id like to try somewhere different on my next visit couldnt fault the hotel at all very clean and adored the art deco;4
we stayed here for 5 nights in july and found the hotel to be fantastic for our needs the location was great we received an early check in a bottle of bubbly on arrival and a big congratulations as it was the start of our honeymoon yes the hotel is older in style but we thought that it added to itâs charm the diner and bar attached were really handy for early morninglate night snacks drinks and the staff in both and the hotel were friendly helpful throughout the only small negative was very poor water pressure in the shower to be fair we didnât raise this as an issue with the hotel wasnât really a deal breaker for us for the short duration of the trip but could be improved we stayed on 21st floor and our room was really quiet peaceful would certainly recommend;4
older but iconic new york hotel and we loved the art deco style corridors to the bedrooms are a bit shabby but the room albeit on the small side was adequate and clean the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was dated but again it was clean and functional tik tok diner is worth a visit location is perfect would definitely stay again;4
we visited to celebrate my partners 40th birthday and found this hotel which is just two blocks from times square so a great location for tourists the hotel is smart clean with modern decor the rooms are a good size and despite its central location they are quiet and heavy curtains keep the light out we found the staff very responsive to queries providing a kettle to our room quickly upon request and even dropping a small cake and birthday note to my partner into our room there is also tea and coffee in the foyer for a lot of the day iâd definitely recommend it well priced for central new york;4
the hyatt regency lax is my goto hotel for lax stays the night before a flight its a great hotel with clean and recently refurbished rooms and it is walking distance to t13 tb but they also have an airport shuttle if you have multiple bagsclub lounge is also nice for a quickbite before heading over to the airport;4
stayed for 3 nights room size was ok working desk and small fridge were really helpful and the barhrokm was great service was good helpful staff and the location is great only problem was the noise from outside as windows do not block it;4
overall it was a good location esp if you are visiting universal studios we could see the place from our room and the bed was the most comfortable weve ever slept on also there was a 24hrs ralphs supermarket just 5min away so that made us happy other than that no complains about the room the hotel except i do agree that the front desk was slow and not exactly helpful;4
this was a good hotel with lots of personality staff were extremely helpful and requests were dealt with promptly i agree the rooms are smaller than is usual in america but they are nicely decorated and kept extremely clean the bar and lounge area are very striking and were very popular when we were there on the down side the paint on our bathroom door was flaking away which was hard to ignore and there was a charge for all extras including tea and coffee free wifi only available in the lobby;4
we spent 10 beautiful day there friendly staff good service and clean room close to the metro station the surronding places are not so elegant but this was not a problem for us;4
convenient location and ok price this was a perfect location for a short weekend in the city all of the conveniences including restaurants transportation near vamoose dropoff and pick up and entertainment were nearby the staff was pleasant we did have a little hiccup with the check in which we did not quite understand but it was quickly resolved something about third party charges are handled our room was available several hours before check in the checkout was easy and it costs 2 per bag if you want to check your bags in and walk around before leaving the city we had three bags and they charged 3 to drop off and 3 upon retrieval the room was very cozy small and the heating was not the best the shower was dated but forceful and pleasantly hot we;4
the hyatt at lax is a comfortable hotel staffed with a knowledgable friendly staff who clearly make customer service a priority my only issue this that the walls seem very thin as i could hear my neighbors tv all evening and their talking i had a very early flight back to the east coast and was unable to get a restful sleep because of the sound;4
excellent location services and restaurant for visiting the area especially universal studios shuttle parking hotel and services were great i have stayed here before for business and will again anytime i am in the area;4
this hotel was convenient to hollywood attractions griffith park its across the street from the red line subway station lots of good retaurants a few blocks away on hillhurst and vermont easy secure parking yes you do pay 18 but theres someone at the gate at all hours ive stayed several times and the rooms are nice some much larger than others tv was a bit fuzzy the last time i stayed but not a big issue since we were out and about most of the time room was always clean and the staff was helpful and polite free continental breakfast was definitely a plusincluded eggs sausage croissants in addition to the traditional continental breakfast spread;4
upon checkin i was informed there was no room for me candidly i did not properly check my confirmation or i would have noticed it was a day off in any event the honors checkin staffer was less than helpful normally as a longtime gold member you would expect action please find a room for me here or at the very least call the sheraton next door and help me find a room there this did not happen nothing happened after finally securing a room it became very clear that my issue was isolated to this individual the room was great and the remaining staff were fantastic in every way i have stayed here several times over the years and the rooms are great big room big bathroom and a well appointed and clean environment the lobby is nice and for me the location;4
when we arrived the check in desk was very busy waited around an hour i got a free bottle of wine for celebrating my 21st checked into our room i was so upset it was so small couldnât fit two suitcases on the floor at once it was freezing i thought itâs only for sleeping in were in new york we wonât spend much time gets to the morning and the water from the bath and shower was green went down to the front desk asking to change rooms and iâm so glad we did we paid a little extra upgrade fee room 3907 was absolutely incredible and the view was something else 100 made my holiday so much better the tick tock diner next door is fabulous amazing staff food is incredible already booking for next year with this hotel and we will 100 pay for this exact room;4
as afamily of 4 we booked the new yorker for 7 nights on arrival we found the room to be very cramped but accepted this as new york city standards we booked via expedia they asked for a review and my husband submitted that the staff were fantastic hotel public areas amazing but the room was very small for a family of 4 for 7 nights next thing we knew the manager kader was looking for us she upgraded us to a suite with late check out on our last day free of charge amazingly well handled and most unexpected kader had awarm friendly sunny personality and made our holiday experience more special;4
i appreciated the housekeeping staff who did a good job of cleaning the room and the people who make sure only hotel residents come in the elevators the business room was just what i needed and the gym was great the rooms are small but it seems thats what one should expect in downtown the rooms do not have a fridge or microwave both of which would have been very nice at checkin i was charged an additional 40 resort fee ontop of the resort fee charged when i reserved the room parking is 50 a night theres a spot for 23cars to pullover and unload before parking kittycorner to the hotel there are lots of places to eat within walking distance and its not a difficult walk to times square the empire state building or the 911 site possible changes fans in;4
this hotel was renovated a couple year back nice rooms and bathrooms self parking is separate in the garage next door from another company that you pay from ticket machines the hotel has valet but was pricey at 44 self parking was 19 overall rooms are nice i would stay here again the club lounge access is on the 3rd floor with lots of room and food was good definitely worth it the only downside is beverage coolers are closed at 10 pm wish they kept the coolers open so guests could grab water;4
this was my second stay at the days inn broadway the upper west side of manhattan is a real living working neighborhood far from the tourist trap that is times square great mom and pop restaurants and diners within blocks of the hotel the subway entrance is literally a 100 yards out the front door yes the hotel is old and has a patina on it i dont expect pampering and luxury for the price but the hotel has what i require in spades its clean pleasant staff if you take the time to actually talk to them wifi and ac worked great in my room and i even got a nice street view this time this is such a great base of operations for a ny trip there is no reason to stay in midtown like most tourists think they need to i come to ny frequently and this hotel will always be;4
air conditioning left much to be desired large roach in the bathroom decor is a bit odd a bit art decoarvant guarde nice staff comfort was fairly good good location a bit pricey for what i recieved but id certainly consider staying again;4
we have just returned from five days stay at this hotel which we found to be wonderful we were able to get around really well and see all the major sights from this hotel via the excellent metro system which is just a block away the hotel is very clean and rooms spacious with a fridge microwave iron and ironing board the reception staff were excellent and very helpful giving us a lot of useful information the breakfast is particularly good especially the waffles it really set us up for the busy day ahead the only down side is that if you want night life or restaurants there is nothing nearby although it didnt bother us as we stayed out most of the day and were just ready for fast food take out and our beds;4
what a lovely place staff were helpful and welcoming and the cabin type room was functionally perfect a real feel of sleeping in a cabin and a whilst i feared that the shared bathrooms would not be numerous enough for the number of rooms this was unfounded and there were no issues clean pleasant and would definitely stay again the rooftop bar is lovely and the view from there is fantastic i would recommend to anyone as this was a great experience in a wonderful location;4
a great hotel located in central manhattan central park is close by which was a huge plus for our morningwalks good service and nice rooms amazing rooftopbar with a nice view perfect for warm new york nights;4
this is our second stay at the hilton universal and we were not disappointed great staff great location free shuttle to universal studios and citywalk though we usually walked because its only 510min they are renovating right now so the lobby isnt as nice as it usually is but the restaurants and pool are all still functioning so the reno isnt a big deal room service is consistently good food and promptly delivered though pricey very expensive parking and wifi charges in my opinion the room rate is pretty reasonable for la but these added charges add up room was clean and comfroatble and large enough for the four of us would still stay here again its the best choice for universal studios;4
i recently stayed 3 nights at this hotel and found the location to be fantastic i took an upgrade for 15 per night to obtain a room on a higher floor and boy was it worth it as when i looked out my window the empire state building was right in front of me the room was larger than i expected especially for new york of which i have stayed many times it had everything i needed a really good hair dryeriron ironing board and great wifi a must for me when travelling on business the staff at this hotel were lovely and i liked that when you were coming back into the hotel each person heading towards the lift were asked to show their room key so for me good way to ensure only guests staying at the hotel were allowed up to the floors and when travelling alone is;4
i stayed at the jane during a recent visit to the big apple i was there for 6 nights the dã©cor of the hotel is quite stunning itâs like going back in time very âgrand budapest hotelâ âesque i really enjoyed my stay i found the staff helpful and informative the location is brilliant right in the centre of the meat packing district the rooms are incredibly small even for new yorkâs standard iâve been to japan and i thought the rooms were small there but the jane winâs that award i would definitely stay again i think next time iâll opt for a room with a private bathroom i had no issues with the shared bathroom and toilet it was always clean it just became a bit of a chore after a while walking both and forth down the hall to shower or use the loo if you want;4
we stayed here for 5 nights and cant really fault it the hotel was lovely and the staff were all very friendly helpful the rooms are compact but have everything you need theres a dinner for breakfast although wed recommend heading out and about the restaurant is really nice well worth a visit location wise you could be much more central and with penn station right next doors its so easy to get everywhere make sure take some comfy shoes;4
this was a great choice of hotel for my first time in nyc i went with my mom and we left happy the location is perfect its nice that its not right in the middle of times square since i was always able to get a good sleep because it wasnt noisy the hotel is nice and has character to it every staff member we came across was helpful and super friendly we took an uber from newark to the hotel and a shuttle was arranged to drop us back off at the end of the trip so that was easy enough i recommend staying here if you want to be around all of the action easy subway access to other parts such as brooklyn but still be able to get a good sleep the only negative thing i experienced was there was never hot water when i had a shower in the morning i can imagine its because;4
we have just recently had three nights here and found the location to be fabulous just a short block walk to central park right on lincoln square a very easy walk down into manhattens famous time square the carnegie deli etcetera the rooms are small but very clean and have everything you need except the ability to make yourself a cup of tea or coffe n your room but lots of american hotels do not offer this anyway i had read many reviews saying that the rooms were very noisy we had an maternal room that looked into an internal open well and we found our room to be very quiet and dark at night which ensured a great nights sleep every night the internet is free if u are n the lobby area which is an open two storey space so that you can sit on very comfy lounges upstairs;4
stayed here for four nights with my family my brother and my dad had a room and me and my mum shared the other before we went we emailed the hotel regarding the scaffolding all around the outside of the hotel they said it wouldnât be a problem it would be gone and as we were going to celebrate my dadâs 60th they would upgrade the rooms for us when we got there was no note on the system to say we should be upgraded but the receptionist managed to find us two rooms that she could upgrade us too we got two massive apartments but there was scaffolding when we looked out of our window which made the room all dark we phoned downstairs and explained and the lady called back after 10 mins to say give her another ten mins she would sort it for us we wanted to all be on the;4
visited with a friend for my birthday they upgraded our room and we had the most amazing view fresh bedding and towels daily the room was spotless the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were to die for could not fault it the only downside was we werent told there was a daily fee until we checked out and when i asked what this was for they said use of wifi and telephone calls so dont fall for the free wifi because its obviously not free we had to pay nearly 100 this was extortionate as we were only in out room to sleep didnt get a chance to use the so called free wifi if we had been told when we checked in we would have been prepared lesson learnt;4
this was my first hotel i ever stayed in on my first trip to new york being much younger at the time i remember the staff treating my boyfriend and i no different than any other guests of the hotel everyone was so kind accommodating and our rooms were even upgraded to a corner suite i distinctly remember 10th floor king corner i woke up to the most beautiful view of lincoln center covered in a fresh douse of snow the beds were comfortable the room was relatively large and the fresh apples every morning were wonderful ultimately ive taken many trips to new york since and have not had the pleasure to stay here again but the next time i must definitely do so the rooftop bar was something i was not able to try before so i look forward to it next time;4
when staying in new york city location can be allimportant you do not want to waste even one minute getting to your favorite places problem is a good location invariably means a steep price and nyc is a very expensive place to stay at least by usa standards through shrewd blind bidding i was able to get a weekend at this place for less than 200 a night our room 711 had two double beds shower no tub iron table inroom safe radio alarm ac and hd tv with 59 channels the room was clean fairly quiet and wellmaintained it was also small as was the bathroom closet work desk and drawers there were charges for the phone even tollfree numbers coffee maker and any item in the refrigerator im not certain if wifi was free or if i got lucky when;4
ok so review is a bit late as computer has been broken this hotel is a great little gem great price and fabulous location on arrival we were upgraded to a room with two double beds on the corner of the 12th floor room 1201 for new york so ive been told the room was huge beds were comfy and shower was amazing the location is literally a walk from times square and in the other direction central park jeff on the door was really friendly and informative as was elena on the reception there was a little confusion on checking in as they wanted a deposit of 100 for extras which we didnt know about from our travel agent so maybe making it known would save others a lot of embarrassment habvier spelling on the bar the first two nights was lovely he came out to;4
before going i checked all the reviews here i believe being nice is the quickest way to ensure good service and was not disappointed we were there for 9 days and got a really big room the microwave and fridge were perfect for us since we were traveling with our toddler the beds were big and just right the breakfast offered is substantial and good and the recently redone pool is quite pretty the only issue we had was with the soap dispenser in the laundry room we got our money back but they should be replaced if they dont work;4
we stayed at the universal hilton during my daughters gymnastics compition this was our third stay at this hotel the service was much better this time and i am glad we chose this hotel the proximity to universal studios makes this the best hotel for us;4
great overnight layover arrived from london and swim in heated outdoor pool was nice end to long day nice rooms gracious staff excellent location 2 reasons for 4 instead of 5 star huge outdoor pool but no hot tub ca nonsmokers rights were ignored defacto smoking section right outside the door to the pool area very disappointed that a hotel of this quality with visible security staff clearly chooses to ignore the smokers who make it unpleasant for the majority of the guests who simply want to walk to pool without being assaulted by second hand smoke;4
the empire is across the street from the met where we went to the baron fund conference on the 25th the hotel room was small but the convenience was great because it was so close the staff were exceptional from the time we checked in with emir who was very helpful polite and patient to the rooftop bar staff who were exceptionally in their service canât leave out ray whose friendliness and sense of humor made us all laugh;4
stayed during a busy summer heatwave room was cool and clean beds and pillows very comfortable shame that a 3 bed configuration not available for 3 friends travelling together trundle bed was quoted at 29 per night which seemed excessive and dont think it could fit in the room anyway other downsides were no refrigerator or tea making facilities which for a 10 night stay would have been a convenient and helpful addition great location right in the thick of it and wonderful city views from the 32nd floor love the hotels history and elegance and overall we enjoyed our stay;4
this hotel has an excellent location to visit all major attractions in manhattan on foot there is a train and subway service next to it and it is the most convenient spot to do a lot of sightseeing i would have preferred a room with a view but we were allocated an inside room looking onto machinery the checkin is very slow so would recommend to allow plenty of time for it;4
it is definately worth staying here only improvement that could be taken is toilets cleanliness that was the worst point of my stay i would recommend it and i stopped there 3rd time myself if there is any change to reservation happened twice already then they offer satysfying solution thank you and see you again;4
great value for money stayed in a double twin private room and felt very safe even when on my own for a few nights great location 2 min walk to the tube station and was very handy for luggage lots of food places near and many options in the tube station also for groceries and lunchdinner would definitely recommend only hard thing was carrying luggage up the stairs;4
my daughter and i stayed here for 8 days over xmas and we loved it ill start with the staff who will go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible cris on concierge was the best though he helped me with bookings for various things like ice skating prior to travelling to nyc even calling me 4 times in one day to make a booking for me we stayed on the 9th floor and never had any disruption from upstairs bar rooms are a little small but from reading reviews on here i got way more than i expected happily the beds were comfy and linen fresh and clean daily the bathroom in our room was a bit on the tiny side though with a great shower now the lifts no wait times at all apart from one day when one lift was broken and then it was only a couple of;4
when i desire to get away from the norm of my daily standard living and want to burlesquely masquerade a get away and treat myself to some outside lodging arrangement i often choose the hollywood hotel simply put it is nearby clean friendly still local and reasonably inexpensive i have been a customer of this hotel for several years now and i almost always recommend it to friends whom dont wish to embarge on me and who wish to be in a centralized area of los angeles as briefly mentioned the hotel is local its clean and the staff is friendly if you are looking for a place where the areaneighborhood is superb then this isnt the place but if you are looking for a place such as a hidden little oasis in the rough then this is it i am always often;4
i went to universal studios for the first time in many years and wanted a great experience so i booked the closest hotel for the day before and night after the hilton is basically on the lot with the sheraton universal right next door both are roughly a 7 minute walk but the hilton was cheaper arriving is a bit complicated with various freeway offramps and streets and signs guiding you where to go i made some mistakes and had to backtrack but eventually found my my way to their selfparking 17 a day after parking its a bit of a journey to wander through the complexity of the hotel to get to the front desk to checkin i suppose if one went to the main entrance and was valet shuttled it would be easy but also cost more checkin went smoothly and i was upgraded to a;4
stayed here for a few nights with the family on a recent trip the hotel is recently renovated and modern the tv setup is fantastic and wifi is great had an enjoyable stay at this hotel and would recommend it;4
check in for the three night stay was easy and steve at the check in desk managed to find an early check in for the busy christmas weekend valet service room service and restaurant staff were good the hotel has shuttle service the restaurant has a friday saturday sunday buffet that is very good and attracts many regulars and locals we also enjoyed the live music during the buffets the only negative was the 24 daily charge for parking and 28 fee for valet parking couldnt comment on the room views because ours was facing the freeway;4
great location clean secure friendly must recommend walking distance from penn station walking distance most of attraction staff was friendly missed teacoffe maker in the room must provide room service as well;4
this hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly they store your luggage beforeafter checkout so you dont have to lug it around the city right across from lincoln center and a block from central park i would stay here again without hesitation;4
great location tiny rooms as expected in nyc we were on the 20th floor and were upgraded for my boyfriends birthday to a view of the empire state from our room very noisy from noise outside and rooms are so close could her next doors conversation lovely surprise for his birthday from the hotel bottle of prosecco and chocolates and a card we arrived at 630 in morning and couldnât check in until 4 but paid 50 dollars to check in and they found us our upgraded room straight away only thing which really annoyed me hence 1 star less is we checked out at 12 our flight not until 730 in the evening and they charge you for storing your luggage 5 dollars per item some may think nothing of that but when youâve just stayed with them for 6 nights i think thatâs a joke;4
the people here are great really helpful the location is within walking distance of universal cityâs front gate and city walk the hotel is nice and clean the corner room we had with a king was spacious when we had trouble getting hot water in the shower the staff took care of it right away and discounted our stay iâd definitely stay again;4
for the price the cleanliness and the location this is 5 star all round for a hostel previous reviews were quite negative about staff etc we had no problems was a bit odd that some toilets and showers were unisex but there were loads and other floors did have separate femalemale toilets was impressed with how clean the place was beds were comfy and bedding was all white the frames of the beds a bit rocky we had booked a twin but were given a quad but assured it would just be me and my partner in it which it was you are round the corner from hammersmith tube stations and you are on the piccadilly line for those travelling from heathrow so getting in and out was fuss free also you have access to 4 different tube lines and loads of buses start or finish in hammersmith;4
lovely stay enjoyed the hotel staff were friendly and the location was excellent easy walk to central park and the subway for downtown the room was clean and had a great view of lincoln center would definitely book again;4
this was a difficult review to write because the 1st person a met was one of the valet parking staff i hadnât blocked anything we were popping in to get our room then self park she demanded my car keys which were even as i explained it was just a pop in check in was friendly nothing special internet policy not explained we went self parked expensive tried to get the free shuttle to city walk infrequent asked door staff for directions and were vaguely pointed in the direction of city walk the room was great well appointed although tv fridge coffee machine were not working we called reception technician came fiddled with the plug told us that housekeeping always knock these out for me this really is not the hilton way why not check everything works before;4
this a solid 3 star hotel clean good sized rooms with a nice bed and a good variety of pillows nice large bathroom free wifi that works ok not great nice lcd tv fridge and microwave in room all in all a good value for the price under 100 the quibbles chilly front desk woman greeted me upon arrival and never once cracked a smile the hotel is located in a soso section of n vermont try and get a rear room since vermont is noisy so you pay 18day for secure parking its nice to also have a complimentary breakfast buffet served in a full sized dining room however the eggs are nasty they look like yellow coasters but cereal juice and coffee hit the spot also theres no inroom safe a standard item in most 3 hotels i ultimately got a better price;4
great location 54th and broadway next door to colbert theater within easy walking distance of times square rooms small but nice service was nice and helpful optional breakfast not worth the price;4
we had stayed here two years ago and returned because of its proximity to the gibson amphitheatre we had tickets to the teen choice awards they have recently added a small takeaway coffee shop breakfast pastries coffee fruit icecream that is a great addition to the hotel we found the hotel to be in an excellent position whether driving literally two minutes off the freeway or using the subway which is at the bottom of the hill to get around rooms are large we overlooked the studios and over to burbank with the mountains in the distance the views with all the lights on at night and then the sun coming up in the morning were fantastic beds were very comfy with nice linens plenty of towels in the;4

i was looking for a place close to the train station to avoid finding a taxi at rush hour this is the place there are over 1000 rooms in many combinations i booked a suite so the teenagers could have their own room the couch was surprisingly good to sleep on many elevators so we never had to wait the front desk was friendly and efficient the views from our 26th floor room were an added bonus as was the balcony there is the tic tock dinner in the hotel and we ate their for our breakfast each day would stay again;4
recently stayed here on a five night trip with my husband as a birthday treat thanks to jose for upgrading us to a suite with amazing views great location for exploring nyc and thatâs exactly what we done i would recommend this hotel as nothing was too much bother;4
on our first morning we went to tick tock which is a 24 hour diner monday morning around 10am it was so busy food delicious and staff work very hard service they come to you to take order after food they give you the bill then either pay at counter or pay your waiter with tip of course butcher and banker is downstairs and a very classy cocktail bar and small restaurant â£30 for 2 cocktails but a very unique location being an old bank vault until the 1980s;4
stayed here for 4 nights and it suited our needs perfectlyit was basic but clean the staff were all friendlynice neighborhood and close to the subwayrooms and bedding clean with beds made everday and clean towelsshared bathroom but we seemed to have it to ourselves and there was always hot water;4
we wanted a night away and stayed in one of the junior suites the staff was very friendly and helpful the location is away from busy part of the city but it is still filled with action packed things to do and places to go the bathroom was a little small but our room was a good size for the price we paid we were very happy with our stay and we look forward to going back when itâs warmer and we are able to use the rooftop;4
after reading a few mixed reviewswe were a little apprehensivebut i must say we had a superb stay at the empire rooms are nice and cleanall the staff are very good from front desk to rooftop to maidsthe rooftop bar is excellent and the staff and djs are very friendly and are up for a good time and funi would have no hesitation about staying at the empire again next time we are in new yorkalso within a few minutes walk are some superb bars and restaurants;4
we had a lovely stay at the riad over new years eve the owner and staff made every effort to ensure our visit to marrakech was a pleasurable one they even found a guide and organized our a tour of southern of morocco spending time on the phone to reserve and bargain for a good rate at several hotels breakfast was plentiful oranges were everywhere for the taking delicious they gave us a mobile phone for the length of our stay at the riad just in case we got lost in a souk i suspect another reason is because the riad is in a residential neighbourhood not frequented by tourists it had only been a few months since they had opened the riad so the moroccan and italian staff was slightly more anxious about everything being just right than it would normally be im sure in a;4
free shuttle from and to the airport that is 700 m away bar and food service for the very tired and or no fuss clients however if you wanted to have a nice meal while relaxing in a soft tone environment and confortable seatsthat is not the place we took a standard room which category is â«â never available before the regular checkin time at 1500 hrsâ â» unless you pay for it too bad so for a quick in and outnor if you are ready to pay for uber or taxi for better environment while eating itâs perfect;4
we my wife and i enjoy very much our stay in the empire hotel due to the exceptional location of the hotel a few meters between the columbus and broadway one block from the central park and practically on the other side of the avenue from the lincoln center the room had the necessary space and it was very clean the front desk gave us the very expected early check in considering our 12 hours flight to get in new york the only;4
the location is fantastic right next the subway station for links all across manhattan madison square garden is pretty much next door and it is only a short walk from the empire state building macyâs and times square there are loads of great pubs and restaurants 12 blocks away but if you decide to eat at the hotel the trattoria bianca has decent food and a relaxing bar butcher and banker restaurant also on site was very quirky in a bank vault under the hotel but very expensive in my opinion as a lone traveller i found the room size a standard queen to be absolutely fine for my needs however it would feel quite small for 2 people so be wary of this when booking the beds are not queen size they are doubles the bathroom is very small and the tv can be;4
this is the second time we stayed at the empire the location was perfect for my husbands conference the staff was friendly and helpful rooms are small but comfy who stays in their room in nyc anyway easy walk to shopping lots of restaurants and central park;4
it was a good stay nothing else to say only way to be better is to have lower rates i did not partake in the breakfast;4
you wont find a closer hotel to lax airport the shuttle ride is about 5 minutes away and it is even possible to walk to the hotel from the airport the rooms feature a double window so aircraft takeoffs and landings did not disturb me i found the rooms to be impeccably clean and modern in typical hyatt fashion there were plenty of electric plugs and usb charging locations in the room the hotel public areas are very colorful with the rooms being a trendy gray and yellow see photos i always prefer a lone shower unit vs a tubshower combo and this hotel had that desired feature my room really didnt have a desk but a round table featuring a lamp with an electrical outlet i liked the sofa sitting area for relaxing windows are smaller but there was a;4
a nice hotel great location within walking distance of everything you need to see in new york and amazing diner adjoined on the ground floor under going a refurb at the moment but not a huge impact basic room is quite small but as long as youâre here to sleep and not ball room dance itâs fine;4
me and my son have just returned from a 4 night stay we were given a room on the 33rd floor with a great view of madison square gardens check in was smooth we loved the room yes the bathroom is dated but itâs a 1920s hotel and we liked the fact it still had period features tick tock diner was great ate there for dinner and twice for breakfast location wise this hotel is perfect not far from any of the attractions the only negative was the elevators took upwards of 15 minutes in the morning would be full of people and stopping on every floor it was a nightmare i would definitely come back in the future provided the elevators were fixed thankyou for an amazing stay ð;4
we stayed at the ameritania for 1 week at the end of september we choose the hotel for the location good reviews and price when booking we upgraded to a deluxe room for only a few extra pounds a night we felt it was worth it for a much larger room as we were staying for a week the room was spacious lovely large high pressure shower comfortable king size bed although a little soft for my liking we used the wifi in the lobby several times before we headed out for the day or after returning had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which were reasonably priced for ny ice cold water was available 24 hours a day and tea coffee in the morning the location of the hotel was great just a few minutes walk from times square and central park and very close to a subway there;4
the hotel is great my room was spacious with a comfy bed and huge bathroom the staff members are very helpful and accommodating the one downside to this property is the prices they charge at their restaurants i ate lunch in the lobby bar and a mediocre club sandwich with cold french fries and a cocacola tip cost me 31 i passed on the dinner buffet when i found out that it was 54 per person;4
stayed at the hotel for 4 nights with 5 friends we had a suite on one of the higher floors which was a great size and perfect for our needs we also had a huge terrace which although we couldnt really enjoy as it was chilly it was a lovely surprise with great views the staff were friendly and the guys that worked overnight checking access to the lifts made us feel really safe particularly with one of them kindly dealing with some unwanted attention towards on of my friends great location with lots in walking distance also enjoyed the tick tock diner which was attached to the hotel small downside is the size of the beds very comfortable but also very small;4
new york astor on the park good location good room good price date of stay 1819 dec 2008 reviwer wandering wondererhk room was small but very clean you will love the toilet and bath tub as it appears to be newly rennovated or well kept we were put in a room with a kingsized bed facing central park i would agree with the other reviews that there is not much room to put big bags but we just had backpacks so it was no problem for us staff were very helpful in giving tips and directions on how to go around and where to get some eats locationwise it is just three blocks from the 103rd street subway station the m10 bus is also just on the next street i took the airtrainsubway from the airport and did ot find any trouble finding the place it is located in a;4
nyc was the third stop on our two week trip we wanted a good value in manhattan that can be hard to find this place fit the bill small rooms but all we needed was a place to lay out head at the end of the day we werent looking for a luxurious hotel polite staff helpful with getting a ride to the airport rooms were clean sheets were soft and the all tile bathroom with nice shampoo and lotion was a bonus no free wifi but the little deli up the block was a go to for that;4
ill warn you the moment you enter the room actually the cabin it will look incredibly small to you it is but i have been to other hotels in that part of manhattan and theyre not bigger if you want to pay that price i mean at least this hotel looks really nice from the decor to the staff uniforms everything has that 19201930s look and the bathroom though shared is really clean it is also conveniently placed quite near to a subway stop and with their own restaurantcafã©;4
we went to universal studios and wanted a hotel close by so we didnt have to drive choice was hilton and sheraton chose the hilton because we got a good aaa rate the room was clean quiet with good view from 18th floor the hotel has a cafe and coffee shop on lobby floor both were good for breakfast with good foodservice we ate by the pool on one of the days bus stops every 15 minutes to take tofrom universal studios it was very convenient had a good time with lots of places to eatshop at city walk only complaint is they left only half the towel allotment on the second day otherwise would give an excellent rating;4
tiny noisy rooms and shared bathrooms but still worth it for the west village location and the very very relative value but especially for the fantastic cafe and its brunches style overcomes all else;4
as i arrived at the entrance of the morningside inn i thought this looks very basic but clean and welcoming there is a kitchen on every floor however the noise from the kitchen woke me up a few times shower worked well flat screen hd tv fridge was useful bed was very comfortable really nice area subway is 710 mins walk staff were friendly and allowed me to shower after i did the new york marathon even though i had checked out they also recommended a diner the manchester diner a couple of blocks away the food was great staff great would recommend it overall the room was basic clean good location great base to crash at if i ever go back to new york i would use this hotel again;4
we stayed in a very nice room renovated no view really from room but appreciated the coffee and waters supplied daily restaurant in the hotel was tasty as well we would definitely stay here again if we visit;4
getting a nonrefundable early reservation saved us some money and we got very good value in return hotel is very convenient to all the sites and venues in nyc just off broadway and close to the uptowndowntown 7th avenue route rooms were very quiet and clean our only complaint during our stay is that the blanket though clean was old and had several holes in it that takes the romance out of it if you spot those check in and out was easy free newspaper daily and coffeesnack in room many restaurants close by desk staff was superbly helpful in our planning and very courteous a nice stay and well go back again;4
we stayed here for over a week during our trip to new york last year the best thing about the hotel is the location we were in room number 2222 and had a view of the empire state building and madison square garden we loved the overall service and hospitality and enjoyed some nice treats at tick todk diner too hoping to visit again very soon for more food and travel updates follow our page on instagram â bhavna and shahaan thank you;4
the area the hotel is at is not the best but u get use to that real quick because the hollywood hotel is a great hotel and easy to get anywhere from there using the metro which is just a 5 min walk we have a 3 year daughter and we thought it was fine and safe for her so would def return again we loved waba grill which is just a min walk from the hotel great healthy place to eat and delucious which a gentleman working at the hotel suggest we go and was great we loved the complimentary breakfast that was available till 1030 was really great food and service i will recommend this hotel to any of my friends traveling to la very pleased with our stay next time will stay longer;4
we stayed here the last night of a ca trip with the intention of going to universal studios for the day and heading out early the next morning to burbank airport the hotel lobby is attractive and the selfparking underground could not have been more convenient the room we booked was great and had a wonderful view of course the room was rather pricey also we were able to checkin midmorning as our room was ready which was great our plan was to go to universal for the day explore city walk afterwards as well as having dinner and return to the hotel on the last scheduled shuttle at 8 pm we were however told by the front desk staff that since the hotel had few guests the shuttles last run back to the hotel would be at 430pm and we were told by the shuttle;4
we stayed here the last two times we flew out of lax once staying here upon a late arrival and the other the night before to catch an early flight both times we parked in the parking garage next door quikpark lax for which i made separate reservations the shuttle runs regularly and worked great im glad to see this hotel so close to lax has been attractively renovated to accommodate modern travelers beds were comfortable noise was nonexistent and there are plugs and usb ports for many devices bathroom has a nice shower good counter space and makeup mirror once we ate breakfast in the restaurant downstairs not cheap but nicely presented with interesting tasty choices and good service this hotel offers amenities we didnt use but i recommend this for a comfortable;4
emergency trip to washington dc from nyc this hotel provided no drinks available or snacks upon arrival electrician guy provided door bell door knock flasher for my hotel room was good television was without closed captions;4
we stayed for 7 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience nice location close to the park and very nice interior incredibly trendy and although the rooms are fairly small they are well laid out and comfortable we visited the bar which did great cocktails id say the only downside was the staff were not quite as friendly and welcoming as id expect from a 4 manhattan hotel they were a little vague and reserved its also worth noting its location on the west side is not too near many touristy attractions this didnt bother us as we quite like being away from the hustle and bustle but it worth noting if you are planning to stay;4
i enjoyed this hotel we had bunk beds it was clean and friendly and the ac worked we shared a bathroom at the end of the hall for 125 per room it was well worth it we were here for a party came in late and left early the only issue for a non smoking hotel is that they have tenants who are grandfathered and cant be forced to not smoke or leave while i did not smell anything in the room the hallway was ripe i think it is only the third floor parking is immediately across the street in a garage that isnt connected with the hotel i would stay again;4
itâ´s a nice hotel just opposite of the lincoln center metropolitan opera concert hall best place for all who attend the opera in the evening not being an inhabitant of nyc bedroom was really ok the bathroom somewhat too small all in all we appreciated the stay in the hotel and recommend it;4
well i have just returned from a whistle stop tour of new york using this hotel as a based or the trip after being recommended it by a family friend if you like hotels that still have the same character as when it was opened then this is a great hotel the lobby hasnt changed that much it seems looking at the photos of the hotel downstairs by the restrooms in the hotel the room sizes are a little on the small side but they are functional and clean and comfortable and lets face it if you are visiting ny like i was on a site seeing tour we were out the rooms but 8am and didnt return till 9pm at night its just a place to rest up and recharge to do it all again the next day one thing make sure you ask for a coffee machine it does tea as well as long as you dont;4
the empire is a very good hotel just across the street from lincoln center the chowder house restaurant has an excellent but pricey ie 32 breakfast buffet the hotel is expensive but definitely worth it for the convenience if you are attending an event at lincoln center and for a bit of luxury just wish that that they would have free wifi in the rooms;4
i traveled with 3 colleagues whose rooms were very smallbut i was given an upgrade to a larger room so i was quite pleased in room purchases are expensive but heyits ny lincoln center is right across the avenue;4
a very good hotel de hotel is on the corner of 94th street and broadway and is just 2 streets away from the subway station 96th street line 2 brings you to times square whitin 15 minutes the room has a kingsize bed and the shower has different massage positions what is nice but can make your bathroom a bit wet on complaint about galahotels i wanted to shorten my stay with 2 days but as it was paid in advance i had to contact galahotels unfortunately email cant be delivered and the phone is unreachable or picked up;4
firstly this is not a cheap hotel its one of the most famous in new york so of course it isnt but it is a very good hotel once we had moved rooms the first one was the size of a stamp and had the view from a mail box my mum and i had a spacious room with two big beds large bathroom very powerful shower and a nice view looking west the new yorker is in a good location for most of manhattan check in was easy although check out was done by an extremely miserable lady the small museum downstairs is worth seeing for a few minutes and the building itself is a beautiful art deco construction downsides a few the wardrobe closest in our room 3039 didnt have a light in it which is moronic and the bathroom door handle on the inside has to be pushed about 150 degrees;4
great location and poshlike atmosphere of the hotel lobby and room room is tight but if you have ever traveled to europe not that much of an issue rudy at the front desk was extremely friendly and professional made the experience of my stay so much better felt the hotel tried to nickel and dime me the entire timeâ¦made me think this hotel is cheap i mean really nearly 5 to use their kuereg coffee and tea should be included as part of the stay i have read complaints about walls being thin and hearing everythingâ¦i did not notice noise traffic other than hearing running water from the neighbor the building is an older building so what do you expect yes the rooms are tight but you should be spending more time exploring the city and less time in the room anyways;4
this hotel is in a great location if you want to visit nyc close to the subway stations and a direct line straight from jfk airport its on the edge of china town and lower east side so be prepared for an area which is not super clean but at the same time full of life china town in nyc is the largest outide of china so you can almost get two holiday experiences in one we got a warm welcome in the hotel and the room was clean except for a few black marks in the seal around the bath the bed was large and very comfortable and there was a new flat screen tv in the room as well as a digital locking safe for valuablesyou also get a private bathroom which is not the case in all of the cheaper hotels in manhattenwe were on the 6th floor and could see the empire state;4
if youre going to universal studios you cant pick a better located hotel you can walk to the park or take the convienently offered shuttle the staff was helpful and the hotel was clean the best feature of the hotel is the location;4
weve been coming here for about 2 years now when we have a show at the pantages theatre approximately 8 times per year on a thursday just 15 minutes away to the pantages here right now great location great views but slow elevators though it has gotten better parking is expensive 28 self park and 40 valet folks in the resturant know us and they treat us like family but thats everyone i have seen while dining even though sometime well take the shuttle to city walk for dinner back here end of july and recommend busy right because president of taiwan his here;4
great location for visiting universal studios and hollywood self parking was easy check in a breeze my room was ready on arrival and thatâs always a nice surprise we were on the 11th floor facing the park if youâd like a good view of the park iâd say try to get a room on the 15th floor or higher we couldnât see much but it wasnât a deal breaker for us the walk to from the park was easy maybe 10 mins max if the rooms had better in room coffee iâd give it 5 stars iâll definitely stay here again when visiting the area;4
staff was quite rude except arthur and it was blatantly obvious in the different treatment of wealthy people compared to normal people please see prior section that goes into more detail and better explanation on the experience received from the staff;4
this hotel when its on special offer is hard to beat this is my second time staying here overall the service is great its family run so the staff are very attentive and efficient good sized rooms always kept well daily room cleaning and hugos freshly made omelettes are fantastic and as i stay for a week he knows exactly how to make them only down side is when i have a car i dont stay here as its 25 dollars a night for the car and guest parking is charged for also the bar is limited sunday it closed at 7pm overall its good value for money with great staff a home away from home;4
i chose this hotel as i had read the reviews and it sounded like just what we would likei was not wrong the location was perfect as it was close to times square with lots of good places to eat close by the staff were very friendly and helpful rooms a good size and spotlessly clean the room was quiet and beds really comfy i could not fault it at all they offer breakfast which we didnt have but it always looked busy and not badly priced either for ny i would definitely return to this hotel again;4
this is not the place for you if you are planning on spending time in your hotel room but it is a great location close to trendy restaurants with a club downstairs and the price was fairly good this hotel is more similar to a hostel you would find in europe than a typical north american hotel;4
fresh omelets and waffles fruit cheese plate pastries cereal toast and friendly staff a great way to start your day our balcony wasnt much but there was a lovely courtyard lounge chairs by the pool and comfortable chairs on the outdoor common balcony at the end of our 2nd floor hotel room the rooms were clean and the beds comfortable another great thing to note is that the hotel is located very close to the red line metro which made getting around without a car a better experience than i expected that one line took us to hollywood universal studios and downtown as well simple bus routes took us to paramount studio beverly hill the original farmers market and the cbs studio;4
ok if you look for an apartment to explore upper east side then woogo is greatthere are major musings is this project dont expect luxury staff but expect a filling like ordinary apartment time to relax east sleep have a good hot bath and then get out to explore;4
the hotel is in a really good area and with amazing price the room is small but very comfortable the shower is amazing despite the area the hotel is very quite what is essential to sleep after long walks in ny the hotel is few minutes from central park and a small walk to times square;4
stayed here for 3 nights for my daughterâs theater showcase location was perfect decor very modern and every area clean beds comfy and only sounds we heard we other doors closing and opening in the morning staff was helpful in all regards even assisting with transport to airport only downfall was our room size having stayed in new york before we were a bit surprised i would not recommend more than 2 people in standard room however if needed would stay here again;4
we thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel and would stay here again it was in a great location in walking distance to time square the diner next door was great our room was clean and had a great view we stayed in a suite which very comfortably fit the 4 of us the staff was attentive and very nice they made our stay comfortable and provided us with attraction suggestions in the city i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting nyc;4
let me start off by saying that this hotel is really a terrific place â especially for the money but if you are staying over a thursday friday or saturday night be very careful unbeknownst to me or iâd never have booked this place they run a night club downstairs on those nights if you have a room that overlooks jane street good luck sleeping even with high quality earplugs the vibrations will keep you awakeâ¦until 4am i did complain and got moved to another room the next night with a small refund of 15 on one night for the inconvenience i was very close to moving out entirely but they found me a better room and things worked out ok speaking of the rooms i doubt iâd return if i didnât get a captainâs room they are quite spacious and very comfortable the;4
i have stayed in this hotel more times than i can count because i love the ballet and it is hands down the best place to stay if you are going to something at lincoln center because you can just walk across the street the rooms can be a bit dark and they vary quite a bit in comfort depending on whether you are in an outside or an inside room try to avoid the inside rooms some rooms come with robes but this is very hit or miss i wish they would make this standard because a robe and inroom coffee are my two musts they didnt use to have the inroom coffee but now they do yeah it is not free but it still beats having to get dressed and go our for it the design of the showers and counter space is not ideal water sprays all over the floor and the wall and as a;4
excellent place to stay loved the proximity to times square rockefeller center and the theaters hotel had a retro feel to it the room and bath were very clean and modern we absolutely loved the giant mirror in the room and the lighted mirror in the bathroom with three women getting themselves ready each day the mirrors were a huge help awesome shower too the bell man was awesome and helpful with storing our luggage this hotel totally served its purpose for a girls getaway to nyc;4
the room had minimal space but the bed was comfortable and clean the bathroom was recently redone and the room itself was fairly fresh there is only one elevator so there can be a bit of a wait during the day when the staff is using it to move things from floor to floor the location across from central park was great and it is only a couple of blocks from the subway;4
i chose this hotel due to its location and the expected standard of accommodation i was attending a conference in the queen elizabeth conference centre and need a hotel within walking distance at a reasonable cost;4
we were going to the city to celebrate a family members birthday i decided to booked a room via trip advisor at the new yorker for one night rather than travel back home that evening although i go to the city frequently this was my very first stay at a nyc hotel the new yorker is in a great location walking distance to madison square garden macys herald square and other shopping empire state building etc there is also a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel as well as a starbucks duane reade pizza place and cvs very close by on arrival the hotel lobby was bustling with people front desk personnel were friendly and welcoming checkin took a while their systems were running slow the hallways are narrow and frankly a little dreary my initial room was horribly;4
walking into the hotel lobby was very impressive checkin quick and easy room huge two double beds two bathrooms two closets more than adequate nin room safe lifts there are separate lifts for floors 120 and 21 up the lifts are very quick concierge booked a helicopter flight with them couldnt get us in with the one company on the day we wanted but got us in with another company location perfect close to madison square garden empire state building times square etc we walked absolutely everywhere which i think is the best way to see new york checkout very easy and quick staff very friendly and helpful;4
i stayed in one of the single cabins for two nights the room was very small but welldesigned and quiet a shared bathroom was just down the hall and always very clean the showers were large with dinner plate sized shower heads and good water pressure 4th floor the staff was very professional and friendly the location between the west village and the meatpacking district is excellent just south of the highline but a bit of a walk from the subway lines if you stay here have dinner at barbuto around the corner;4
i chose this hotel for a weekend break in the city during a 2 week business trip to new jersey i wanted an art deco hotel that reflected the glamour of the 30s and 40s new york old school glamour in this respect the hotel largely fulfilled all my expectations as the hotel lobby is nice and impressive with low of art deco features i opted for a slightly upgraded room so i would be on a higher floor with a better view the room was a little small but to be expected in nyc and had some more art deco touches that appealed to me a lot however i found the service to be impersonal and mistrustful with rather spoiled the experience the staff seemed to be on the defensive all the time as if the guests were potential thieves who should be monitored they did not engage in any;4
after we booked this hotel for six nights i read the mostly negative reviews and almost cancelled our reservation we decided to give it a try anyway figuring if it was so bad we could cancel the remainder and find another hotel im glad we did as we were pleasantly surprised i will address all the negative comments i read as compared to our experience we wanted a hotel centrally located between culver city and burbank for movie studio tours and this hotel met that need yes it is not in the nicest area but we didnt think the area was terrible or dangerous if you like to walk to places from your hotel or walk to restaurants nearby then you will probably not like this location however it is only a few minutes drive from many of the major hollywood sites and;4
just back from new york booked this hotel and we were not disappointed lovely room plenty of space nice clean bathroom again plenty of room hotel good location for times square maceys and lots of other places fab hotel really enjoyed our visit here staff very friendly and helpful would book this hotel again no probs thank you wyndham new york staff for a great stay in your hotel;4
why the bestlocation is in the centre of manhatton with both uptown and downtown in easy reach on footby bus and metro the hotel has been refurbished and whilst not large rooms are clean and functionaldining the tick tock 24hr diner is he place for breakfast or fast food diningin addition there is a trattoria and a spankng new steakhouse finally security is very strict no access to lifts without valid key card our first choice in sensibly pticed midtown hotels;4
this hotel is located at the bottom of the hill to universal studios and is an easy 8 minute walk they do offer a free shuttle if you dont want to walk but i think walking is faster it was ideal for early entry for harry potter we were first through the gate and rode with no waits the hotel is very nice great staff clean and spacious rooms my only complaint was lack of affordablefamily friendly dining 60 for a buffet dinner was too steep for my budget;4
great hotel if looking to stay near lax our family of four 2 adults 2 kids stayed in one room for two nights while transitioning through la early flight so hotel shuttle to airport worked very well room was a decent size and recently refurbished good cafe for snacks and quick breakfast double glazing so no aeroplane noise only downside was traffic in and around airport was very heavy to took time to get in and out;4
great value for a very friendly good hotel the check incheck out was easy cold water available in the lobby reasonable bfast rooms had everything we needed easy walking to central park time square and rockefeller center a pleasant surprise for the room rate;4
we stayed at the new yorker when we visited nyc for an event at madison square garden which is just a block away from the hotel checkin was easy the staff helpful and attentive and we liked having the tick tock diner right in the building the room was typical nyc small and not an elegant room but it met our needs for example the bathroom woodwork was chipped and the tile covering in the tub was old but everything functioned well it could have been better cosmetically but didnt affect our stay overall the decor was nice retro design throughout the building and very comfortable i liked that there was always someone checking to see that everyone had a room cardkey before they could enter an elevator so the security was visible daily we also took some;4
i went with my brother for 7 days and enjoyed my stay especially the morning breakfast service from sonia its not the best of areas appearance wise however it was very good for the price and the quality of the rooms were good can do with a little redecoration but im not complaining;4
my wife and i always stay at the empire when in new york city it overlooks the lincoln centre so is perfect if you are visiting new york for the metropolitan opera central park is very close and times square is just a few minutes walk away down broadway the staff are pleasant and helpful the only negatives are that wifi in the room has to be paid for and there is no complementary tea and coffee in the room;4
great location room was spacious and clean good linen on beds and plenty of towels room wasnât ready so we had to wait but that wasnât an issue the room as per other reviews was too hot and we couldnât regulate it but thatâs my only complaint the doorman jeffrey banks is an absolute star got us last minute reservations for nye dinner and totally went the extra mile throughout our stay a credit to you hopefully we will be back soon;4
stayed for 3 nights loved it the rates were great and very clean just a couple blocks to the subway and right across form central park only suggestion is to take a cab to the hotel when u have luggage as the subway that was close didnt have an elevator but the cab to the port authourity was only 1200 would definitely stay there again;4
the hotel is located next to lincoln center and close to central park like most hotels in nyc its pricey but its clean and comfortable and has a nice ambience two seafood restaurants are attached we had a delicious lunch at eds chowder house the rooftop bar is all the rage but we were there on a cold day and didnt venture up all in all a good hotel choice;4
we stayed at the new yorker thanksgiving week we have passed this hotel many times and we finally decided to book it i am glad we did the service is top notch kudos to jessica and linda at the front desk both of them were exceptional in helping us check in there were some issues but it was not their fault we decided to upgrade to get a fabulous view of the empire state building and a view of madison square garden the room was spacious only downside was the bathroom it was very small and you had to be careful with the sink because water would just spray out if you lifted the handle to high nothing major you learned to deal with it location was awesome walking distance to macyâs target kmart and many more stores mcdonalds and a pizza place was across;4
hotel empire is a clean friendly hotel in the heart of lincoln centerclose to ballet opera central park due to its location it gets a bit noisy at night but otherwise very well maintained with trendy decor;4
what an amazing art deco building the interior of the rooms and the hallways felt a little outdated but the lobby was pure nostalgia nice personnel and very convenient that theres a diner next door thats open 247 the location is probably the biggest asset 2 blocks away from herald square 1 block from madison square garden and penn station would definitely stay there again;4
the airport shuttles seem to be very regular even for a 6am departure room was spacious and clean the safe didnât work nor was it repaired after we reported it our room overlooked the runways but was silent we used the outdoor heated pool in january to shake off the inactivity from a syd to lax flight it was just warm enough to do a few laps refreshing we had a casual dinner at their bar restaurant its atmosphere was great good choice of wine but the mexican street food was bland and boring in summary itâs one of the better airport hotels weâve ever stayed in;4
had a double room top floor which was great for my brother and i great location subway nearby the drinks are pricey at the pool but its new york and the view was great so thats the trade off the ac wasnt that good but was good enough and we werent miserable i would stay here again;4
on arrival we were presented with a facilities bill for 88 85 tax receptionist advised that this was for use of hi fi gym free telephone calls i advised that at 70yrs of age neither myself or wife would be using gym nor wi fi nor making any telephone calls she said she could not waive the fee but she could reduce reduce it to 44 tax which i consider a rip off never had a hotel charge for these facilities before not even hilton paddington or thistle group etc i notice this has been raised in other reviews and still wyndham still persist in this fee otherwise the hotel is excellent for the costs it is central to most attractions etc the rooms are spotless our bathroom appears to have been renovated over the last few years the hotel decor is art deco in line;4
a hotel of good standard with good size rooms that is close to penn station a main tube station and macys department store 8 blocks south of times square on 8th avenue ideal for short transfers from newark airport a la cart restaurant and bar also a typical new york diner attached to the hotel;4
just got home after a six night stay at the ameritania times square new yorkthe hotel is modernclean and well situated so cant complain on that frontthe reception staff are happy to check you in but anymore than that well forget it the only saving grace on this front is they have a lovelyfriendlywell mannered and incredibly knowledgeable front doorman called jeffrey jeffnot only is he a gentlemen but a pleasure to talk toand he smells really goodbond no 9so i would like to thank jeff for his help and guidance on my stay in new york this time and also tell the hotel to keep hold of him;4
the hotel nice and friendly staff great breakfast pub in the evenings souvenir shop pool area big parking with automated gates the area outside the hotel didnt feel like something we wanted to explore by foot so we used the car every day the biggest downside is the very expensive parking fee of 30 usd there are parkings on the streets outside so if youre ok with finding your own parking spot and walk to the hotel you got some big savings heading your way there is an atm at the hotel which charges 5 usd for withdrawal water automats on every floor the rooms great beds and good daily cleaning we did not like the shared pathway outside our balcony door although we rarely noticed anyone out there also the entry to the shower was way to small for big sized persons;4
it was my first trip to new york and the location is steps away from the subway so i decided to go with it i will start with the cons there were only 2 small elevators and it was a bit of a wait and the water was warm not hot theres a policy that you can only use the pay phones in the lobby which seemed clean the internet was a bit slow at times i know youre thinking so why such a high mark these people are fantastic here are the pros we arrived early had no problem checking inthe room was neat it was quiet we heard nothing at all there was always someone at the front desk smiling i was expecting 2 packages and im certain i asked for them everyday no one got frustrated they checked each time i asked which was every time i passed the desk when the first;4
the hotel is located at universal city walking distance to city walk great room high floor with park view the staff was very friendly welcome us at check in our room was ready even though we arrived before noon the early check in was great specially after several hours in a overnight flight the hotel is walking distance to city walk where there are several places to eat drink and have fun universal studios hollywood is located there but i found it worse than the one at orlando la is a city that you need car to go from a place to other but if you dont have one like us the hotel has a metro stop nearby and city walk offer several entertainement wed breakfast once at the restaurant great buffet and dine once in room;4
the room was nicely decorated and comfortable but it was on the ground floor with the patio glass doors right on the busy street including a bus stop i had trouble sleeping due to the noise which wasnt a great start since wed just driven seven hours from phoenix the free breakfast was really great with madetoorder omeletseggs and waffles the staff was nice but didnt do anything about our sleepless stay;4
basic accommodation in an excellent location beds were very small breakfast option worth the 10 each front door staff excellent and helpful guy behind the bar was great but on one night there was a woman behind the bar and she tried to charge us twice for drinks very poor;4
i travel to ny often for business and this is the first time ive stayed at the empire hotel i was impressed when i arrived at the hotel with perfect customer service from the doormen to the front desk staff i wish i got the name of the doorman as he was outstanding i did get the name of the front desk attendant nick and he made me feel like i had come home it was so nice because i have been up since 5a and didnt check in until 630p so needless to say i was exhausted the room and bathroom are perfect and i will be back;4
we usually stay at the sheraton when visiting universal studios this last time we decided to try the hilton simply put the hilton is better its location is better its literally a couple minutes to walk to universal studios plus the hilton offers a shuttle never took the shuttle because so close while at the sheraton we had the connecting elevator break down which made walking to universal studios much more difficult sheratons response was basically so what checkin was also better hilton seemed sincerely happy to see us the last couple times at the sheraton it made us feel like they were doing us a favor by us staying there in fairness to sheraton several years ago we had an absolutely fantastic experience with them they greeted us with wine and treated us;4
nice room good view within walking distance of the nearby metro station staff really friendly and helpful proximity to universal studios and citywalk means the hotel is great for families also free shuttle to the studios available;4
we were only here for 1 night but it was a good stay hotel was in arrest location super close to penn station and madison square garden it was a short walk to timessquare we checked in and were given an older room so we went to front desk to switch to a renovated room and if read super easy to switch thank you front desk the renovated room was very nice;4
i booked this as my final leg of the adventure i finally got to see usa the hotel is about an hours walk from the chinese theater i should know as i walked there and back it was okay walking there in the middle of the afternoon but i would not recommend walking back if you are doing it after 5pm as im not frightened of anything but some of the people beggars etc that seem to come out after that time can be pushy the hotel was a great base if you want to use the tube to go to either hollywood or universal studios i did this a few times when i was there and never felt threatened the hotel itself offers a breakfast and fitness facility but i never felt the need to use the latter just outside of the hotel down to the left is a great teriaki takeaway food shop i wish i;4
stayed at ameritania for 4 nights and it was great the room was a decent size and the king bed was very comfy room service came daily even later in the day so i was pleased with the upkeep of the room which was decoreated very nicely and had lots of character the bathroom was really nice but would like to have a shower door but atleast the bathroom was modern and shower was all tile nice bigelow toiletries i wouldve like there to have been a coffee maker with coffee in the room but walk right outside and there are plenty of cafes our room was right across from the elevator so it was loud in the mornings and there was work being done sounded like nailingconstruction right outside our door around 8am on a monday morning so that was no fun outside noise in inevitable;4
was not sure what to expect based on reviews here but was pleasantly surprised the outside of the hotel didnt look like much lobby was basic carpet a little old etc but the room was clean and spacious had two beds just like we asked extras in the bathroom toothbrushes tooth paste slippers it really had everything we needed the location was also great one block from the subway walking distance to second ave e houston restaurants bars etc would definitely stay again;4
yes the rooms are small the bunkbed rooms are big enough to manage two bags in the corner under the window there is some extra storage room under the beds and some hooks for towels or shirts maybe not ideal if you are spending a week or more in the city but for a couple of days this is might be the best value for money shared bathrooms are clean and i never had to wait for any to be available bunkbeds are good but could do with new matresses atmosphere and location are great just around the corner are the riverbank barsrestaurants and beergardens and the subwaytrain;4
this hotel is well located close to lax it provides excellent service and facilities for a short stay in la with easy access for tours and sightseeing it is a well maintained facility the hotel has a good restaurant and bar facility;4
hotel was very nice when you 1st walk in i dont think i ever saw a bar tender or the hotel bar ever open rooms were nice and cozy the beds and black out curtains were everything but the room did not get cold at all put the ac on low for the whole time we were out and it never went under 78 degrees thankful the black out curtins helped keep the room coolish or it would have been a miserable day the next day;4
hotel is well located for lincoln center and surrounds room was reasonable bars ok but not great hard to get a seat at upstairs bar and no consideration given to whether you are a house guest in the hotel were a different company excuse but ultimately diable downstairs staff not that helpful;4
nice rooms we upgraded to a deluxe best shower ever lobby was great got coffee next door at sb met the rest of the party in the lobby rooftop bar with a fantastic view then we found the beautiful bar and restaurant at eds chowder house right in the hotel staff was great everywhere in the hotel convenient to subway and central park wonderful stay;4
we stayed here for too nights located in hollywood but you have to have a car to get around but thats la room was big and nice but they are billing everything even if you park your own car expencive breakfast also a bit tired staff sometimes but not always ok hotel visiting hollywood;4
near airport and great for lay overs we were picking up a cruise leaving the next day hotel was being renovated at the time so there were inconveniences but nothing to worry about food service was limited and expensive;4
had a room for four with two double beds worked well for the family for a few days a very civilized and comfortable room a little tricky to control the temperature with clattery air con but we all slept well;4
my husband is a diamond member of hilton so this was a point stay after looking up the price for the room we were upgraded to i would have to say that it is an expensive place the views are spectacular the staff was so helpful and willing to upgrade us we recieved breakfast and appetizers in the evening it is right across the street from the universal studios theme park and city walk which is a lot of fun they have great buffets for every meal again pricey;4
i visited la on a solo trip and this was my second trip after 2008 i was scared to visit la alone due to the stories i had heard which happen after we cross the 5th street hence i was very careful in selecting the place i will be staying in i went through a lot of reviews and made up my mind to book this hotel upon arrival i took an uber and got dropped to the hotel my experience from the airport to the hotel was great as the uber driver was very nice to help me with my two big sized bags and carefully dropped me to the right place on reaching to the hotel i was greeted with the big smile and the staff at the front desk was very professional they had all the details of my booking and i was checkedin in less than 5 minutes without any waiting i was helped till my room;4
me and my mum stayed here for 5 nights in jan the hotel is an excellent location on the corner of 34th street and 8th ave the room we stayed in was on the 27th floor it was a bit on small side but that didnt bother us as we were only use the hotel as a base the room was lovely and clean and cleaned everyday the only small complaint that i would make is that the room was a little on the cool side obviously there wouldnt be an issue with this if you stayed in the spring or summer all the staff were friendly and super helpful the hotel is in a excellent location with macys just a short walk up 8th avenue and lots of eating places within short walking distance overall and excellent hotel i would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again;4
just recently stayed here and theres not much to fault it is very central youve got maddison square garden just across the road times square about 10min walk empire state building about 1015min walk there are plenty of shops starbucks mcdonalds a pharmacy just outside the hotel which is very handy rooms are a bit small but i think they have character comfy beds tvs iron desk shower and bath although the shower is not great not much power to it the room itself is very clean which is my number one on the list so i was quite happy they have a shop on the ground floor so if you need snacks etc its just there the hotel staff are very friendly and accommodating quick check in and also there is a member of staff before entering the lifts to check your key card;4
just next to the penn station and the madison square garden the location is near unbeatable this is an iconic art deco building with a lot of charm must check out their historical archive on display in the basement while comfortable the rooms are showing age and is good time for them to consider renovation;4
just spent another night in morningside inn been there at least 6 times and again i agree with an earlier reviewer it is an excellent value no the rooms are not enormous and the toiletries are meager but the hotel and rooms are clean and it feels safe and the beds are decent what else you need for the price i dont know if so go pay 35 times the price elsewhere for a place that gives you fancier soapbut for my money and nyc experience the place always fits the bill and i have never had an issue with the front desk or any of the staff in my trips in nyc about 4 times a year i always hope they have a room left and am delighted when they do;4
i travelled solo i felt incredibly safe in my environment and in the hotel my room was gorgeousmouth a great view i loved the complimentary coffee the location was perfect it took no time to get to universal and i could pop back for a coffee and a rest;4
this hotel is an icon within itself check out the little hotel museum in the lower basement yes it is old as it is the same age or older than the empire state building you are not going to find modern luxury at this hotel but the rooms are clean and beds are comfortable our room was on the small side but you are in nyc you do not spend time in your room checkin staff were lovely and as it was our anniversary searched for a room with a view which ended up being on 36 floor location of the hotel is excellent with subway stops surrounding it short walk to esb msg and hudson yards we received a complementary breakfast on the morning of our anniversary food was ok but the restaurant was very busy i would recommend this hotel for a short stay in the city if you want;4
if you are going to universal studios or want to be central to both burbank and los angeles this is a good choice the staff is super nice and helpful the rooms are large clean and well maintained i think the lobby could use some upgrading not because its badly maintained but feels dated the breakfast buffet is very good not great for walking around la since it sits on a hill but very easy to get to city walk via a short walk or a frequent shuttle beware self parking during a large event at the property can be a real problem i valet parked and asked the desk to charge me the self parking rate and they absolutely got it;4
we are a couple traveling with our 6 year old daughter we stayed here saturday to monday we arrived on saturday at 200 pm before checkin time and the front desk staff was very accomodating and got us into a room right away the room was clean and spacious and nicely decorated we had a room with two beds and i noticed that the beds were a little small i think that they were double beds rather than queen size upon getting settled we headed down for an afternoon at the pool the pool is a bit small but had a nice area around it with lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas we found a table to sit at right away but noticed that the rest of the chairs and tables quickly filled up and people had to lay towels on the grass to sit there is a bar by the pool where they were;4
staff was very nice jeff went above and beyond helping my girlfriend and i get to the nyc half marathon on time huge thanks rooms were clean bed was only ok hotel is in a great location close to times square and central park;4
we stayed for three nights and the hotel was great there is a walkway to universal studios and universal citywalk so loads to do and places to eat and shop the hotel was clean the rooms fine and the price very reasonable;4
very comfortable and upmarket hotel rooms are a little bit on the dated side but very well maintained very comfortable king beds and pillows our room was dirty on arrival but rory on reception was excellent and sorted it out straight away and had a porter move us to another room which was lovely great view of universal studios from the room food and room service fantastic pool quite small but nice staff all very nice and courteous up a very steep hill but there is a shuttle bus we took a taxi down to the metro to go to hollywood this is a lovely hotel and although it is not centrally located it was worth the journey as you truly feel like you are a millionaire living high in the hollywood hills plus the beautiful lit up palm trees outside the hotel at night are;4
the empire hotel is superbly located and offers large comfortable rooms i had a king deluxe the staff are helpful and friendly and i will certainly consider returning on future visits to new york my only negative comment i will make is in regards to the hoards of guests myself included who loiter in the lobby area to access the free wifi i felt that this detracted from the ambience and style of the hotel and management should consider offering free in room wifi to discourage this behaviour;4
we stayed here 8 days at first we got a room on the bottom floor it was a bit dark and cold the tiles on the floor made it colder we changed the room for one on the third floor much better it was bigger and even had a balcony the only negative thing was that the wifi connection was much worse in this room the hotel has a very small gym four cross trainer machines and a few weights but its ok the breakfast is average but hugo and company that makes the omelettes are excellent very tasty;4
this hotel is in great location right in the middle of manhattan walking distance from empire state building to madison square garden and 10 min walks from times square if you want to book trips anywhere in the city use the information desk at the hotel and john at this desk is gonna do everything to help you we stayed at tre 8h floor which was recently renovated the room was spacious the washroom small but everything was clean we parked the car 60 a night and you dont get your car until you leave but you dont need it because everything its close by even the subway station we ate at the trattoria bianca at the wyndham hotel and the food was delicious and the service was fast when our waitress heard that it was my bday they brought us a peace of tiramisu with a;4
i liked this big and busy hotel we checked in aroind 1300 and at first they did not find connecting rooms for us it was of course on our reservation but hilton always mention that there are no guarantees for this the guy at the reception stewart really went out of his way to search for one and finally we received our two connecting rooms the rooms kind double queen were spacious and clean so overall we enjoyed our stay very much the main drawback from this hotel is that they charge a lot for wifi 895 a day for each device they also charge for parking location is very good when visiting universal studios walking distance definitely dont bother taking your car or the shuttle it is also convenient to drive from the hotel to hollywood or any other part of;4
lovely staff very attentive and helpful rooms would benefit from refurbishment particularly bathroom but overall a good hotel rooftop bar was excellent in particular nikki from california who had recently started working there also concierge yuri was fantastic and sourced the tickets i required;4
we are currently staying here as it was reasonably close to olympia where we are volunteering for the beer festival the staff have been helpful not overly friendly but they have dealt with all enquiries efficiently the room we have is small but clean and serves the purpose good location for tube and getting around london you need to ask for a hairdryer and put a â£5 deposit down which you get back when you return it which is fair enough room was cheap for london so no complaints so far;4
i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my husband and 13 yr old son staff were lovely helpful rooms were a bit dated but serviced daily its close to the metro 500 metres from station which takes u nth to hollywood and universal city and sth to la cityeasy to get around on we had cooked breakie includedthey make eggs how u like scrambled streamed fried or omelettes plus wafflesmade fresh as u waitparking 22 per nightall in all good value;4
i must say that i enjoyed my stay at the ameritania and yes like most nyc hotels the rooms tend to be on the smaller side however my room was nicely appointed very clean had a nicely sized closet and bathroom loved the shower and the bed was very comfortable yet best of all for its location it was amazingly quiet i slept without a problem didnt even need earplugs lol sadly the only real downer was the lack of wifi in the room you have to pay extra for it i did but i was unable to get it to work although it seems the wifi did work in the hotel lobby without issue luckily i was only in the city for two days so it wasnt a big deal allinall it was a great place to stay and it is right in the midst of the theatre district i would definitely;4
stayed here for one night after a business meeting nearby the staff were excellent from front desk to housekeeping the hotel is the usual high standard but lacked personality as with all large hotels;4
we traveled to ny for a wedding near lincoln center this was the perfect hotel to stay in for our event the location is very nice the subway is just across the street at lincoin center the cabs are always at the hotel and were readily available when we needed them you can walk to central park we also stayed in midtown and this location was much nicer the service was great we were treated like extra special customers the rooms were very nice and the look was dark modern the rooms are very small as in many ny hotels so be prepared we had two double beds we had 3 large bags because of the wedding and there wasnt a good place to put the bags if you have smaller bags it isnt too bad the room was very clean some of the paint was peeling on the bathroom door so it;4
over the last 5 years ive stayed at the jane twice and always enjoyed my stay there if your looking for chain hotel accommodations move on but if you want nice staff in a grand old setting and dont mind a ships quarter for a room you are in for a treat the neighborhood is great and you are close to subways and ground transportation the high line is nearby if youd like to stroll im going back in november and cant wait to hit the lounge downstairs try the jane its a great experience for single and couples travelers;4
we had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel it is literally a 30 second walk from lincon center and the 1 2 and 3 line underneath the hotel has a rooftop restaurantbar with finger foods and drinks which were a bit expensive but par for manhattan two biggest things condition of the rooms and the resort fee the rooms most specifically the bathrooms need updating paint is peeling doors and roughed up etc there are several pictures from other guests so you can find them on here also the resort fee is a joke i will be challenging them as 22 for a hotel that does not have a pool open and i dont intend to use the gym is basically charging you for internet which they arent allowed to do and water otherwise this was a good albeit a bit expensive;4
good quality and reasonable price for an hotel really close to times square and to subway room was clean and with enough space for a family with 2 small daughters really nice view on the city and friendly staff;4
stayed here in may 2013 and had a wonderful experience the service was terrific great location with wonderful nearby restaurants and minutes to walk in central park very convenient for riding the subway and felt that this was a very safe area the accommodations were very nice and loved the modern decor the hotel staff could not have been more courteous and accommodating;4
had two nights in la with my 13 year old daughter hotel is your typical well presented hilton with great service a few extra touches thrown in and good quality but overpriced food the views from the hotel were fantastic and the pool area was in a lovely garden the location is fantastic while no hotel in la is central at least it was just a short and easy stroll to universal studios and the adjacent shopping precinct we didnt use the train but the station is close by;4
we stayed 6 nights and had 5 rooms the hotel has an excellent location for getting around the city the rooms are small but comfortable and well equipped the hotel offers good value for money the staff were friendly and helpful particularly jeff and jalal who provided excellent advice and support all in all a great trip if only the weather had not been so bitterly cold;4
the location is excellent there are plenty of security and concierge people to help my room was tiny although fairly modern wifi worked very good the rooms are quite noisy all day and night from city noise including police sirens at lowfrequency rumblers which shake everything the hotel needs to invest more in soundproofing for a hotel of this price range would it be so hard to have a minifridge come standard with the room another issue check in we checked in at 1 am and had to wait about 10 minutes for the 1 guest in front of us who chatted incessantly with the front desk staff at least we didnt check in during the day time the 2 days we were there the line was often 30 people deep the fitness center was phenomenal huge with quite a few aerobic and;4
i booked the hotel to celebrate my friends birthday and chose a superior queen room loved the location away from times square nightmare the staff were friendly and efficient big shout out for nick on the front desk nothing was too much trouble the room was much larger than expected compared to other cramped new york hotel rooms plus we received a complimentary bottle of bubbly for my friends birthday although the roof bar was sadly closed for a private function i will definitely return next time with my family;4
ive stayed at this property 3 times this year and have been pleased everytime if your business takes you to the studios this is an ideal location if your trip is for pleasure and you plan on going to to universal studios look no further this is your place location see above but be aware that there is precious little else in the immediate vicinity of universal studios to be sure a 15 minute drive can get you to a ton of good restaurants but the area immediately adjacent has little to recommend it restaurant ive only had breakfast but it was a very good if not inexpensive buffet staff good folks always helpful none of the artificial snootiness one can find closer to beverly hills room clean comfortable air conditioning works endless supply of hot;4
the best part about this hotel is the location itâs close to all the shops not far from the likes of the empire state building and has easy access to the subway our room was small and a little dated but it didnât bother us the bed was very comfy and the hairdryer provided was very good also having the tick tock diner in the lobby was ideal and i would definitely recommend visiting there the doorman frankie was very helpful with organising taxis to the airport and the employees at left luggage were also very friendly a couple of negatives unfortunately the first being the check in process the woman wasnât friendly at all and acted like we were a huge inconvenience also you have to pay to leave luggage at the hotel when you have checked out we left 2 suitcases and 2;4
location location location stay in this hotel if you need to be near penn station or madison square garden close to macys and the empire state building this was medium priced with excellent service and very attentive staff however the rooms are extremely small the low prices that you will get on;4
i have been hunting for a decent budget hotel in nyc a quest of a lifetime i know i stumbled across the jane a hotel originally designed for sailors with small rooms some with bunks i stayed this last weekend and enjoyed my stay the room was tiny and very warm but clean and comfortable and the bathrooms down the hall we just fine and kept up well the staff were friendly and helpful the downsides due to hurricane sandy there was no internet and no elevator i requested no higher than the third floor and while my room number started with a three i was actually on what americans would consider the fourth floor though i think i was on the lowest floor they had with twin bunks i plan to stay again but man i hope the elevators are working again;4
i find reviews can be influenced by good or bad experiences and might not always be the fault of the hotel i would take an average from the good and bad reviews and look for similar groups to yours we actually stayed dec 2011 but that wasnt an option from the website this was my mine and my wife 2nd visit to new york and we wanted to stay in a slightly different area and a little further away from some of the main tourist areas than we had previously we came across the jane in the west village and i have to say were very pleased with the find this is in a very nice area to wander around with a great selection of restaurants billyâs cupcake the spotted pig pastis spasso bars shops and so on even though it is out of the way it is easy to get to the more;4
our son recently moved near this area and we stayed at the hilton on our visit last week the location service and room size were perfect the breakfast buffet was extremely fresh and extensive you can walk to universal studios and the views are great from the rooms this will be our place to stay on future visits;4
very convenient facility to lax and immediate vicinity theyre trying hard to accommodate for covid issues so some services were limited standard king room is spacious but only shower no tub available ample outlets to charge all devices but water glasses and coffee cups were not found in room overall satisfactory experience but not outstanding;4
this was a good stay to be on the manhattan island at an affordable price located upper west side this is in walking distance to central park and broadway so good access to subways shared bathroom and kitchen which was fine private room was clean and included a fridge;4
the hotel is very nice and clean the beds are probably in the top 5 most comfortable bed ive ever slept in outside of home the only reason i didnt give it a 5 is the staff upon arrival was not texas courteous when they had us stash our luggage in a room rushed snappy added an element of uncomfortable otherwise the hotel is centrally located nice easy and i would recommend it;4
stayed at this hotel for five nightsand found it very good rooms are large and well furnished with very good facilities and wonderful views if you are visiting universal studios it is only five minutes walk away and the metro station is at the bottom of the hill so you can visit anywhere very easily and cheaply my tip would be to pay the extra and have an executive room as you are on a higher floor and have access to the lounge where you can get coffee and a good breakfast overall i would rate this hotel as excellent;4
a strange hotel but id still recommend it as part of a deal the location is excellent close to public transport and a few things to look eat at around even though the area isnt too pricey while i was given a room for disabled users by luck it was very very big on the other hand the cleanliness of the toilets and the bath area was borderline good some marks were left on the towels and a bit of mould on the shower not bath the staff at reception were just about civil saying anything to them including checking in made me feel like i was disturbing them although they didnt have a problem with my leaving my luggage in their office 3 hours before checkin time fairly decent choice of food at breakfast which was served until quite late in the morning there;4
i usually read reviews before i book anything ive read that people were not that excited about the hotel itself but liked the location we really liked the location tooyou walk to universal studio and you can be there right when they open and stay as late as you want and you dont have to be worried about paying or finding parking to go to the studio the lobby is nice and buffet breakfast was great the hotel itself is not luxury or high end but not that bad either we liked it for just the location and breakfast;4
we stayed at the empire hotel march 14 2012 this is a truly different and better hotel since their renovation rooms are small but nicely decorated front desk personnel friendly and helpful excellent location for lincoln center the only negative is that in addition to the minibar there is a pile of snack food and wines on the desk for sale at minibar prices this is tacky if you dont want this stuff in your room they will charge you to remove it;4
a really nice hotel in hollywood it is on a busy road might be a little bit loud if you have a room looking to the street but not sure about that as i got a room looking to the garden the breakfast is good you have pancakes sausages oj cereals egg etc also some flat tvs on the wall to watch while eating the room is big enough the bed is perfect the cleanliness is ok new towels every day they also have a private parking area but they charge 15 for a night which is a lot of many just for parking all in all it is worth the money i would recommend it;4
stayed in january excellent location great base for getting about room was ok but had to ask for another bed to be set up in the room as the room classed as a twin so 2 small beds was given except there were 3 in our room did request a room with a view prior to going as it was our first ny visit and my 50th birthday we were given a room looking into a grotty rear courtyard coffee machine in room was a bonus although had to request this too rooms clean and tidy staff not the friendliest;4
it was my 3rd stay at this hotel reason i keep choosing it is that it is strategically located making it easy to travel by subway just outside the hotel you could jump on lines a c e which by the way also connects to jfk airport at walking distance you can reach almost all the other subway lines which is a good advantage whether you are in nyc for business or leisure reason times sq macys and empire state building are amongst some of the places at walking distance tick tock diner offers good food and friendly staff we didnt have any problem with waiting time for the lifts and all staff is friendly hotel though needs refurbishment mattresses in our room were quite bad and windows fails to isolate you from noise and cold but i understand that is already;4
we chose this hotel because of its location and we were not disappointed the rooms are very small but we spent no more than an hour a day awake in our hotel room so this wasnât a problem at all the staff were very very friendly and helpful we would definitely stay here again;4
i stayed in march for three nights and loved this hotel i did have an issue with my room but the hotel kindly refunded me one of the nights a few weeks after i got home my room had a problem with the heating but it was unusually cold in nyc that weekend and the only other room available had the same problem many blankets later i was a cozy to sleep but the room was too cold to sit in anyway the hotel management was fantastic and followed up with my feedback this is the kind of service we want from places we stay so i will go back location is great decor unique and the vibe is sweet go the jane;4
i loved the lobbydark mysterious and with gorgeous chandeliers we were upgraded from the typical nyc shoebox room to a regularsized queen room but the bathrooms must all be the same size because this one was tiny and the shower didnt have a door or curtain so the floor got wet but besides that everything was wonderful even being woken up by sirens multiple times during the night whats more new york than that;4
each year when we go to see the macyâs thanksgiving day parade in the hersld square area we stay at tha wyndham new yorker perfect location excellent security and hotel services and most appreciatedâindoor access to the tick tock diner a place that offers quality meals 247 at low low prices compared to outside the hotel love the views from the upper floors too we always feel safe and comfortable at the new yorker and will be back next november for sure;4
wonderful stay one of the better hotel stays we experienced desk staff very friendly and helpful door man terrific we have already recommended ameritania to business associates and will continue to do so thank you ameritania for making our nyc stay relaxed and enjoyable;4
great location for sub way around l a rooms comfortable clean and have microwave and fridge the only gripe is there is no wardrobe just a hanging rail breakfast great and the two guys who cook the omelettes and waffles make your day ask for a strawberry teddy waffle btw the picture shown is the rear of the hotel from car parkbut the pool area is great for a relax at the end of the day would reccommend;4
this place will most definitely become a location for the hip cool we had some drinks in the bar although the service was a bit to cool for school the drinks were good and the vibe was nice the only couple of things i would say is that the ac is cranked up so high i had to put my coat back on and secondly at around 10pm as the bar was filling up they asked us to give up our bar stools so they could clear them away;4
we stayed at the hilton during the busy spring break period earlier this year the hotel room was a little âtiredâ compared to some other hiltonâs i have stayed at recently but the obvious benefit advantage of the property is the fact that it is in walking distance of universal studios if you are feeling less energetic there is a shuttle that will take you up to the park being a gold hilton honors member have since upgraded to diamond i was entitled to a complimentary continental breakfast instead of the continental breakfast you can also order off the a la carte menu up to a set value i found this option better value than the continental if visiting the park again i would definitely book into the hilton again attached a photo of my son posing with vin diesel;4
having read countless reviews about this and other new york hotels we were slightly worried however there was no need the hotel was fine the room 406had a view of central parkwas a decent sizehad a kingsize bedwas cleangood bathroom with endless hot water maid changed towels and made room daily subway was 5 mins walk away turn right out of hotel and walk to 103st travel time to midtown 10 mins an ideal base away from the hustle and bustle but close enough not to be an issue would go back again dont be over critical the room is just your base if budget is not an issue try trump towers mind you i suppose some would even critcize that;4
clean smart pretty good restaurant we always lay over a night on our way from asia to the us and this is our goto last time we saw it had been renovated now even better the only downside was the super slow desk and bellboy service upon arrival we always come in after 8pm and it is always the same short staff;4
i found the rates at the empire hotel very reasonable and it was really a great stay the hotel is in a little bit less busy area and is two blocks from central park great shopping nearby and lincoln center is a great place to have a takeaway breakfast lunch or dinner the hotel is clean staff are very friendly luis at the front desk was extremely helpful to get me a room at a good rate at the last minute the hotel has a nice bar in the lobby and a rooftop restaurant and pool the room was small like most in new york and the aircon was extremely loud nice decor and set up in room though i like a room with a real shower and not the showerinbath set up all the normal amenities included really a great stay;4
nice hotel room lobby and staff nice and helpful and in a great location by far the highlight was vip access to the rooftop bar this wasnt an issue during the week but when we arrived back at the hotel on saturday evening after a day at the races and saw the massive line to get up there the vip status paid dividends;4
the new yorker hotel had its heyday in the 1930s it was aging when wyndham bought the hotel and it has been under renovation for the last decade now the rooms are larger and comfortable simple furnishings the bed was comfortable the bathroom was small but well appointed the lobby is elegant and right now decorated for the holidays there is a connected italian restaurant on the left and a famous breakfast retaurant the tick tock on the right its across the street from madison square garden penn station is under the garden at 34th street youre a few blocks from the empire state building if you turn left and walk about 12 blocks you run into times square with its many broadway shows its a great location;4
recomend the jr suite great location glad that i chose the empire the front desk staff was fantastic i did not dine in or attend the hotel lobby bar the rooms could use brighter light i was there for business;4
great location just next to broadway close to subways times square and central park staff was always helpful doormen greeted every time helped with luggage special thanks to jeff and the curly haired black man breakfast was too american no veggies or healthy sandwich toppings available;4
we really enjoyed staying at this hotel my family and i were staying there because we were attending the teen choice awards held at the universal citywalk check in went smoothly and the view from the room on the 19th floor was great the pool was great and service superb we went to the hollywood attractions from there and it was easy to get there using a back way from the hotel also i waited in line 6 am for tonight show tickets with success for that evening nbc is not far from the hotel one memory of the hotel would have to be when 20 lamborghinis pulled up to the front of the hotel to eat lunch they had a lamborghini club;4
close to the met yay the old empire was more charming with all the opera themes and classical music playing come on this is lincoln center it feels more like an african safari whoever did the decor is out of touch and may we please have complimentary water in the room coffee tea anything;4
a great base for a few nights of sightseeing the hotel is under going much needed renovations but we werent disturbed in any way by this thanks to all the hard working staff we are especially grateful to leyla in reception who was very helpful and friendly;4
the hotel is dated but the price is right and we still liked it clean larger rooms they catered to all our requests eg we wanted a rollaway bed and they didnât charge us for it the breakfast was good the front desk were great and very helpful we spent nye around the pool it was a great atmosphere we enjoyed lovely champagne and snacks not too over priced the pool was heated so the children really enjoyed swimming even though it was winter;4
the hilton universal studios is a big hotel that is constantly busy events and large groups is what seems to be their best business and individual travelers does not seem to matter at times upgrades are never available the hotel seemed to be sold out every day and it does need a major make over;4
hotel is in a good location stag is friendly and helpful we had a suite with a view of the empire state building the rooms are dated and bathrooms as well but expected with the age of the hotel the cleanliness and comfort of the bed was decent though although they have multiple elevators during busy times give yourself time as they are full and difficult to get into;4
had an excellent time at hollywood hotel we got there about 2am and check in was a breeze was in bed within 10 15 minutes and that included booking a tour to disneyland the staff were always helpful we needed a few things printed out and they said just email it to them and they will print it out for us which we did and they printed it out no worries the bed and room was very comfy the only thing was the bed creaked a bit every time we moved which was no big deal for us we booked a couple of tours through them to disneyland and a hollywood tour and they were excellent and everything went smoothly the free breakfast everyday was great and the free wifi worked excellently only one gripe i had was that i booked a taxi through the front desk to staples centre to watch;4
i liked the style of this hotel and the friendly staff the only thing that was annoying was the cold stream of air at the floor of my room had to wear winter shoes all the time when not in bed while in bed i kept my socks on as others noted the shower is hard to adjust temperature stream;4
this hotel is ideally close to the garden and penn station the staff was welcoming and the room was clean i was super impressed by the workout room my only complaint was the smokey smell of the hallways;4
stayed here for 3 nights flew from uk with virgin atlantic and they recommend this hotel check efficient staff friendly room was a bit small but comfortable although didnât spend much time in it anyway key thing about this hotel is great location for site seeing;4
really liked this hotel a lot of character to the place with interesting decor great location in the village really nice and helpful staff room at the shabby chic end of the spectrum but given the price this is fair enough cafe gitane is really good would stay there again;4
we booked last minute and were told the only rooms available were ones with double beds however when we arrived the woman behind the counter delighted us by saying we were getting a free upgrade to a suite the room was huge in addition to the bedroom it had a separate room with a large closet couch television and a keurig setup it was very comfortable and spacious to hang out in the staff also provided us with an extra set of blankets which i had requested for comfort we were very pleased with the room and service my only gripe is that the pillows were very thick which caused me a great deal of neck pain but thats because i have neck issues that aside i would stay here again while bringing a pillow from home;4
excellent hotel if you are going to universal studios we timed our walk and it took a bit less than 5 mins to walk from the hotel to universal obviously it is expensive but everything in la is mary anne at the front desk was awesome and there was a bell hop that helped us with our luggage he was from montreal and he was fantastic the rooms need a good clean though the window ledges were so dirty no one touched them in all three of the rooms were in if you want an awesome view of universal and the harry potter light show at night ask for rooms 196766 we would definitely stay here again if going to universal studios;4
very friendly front desk staff michael g very responsive to our needs knowledgeable about the area assisting us as needed rooms efficientprice comparable clean and neat comfortable stay would return again housekeeping staff always cleaned room very well;4
we have stayed here before and would stay here again just try to avoid room 214 the great restaurant breads has opened across the street what a great place to grab a quick bite lincoln centre is across the street on the other side we felt safe walking home from theatre in the evenings;4
staff was very helpful ny is expensive but nice place not 5 star but was not unhappy about our stay did not spend much time in the hotel they could improve on internet too expensive should have some limited availability for free;4
my daughters and i stayed two nights in the new yorker in early june 2017 it was a last minute booking due to a change in our schedule given the price and location i figured id give it a go and im glad i did i wont belabor you with a long conde nast traveller style blog here and will focus on what i figure matters to most travelers checkincheckout quick and painless the grandly restored lobby kept my daughters attention while i went through the front desk two step desk staff were friendly polite and well dressed checkout was even easier dropped the key cards in the drop box and headed out rooms we stayed on the 34th floor and had a great view of the city including a fine view of the empire state building the room was clean with comfy beds and;4
we enjoyed our stay at the ameritania the room was clean and we never heard noise from adjoining rooms the location is superb very close to central park and the theater district jeffrey was very helpful in getting us whatever information we needed including how to utilize the subway system to visit the 911 memorial we noticed he gave each guest his attention and engaged them with his sincerity he is a huge asset the entire staff was gracious there was noise from outside but that is difficult to avoid in a city the biggest drawback is with the modern furnishings there is limited storage and definitely a lack of space in the bathroom as there is virtually no countertop however the updated shower was very enjoyable;4
my wife and i stayed at the empire hotel for the nyc marathon in a junior suite room we had a great time and enjoyed the hotel the location was perfect for the end of the marathon i would stay here again with out question my only compliant is it is a little pricey;4

we had two adjoining rooms for our family of 6 as we arrived early we were advised the rooms were not yet ready however one of the rooms was quickly made up so we could at least get into that the friendly staff member was helpful and nothing was too much trouble as hilton diamond members we enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast each morning for a very low price we also received complimentary drinks and appetizers at the bar each night this was a nice touch the rooms were spacious and clean the beds very comfortable the pool area was great lots of comfortable sun lounges and the pool towels thick and plentiful great location for universal studio and the citywalk and only a short walk to the metro which was a stop from hollywood we travelled on the metro on several;4

great experience during our 4 day stay at the empire for my wifes birthday friendly helpful staff with modern amenities restaurant and bar were both well maintained slow wifi however a small issue in the overall stay;4
we stayed here for 5 nights with a change of room since we had a gap of a day the first room we had was on the 22nd floor and was quite cramped while the second one on the 25th floor was very spacious with 2 bathrooms both the rooms had no real views the first room was quite noisy during the night while the othe one was really quiet both the rooms were very clean and so were the bathrooms the beds were spotlessly clean and there were reasonable amount of toiletries in the bathroom a coffee machine is not there by default and you are provided one if you ask for it one thing which we found weird was the fact that the bathrooms cant be locked from inside the insulation around the windows is suspect and some cold wind keeps leaking in but the room is heated so it wasnât a;4
we stayed almost two weeks at the hotel the overall impression of the hotel is that it is a hotel we would recommend the reason for our recommendation are 1 central location located just accros the penn station 2 the staff was very helpful mohammed was especially helpful our son had some medicin that required to be kept at max 5 degrees celcius mohammed arranged that we could get a refrigerator brought up to our room 3 the speed and stability of the free internet was good 4 nice bar the only not so positive was 1 the bathroom was not so big 2 the hotel looked a bit worn its a hotel we would use again in case we come back to new york;4
great location near the park lincoln center and columbus square rooms were small and dark and bathroom sink was poorly designed and drained slowly room was direct billed to the conference i was attending so cant comment on value but did not see or experience any of the problems mentioned in earlier reviews regarding the cleanliness of the room service or noise;4
loved room and location it can get noisy though as walls thin 5 stars for cafe sierra staff for breakfast and dinner wonderful service for food allergies nothing too much trouble fantastic location for universal and warner bros tours our day tour starline also picked up from this hotel we caught subway out from central union square 175 each so easy and quick just 1520 mins very safe to walk over to universal walk at night time and there is a shuttle but we walked everywhere would return to this hotel;4
the empire hotel was in a great location to visit family lincoln center right across the street and easy subway access although the hotel was on the older side our room was very comfortable and quiet our window overlooked lincoln center which was very pretty to see in the day and night checkin took a little longer than expected but they did add another desk clerk which helped;4
we were very happy with our stay at the hotel the restaurant staff were excellent very helpful and polite the room was quite large and well equipped my only complaint is the was three of us booked to stay in the room my wife and our grandson and myself but there were only two towels when my wife explained to reception and asked for another towel she was told to say please this infuriated me other than that our stay was very nice eamonn davies portsmouth;4
we stayed there just for one short night but it was a pleasant stay large lobby quick checkin we had a suite made for up to 4 persons two rooms and two bathrooms the location is really nice very central with good restaurants in the neighborhood the hotel is old and genuine which you can notice on the bathroom which is small rooms could be more modern or european perhaps but that is what i like everything worked well even though it was a labyrint to find the room at 20th floor elevators worked perfect and there were plenty of them i have no problem to recommend this hotel to any of my friends;4
we stayed at the new yorker 13th dec to 17th dec checkin was a smooth process with friendly staff a security deposit was taken and we didnât have to pay the facilities fee as we booked with virgin holidays if you are looking for a reasonably priced accommodation look no further than here it doesnât have the wow factor but it does have comfy beds and clean rooms with great housekeeping;4
we stayed here for three nights while in ny for a billy joel concert at madison square garden the property needs updating but our room was comfortable the staff was excellent the price was reasonable and security was great always someone on duty checking room keys before you could get into the elevator this hotel was built in the 1930s and a good deal of the charm remains the location cant be beat kittycorner from msgpenn station and within walking distance of times square empire state building and if youre game rockefeller center lots of decent restaurants and bars nearby check out the bar in the basement occupying a space once used by a bank you can even get a table in the vault the service there was excellent as with checkin cleaning staff etc;4
stayed at the new yorker for 3 nights before joining a cruise which was subsequently cancelled location was superb great if you like walking as we walked to most of the attractions even the statten island ferry albeit a long way on arrival check in was really quick and efficient with friendly staff we had a problem with the cleanliness of the shower on the first night and crystal was superb in recognising the problem and moved us to a far nicer room next time we would definitely ask for one of the refurbished rooms as the previous room was quite dated we ate in the restaurant one night and the meal was fantastic would definitely return;4
this hotel is in a great location to downtown attractions walking distance from time square and broadway hotel was beautiful and the rooms were a little on the small side but comfortable great views of the city and it was quite and safe there was a rather long line a check in and we had small issues with guest services but all were handled quickly to our satisfaction i truly feel like we got the best bang for our buck and would recommend this hotel to anyone;4
my wife and i recently had a fabulous week in marrakech staying at the riad the ladies at the reception canât do enough for you and the restaurant recommendations and cooking course arranged were highlights we loved the fruit around the riad and tea whenever we wanted it thanks for a great week;4
i had not been to nyc in many years chose this hotel based on reviews to stay for one night since we had tix to a broadway show we were lucky to have matt to check us in as the other guy had terrible customer service he did not smile and was giving his patron attitude matt however was very friendly and helpful matt was able to get us in our room early and he even left a bottle of wine cupcakes and a note in our room later on because i had mentioned we were celebrating my daughters birthday the hotel is modern the rooms are very tiny and some of the furniture is worn the colors are not appealing at all brown and black the bathroom was nicely updated and very clean it was an easy walk to our show and nice not to be in the middle of times square noisy at;4
great location for shopping restaurants food and lincoln center the empire hotel is our standard hotel for nyc visits because of the proximity to our business locations lincoln center prefered restaurants and shopping;4
at the last minute i decided to move from my nj hotel close to office location into nyc for my lincoln center work event after a brief search on priceline i found a 209 rate a huge surprise for this 4star property considering its mercedesbenz fashion week at lincoln center and the neighborhood is all a buzz with fashion types i have a basic queen sized room one bed bath desk facing lincoln center and its great comfy bed nice linens and a useless minibar wish they would stop this wasted amenity the front desk cage me a 20 discount card on the attached seafood restaurant chowder house where i ate by myself one night and had a company group dinner for 10 the next night everyone enjoyed i would suggest a local market if you want bottled water the;4
stayed with friends for two nights we were able to leave luggage before checking in and after which was useful the staff were fine and the rooms were clean if you are going to be out and about most the day and night it is great place to stay as super cheap meaning you can spend more being out and about we had a good experience as was expecting it to be like the other reviews this year which were poor;4

first off i would like to say that it was top notch customer service a lot of staff walking around ready to help you when i needed amenities for the room they took care of it right away the check in was a bit of a wait but not bad our room was quite spacious compared to the average hotel room we noticed the fridge was missing from the room so i reported it and a fridge was brought up within minutes our room was also missing the advertised chair and ottoman but i didnt realize this until after we got homethe only con i would have to say is that the bathtub on the outside near the floor had a 7 inch thick scratch which was quite rusted and im surprised that maintenance didnt repair this prior to renting the room room jesse at the concierge desk was;4
warmly welcomed by ashleigh and sophie at this very quirky hotel the room size is a bit of a shock at first but while it is compact and it is also efficient you grow to love your room by the end of your stay especially as you dont really spend much time in it in new york and in particular this lovely corner of the city having not been in a shared bathroom type accommodation in years it was a very pleasant experience as they were always impeccable and never too crowded you could see that the other guests were also clean decent folk the ac system was a little on the noisy side but higher rooms dont have this problem and you soon dont notice it i had a small problem on my first night where i found a couple of bed bugs but the staff at the jane were extremely;4
we visited the new yorker with friends and found all the staff friendly and efficient from the concierge who took our bags from the taxi to the reception and restaurant staff a special mention to the lovely samira who was so very helpful our rooms whilst in need of redecoration were clean with very comfortable beds and powerful showers the facility fee paid direct to the hotel includes wiif and use of the telephone in the bedroom we also had to pay a deposit of 45 per night which was refunded after our return home we were not aware of this so it did put a hole in our budgeted spending money it would be better to simply hold the credit card details and debit the money if any damage is found the tick tock diner was good for basic food the cakes looked delicious but;4
charming decor extremely friendly staff and a great deal the attached cafe is delicious and they offer room service without any exorbitant charges which is fantastic on those mornings when you are hungry but maybe stayed up a little late the night before the communal bathrooms were always clean and the little touches in the little room water nice tv radio and ipod docking station etc made it a comfortable place to kick back after a long day i didnt get a chance to check out the rooftop or the lounge but i have heard good things also a great location close to the high line shops restaurants and more it would be nice if there communal bathrooms werent unisex however that said i had no issues with it while i was thereso really just a minor thing also;4
the location of the new yorker is phenomenal incredibly central to shopping and the subway the hotel is very busy with international tourists american tourists business meetings and people staying over for in town business even with the continued flow of people throughout the hotel the common areas were always clean and neat i have no idea how they could keep up the front desk people the doorman and the concierge were pleasant helpful and wearing smiles at all times our room was a city view double on the corner the room was quiet spacious clean and decorated in a comfortable yet minimalist vibe the bathrooms are very small when compared to current hotel trends but i have to say the shower never ran short of hot water our view was incredible the;4

this hotel has a excellent location you can visit universal studios and city walk in a few minutes also you can get walked there is a little bit expesive and the internet conexion is charged by dispositive no good also you can visit chinese teater and walk of fame in 10 minutes by car;4
great location wonderful staff i was welcome with nice welcome fruits in room with excellent service breakfast is best nice restaurant and location is great i will recommend everyone to make this hotel as one place to stay when you are in la especially like to visit universal studios and hollywood signgoing to stay again in december;4
we have stayed many times at the empire hotel over the years it is nice but not extravagant and rooms are on the smallish side like most in nyc it has a nice lobby good fast elevators very quiet rooms for being right in the city and attentive staff it is reasonably priced but its best selling point is the fact that lincoln center is just across the street it is very easy to get across the street and under cover even if it is raining the broadway subway line has a stop two blocks away with an elevator for handicap access and colombus circle is just a brief 3 block walk with other subway lines available entry to central park is a 2 block walk there is a nice starbucks just out the front door and lots of very reasonable to intermediate priced restaurant choices;4
if you want to stay in a beautiful area of nyc with shops cafes restaurants bars and tourist attractions all close by and not pay the cities high prices then this is your hotel theyve done a wonderful job keeping the historic look and feel of this hotel intact and it just helps you fall in love with it even more the survivors of the titanic were brought here and you get a wonderful feeling of what how the hotel was back then the captains cabins are a perfect size for a couple the cafe down stairs does great food rooftop is great for sunset drinks and the bar is happening all weekend we loved the free bikes as the city is so flat compared to sydney that its so easy to get around for those that are light sleepers be aware that the bar downstairs gets busy so a lot of;4
the decor style is very impressive to me and the location is convenient to shopping nearby its conference rooms are very accommodating and suitable for meetings overall its a good place to be and i will eventually visit again;4
fast check incheck out dont park onsite there is easy and cheap off site parking room could have been a bit cleaner better vacuumed but a good value for the price clean safe and updated looking hotel;4
when i travel to nyc i always stay at this wonderful hotel everyone is always helpful and kind love this hotel;4
the hotel is new or recently renovated the rooms are large enough everything was in very good working condition the room service and restaurant selection wasnt huge but covered the basics and was tasty the cons were the wifi which was extremely slow and unreliable meased 12mbps on speedtest the valet parking was expensive at 55 per day or 45 selfparking and of course traffic in la is a mess getting to hollywood or to any of the parks is over an hour in traffic so its not a good place to use as your base to explore the la area but the shuttle to the airport is good and its a 6 minute ride only;4
itâ´s in a good place near central park people are friendly this is a renovated hotel you can see this hotel in gossip girl there is a pool in the last floor but they almost never permite to enter there itâ´s a shame they should and there is a nice bar and restaurant;4
great hotel close to universal studios and city walk clean and comfortable with great views over the valley service with a smile and a shuttle for easy access to universal citywalk which has a range of restaurants;4
my wife and i come to our home state of california a few times a year we especially like to visit in october for all the various halloween events halloween horror nights at universal studios dark harbor at the queen mary etc etc this is our second time staying at this hotel because of its close proximity to universal studios and citywalk we can just walk on over to the park whenever we like we chose a room with a king size bed our room was on the 17th floor 1773 there is valet and self parking available self park is in a garage below the hotel the fee is 28 a night a little high but not ridiculous honestly its the only negative i have about the hotel check in was a breeze and our room had the amenities we enjoy mainly a refrigerator a coffee maker was in the;4
as a general statement it was very good experience hotel location is great hotel staff are nice and helpful room is clean and kept clean the rest room and showers are clean room size is quite small around 220 by 180 m although very well managed so there is place to arrange items;4
we really enjoyed our stay at the universal studios hilton we were not sure if we wanted to stay at the hilton or the other hotel just down the hill we are so glad that we made the perfect choice thank you hilton we will be back;4
my wife two kids 7 5 and i just got back from a few night stay we had a corner suite and it was great the room and the location was perfect for us the room was absolutely perfect by my rough measurements the area with with the table desk sofa and chair was 20 x 14 and the room with the king was 11 x 14 the bathroom was roomy enough with a wall shelf unit and sink cabinet with drawers the bedroom had a wardrobe 4 draw dresser and two night stands when we asked for linens for the sofa bed to our surprise they had set the bed up in addition they brought a pleather covered mattress to go on top of the regular sofa mattress making it more comfortable my kids had no problem sleeping on it there are many negative comments about the elevators but i did;4
first let me say i wouldve given them five stars if there was a laundry room other than that let me tell you how convenient this hotel was it was about a 6min walk to universal studios and if we didnt want to walk there is a free shuttle thatll take you to universal city walk lots to do lots of places to eat and if those food places isnt your cup of tea right down the road on ventura blvd is a mess of dining options with the bonus of a trader joes in the mix always a treat for hawaii folk ð with all that being said book it the staff is great location is better ill be back for sure;4
great value for money the location is a bonus central park is a short walk north times square to the south easy subway access to take you uptown or downtown great choice of restaurants nearby rooms are comfortable and clean staff very friendly and helpful especially jeff at the front door and alexis at reception will definitely stay here again;4
we stay at the empire hotel because of its location since our reason for visiting new york city each year is the metropolitan opera there are some drawbacks to the hotels outdated physical plant tiny bathrooms inadequate lighting poor space for hanging clothes heatingcooling system that has a few surprises dark hallways but the staff is very friendly and accommodating eugene the bellman was very cheerful and helpful as was the concierge our favorite breakfast waitress is a young hardworking woman who is studying nursing and has several children she has worked in the restaurant for a number of years and we look forward to seeing her each time im embarrassed to admit we dont recall her name;4
the empire is directly across the street from lincoln center so the location is walking distance to broadway central park etc and close to subway lines its an older hotel and not as spiffy as some but we had a junior suite that was great roomy windows on two sides just perfect for us a few minor details dimly lighted bathroom expensive internet access didnt detract from an overall positive experience great value;4
one of my sons and i decided to do a weekend in new york to take in as much theater as we could we were able to book the hotel empire which is just across from the lincoln center also you are very close to columbus circle and central park we had driven into the city and there is a parking garage nearby with a hotel rate of 40 a day which is reasonable rate in nyc both of us like to walk and enjoyed strolling around the neighborhood the room was clean and the staff was great the shower was fantastic for someone tall like myself the shower head comes directly out of the ceiling however there is only one shower door making it difficult to keep all the water inside the shower this is not by accident i asked the staff and all the rooms only have one door the room;4
i visited here with my daughter it was a nice place the halls and rooms were dated but very clean it was very convenient to penn station time square was a bit of a walk but the price was worth the time spent walking i probably would try and stay closer to time square next time because i am ill and the walk was a bit much for me the staff was very pleasant and accommodating;4
hotel was clean enough the staff were mostly very pleasant to deal with the pillows and beds leave much to be desired the shuttle to the airport is very convenient we did have a small issue and it was promptly corrected with a phone call;4
surprise everything was fine location proximity to train and bus terminal close to times square but the check out moment was a blow with facility fees obviously there was no mention of such fees upon reservation and full payment with amtrak bookings in fact we thought we had a fairly good deal i call that hidden fees the clerk mentioned our free wifi gym access etc but its not free if there is an invoice charged to your credit card upon checkout;4
this is a big beautiful old building located steps from penn station and times square hundreds of dining and entertainment options right outside the front door we had a child with us so shamagne the wonderful front desk attendant checked with the manager and offered us an upgraded room to accommodate the crib which was promptly wheeled in to our room a few minutes later big thanks the shamagne for that as even the larger room was pretty small lifesaver the lobby and common areas are beautiful our floor was recently renovated so it was very clean and up to date our experience was great;4
efficient late check in great size rooms clean tidy and bed comfortable bathroom a bit of a tight squeeze and shower dripped all night but expensive comforted to the hilton at the airport which i stayed at a few days later;4
the hotel has a modern design the rooms are clean and tidy the service staff is very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to help with luggage and deliver breakfast the sound insulation effect is also very good especially the mattress is very soft and the pillows are very fluffy;4
room was clean nicebut a bit noisy from street traffic retrieving car via text was frustrating but worked out due to great help from front desk staff left an item in room on checkoutrecovered due to extra effort by rosie of housekeeping overall a good experience;4
we loved our stay at the new yorker the staff were friendly and the hotel is very centrally located it was aprox 10min walk to time square and 3 min walk to main subway lines the rooms were small but clean we didnt really need a big room anyway since we spent most of our time out on the town i highly recommend a stay here and would stay here again;4
first off i have to say after reading some really terrible reviews on this hotel i was scared of what to expect when wed get there but to my surprise everything went smoothly we arrived on a monday check in says 3pm and we got there around 1230 so we were worried that wed have to walk around and waste time until we could check in maggie at the front desk let us know that our room was ready for us and she was super nice all the staff were from the door men to the reception to the concierge our room was a standard queen room nothing special nor was it really big but hey its new york you cant expect to get a huge room i loved the decor of the room and the overall hotel very trending the room was kept very clean thanks to the wonderful housekeeping;4
this is one of those times a failure leads to a happy ending i had an apartment reserved through airbnb months in advance and when i arrived i was told i could not stay there as i sat in the lobby wondering what im going to do i remembered the name of the hotel my friends booked into i called the empire hotel and was able to get reservations for 5 nights call the hotel directly when i arrived i was thrilled to see the location literally across the street from lincoln center dante park one block to the subway and a few blocks from central park there are many restaurants in the area a drugstore around the corner fresh fruit vendor really anything youd want its not a bargain situation but its wonderful the empire is a classic hotel with a nice bar;4
my family and i decided to spend 5 nights sunthurs in la before our son went back to school we found the hotel on the web and chose it based on availabilityprice and locationas we planned two days at universal studios we called ahead and asked for a room on a upper floor and facing the court yard we did get upper floor 2ndbut not facing the courtyard we had the deluxe room 254 this is the back corner across from the ticket taker before leaving the parking lot we paid for our reservation in advance and were told we were going to have to leave a 100 deposit that would be returned when we check out but when we checked out we were told that it was just a credit hold and nothing was charged we were charged for parking at 22 a day plus another 2 tax we;4
we really enjoyed staying at this hotel the custom omelettes and made to order eggs and waffles make this hotel a real bargain its location near the santamonica metro line weekly pass 20 made travel to hollywood universal and disneyland via the metrolink or amtrack from union station almost free the rooms are a good size and the beds very comfortable there is not much in the immediate neighborhood there is a rite aid and minimall nearby but with the transit so convenient i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to leave their car at home one downside is the showers it takes a lot of effort to activate the shower head by pulling it away from its socket;4
super clean great service and nice decoratedclose to everything i think it was a good choice rooms are not so big but for 2 people it is comfortable i will come back for sure no coffee machine at the room this will be a plus if they get one for the roomsð;4
your typical ny hotel the usp of this place is its location closer to penn stationmacys and other touristy stops the rooms are typical ny small but functional the bathroom was well appointed the gym is particularly great as a place to spend few nights in ny this is as good as any out there;4
all you have to do is walk down the hotel driveway and over a bridge and you are at universal studios universal city walk we parked in the underneath car garage this hotel is big and it is always busy with lots of people coming and going we had a nice large room with a view of la and 2 comfortable queen beds for our family of 3 for some reason the temperature gauge in the room read 68f but it still got a little warm overnight which doesnt make sense our room had a clean big bathroom only one luggage rack in the room for 3 of us no breakfast was included in our stay we used the checkin app on our phone to check into this hotel but for some reason it didnt give us access to the pool area so we had to go and get a real room key from the reception after;4
we stayed 5 nights in may 2019 nice room clean and just the right size newly renovated great location i recommend this hotel and will stay there again next time in nyc central park and the lincoln center are nearby as well as many restaurants;4
we usually visit friends in the city but decided to stay here for its central location and ease of access to penn station the location for those travelling in and out of port authority penn station or one one of the midtown bus stops is pretty amazing we were just a short walk from our bus stop the hotel is very historic which was the dealmaker for us on this property vs others in midtown the lobby is a beautiful art deco one and the bottom floor with the fitness center has a mini museum on the hotel the hotel has been renovated and while its very old thats part of the charm winding hallways old elevators etc the room we had was small but all we really needed was a place to sleep and shower for a longer visit it may have been close quarters even though we;4
i stayed here 2 nights in december 2011 the location is great best attraction 2 short blocks from central park for great morning runs the room deluxe king i think that this means a standard room was postagestamp sized not enough room to actually stand in front of the sink you sort of have to straddle the commode to wash your face and predictable toestubs on the bed if you try to walk from one side of the room to the other i was on the second floor and predictably there was street noise through the night hint run the air conditioner to add some white noise and drown out the street ill also never understand why hotels have shower stall with no doors so that they can count on flooded bathroom floors every morning in every room but the desk staff were;4
i read a lot of reviews here before booking this hotel that said it was in an unsafe or shady neighbourhood it may not be in the most lively areas of la but its definitely safe there are some big hospitals in the area so there are always lots of cops around ive walked around late in the night as well and there were no problems youll have to travel a bit to visit the sight seeing areas but the hotel is very close to the metro station so its very convenient and while it isnt quite in hollywood its close enough and also quite close to downtown coming to the hotel my room was quite clean and quiet with a nice view of the courtyard the hotel does have a peculiar smell though not exactly a bad odour but youll definitely notice it even if it wont bother you much;4
the empire is a stylishly decorated hotel with a friendly and welcoming staff rooms are a reasonable size for nyc and clean the bathroom in our double bed room was very small which was not a problem for me but something to take into consideration if its important to you the location of the hotel is safe and relatively quiet and is convenient for guests visiting lincoln center right across the street or central park it has great access to the subway for visits to other parts of manhattan especially destinations on the upper west side like the cloisters the museum of natural history and columbia university the area around nearby columbus circle has shopping restaurants and a busy whole foods good option for breakfast the only thing that marred our stay at;4
we stayed for 5 days and we had no problems at all we were travelling with two kids 5 and 10 years and they were very happy about the pool we also foundation the breakfast very very good with a good service we wouldnt mind coming back;4
staff are efficient and very accommodating happened to stay during fashion week crazy busy but did not feel inconvenienced in any way rooms are nice however difficult to manage the temp in the room;4
staff was helpful and courteous my room was cleaned daily and had no cleanliness concerns great italian restaurant at the hotel the tick tock diner was just ok and service could be better but a plus that its open 247 and one doesnt have to go outside the hotel for a late bite liked the hotels proximity to subway lines and easy walking distance to other city amenities without the craziness of times square area would definitely recommend to others and will price it out on my next personal trip;4
location is perfect second stay it was beautiful after christmas and staff very helpful free wifi and safe no tea making facilities bathroom has baths located next to train station and 2 minutes from macys great for tourists;4
stayed in better hotels and stayed in much worse this is a well used hotel and is clean tidy and does what you need to it to do it lacks lounge areas and good restaurants but is definitely suitable as a base to enjoy nyc the value for money is very good and the staff are helpful;4
my wife and i spent 5 nights at hotel ameritania for our trip to new york it is excellently located close to times square making many of the cityâs attractions especially the theatre district within easy walking distance initially we were booked into a nondescript room on the 3rd floor but the pleasant hotel receptionist readily agreed to move us to a bigger streetfacing room on the 11th floor after the first night the higher up the room the more you leave the noise of the street behind the better to help you sleep we didnât avail ourselves of any other of the hotelâs facilities like the gym bar breakfast too expensive at 20 per person or wifi again too expensive at 9 per day we likewise avoided the expensive minibar provided in our room our eventual;4
this trip hotel was not up to my standards room was very small and in need of repairs especially in the bathroom on several of my stays rooms were excellent as well as service i was disappointed;4
the hotel is stylish a little too stylish if you ask me the patterns on wallpaper and carpet could make you dizzythe bar area is neat my room was a decent size and had a nice table to work at great location especially if you have things to do in the columbus circle or lincoln center area very close to subway;4
stayed here a few days while enjoying the city its a good location very close to central park starbucks right on the corner places to shop and eat a few blocks away staff was courteous and helpful its probably on the edge of needing a good remodel though room had a bit of a musty smell;4
we booked the hotel via bookingcom for 7 nights we selected this hotel for its location in new york port authority bus station 5 minute walk penn station directly across from the hotel by train to washington and empire statemacystime square all within easy walking distance hotel art deco style check in good and fast room was a queen room on the twentith floor and on the small side the room was clean and had fresh towels every day the room service staff did an excellent job keeping the room clean and was always friendly and politethe bathroom was a disappointment with the fixtures and fittings requiring urgent replacementsecurity in hotel was good everyone having to show room key before accessing the elevators bonus feature for us was luggage feature;4
arrived june 2 about 130 pm and the room was ready we were thrilled we could put our belongings into the room as we had a 330 time for the 911 memorial the empire is located about a block from the 1 subway which took no time at all to get to the financial district rector street exit the drain is the bathroom was not working we mentioned to a very pleasant housekeeper and front desk it was completely fixed when we arrived back to the room later we had a lovely room 2nd floor 2 double beds and a love seat for 3 women which was perfect and very quite the love seat wound up perfect for one in our group she is very petite and made her nest there for the night prior to check in i filled out the room request that was emailed to me which i had asked for an extra robe;4
chose to stay on the west side of the park for the first of many visits and found this location wonderful our double room overlooked lincoln centre the room was a great size the beds comfortable but overall it could use some sprucing especially in the bathroom grab a caulking gun and order some new towels loved the size of the closet and lots of places to put shopping bags the lobby was dingy to me it is dark to accommodate a bar but that jungle theme needs to be freshened up i found the little sofas for four were occupied by what looks like sloths slouching around on their phones looking for free wifi come on empire throw it in and get the slugs out of the lobby and off the floors the staff are great at the front desk and the cleaners great attitudes and;4
convenient location you get to the hotel from the airport by a shuttle that leaves approximately every 10 minutes 5 minutes transfer vast lobby quite efficient checkin we had dayrooms so that we could sleep 56 hours between two long flights nice and large bedrooms clean comfortable beds acceptable bathroom soundproof windows you hear absolutely nothing from the airport you hear some mutad sounds from the corridor we couldnt get the free wifi to function we didnt have any meals or visit the fitness centre;4
in the heart of tourist area which is very convenient lovely big rooms would be nice to have a kitchenette to make it perfect check in staff were very efficient despite there being lots of people checking in at the same time;4
we stayed at the hilton for our last three days in california so that we could visit universal studios check in was smooth and the staff very friendly the hilton is quite close a 200 metre walk away and our room overlooked the studios the room was more than comfy and quite large and spotless i cannot understand why you cannot seem to get milk in the usa at hotels anymore and generally everyone is quite stingy with the coffee allocation the hilton was no exception we dined at the restaraunt on several ocassions and specifically for the seafood buffet the food and choices were good but i thought the price was a little high the ambience of the hotel was quite good and relaxing i made the choice of getting the valet parking for the extra 5 per night for a total of;4
we enjoyed our stay at the empire hotel adbelah at the front desk went above and beyond to ensure that we had all the amenities and services that we asked for really appreciated abdelahâs customer service;4
stayed here for 4 days with my teenagers check in 4pm it gets really crowded can check in early for additional fee breakfast buffet is ok nothing special the waitstaff seems a bit odd if your kids just want omelette then pls dont buy the buffet for 28 its a waste notice that they push u to go to buffet ðð½ breakfast ends 30 the room is decent size for 400night a kingsize bed queen size sofa bed housekeeping is great clean lots if towel fast pool is small like for kids only staff are friendlyð location is a 10 min shuttle ride to universal studios perfect place to stay elevator is better thn 2 years ago attendants are super nice welcoming minus 1 star no wifi you pay 8 for 24 hours it sucks;4
good rooms regular breakfast food a bit expensive spent the christmas even there with great quality of food served properly parking area very good but the daily price a bit expensive quality of breakfast was great but the price a bit bitter;4
the hotel and room had everything we needed with the only downside being no free wifi in the rooms i think the hotel made up for this by providing free wifi in the lobby and including free coffee and water the hotel is in a great location just a stones throw away from times square the room albeit a little small was still very nice and clean and given that we were only ever in the room to sleep the size didnt bother us too much at all overall we had a really good stay at ameritania and would not hesitate in staying again a special mention also needs to go out to jeff on the door he was extremely pleasant from when we first arrived and was always happy to assist us hes a credit to the hotel;4
entering the hotel you immediately walk into an art deco lobby where you are greeted warmly by various people check in itself was easy and informative our room was a decent size up on the 27th floor offering incredible views the room was clean and well looked after daily we enjoyed breakfasts at the tick tock diner also excellent and the hotel was in easy reach of all the sights or transport to them would definitely recommend;4
i stayed here 2 different times during sept 2019 it was convenient and not too far from my daughters hotel who was a contestant on agt the staff are very friendly my only issue was the not having access to a microwave unless i paid 25 i had asked to warm some food up but the concierge said there was no way unless i rented the microwave this was the morning of my checkout the restaurant breakfast was really good the bartenders were super nice and made great drinks i wish id written down their names i was too late for the kitchen but he put together just some warm bread with a few spreads for me to snack on while at the bar i especially want to mention joel upon learning that we were there for my daughter and nephew whom were apart of the choir competing on;4
the place is festive on the eyes its very inviting my only disappointment was that the heat wasnt working in the room we booked we were transferred to another it was a cozy setting i would recommend it to family friends;4
hotel charged usd85 for early checkin to a long term hyatt member should have been usd0 or no more than usd25 complete ripoff that undermined and otherwise great experience online booking agent didnt know that a shuttle service picks up from international terminal;4
best among the positives is its location being nearby central park and the lincoln center and columbus circle i attended the nyc marathon last sunday and this is the nearest hotel you can find just a block from the finish line accommodation was good bed and pillows were nice place was clean bathroom was adequate in size just downstairs is the convenient duane reader and starbucks would book there again for next yearâs marathon;4
a grand hotel from the 1930s with friendly helpful staff we stayed in a basic room with queen size bed which was clean and tidy if a bit tired in decor disappointed that having paid hotel as part of package including taxes we were then charged 10 per day for access to wi fi and the gym both of which are advertised as amenities on their website this might now be standard practice for hotels in usa but not something we have encountered before we used the hotel bistro and trattoria which were good we used the airport shuttle service from jfk which took about an hour and half in heavy traffic later learned that we could have used the monorail to jamaica then train to madison square garden which only takes about half an hour;4
the hotel and room sizes and shared bathrooms were exactly as promised so it would be silly to comment on sizes but the amenities the cafe the club downstairs the service the lobby are all more than i ever expected;4
my daughter and i shared a room on the 4th floor with two double beds our room faced a courtyard so we kept the room darkening shade down most of the time but at least that meant we didnât have street noise we slept quite well except for the first night when the alarm clock set by a previous guest started blaring we were surprised to discover that the refrigerator had a lock on it but thankfully the front desk sent someone up to unlock it also the tv didnât work so the front desk sent someone else up and they reset it the room was very small but the bathroom with a rain shower was fine the ameritania staff was very kind and helpful it was nice to have cold water in the lobby;4
we enjoyed our stay here the pros the location was wonderful out of the hustle bustle of major crowds but still close to plenty of activities lincoln center columbus circle central park and very convenient to a metro station for quick access to the rest of the city the staff was super friendly and helpful everyone we encountered was cheerful and kind the lobby is lovely and both the lobby bar and the roof top bar were fun loved that there was a coffee shop and a drug store around the corner the cons the rooms are small and show a little wear the very small bathroom was a little problematic when i was trying to do my make up and hair as there was quite literally zero counter space in our bathroom and i wished for some closet space to stash our stuff out of the;4
the hilton was a great place to stay it is a 5 minute walk to universal studios and city walk which is a food and retail complex next door to the studios it is in a clean neat and tidy area at the bottom of the hill is the metro which goes everywhere and is 175 per single trip whether you travel one tube stop or to the furthest station walking down the hill from the hilton is easy to come back up there is a complimentary shuttle our room was large clean and very well equipped cleaned bed made and restocked with towels toiletries and coffee everyday comfortable bed changed every 3rd day iron hairdryer fridge we recommend this hotel and location;4
hotel was clean inviting lovely queen room was kinda small but well stocked clean and comfortable since we werent spending too much time in the room anyway excellent location close to the park and a lot of shopping and restaurants although not entirely intolerable the heatingcooling system level of noise that other reviewers have mentioned is definitely true i slept through most of it but it was definitely noticable and noisy when awake i stayed here because of having seen the show gossipgirl worth the experience would consider staying here again but there are so many places in the city to see that it wasnt so spectacular i would stay here every time;4
a beautiful hotel but our room was too small there was 2 of us and no room for 2 suitcases but it was clean and beds were comfortable bathroom a bit out dated and tiny just too small for 2 people they said we couldnt upgrade no rooms available staff were all nice great location also our room had no coffee pot so they did get us one but then the maids never gave us any more coffee or cups and we slept there for 4 nights starbucks across the street however but always nice to have a cup when you get up ð;4
service was great friendly and accommodating we had to get up at 6am for a trip and they specially got up and prepared breakfast the room a bit small but cozy and nicely furnished close to the 1001 night experience the roof was cool too it was just a bit to cold february to enjoy it the biggest drawback is the location its behind a few dark alleys and the first 2 times we had serious trouble finding our way backmy girlfriend never really felt very comfortable walking back there at night not that it was ever a problem but just i just wanted to mention it its about 10min walk to the main plaza in general we had a great time there and i would go again if you are more of an fearful type its maybe not for you;4
they were very kind to upgrade my room to a suite because they had the availability the room was massive and not just for nyc in general it was extremely spacious the view of lincoln centre was beautiful normally i get a view of another brick wall while in nyc my main complaint was waiting a full 15 minutes for the elevator to arrive i was bringing my luggage down so i could not take the stairs someone was waiting for me downstairs and we were texting back and forth in disbelief of how long i was waiting i booked this trip on points so it was a very nice treat but if i was paying out of pocket its a pretty high price tag;4
we spent two nights in a club level room while attending a dodger game and spending a day at universal studios our room was large with a wonderful view the staff were helpful and kind the location is perfect for the amusement park and other la activities we were very disappointed in the breakfast onsite we had passes for the breakfast and chose to upgrade to the full buffet the omelet chef was not available for almost 10 minutes and then the egg dishes had a strange taste we chose not to eat at the hotel the second morning we enjoyed our stay and would return again for a trip to universal;4
the rooftop is incredible it was like being in holidays from there you cannot imagine being in big apple i really like the upper west side area it is a 10 minutes drive from times square and just next to central park 5 minutes walk;4
during the height of the pandemic a sanitized indicator is placed across the door and door jam this tells the arriving guest that the last individuals cleaned and certified that the room is ready for the receiving guests if there is no stickers a red flag should go up you can only know this if you stayed at a previous hilton properties;4
this hotel was part of a ba package and chosen mainly for the location not expecting much as have been to ny before and found hotels small and showing their age was pleasantly surprised to find a good sized room for 3 of us and a tired but perfectly serviceable bathroom asked for hot drink machine and this was delivered within 30 minutes all phone calls and wifi free diner in hotel was good and reasonable value opposite penn station with the lirr to jfk we had a corner room on the 29th and it was very quiet;4
quick check in rooms are quite small but as you wont be spending a lot of time in the room it isnt really a problem clean rooms but they are in need of an update no kettle in room i would have packed take a travel kettle had i known paid a room levy when we booked in this covers wi fi in room lobby i found out phone calls were free of charge on our last day check with reception regarding long distance international charges ticktock restaurant in hotel very handy for quick bites to eat;4
the lobby of the hotel was nicely decorated with art deco the staff was friendly and worked to solve problems the rooms were nice but small the location was great and you could see the empire state building from the hotel and madison square garden is basically across the street the subway is just outside of the building so its very convenient to get where you want;4
this must be the best located hotel in new york everything on your doorstep even mcdonalds directly across the road the rooms are not huge but they are by no means tiny full bathroom with a great shower felt like a power shower rooms spotlessly clean staff helpful and we had a double aspect room with a view of the empire state building and madison square garden we were able to walk from the hotel to times square central park roosevelt centre 5 avenue etc we travelled from jfk by air train and subway and arrived right on the side of the hotel so easy and only seven dollars each;4
just back from 4 days staying at the new yorker had requested an accessible room via travel agent however this information was not passed to the hotel explained requirements to reception and the girl changed our room and gave us an early check in fantastic great room spotless with loads of room for all the shopping brilliant location hotel is across the road from penn station and madison square garden couple streets from macys and empire state building would recommend this hotel and definitely stay there next time we are in nyc ð½â¤ï¸;4

booked this hotel to be on site for universal studios perfect location just a short walk it also turned out to be the perfect location for touring los angeles very close to freeway so everything was easy to get to hotel itself is a little dated but very comfortable pool area nice but needs more loungers;4
i adored their housekeeping staff rodney he was very attentive to detail and even was kind enough to offer me more of their amenities room service was a bit slow though but the food was also great in quality;4
spacious room comfortable bed and king size one of the most functional showers found around the world stunning location between central park and the broadway theaters friendly and helpful staff thanks to jeff for his sympathy and professionalism;4
better than expected excellent value and great neighborhood rooms were recently remodeled and extremely comfortable only negative aspect was the elevator situation some out of order others slow and definitely crowded you will wait or its the stairs this hotel will be my new go to spot in nyc;4
the hotel best selling point is its location 1 block from macys across the street from msg and a 15 minute walk to empire state building we had no issues with the staff they were always polite we were offered an upgrade and negotiated a better deal for the 8 nights we stayed our room was on 31st floor it was a good size had room and even a fridge the view of the empire state building was fab the bathroom it definitely needs a makeover it was dated and not great the biggest issue is their facilityresort fees of 31 a day its a complete and utter rip off how the state is allowing hotels to charge these fees is beyond me for the fee you get use of the business centre gym and their free wifi shocking;4
we were very excited about our trip and everything was great the hotel location is excellent with subway stations nearby there are delis starbucks and drugstores within a short walk you can also fins good restaurante in the ã¡rea looking forward to coming back;4
the highs were high and the lows were low and there were definitely more highs than lows the upper west side felt like a cozy blanket of nyc we traveled with a toddler and the playground scene was great there is an awesome toddler playground at the 69th street entrance to c park food near empire hotel is excellent i want to give special thanks to the housekeeping with a toddler in the room we were living hard like blueberries in the beds every day and housekeeping was on the ball every time we came back to the room it seemed we had fresh sheets and tightly made beds lows i booked the room because it came with a refrigerator because i need somewhere to put my toddlers milk and snacks and i was horrified to find that the refrigerator was filled to the gills with;4
great hotel staff could stand to improve their customer attitude great beds and linen really nice shampoo and soaps were unexpected had hoped to have drinks in the inner courtyard but the bar was never open maybe in the summer;4
beautiful hotel located in a great location close to lincoln center columbus circle and central park connected very well with public transport what a pity that technological system that made noise all night long;4
we stayed at the hilton universal having stayed there before it is the closest hotel to universal an easy 10 min walk away there is also a shuttle the only complaint we would have is the slowness of the check in staff not just for us but everyone it seems there is no express here they really need to improve their service and streamline check in it also took 30 mins for the bellboy to collect our bags on checkout the pool is a decent size but is in need of repair and the hot tub is even worse this hotel needs some tlc in some places whilst others appear to have been recently refurbished we were on the executive floor and this was in very good condition the breakfast buffet is very good with excellent varietywe would definitely stay here again;4
without the kids in tow we were spending a day at universal hotel is immediately adjacent to the park entrance it is quicker to walk than take the courtesy shuttle large shiny hotel you wonât miss it underground parking with lots of elevators to the lobby checking was a breeze helpful polite staff and a smooth process we had a corner room on the 14th floor stunning view towards burbank everything worked everything was pretty new or recently refurbished apart from the coffee machine which the staff replaced in about 5 minutes once notified shower pressure could be a little higher though the hotel gets a five but after a meal in the restaurant i feel i have to give a 4 overall cool food lacking flavor was presented in fairness once pointed out the;4
the overall experience was rewarding and relaxing i suggest that shower essentials are included within the room upon checking in because mine were not delivered when requested so i essentially missed my shower due to early check out in order to catch a flight the airport transportation was highly efficient and convenient the walls are notably thin and adjoining room noise like snoring can be easily heard thankfully i had ear plugs so i was able to sleep soundly the entire facility including the room is welcoming and beautiful in appearance;4
the location of the hotel is good 1 block from the 96th metro station the hotel is clean the accommodations are ok it is also close to the central park there are many options for breakfast and dinner around;4
location great across from penn station food great breakfast lunch dinner very tasty service great courteous and kind and very helpful i would stay here again if i was to come back time square close;4
after reading a good share of the reviews both negative and positive it felt like a leap of faith booking this hotel the negative reviews commented on the cleanliness of the room service and being overpriced with hesitation i clicked on book we flew in on an overnighter and spent as much time as we could exploring griffith park and the la brea tar pits before heading up to universal city we arrived to the hotel around 1230 and there was a line of guests waiting to check in diana registered us to our room and she was so welcoming and treated us as if we were the first guest she was checking in however she informed us that a huge convention checked in just hours before we got there you would never have guessed if you saw the front desk staff calm and as pleasant as;4
we arranged airport pick up and return for 20 euros the riad is unreachable by car and this is where the problems developed as the area is on the outskirts of the medina in an area where the locals can be quite intimidating to say the least we were constantly pestered by men wanting to show us the way even when we werent lost and always wanted money one demanded money even though he had done nothing to help us and when we offered him a euro to get rid of him he demanded more one small boy tried to take the wallet from my pocket to go out in evening you need a member of staff to escort you to sidi ben slimane where you get the taxis sometimes the street lights go out and then you are potentially in big trouble the riad itself is a sanctuary away from the unpleasant;4
if im looking to stay right near hollywood this is my first choice with a car its easy to get in and out of ive had really nice rooms with good views especially of hollywood if i want i can walk over to city walk for drinks or snacks i can walk down or take the shuttle to the bottom of the hill where the subway is and take that into the city and its not the theme park that attracts me when ive stayed here ive never gone into universal studios;4
i got a top deal on this hotel 9 nights for 500 dollars i took the risk and booked it i was quite nervous about staying at this hotel as i always read the reviews im really thankful for the bad reviews as i was prepared to sleep in a dirty hole we brought two pillows and lots of earplugs better save than sorry as we arrived the staff was very nice and helpful the first ride on the elevator was quite the challenge as we had to fit in it with three big bags yes the elevator is tiny but it was the perfect workout to go up and down the stairs every day didnt bother us the room wos tiny and cozy it was totally clean i began searching for dirt didnt find anything the bathroom was renovated no broken tiles and very clean much better than last years stay at;4
so far it is a good stay and choice if you choose lax as your gateway for departure very convenience location and just next to lax newly renovated design very cool rooms it is good to try next time;4
only draw back was no tea coffee facilities in rooms but available in the lobby jeff the doorman is brilliant very helpful and informative if you need anything ask jeff beds are amazing so comfortable;4
me and a friend was staying four nights at the jane and it was mostly awesome alright its a bit noisy but being in a big city as new york is and considering the price i really cant complain the ac unit however is awful it was very loud and as several said before me it is necessary to have it running even though its minus celsius outside that is also the only thing i really can complain about but if you are walking around in nyc for a whole day even a noisy ac unit cant hold you back sleeping food was great in the cool french cafe downstairs staff was kind and helpful location was awesome we didnt take a cab for any of the attractions nyc had to offer i read you guys was planning to replace the old elevator you have thats a shame since that was probably the;4
i stayed for three nights in a small standard room the staff was friendly and professional the standard room was small but you know that coming in i didnt mind using the communal bathroom was interesting in terms of seeing how different people use the shared space in different ways the hotel does a good job of keeping it clean in spite of the fairly high traffic overall having your own bathroom is of course more comfortable but i didnt mind it esp given the great pricelocation cafe gitane is convenient and has very good food ate there twice during my 3 days there im giving this 4 stars for two reasons first way too much pledge was used in the hallway i was staying in and for some reason the hallway windows were kept only an inch open the smell didnt;4
stayed for 4 nights at the empire in july the hotel is in a fantastic location next to the lincoln center just a short walk to times square and central park lovely little tree filled square right out front to have your fresh bagel and coffee in for breakfast hotel has a fantastic lobby and bar lounge very art deco the rooftop pool and deck is great with amazing views across the city which are particularly outstanding at night rooms are not large by american standards but this is new york rooms comfortable and clean although could benefit from updating our air con was noisy but to so hot in july not able to not have it working staff very helpful and courteous location roof deck and lobby make up for average rooms well worth a try;4
we recently stayed at this hotel and while it might not be in the best part of town i never felt unsafe the hotel is really close to the metro station and bus station giving you instant access to a large part of the city you can easily take the red line to universal studios or the walk of fame or the 704 bus all the way to santa monica pier all for 175 each the hotel itself was clean with very helpful staff the first night we had issues with a crazy lady screaming outside our window but staff promptly moved us to a better quieter room that faces the courtyard breakfast was ample theres even a cook that will make you whatever you want;4
stayed here with my wife and two children for 4 nights over the halloween break lovely hotel staff very courteous and professional especially mohammed at check in the room was very comfortable and cleaned regularly the only slight disappointment was there was no bath only a shower in the ensuite the hotel is in a great location in midtown nearby attractions include times square macys the empire state building madison square gardens the vessel and the highline had a nice dinner in the tick tock diner in the hotelwe will stay here again on our next trip;4
for the money just a great place to stay staff very helpful;4
we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights mid april yes a credut card was asked for at check in but this is soemthing which i experience when i check in at uk hotels now so was not a problem the room was of adequate size with a comfy bed with crisp clean sheets huge pillows private bathroom with plenty of clean linen and complimentary toiletries we had a problem with trying to work out how to use the shower but when we enquired at reception someone came up to our room straight away and got it sorted for us true what previous reviews say about location but once you have got the subway sorted then it is not a problem we had a great view of central park we did not experience the noise which other reviewers have noted the only thing which i did miss not having was a;4
after reading the reviews i will be honest i wasnt looking forward to this stay however on checkin i was greeted by a friendly member of staff who explained how to get to my room etc myself and my friend were situated on the 5th floor and while our room was on the small size it was clean we didnt notice until quite late that the ac wasnt working we forgot to mention to reception the next morning however when we returned we found it had been replaced and been switched on which was a blessing yes we had a shared bathroom and after other people have used it it will be hard to keep clean but everyday we saw housekeeping around on our last day the bathroom was closed which i assumed was for maintenance but we were told where other bathrooms were overall if you are looking;4
check in was quick loved the close position to penn station it was easy to walk or catch the subway to all the tourist spots room was a good size for new york and we had no issues with the hotel great stay;4
this hotel was stunningly beautiful as we walked into the lobby after a 7 hour flight we had a 2 bed 2 room suite to sleep 6 the room was perfectly good and the view was great with one bed having a view of the empire state and the other a view of the chrysler the room was clean but quite tired and could do with a bit of a kick up the bum to bring it to modern day we ate at the diner attached to the hotel for two of the breakfasts the first was excellent and the second was good but the orders came out wrong the diner is quite pricy and a voucher with the room might be a nice touch the hotel was really near penn station but it was not noisy maybe that was just because we were on the 34th floor;4
the room i got was small but it had a view of the hudson as i had requested staff were very friendly and warm especially mohammed the front desk clerk i stayed for 2 nights ate at the tick tock diner and had easy access to penn station amtrak commuter rail and subway madison square garden and the business district centered around 35th and 8th ill be back;4
the hotel is a boutique style friendly staff cozy comfortable and clean no luxury items but good enough for a family vacation breakfast was also very good convenient location that is close to universal studio and downtown la overall i would recommend it;4
the jane is a lovely place and i have stayed there countless times their captains rooms are beautiful and spacious but often overpriced their bunk rooms are tiny but cheap tiny bed and communal bathrooms and a good option if you simply need somewhere to sleep in nyc the neighborhood is the best in nyc in my opinion you have abundant west village charm just outside your door and the river is across the street their restaurant is also adorable and the staff is always kind;4
stayed at the new yorker for 8 days last week and was very surprised with the friendly service i received unlike some other hotels in manhattan in particular a lady names krystal at the front desk was very professional and even wen as far as arranging a room change at a moments notice the only downside to this hotel would be that the rooms are very small other than that very happy with my stay there and would def stay there again thank you krystal and the new yorker team;4
my partner booked us here for a weekend visit to the capital on sat 22214 and was slightly worried after only paying â£40 for a double room too cheap for london she thought however she was soon relieved on arrival very pleasant staff on reception as well as very quick check in no waiting around after a long journey down very clean hallway leading to our room in 119 we were even more relieved when entering the double room to see how pleasant it was very clean and a lovely brightness about the place i was suprised to find a fridge which was very useful for our wine i also appreciated towels being in the room ive never experienced this at other hostels ive stayed in across the continent plenty of plug sockets for phone charging hair dryers and straighteners the;4
after staying around the world trade centre area we stayed here for 2 nights room was clean and comfortable 2 double beds for 2 adults and 1 child location is excellent bit annoying that you have to show your room key everytime you want to use the lifts especially when youre pushing a pram and have bags but understand its a security thing didnt use any of the facilities think there is a gym etc subway was only few minutes walk away as was everything else staff at check in couldnt have been nicer staff at check out however were rude didnt ask did you enjoy your stay or say anything at all just took room key and that was it;4
my boyfriend and i went to nyc on january 8th 2004 for my birthday and we stayed at the quality hotel the staff was quiet but helpful the interior when we walked in was very nice and clean the elevator is very very small the hallways are also pretty tight so if you have large bags you may have to make a trip sideways to your room when we entered our room we were very pleased and surprised the bed was perfectly made the sheets were clean the coffee maker was set up with a pack of coffee on top for us the bathroom was clean but towels werent big enough to dry off with and bring conditioner because there wasnt any in my room the bed was comfortable and big our room was a good size the television was hidden away in a very nice wooden dresserentertainment center;4
we stayed at this hotel in september the hotel is based near madison square ideally located for times square and many other popular tourist spots although we didnt spend much of our time in the hotel we were non stop visiting new york attractions the room was clean and comfortablefresh towels and bedding toiletries were provided staff were very friendly and helpfull the hotel has a history and its decor is art deco worth a visit to the basement to view the photos of past guests muhammad ali was here after one of his fights would highly recommend this hotel to people visiting new york;4
the hotel is in a great location surrounded by stores restaurants and entertainment this hotel was a very nice surprise though the exterior is being renovated seems like most of the city is under repair the interior is quite lovely art deco style very well preserved and maintained from the 1930s our room was updated clean and very comfortable the only negative is the bathroom was rather small also very convenient is a diner with an entrance from the hotel lobby we found the staff to be helpful and friendly as a wyndham rewards member i was quite pleased with this hotel and would definitely return;4
i stayed in this hotel with my brother for four days although the accommodations are quite simple agreeing with the price the hotels staff was extremely friendly and competent everyone constantly asked if we were finding everything all right and were always prompt to help providing extra towels or simply information about the airport shuttle and how to use the metro efficiently the location is really nice because its right in front of central park and also from a two minute walk of a subway station i highly recommend astor on the park to whomever wants to spend sometime in new york city without spending much but having a comfortable place to rest;4
great location services are poor for a 4 hotel lack of consideration to guest arriving with huge time differences not having a proper inroom dinning option beyond 1000pm and restaurant kitchen also closed;4
i enjoyed my stay here i didnât feel that our room was anything special but it was still comfortable and i enjoyed my stay i was able to catch a deal on my rooms also iâm not sure i would have been happy paying the full price i stayed in a single queen bed room and there was almost not enough floor room for my luggage however due to the awesome location great staff and awesome guest area and lobby bar i might consider paying full price when i visit again in the future;4
this hotel is in a great place to visit the north west and downtown parts of la rooms are clean and wellmaintained fitness room equipment is in good order breakfast was well stocked parking is somewhat expensive buffet prices breakfast lunch and dinner seemed a little high but this is a tourist destination the staff are super friendly and helpful would recommend this property to others traveling to la;4
my sister and i just got back from this hotel stayed 1419 dec 04 after reading the reviews on this website we were concerned wed have to find alternative accommodation however we were more than happy the room we had 923 was of a good size comfortably had two double beds and a small bathroom it was very clean new sheets and matresses and the floor was hoovered daily when they also changed our sheets and towels yes the furniture is old but not falling apart and the shower was excellent even if it did drain away a bit slowly for what we paid â£450 inc virgin flights from london for 5 nights we were more than happy not having looked in any of the other rooms i cant disagree with what other people have said but did the bad reviewers stay in the same hotel as;4

overall the empire hotel was very good we had a standard room which although a little on the small side was very clean and well decorated the hotel is well located opposite the lincoln centre and is near to the subway and central park the staff were very helpful and the hotel has a great cocktail bar on the 12th floor;4
we booked via our travel agent we had a room with two double beds which were reasonably comfortable the room decor was good the bathroom was small and a little dated but ok water temperature is strangely set at hot the shower and bath cold taps were closed off we used cold water from the sink poured out of the icebucket into the bath to cool down the hot water the room aircon worked fine and was welcome there are plenty of lifts some go from ground to floor twenty the rest go from floor twenty to upper fortieth floors the 2040 floor lifts broke down one evening which meant a walk up the service stairs from floor twenty to ours on the twenty fifth floor the staff were mostly pleasant we enjoyed using the business centre in the basement to access the;4
an excellent option for a trip to universal studios the staff are friendly and provided excellent service the porter and concierge both showed interest in our enquires and then considered advice we would be happy to recommend the hilton at universal studios;4
i stayed at the hotel with my group for 5 nights the room was comparatively small but the house keeping was perfect although there was no microwave and no fridge in the room i did not miss either as much because we planned to eat out but then there are microwave and fridge in the kitchen in the lower lobby eva is a complement to the hotel she was there to make our stay very comfortable;4
we were recommended this hotel for its location it didnt fail although the rooms were rather small the bathroom a little tired the views completely made up for this i requested a high floor 36th was fab a very busy retro hotel with good facilities tick tock great for breakfast a self serve takeaway for breakfast very handy for breakfast in bed will definitely return;4
just spent 3 nights at the jane hotel and enjoyed every minute of it what a quaint and charming place i have never been treated so well by every member of the staff that i came in contact with the room while tiny was very clean no bed bug problems and quite adequate for my purposes it was truly a fun experience and my fellow travelers felt the same;4
we had an executive alcove room facing universal studio the room was clean the service friendly and efficient the hotel was very busy however we heard no noise when in our room the currents are almost blackout and the bed very comfortable i do not recommend waiting for the shuttle especially if you intend to use the early morning entry at universal it is a quick seven minute walk or a 3 cab to the entrace the primerib and seafood buffet was excellent the only negative was the elevators are very slow;4
the apartmentâs location was great nice neighbourhood a walk to central park lots of nice places to eat a grocery store round corner and express sub way on the door step i was happy with the apartment it was decently sized with good wardrobe space the bathroom is on the compact size but the whole place was very clean and the kitchenette was adequately equipped for our needs things i didnât like paint work was a bit scuffed bringing down first impression you also have to pay for internet service the linen and towels were little worn but clean and fresh and spares provided and the ac was a little noisy but you get used to in and in july you forgive a little noise for a cool retreat i requested my room cleaning on the day before i wanted it at half way thru my;4
im a stand up comedian that was in town doing a gig i have stayed in a lot of hotels and franklyin nyc you have one of the most populated cities in the world the space is limited and its a yearround tourist attraction the room my boyfriend and i stayed in was big for nyc standards the sheets were clean the room was clean we had an alarm clock that worked we had cable in the room it was quietand most importantly the staff was exceptionally friendly the location was a bit of a trek in regards to where the comedy club was carolines in the theatre district but having lived in nyc before it was no big deali just took the subway down to the club in nyc you should expect to walk i would definetely recommend this hotel to friends that want to;4
my daughter and i enjoyed our stay at the jane shared bathrooms and showers were no problem for us the size of our room was a novelty instead of an inconvenience the staff could not have been nicer or more hospitable we arrived in the city on a wed morning and were able to check in upon arrival our bags were stored for us the morning we checked out as we had a few hours to explore before our flight home the front desk staff even called ahead for our transportation to the airport the dã©cor and atmosphere was beautiful we knew ahead of time the ballroom is now a night club we could hear the music in our 4th floor room reading previous reviews i knew to expect it i just turned the tv up we will most definitely stay with jane again;4
quiet rooms and a great location in and out of universal if breaks wanted during the day pool area relaxing and spacious the hotel could invest in new memory mattresses for pull out couches as they are not comfortable if your chid is young and under 50 pounds probably not as noticeable;4
we booked the 2 queen suite they should really update their descriptions and photos as i was a little concerned before we got there that this would not be a suite with a separate bedroom with a door that closes we were happy to see that not only did it have a door that closes but it is actually enormous beds in one room living area with kitchen and conference table in the other if you are a business traveler who does not eat in your room this is perfect but as a family i found this unit challenging no microwave not even on request no dishes utensils any kind of kitchen amenity only a mini fridge and a sink also no laundry in unit and no coin laundry on the property i recognize the hotel wants to uphold a certain image but in reality there are many;4
this is a very serviceable hotel a short distance from the subway and two beautiful parks staff are helpful;4
luxury abounds as you enter the new yorker hotel by wyndham and youre taken back to a time when glitz and glamour were high class and you can see from the marble floors deep mahogany wood and brass trim that at one time the new yorker was on par with some of the swankiest hotels in all the world a real architectural masterpiece these days the hotel lobby is still beautiful they have it tastefully decorated with modern seating albeit too few seats to accommodate the many guests that find themselves stuck there on the floor waiting on there rooms to become ready or a car to pick them up they do have several areas to plug in to power your phone or ipad they have an area to leave your luggage if your room isnt ready and thats helpful so dont think you have to;4
ive stayed at the jane twice now and i absolutely love it the rooms are small but very nice i always stay in one of the captains cabins which has a queen bed and its own private bathroom they have two lovely bars in the back and a cafe though i must report that it has changed since the first time i stayed there and i really miss the old one service at the new cafe is indifferent at best there was a spoken word event in the back room which is lovely and there always seems to be something happening the location could not be better its at jane street and the west side highway right near the new whitney museum and the high line while i miss the manager who was there before hi aj most of the service was good i highly recommend the jane to any friends;4
the location is great especially if you are planning on spending some time at universal studios or city walk you can just walk across the bridge and youre there its pretty awesome the hotel itself could definitely use some work for the price of a room a night you dont get what you pay for the bed and pillows were awesome and i had no problems however the walls are so thin that you can hear everything going on in the rooms next to you and out in the hall so its hard to fall asleep when the room next to you is just getting back or taking a shower my shower didnt even drain properly for over 25000 a night the shower should be draining the customer service was average i saw that this location is a 4 diamond for the past several years but i only;4
this is a welllocated hotelright across the street from lincoln center around the corner from the uptown manhattan part of fordham university including the law school and business school and near central park and good shopping i liked the rooftop barlovely local views i only stayed one night the room was very standard oldschool nyc wellenough appointed and wellenough sizedbut no more the number of open electric sockets was barely adequate oh and the staff kept me waiting for hours for my room to be available i had arrived quite early but the room was not even ready by the normal checkin time nevertheless it was a nice place at which i would stay again;4
weve just got back from a 5 night stay at the ameritania i cant fault the hotel and they looked after us really well it was booked to coincide with my birthday and was also a return visit for my wife we were given a complimentary room upgrade and also a free bottle of wine in the room on my birthday check in was easy and all the staff were very polite the room was more than adequate for a trip to nyc ample bathroom and storage space the bed was also very comfy wifi was available for free in the lobby but is chargeable in the room at a cost of 10 per night my advice would be use the wifi in the lobby and then whilst you are out and about as most places have free wifi the hotel offers a basic buffet style breakfast with limited but satisfactory food selections;4
we arrived here on my 50th birthday and had put in our booking and had e mailed the hotel to ask if it would be possible to have a nice room with a view as it was my actual birthday we arrived early morning as we had been on a cruise the week before and sailed into new york very early morning our room on arrival wasnt ready so we were invited to leave our cases where they would be securely stored in the hotel and told our room would be ready early afternoon we then went out for a few hours sightseeing and returned around 3pm and told our room was ready i expected to have a lovely room and maybe a bottle to celebrate with as i had read previous reviews on here where that had happened unfortunately we got to our room which was really small very dated and no bottle or;4

located near universal studios with paid parking garage lobby is spacious and nice enough but i wont say it is luxurious quick and welcoming checkin process i like that they have a watering station outside the hotelâs gift shop to refill your water bottle and the water is cold and it tastes really good bellman noli is so friendly approachable and helpful in giving information about the area room on the 24th floor is spacious and it has fantastic views of the surrounding area including universal studios comfortable bed and pillows large screen tv small refrigerator spacious bathroom thick towels what else could you ask for we had dinner reservation for their famous saturday evening buffet but upon seeing the restaurant the day before that it has so many tables;4
after a very early start and a long journey from the london we were absolutely exhausted when we arrived the reception staff were extremely friendly and they were able to check us in early which was very much appreciated the hotel is nice and clean as was the room the room was small but from the research i had done this is normal in new york plus we werent planning to spend much time in our room so it didnt bother us the only thing i would say is that the air con was quite loud but it wasnt a huge problem loved the rooftop terrace and pool area lovely views and a perfect place to chill after walking round the city all day the location was perfect for us it was about a 1015 slow walk into time square its right near the lincoln center and 5 mins to the;4
due to the location and a super deal on travel zoo we took a chance on the empire hotel for the 4th of july weeked and we were so glad we did we were upgraded to a junior suite corner room which had a fabulous view of the upper west side and a small view of central park the room was very spacious and well appointed and contrary to all of the reviews that almost scared us away the service was great too we rented a rooftop cabana for the 4th which i definitely reccommend and it came with a small tv chairs and mini fridge that you could stock the bed was beyond comfy and made it difficult to get out of bed in the mornings especially on a rainy sunday the location for us was great as we would not have been happy staying in the times square area too congested;4
2 nd time to n y and loved it just had to come back the hotel is in an ideal spot to get to every thing you need to see subway right outside as well first impression was very cool and retro very clean and friendly staff the room was clean and a good size tv coffee machine not much of a few but no worries the bathroom was small but ok and all worked fine our bed was on the small side for two adults who are not that big so a bit uncomfortable but so tired when we got in after a day in the cold and site seeing it was ok would i stay here again yes i think i would so marks out of 10 we give it a 7 and a half to an 8 thanks for our stay ð¬ð§â¤ï¸ðºð¸;4
we had a group of 8 that i booked for a great rate of 180 per room per night the check in staff were great and made sure all our rooms were close to each other the rooms all large clean and beautiful beds that we all agreed we had a great sleep on we dined in the hotel a couple of timeslovely hospitality great food we all relaxed around the pool which is in a lovely setting with lots of green lawn and plenty of trees and cabanas we chose this hotel based on the fact we wanted to revisit universal studios 5 minute walk and youre there this is a perfect spot for families as its relatively peaceful despite the fact that the excitement of universal is a heartbeat away i cant stress what incredible value this hotel was;4
if you are going to universal for work or play this hotel is perfectly located only reservation i have is that we spent a long time arguing to get a few extra blankets from housekeeping the person in housekeeping kept refusing to give us enough blankets she said her task was to ration them called the front desk a couple of times finally the issue was resolved in all my travels i have never before had someone in housekeeping refuse blankets odd she must have been having a really bad day;4
spent a night at the hotel to get an early flight from lax really great service with every single person we met especially abel at breakfast we had dinner at the 24hrs market ate like if i was at a fancy restaurant yet there were plenty of light options too decor was awesome really chic shuttle service was fast and effective the only reason i did not give 5 stars is because the shower had no water pressure barely water came out and the room wasnt as clean as it could have been but other than that perfect option;4
good location really comfortable and the lobby so nice such as a second home thank you for the good service room was excellent and staff are so friendly best experience at new york breakfast was nice and many types of food to order;4
the decor of this hotel harkens back to a gilded era it is dramatic and glamourous staff are excellent all around concierge very helpful and will book you tickets to whatever you like doormen likewise very polite and friendly always willing to help and were especially speedy and adept at hailing cabs bar serves excellent cocktails we did not make it up to the rooftop bar but i hear its a nice feature rooms are small but i would not describe them as cramped they are stylish excellent showers but do not expect a new building this building has flaws that come with age for me that gives it character they do however need to turn the heat on earlier than nov 1 as the windows are extremely drafty and we were quite cold on several nights in early october cold enough;4
very good location near many hotels that are very expensive since tourist centralybut this hote has nice rooms and amazing staff while being very reasonably priced you probably miss sometimes but worth a look when youre coming to nyc matthew stewart at front desk is excellent;4
stayed here with my wife and two children for 4 nights over the halloween break lovely hotel staff very courteous and professional especially mohammed at check in the room was very comfortable and cleaned regularly the only slight disappointment was there was no bath only a shower in the ensuite the hotel is in a great location in midtown nearby attractions include times square macys the empire state building madison square gardens the vessel and the highline had a nice dinner in the tick tock diner in the hotelwe will stay here again on our next trip;4
i found this through bookingcom it was just a mile away from my sons place once here you really dont need a car if youre a good walker you can get to griffiths park the metro silverlake los feliz and attractions in hollywood easily the breakfast included omelets just watch out for the taxes when looking at the cost i either missed it or it wasnt mentioned when i calculated the total;4
i stayed at the empire hotel for a weekend visit with my two children to see hamilton and enjoy the city the empires location allows for easy access to the subway at columbus circle to get anywhere in the city and right near the hotel is pj clarkes rosa mexicano right around the corner and the rooftop bar in the hotel the junior suite was roomy enough for me and my two adult children was clean and comfortable the hotel was very responsive when the heatier was making a hissing sound an engineer came up to check it out and i received a follow up call to be sure everything was satisfactory i will definitely stay here again;4
staff was helpful and friendly great lobby with good wifi good location 8 blocks south of times square subway entrances on streets either side of the hotel instead of eating breakfast or lunch at tik tok diner adjoining the hotel we liked the bistro cafe short order cook or buffet midblock on 33rd just past lowes movie theater the hotel room doors need pneumatic door closers so they dont slam shut if you want soft kleenex and tp bring your own;4
first of all weve been a bit concerned because of some negative reviews here but all we can say now we cannot confirm them at all weve been in new york city from 0528 until 0406 to celebrate our 10th anniversary and we are so happy to chose empire hotel for our stay the location is perfect central park almost in front of the door two subway stations nearby and not to forget lincoln center directly aside the staff is very kind and helpful our room was available immediately and clean definitely big enough weve also got a real closet the view wasnt stunning backyard but hello youre in new york who needs a perfect view from the room with so many things to see do outside you also wont hear the sound of the air conditioner in the backyard;4
walking into the lobby it looks great very modern looking and we were helped immediately the front desk clerk asked what our visit was for and once she found out it was my husbands birthday and his first time in new york she offered us a bottle of complimentary champagne in our room even though my husband doesnt drink i figured it would at least be great for me once we got on the elevator and made it to our room we could tell the hotel had some remodeling and upgrading to do the room was extremely small from any hotel i have ever been in and there was no refrigerator the view wasnt the greatest either i immediately called the lobby to see if there was an upgrade room or at least one with a refrigerator she told me that they would possibly have a slightly bigger room;4
we stayed there for 2 nights during the february break before heading down to san diego great location short walk to universal studios we stayed on the 22nd floor and had an amazing view of universal studios the rooms were clean no complaints about the staff they were pleasant and helpful breakfast was included in our rate what we didnt realize was that there were two types of breakfast and we wound up paying an extra 10 per person each morning to upgrade to the hot breakfast the only real issue we had was with their new parking system it took 3 trips to the front desk to get it right that was slightly annoying parking was ample and easy otherwise a short drive to hollywood if you want to do some sightseeing;4
i loved this placeeven though standing in the middle of the room i could actually touch the walls on both sides of the room its small but it had all i neededand was only 99i enjoyed walking on the hudson river and the new high line parkits right by it staff excellent friendly helpfulrestaurant excellent food and great atmospheredont know about the larger rooms but mine was small but adequatecharming buildingjust really nice;4
the hotel is about a 10 min walk to universal studios you have to go down the road cross the street and take the bridge or you can take the shuttle which stops first at the sheraton it will drop you off at universal citywalk there is a post by the pickup area that indicates waiting time which is usually about 10 mins the staff was friendly and courteous my husband had a problem with wifi and the tv remote was low on battery but someone was up there in no time to fix the problems the room was spacious with wonderful views of the hillside and the pool the bed was very comfortable and we had a good nights sleep the bathroom was huge and i love that they provide many towels our room was at the corner with only the fire exit across so it was quiet the hotel could;4
i was in the city for 6 days the location of the hotel is fine and the staff are nice however it would be great if they could fix some of the small problems they have for instance the tv wasn t working i am not sure it is just too expensive to fix that in new york also on their website they show stoves and microwaves one would expect some coffee cups or a coffee maker or even since they show a stove and microwave some thing like a pan or a plate hen i inquired they said those were stolen hence no need to have them replaced how about they keep them in the admin office and hand them to whoever need them with an agreement that they will be returned at the end of the stay generally it was a nice stay except those small things that can make a difference;4
this small hotel is the cutest place it made me think of a place i stayed in paris only the morningside inn is 100 times cleaner the bed linen was crispy white and the bathroom linen was white and fluffy its just wonderful for the location and price and the staff really cares what a treat;4
nice tiny rooms with an excellent service at the counter the rooms were equiped with hd tv the service was excellent but the air condition was very loud but necessary in this building the hotel is in a very good spot only 2 minutes from the subway columbus ave only 2 stations away from the times square and directly at the central park so therefore this hotel is an ideal location for jogging in the central park;4
good position if you are going to visit universal studios walk of fame beverly hills and bel air rooms are clean and breakfast is complimentary good quality we stayed two nights no bad noise coming from air conditioning engine or refrigerator parking inside the hotel has a 18 per day charge;4
this hilton is situated just steps from the entrance to universal studios though it is also very close to the freeway and easy to get to other sites in hollywood and los angeles i am a diamond member so i stay at hilton properties almost weekly i do not like paying for parking but it is standard for many fullsize hilton hotels also you will pay for internet as well unless you are a diamond member so i got lucky there although i dont understand why a hampton inn offers free wifi i found the hotel to be clean quiet and with a friendly attentive staff the buffet breakfast is vast and great though not cheap you get what you pay for;4
my brother and i stayed here last month for 6 nightsthis is a basic but nice hotel opposite to central park the room was tiny but cleangood size bathroom concierge very helpful he booked our taxi to the airport the hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhoodthe subway is just a few blocks away and theres a turkish deli just down the road for breakfast they serve food all day the only issue that i had was with the radiatorpipes banging during the nightour last one kept us awake for a few hours apart from thatnice hoteli would recommend it;4
this hotel has been recently remodeled and is artistically pleasing wonderful service esp gisell at the front desk is very helpful there is a fantastic free breakfast avaiable parking is easy all staff are helpful the location is convenient to hollywood sites;4
during my stay at hollywood hotel i got provided excellent customer service by ali he was very friendly and understanding he made me feel very welcomed and was extremely helpful through out my check in which was awesome i would most definitely recommend asking for ali during your check in so your able to get the best customer service overall my stay was great and i did not have to worry about my car since parking is gated;4
we stayed on the 39th floor july 2430 excellent view from our room of the freedom tower comfortable bed although sons said the pull out bed couch and rollaway bed werent that great tvs were flat screen but picture not sharp they also didnt get the yankees or mets games i mean if youre gonna call yourself the new yorker bathroom was fine although the toilet was very lowjust off the ground im 510 avg build and i felt like a giant sitting on it shower was good doorknob on bathroom door would come off i told the housekeeper but it never got fixed biggest financial negative was getting hit with a usd 45 per day âfacilities feeâ on departure i knew about this but it still stinks new yorker said it was to cover wifi gym and business centre the only one;4
aside from above staff were helpful polite and friendly complimentary breakfast and wifi were very useful however unlike other guests who reviewed the hotel parking was charged and this was surprising in america;4
im a big believer in that the person that checks you in at the front desk sets the tone for your hotel stay this was my first time staying at the whyndam new yorker and it will not be my last linda at the front desk was cheerful accommodating and genuine the room was on the smaller side but im used to this in manhattan excellent diner attached to the hotel wonderful neighborhood and happy hour cantina across the street hotel was also very quick to get me a last minute taxi and convince driver to drive me to la guardia even though he stated a couple of times that he only wanted to go to jfk made it to my flight just in time cant wait to be back;4
my wife and i stayed at the empire for july 4th and had a lovely time we enjoyed the convenience of the location and luis especially helped make our stay comfortable and relaxing was easy to get anywhere we wanted to go including to the broadway show that brought us to nyc;4
pil brian and other staff were very accommodating came for a conference and well taken care of the coffee was hot and delicious great location to the childrens hospital my only complaint is the elevators were slow but i used the stairs;4
the staff is accommodating at this lax location i rented a car and had valet service throughout me 3 night stay for in and out conveniences as i attended a wedding in malibu there is a public parking garage for guests to pay by day or hourly adjacent to the hotel staff is extremely helpful and courteous making out stay enjoyable i highly recommend staying at the lax location for the mere fact that it is 5 minutes away from the airport;4
easy inout to the airport shuttle was great unfortunately we were not able to walk to the airport due to construction but as stated the shuttle was very quick and easy team members were all very helpful and kind it was also nice to have housekeeping during a stay again a al precovid;4
to start off with address the elephant that couldnt fit in this room yes the rooms are small if you have a bunk room the suitcases are on top of each other and two people cannot be in the room changing at the same time but you know what i loved it it was a great hotel the front office staff were fantastic except one girl who was there at check in a bit sour we never had to wait for showers there was always hot water and the bathrooms were clean unfortunately we did not find the lobby bar until the last night of our stay but it did look awesome the location was for us anyway as we walked alot during our holiday within walking distance of three subway lines and felt so completely safe walking around at night we were surrounded by fashion good food;4
great hotel big spacious rooms with large bathroom and comfy beds rooms have tea coffee machine iron hair dryer and safe the location to universal is great literally across the road but does restrict you slightly as you are quite far from the city although there is a metro station at the bottom of the hill about a 10 15 minute walk with downtown hollywood only 1 stop away we drove to the hotel there is ample parking i think it was about 16 a night the charge is taken straight from your deposit would definitely recommend this hotel;4
this hotel is busy and despite the amount of people going in and out of it the staff is calm friendly and makes each guest feel special like they are a vip and like they are the only person there we didnt have to wait for anything we were very impressed with this great welcome by the baggage handlers reception security concierge etc everyone was so nice the room was clean and comfortable yes ear plugs help even on the 24th floor because of all the sirens on the streets the location is perfect because it is walking distance to the empire state building time square and the tourist bus routes i highly recommend it;4
after reading the reviews we nearly cancelled so glad we didnt hotel was really good they reduced their price the week before we went an email to the manager and they changed my price to the new one a saving of 45 a night some of the front office staff were not as helpful as others but worked out fine in the end room was clean and tidy with sliding door onto patio breakfast was really good breakfast cereal was nice and fresh waffles freshly made whilst you wait friendly breakfast lady swimming pool area was great with towels supplied water was a bit cold area around the hotel a bit dirty but if you walked up to shops near los feliz about 5 min walk nice thai restaurant with friendly staff supermarket and riteaid easy access to universal;4
great location and beautiful hotel clean rooms and very nice staff dont pay for the in room wifi it doesnt hold a connection lobby and hallways were always very clean and well kept we will visit again;4
we stayed just for one night to see a show at the greek theater and found it absolutely perfect for that purpose the hotel is lovely it has lots of charm character and what is surely the single best free breakfast buffet ive ever had at a hotel its huge omelettes waffles you name it if youre looking for a hotel that is not just a bland generic cookiecutter place try this its nicely landscaped rooms are quite comfortable theres a gift shop a pool we watched the staff interact with foreign tourists found them to be courteous helpful no complaints at all really nice place lovely full of personality;4
nice hotel we were on the 17th floor and had a great view of universal studios only a 5 minute walk over to the park the hotel is very nice we arrived around 1230 i booked online for two beds and when i checked in was told it was a king size i informed them i needed two beds and they changed it without complaint and allowed me to check in early the room was nice and clean comfy beds the window must have had some caulk missing as it whistled from the wind but not too irritating would recommend to my friends we paid 17 a day for parking in addition to room costs i would definitely stay again;4
we stayed at the new yorker for 4 days over thanks giving and were very happy with the hotelthe staff were all friendly and welcoming and we found no queues at reception with a speedy checking in and out process we were given a room on the 26th floor and could see the top of the empire state from our window the lobby and entrance area at the hotel is amazing but the hallways to your rooms are looking tired and are due to be modernized our room was fine and comfortable and large enough again it could do with being updated now but i think thats part of the charm i would stay here again if we returned to nyc as its nearby all the sights including macys and times square;4
pros friendly staff close to lax connected with a reliable shuttle bus cons even though the hotel is new our room showed already wear and tear carpets in hall way was dirty etc windows while double insulated look ugly not to hear views in fact;4
i stayed at the empire recently for a girls weekend in nyc great hotel and would definitely stay there again i have stayed in tons of nyc hotels over the years and used to live in the city so i know what to expect since two of us used to live in nyc and the third friend had been many times we werent really looking for a tourist hotel but rather someplace hip and trendy and it had to have roof top pool that wouldnt completely break the bank the roof top pool was a requirement since it was july and our plan was to chill out during the day and live it up a bit at night there are not a lot of options for a rooftop pool in nyc but this was a total find the location was ideal for our plans and the price was reasonable plus had a great overnight parking deal the;4
this is a very attractive hotel with a beautiful lobby and great location the decor is modern and the finishes and furnishings in the room are very nice the employees are all friendly and offer excellent service the room and bathroom are small as are most hotel rooms in ny however they make up for that with high quality furnishings the clientele were also friendly and polite overall a superb deal for the money;4
my son was sad we didnt have time to use the pool and spend more time around the hotel room service and everything about the roomincluding the shower if you can believe itwere great shoutout to the bell captain who received us and told us all about the propoerty and made us laugh despite the late hour 1030 pm;4
the room was lovely it needed a few touch ups of paint on small scrapes but other than that it was fabulous the beds were firm like i like them there was plenty of room to hang my clothes store my dozens of shoes i brought and storage for my 3 pieces of luggage i loved the fact the flooring was tile the last hotel i stayed at had carpeting that was sticky so to have a nice clean floor was fabulous the cooked to order omelets waffles were awesome everyday the waffle choices changed you could order cinnamon apple plain or banana waffles along with a side of tator tots and sausage a wide variety of cereals juices and pastries were also available there is a nice relaxing patio area that is available if you want to sit and read the pool area was;4
conveniently located close to bus stop metro rail gave us access to all parts of the city the beaches hotel staff were very friendly front desk staff particularly helpful in organising shuttles advising places of interest our clean spacious room was most comfortable we enjoyed the complementary breakfast each day before we headed out sightseeing lovely to avoid the crowded areas prices close to hollywood yet still be able to walk a few blocks to great restaurants in the vermont village the pool is a lovely place to while away any spare time while catching up on laundry in hotel laundry wed be happy to recommend it to other travellers to la to use as a convenient and cost effective base either for a family holiday or as a short stop over;4
this place is a hidden gem far enough away from the hustle of times square but near enough to walk to the hotel styling is excellent and the lobby is a lovely place in which to relax especially the huge fire the staff were all extremely helpful shout out to julian and jeff who were fantastic in seeing to our every need the taxi they organised back to the airport was a god send also want to make a comment about the lovely receptionist who having remembered booking us in managed to reunite my son and his wallet from joes pizza place excellent service the rooms are well designed smart and bijoux with exceptionally comfortable beds great shower and all the amenities you would ever need whilst travelling the umbrella was very useful i would not hesitate;4
stayed for one night in a suite room great value the space was small but comfy enough both beds including sofa bed were comfy great to have individual airconditioning and tv in each room the bathroom was located inside bedroom a little bit inconvenient cleanliness 45 will be better if equipped with a microwave great services and friendly staff received a 2 hr complementary extension on checkout time excellent location for subway and train stations walking distance to many sightseeing tourist places;4
i stayed at hilton los angeles universal city for two nights in july 2012 the hotel is situated between us 101 and the universal studios hollywood theme park with an easy access to both of them i arrived to the hotel after a long flight to lax and was pleased to see no queue at the checkin the person checking me in was courteous and efficient i had booked a king bed alcove room and was given one in the 17th floor the room was quite large with a sofa a large armoire working desk and several side tables bathroom was also a large one with a bathtub everything was spotless the hotel is built in 1983 but it has since been extensively renovated i would guess the rooms had been completely refurbished a couple of years ago even in the 17th floor there was some noise;4
had a good stay with the hotel staff were helpful and friendly especially jeff such a fun and easy going guy if you are ever having a bad day feeling down or feel like talking to someone at the hotel jeff is definitely the guy;4
we stayed here for 9 nights at the end of january and for the price we couldnt have bettered it it is in the same price bracket as shared bathroom accommodation which i have done in new york and would not do again the room we had was large by new york standards with 2 double beds was clean maybe the very edges of the carpet arent vacuumed i dont normally walk on those bits and serviced every day any requests for extra towels or blankets was dealt with quickly and efficiently by no stretch of the imagination is this a luxurious stylish hotel but what do you expect the staff were also all friendly and helpful the location is excellent local shops and excellent diner on 100th st metro diner 1st class breakfast with character service starbucks;4
i stayed at the empire hotel with my best friend earlier this year the location is great right next to the subway which for 3 can take you anywhere in the citybrooklyn central park is literally a 5 minute walk away a little slice of paradise in such a busy city times square was approximately a 15 minute walk away so you still feel really central our room was okay the wallpaper was a little tired in places id advise taking your own waterdrinks as prices were a bit steep 8 for a bottle of water as a traveler outside the us it was frustrating that there was no wifi available in the room you need to go to the loungelobby area otherwise everyone was really friendly and helpful;4
booked empire hotel for a long weekend over new year received warm welcome and headed to our rooms on 6th and 7th floors 4 lifts taking guests to their rooms 1 broken in what i imagine to be their busiest weekend though overall room is what you would expect from new york small and functional decorated thoughtfully inline with the art deco lobby a few downfalls they didnt have a kettle so hot water that didnt taste of weak coffee or tea was out the sink drain cover was missing so you could look right down the plughole was terrified of losing my toothbrush the full length mirror was right in front of the fridge so in order to do your hair you had to use the plugs behind the fridge by stretching your arm around the hot part of the fridge yes i burned my;4
our check in was fast and easy we reserved a king bed but were upgraded to 2 fulls the room and bathroom were clean and well maintained location was excellent easy walk to central park columbus circle shopping times square and the nyc ballet is right across the street would be happy to stay here again;4
not bad at all the bed is very very comfortable and have the tick tick diner in the hall is surely an advantage considering the central position of the hotel and the cost i would recomend it;4
the hotel is very clean professional in a great area the cost was surprisingly good for the location walking distance to the empire state building madison square garden times square the room wasnt large but i was just there to sleep so not an issue there is no pool there is a lot of history to this hotel so go downstairs and check it out there is a restaurant and bar so you can always eat right there if needed i recommend it if you dont care about all the extras you typically dont take advantage of anyway besides a pool haha;4
this is a great hotel for you nyc stay we had a family suite for 4 2 adults 2 teenage kids room as big enough with 2 bathrooms quiet for nyc excellent staff check in and out a breeze i was disappointed with the quality of the fold away bed but it was better than the others we had during our usa holiday location is great easy access to subway short walk to empire state times sq etc we would stay again;4
very happy with my recent stay at the empire hotel check in was easy and they graciously upgraded my room and allowed me to check in before the 3pm usual time very much appreciated i plan to make this my regular business hotel in nyc and have already booked a room for next week hopefully the same room and staff;4
good hotel in the right area of new york right on the edge of times square close to theatres and shopping rooms clean with big bathroom a little too small for two travellers with four pieces of luggage aircon could be better;4
our stay at this hotel was very pleasant our first room was small and the bathroom tiny however everything was clean and comfortable and we are in nyc to experience the city not stay in a room space for toiletries and towels would have made the bathroom nicer the faucet also is just too large to really make the sink work staff was always friendly and wonderful we much appreciated the cheese and fruit tray provided to celebrate my birthday and our 15th anniversary the ac did not work the first night so we were upgraded the following day to a room that was a little larger and the bathroom easier for two to navigate but still lacked space for toiletries and faucet too large for the sink bowl again very clean and comfortable thank you to the staff for all the;4
we stayed there for many nights and we totally loved the hotel it is located very close to the universal studios theme park there is a free shuttle to go there every 1015 minutes or you can walk till there in 5 minutes the hotel is located on a hill so you have the car or you can take another free shuttle from the them park entry or you walk for about 10 minutes the staff is very nice the doormen helped us with the bags the check in was fast and the room was very nice and clean the beds were big and comfy the bathroom was clean and the room was big it had a television quite old model the iron and iron board a free safe the wordrobe and a great view on la the hotel has an outside pool too we went there once and it is very nice you cant bring outside food;4
best location ever 2 steps away from central park times square and basically everthing in manhattan our room was very quiet didnt have a view but it didnt matter because it was very quiet the only minus they charge for internet in the room i would love to be able to stay there all the time;4
this hotel has all the conveniences and comforts for a more than pleasant stay on the upper west side i have stayed at this hotel many times and have never had a problem the staff is very attentive and the lobby bar is a gem;4
we stayed here for a couple of days the nearby subway station made it easy to get into the city our experience was good the area is quiet and has nearby coffee shops we didnt expect much as it was a good value for money;4
the room was tiny but big if you were a tall ship sailor the ship like cabin was cosy adequate clean quiet and cleverly laid out it had all the bells and whistles of a regular hotel room except for a showerbath room the latter was offered just down the hall and was sparkling clean the check in staff was friendly and helpful the early check out staff was efficient i paid 147 for a one bedroom all taxes included the hotel is a short walk tofrom the subway i would stay there again;4
located almost on site to universal studios and walk and its stores taxi from lax c 90100 but the shuttles are chaeper but may take longer in theory you could do it by subway if limited luggage is your the subway is just at the bottom of the hill 10 min walk weekends feel very different to weekdays due to familiesvisitors for the studios bit out of the way if not visiting universal or local burbank area;4
spent 4 nights at the new yorker and we opted for a double metro room with a view great view of the empire state building only downside to this was it was a little noisy with the traffic and the sirens but i expected it in new york rooms were clean and the double metro room was larger than i thought it was going to be the hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to time square and broadway longer walk to central park but was not that far away all the staff were really friendly and very helpful the only disappointment i had with the hotel was the lack of gluten free food available when i asked at the concierge desk on our first night after a long day and we just wanted to eat and rest they indicated that the tick tock diner had options i had;4
nice hotel centrally located loved the overall vibe beautifully decorated thankful for the luggage valet before checkin checkout process was easy the beds were super comfy and the bath amenities were nice a few issues with the building being old eg elevator had some problems operating etc but overall a great stay;4
i had the pleasure of staying in a corner 2nd floor room with a view of the park right across the street nyc isnt as hard nor nearly as expensive as u think astor was pleasantly priced just below a 100s a night for 3nights u dont have to worry about sharing a bathroom like many of the more swankier hotels in nearby manhattan the concierge was very knowledgeable of not just how to get around but also recommended some of the hottest spots in town i like to call him mr rogers as it seemed as tho this part of the city was his neighborhood lol helped make the stay even more pleasant knowing ahead of time where to go and the most costly convient way to get there my bed was a little firm so i think i got the same room as a past ta or tripadvisorlol;4
stayed 3 nights thursday 12th march to 15th nice hotel very friendly staff very welcoming even when we arrived at 130am very clean room and lobby all areas well cleaned daily water bottles replaced each day towels also coffee and tea available at all times hotel in a nice friendly neighbourhood close to bars cafes and supermarkets central park right opposite front door all in all a well regarded 3 star hotel we would stay here again;4
i always stay at empire when in nyc mostly because it is adjacent to lincoln center but also for the kindness and graciousness afforded me by the staff new york can be a scary and sometimes offputting place for an outoftowner but the empire hotel calms the waters and will do their best to make you at home the rooms are neatly appointed with an upscale interior decor comfortable and spotless this has been my experience and to the staff i tip my hat and extend my thanks also know that the empire is full service so all you dining needs can be met without stepping outside but when you do step out there are a variety of fine restaurants in all price ranges to explore as well as the cultural activities of lincoln center and it environs enjoy its fun;4
clean spacious room nice beds good size bathroom minifridge coffee maker great pool area food choices are pricey and the food we ate there was just okgood nothing special they offer valet or selfparking both for a fee parking garage is safe and convenient the pool was great we had it to ourselves for a while but it got crowded in the afternoon and there is a shuttle to get to and from universal and city walk that runs all day that is worth the stay if youre going to universal because you wont need a car we enjoyed our stay at the hilton;4
ive stayed at the empire hotel twice now the first time i stayed here was may 2014 we went back to nyc in february 2016 and decided to stay at the same hotel again mainly due to the location when youre getting around nyc mainly by subway which is how we opt to travel there are a few stations which are preferable to others as they have more linesservices than others columbus circle is one of these stations so the short walk from the hotel to the station is ideal i also think its an iconic building to look at and the area of upper west side is one of my favs in nyc the hotel rooms are compact as youâd expect in nyc they are fully equipped and have everything youâd need from hairdryer to iron to complimentary toiletries from bigalows the towels are always;4
had a 7 night stay in may 2015 and chose due to proximity to central park where we were getting married we initially booked a junior suite but managed to obtain a free upgrade to the king which was very spacious compared to other rooms there was still no free coffee in the room and mini bar was charging 3 a cup and 8 for bottled water the pool bar on the top of the roof gave fantastic views but be warned that a service charge is added to the bill before giving any tip to the bar person the pool is also the size of a large bath there is also a barclub that is accessed via a lift in the hotel entrance open to nonguests of the hotel the location is close to columbus circle subway station where the number 1 train can be caught and there are also plenty of bars and;4
what a great value where else in nyc can you stay for under 200 a night i was skeptical at first but pleasantly surprised we arrived at the jane too early to check in so the bellhop in a classic bellhop uniform held our bags in storage we explored the beautiful lower west side of city the hotel is close to the subway and the staff can get you a cab in minutes cobblestone streets and quaint cafes and restaurants are within walking distance when we checked in our bags were carried up to our room i was again taken aback when i saw the size of the room we had a bunk cabin but it was clean with towels and slippers and a robe to use and we didnt spend much time in the room we were just sleeping there now the shared bathrooms are also something to get used to but;4
i stayed in the new yorker hotel in a queen suite on the 22nd floor with city views from the terrace pros the suite with two connected rooms and two bathrooms gave my family enough space to spread out rooms were very clean and the bedmattress was very comfortable and firm terrace was probably the single best feature of the room with breathtaking city views facing east historic art deco charm and variety of room types location location location close to penn station k town times square subway station on same block good security for hotel guests cons front desk service felt a bit rough around the edges they gave me a hard about holding my luggage until checkin they finally relented however why isnât this a standard service at a 3 star;4
arrived after the most recent dump of snow and a 4 hour flight from toronto there was a queue down the stairs for the basement bar thanfully the security helped me get through with my bags check in was easy and the staffer gave advice that cafe gitane was about to close for the night if i was hoping to grab something the room was as i expected cosy and tiny linens and towels were good quality i loved that robes and slippers were provided though slippers only in one of my rooms i swapped about to a few other room and no suck luck on the slippers should have packed them there was some issues with the heating it went in to overdrive i had the window open the aircon on too they got it fixed the next day the aircon like all aircon ive had in nyc was noisey;4
i was pleasantly surprised with this hotel as i had read some pretty bad reviews about it before i went in november 2012 the hotel for me was more about a nice space to chuck my suitcase and get a nice comfy sleep my check in was prompt and the concierge was very helpful my room standard was a nice space for two and the bed was very comfy my room was located one floor below the rooftop bar when the window was open you could hear the odd group chatting but nothing that kept me up all night the only thing that did make me worry was some of the things they say they charge you for like bath robes umbrellas etc werent in my room when i checked in not that i wanted them but thankfully i was not charged for something i never had overall this hotel is really elegant and;4
my husband and i spent 2 weeks in brooklyn and found a lastminute deal at the empire for approx 180 so we decided to stay in manhattan for one night it was an absolute bargain seeing as the standard room rate is more than double that pros superb location the nearby lincoln center is amazing great lobby area friendly and helpful staff comfortable large beds clean rooms midday checkout cons the rooms are small but hey its new york the bathroom is seriously tiny and a bit grubby im glad we found such a good deal not sure i would be happy to pay 300 for one night;4
this was a great spot to stay my son and i traveled to see a couple of rangers games and the location of the hotel across the road from msg was perfect it is also perfectly located to visit times square the empire state building and central park our room was a tad small considering the price but we didnt spend a lot of time there as we were on the go most of our trip very friendly and accommodating staff we were scheduled to arrive around 3 but ended up there at 1 they found us a room right away and booked us in without charging an early check in fee room was small but very clean the bathroom had an older style tub but everything worked perfectly and again was very clean a top notch experience;4
this was my second stay in this hotel 1st one was about 9 years ago in a tiny room with no view this time there were 4 of us 2 13yr old boys who cannot share a bed due to dangly limbs and myself and my other half we decided on a suite as on of the boys could have the pull out sofa we arrived a little early for check in about 30 mins and were advised to try again in an hour we came back in 2 still not ready very apologetic and gave us vouchers for breakfast the next day we took this opportunity to see if the queues were bad in the empire state building and went there no queue came back to find the room ready nice big living area and 2 small double beds in a separate room we let the boys have them as the pull out bed was bigger and suited us better we slept really;4
this is the third time i stayed at the new yorker i love the art deco architecture the nostalgic and at the same time cosy friendly and homely atmosphere the staff takes care of you seeks to really ensure you have a great stay the location is hard to beat conveniently located near penn station port authority and c line walking distance from downtown and uptown closer to the high line maceys times square madison square garden all just a short walk away the rooms are a decent level of comfort good size beds sufficient space in the room and bathroom;4
first impressions well presented clean hotel stayed from the 7th to the 11th of november 16 and had room 244 on the 2nd floor which was a nice big room best thing about breakfast was your omelettefried eggs or scrambled eggs cooked for you very yummy this tip is for the ladies allow enough time to get ready if you are going to wash your hair as the water pressure is not the best and the hairdryer is not very powerful i had never been to la before and i was a bit disappointed the area is not what i imagined where the hotel is its only 5 minutes to catch a train or a bus which was very convenient we went to universal studios for 2 days its really easy to get there maybe 4 stops on the train then a little walk to catch the shuttle bus up but if you feel fit you can walk;4
3 night stay hardly in hotel beds extremely comfortable rooms are dated however the whole hotel is quirky we had a double double which had 2 bathrooms no kettle though plenty of staff and wasnât aware of any issues we paid our deposit etc by cash as heard there was issues with paying by card good location for penn station and madison sq gardens;4
we stayed in the hotel with 2 adults and 2 teens in a 2 queen size bed room the first night we had a very small room but were then upgraded to a very comfortable room the whole service was great bathroom was ok but the shower power was too strong and couldnt be regulated well unfortunately there was also no fridge in the room wifi was free and sometimes a bit slow beds and room service were good we had a car but valet parking in the hotel was too expensive we found a much cheaper parking garage only 5 min walk away via spotherocom breakfast is served in a diner next to the hotel but there are further opportunities around the hotel the hotel is very central in the city and located next to a subway station all in all we enjoyed our 5 day stay in the hotel and in nyc;4
we are a couple from uk aged 27 and were looking for a great place to stay in nyc we certainly found it i booked this apartment as the prices of hotels in new york are just too expensive i couldnt find anything that looked comparable to these apartments for the money we prefer to spend our money enjoying the sights and eating great food rather than being too picky about the accommodation the reviews from a while back worried me a little but i know that some people can be incredibly picky remember these are apartments not a hotel so the service is more laid back the apartment was fantastic we had a separate kitchen with table and chairs walk in closet with iron and a cute little bathroom clean the bed was a little bit creaky but it was comfy and clean i also;4
i was there on business for a company conference the staff was amazing at every turn very diligent when they saw anyone wandering helping them find exactly what they needed the facilities were great the food was well prepared and quite tasty;4
we stayed for one night on a saturday and booked the splash package which included 2 drink vouchers and continental breakfast for 2 price was good for nyc and for its awesome location our room overlooked lincoln center check in was easy and staff was nice but they didnt go out of their way to explain anything like the vouchers like many other reviews of this hotel the elevators are slow so expect to wait a few minutes our room was on the 6th floor standard queen like i said fine for a night or 2 if you are out and about in the city rooms are tiny be prepared for a small space but it was ok for the time we were there the ac didnt work in our room and i had read reviews of others who had the same issue we told the front desk on our way out for the night;4
the location is fantastic to experience the day and night pulse of ny a very convenient access to mrt columbus stn and the nw of the central park the surrounding restaurants convenient stores and starbucks gave us our daily fill a great stay for a 4night stop in the city that never sleep;4
brilliant location go to lincoln center for shows and central park for walkingbiking they drop prices for the room the day before so if you can wait to book do so the same room i stayed in was 100 cheaper the day before we stayed silly me;4
we had to check in early and nicole was very helpful to finding an open room for us and finding places to eat and things to do as well as rooms were nice and cool and very clean the breakfast was bomb too;4
nice hotel and really trendy nice clean bedrooms which suited our needs located close to central park and a short walk to times square unfortunately when we visited the chowder restaurant was closed but thankfully a load of good restaurants in close proximity;4
i visited this hotel last month and it was nothing but excellent the staff members were very friendly and the location was awesome id recommend to anyone travelling my room had a nice big tv for viewing pleasure and the beds were also very comfortable the hotel really did make it seem as if you were home;4
this is a very stylish riad inside the medina though away from the bustle of the souks we were upgraded to the jasmine suite which enjoys a private roof terrace which could be a real boon in marrakech unfortunately the weather was quite wet so we didnt get to appreciate it in fact the riad has a large roof terrace available to all its guests which would have been a great place to have breakfast on a sunny day the suite is elegant and tastefully furnished though the bathroom is 2 floors down from the bedroom with a day room inbetween the day room is very cute but not particularly useful the staff at the riad are helpful and friendly the guided walk to jemaa el fna the main square when you arrive is very useful after a day the medina and souks are quite easy to navigate;4
we stayed here for a couple of nights and visited universal studios which is only a five or ten minute walk away we were recognised as hilton golds and given a nice room and complimentary breakfast which was very good the hotel itself is reasonably nice as are the rooms when in our room we also couldnt hear any noise from the busy road next to the hotel the staff are pleasant and friendly and were very efficient at check out and check in its a great place to stay if you are visiting universal otherwise there are probably better options;4
great location at my lovely nyc upper west side of manhattan but it was not a great stay and need of renovations its not only with old style furniture and window as so dirty but in everything exept location;4
overall the hyatt was nice for the price the best part about this hotel was that thereâs a shuttle bus that can pick you up from the airport as well as take you back this is a definite plus especially if you do not want to pay for the hassle of trying to get an uber in which can be expensive depending on where you are located it was a little difficult to locate and flag down the shuttle bus driver the driver was not close to the sidewalk area for pick so therefore it was almost as though you would have to run out in the middle of 4 lanes of traffic just to flag them down check in was pretty smooth i was asked did i want housekeeping and what time of the day i would like for this to occur i requested afternoons because i know i would be gone during those times;4
i chose the hotel because of location and cost i read reviews ahead of time and knew what to expect its not a new facility and its pretty bare bones the staff was nice and they carried my bag up for me my original room was on the first floor and when i was checking in i asked about noise level and he put me on the second floor the room was tiny and functional without any frills i arrived in ny before check in and they held my bag with no problem and i checked out before my train departure and they kept the bag again there are muffins to eat throughout the day and coffee and free water for the price i paid it was exactly what i needed the lack of elevator kind of sucks but they put me on the 2nd floor and carried my bag up hauling it back down the stairs was no;4
staff was great hotel and grounds are visually pleasing and rooms are clean wasnt sure what to expect from this hotel given its right next to universal studios but it definitely exceeded expectations we stayed here one night because we had to attend a dinner in hollywood only took about ten minutes to get there so location is great as well a little tucked away and hard to find at first but a great find once you do we are planning to take our kids to universal next year and will definitely stay here the only negative was that they dont police the hallways and we had several large and very loud groups of kids come in late at night if it werent for the lack of sleep caused by those groups id probably go ahead and give it five stars for the experience not a;4
nick at the front desk was great he overheard me surprising my boyfriend of 4 years with a night in the city and he upgraded our room free of charge the rooms were very clean and we had a great view of the park great location at a great price;4
i stayed here in feb of this year and it was great the only issue was many cab drivers did not know where the hotel was so we made sure we had the hotels card on us apart from that it was great free breakfast cooked by hugo was great huge beds great reception staff hollywood boulevard is a couple of stops on the subway and is so cheap;4
stayed at the hotel for two days on business nice location around from the lincoln center there were quite a few nice restaurant selections adjacent to the hotel area and a starbucks right around the corner which were very convenient nice rooftop bar area with a view;4
i feel the hotel should have a complimentary coffee service for hotel guest since nothing is available in the room;4
a sister trip to watch abts misty copeland dance swan lake at the met lincoln center the empire hotel location could not be beat on this occasion special recognition to pasquale a great first impression at front desk checkin he is professional and friendly thank you;4
i was in nyc on business and needed a value location i saw reviews on the jane but i was not sure about it the price was so good i had to try i enjoyed the stay and thought it was an excellent value here are the compromises you have to make for the price 1 share a bathroom i thought this was ok and very clean suggest you bring some slidessandals to go to and from shower shower door closes completely so it is not bad if you need a place to put on makeup it might be an issue my wife would not have put up with it 2 bedroomcabin is very small it is truly like a cruise cabin so you have to be flexible i suggest bringing a few hangers tv and internet access was great but no place to do work except on your lap 3 bed is like a bunkbed mattress if you are;4
stayed at the new yorker for 3 nights before joining a cruise which was subsequently cancelled location was superb great if you like walking as we walked to most of the attractions even the statten island ferry albeit a long way on arrival check in was really quick and efficient with friendly staff we had a problem with the cleanliness of the shower on the first night and crystal was superb in recognising the problem and moved us to a far nicer room next time we would definitely ask for one of the refurbished rooms as the previous room was quite dated we ate in the restaurant one night and the meal was fantastic would definitely return;4
didnâ´t have to wait for bathroom not even once everything was clean staff is great very polite and willing to help the weird thing is that it seems to have a few strange people actually living there iâ´m not sure about but iâ´m guessing because these people were in bedrooms with different locks and they really act like theyâ´re living there for a while anyway it wasnt something that made me feel uncomfortable or anything i really enjoyed i would stay there again for sure;4
the new yorker is a iconic hotel which is directly opposite madison sq garden as well as close to times sq empire state central station and penn station the hotel staff are friendly and helpful but be aware of the compulsory resort fee i was but many are not the rooms are small if having two doubles in there but are adequate the bathrooms are small and tired but clean and functional would i visit again absolutely;4
stayed here for 4 nights at the start of april 22 the hotel is an iconic building in nyc being one of the oldest hotels in the city it is a little dated with its brown decor the room was large and clean and being on a high floor we had great views over the hudson river our main reason for being in nyc was to watch some sport this made the location of the hotel perfect for madison square garden all staff at the hotel were polite and helpful when needed;4
my fiancã© and i took a spring break trip to new york and stayed at this hotel for four days our stay was wonderful the room was clean spacious enough for two people despite being off of a major street broadway it was extremely quiet and we both slept well yes the exterior halls show signs of wear and yes the room has older furniture and carpet but unless youre a spoiled princess as some previous reviewers seem to be its the same level of quality youd expect from a heavily trafficked days inn or motel 6 or similar quality hotel anywhere in the country our only complaint would be that the heater was a bit overactive and not adjustable the only reason im not giving a 5 star review but we werent too hot in the room so it wasnt a big deal hotel staff;4
just ok expensive for location poor wifi one elevator bank out of service very slow draining tub not many channels available on cable;4
ive yet to make this trip but have been booked for july i had a query with regard to the travel from la to san francisco and sent them an email and the response received was fantastic detailing all options of travel thanks to jeff zarrinnam hotel director looking forward to my stay at this hotel and hoping for excellent service letty from western australia;4
i stayed here from 181113251113 i had a comfortable bed had a tv and it was what it said on the website when i asked for my room to be cleaned it was i had a room with shared bathroom i was lucky as the other people who used the bathroom were clean i did get woken up a couple of times from people banging their doors and i spoke with them and it stopped when i wanted something from front desk i got it i could have guessed back as i had friends staying at another hotel who came to visit me and had no hassle getting them into the hotel for a hotel on a budget it is well worth a stay their is a kfc macdonalds near the hotel and other local delis there is a starbucks right by the tube stop which was very useful i used 110th cathedral parkway on line 1 to get;4
i have stayed at the days many times with no regrets friendly staff baggage storage for late departures or early arrivals sufficient room space half a block to 96th st subway 2 stops to times square;4
great location just across the columbus avenue from lincoln center metropolitan opera near two metro stations lincoln center red line 1 and columbus circle blue line ac and orange bd easily accessible from jfk airport central park is one block from the hotel zoo or the museum of natural history are in 15minute leisurely pace very convenient location for the participants of new york city maraphon just five minutes from the finish to the hotel great staff excellent housekeeping good coffee machine good wifi but noisy you can hear whats going on in the next room you can only pray for quiet neighbors but sometimes it does not help my room was on the 4th floor with a window on the broadway and at night the noise of passing cars hindered sleep;4
great location good clean rooms really comfy beds need after twelve hours on your feet good choice of breakfast in the adjoining tick tick diner would stay here again if i was lucky enough to very central for the sights and the subway;4
this is a clean hotel with friendly professional staff yes it is somewhat in need of updating but i was only there to sleep i needed a reasonable place to stay that was near mt sinai hospital and this was my choice i wasnt there to vacation i wasnt there to inspect the property i was there to get a good nights sleep and i got that there is a laundry within walking distance and there are food establishments open late nearby if you have time to kill take the bus up and down broadway theres plenty to do and see i would stay here again simply because the bed was comfortable the staff was accommodating and i got a good nights sleep ps if the wifi isnt working in your room call the desk they will relocate you to a room where the wifi is stronger;4
if you make up your mind before for tiny rooms and shared bathroom you will find it awesome because except these two everything is excellent from price location staff and cleanliness perfect for solo visitors;4
location is everything so if you want to be near lincoln center and columbus circle this is the spot ive also stayed in the nearby hudson hotel and for me the empire wins small room great bed odd shower stall no door but somehow it works literally steps from 3 restaurants and a starbucks eerily dark lobby for some reason and the elevators are very slow at peak times 43 cab ride from la guardia i wish i had asked for a room with a view when i checked in room 402 faces another building 10 feet away;4
an adequate cosy room for the situation in central new york very convenient to penn station and underground good breakfast facilities with excellent prompt service and choices felt ripped off at daily 25 levy for wifi and health centre i thought racketeering went out with prohibition but it seems standard in most new york hotels helpful and friendly staff and well situated for empire state shops including macys and broadway;4
this was a terrific choice for our stay in la it was close to santa monica hollywood beverly hills and it is across the street from universal studios we had a fabulous breakfast each morning our girls were upgraded to the buffet for free we did the upgrade one day and decided the continental breakfast was so good we would stick with that the rest of the week the beds are so comfortable and the hotel clean the staff was very helpful and friendly the pool area is pretty and our kids had a wonderful time swimming while we relaxed pleased with the hotel and worth the money;4
this hotel is well located near times square broadwaytheater district and central park the rooms are decent sized beds are comfy and bathroom is huge and nice all staff was friendly but no housekeeping due to covidlack of personnel unless over 3 nights stay also there is no breakfastfoodbar available but plenty of options around would stay here again;4
staff was friendly and helpful doormen not available when needed but more than enough 3 at other times great location for walking to park times square or subways entrance located on side street makes easy unloadload for cab and car service;4
on the whole i have to give this a very good rooms are spacious for new york although we did get an upgrade the bathroom was tiny though and very dated the heating took a while to master we ate breakfast daily in the diner downstairs which was good reception staff really pleasant and helpful concierge and door staff were typical new yorkers;4
this was a beautiful hotel and a great location walking distance to just about everything our room was fairly large and comfortable for four people nice amenities the beds are not the most comfortable but not horrible either;4
this hotel provided ear plugs in the bathrooms so there is that the interior is quirky and modern staff was very nice accommodations were comfortable breakfast buffet upstairs is a bust so dont bother;4
you know you are at a hilton rooms were very nice roomy and clean great views nice staff although location is close to universal studios walking to and from is not easy if you are a walker you will probably be fine but if not everyone is andor if you have younger kids walking wont be your best option shuttle comes every 1015 minutes and is a good way to get back and forth the hilton is not cheap but is a very nice hotel buffet is great but very pricey;4
my husband and i stayed here for three nights at the end of our trip after reading some of the reviews we were leary but in general we had a really good experience previous reviews stating that this is not a hotel and to not expect the level of service found at a hotel are correct there is no maid service and the guy at the front desk doesnt work for the yourstay companyso hes not very helpful additionally there is no unloading zone you have to double park or park in a no parking zone however the apt was clean the kitchen equiped with stove small refrig dishes etc the only problem we encountered was the tv didnt work theres an information sheet in the room for contacting the company so we called and reported the problem a guy came up pretty quickly he;4
i stayed at the empire on business i enjoyed the stay everyone was courteous and helpful the roof bar was fun pj clarks was a very good restaurant not part of the hotel but in the same building the room was quite clean and appeared to be renovated i upgraded to a deluxe and was glad i did i saw a regular room and it was much smaller my room faced lincoln centers courtyardfountain and i was serenaded by a jazz group that performed there one afternoon saw and heard them perfectly room 816 cons the safe didnt work very well in the room probably that one safe malfunctioning room service has a very limited selection and limited hours and virtually no healthy food and i could hear the traffic on the street the bathrooms are small but very functional;4
we stayed here at the end of a trip from vegas before flying back to england we arrived about 11pm there were bouncers on the door for the rooftop bar but didnt feel threatened or anything check in was problem free i had booked a budget room it had a double bed without a great deal of space around it but was adequate for our needs and nicely decorated there was no view just the back of other buildings but again i knew this when booking the air con was noisy it didnt bother us too much but others may find it annoying people we spoke to in the hotel asked to be moved the bathroom was also pretty small the hotel lobby is dimly lit with almost club music playing it is also where the bar is based we liked it although it may not be for everyone;4
the hotel was clean and the service was really good the buffet breakfast every morning was great it was really close to all of the hollywood attractions the drive was only about 20 minute or less to everything we wanted to do i was a bit concerned about the hotel because the comments were all over the place but was relieved it was a great hotel im not sure why the other people were complaining im guessing that they must be high maintenance if there was one thing i felt was a little pricey is the charge to park in the lot although there were plenty of parking spaces it was 26day i would definitely recommend this hotel;4
enjoyed our stay but only 2 of 4 elevators were working at any given time so we spent a lot of energy traipsing up and down the stairwells the shower did not work properly the overhead portion did not wok at all so we were left with only the hand held high pressure wand which resulted in a very wet very small bathroom not well though out shower even if working properly i think youll see what i mean great street view friendly service all around and for us a perfect location;4
i stayed here one night in february in between flights this hotel is extremely convenient the shuttle toand from the airport is super easy and comes frequently the lobby and amenities are nice good restaurant gift shop etc the room was modern although room 800 had some water damage peeling wall paper and visible wear and tear on furniture it made me do a deeper look for cleanliness however allinall it was a great option for lax hotels and i would stay here again if i needed to catch an early flight;4
my daughter and i just stayed here recently for the thanksgiving day parade and we had a very nice time our room was nice and clean and the bed was very comfy the location was great with lots of food nearby and the subway was only a block or two away the staff was very nice and helpful my only complaint is the ancient elevator it took forever;4
i had the absolute best nights sleep ive ever had in a hotel i slept better than even my own bed at home their bed and pillows are so super comfortable its centrally located and near great restaurants too;4
this past december me and my two daughters stayed at morningside inn on the upper west side of manhattan this made the 6th or 7th time we have stayed here it is a great place if you are watching your pennies it is a hostel so no mints on your pillow but it is very clean safe and patrick and his staff are wonderful the neighborhood is very safe and it has a lot of great restaurants within walking distance and is very close to columbia university also it is only a couple of blocks from the subway and less than a block from the bus would highly recommend it to anyone;4
we had a wonderful time at the row nyc our checkin process was simple the staff was very helpful and friendly and the place was suitable we would love to stay there again the price is quite reasonable for a nice location;4
this was my first visit to nyc april 2228 2009 i found the jane hotel to be an excellent choice for my needs the hotel is currently being restored and will be even better in the future i knew the room was going to small but wasnt planning to be spending much time there other than to sleep i found it to be very adequate it was clean and quiet there are two large drawers one has a hotel safe and a place for your suitcase under the captains bed the flat screen tv was nice i was told that larger rooms with private baths will be available once the restoration has been completed i was slightly concerned about the shared restroom facilities before i arrived once there i saw how clean everything was put my mind at ease both the showers and the toilets have locks on;4
we stayed in the hollywood hotel for four nights when we arrived in la from australia first off the area is ok we felt perfectly safe walking along vermont avenue even at 10pm i wouldnt have gone down the side streets but walking to the riteaid and the metro station was fine however it isnt anywhere near as nice as north hollywood or beverly hills the hotel itself was very nice clean and modern i think we stayed in a modern room as the furniture and floorings were all new there is a nice courtyard in the middle of the hotel where guests can go for a drink or just relax the service was ok we were able to check in early however other then that the staff were not overly helpful they try to sell a tour which is obviously affiliated with the hotel;4
my last stay was just as i expected nice room good value easy check in and check out definitely a goto for quick business travel one downfall is that at least one elevator seems to be out during each stay but overall a very good stay;4
this hotel was part of a tour with prime sports to see the rose parade and rose bowl we were in an alcove room which was large clean and had views of the hillside the hotel was experiencing elevator problems and are trying to fix the problem there was an extensive wait each time you tried to use the elevators which was annoying even though the hotel is quite large there was very little private setting areas where you could sit with friends play cards or just chill without being closely surrounded the hotel provides a free shuttle to universal city walk which runs every 15 minutes they do not allow standees so several times the wait was extensive because we loaded the bus just to be told we would have to leave and wait for the shuttle to return there is a walkway which;4
nice business hotel efficient clean but no character however you dont tend to need character when you are just about to catch a flight which is what this hotel is meant for they have the added bonus of having a hertz rental dropoff point which is extremely handy if you use them staff are friendly and you wont be waiting long to check in;4
its nice the decor is starkmodern its quiet wifi was spotty and died at an inconvenient moment theres no desk in the room a table suffices good thing my wife wasnt along the vanity light was feeble fluorescent lights in the 21st century the restaurant was pleasant the shrimp stirfry was excellent;4
great hotel in a charming part of the city loved the accessibility to the high line park walking trail and the chelsea market spacious room that was super clean with comfortable beds lots of shopping and art galleries in the area;4
what a good hotel 1929 so plenty of olden charm could do with a few touchs to bring it up to date but on the whole good location for places if you want to walk everywhere which we did the room was on the small side but we liked that nice and cosy beds and pillows are perfect for good sleep have a high floor if possible to help get away from the noisy street and cabs honking all the timethe staff were all very helpfully we did have a small issue but are treating it as a mistake that the room cleaner never owned up to we had a bag of things on the windowsill which we think she thought was rubbish and it went no real money value but lots of sentimental things from the trip the hotel did give us breakfast vouchers for the tick tock diner to compensate;4
my family stayed at the hyatt regency recently while traveling through la the room was nice enough and the beds were comfortable the positives for this hotel are close to airport in room safe and shuttle service tofrom airport the negatives are the bathroom door slides so it doesnât really lock another negative is if you drive to this hotel the parking fee is outrageous one lot will cost you 25 every time you enter the other parking option is valet which costs 40 plus tip every time you access your car;4
being an ignorant brit i figured staying in hollywood would mean hot and cold running models actresses whatevers in every room red carpets on every street and the cops chasing lindsay lohan down every street i was quickly disabused of this ridiculous notion as i pulled up to the hollywood hotel as others have noted the location at vermont and santa monica boulevard looks a little iffy youre a good bit away from the action of hollywood boulevard heres a tip avoid at all costs its rubbish anyway and at first glance there appears to be little charm about the immediate neighbourhood with nothing but shops with metal shutters thai massage parlours and grim bars with no windows nearby apart from that though the hollywood hotel has a lot to recommend it;4
me and my boyfriend recently stayed here for four nights we got one of their suites with a jetted tub which was essentially a jacuzzi in the room before you read ahead i want to stress that we loved our stay here it was so convenient for us to do all of the generic touristy things there were just a few niggles ill start with the pros everything was very clean the suite was huge and the jacuzzi was a godsend the jacuzzi also filled up very quickly breakfast was lovely with fresh waffles an omelette station and all the things you would expect from a continental breakfast too the decor was modern the tvs had lots of channels there was ample parking the bed was very comfy cons the pool was essentially unusable it was ice cold when we got to the;4
staff were absolutely brilliant made two separate great recommendations for food as well as being helpful in general very good location and a nice clean room although quite small breakfast was the let down as it was literally some breakfast bars and orange juice i dont think they should advertise this as breakfast included on the whole good place though;4
nyc at ameritania fun friendly and very helpful staff room was small no refrigerator but the air conditioner was cold clean and comfortable enjoyed our stay we would recommend this hotel great location;4
great place and very comfortable i wish the walls were more sound proofed as any noise from outside sounded as if it was right in my room could have really used a trash can in the bath room otherwise fine;4
excellent location next to penn station walking distance to port authority and 42nd street across the street from 5 major subway lines to take you anywhere you need to go historic hotel museum in lower lobby pretty cool hotel staff were very nice it is definitely a high volume hotel so lots of foot traffic my only complaint which i cannot place on the hotel is the smell of the carpeting at least on my floor and my room this is totally understandable due to volume of guests and the dirtiness of new york streets the hotel was very responsive and offered to change my room i declined as more of a hassle to switch i would recommend and stay here again note daily facilities fee of 29 taxresort fee;4
this is one of the cheapest places i could find to stay in new york in a reasonable area i love to stay in the meatpacking district as it is close to clubs and shopping only thing is if you pay less you stat in a tiny room and share a bathroom which is new to me but i found it ok the hotel has a popular bar downstairs known for celebrity spotting the staff are incredibly helpful the airport lost my luggage and they did everything they could to help the hotel is very close to shops and clubs but about two blocks from a subway stop which was slightly inconvenient;4
we arrive early we rented two rooms in one of the room the carpet was totally wet we asked the front desk and they change th room we had no view at all our windows were overlooking the dirty roof its not that important but i do thing they should tinted the windows the double rooms was very small but very nice the hotel itself is very nice and the staff very helpful and friendly we had the room very cheap to agoda so at the end it was a great deal;4
stayed 5 nights and was happy enough asked for a larger room at check in which they gave us on the second day and was much better room 3204 on 39th floor ask for it as it has a superb view from the airport get the train as hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from penn station staff are polite and helpful lifts are reliable and there is minimal waiting i have seen complaints on here about staff being rude this is not the case in my experience only ate at the on site diner once and it was ok but new york is about exploring so for me you eat different places every day i would stay here again but as for the resort fee which we all hate paying a note to the management this should include luggage storage as charging 2 dollars per item is not fair at all;4
good attention from pascuale at the front desk at the check inn nice room and view of the city from the room good location with nice stores nearby good bar with good vibs and people nice for a couple of days;4
i travelled with my two young nieces and we found the location of the hotel excellent for all we wanted to do and see in the city it was a great base to walk or jump on the subway and given we did some intercity travel by train the proximity to penn station was fantastic the facade and decor of the hotel is lovely but we did find the bathroom a little on the small side though recently renovated and very clean we also found our room quite quiet given the busy location but overall wed happily stay here again;4
great opportunity and price available to this older midtown hotel i would definitely stay there again getting to the hotel is easy from the subway station just a few blocks away checking with the staff about checking early in the day was amazing they were able to find a room that was clean and ready to assign earlier than the normal afternoon checking i dont normally expect getting a room earlier in the day but that was amazing;4
the pros great service we originially had an interior room next to the elevator but after asking we were upgraded to an exterior room more isolated great decor upstairs bar warning very expensive great concierge service lobby is beautiful great location cons shower with no door pay 12 for internet in the room free in the lobby small room this was my first time staying at a four star hotel i was unimpressed as the accomodatns at some marriotts are better i found it on priceline so the price was good but i wouldnt pay the asking price for it got about 50 discount with priceline also we were going to newark and there is a bus that comes directly to the door every hour for 25 per person which is a great deal;4
the room was very pleasant but we seem to always get an interior room with no view after 3 trips and stays at the empire with the fall weather we did have to use the ac to keep the room comfortable the closet was very inadequate and very high for short people the refrigerator did not work and the replacement was not much better service was excellent and staff very friendly and helpful location was for us excellent an nearby restaurants very good we would stay again;4
reservations check in and assistance during our stay was great my family spent saturday night there after the day and next day at universal studios there is renovation occurring so front desk is a small area and not all elevators working but check in went smooth and fast and we didnt wait for an elevator any longer than normal i bought coffee and the peets coffee downstairs along with fruit and two breakfast burritos all of it was excellent the shuttle service to the park is easy quick and frequent every staff was extremely helpful;4
mohamed at the customer service was fantastic he went out of the way to be accommodating to our needs and gave exceptional service made us feel valued the other customer service personnel and the rest of the staff we interacted with were great too a very pleasant experience;4
i have stayed at this hotel several times the rooms can be a little dark but they are clean and big especially by new york standards above all i want to praise pasquale at the front desk he always has a smile on his face and is very eager to help in any way we have always enjoyed our stays at the empire and will continue to use the hotel;4
i picked this hotel because of the location the price is a little high 225 a night with parking at 24 dollars a night additional wifi is free is a good perk for once so no cost for internet the location is great right next to universal and the highways are very close to get around keep in mind that the traffic if really bad so best bet is to double the time anyone tells you to get somewhere i would stay here again they have a nice pool but needs to add a microwave to the rooms;4
we stayed the week before christmas pros 1 only blocks from two different subway stops the columbus circle stop has the a express that will take you to the 911 museum with fewer stops and also has orange and red lines either stop easily transports to tourist locations 2 across the street from lincoln center and right around the corner from a tkts that opened hours earlier than the one on times square 3 drugstore duane reed around the corner cvs 4 blocks away starbucks is on the corner restaurants in vicinity 4 comfortable beds 5 friendly staff cons 1 checkin was difficult one member of the group made the reservation but after calling the front desk in advance the hotel failed to add the other group names to the reservation they;4
excellent location you have everything you need close by rooms are not big but have a reasonable size with nice decor and clean service is good and they are willing to help with what you need they accept incoming mailing prior to arrival but with cost good overall experience will be back;4
i like each room design it does reflecting the hyoe of broadway theatres around ecen if you dont get room with a view your room design will give you sense that you are living in broadway area the staff are very friendly and everything works well;4
i had a very good experience during my stay there i expected a clean place to rest and i got exactly what i was expecting everything was fine i booked through agoda and 3 days before my arrival i called the hotel to confirm my booking and they didnt get it but they told me not to worry about that just to call agoda and they will solve that i called agoda and everything got solved i do recommend to confirm your booking before;4
perfect central location with penn station 34th street subway macys and madison square garden within stumbling distance no own restaurant but two associated restaurants in the building dont expect to find a european continental breakfast though pricey so there are surely more cost effective places to stay one of the few hotels on manhattan that allow up to six persons in a suite;4
weekend with young grandkids to visit universal studios staff was great everyone was very friendly and helpful room was very spacing as well as bathroom bed was comfortable would definitely come back for sure;4
stayed here with my friend for 5 nights check in was great staff very friendly and let us check in slightly early which was nice after a long flight slightly disappointed with room size rm 2141 and view but it was okay we had 2 double beds and we were not in the room much although i wish we had asked for an upgrade like others did but we still enjoyed our stay the location is fantastic and i loved the history of the hotel which you can read about downstairs the staff were all very pleasant and approachable and security was good as you cannot access the lifts without showing your room cards we only ate in the tick tock diner once but the food was good and the service was great we would definitely return to the hotel but i would like a bigger room next time itâs a great;4
booked this room before reading the reviews based on location and price right on the 123 subway line safe neighbourhood reasonable walking distance to a lot of cool stuff the staff were very friendly and efficient while i was having issues with my cc company the desk staff took care of multiple other guests and their issues and still handled my problems in a courteous manner we had a couple of issues we were there during the blizzard after new years and there were heating problems and telephone problems that were dealt with as soon as we reported them the room was comfortable the beds were perfect for us if not a little dated and could use some sprucing up but this didnt get in the way of our experience checkout was quick and easy for a hotel on the uws;4
the hotel shuttle passed us by at the airport we were offered ride from another shuttle operator when he say them zoom by a waving passenger the receptionist didnt seem concerned not a big deal but this is supposed to be a first class hotel;4
great bed with nice water pressure in shower plenty of towels and products left for guests would recommend way over staying at the hyatt regency easy walk to car rental drop off at lax if you want to skip the parking fee;4
very attractive clean hotel within walking distance of universal studios even though im a hiltonhonors member i was told that even though they had rooms available if i wanted to checkin early i would be charged 25 especially when only staying 1 night i dont expect to be charged extra in order to checkin at 10am when im checking out by 9am the next morning only stayed one night after a long day at the park so didnt use any of their facilities but the room was very comfortable and we had a great view of the park;4
really liked the location of the hotel several nice features in the hotel swimming pool and spathe staff was super friendly special thanks to daniel for helping out and making my visit great would defo come here again;4
great location right by central park and the subway you can also walk to most of the areas except maybe chinatown and battery park pool is small but does the job the pool deck is nice and relaxing i would recommend staying here;4

i had a one night stay at ameritania when i was going out to dinner and a play the hotel looks freshly renovated and very modern i booked a room with one queen bed it wasnt ready when i arrived so the very friendly and helpful person at the front desk gave me a room with two double beds at no extra charge the room was spotlessly clean and had everything youd want in a hotel room including a closet something many modern hotels dont have anymore the bathroom had a large shower no tub and the modern half a shower door look which does lead to a little water on the floor if youre not careful bed was comfortable there were even extra blankets in the dresser if you needed one the location of the hotel is perfect around the corner from the ed sullivanstephen;4
this hotel is in a great location to downtown attractions walking distance from time square and broadway hotel was beautiful and the rooms were a little on the small side but comfortable great views of the city and it was quite and safe there was a rather long line a check in and we had small issues with guest services but all were handled quickly to our satisfaction i truly feel like we got the best bang for our buck and would recommend this hotel to anyone;4
i was over one year ago but better later than never i was solo so i didnt expect much from the airport i took subway so its easy to get therechange trains somewhere i cant remember where from subway station very close i was there to visit so my plan was only sleep in hotelbought unlimited metrocard for a week and spent days in new york so for me it was very good choice i spent there only four nightsbathroom comf bed so what else i needed cheapi cant remember but about 60 per night for those who complainstay somewhere in the city and spent twice or three times more if u buy cheap car and then complain why didnt u buy ferrari;4
this is a wonderful old hotel updated to modern decor in the perfect location for attending any events at lincoln centerits right across the street the lobby and public spaces are really cool and theres a restaurant chowder house a bar in the lobby with a mezzanine level of cozy seating all of which are all very inviting a starbucks is next door and other restaurants outside also theres room service available a penthouse seasonal pool and other facilities on the top floor which we did not use the rooms are spotless but small with lovely appointments i would most happily stay here again because the hotel has everything we need for a fair nightly rate here we dont have to pay a high rate for facilities and services that we are never going to use;4
only one caveat small rooms bathrooms compared to newer hotels if that doesnt bother you everything else was absolutely fine newly refurbished rooms our floor at least excellent new gym near enough to high line and path along hudson for early am runners ok wifi subway just around the corner friendly knowledgeable staff reasonable restaurants room service in the hotel plenty of classic nyc diners in the neighborhood if not upper end restaurants of note near macys empire state penn station and a better price than newer fancier ny hotels ive visited in recent months if you stay make a visit to the lower level to look at pictures and memorabilia from the hotels early days very cool;4
fantastic location we came here on our honeymoon and was a lovely hotel slightly disappointed with the room bathroom had no heating so was freezing staff very pleasant would book to stay here again but maybe upgrade our room;4
this was a great little hotel right in the heart of manhattan right next to madison square garden and a 10 minute walk from times square all the major tourist attractions are easily accessible from here only drawback was the noise from the street outside;4
an ultra cool hotel that was the perfect spot for a girls weekend on the upper westside about two blocks from central park a junior suite comfortably fit three of us as a king bed and a pullout sofa was ideal when not in use the sofa and chairs area of the suite was a great meeting spot staffing is pleasant and helpful especially the bell men dennis the menace is super funny the bar area could use more servers as we waited at an upstairs table for close to 30 minutes and never saw a cocktail server the place was jammed and could have made a ton of cash on a saturday night if they were appropriately staffed the smith across the street is a great dining spot we went both mornings for breakfast they do take reservations just so you know pj clarkes;4
astor on the park is extremely basic but what more can you expect from the price for what we paid we couldnt expect any more the first room we were given was tiny there was literally a foot of space surrounding the bed you could touch both walls at the same time however we asked to move and this was done swiftly and with no complications the second room had 2 double beds and therefore was larger but proportionately it was the same the room was fully equipped with a wardrobe drawers a small but spotlessly clean bathroom with a ledge for toiletries plug sockets tv alarmradio and phone each day the room was cleaned to a very high standard and my standards are high and clean towels were provided yes astor on the park is small and basic but in ny you;4
we stayed at hilton universal city on march 22 had a room on the 22nd floor which had a terrific birdseye view of the nearby hills streets and the freeway walking distance to universal studios and city walk the shuttle van to city walkuniversal studios came every 15 minutes or so sometimes standingroomonly because he hotel was booked but still very convenient it also stops at the sheraton next door the only other hotel in the area you can walk but it is an awkward walk across the curving hillside road where cars are arriving to the park so after dark or on a hot rainy or busy day the shuttle is a good option the rooms were up to date and very clean contemporary style beds were very comfortable service was very good at the front desk and restaurant we;4
room was very clean very quiet we stayed on the 5th floor in a small corner room with a single queen bed paid 90night and was very happy service was excellent both housekeeping and desk clerks the only thing that kept this place from getting a perfect review was the lack of inroom internet access the lowquality tv offerings and the small hot and slow elevators minor stuff when compared with the value quality of the lodgings themselves;4
we all love nyc and in my opinion a hotel should act as an oasis from the constant noise and hectic the empire is good value for money and has a very friendly staff however loud afternoon djs on the rooftop can deter from the need for piece having said that the hotel is overall great for 199 or so super location right next to lincoln sq enjoy;4
location at top of times square near central park is fantastic super close to the subway too rooms were clean and my room was reasonable size bartender in small bar downstairs was great airconheating quite noisy but not unbearable wifi charge was a little annoying and the phone signal in the room was very up and down 5 charge for small bottle of water beside the bed was a little cheeky;4
airport shuttle was quick easy great friendly service and the renovated rooms were clean and quiet certainly recommend this for easy lax access nice large hotel lobby bar and eatery perfect business trip option;4
continue to offer that quality customer service i really enjoyed my stay and appreciate your assistance when i need it i look forward to coming back to yo with my family and i will recommend the eh;4
it was a great stay a very good location owing to its proximity to metro red line to hollywood and to union station staff is very co operative and a very friendly and safe location for everyone moreover there are good restaurants nearby;4
what a find slap bang in the middle of the action with eateries for breakfast lunch and evening meal on site food delicious and reasonable and incredibly hard working diligent staff regardless of how busy they get free toiletries too just the thing for a deep bath and hardcore shower that felt like an indian head massage the rooms are ample in size as was the queen size bed comfy pillows and crisp white sheets and towels just the thing after 4 days nyc sightseeing my daughter met us with the shiny new son in law they stayed for 2 nights and got 40 off so there are discounts to be had id have given it 5 if we had been given bottles of water and the decor had been a little more upmarket but all in all a marvellous art deco building complete with gymthank you;4
couples foodie trip the janes location puts you in the heart of any foodies dream location the rooms were small but tasteful definitely worth the extra cash to spring for a private shower we read in the paper on the flight home that tom brady and gisele were at a party in the motel the very night we were there;4
its right next to penn station and madison square garden so across the street from the subway that you can take all the way to laguardia and down to the world trade center as well as other routes just south of times square otherwise it is an older high rise building i would guess 90 years old not sure it was ever deluxe and theres some deferred maintenance rooms are small at least mine was and they told me that they upgraded me from an even smaller room the upkeep and maid service is good however wyndham management means its got the shampoo conditioner handcream soaps decent cable tv safe and wifi no frills like minibars or anything like that no guidebook to the hotel or city or anything decent place if you really intend to spend most of your time;4
the elevators were not working well while we stayed there but everything else was fantastic the rooms are well sized nicely decorated comfortable the location is truly amazing i highly recommend this hotel;4
fanny was great service at breakfast the breakfast environment was great they replaced my room in a timely fashion and it was better than expected i love the diversity in california and people of all kinds stayed here so it was good to meet nice people;4
we chose the hilton because of its proximity to universal studios we stayed two nights and left with a very good impression our room was clean and comfortable it was also quiet despite the fact that it overlooked the freeway the free shuttle that ran every 15 minutes to universal studios was a great option given that it rained one of the days we were there the downstairs restaurant was better than most hotel restaurants weve tried we found the staff to be friendly and helpful we would stay again if we were returning to the area;4
great location great staff and super clean nice rooms although a bit small especially the bathroom they should have informed us that the room had no view we had great expectations and we were disappointed overall good though;4
room was a good size for a times sq hotel clean and nicely laid out lobby with fireplace was cozy really really convenient location steps to theaters and restaurants street construction outside was a bit noisy though staff was friendly courteous and efficient;4
initial contact and check in were excellent the ladies on the desk were very pleasant we had a room overlooking the courtyard which was small but sufficent secure parking although there is a charge per day shops are close by as is the subway which is a great way to get around and breakfast daily was great;4
the empire hotel is right in the middle of everywhere you want to go in manhattan next to lincoln center and central park walking distance to the theater district wonderful upper west side restaurants upper east side shopping and easy subway access to be downtown to soho or uptown to the cloisers in just a few minutes the rooms are not large but everything was wellappointed the staff members are courteous and responsive to requests we were initially given a room wo a view and when asked for a change were accommodated without problem staff member pasquale was particularly helpful;4
clean well equipped hotel within 10 minutes walk of universal entrance great for visiting the park and city walk but the prices to eat are all high there and there are few other places to eat nearby hotel itself has a pleasant pool it felt safe had free toiletries and was kept clean;4
we stayed here for 8 days in september from uk the hotel is in a perfect location with the main subway being a few minutes walk away the staff are very helpful and friendly and the taxi back to the airport can be booked with the concierge so that you get a safe taxi ride always use authorised vehicles to and from jfk the staff were unbelievably good with customer service when i booked the room and gave us a room with direct view of the empire state building and the chrysler which was top drawer the foyer is gorgeous with its art deco decor but some of the corridors and our room was a little tired however for the price it was totally acceptable staff always on hand for assistance room always cleaned properly each day cash machine coffee counter in reception and;4
i have stayed in over 40 hotels in the last 6 months and this hotel is by far the most professionally run and the staff is extremely competent and compassionate the only negative is the location in chinatown and the presence of so many rodents at night that it seemed like bens birthday party;4
we checked in to room 3608 small but has everything you need including ironboard housekeeping was spot on my only gripe would be the hairdryer could only be used in the bathroom because there was no plug socket near the room mirror like the fact you can only access the elevators to rooms when you show a room key especially when the tick tock restaurant is open to the lobby 247 all staff helpful and very friendly we arrived 3 hours before check in time but that was not a problem and were given our room key straightaway our view was 34th street all the way down to the hudson also expended our check out by two hours without any charge would highly recommend this hotel which also has a great central location just a few minutes walk from empire state and madison square;4
loved the view from our room room was older but very clean and comfortable bathroom was very old and small but very clean loved the location not to close to time square with all the crowd but close enough for a walk there it was perfect for our needs would stay there again;4
we stayed here for a night because we were going to a concert at the gibson its a nice hotel and i was impressed by the massive size of the buffet as we walked by eg king crab legs oysters madetoorder sushi etc about 50 for dinner i was told our room overlooked the sf valley and it was quite nice good linens pillows etc i would definitely stay here again;4
frist class all the way stay again in a minute the staff bend over backwards to please you the only draw back is the parking you can add atlease 30 to 50 dollars a day to park at hotel smoking outside great sites good bar plenty of goodies everyday 5 to 10 dollars a drink;4
i was charmed by this hotel the remaining art deco features are a delight the adjacent diner was superb with lovely food and charming and helpful waiters its location is superb just down the road from macys and close to maddison square okay so some of the rooms are a bit dated but thats the charm security and staff excellent;4
the empire is very close to the southern end of central park and within relatively easy walking distance of major landmarks such as the rockefeller centre times square and the empire state building the hotel itself is opulent in appearance with very dark and cold lobby area and mezzanine but the room was good and bed very comfortable staff were helpful and courteous theres a coffee machine in the room but pods cost 250 or 3 each free wifi is only available in the lobby area we booked the hotel partly because of location but also because of the rooftop bar with a view of the skyline unfortunately we arrived towards the end of september and although the weather was still good the bar was closed during our stay which was a huge disappointment all in all an enjoyable;4
been to better been to worse very old fashioned hotel italian restaurant attached very good my main gripe is that when you check in â£120 was taken from my bank account using my registered credit card i understand that but its been a week since we checked out and the money has not been returned yet;4
beds linens and towels were good quality maid service was excellent bathrooms need to be updated;4
the location is really great facilities are somewhat worn and we had some technical difficulties never managed to connect to wifi had to pick up recoded keys because of malfunction and the valet parking was not user friendlynot possible to ask for your car to be delivered at a certain time but always call to ask for it 20 min in advance i believe this is convenience for the front desk not the customer;4
first thing that comes to mind when entering the hotel lobby is wow the view of universal studios from my room was awesome the pool and jacuzzi area is breathtaking however when it comes to service there is quite a room for improvement i will list down point wise 1 the shower was pouring only hot water or warm water there was no cold water and i had a tough time with it 2 after i came back home i saw a charge of 921 usd extra as room service on inquiry i found out that they have charged for 2 water bottles which i never consumed it appears that there were supposed to be 3 bottles while there was just 1 when i checked in it means they didnt check the room properly after the last guest checked this is the least you can expect from a hotel 3 many of the lamps;4
found the hilton in universal city la to be pretty decent we were warmly welcomed by the reception staff and the bell services where promt in taking out luggage to our room however was frustrated when we were disturbed by a member of the cafe sierra staff to inform us that aparently there was no credit card on file in our room even though we had already made charges and had to wait a substantial time at reception to enquire also while dining at the bar opposite cafe sierra we had to wait ages to be served and our food took a long time to also come out as well the woman waiting the tables was not vigilant to serve any new customers that arrived it was that bad one night and we were waiting a long time to have our order taken we just left and orderd room service;4
i chose the empire hotel for its proximity to lincoln center and fordham i enjoyed my stay the location is amazing especially for shows at lincoln center the lobby is beautiful and very hip and i was pleased to have a room upgrade to a king deluxe with a view overlooking lincoln center and a welcome bottle of champagne the room was spacious with a comfy king size bed and an area for a side chair and desk the bathroom was tiny and had a european style with a half glass panel for the shower and a shallow flat sink my only gripe is having to pay for coffee and wifi there is a keurig machine in the room and each cup of coffee is 3 it beats having to go out for your first cup but given the rates at this hotel it would be nice to have this at no charge on my;4

excellent stay in a great hotel check in was quick and efficient and we were in our room within 20 minutes no wait for the elevators as experienced by some room was small as expected but spotlessly clean and warm bathroom again small but clean all the staff we encountered from check in concierge housekeeping and security were cheerful friendly and helpful hotel in a very central location easy to walk to all major attractions and with a subway entrance on both corners what more could you want;4
had event at lincoln ctr perfect for what we needed easy access to park subway shopping and food rooms comfortable ac could be a little stronger had to open windows to get airone window did not function well;4
overall its a great hotel very conveniently located rooms are small but clean staff is polite and friendly bathrooms are quite worn out but okay its a good value for nyc very close to subway central park walking distance if you like walking to time square stay there on a yearly basis so id recommend it;4
after reading some of the reviews prior to our trip my boyfriend and i did not know what to expect but we thought the hotel was great we just returned from a weekend trip sept 20sept 23 and spent 3 nights at the empire in room 821 we paid a special rate of 280 which i think is reasonably for the hotel i probably wouldnt have paid more this hotel we arrived around noon and were able to check right into the hotel upon checking in the lobby was fairly empty and we only had to wait a few minutes to check in after going to our room i loved the decor of course the room was tiny but that is to be expected while in nyc last time i stayed at the parker meridian around the same rate and i would say our room at the empire was larger the bed was comfy and clean as was the;4
arriving saturday for a sunday seminar i found the jane hotel to be a more than pleasant surpriseits location on a quanint cobblestone street lined with well maintained brownstones is charming front desk personnel were kind professional and courteous the gentleman on duty the evening i arrived was able to direct me to an excellent all night deli my cabin style room while small was clean well appointed bath shoes and robe provided the tv lights alarm clock and internet all worked finean underbed set of drawers were large enough to store my goods a safe is also provided to lock important items when out of room one large window afforded me a view of the river and skyline the shared bath was clean and neat renovations were underway in the lobby area which by;4
the empire is across the plaza from lincoln center and very very convenient to the upper west side of manhattan yet only 12 blocks from the theatre district they were running a 40 discount sale when we booked and that made the expensive nyc hotel scene seem much more affordable my wife adult daughter and i stayed in a junior suite the room was spacious the closet space was limited and not well lit the main bed was too firm for our tastes for the sale price charged the room was an excellent value for new york city;4
bit of a pain to get to waiting for a bus for 1015 mins and not great sign postingâ¦ 1st floor and to your right coming out of the international terminal check in out easy enough and room was modern comfortable vending machine and ice on our floor 10th restaurant had a decent atmosphere but food was a bit stale 247 market if you arrive outside of typical hours and need a bite to eat shuttle bus back to the airport was every 20 mins we left at 8pm ok if youâve got a late early flight if you connect with them directly you can book a room for a few hours instead of paying the over night price;4
the location of the empire hotel is great the people how work in it are allmost friendly and helpful you can see that the hotel isnt the youngest but thats ok i think we would be back in a future trip to ny thank you very much;4
stay 10th may 2012 13th may 2012 chose this hotel for its location initially was not v impressed with the hotel exterior but the room was quite nice most importantly the people at the reception were v helpful special mention of cecile not only did she help me with an early checkin she was extremely sweet and v v helpful my entire tour of 4 cities consisting of 15 days and can say she was most helpful out of all though cannot say that about the receptionist who was there during check out location was v convenient there was a metro station a block away from the hotel breakfast could be better not only can the quality be improved they also refill their dishes at v long gaps and dnt if they run out of stuff however the lady making the omelettes and;4
the location has a lot to offer but you need to press the staff to find out what they offer a map of the grounds can be found at the front desk and i recommend taking a picture to help locate the gym and pools;4
i was concerned about this hotel after reading some of the negative reviews but was extremely pleased with the room we walked into a small but friendly lobby and got great service our room was clean and quite nice including the bathroom everything looked new i requested ahead of time and got a room with 2 clean nicely made up comfortable full size beds which can be difficult in nyc no problems whatsoever really enjoyed the stay;4
i was in ny for 3 days and the jane hotel is my favorite if you dont mind shared bathroom and very small room its perfect very good prices for manhattan the staff is welcoming and always ready to help you the area is full of good restaurants bars galleries beside the great whitney museum and very near the entrance for the high line its ã 40minutes enjoyable walk to times square;4
it is the location that sells this hotel it is 10 minute walk from universal studious with a shuttle if needed our room was on the first floor the beds were small nd the bathroom was a little dated parking and internet cost extra and the hotel is extremely busy after our time there i am not sure the location made it worth the cost i probably would have stayed a little furthers from the park and found a nicer place for the price;4
we spend 4 nights inclusive 15 year old boy in this hotel and our conclusion not bad at all neighborhood shops houses people central park subway room our room 25 feet bathroom clean no rats clean towels clean bed no design no marmer elevators lobby are aged but who cares after this hotel we spend 2 nights in the luxury hotel the fairmont in washington yes thats a great difference but also more expensive so good value not bad at all steef holland;4
the hotel is located next to universal studios and is suitable for the studio visitors the car parking is very convenient but should be paid by the guest 30 usd per day the breakfast is very tasty and the rooms are large and comfortable the shower is comfortable but in old design the hotel is different from the other hilton hotels i visited as it does not includes bathrobes slippers and free bottled water however after i demanded it they gave it may be it given only for high class of rooms while in other hilton i visited it given to all class of rooms;4
this hilton is absolutely beautiful the views are great the lobby is lovely and the pool area was fantastic the first room we were given smelled of smoke even though it was a nonsmoking room the smoke instantly set off our allergies however the staff was very helpful and polite and quickly helped us get a different room which didnt smell like smoke at all once we got into our room it was very nice and comfortable the hotel is a short walk away from universal city walk and studios it was a little further than id expected but no big deal overall this is a very nice hotel and i would definitely stay here again;4
we were catching an early flight to lax so decided to spend the night the check in and check out was smooth and quick the shuttle service was very reliable and for this one quick night stay it worked out very well i would book here again;4
if you travel to nyc frequently you know that hotel rates can be high and rooms can be small in the case of the ameritania deluxe king the room was a very generous size for nyc and the price during festive season was reasonable the room itself has correct amenities for a three star property for example donât expect slippers and i was especially grateful for the minifridge to store insulin i also appreciated that it had an overhead light as well as lampsâso many hotels donât actually have lights in the ceiling there were also lots of hangers in the closet another wonderful surprise in an era of euroâdesignâ hotels who think you donât need anything more than a couple of pegs on the wall there was also a huge full length mirror as well as heavy curtains and good;4
we stayed here for four nights and found the hotel quite acceptable the staff were friendly and helpful room was clean and room fresh breakfast was better than the average motel and helped by freshly made omelettes i was a bit shocked by the 22 a night parking charge wifi is complimentary and the pool looked ok i am aware some reviewers have been disappointed by their stay there may be some variation on rooms and service but we were satisfied;4
was excited to find a reasonable priced hotel in new york in a lovely neighbourhood the meat packing district and on this basis this hotel delivered the rooms are small but perfectly formed for one however like the other reviewers i found the room to be constantly super heated despite leaving the window open and then when i did turn on the fan or the air conditioning i couldnt even have a conversation on the phone and had to turn the tv up very loud which i am sure that the neighbours werent that impressed with this meant that i really didnt sleep very well on either night i stayed as i was either too hot or kept awake by the fanair con and then if i did get the temperature comfortable the noisy plumbing started despite the air plugs so if you dont mind;4
i had a good experience at this hostel it is conveniently located to the hammersmith bus tube station and has an n9 bus stop directly to heathrow nearby convenient since there was a tube strike on my last day there i had shelving for clothes and a fridge in my room friendly staff clean relatively quiet lots of available informationwhat else could one need;4
my daughter and i were staying four days in this hotel we enjoyed the location and the hotel staff was mostly nice we enjoyed the beds and pillows the were amazing our room was cleaned daily and the staff were very nice when asked for extra towels ect i would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to new york city ðð the only complaint i have is the evelators are horrible you always have to wait on them also we were stick on our floor waiting on a elevator for like 40 minutes or morebeing so far up i cannot go on the stair overall we had a pleasant stay love the doorman they were so sweet and went out of their way to help;4
the only reason i did not give it 5 stars was the extra charges 25 a night for parkingthen continental breakfast which is included as an honors member offers toast and muffins we did not realize the difference between the huge buffet if you pay the upgrade and the 2 foot section if you dont point being 15 per person for toast and muffin or 25 if you want the buffet we got eggs which is included at most other hiltons but here we were handed a check so just ask before you graze the buffet so enough whining the rooms are huge make sure to ask for a renovated roomas they are in the middle of a major upgrade all the rooms seem to have a good view we were on 14 and faced the hollywood hills and great sunsets ask for the view you want as the property has;4
stayed four nights and was pretty satisfied with the stay its a smoking hotel so all of the rooms smell like smoke the hallway lobby and elevator smell of it too the carpet in our room seemed like it hadnt been cleaned in awhile but the hotel must have heard this one before because they provide complimetary slippers when i first sat on the bed it was like sitting on a block on cement it was so hard that when i plopped down i hurt myself there is absolutely no cushion no bounce no movement to this bed but surprisingly i had one of the best sleeps ive ever had its the strangest thing the wifi was hit or miss i asked the front desk to help and they were pretty useless if youre expecting good customer service youre not going to find it here the front;4

arrived at the hotel around 10am after a long flight from australia didnt think we would be able to get into our room that early but thought wed give it a try anyway michelle at the front desk was super friendly and offered us the option of paying for an early checkin which for the small price we gladly accepted the hotel building and interior is a little dated but generally clean and comfortable the best thing however is the close distance to universal studios theme park which we had planned to do straight away theres a complimentary shuttle that departs the hotel and the park every 10 mins and its about a 510 minute drive this is a perfect option if youre planning on spending the day at the theme park or other sights close by;4
booked this through expedia which did not reveal name of hotel until after nonrefundable reservation was made consequently was not privy to past reviews until i was committed to stay when i was able to read reviews my first thought was ohoh but to my relief i waspleasantly surprised my room was a bit small but it had everything i needed it was clean well stocked with necessities and essentials and provided an excellent view the bed was very comfortable the staff was beyond exceptional my checkin began with michelene who was very pleasant and accommodating later i indulged on the services of the concierge chris who went out of his way to be helpful emanuel patiently helped me resolve some questions i had at check out and finally yuri also of;4

we were very happy with our stay here the location cant be beaten if you are visiting universal studios it is a very easy 5 to 10 minute walk with no hassles of crossing busy streets the staff were very friendly and efficient our room was clean and spacious the bed was very comfortable the large windows give great views of the surrounding area the house keepers do a great job of keeping everything clean the pool area is large and a great place to relax the bar in the hotel is a nice place to sit and relax at the end of the day we ate all of our meals at the city walk so close and so many choices;4
if youre visiting universal studios this hotel is the closest to the park entrance and an easy 7 minute walk from door to door the rooms were very nice amazingly soft beds and pillows spacious and clean theres a coffee maker and mini fridge we had a great meal in the bar area after getting back kind of late and it was really good the wait staff were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed you have to pay for parking less than parking at universal but you get to leave your car in the lot until 6pm the day you check out for no additional cost sure the rooms are a bit pricey but the proximity and comfort made for a couple of fun hasslefree memorable days at universal;4

stayed here for three nights excellent location right by penn street subway and near times square check in fine apart from allocating us a room which people were occupying but that was soon sorted by giving us a new room on 25th floor the room itself was bigger than expected with two showers double double and suited us fine it does need renovating but to be honest we werent in the room for long so for us it didnt matter the hotel bar is very reasonable price wise and we didnt use the diner as the hotel is so central no charges for us to pay since we booked with virgin holidays but we did have to pay 5 dollars per suitcase to store them on our last day which was to us seemed like a money maker;4
enjoyed our stay here very much staff were friendly and helpful had requested early checkin and got it with a smile room was clean and spacious we had a great view of universal the freeway and surrounding hills restaurant is expensive so we had most meals at city walk there is a shuttle to universal studioscity walk which is frequent and convenient another shuttle takes you almost to the metro stop which we used to get to downtown hollywood the best hotel we stayed at during our vacation;4
it was a nice hotel at a walking distance to universal studios unfortunately they are repairing their lifts and it took a while to get a lift staff was very courteous and room had a good view of the universal studio we got free internet during our stay they gave us bottles of water when we checked in but housekeeping staff did not keep new bottles of water after refreshing the room;4
traveling from michigan to see our daughter between semesters and had the best experienceexcellent service from the moment we arrived pil and nicole went out of their way to help us with all our needs will return;4
my husband and i stayed here for two nights on the 14th and 15th we found a clean spacious and comfortable room we were on the 5th floor facing the pool with a nice view of the hills beds were very comfy i agree with other reviewers that the elevators were slow and not all of them appeared to work valet parking away convenient and quick i would recommend this hotel for those looking for a quiet convenient location to most of the la attractions like most of the studios hollywood blvd and sunset strip etc while we didnt visit the universal studios park or studio we were pleasantly surprised to find the city walk a quick 10 mins with plenty of food options;4
the hotel has undergone extensive renovation and looks and feels very nice the front desk staff was very helpful and upgraded us for our overnight stay the room was relatively large for a ny city hotel the location of the hotel is near the port authority terminal and within easy walking distance of many broadway shows;4
whenever we visit la we always stay here the hotel is continuously a winner the location of the hotel is perfect for us being close to universal city walk gives so many dinner options you are close enough to la but at the same time far enough away to not feel like your in the middle of the cbd the hotel offers quality accommodation and an always friendly team of staff i would continue to highly recommend staying here;4
the hotel was very nice when we walked in greeted by two friendly employees the room was small very nice and suited our needs for the night i really enjoyed the walkin shower and it was helpful due to my boyfriend being on crutches ac was slightly loud and didnt cool down the room as much as i would have liked but overall i had a quiet nights sleep breakfast was ok we would definitely go back;4
my partner and i stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed our stay checking in was a breeze and reception staff were very friendly the girl anna on front desk was worth her weight in gold so helpful knowledgable and friendly nothing was too much trouble she really made us feel at home location is perfect with metro station a few minutes away breakfast was included and was a great start to every day would definitely come back here again;4
overall i give it a four for what it is i would rate it a five its clean reasonably priced and has a great location the front desk staff were incredibly friendly they have coffee juice and bagels for breakfast in the morning there is also a fridge in the room thats about it as far as amenities there is a convenience store within easy walking distance so you can stock up on refreshments there is parking across the street for an additional 15 i stayed in the james dean room on the first floor its an accessible room not sure what kind of handicap dean had the bed was extremely comfortable and there was a ceiling fan which was a nice touch my only complaint was the television it was mounted in the corner of the room near the head of the bed very hard to;4
great trip to ny to see the rockefeller tree the new yorker was great because of the ambiance they could change a few of their policies though coffee in the room or at least in the lobby as one example;4
for a hotel in midtown it was perfect what i mean by that is that most midtown hotels dont have free coffee in the room and a lot of the perks people are used to these days but the staff is great there is a small cafe in the lobby area for coffee and snacks and the history of the place is oneofakind if you are looking for an interesting stay with staff that stays on top of security and housekeeping i recommend the new yorker;4
i stayed 5 nights at the empire hotel ending with the labor day weekend over all it was a very nice stay i had a small room in the interior my friends had larger rooms with views but since we spend very little time in our rooms it did not make a big difference staff was friendly check in and out was quick and painless the location is wonderful there are two subway stations close by and central park is just across the street also coming from europe i always wake up very early and go for a walk its a nice area for a morning constitutional and starbucks right on the corner open at 530 am the only two down sides i can find is the very noisy air condition if i turned mine off the unites around me were still very noticable and the fact that the hotel does not;4

i have stayed at the hollywood hotel now several times and i will go back again it is a lovely clean hotel that has an exceptional staff at the front counter ali and the crew are friendly courteous and professional mike in the gift shop is always there with a smile and some good advise the complimentary breakfast is lovely and the chef will make you a fresh omelet of your choosing the pool is nice but there is no washroom and is across the parking lot from the hotel the sun is only there until late afternoon so go early i found the comedy show that is offered down stairs some evenings to be vulgar and in bad taste over all this is a lovely property that has many upgrades and they are constantly trying to improve;4
i stayed for over a week overall i have nothing really bad to say keep in mind this is a budget hotel and it is quite small only 4 or floors you get what you pay for and i had a quiet stay pros near penn station friendly and helpful staff almost like a family hotel cons no elevator cleanliness is not the best breakfast room is small but i its ok considering the difference in price if compared to other hotels;4

arrived on monday the eve of snowmageddon and watched the city close down from the windows 3 of our spacious corner suite room spectacular sadly the opera we had come to see was canceled instead we walked in the snow found provisions in the many small bodegas on broadway and even found a fantastic sushi bar on 72nd street that was still open the empire is perfectly situated one block from the subway surrounded by restaurants stores and a block away central park tuesday things returned to normal and that night we walked across the plaza to the greatest opera house in the world will definitely be back again fantastic door men;4
this is a nice hotel this is my second time to stay here and am a bit biased being a hilton honors member the room is clean and up to date the beds are comfortable and service is great staff are always helpful and make you feel at home i booked directly with the hotel my bad on that i am here on business others i spoke with paid much less i should have booked through expedia or other third party and could have saved 100 plus a night bugs me a bit to book directly with the hotel and pay more for it;4
my girlfriend and i recently visited la and stayed at the hilton universal city during our trip we wanted to be close to universal studios to make the most out of our visit and figured that the hilton would be a good choice the hotel itself is in a great location around 510 minutes walk away from university citywalk we used the valet parking when arriving at the hotel and there were plenty of bell staff to help unload our luggage and get us to the check in desk throughout the entire stay the staff at the hotel were really very helpful they did pretty much everything to make our stay enjoyable when we checked in we were given access to the executive lounge as im a hilton hhonors member which was a nice touch and were escorted to the elevator with our luggage by;4
a hotel with an awesome location from our room we could see the metropolitan opera and a view up broadway room was a bit small nyc you know a superior king nicely appointed and very clean housekeeping was excellent prompt and efficient hotel lobby very sumptuous and all employees very accommodating all together a great experience the only reason not rated a 5 is the settee and dresser were not level and drawers kept coming out a chin knocking or tripping hazard also ordered a bucket of ice one evening around 930pm and gave up at 11pmwent to bed wouldnt hesitate to stay again;4

just returned from a nice stay at the hilton our second stay at this hotel we chose it as previously for its location not just for universal studios but for its access to the other attractions close by and access to the arterial roads around la the rooms are very clean and spacious with an in room fridge and coffee maker all standard fare that you would expect what we did find unexpected was the cost for wifi hilton charge 795 tax per day per device which i think is a cheek when i had just stayed for 3 days in a hilton group hotel and had free wifi also car parking is not cheap either getting more expensive at weekends as mentioned in another review the wait time for elevators can be frustrating in this busy hotel the pool area is very nice with plenty of;4
was traveling in for a rangers game and wanted to try something new i havent stayed at before from bookingcom their price for a queen with a view wasnt horrible so decided to book the good location between msg shopping times square etc great central place to be not far from subway to getting around is simple the view holy moly the view 37th floor was uhmazeing i stay in the city usually a few times a year and this was probably the best view ive had of the skyline splurge the extra few bucks for the view if you have the chance the staff was very friendly wifi was good no issues when i was using it in lobby or in the room the bed i slept well the average the room size typical nyc room not spacious but didnt need it if i were;4
we usually stay at the beverly hills hilton but because of the academy awards their prices were sky high there are two standouts at the universal hilton one is outstanding service by all employees we came into contact withfrom the greeting we received by the doormen to the desk to the restaurant the other standout is the sumptuous breakfast buffet whether you choose the entire buffet including hot items or the continentalthis buffet put the beverly hilton breakfast buffet to shame i dont quite understand why the bhh has such a poor buffet ive written about it previously although for our purposes universals location is not ideal it is a lovely property;4
this is definitely the place to stay at universal city as opposed to the sheraton we arrived late and left early so i didnt really see much of the hotel there is a 17 selfparking charge for the garage as with many places a couple of snafus during my stay the remote control for the tv didnt work maybe the batteries were dead normally this would be a big deal but it was late and i was tired so i just read email and went to bed then during the night staff slid a hotel receipt with no numbers under my door then replaced it with a receipt with no letterhead turns out the night staff had printed out the receipts before doing the audit according to the beleaguered morning clerk and so we had to go to the desk to check out in the morning frankly;4
i was worried about several things before my first visit to the jane of course there was the whole shared bathroom ideathough ive done this before in small european b bs this wasnt my usual style for nyc i usually stay upper west side but this was my second justforme trip this year and the prices for places i usually stay or comparables were over 300night i couldnt justify spending that much so booked the jane at the still higher than normal 135night for a single room i was also concerned with reviews that mentioned hard beds hot rooms noisy neighbors i was very happy that none of this applied to my stay in fact i actually had to use my alarm to wake up as i slept so soundly and comfortably my room was tiny but the space was well organizedreminded me;4

the is a solid 4 star hotel i only stayed one night as we live an hour away and just wanted to visit friends over the weekend and didnt want to drive back and forth 2 days in a row this hotel served our purposes perfectly comfortable clean and a beautiful view of lincoln center from our room parking on street relatively easy my only complaint is coming from the suburbs we are used to quiet while we sleep we were on floor 7 and it was a little noisy late did not wake us up though if you are used to a city atmosphere it probably wont bother you;4

i stayed here for a convention which was held downtown since i didnt like the area around the convention center i intentionally decided to book a hotel in universal city area im glad i did the rooms are very nice and the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very well prepared there was very little noise around the hotel mainly because the building is rather removed from the main drag i had a wonderful view of the valley from my room the free shuttle to universal citywalk was very convenient i think this property would be perfect for someone who is visiting universal cityhollywood areas for leisure only downside which was mainly my own fault is that the transportation to downtown took a long time in retrospect this is probably not the best choice for;4

the empire rocks the best thing about the empire hotel is their staff from the gentleman who greeted us and got us settled when we first arrived to the fabulous front desk staff we felt very welcome nick at the front desk was especially helpful and gracious and helped my friend heather find exactly what she was looking for the location of the hotel is great and is easy access for anything you want to do in the city amazingly the room was also comfortable and quiet at night so we were able to sleep great on a business trip overall a very fun place;4
we stayed here for several nights and were impressed the rooms are a bit small and the bathrooms are tiny the location is wonderful for broadway madison square garden restaurant row times square and the diamond district the staff were helpful and the security tight there is a decent workout room and a little museum chronicling the history of the hotel there are two restaurants on the property as well it might could use a cleaningupgrade though;4
its a hilton and its next to universal studios its s hilton means that it is a decent 34 star hotel very good staff ok rooms a decent enough breakfast but at the same time nothing special the overall hotel and rooms have a tired feel to them and that is despite a recent refurb our room had been recently refurbed and didnt even have an inroom safe which i think is an essential nowadays having said that as a location for universal studios it cant be beaten the neighbouring sheraton is slightly further away apparently both these hotels were once one larger hotel its a sub10 minute walk so if you are in la only for a couple of days and want to maximise your day in universal studios by arriving early before the queues start to build up then this is the;4
we chose this hotel because we wanted to go to universal studios located at 15min driving the pool is nice and the staff very nice and helpful the price is fair but in case ask for the renovated rooms they are the same price but nicer;4
we were really worried when checking into the hotel after some of the recent comments about this hotel but overall we were really happy with our room the beds were really comfortable we always had hot water didnt have any concerns about our safety and the location was really convenient the only negative was the hotel staff were a little unfriendly when checking in and only 2 elevators were working during our stay meaning we usually gave up waiting and instead took the stairs whilst the hotel was a little dated overall for the price we paid and the quiet location we were happy;4
weve been here for 4 nights 1620 may and weve had a really great time room 803 was quite large for 2 people and we also had 2 single beds with the same price of a double room 584 euro toilet was clean and towels were always fresh the room was deadly quiet and all the staff was very friendly and has always gave us a hand there are 2 subway station nearby but no good restaurants anyway i would stay there for my next trip in nyc a great little hotel;4

this hotel was in a nice neighborhood lots of delis and coffee shops around and a short walk to the subway station everyone at the hotel was professional and attentive;4
stayed in the hilton for 3 nights in june hotel is located next to universal studios although perfect location for visiting universal the location is isolated so except for city walk there is nothing to do in the evening there is a metro at the end of the hill which will take you to hollywood blvd in about 10mins we used this twice as we didnt have a car it was fine but if we were staying longer i would def rent a car instead of using public transport in lathe hotel was fine for the length of time we were in la but if we were staying longer i would suggest a hotel closer to hollywoodsunset blvd families with children visiting universal the hotel is a perfect spot also if you dont have a car the cost in a taxi from the airport can be expensive we got a private;4
i made my reservation through hotelscom i booked a metro room when i arrived l asked to change the room but it wasnt possible till the next day the front desk manager switched me to an amazing view room the room has no fridge and no coffee maker its upon request the fridge costs 20 per stay yet they offered it for free since i was staying for 9 nights the only thing is that the carpets and the bed sheets need renovation they are very old i hope the management will consider renovating the carpets as they are not healthy for allergic people other than that i had an amazing stay and would come back again for sure;4
room looks good has all the standard items except for an in room microwave parking garage has decent sized spaces not cramped walking distance to universal studios the restaurant in the building is a buffet style nothing special about the stay though;4

i recently visited new york with my partner and booked into the ameritania for 3 nights right from the start of arriving at the hotel the staff made you feel really welcome firstly the guy at the door julian got the cases and then chris and mijad checked us in it was great to have such a smooth check in after a long flight the other staff i encountered were also helpful and had recommendations of places to eat and see only down side was that the room was a little noisy but then again itâs new york and youâre a stones throw away from all the main sights the room was tona good standard and the bed was comfy bathroom also good thanks again for an enjoyable stay;4
we booked this property because it is close to our sons apartment knowing that it is not exactly in the center of all the action we did not expect much we were very pleasantly surprised the metro bus is right outside the door and the subway is a couple blocks down the street 3 stops take you right into the heart of hollywood and the walk of fame no traffic or expensive parking fees the hotel can also arrange transportation to other sites the immediate area is not for tourists this hotel seems to be renovating in phases but in 5 nights there we never heard anything so it does not all look consistent but the service is very consistent always friendly and accommodating we booked the junior suite on the third floor looking into the cutest tropical courtyard with;4
the hotel is located right at the hudson river end of jane street be aware that there are stairs to negotiate to get in the front door reception is decidedly old world with tiles floors that have seen better days and a small desk area which can service 2 guests at a time our room was on the second floor reached by a rather ancient elevator the room itself was spacious and well equipped the bed was a generous king size though the mattress left something to be desired as it was heavily ridged down the middle room fit out included a small work desk and a cabinet housing a mini bar and some storage the bathroom was serviceable though there was only a single vanity and nowhere to put toiletries etc the staff were great while there is a downstairs breakfast area when;4
my husband and i stayed at the empire hotel in june for our annual ny summer weekend the hotel has a very modern feel with a busy lobby bar where we started and ended almost every evening there is a roof top pool with great views of the city and the concierge was very helpful with dining recommendations and theater tickets the hotel is across the street from the ny ballet and in walking distance to wonderful shopping and places to eat we would stay here again my only complaint is that the spigot on the bathroom sinks is wrong for the shallow sink so everytime i washed my hands i got water all over the place;4
love the neighborhood so will likely stay again a complimentary bottle of water instead of a 750 charge would be nice also i believe we were charged for internet service so i might ask about that before staying again;4
location is ideal for attending lincoln center events and visiting central park location is also a 2530 minute walk or faster subway ride from the theatre district found room to be quiet late at night we were on the 8th floor notwithstanding the location on one of our prior visits to the hotel there was an issue that we noted to hotel management to their credit they responded promptly and along with an apology they offered us a complimentary night on our next stay in a one bedroom suite given the location and how responsive management was we plan to stay at the hotel again;4
the hotel was a 5 min walk to the universal studios front gate also a short lyftuber ride to the hollywood bowl warner brothers studios griffith parkobservatory and the hollywood comedy clubs we had a very quiet stay on one of the upper floors great sound insulation the breakfast included with the executive floor was excellent good variety of fruit muffins pastries cereals yogurt cold cuts lox mini bagels or toast juice and coffee for 10 more you can upgrade to a full hot breakfast or get a 20 credit to order off of the menu waitstaff was very helpful;4
anyone coming to the jane for overthetop luxury will be disappointed but if you like a little bit of quirk at an affordable price its a pretty great place i just spent three nights at the jane while i was in town visiting family the rooms are absolutely tiny but i never felt claustrophobic the shared bathroom was never busy and it always seemed like it was being cleaned this is a good thing the first thing i do in a hotel is check for b u g s and was delighted that there was none of that the staff were helpful and friendly and the location was great far enough out of the way to be quiet but close enough to be convenient i think the only thing i could suggest is a single serve coffee maker in the room not having a cup of coffee while i was getting dressed;4
stayed for one night this past weekend for a wedding pros good location room and bathroom clean and spacious bed was very comfortable negatives elevators being repaired which is definitely an inconvenience as the wait time was long especially for being part of a wedding multiple trips are being made up and down from rooms to ballrooms to move stuff around and it was definitely a hassle to wait for such long periods of time also walls are very thin we were next door to a family with young children could hear them playing crying and running around and hear the parents talking to them called the front desk their only solution was to have security go up there but there is no way to keep a baby from crying from all the time and i dont expect that;4
i picked this hotel for my stay in nyc because of the history it holds and the art deco design the lobby was smaller than i thought it would be but was impressive all the same the staff at check in would friendly and let me got up to my room before the normal check in time the rooms are smaller like in most nyc hotels and were probably used as offices back when it was built i had my own thermostat and actually had a pretty nice view out the window the water pressure in the bathroom was amazing and there was plenty of hot water my only complaints were the carpeting in the rooms and halls were old and a bit nasty and the halls were extremely dim they need to do a few renovations to make the whole experience top notch;4
we stayed here while assisting my daughters move to new york city it is a great location and very accessible to the subway system the staff is very helpful and courteous we would definitely stay here again;4
the ameritania is mere blocks from time square theaters and convenient to the subway the staff are exceptional doormen are friendly helpful and looking for ways to make your visit to nyc and their hotel the best keep your eyes out for jeff at the doorhell take good care of you the rooms and lobby areas could use some updating but our room was always clean with towels and toiletries restocked very reasonable rates for this location has become my go to in nyc;4
aside from a great hotel kudos to your customer service team mariana mwas fantastic she greeted us when we checked in and made sure that we had a great stay the hotel needs a team of marianas;4
we travelled in a group that occupied six rooms five we up to standard whilst one was best described as a dog box too small to be let as a doublerooms were clean and comfortable except for the one mentioned location was good with metro only a 3 minute walk away universal studios was only 3 stops an going the other way the hollywood walk of fame was again only 3 stops one member of reception staff michael was very friendly and helpful whilst another gisel h was very unfriendly and not helpful at all despite her i would definitely stay there again also there was a nice courtyard to get together and relax;4
stayed for 2 nights in july chose this hotel primarily for its location to universal studios on arrival swiftly checked in by friendly staff given a room with a fantastic view of universal our room was 2 double beds spotlessly clean rooms are large with plenty of storage space beds were comfortable decor of the hotel is probably getting a bit dated but isnt a problem daily housekeeping was good cleaned and restocked the room well ac worked well and wasnt too noisy also there is a fridge in the room which came in handy breakfast buffet was good with more things to choose from than you could possibly eat there is a shuttle to universal studios every 15 minutes or so but it only takes 10 minutes if that to walk so not really sure why you would wait only;4
the lobby is quite pleasant and modern free wifi is available in the lobby the room was in good order and reasonably clean the top of the mini fridge was pretty dirty though the bed was a good size for 2 people and very comfortable lost 1 star as our aircon unit broke and leaked water all over the floor while we were out the hotel sent someone up promptly and offered us another room they also offer a free breakfast but the choice was so limited we didnt bother with the breakfast we were on the 12th floor it was reasonably quiet but still the usual street noise from the city the staff were friendly and the door was mostly manned jeff took our bags out when we left;4
my partner and i stayed at the empire hotel from 3032014 to 10032014 the room was clean and a good size for new york the location was brilliant with the lincoln centre and central park within a few minutes walking distance there was a starbucks beside the hotel which was very handy as well as a convenience store times square is a 15 minute walk from the hotel the hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming we didnt use any of the hotel amenities as it was our first time in new york and we basically just used the hotel to sleep in but the bar looked good and very busy i would recommend the empire hotel but i probably wouldnt stay again as new york is too big a city to stay in the same hotel twice;4
i enjoyed the hotel at every turn it pleasantly surprized myself and my wife we expected something more dated but really it was a great hotel well decorated good rooms slightly smallish we felt could have been 3 feet wider wide hallways secure parking marble floors throughout ground floor quiet court yard great for reading the staff was great and i connected well with ekaterina who showed professionalism enthusiasm and went the extra effort to explain policy and any questions i had the only complaint was the excessive cost of parking 22day which brings up the overall cost of the hotel so add this into your hotel estimate;4
yes itâs dated butits very clean and comfortable as well as affordable also safe they have security posted 24x7 in the lobby and donât let anyone enter that does not present a room key i picked this hotel because of its proximity to penn station had an early morning amtrak train location was perfect and our room had 2 bathroomsthat was great excellent value if you donât care about modern updates and just want a convenient safe clean comfortable and affordable hotel in manhattanthis is it staff were helpful as well;4
stayed here for my birthday weekend didnt realize what a great location this was till i got there there was some construction going on while there though that distracts from the exterior almost anything you need is within a reasonable distance shopping herald sq macys sports madison sq garden movies amc 34th st food and also easy access to the subway the tick tock diner open 24 hours is within the premises and offers decent meals i think the staff for being a very busy place were always courteous the room was small but manageable and overall i had a great time here;4
this was the largest room ive ever had in new york a small sitting area and large bed made my stay comfortable the room was clean and had modern conveniences staff was pleasant and helpful finally a great location w proximty to lincoln center several restaurants fordham and john jay universities;4
stayed in this hotel for a few days as part of a business trip at the airport so chose it mainly for its convenience of being right at the airport although you could walk to it from a terminal the free shuttle service runs like clockwork and it doesnt take long to go around lax lax is know for its incredible car traffic but getting to the hotel was quite fast during rush hours as there is a road that sort of parallels the main entrance to the airport and gets you in quick plus the hotel is about 15 minutes away from the beach and its nearby towns like manhattan beach so you can get away from it quickly for a complete different scene the room was spacious clean and on the modern side overlooking the runways with nonstop flights in and out the hanging lamps by the;4
a welllocated hotel for the times square area being at 45th and broadway you are close to but not in the center of the activity i was staying in a deluxe queen room which was very clean and wellappointed comfortable bed cover pillows and linens contemporary bathroomshower i didnt see any restaurant or bar in the hotel itself but hardly an issue with all of the bars restaurants cafes and street vendors in the immediate vicinity close to public transportation my impression is that this would be a better choice for the solo traveler or couples rather than families with small kids;4
we stayed as a family of 4 in the hilton universal city for 3 nights in august the hotel was easy to get to without having to drive through downtown la the receptionist who checked us in was fantastic and very knowledgeable and welcoming it was my sons birthday whilst we were there so she gave him a voucher to choose an inroom movie which was nice we had paid to stay on the executive level and we were on the 21st floor it was great because the room itself was really quiet but the room itself was a little disappointing perfectly fine and clean but i had paid an extra â£300 to stay in what i thought would be a better and bigger room but to me it just seemed like a standard room not sure what we paid the extra money for i would stay at this hotel again without;4
the hotel is clean and charming the hosts are really nice and you feel more than welcome i will definetely go back again nice swimmingpool romantic little area with fountain and couches the breakfast is included when it comes to order food or call a taxi they taking good care of you well located you are at 10 minutes to hollywood boulevard;4
my room was clean and comfortable rain showerhead great some people in our travel party had issues with their rooms but overall the hotel is great nice location easy to find doorman jeffrey is super kind friendly and helpful;4
you can tell it was updated a bit ago and hasnât quite been updated since fantastic location fun bar overall on the rooftop but donât be surprised if you donât quite get the service youâre expecting;4
room bed were great pool really nice but have to go in the morning sun is gone by about 3pm or earlier breakfast buffet good 28 for adult less for kids parking 28 we parked and never moved our car can easily walk to universal city walk about 10 min uphill a little bit city walk great for restaurants and this light up fountain that kept the kids entertained for at least an hour note lobby is under renovation but didnt impact us at all and the elevators are slow lots of reviews on this we only ran into issues when we were on pool level 1 but they have someone monitoring this in the lobby one of the elevators was out of order nice property;4
we stayed three nights at the hilton universal city our wait time for checkin was lengthy once it was our turn we figured out why the desk employee steven for us took time to explain the hotel and actually talk with us the little personal touch was appreciated we had a king bed alcove room that looked out toward downtown los angeles and universal city walk the couch by the window helped us enjoy this beautiful view the bathroom was huge and i appreciated the additional counter space to accommodate for two people our room rate came with a free continental breakfast that could be used as a credit to the breakfast buffet on our first morning we had the continental breakfast it was plenty to get us going for the day on our second day we used our;4
not the nicest hilton ive stayed in but not the worst either the hotel seems to be in a transition phase lobby is a bit unorganized but i trust it will be hiltonlevel quality whens things get wrapped up i wouldnt hesitate to stay there and may likely again if we travel back to la;4
location very convenient love that i could check in early rooms are a little dated but i was able to upgrade to a suite not the suite i was promised i requested and was promised a terrace they even emailed me a picture but i was happy with the room;4
my daughter and i travelled to this affordable and well situated hotel for 5 days from april 16th to 21st we had a room with 2 large beds at the back of the hotel on the 6th floor our room while dated had the most comfortable beds we slept soundly and with new york being very warm that weekaircon was a godsend the subway was literally around the corner and across the road making travel to times square effortless and fast710 minutes a lovely area to stay in with affordable eateries in particular a lovely wine bar directly opposite the hotel with delicious tapas served in very generous portions a middle of the road hotel but very affordable and my daughter has already booked a return visit;4
stayed for 7 nights upon check in which was fast and simple we were offered the choice of upgraded to a bigger room on the 12th floor we negotiated it for 30 extra per night and would say it was definitely worth doing so the original room was fine but seemed a little small once we had seen the larger one bathroom was clean and big enough bed was very very comfortable cleaners came around 11am everyday no fridge in the room and the only mirror was in the bathroom although i think they would have given us one if we had asked staff were generally friendly and helpful there is only a couple of elevators serving the whole hotel sometimes its no issue other times you may be waiting a few minutes but really its no biggie the hotel is super easy to find literally 60;4
stayed for a couple of nights and thoroughly enjoyed it couldnt be better positioned if you are visiting universal studios superb location hotel very clean and efficient in that corporate way which can be a little clinical lacking that personal touch other than that cannot complain in any way;4
beautifully decorated easy checkin and very boutique feel the room was immaculate and i really loved the thoughtful subtleties fresh rose on the nightstand loaner umbrella refrigerator and separate well stocked mini bar the room is small as expected from a boutique hotel but cozy and bedbedding were clean and comfortable only 3 not so great things 1 room doors slam pretty loudly some kind of hinge to slow them down would be nice 2 our room was on the 5th floor and we heard mechanical sounds that were pretty loud outside i think they were the furnaces 3 the toilet is a pretty tight squeeze and there was no hot water at 1030am all 3 things werent enough to deter me from returning if i paid the same hotwire rate of under 200 per night for a standard;4
gem of a facility in prime location we enjoyed the empire and her charm the rooms are smaller as expected in an earlier nyc hotel but very well cared for recommend avoiding the rooftop breakfast not a god representation of the quality of this hotel;4
this hotel is located in the outskirts of hollywood but yet not far from the hustle and bustle the metro station is only a couple of hundred metres away from the hotel and the metro takes you where you need to go because lets face it driving in la is a nightmare because of the suffocating traffic hotel is nice and clean decent standard decent breakfast and a nice pool area and if you go to the pharmacy next to staples a block down from the hotel be sure to bring your room key and ask for the discount;4
the very cool website doesnt hide the fact that the rooms are tiny the building is the former 1908 american seamans friend society sailors home and institute and the rooms are like sailors cabins when i say small im talking 4x7 max just enough room for a smallerthanusual single bed and space to enter nevertheless its welldesigned with a few drawers and space to stash a piece of luggage below the bed and a shelf above the bed in single rooms to get other things out of the way the historic wood paneling adds character and a wallsize mirror adorns the wall opposite the bed so things arent too claustrophobic there is a window but dont expect much of a view there is a small flatscreentv it would have to be small and flat and the ceiling and;4
the best thing about this property is its location if you are headed to lincoln center this location is tops also accessibility to central park is a plus otherwise the hotel is pretty average for manhattan;4
had a great stay for thanksgiving week room on 35th floor looking west out to hudson river really quiet room 4 of were comfortable and had good sleep in comfy beds after a hard days shopping tv was good and watched some movies loves the old style mixed with modern especially the art deco and so many retained details will definitely recommend a stay here and would stay here again staff very friendly;4
this hotel has lots to love and a little room to improve its undergoing a remodel so it has lots of new beds bathrooms tile floors etc it has a fitness center pool sauna happyhour business center laundry room gift store and best of all a quality hot breakfast where they cook your eggs to order the staff is super friendly and helpful its only a block from the metro so its easy to get there i only have two complaints first the neighborhood is a wasteland with no interesting places to eat or go second there was an artifical fragrance smell in my room from the floor cleaner im super sensitive to smells so this may not be a big deal for most people;4
great location great hotel if the room air conditioning system had worked it would have been a great stay;4
a night before your flight you find the hyatt convenient to the airport they have 24hr shuttle transportation a wonderful gift shop on the premises the food is good for lunch and dinner they offer a lobby bar and cafe type market place there is plenty of staff to meet your needs the room with a view looks out on runway it is quite comfortable with a mini refrigerator flat screen work area and a comfortable bed if you are to tired to leave room service is available to your room the bathroom was functional and pleasantly decorated the surprise was the large pool out back with nice lounges on a nice day you can certainly relax oh nice business center too pretty spacious;4
when i entered the hotel the gentleman at the front desk was very friendly he knew i was from il and empathized with our tough winter as he is from the chicago area he got me to my room promptly and told me that if i wanted to order room service to head to the restaurant right then and go to my after ordering i had just a few minutes left and he didnt want me to miss it i didnt even tell him i was hungry but he offered up the advice of course i didnt do as he asked got to my room and decided i was hungry i called down and he personally went to the restaurant to make sure theyd accommodate me they did great service the hotel is clearly recently renovated in fact i think it may be new to hilton since its la its a little pricier than your;4

great service convenient to lincoln center and its surrounding shopping and restaurants rooms could use a refresh but they are quiet and the beds and showers are wonderful if you have curious kids make sure to remove the adult goodies from the forpurchase tray;4
the rooms are the tiniest ive stayed in if youre not planning to hang out in the rooms it works out well the beds are comfortable and clean the shared baths are also well appointed a highlight for us was that bicycles were available to explore the area;4
stayed 2 nights with day in between spent at universal studios spacious rooms on 12th floor huge comfortable bed pillows tray of fruit chocolates a nice touch no problems with checkin although booking made via internet 7 months in advance la was experiencing a spot of cool weather so on arrival we felt quite cold as the air con was still on booked b b breakfast was fine plenty of choice which set us up for our visit to us at the bottom of the hill which we accessed by shuttle before travelling we considered the front of line pass but decided to take pot luck glad not to have spent the extra as the longest wait for rides shows was 20mins not being a ride person i was bag minder while the others did their thing they enjoyed all but apparently the mummy is;4
easy to get to bright and clean very accommodating front desk and service staff rooms are tiny but comfortable keep valuables with you the neighborhood is spacious and offers a range of places to get food to eat in the dining lounge or for picnicing we will definitely be going back to morningside and recommend it to economyminded friends and travelers;4
we had been very well received by ali at the checkin the room had already been booked and paid over the internet through a swiss travel organisation this did no prevent ali from upgrading us to the junior suite without an obvious reason what a nice gesture we enjoyed convenience of the additional space although the hotel building itself was built long time ago everything inside is modern refubished very clean and tidy with the necessary amenities there is no ice machine on the floor however the reception staf is very helpful to provide it from the hotel bar in general the hotel staff is very helpful and friendly we would definitely use and recommend the place as it is very close to the next subway station the famous musical places on broadway eg wintergarden;4
location location location this hotel is in a great location close to central park broadway shows times square and all other must see spots jeff the doorman gave us great brunch suggestions front desk made the check in and out process very easy and they held our luggage before and after check inout we really enjoyed the 3 monkeys which is literally next door very cool spot with good food and drinks bring ear plugs you will hear the city sounds all night long housekeeping was a bit aggressive and entered the roomcleaned while we were in there after denying services she also entered even though the do not disturb sign was on the door and without knocking;4
we stayed one night at the empire hotel and found the experience a good one the concierge was extremely helpful and patient the room was nicely appointed though the bathroom was exceeding small for 1 night it was tolerable since we were going to avery fischer for a concert the location was perfect we also enjoyed a lovely breakfast outdoors at the smith across the street only one issue to fault the elevators are slow not working well this should be fixed asap;4
loved it my daughter i stayed here memorial weekend and it was perfect my son lives in the city and suggested it as an alternative to the boring cookie cutter hotel experience and iâm so glad he did we stayed in a bunk bed room which was definitely small but we werenât there to hang out in the room so it was not an issue while we werenât quite sure what to expect with the shared bathroom it was no problem at all i think i only saw 2 other people in there the whole weekend the toilets and showers are very private and they have the wallmounted soap dispensers so you donât need to carry soap shampoo with you the hotel was very clean everyone was very accommodating and courteous and we even got a little dance routine put on for us when the doors were;4
staff in this hotel genuinely friendly and interested very helpful and go the extra mile hotel in good position within few blocks of times square 5th avenue and central park hotel decor dated but was clean and comfortable would stay there again thanks to said jeff an mourad and especially to manager matt only down side was th noise of the air conditioning but wouldnt put us off staying again;4
staff and hotel was great great location friendly and efficient staff my only concern is size of room very small i stayed for daughter mother mini vacation and moving out of college for summer close to university;4
the front desk staff and manager were very nice professional and made me feel welcome as a valued guest at this hotel the trattoria bianca has some of the best dinner meal specials with variety the italian shepherds pie was absolutely delicious during our business stay we took advantage of many of the amenities the new yorker would be my number one choice when i return to visit nyc based on prime location classy hotel good food and safety;4
we stayed in new yorker hotel for one week old hotel but renovated it is on amazing location 1015 min walk to times square rockefeller center empire state building etcacross the strees is madison square garden and penn station subway we had an amazing time in ny;4
we stayed here 3 nights as park of our spring break pros close access to universal studios is definitely the selling point all staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful rooms were clean cons hope you arenât hungry here the peets coffee shop is out of any bagels etc by 8am plus they only have 2 people working and it takes forever not good when you are running to the park there is a starbucks inside universal that is a better choice i wonder if the hotel makes the coffee spot so undesirable that you will give up and spend 30 on their breakfast;4
my friend and i was in la from 18th january to 1st february and stayed that time in hollywood hotel service was great room was clean and breakfast is awesome especially personnel which make breakfast omelettes and scrambled eggs are extremely skillful and friendly near by is also griffith park which is really nice to walk and see the scenery;4
we booked this hotel through priceline and we got a pretty good deal unfortunately we needed 2 beds and we were booked for a standard that only had 1 bed gunita upgraded us to a 2 bedded room for free which was great since we did have a lot of luggage the room was not that much bigger but cant complain much since we were upgraded for free all the staff are wonderful especially the hyper flamboyant concierge would definitely stay again but i would make sure to book above a standard level;4
great location had personal touch as not a skyscraper hotel staff pleasant and helpful shower large and powerful bed linen changed daily and comfy large bed room was towards back of hotel was a quiet no traffic noise;4
we arrived late and reception said we had only small rooms left but dont worry we will move you when you are out for the day without us even asking some rooms have no view city view rooms are the best good friendly service and nice breakfast in tick tock diner we loved the art deco interiors but i dont think deluxe hotel travellers would feel at home some great room rates so we felt it was great value for money;4
the service i received at the hotel was the best ive had in a long while at any hotel the staff was so hospitable helpful courteous the food at cafe sierra was superb and the service was excellent i would return to that hotel to stay;4
arrived here on sunday 13th march for a 5 night stay we had a junior suite withv2 double beds in one room plus sofa bed in the other really nice hotel we had one bathroom could have done with another separate toilet as we were 5 but we managed we had a room on 21st floor so had an amazing view of the empire state building hotel itself was very central to all we needed to see with a subway station just across the road the rooms were lovely and clean with lovely crisp white sheets and white fluffy towels reception needed more seating areas as this was a very big hotel with lots of people staying here all in all we had a very good stay here;4
not much at all to fault here rooms are great they are clean and gave great amentities such as fridge microwave coffee machine and free wifi bit noisy with sirens during the night but no big deal surrounding area looks a bit grungy around hotel but had no problems having said that great transport facilties with bus and train stations very nearby i found location quite central great little eateries around as well waba grill was yummy as well as a little open mexican restuarant near train stationbest authentic mexican i ate in the us complimentary breakfast in the morning is a winner all staff i dealt with were lovely would stay here again without a doubt;4
the hotel staff was polite and gracious we continue to visit this hotel because of its cozy location just blocks away from a train station and the rooms with kitchenettes which saves us tons of cash no complaints here perfect for budget traveler needs;4
overall this is a great option if youre visiting universal less than 10 minutes away which makes a day at the park a breeze but to call this a 5 star hotel isnt accurate we did enjoy our stay but for the price expected a bit more i booked the exec stay for my daughter and me improvements needed check in time is 400 but check out is 1100 am what they extended it to 1130 am but seriously any other hotel where i have status will give me at least until 100 pm the executive breakfast included in our rate was okay didnt include hot items those were an extra 10 i ordered a latte from the nice man who sat us at our table the waiter who brought it over told me it was 6 no mention made of the extra charge at the time of ordering note if your child is;4
this is a nice hotel walking distance from the universal studios they also have a shuttle though it is less than a 10 minute walk the rooms are nice i had a corner room though nothing out of the ordinary the staff was very nice and friendly parking at 28 per night kind of steep;4
nice hotel room was clean and fell wellmaintained not a large room but not small like other nyc hotels this is not a luxury place but it is very comfortable clean and good value for money the location is fantastic if youre doing anything in midtown manhattan what stood out was the superfriendly and accommodating staff very impressed especially by majid at the front desk and by hugo the doorman;4

nice hotel in a good location with restaurants attached centrally located in easy walking distance to the empire and time square the bedroom was a good size however the bathroom was small and looks like the original 1920s fittings on leaving we wanted to leave our suitcases for a few hours and was charged 20 5 per item but would use it again;4
if youre going to lincoln center you cant do better locationwise unfortunately our room was very small and far too hot there was very little space on one side of the bed and the heating unit provided heat even when set on cool;4
room was just right for 4 plush and modern restaurant in lobby looked upscale walking distance to attractions would stay again for the convenience to citywalk and studios parking fee internet fee;4
check in was really good fast and efficient and friendly staff too first night really tired so room on the second floor was ok small as advised on here before but didnt expect anything else as i had read all the previous reviews however second night realised that the noise coming from the air conditioning units outside was unbearable and went to front desk at 04am to say we could not sleep there spoke to a male who was very understanding and apologetic he advised us he would get our bags taken to a better room early next day as we were celebrating our 37th wedding anniversary i advised we would be back around 2pm as we had reservations that evening he said this would not be a problem came back around 2pm and spoke to a female at the desk who could not have been;4
the room is smaller than usual for rooms that have king size beds the view of the lincoln center for performing arts was absolutely beautiful the pool on the roof is covered but not heated i liked that the water was cooler especially on a hot new york city day free apples in the lobby you do have to pay for internet in your room but the lobby wifi is free the dual shower head with wand is nice and more than sufficient for a party of two even though it was small it was nice and a great way to stay at a beautiful hotel for a decent price i recommend it to younger couples;4
this was my first ever trip to new york travelling on a budget with an adult son unsure what to expect but found the morningside perfectly adequate for our needs room 306 faced the street through a window with broken frame and other than one area of carpet damage was large and pleasant enough temperatures were high 90s by day and small aircon unit struggled to deal with this but ceiling fan also helped fridge in room was brilliant although kitchenette area severely under resourced no potspanscrockerycutlery despite working oven and microwave room shower and toilet cleaned and stocked daily there was a communal lounge area but we didnt check this out i loved the area a few minutes walk from central park with outstanding deli stores and a wide variety of;4
the coffeeshop in the lobby outrageous pricing ie half a bottle of ordinary white californian wine 42 in california a can of corona 7 and a pepsi3the rooms are nice and spacey and wellequipped with starbucks coffee and a hugh tv screen a warmed pool outside;4
the new yorker is our go to place to stay when we are in manhattan itâs right across from penn station which makes it easy as we travel by train they have a separate desk for wyndham members and they are always friendly and accommodating to us during this stay we were in two room suite with amazing views of manhattan the suites are cozy and very comfortable i do concur that the rooms are smaller than hotels outside of manhattan but that is expected as real estate is at a premium in midtown their rates are very reasonable and their location canât be beat the new yorker makes it affordable to visit there frequently there are also plenty of restaurants within an easy walk including two right in the hotel;4
excellent location staff are very friendly especially jeff room quality excellent very comfortable beds excellent room service couple minutes walk from times square and central park very central location;4
just returned from an 8 day7 night los angeles vacation we are a family of 4 2 daughters ages 20 and 18 from new york we came to get an la experience and wanted an upscale hotel in a safe area and not too far from the attractions we had considered the hilton and sheraton universal rennaisance hollywood hyatt century city and andaz hollywood after checking out each hotel and its location we were glad we chose hilton we carefully planned out this vacation so that we can get the most out of la we flew in from ny on delta and picked up our car rental compact suv from fox carrentals i was pretty concerned renting from fox because i almost always rent from avis alamo and national and never had a problem but the price difference was significant so we tried fox;4

nice clean property rooms comfortable and spacious i like the contemporary look of the guest rooms breakfast was also very good customer service was a real flipflop depending on who you talked to some at front desk were very helpful and others just plane rude if it werenât for the few jerks iâd give this property a five if you have a car prepare to have to pay 27night for parking;4
good hotel at a great location the staff was very helpful the only negative i found was the 14 per day parking fee but i guess that is ok for la i would recommend this hotel and would stay there again;4
location is right by penn station which is fab for transport itâs also close to the empire state building the hotel has 3 restaurants a 24hr diner a steak and cocktail place and an italian all are amazing the rooms are small and dated this is what lets the place down disproportionate to the price for the room i felt however when i discussed this with guest services they apologised and sent some complementary wine to the room which i thought was lovely the staff were really nice overall it was nice but pricey then again itâs new york;4
the building is a classical new york city building and so does it shows at the interior where hallways look as if it is in need for an upgrade most of the bedrooms offer lots of space and so do the bathrooms the beds offer good nights of sleep also thanks to the box spring mattresses street noise is unavoidable which suggest to bring a pair of earplugs for the lighter sleepers breakfast was included in our package which was served at the diner waffles maple syrup pancakes and scrambled eggs and this for the five days of our stay is not exactly my idea of a healthy breakfast everything is within walking distance time sq penn station the jacob convention center overall a good place to lay your head especially when youre in need of lots of zzzs to run a good;4
stayed at the hilton purely for the location and that was excellent having the shuttle bus found the rooms a bit tired and old fashioned but beds comfortable check in and staff all very polite and helpful but when asked the transport desk for help with a shuttle to airport they couldnt see past their own transport for a charge of 7080 dollars went online and obtained a shuttle called prime time at a charge of 34 dollars did have room service and the food was excellent we left on the friday evening as they were setting up a buffet in the downstairs restaurant which looked delicious;4
we had a large room with a sofa over looking the highway and hollywood hills noise from the highway on the 21st floor was minimal the breakfast is very good and there are shuttles to the park every 15 mins;4
we stayed here for one night on the executive floor the room had a nice view and was average in size we were disappointed that the executive floor did not provide any special perks no happy hour or such the bed was very comfortable we were on a high floor 23 yet at night we were able to hear very loud music for several hours and late into the night we are unsure if the music came from the hotels ballroom or a restaurantclub by the park entrance we used the hotels shuttle to get to universal studios and that was quite convenient the seafood dinner buffet looked absolutely spectacular including whole main lobsters we wished we would have known about this before arriving at the property we want to return just to dine at the buffet looking forward to our;4
this is a historic hotel tesla used to live here but the age shows in the rooms our room was spacious very quiet 23d floor efficient and quiet ac comfortable bed but otherwise bare bones even no coffee maker the location is convenient to many places the price seems competitive for manhattan id like to specifically mention the courtesy and friendliness of all personnel when we arrived there was a mistake in reservation and we had a room with one bed instead of two id like to specifically thank miguel estã©vez who put lot of time and effort to fix the problem in fully booked hotel the diner downstairs offers good breakfast and other meals throughout the day at very reasonable price;4
after booking this hotel i came on to tripadvisor and read all of the horrendous reviews and was extremely worried about our stay we had decided to book a cheaper hotel so that we could spend our money on great restaurants and clubs and were worried that we had made a huge mistake however once we got to the hotel we were beyond pleasantly surprised i had called the day before to ensure that we had a nonsmoking room and they upgraded s to a king bed for the same price the room was huge anyone on here complaining about the room size has either never stayed in a nyc hotel or apartment the room was about the size of two of my bedrooms when i lived in nyc it was clean and the bed was really comfortable the air conditioning worked extremely well and was quiet and;4
nicely appointed room queen size bed seemed smaller and the bathroom was very small seen bigger on buses very attentive front desk and staff key location for our met gala night out short walk to time warner center for shopping and dining;4
we stayed for 10 nights it was our first trip to nyc we stayed in a superior king room room 243 and i was surprised at how big it was i was expecting a very small room we had a great view of the lincoln center bathroom was small but livable not much hanging space but it was a great size for just two people we were supposed to get free water every day we only got that the first day after that zip i did take it up with reception but nothing was done so we ended up buying our own water when checking out the man at reception was very rude i canât remember his name and then tried telling us we owed and extra 240 fin fees after arguing with him for about 10 mins saying we had actually paid in full a few months earlier he got in contact with reservations and;4
lobby bar areas were great for hanging out with friends fantastic neighborhood is easily accessible with several great restaurants on the same block only drawback was the tiny bathroom in the room but thats just one of the perks of nearly any nyc hotel room;4
second visit to this hotel in 8 months great location for all the sights time square and central park friendly concierge juliano and jeff in particular and staff couldnt help with questions enough only slight downside is the air conditioning unit in the rooms is very noisy and despite the fact ear plugs are given it is a bit annoying all in all would book again;4
ive been around the world and i have stayed in a plethora of bigname fancy overpriced hotels while some were nicer than others ive always had an issue with paying bug bucks to stay in a place when all i really want to do is shower and sleep there i checked around manhattan and the cheapest hotel i could find was in the 250 per night range plus tax which is outrageous i decided to stay at the hotel riverside studios instead for 85 a night i am so glad that i did look its not the four seasons its not the hilton its not even a super 8 in a rundown neighborhood but for the price it cant be beat in my opinion its located at the very end of west 71st street which is a dead end its a totally residential neighborhood and just around the corner is;4
good hotel for the value location was great easy check in and out good premier rooms the housekeeping did not come during our entire stay not sure why but it was okay because we really didnât need it;4
lovely hotel located right next to universal studios and universal city walk our room was very spacious with 2 double beds in it and still plenty of space staff very friendly free wifi for first 24 hours was also a bonus had to wait about 20 minutes for the elevator to stop on our floor when were leaving but that was the only downside and probably because it was a busy holiday weekend;4
pros nice clean hotel with very good service pleasant staff rooms spotless beds very comfortable cons complimentary internet doesnt work the evening buffet at 85person way overpriced for an average buffet even by la standards;4
the good excellent location a lot of great places to eat and drink nearby quirky hotel with a beautiful original victorian bar and ballroom friendly professional staff great value the not so good heating and hot water were a bit erratic during our stay there were three days when the showers were cold and others when the room was stiflingly hot at night and no way of turning off the heat housekeeping was a bit erratic there were couple of days when we needed to ask for towels and for the bin to be emptied as no one had made up the room there must be some people in the building who smoke it wasnt that strong and didnt bother us but the smell might be a problem for others overall though the place still gets a big thumbs up from us;4
this was a great experience great service very nice and helpful staff our room was small but very nicely decorated the hotel is well located and walking distance to moma times square broadway â¦ highly recommend this hotel;4
great hotel staff are so polite and always helpful cannot wait to stay here again this hotel wonât disappoint you the location is amazing right outside madison square gardens perfect location for those travelling to new york for the first time;4
okso super small room but i know that going inand even super smaller bathroom but whatevs the service i just have to rave about how welcome we felt upon our arrival we met a lovely gentleman at check in i forget his name but he wears gucci eyeglass frames we were early 115 pm and he was able to secure a upgraded room that was ready for us he was super personable and very pleasant i saw him again when we checked out and the same congeniality and friendlinessreally nice man thanks for being a cool dude the doorman on duty sunday morning october 28 another super friendly and engaging gentleman another cool dude that was fun talking to i would not hesitate to stay here in the future;4
i crashed here for a few days while my daughter recovered from surgery let me start off by saying hh is clean really clean the floors in the rooms are mopped daily and my room sparkled after every housekeeping stop i felt safe you must have a room key card or be buzzed in the main entrance and the elevator has its own âsecret handshakeâ to get to your floor every staff member was friendly and helpful the rooms are a bit shabby furniture dented walls and doors with chipped paint and my bathroom door did not close completely but iâm coming back to clean because thatâs the most important thing to me good place to stay for a couple of days but i donât know that i would base myself there as a tourist the neighborhood is a tad iffy a hospital district so you donât;4
the hotel is very well located with a range of amenities within a 15 minutes walk form the hotel itself public transport is super with the subway station 66th street lincoln centre been located directly across the way from the hotel times square is approx a 1215 min walk and plebty of bars and restraurtants in the vicinity the room was small in comparison to european standards however it was clened every day clean bedlinen and a range of toiletries supplied each morning the only complaint with regards to the room would be the noise from the sir conditioning outside the window we did complain to front of house and they moved us to a room with less noise however still annoying but better than before staff were helpful and friendly i would recommend this hotel and;4
to end our 5 weeks roadtrip through the us our family of 5 stayed for 4 nights in the new yorker hotel in a family suite on the 19th floor room 1931 obviously this is a big hotel with hundreds of hotel rooms and hence the procedures tend to be a bit industrial but we found the staff friendly and efficient on the upside we have 2 queens in one room and a convertible sofa in a second one when converted into a bed there was hardly any space left and opening the fridge was no longer possible on the other hand this was not a big issue as we spent most of the day outside exploring the city what is a bit deceiving is that on bookingcom there are pictures of a premium double queen suite showing a small kitchen and eating table and a small balcony on top of 2 queens and;4
after reading all comments about this place on tripadvisorcom i thought that i might have done a wrong choice some old comments were speaking about dirtiness in the rooms unpoliteness of the employees and insects everywhere well i must say that i didnt experienced anything like this in the contrary my boyfriend and i were very satisfied with the hotel the room was clean and cosy with a big television hairdryer ironing board and flatiron the only negative aspect was that there were no wardrobe so we decided to put some of our dresses on the open ironing board the personnel is very kind everybody always had a smile for us and was happy to help and answer our questions just something watch out the reception has a very powerful ac in july it was freezing in;4
was very happy with this hotel even given some of the previous negative comments the rooms are a little tired yep totally agree however they are clean the staff were very helpful there was free wifi and times square is only 10 15mins away on the 1 train which can also take you to many other locations hotels in nyc are not cheap and when your travelling on a budget gems like that are worth keeping in mind id happily stay here again and will be recommending it to friends who visit nyc no doubt;4
the hotel has well sized rooms2 queen sized beds and still a lot of space in the room your day will get charged up with a delicious breakfast though they limit only 1 omelette per guest for leisure you can walk in the neighborhood which has nice boulevards vermont sunset hollywood you will love it hypermarts are closeby jons and vons the underground metro stations are very closeby though the metro serves very little purpose in la for a tourist rooms come with complimentary coffee maker to keep you warm irrespective of weatherhope that your stay does not require help of maintenance staff because they lack service orientation free wifi was indeed useful overall good for even next stay;4
ok its a big and busy hotel so the lobby will be full now and again the bell hops busy on occasion and the checkin staff facing a queue from timetotime but in my experience the staff are friendly and efficient with ready smiles our room was way up high something like the 25th floor from memory it was small ny hotel rooms are generally small but not too small for a couple and our 3 cases but it was clean it was quiet and we had an unobstructed view down 34th to the empire state the location is great right across from penn station just down from the empire state and not too far from one of my new ny faves the high line one word of warning which we resolved without fuss while we were there the check in staff tried to apply the resort fee of circa 25;4
this hotel is in a perfect location 1 min walk to the subway 5 min walk to the empire state building and around a 1520 min walk to times square the only bad thing i have to say is that the room we booked the cheapest was tiny so you struggle to fit 2 suitcases in and also dont shower with the door open as the steam sets off the smoke alarm other than that an amazing pizza restaurant famiglia is just across the road customer service from all staff was amazing guy on reception desk was lovely and so was the man who helped with our luggage so all in all a great time in this hotel;4
in the center of la close to the metro 2 blocks great service at front desk excellent breakfast options clean and with nice beauty products really big room everything you may need in a great hotel;4
great location just by whitney and high line interesting neighbourhood as reviewers note its fairly basic but great if you just want a place to crash positives include the really snug bed good cleaning service the really helpful front desk staff the superb views from roof top bar lovely period features negatives the milling noisy youth as you return late at night queuing for the bars only one lift you might have to share it with the cleaning trolley the lack of basin in room i was expecting shared bathroom and have no problem with that but you cant even clean your teeth in the room ac not strong but its very good value for money as long as you go with your eyes open its great;4
excellent airport hotel stayed multiple times great if transiting at lax or have things to do nearby about 30 40 minutes to downtown la check in can be busy at times room is big good soundproofing although walls are a little thin limited restaurants food is pretty good although breakfast is disappointing for example have to slice and toast your own bagel;4
very nice hotel jeff was very kind and helpful and room was good close to the city and good room service i would highly recommend for anyone to come to this hotel if they wanted to stay in new york;4
so we went on a 2 night staycation with my 3 youngest boys they had their 2 favorite things to do eat and swim start with the food large selection including an asian section food was good and plentiful i asked our waiter to blend up some watermelon to make watermelon juice and he happily complied excellent service from our waiter the pool was warm enough for me to go in i rarely swim because usually the pool is too cold it was about 85 degrees another great amenity that they have are cabanas which we didnt really need because it wasnt too hot but its nice to have if you had a large group and get this no charge its first come first served i love that its a great spot if you were going to go to universal studios you will like this property;4
i stayed at the jane on september 20 thru september 27 i would feel itchy at night and didnt know why then i found tiny blood staing and saw two bedbugs that was upsetting i notified management and i saw the exterminator in there that same day the gentleman came into the room and sprayed wit while we were given a diffrent room in the meantime i asked them what company they used because i wanted to inquire how were we going to know the bedbugs were gone they used a company based in staten island called jb the gentleman looked like he knew what he was doing he answered all the questions i asked him in the hallway his name was victor i belive he did great i didnt get bitten for the rest of my stay great job to the jane and jb exterminating and victor you gusy made me feel;4
so our stay was good while i get that it is an old hotel it does need some updating the bathroom was an icebox the draft from all windows was terrible we had to have the heat on full but the staff was friendly and approachable the cleaning staff do an amazing job we were happy to leave daily tip the ice machine on our floor never worked also it would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room the bath faucet spewed out brown water until i let it run all in all iâd give it 910 for convenience to surrounding area;4
the location of the hotel is great its right beside the ed sullivan theater on broadway a few blocks from the heart of times square so not quite as noisy the air con in the rooms was great the rooms were a good size but the beds were a little small for 2 adults and the room could use some extra storage like a drawer by the night stand close to subways and times square and central park;4
we really enjoyed staying at this apartment we felt like new yorkers fairway market is a block away coffee from the street vendor in the morning was exceptional the room didnt have cable tv but numerous street vendors sell dvds and vhs videos for the kids 23 bucks each you have to pay for internet access i didnt like how the check in person scanned my cc i thought it was only my driver license and would have left had he told me he was going to do my cc too the express train stops at the 72nd street subway station so one stop from time square lots of places to eat near;4
as others have said rooms on the top three floors have been renovated and are very nice we had a room with two double beds and there was plenty of space for 3 adults this is not a luxury hotel but the room we stayed in was significantly nicer than a typical days inn room yes other parts of the hotel are old and the elevators are slowthats the downside we found the front desk very helpful and courteous graciela and coral were a pleasure to deal with outstanding location;4
really enjoyed our stay here the rooms were small but clean but bedding nice and good pillows made up for that bathroom small but good enough for the time you spend in there downside there is no consiege which i thought was strange for such a big hotel reception staff quite helpful though would definitely stay here again because of the location penn station just over the road not far from time square empire state and macys all in all a good stay;4
the new yorker was everything we had hoped for except it was extremely busy it makes sense because the hotel is located in time square with the subway station 34th and penn just around the corner when we first arrived at the hotel after our redeye flight around 800 am we noticed a lot of people were standing around the lobby there was a lot of hustle and bustle happening as we approached the front desk we checked in but they let us know we would not have a room until after 200 pm my boyfriend and i were a bit freaked out by this statement because we did not want to carry our luggage around the city the front desk staff told us we could hold our luggage with the bell desk for free she was very nice even though i knew she was stressed and busy and she took;4
probably keep it very clean and very good location services are amicableï¼parking is to be improved thereâs not much option but everything else is pretty goodï¼it is xpå¹´å¾èª¿ for one or two night stay close by the airport;4
pros were that the room was of a decent size and was clean the front desk staff was helpful when we asked questions its in a very central location so its easy to get to griffin park hollywood downtown etc very easily from the outside it doesnt look like it would be all that great but on the inside it really was it was reasonably quiet as well both guests and for being in the city they have a complimentary breakfast that has all of your continental breakfast options as well as an omelet and waffle station the air conditioner wasnt a loud clunker like in usual hotel rooms and kept the room very cold it was abnormally hot in la while we were there the beds were very comfortable overall it was a really great experience and i dont really have too many;4
location was very convenient to the subway hotel is located across central park there are 2 stores nearby where i was able to get muffins bagels etc for breakfast the rooms are tiny reminded me of hotels in europe but for what i paid im not complaining id stay here again the next time i visit ny if you are familiar with the hotels in europe then you will be satisfied but if not then maybe you need to look elsewhere i stayed in a 2 single bed room it was small the bathroom was small the ac was extremely loud but like i had mentioned earlier the location was great and also the price;4
a convenient airport hotel of good standard the room is spacious and well maintained so are the public areas service is friendly and efficient very good breakfast buffet the complementary airport shuttle is a great bonus value for money recommend;4
i was very happy with my stay here i was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews but honestly the only thing i could find to complain about is that the elevator is slow the hotel accommodated everything we asked for we made a mistake when booking and had two consecutive bookings they made sure we didnt have to change rooms and upgraded our room we stayed over labor day weekend frimon we had no problem finding parking literally right in front of the hotel for free our room was clean and comfortable it is in a very nice and safe area right across the street from central park and about 3 short blocks to the subway honestly i expected a lot less for the price this is a great value if i return to nyc i would absolutely not hesitate to stay here;4
a great little hotel to stay when visiting ny the rooms are clean and comfortable small but not unexpected in ny only complaint was the ac was very noisy and the nights were very warm location was just great with the subway only minutes walk from the door extra good is the corner deli right out side the front door only closed for 3 hours a day so a perfect spot for breakfast lunch or anytime really the staff were very helpful too;4
great boutique hotel the lobby resembles a lounge at a night club the room was small but well appointed with attention to detail sundries and minibar in the room had a smart and different selection but extremely overpriced my only complaint was that the drain in the shower must have been slightly clogged and very slow to drain i alerted the front desk at checkout the rain shower was great the lincoln center area is a great area to stay in the city would stay here again;4
easy access to subway hotel clean and staff assertive lovely interior cant complain for the price didnt have a great view but we werent in the hotel much room was always clean and tidy when we would get back from a long day out which was great;4
really pleased with my stay at the jane great for under 100 the location in the meatpacking district is a really lovely neighbourhood with heaps of cafes and restaurants to meet at the decor and the room had lots of character yes the room was small but it was suitable for my needs and had a flat screen tv and safe for valuables the shared toilets and showers was not a problem for me as the areas were kept clean staff were friendly and even saw a few celebrities in the lobby the only negative was that the traffic noise was quite loud during rush hour and i could hear noise through the walls i just used my earplugs which traveller doesnt carry earplugs with them these days;4
my mother and i stayed here in february for a week and have to say overall we thought it was great location is excellent just a few steps from the hammersmith station junction with restaurants and cafes etc but down a quiet side street that made sleeping a breeze at night staff were relatively friendly helpful and smiley and there is always someone on reception 24 hours a day our room was quite a large twin room apparently one of the best in the place according to reception relatively spacious by london standards had a wardrobe fridge and also were provided 2 bowls 2 mugs and cutlery we were able to eat breakfast in our room every morning which was very pleasant rooms are very stark and boring but we only really were there to sleep so it didnt matter for the;4
my husband is a hh rewards member so with a combination of points and cash we took our children for an overnight visit to universal studios hollywood as we are annual pass holders the check in was prompt friendly and efficient and we given our amenity two bottles of water as a nice surprise we were upgraded to a park viewit was a very kind gesture and my children loved it the room was a decent size and clean even in the little spots that sometimes get missed such as the base of lamps and what not that being said whoever prepared the room accidentally only gave us one disposable coffee cup which meant the next morning my husband and i had to take turns getting our caffeine boost and we had to rinse out the cup and share it it was unseasonable cold in la;4
we really enjoyed are stayed they have clean updated rooms the free breakfast is excellent with omlets waffles fruit cereals and muffins ect athe only downside is the 25 dollar per day parking and they have no hot tub we will definitely stay again when traveling to the area;4
i had the opportunity to stay at the empire in early august my sons band was going to play at lincoln center the experience started when i made my reservation and was able to list any requests i might have during my stay just one a room with a view of the street i like city noise on arrival i had exactly what i requested a good start and the stay continued to be positive the staff is excellent the room was clean and comfortable the lobby lounge is welcoming and there is a roof top lounge a wonderful restaurant a pool seasonal and a fitness facility walk out the door and you have lincoln center and several great restaurants plus you are close to central park 5th ave etc there are cabs just outside the door or the subway is a block or so away;4
this is a big hotel on 25 floors or so slightly dated with a small swimming pool and limited facilities the rooms are of good size and clean we didnt use the restaurant as there are plenty of alternatives a short walk into universal city the bar is unappealing with stark light and several tvs running in the background rather than playing music the hotel has a large number of function rooms and gets a lot of corporate business parking is available at 24 per day they charge 795 for wifi access per 24 hours which is a shame in this day and age the minibar in the room was empty the reason why ive given it 4 stars is its location which is a 5 min walk to universal studios and universal city across a pedestrian bridge so if you are going to universal and;4
this hotel is well placed near westminsterlondon eye and many london attractions the rooms are clean and the breakfast is good the only one major problem is the height of the baths in the room very dangerous especially if you are shortalso no grab rail to get in and out of the bath which you find in most hotels this really needs to be looked at;4
this hotel is in a fantastic location close enough to walk to times square hells kitchen and of course central park is just one block away very safe surroundings and has the buzz you want from new york city staff was very helpful and friendly and made us feel welcome rooms were good not great but they were comfortable quiet and clean id recommend this location and hotel for anyone traveling to ny for the first time;4
i was pleasantly surprised by my experience at this hotel i am somewhat jaded as my los angeles hotels experiences have been less than remarkable this hotel is the exception great location within easy 10 minute walking distance to universal studios and city walk checkin was a breeze and the doormen were helpful without any attitude at all the hotel is tall with upper floors eliminating any highway noise below great views too the room was clean as was the carpet nothing to complain about here as it is up to better hilton hotel standards the bar area had a fresh sushi stand which looked great the hotel bar also had an entertaining and talented piano player who actually serenaded my 19 year old son very fun this is a very welcoming propertyhotel i wish more la area;4
hotel was small and lovely recently done up id say an old building with modern amenities room was small with no view but it was modern and spotlessly clean bathroom especially was lovely maid service was faultless it was nice to be on the upper west side you see parts of manhattan that no one else would bother to come that north to see right on the subway lines to downtown and all the sights and literally over the road from central park again not many people venture that far up the park so nice and quiet;4
we were there for 5 nights food in the tik tok diner was very good quickly served and the wait staff were very attentive close to penn station and subways only problem was that the one shower didnât have hot water we had two showers so i could use the other one;4
hotel was conveniently located near the airport rooms were clean hotel staff was helpful and friendly for parking at the hotel seemed at times to be aggravating and the parking was a little expensivealso using the elevator became a little bit annoying having to continuously swipe my room key to change floors or go down to the lobby but the breakfast was really good the hotel is close to shopping malls and casinos which i loved overall this is a pretty good hotel thatâs located near the airport;4
really convenient location with subway station nearby small size rooms but clean good price for new york standards i will recommend to go for breakfast on the dinners around the area instead of the hotelâ´s restaurant as price will be much better overall i would recommend for a stay in nyc great and convenient location to move around;4
the location of this hotel for visiting universal studios is excellent maybe a 5 minute walk which is easy or take the free shuttle the interior lobby is pleasant and they have a nice water refill station we had a room with 2 queen beds for 4 so we got a roll away for our teenage daughter it was nice but not really much room in the room for the extra bed and 4 cases not very easy to manage all the cases in the room provided the rooms were very clean and a nice bathroom the view was great and the kids loved the pool we enjoyed sitting by the pool with refreshments from the bar there all in all a very nice hotel just be aware there is nowhere close like a 711 so you are fairly captive to the prices of the hotel and the nearby city walk if you dont bring in your own;4
we stayed at the new yorker hotel for three nights last month our small room did not have a view but being away from the busy street meant it was quiet the bed was very comfortable but we were disappointed not to find coffee making facilities in our room the lobby was grand but elsewhere the decor was rather dated there was a good security presence near the lifts the reception staff were friendly and efficient our in room safe was not working when we arrived but was fixed within 10 minutes after a call to reception an excellent location for sightseeing and shopping and so convenient for penn station we enjoyed two breakfasts in the tick tock diner which were well cooked and reasonable in price;4
this hotel is a budget option at manhattan but the cleanest one i have experienced so far no bugs in the bedroom and the shower box was always dry and clean i was probably the 1st user in the morning thou the hotel is a historical building with two common genderless bathrooms per floor the standard room is rather small not a good choice for claustrophobics or very largeframe people the frontdesk people were not the most helpful folks your source of information here will be the doormen who were polite and helpful this hotel makes for an interesting stay buildingwise and its location is very convenient 510 minutes from acel subway safe neighborhood a couple of blocks from the high line and across the street from the river front;4
the view from the rooms is amazingthe front desk was very helpful especially pamela who remembered my name and made sure that my stay was comfortable the location is great especially if youll be visiting universal studios which is a walking distance away;4
if you want to feel like a real new yorker this is the perfect place to stay first of all this is not a hotel imagine living in a building with a doorman thats how it is there are actually long term residents its a great location i stayed at a studio apartment with a separate kitchen bathroom the bed is pretty big comfortable the sheets the pillows the comforter were clean and smelled nice there was enough towels for two extra sheets there is a couch huge tv stereo alarm clock good size closet the kitchen is pretty comfy with a table and 2 chairs everything was clean the kitchen the tub the toilet the fridge is small the supermarket is 1 block away on 74th street you can just go buy fresh food everyday you dont have to stock yes;4
great value especially for ny wifi was available for free at the starbucks around the corner why cant the hotel do the same we might have spent more time at the hotel if it was staff was friendly the bar was fun and the location was perfect for met opera lovers;4
my boyfriend and i stayed here the last week of march for four days we mainly picked this place because we got a great deal on orbitz for around 100night the rooms were clean the location was ok even though the hotels parking gate and security made me feel safe its still not an area id want to walk around late at night it is close to the red line metro to get to downtown la universal and koreatown easily and to avoid traffic however you should still rent a car we drove to santa monica and venice beach parking is 22night including tax the best part was the complimentary breakfast the madetoorder omelettes and waffles were fantastic id recommend if you find a similar deal;4
i am a native new yorker but no longer live in the city i was brought in to speak for a conference at a university and they put me in this beautiful boutique hotel due to my lack of planning i forgot my credit card for deposit but we worked it all out the front desk staff however while cordial were certainly snobby i guess it is midtown so maybe its to be expected not sure i know there was no real effort to be very welcoming and i think it was because of my attire but one staff member really went out their way to give us the level of customer service i was expected to receiving at the many hotels i travel to frequently for work his name was ricky he was very pleasant and accommodating he really went out his way to make make sure we were;4
glad we stayed here everyone was extremely helpful and nice i would stay here again the price was a little steap the location of the pool was a little akward but loved that it was heated i liked the shuttle service to and from universal city walk this location was perfect for my visit;4
here the location is everything if you are going to universal it doesnât get much easier and being near city walk is a definite plus the rooms are oversized and clean plus i really liked the built in charger station this was our second stay and the service was much better this time the elevators were improved over last year and i can tell the hotel is doing what they can to keep it moving but they are still slow at times my biggest complaint was the pool it becomes deep quick and instead of being at one end it is deep in the middle for small kids it doesnât work well;4

i spent 3 nights in the posh boutique empire hotel with my friend last week the rooms are quite small for us standards but we managed the bathroom is extremely small and the shower has a stationary glass that goes half way across but nothing to keep the water from splashing out i didnt realize how wet the floor was there is a wall shelf but no counter space at all it is across the street from the lincoln center about 2 blocks away from central park starbucks next door my friend had a class all day so i spent my day walking around the city it was a beautiful chamber of commerce not a cloud in the sky day i loved seeing the families in the parks with their children the carriage rides thru the park seeing the rockefeller christmas tree going up;4
the hotel is located near redline metrostation we went to universal studios by metro and a free shuttle from metrostation no parking fees metro costed usd 150 per person per direction easy access to hollywood boulevard walk of fame the hotel was clean staff very friendly and everything was working fine for those who suffer from noises not to be able to sleep not a good place because there were several hospitals in the neigbourhood and ambulances were loud we took a bus to santa monica pier beach;4
we used this hotel as a stay over after arriving on a flight from auckland the hyatt is next door to the airport and is very quiet for being so close the rooms are recently updated and comfortable room service was prompt in the morning and delivered on time the most important detail that should be learned isthey have multiple shuttle buses that run to airport i have stayed at other airport hotels that i always seem to wait for a pick up and drop off and many times i get frustrated and get a taxi to take me instead of waiting in a lineand waiting for another 20 minutes the hyatt seemed to have a huge fleet and worked on getting everyone on a bus for the morning flights in a very timely and efficient manner thank you hyatt for not making me stand in a line and;4
i stayed for two nights in room 636 my view as of the airport and the giant colorchanging columns i did not have any issue with noise either outside from planes or neighboring guests the hotel had a small restaurantmarket area both provided friendly service and the foodcoffee was decent checkinout was a breeze it offers a shuttle service to the airport but we did not use it as we had a car the hotel is ideal for those visiting loyola marymount college only 15 minute drive but if you want to go downtown it is further out and with traffic you could easily spend close to an hour to get there as well a drive from here to venice or santa monica will be about 20 to 30 minutes my happy moment was a 10 minute walk to the nearby inandout burger;4
the hotel is the perfect location for universal studios and with the metro train close by it is easy to get to hollywood and la the hotel service was very good however my only disappointment was being charged 25 for an early checkin particularly when a room was available otherwise i would recommend the hilton;4
this busy artdecostyled hotel is located across the street from penn station making it perfect for train travelers the staff is friendly and helpful and goes out of their way to resolve any problem that may arise quickly and without question the 24hour diner attached to the hotel is a great convenience for guests who want a quick satisfying meal new york style diners in the city are fast disappearing so this is a glimpse of history as well the new yorker never disappoints;4
have fond memories great hospitable people we had a good time as soon as we checked in were surprised with the room with a view and complimentary welcome note from the chairman along with basket and invitation to chairmanâs lounge for cocktails met with some fine people and our family felt like home possibly one of the best hiltonâs we e stayed with in terms of care and service the property is only 8 mins walk from universal studios and a shuttle service all day long;4
we booked this hotel as part of a package deal to go to the universal studios hollywood park as well as a base for us to visit hollywood landmarks and some of the studios the package included self parking which was a great deal as it is normally 20 a day and it also included two breakfast vouchers per day we are a family of 4 so we paid for two kids breakfast while using the vouchers for the cost of the adult breakfast the room is very clean and we had no complaints we also had a view of the park from our room as well as the mountains the park is about a 10 minute walk or you can wait for the shuttle bus to take you to universal citywalk which comes every 20 minutes;4
i must admit having read a few of the reviews on this site my wife and i were a little apprehensive about our stay at this place however i am pleased to report it is a smashing place in a great manhattan location our stay was excellent value roughly â£60 a night through expedia for a decent sized double room it was sparsely furnished but clean and the bed was comfortable although we did not have a private bathroom i dont think any of the rooms do our room had a washbasin and there were two bathrooms one with a bath one with a shower right across the corridor they werent lined with marble but they werent sickinducingly disgusting either the room was spruced up each day by a maid and we had a small fridge tv and telephone in the room along with a;4

the hotel is inside a compound with gates that open and close which is nice with all the homeless people in hollywood it is a mile or two from hollywood and vine and the highland center there really isnt anything close to the hotel no restaurants or attractions so plan to take a tour taxi or drive the hotel staff is accommodating and jose and hugo cook a fabulous breakfast daily which is included in the cost of the room the hotel is under renovation and the rooms that are finished are impressive the hotel is clean and people are always working on the tropical garden area if noise is an issue ask for a room on the back side or interior courtyard the traffic on vermont can be really loud on friday or saturday nights overall i would stay again rooms are a little;4
the wyndham new yorker was just across the road from penn station so perfect for a short stay in new york when we travelled up by train from elsewhere in usa for a couple of days the subway at penn station also proved really convenient and an excellent way to travel round new york we were on the twentyfifth floor with an excellent view the room was a decent size and we slept really well on a firm comfortable bed the street noise was not a problem at all the room was very clean the staff were very helpful the cost for a double room on expedia was less than â£100 a night excellent for a city centre hotel in new york the additional charge of 20 to the bill the next morning was a surprise because we did not use the gym or the printing facilities in their computer suite;4
so i was trying to have a new experience stay in the upperwest and it was very good indeed totally different from being in soho i stayed in winter or in midtown east spring i was on vacation and wanted the feeling of being on a vacation and not in the busy manhattan so they have a local shops wholefoods and 2 metro stations red line and blue line and a short walk to the central park what else do you need when on vacation now be very honest it is not for someone who wants to shop or tour the city it has not many tourist places around it is more to relax and go to specific places;4

having read a number of bad reviews for the morningside inn and also emailing the manager not receiving a response i was concerned about staying there but i neednât have worried i booked a budget single room and my friends booked a budget double and i asked if we could have rooms on the same floor which was fulfilled we were given 2 rooms on the 4th floor upon arrival we were booked in my friends had a double bed drawers wardrobe sink a fridge a tv in their room my room had a double bed a chest of drawers and a mirror and not much else i enquired about a tv as budget singles were described as having tvâs in all rooms the lovely lady wendy on reception said that there wasnât much that she could do that evening but would see what she could do the following;4

they hyatt is a modern hotel as close as you can get to lax the rooms and lobby are great and there is ample self parking behind the hotel for a reasonable price the reason for knocking it down a star was because a cleaning person came in to clean the room at 430 am this has never happened to me in over 40 years of traveling when i called the front desk they said they would look into it but never called back;4
the hotel is in a prime position to access universal for a few daysit is only several minutes walk to the park or you can catch a courtesy shuttle check in was prompt and the service is wonderful we had a great time watching football during happyhour the room is a good size and the bedding comfortable my only gripe is that someone reversed into our rental car in the car park;4
just returned from a 4 night stay here after reading some horror stories i was a bit scared to check in however it was fine and i neednât have worried yes itâs dated and yes the rooms are tiny but we didnât care about those things it was literally a place to get our heads down after a busy day we were barely there and it did the job the location was absolutely spot on right opposite madison square garden and a 10 min walk if that from times square we couldnât have been more pleased with the location itâs also a 2 minute walk from somewhere that does the nicest bagel itâs called âbest bagel and coffeeâ it was so nice we visited more than once i was worrying about charges on check in as well but as we booked through virgin our tax and fees were included phew we;4

i stayed at the jane for four nights on a recent solo trip to new york and cant recommend it enough to others the room was tiny but i was expecting that and really its new york who wants to hang out in a room here the room was well appointed and clean the bottle of water robe and slippers are such a nice touch it did smell a little funny im not sure what of but i got used to it after the first night my room was nice and quiet and i had no issues with nightclub music even over the weekend it was warm being summer but the fan did the trick i tried using the air conditioner but it was really loud so i didnt bother with it the bathrooms were nice and clean yes there were a few partially clad people in and out of them but it really didnt bother me it is in;4

this hotel was amazing for 34night through lastminutetravelcom wow it was simple accommodations and far from perfect but iâve had much worse accommodations for much more money i was very happy with this choice we stayed for a week on the sixth floor and faced the park it was pretty quiet and we had plenty of light and a nice view the biggest problem was the lack of temperature control we were there in february and the room was sweltering though it was below freezing outside we had to run the air conditioner to avoid burning it up luckily there was air conditioning though it was a little loud and made sleeping a little difficult but sadly this is a problem iâve also encountered at hotels much more expensive the bed was a huge king and reasonably;4
the location of this hotel for is great for any performances at the lincoln center the rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny but its clean and you cant beat the location the lobby bar was fun with locals and travelers mixing well the restaurant on the mezzanine floor was great too;4
pros spacious room for a manhattan hotel views of central park if you have a street facing room two free fiji waters daily daily housekeeping which folds your sweaters or jackets if you leave them on the bed early checkin available and at the discretion of the person on duty they might not charge you for it we arrived 635a the day of arrival and got an early checkin complimentary friendly hotel staff and a doorman that speaks several languages fluently cons hot water for the shower seemed to only be available between 6p and 9p so you have to plan showers accordingly unless you like the cold showers their 1999 âresortâ fee for the internet which is glitchy at best plus the free two bottles of water per day of your stay seemed pretty steep to me i didnât have;4
family of 4 stayed 4 nights in a deluxe room with 2 queen beds nice and modern room and bath everything worded as expected serviceminded and attentive staff above what i am used to on manhattan great location just north of times square did not eat breakfast at the hotel plenty of options in the streets around there couple of suggestions the queenbeds were a bit small also internet in the rooms should really be included thesedays although i was made aware at booking that i would have had to pay free internet in the lobby though and the lobby is very nice and offers good seating to sum up having stayed at a large number of 335 star hotels between penn station and times square over the years this hotel ranks higher than most of the ones i have stayed in so;4
what makes this hotel is the service we ate in the hotel at the chowder house very good food and service the only disappointment was the bathroom very small and shower not functioning thanksgiving day we had scheduled a car service that never picked us up so chris at the concierge desk got us a car that picked us up within a half hour and out to long island on time nice experience;4
the hilton la universal is a nice hotel in a great location about 7 mins walk to universal city the rooms are good and spacious and the hotel is nice in general they are investing and upgrading it but this leaves it a little untidy the elevators are very slow they are upgrading the key cards to rfid and whilst they did drop a note under the door they only gave on key card which meant a 5 min wait for the elevator up find the key was changed another 5 min down to reception then a 15 min queue to change keys then another 5 min up again not what is needed after a hard day;4
we had two nights at the days inn it was central and clean the breakfast they offer was good however a very small dining area but the guests rotate and it seems to work the rooms were spacious and nice the concierge was super friendly and was well informed on nearby amenities it was a a lovely stay all in all;4
i was travelling alone to attend the women in the world conference at lincoln centre the empire hotel was situated perfectly for the conference the room while small which was expected was very nicely decorated and clean bathroom was small and didnt leave much room to move around plus the shower was one pane of glass with a large opening that felt kind of odd worked fine though with lots of hot water and was clean which is most important the bar and lobby were popular places i went to the rooftop bar which was very cool great vibe lots of people there enjoying after work drinks had a martini which was average but the service was decent overall the hotel is very hip well located for my needs and clean will definitely return;4
i stayed twice at the wyndham new yorker hotel and i am quite satisfied for the quality of service and of the room for this hotel in new york i can say the restaurant is so so and every morning is a lineup for the breakfast so you have to go outside but beside that i am pleased with this hotel however i would like to teach people staying at a hotel this is not a community ground and by respect to other people you should close your door properly and not slam it i had two nights at the hotel and i have someone on this floor that first of all decide to talk on his phone in the hallways secondly i have another person i dont know if they were fighting but heshe closed her room door and all the walls shaked respect they dont know;4
our first trip to the usa and we started at la at the hollywood hotel the front staff couldnt have been any more helpful or pleasant we really appreciated their help a few times our room 326 was great very quiet and nicely appointed the only drawback was the hot water in the bathroom was a bit hit and miss we did notify the front desk of this but it wasnt fixed but if that was our only problem we were lucky the hotel is close to a small shopping mall and supermarket transport isnt far away the buffet breakfast was nice but we probably would have enjoyed bacon and eggs the only egg dishes they did were omelettes or scrambled eggs however it was still enjoyable the chefs behind the bain marie were very friendly as was everyone we met at the hotel from the;4
family vacation started with the idea of visiting universal studios and seeing hollywood for two days as the start of a 9 day west coast trip so my search was for a reasonably priced hotel in the area that would accommodate my family of 4 that includes 2 adult children being totally unfamiliar with the area the location was ideal the price was right and the online images sold me we booked one room with two queen beds and checked into room 310 very large room with minrefrigerator and microwave lots of bed pillows and very nice bed linens bath towels were ok room had tile floors small closet small bathroom but plenty of room view was onto vermont ave so not great but could see hollywood sign had no issue with traffic noise hallways were wide and;4
me and my husband stayed here for 4 nightsgood spacious rooms with all basic amenities from toiletries to refrigerator and a microwave in roomthey have all the facilities a swimming pool breakfast and a car rental service in side the hotelthe best thing i found was that they donot charge a resort fee other wise most hotels charge the hotel is best situated about 34 min walk to the metro station which makes the place accessible to all attractions in la about 23 stations away from the hollywood highland where you have walk of famemadam tussads etcand another 12 stations away is universal studios a super market close by which will give you discount being the hotel guest a good experience overalli would also like to mention cecile she is a great lady at the front desk;4
in summary it was a fantastic ten days at a great little hotelâ¦ initially i was rather apprehensive as to the hotelâs quality as we generally only stay 5star but as it was such a great deal we booked it regardless and we were delighted with our findâ¦ the hotel is rather more basic than we are accustomed to but is immaculately clean we had booked a standard room but when we arrived we asked for a room overlooking the park and were upgraded to a larger room room 609 spacewise it was fine â we had two large cases and had ample room for them we had a superking sized bed with a really firm mattress although it was the height of winter we had no need for the heating so did not encounter any noisy radiator problems people have mentioned in other reviews the room had a;4
very convenient location surrounded by restaurants and transportation we had a room on the 23rd floor a little small but still very nice they offer early check in and late check out for a small additional fee which was super convenient weâll be staying here again should we choose to come back to the city;4
just back from a 5 night stay with my family to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday our room was lovely brilliant views very clean too our daughters room was on the same floor but at the other end of hotel they didnât have a view and room was smaller definitely get a room with a view if possible staff friendly and security is very good hotel is in a fantastic location we only visited tiktok diner on first morningâ¦ the older guy in there was very grumpy so we didnât go again so many amazing breakfast places close by we went somewhere different each day as i travel agent i would recommend the new yorker to my clients;4
the location is perfect if you want more than shopping there are a lot of restaurants cultural options the service was very nice mr ze who also speak portuguese was very helpfull the lobby bar is modern and full of people all the time the only negative point was that they charge for the wifi in the rooms only the lobby wifi was for free;4
if you are doing anything at lincoln center this is the place to stay for fashion week it was the hub of activity it has a lovely bar area on the mezzanine and is next door to a stunning rooftop barpool area that has a forever present waiting line to get in only blocks away from a walk in central park columbus circle mandarin oriental hotel and roberts and museum of arts and design;4
my brother father and mother stayed at the empire hotel for two weekends in november generally they liked the service the front desk person zuli upgraded my mother and brothers rooms for free and was particularly friendly and helpful quickness of room service my mother ordered a continental breakfast good views from the rooms especially the suites which gave you a clear view of lincoln center and broadway location next to lincoln center and columbus circle very comfortable beds and an excellent shower not so great for my family not necessarily everyone was the loud music in both bars the wake up calls going off repeatedly and no ice available on each floor my mother mentioned this also a bit of sticker shock about the price but for new york this;4
small but cozy place in upper west side i was there for westminster so it was conveniently located and the online price was pretty good i went in with pretty low expectations as i had never stayed there i was please to be greeted and helped throughout the stay by very friendly door staff and very accommodating desk staff the lobby was very warm and relaxing almost a throwback to another time i ended up with a king room with a view of a small park and lincoln center although it was on the first floor not lobby level i noticed very little outside noise the carpet and wall paprer were kind of interesting choices but very boutique hotel type i thought it was different but cool the room was very clean and the bed was comfortable but low to the ground as were the;4
as with other reviews rooms are small and views not great but you are paying for budget manhattan hotel spotlessly clean fresh towels daily polite staff ideal location with subway only a couple of blocks away only downside is wifi costing 10 per night which is laughable when free in pretty much every cafebar;4
we made a last minute reservation here for us and our two jack russell terriers who knew the hilton took dogs i was pleased that the price of the rooms was much lower then what we were quoted over the phone my husband was working at universal studios and we joined him for his birthday to save him the commute for the day the room was clean the linens were wonderful just enough towels the kingsize bed was comfy we totally enjoyed the pool and a lovely poolside server violet made us feel right at home she brought food and drinks for us and water for the pups it was not cheap but money well spent the ahi tower and the garlic shrimp were delicious the pool was clean and surprisingly quiet for such a big hotel hanging out at the pool with our pups was the best part;4
we stayed here one night because we needed to attend graduation at lincoln center the hotel was fine but im not sure why it was 4 star the bathroom was redone but the shower floor was kind of old and gross the bar in the closet was so high you need a step ladder to reach it the charge for coffee on the room was 3 but the cream is powder yuk i would say stay there if you can book a premiere room under 300;4
just back from a 6 day break after staying here modern boutique style hotel with average sized room staff friendly especially jeff doorman who organised car to the airport our room was clean and tidy but being new york didnt spend much time in it would definitely recommend it as its location is great near time square can be a bit noisy but it is new york;4
my wife and i stayed here whilst staying in new york and it was a great location or our visit with only a couple of issues 1 was the fact that only half of the elevators were in operation although we did receive a letter with an apology although we felt it could have been sorted before with regards to the hotel being full due to the dog show at madison square gardens and a lot of people staying here also with dogs 2 we had a blocked toilet 1 day and i phoned for this to be resolved about 1030 am and when we returned at 645 pm it still hadnt been sorted and we both had to have showers as we were going out to see the eagles at 730 and there was a smell plus poo in the toilet and somebody had picked up our clean the room sign and turned it over to say do not disturb but;4
i understand how this hotel isnt for everyone in a way its more like a hostel than a hotel but personally i really enjoyed my one night stay here i was on the first floor and of course could hear the traffic but it didnt bother me the room was tiny but i like smaller spaces and again for one night it was perfect tiny bathroom sink was kind of adorable great water pressure in the shower i have thick hair so that was a treat the bed was incredibly comfortable and i got a great sleep that night i would have definitely stayed longer had circumstances allowed the staff was incredibly helpful i have medication that needs to be refrigerated and they stored it in their staff room and very nice when i had to bug them at midnight for my evening dose the location;4
i booked this hotel because of 2 reasons it was just across the street from where i needed to go the symphony space theater and also because it was the least expensive i found the location is excellent just less than a block away from the subway station and there are many restaurants around it many open late after midnight itâs also a couple blocks walking distance from central park as soon as i got the lobby was awfully hot because the ac had broke down which hopefully by now they have fixed the lobby does not look very inviting since it looks outdated as well as the elevators which are very old and the hallways are narrow and smell funky however even though the ac in the room is noisy and i did not have a room view i have to recognize the room was very;4
if you want a cuppa teacoffee anytime take your own travel kettle and buy your own teabags or coffee in a supermarket because you will only get them free between 630am and 1030am other than that the hotel was fab especially jeff the concierge;4

second visit staff continue to impress minor issues with mechanical things next to lincoln center and flanked by busy streets but windows kept the noise out well enough for this light sleeper two inside courts little view little noise relatively good value for money this is new york though;4

small room ny so expected room was in good shape although a little musty didnât love the bathroom shower floor was extension of bathroom floor so everything got wet no bathroom counter space mini ironing board was hard to use and flimsy appreciated being able to use loaner umbrella in room since it rained during our trip the decor of the hotel is trendy and nice although they were doing some remodeling in the lobby that was inconvenient rooftop bar very cool great views of lincoln center loved the location for purpose of my trip had to call down twice to request luggage racks bell service and curbside attendant very friendly and helpful;4
overall fine very conveniently located friendly staff as well the pillows however were so soft that laying on them would push all of the stuffing out from under my head leaving it totally flat i kept needing to flip my pillow over all night long;4
we stayed in a bunk bed room for 6 days this month the bunk bed rooms arent en suite so you must use the communal bathroomshower facilities at first we were a bit worried about this but in reality it was totally fine the bathrooms were always spotlessly clean and there were never any queues the hotel provides dressing gowns towels and slippers to use which is handy the hotel itself is old school with a nice atmosphere and the staff were friendly especially the door men the location is really one of the biggest selling points youre far enough away from the madness that is midtown but the subway stop is only a 10 minute walk away on 8th avenue we loved strolling around the local area with the locals the only problem for us was the size of the room two people;4
staying at this hotel and being looked after by the staff is like being at home we stay here when ever in la and will continue to do so in the future if you stay here it is safe and family oriented;4
a fantastic location right in the heart of universal city just make sure they are not testing the alarm systems or cutting power this is an exception not something they do on a regular basis we were informed upon check in too late to make changes to reservations also informed of elevator upgrades they did a great job of assisting people with placing elevator operators for lack of a better term at the lobby floor all in all a very nice stay the hotel is being upgraded;4
this is a nice hotel in a great location within a few blocks of a subway entrance and within walking miles of good restaurants my only complaint is that my shower was missing its door so it caused water to get all over the floor also the tv was not mounted on the wall though there was a wall mount and was instead on the desk which meant there was no desk in the room to work other than that overall it was a good room;4
very happy with our recent weekend stay here we were lucky enough to get one of the refurbished rooms which i requested thanks to ta on the 12th floor we arrrived in the late morning didnt expect our room to be ready yet so we were able to leave our luggage with the bellman and go out to explore the city great having the subway stop right across the street to be able to get all around the area easily our room was ready for us when we returneda nonsmoking room with a king bed pretty small king bed on the refurbished floornice room was a decent size cleanwe had a nice view of the citygreat double shade kept the room dark in the morning bathroom was fine with an array of products make sure to bring conditioner a hairdryer on the;4

good location just up from times square rooms were clean and serviced every day bed comfortable a couple of negatives there werenât any free plug sockets for charging phones etc except in the bathroom so not ideal also no coffee or tea making facilities i know this is probably a british thing but it would have been nice to have hot water to make a drink first thing they did had hot water in the reception but obviously you had to get dressed anyway a minor thing overall we were pleased with the hotel and staff we had a problem with the safe not locking and it replaced within 15 minutes the cascade delicafe just at the corner of 54th8th street was great we went in everyday for coffee and breakfast really reasonable would definitely recommend this hotel as;4
good central hotel with booked parking a few minutes away the london eye river cruise shrek the dungeons tube station very close by and easy 20 minutes walk to drury lane to watch âfrozenâ unfortunately a bit noisy with drunks outside in the early hours of the morning but not inside so not the premier inns fault;4

i just love the empire i stay here a lot when i travel to nyc for business and love it more and more each time i stay the funky chic decor just oozes new york and youre treated like a celebrity the moment you walk in the door im obsessed with the lobbylounge which is great for an informal meeting im not in finance however or a drink after a long day of meetings the staff are super friendly the rooms are very small but so is every hotel room in nyc the location is great and close to some nice restraunts the breakfast at the hotel is good but expensive traveling on my company stipen makes me order very carefully if youre traveling with a group the roof deck is a great place to unwind just make sure youre room is on a lower level tough to get up for an;4
we stayed at this hotel last november on a weeks trip to nyc the hotel was lovely with a real vintage feel to the lobby area the staff were friendly and accommodating everyone we came across was very polite the rooms were not that big but we didnt spend much time in ours what with all the sightseeing so wasnt really much of an issue the facilities were ok it was a little noisy but we expected this being in the middle of manhattan there is a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel also which was nice for breakfast or a 2am milkshake all in all not a bad place to stay in an excellent location literally across the road from madison square garden;4
great location and dean at the front desk was super nice and friendly it was late at night when we arrived and he was a great welcome after a long day my mobile key wasnât working so had to stop by the room was big and quiet but had a slight older musty smell to it it just needs to be updated there was also no mirror in the room only in the bathroom so it was hard to do my hair when others where using the bathroom some of the outlets donât work wonât hold the plug in the bathroom was a great size someone had left a used soap bar in the shower the shower head needs replacing as water was not coming out fully i liked the cafe and the staff was friendly i enjoyed the outside courtyard;4
we stayed here for one night as a stop over to meet up with a cruise the following day i and my family could not fault the hotel the room the view or its location the only let down was the facility charge that we were not informed about we had no knowledge that we would be charged this fee for a service that we did not use when we booked in we should have been were of this charge you pay a fee for a service you do not use;4
iâll start by saying i found absolutely nothing wrong with my stay its an older hotel with great location and a good value its an older property things are kept up but you can see the age on them its clean but weathered thereâs nothing fancy about this place;4
location great overnight parking ridiculous room is pretty standard with refrigerator hotel appeared clean and well maintained shuffle to airport is great but shuttle staff borderline rude hotel food is ridiculously high considering i saw no grill;4
stayed here for 4 nightsrooms are small but the bed and shower were perfectroom had a good view and also had a safe which is handyno teacoffee facilities but there is a small coffee shop in the lobbyexcellent location and right next to penn stationideal for getting in and out from the airport;4
we stayed here on a recent trip to la we found the hotel to be great our first experience was the reception staff who were consistently brilliant throughout our stay they were courteous friendly and approachable nothing at all was too much trouble as first time la visitors they really helped us orientate to the city and shared some top tips the room was clean comfortable and spacious it seemed a little cold when we walked in due to the laminate flooring however we have absolutely no complaints and who goes to la to sit in their room anyway we had a room that overlooked the courtyard we didnt ever manage to visit it but it looked lovely on an evening breakfast was included which consisted of a great variety of foods including the usual cereal;4
i checked into the empire hotel on a tuesday night for a night out with my girlfriend the hotels presentation is gorgeous and we got an excellent price with the aaa discount location is perfect right across the street from lincoln center and a few minutes walk to columbus circle the concierge was very helpful as i asked for a bucket of ice and wine glasses and they delivered them immediately what i loved most about this hotel is the night life around 8pm or so the lobby and bar morph together into an awesome social atmosphere where guests can enjoy there drinks throughout for added space the stairs lead up to the mezzanine level where high standed couches decorate the floor with plenty of spacious and private seating to enjoy with your significant other i checked into;4
the jane is a like a glorified upscale hostile i dont need much space because im usually just there to sleep and in ny you dont do much of that either and just want an easy access hotel with a room that i feel safe and clean the jane was perfect not only was it kept clean on a routine basis but the restaurant and lounge are great places to eat relax entertain very cool and unique hotel experience and very reasonably priced compared to what else is out there;4
location excellent for subway especially if you work out which access to use also easy walk to times square or amtrak rooms are nice we were lucky to be given a larger one staff helpful unfortunately i think the double bed was smaller than average;4
we usually stay here just for convenience the hotel is comfortable clean and a great location butout dated and seems to be overpriced i think just due to the name hilton if there were more reasonably priced options nearby we would probably stay at a cheaper place;4
business trip to lincoln center great location nice common space reasonable but smallish room clean very nice staff there is so much potential for access from this location and nearby shopping is great;4
our room felt very small at first but eventually that didnt bother us it was also clean but a little bit out of date the location of the hotel is really good however there is nothing to see in the neighbourhood but the metrostation is really close the staff was really friendly and you could ask anything from them the breakfast was pretty good and there were always lots of things to choose from plus there was staff who made you omelets of your own choice which was great i you are thinking of renting a car in la i would also recommend the company which was inside the hotel all in all i was pleased with the hotel and i would definetly stay there again;4
for those who want to visit universal studios in los angeles this is the hotel you can have a nice walk to the entrance plaza or take the shuttle rooms are large and well maintained the alcove rooms are the best other than the suites very good breakfast buffett with extensive choices on weekends they have an astonishing dinner buffett with an emphasis on fresh shellfish the front desk people are friendly and efficient also for those who prefer not to drive everywhere and the bottom of the hill there is a subway station;4
we highly recommend this riad we stayed 4 nights and were treated so well by the entire staff who are willing to help with any problem guests may have as we arrived valentina provided us with important information and asked about any dietary wishes or problems the kheirredine is simply a little gem it was a relaxing place to come back to after a full day of being tourists the rooftop terrace is something everyone should take time to enjoy the light in the morning can be very good for taking photos and one evening when we returned to the riad we had tea on the terrace relaxed and took in the night view of marrakech magical;4
this is my favorite hotel at lax completely refurbished closest hotel to the airport good and friendly service nice modern rooms good lobby with a nice bar and restaurant and reasonable price highly recommended;4
reading reviews of days hotel we really expect find something between average and terrible but our experience was really nice of course you will find better hotels in other places for the same budget but remember this is manhattan the location is fantastic just a few steps from a subway station great neighborhood good restaurants nearby and above all three blocks from mid central park if you want just a fine place to sleep after a long walk in new york this might be your hotel the hotel staff is efficient and helpfull room and bathroom were clean and the beds are comfortable if you forgive a noisy wooden floor which the carpet hides the freak elevators and you donâ´t book a hotel to watch tv we strongly recommend it ps no bugs at all;4
the hotel is accessible to train stationbus stop you can buy food outside especially if you are a filipino and missing the filipino foods there is a filipino resto pointpoint which is near the hotel the staff are accommoding special mention to ms cecile eugenio who is always there to assist us with regards to places to visit and how to get there shuttle services and other stuff good breakfast and internet connection will be back here if given a chance;4
there are mixed reviews about this place but it wasnt as bad as what some people wrote it is well priced especially for us 5 breakfast is great everything is clean you can get food delivered to the hotel from outside food places the gym is good and we felt safe all the time there are a few inconsiderate people who do choose to smoke in the hotel bu that wasnt everyday there was one in particular lady at the front desk who was always helpful we enjoyed it and its only 10 minutes away from the real hollywood we enjoyed it;4
we had a room on 25th floor a corner room with 2 windows and a hudson river view room was small but adequate for my daughter and myself bed was comfortable but very high bathroom small and needed updating no tea or coffee in room but we took our own travel kettle and coffee we ate in the tick tick diner which was good all staff were helpful we had a fab break and would stay there again;4
the empire is a great little hotel with a lot of history and its smack dab in the middle of lincoln square check in was a breeze and the rooms are modern and functional everyone at the front desk is extremely pleasant and helpful with a major shout out to mr ze for the upgrade i have to point out that my job had to put everyone up for the night because of a snow storm but my stay was so enjoyable i felt compelled to finally sign up for trip advisor just to give them a positive review you probably cant find a nicer bunch of people in any lobby in the city;4
thoroughly enjoyed the trip and the hotel was excellent be careful of the prices of the food in the room but other than that i have no complaints ac made the room nice cool shower was lovely and the maids kept the room spotless;4
stayed 12th to 16th no complaints everything was ok would stay here again but hopefully on a higher floor as the air conditioning unit outside our window at the back of the hotel was very loud and had trouble sleeping i developed a stomach bug while there but it was nothing to do with the hotel great staff too very helpful;4
we stayed 10 days at the hotel we are totally satisfiedthe staff members gisel jessica cynthia hugo and juan that we had a chance to deal with were very friendly and very helpfulthe beds were very comfortablegood air conditioningwe slept very well during the whole stay great breakfast included in the morning what a great way to start the day the hotel is located at 5 minutes from the nearest metro station and a few stations from the main attractionsthe only thing that i think that was missing was to have a morning paper but then again it is not something that bothered me that much i would strongly recommend this hotel and would stay at the same location if i were coming back to los angeles;4
hugo was the chef omelette was perfect and i also enjoyed the blueberry waffle there wasnt much fruit or yogurt but he was very friendly and i will certainly enjoy another meal here soon thank you to your friendly housekeepers and front desk staff too;4
nice rooms great breakfeast buffet the chef hugo will take good care of you he is a star speak spanish english french japanese and makes the best omelets very well located if youre going for touristy trip swimming pool is of decent size and pictures are pretty accurate;4
the double room was good size the bathroom was roomy and comfortable and clean the onsite food was good but pricy best to go to the city walk or door dash walkable to universal studios and has a complimentary shuttle pool was well used and a bit dirty late in the afternoon a bit unkempt for the price of the place parking is nearly 30 a day for self park;4
astor on the park was a great place to stay for people visiting the city it is cheaply priced for nyc located across from the nw side of central park in a safe neighborhood and was generally everything you would want for a stay the bedroom and bathroom were clean the bed was comfortable and the accommodations were european very compact and just what a person or couple needs to shower sleep and dress for touring it is not luxury but if your luggage remains in a hotel room all day while you are out exploring this is the place for you very quiet and located 35 blocks from a subway station i thoroughly enjoyed staying here for my first nyc visit the front desk staff is a little cold but the cleaning service through the day was great;4
iam from brisbane australia this is my opinion of hollywood hotel clean and fresh rooms cleaned daily good shower we all know how we love a good shower clean fresh linen and towels breakfast is not 5 star but its ok the toaster is a nightmare takes so long to toast the location is good 10 15 mins from most attractions train station across the road 175 to walk of fame about 3 or 4 stops and it drops you off in the middle of walk of fame strip nokia centre universal studio griffith observatory 1015 mins drive we used uber taxi service you got to download the app they are very very efficient u blink and they there to pick u up the shuttle from the hotel cost 79 per person to disneyland we paid 25 with uber on a sunday morning la traffic is crazy the;4
i really enjoyed this hotel because of the close proximity to the train nice restaurants and central park hotel has comfy beds nice rain shower and fiji water is provided i walked to the met walked to central park and walked to the mall nearby the rooftop was a nice discovery on my last night here i wish they had told me that upon arrival it is a nice place to have a drink and hang out overall a great experience;4
we had a 2 queen bed room decent room for 4 people bathroom was large and we had lots of shelvingcloset space for storage clean and lots of covid procedures in place we did find that the lack of housekeeping was a little bothersome after 3 days you can call for garbage pick up or more towels we found this out a little late parking is onsite but is an extra fee just fyi super close to universal less than 5 min walk which we found handy to go for dinner at city walk or take a break from the park beds were firm and lots of pillows on the beds preference we like lots of pillows overall we thought the hotel was great with a fabulous location also the restaurant is well rated and very busywe didnt eat there but the breakfast buffet looked good;4
this is a very good hotel in a fantastic location easy access to penn station and subway times square is only a 10 minute walk plenty of dining options within easy walking distance rooms themselves were tidy and reasonably appointed only minor complaint would be the shower head it is like showering under a pressure hose with inconsistent temperature aside from this an excellent stay;4
we chose this hotel because of its reviews on here and we are pleased that we did we stayed for 3 nights as we were going to universal studios for halloween horror nights and knowing that it was likely to be a late night we wanted somewhere a short walk away and this fitted the bill perfectly from check in to check out we were met with friendly smiles and nothing appeared to be too much trouble the room was large and comfortable with great views over universal studios and hogwarts should we be in the area again we wouldnt hesitate to stay here;4
staying for business in oct 2017 as hhonors member was able to pick out room ahead of time and got an 18th floor corner room oversized and very nice decent gym although two treadmills were broken one thing about the digital key when i got to hotel there was a long line to check in and no separate queue for hhonors members so i tried to use the mobile app to get the digital keymobile room access and bypass the checkin this failed miserably i asked when i got to the desk they tried to set it up but it failed again this seems not quite ready for prime time;4
stayed for 4 nights in december and decided to upgrade to a renovated view room the room was comparable to a london hotel room in size but plenty big enough for the 4 nights with decent size tv and coffee machine the view of empire state building and msg were excellent and added to our the experience of our first visit to nyc the hotel staff were friendly and professional at all times however the housekeeping team slightly noisy early in the morning convenient location for times square macys and other nyc landmarks would stay at the new yorker again;4
only problem i have with this hotel is there are no free wifi in the rooms which is unusual location is absolutely fabulous bang in the middle of times square with plenty of restaurants coffee shops local supermarkets around my room view was not particularly nice the windows were quite dirty and just an old building block but that didnât bother me too much doormen jeffrey and another guy which i didnât catch the name of but works the morning shift are both fab guys who are very helpful and polite;4
rooms were very clean comfortable and room service was outstanding location was convenient to the attractions we wanted to visit only complaint was the price for hotel guest to park our cars daily and having to valet your car during checkin and checkout;4
my husband and i stayed at the hilton los angeles universal city last weekend i had previously booked a room at the sheraton but switched to the hilton based on some recent poor reviews regarding construction im so glad i did we had a wonderful room on the 21st floor overlooking the hollywood hills we took an uber from union train station 16 we were there for two reasons universal studios horror nights and the depeche mode concert at the hollywood bow the hotel offers a shuttle to universal studios but it s really not necessary its less than a 10 minute walk to the front gate the next day we took an uber 10 to hollywood and highland and visited the hollywood museum and the museum of broken relationships had an early dinner and then walked to the bowl;4
the staff were lovely and check inout was easy room was nice and spacious had everything that was needed toilet wouldnt flush however would recommend as long as you dont mind a long walk from the centre it was nice to be away from all the crowds though;4
staff were welcoming and very helpful comfortable bed but the room was too hot bathroom was tiny but the shower was hot and powerful hotel needs a fresh coat of paint great location but the street could get noisy barrestaurantproducts in the room were overpriced;4
the hotels team are awesome beginning at front desk during check in to them again to checkouthotel goes on very recommendable besides the am themesadded to localizatios and staff supportbut again some maintenance problems must be improved to get a excellent status for overall in this stay the elevators showed us some problems but nothing that can jeorpardize their goo status;4
im from the south and demand to be treated as if i am the only customer you have and it was just that we arrived at 1p and was able to check in immediatley we even got to look and pick which room we wanted the man at the door brought our luggage up immediatly my friend and i wanted to hit the town but we needed a little help getting to subway and a few other places the employees at the astor were more than happy to answer questions tell you which way to go and give you all the info you need i must say i felt like i was at home with all the hopitality the price is awesome for the fabulous room and the great sleep i got on the comfy mattres if you are looking for luxury you find it here this place is simple clean and everyone is at your becon call having stayed;4
this is the first time ive rated a hotel favorably almost solely for the location but here it is what a fantastic spot right next to penn station staff were friendly although checkincheckout was a bit arduous with a long wait the reception area was lively at all times of day and the hotel is very easy the spot the room itself for manhattan standards was acceptable downsides including next to no counter space for toiletries in the bathroom and everything was just a smidgen run down overall from broken elevator indicators to worn carpetingoffice chairs wifi was goodacceptable throughout our stay we had a view of the empire state building from our room which was not quiet at all but still within acceptable limits so that was a welcome sight we would stay;4
had a great stay here with family the rooms are fantastic and the staff were extremely caring to ensure all our requests were met the food also was delicious we will most certainly stay here again soon;4
clean room the best bed and linens ive ever had in a hotel friendly staff we had a very comfortable stay plus its directly across the street from universal studios so you basically walk for 5 minutes and youre there;4
we arrived at the hotel an hour early and were asked we had to wait so we ate the hotels restaurant ordered a club sandwich and calamari it was nice went back to front desk and the room is still not ready i was pissed off having jetlagged and travelled 145 hours all the way from new zealandbut in return we got free breakfast nice room and i like how the manager handled everything very close to universal studios we will be back;4
excellent stay here great location in the centre of new york loved being able to walk to times square in the evenings and central park in the day my friends and i all enjoyed the room which had a lovely view thank you to jeff;4
the location is good for access to hollywood and the valley great location if uni studios is your destination its nice having the restaurants at citywalk within walking distance the hotel is pretty whatever competent but not inspiring the decor is very 1980s wallpaper looks old furniture works but theres no sense of style exec floors have many bguys there with families and kids taking advantage of typical hilton clevel carb breakfasts this is my fallback hotel for la if things go bad somewhere else showers work internet works parking is adequate;4
my husband and i and my brother and his wife stayed here for a night in march this year we chose the hotel based on its location and when we booked online it seemed like we were getting a great deal we paid a little extra for a room with a view over the 20th floor and we had a view of the hudson in the distance and some nearby buildings the room was fine a little dated and basic but comfortable and clean my brother and his wife had issues with a blocked sink and toilet when they got to their room but this was quickly resolved by staff the location of the hotel was perfect right beside penn station and madison square garden the empire state building macyâs and times square were all within walking distance one thing that surprised us all was the actual cost of;4
stayed at the new yorker for 2 nights on quick visit trip to see 2 shows and give my daughter a taste of new york we arrived at penn station and left by penn station so having that right next door was perfect the hotel is beautiful and the room was perfect for us it was very convenient to have the tick tock cafe right there for breakfast in the mornings it is in walking g distance to times square and easy access to metro pricey but it is new york;4
the hotel is very conveniently located 1 block from penn station usps macys and bh photo lots of tour groups here so the lobby is always lively gym is quite big and well equipped much better than many other manhattan hotels rooms are small but average for manhattan toilet too close to wall making it a bit uncomfortable for those over 12 wifi free and good 2 restaurants on premises i tried tik tok a diner type place good food and service;4
we had a great stay at this hotel for five nights the room was large and had a couch sitting area desk hallway separate bathroom and view of universal although we were facing the 101 the room was totally quiet and you would never know a freeway was right below staff was wonderful and always helpful the continental breakfast that came with the room was delicious the only issue we had was the inconsistency between waiters at the restaurant or lounge we had vouchers from hilton and each waiter explained the deal differently or delivered a different meal each time we did not visit the gym or the business center so cannot comment as others have in their reviews our room though was full of electrical outlets which was a terrific benefit since we have phones;4
had the chance to stay at the hilton universal for the second time and this hotel does not disappoint it is conveniently footsteps away from universal studios you donât even really have to take the shuttle to universal unless you have small children or elderly trust me it is much faster to just walk we stayed in the king corner room the rooms are spacious and clean the beds super comfy it has a fridge and large bathroom the pool was nice too if i had one negative comment it would be the food and drinks purchased at the hotel are super over priced 4 beers three hotdogs 1 order of california rolls for 85 you are better off eating out elsewhere breakfast at the sienna restaurant though is worth it before heading out to universal studios even if it is pricy if you;4
my boyfriend and i stayed two nights in a standard cabin at the jane in late may good points the shared bathrooms were lovely the showers were powerful and hot and we didnt have to wait to get in while there isnt breakfast included there is a cafe in the building which is pretty cheap and serves amazing avocado toast towels bathrobes and bottled water provided in the room the staff were super friendly and helpful the location is great near the highline a subway station plenty of places to eat and you can go running close by beside the hudson it was pretty quiet we were on the fourth floor and werent disturbed by noise at night at all bad points the rooms were really tiny like really tiny if you have any bags then they end up taking up most of;4
very nice roomfairly spacious for an nyc hotelcomfy bedplenty good stuff to see and eat within a close proximityreminds me of a w hotel in many respects dim lights dark colorstrance music in the lobbyrooftop club hopping into the night two problems my company was paying for the room tax all taken care of but they would not let me check in because i did not have a valid credit card for incidentals my credit card was stolen the night before and i was in the middle of going through the nonsense that ensues they said i could put down an exorbitant amount of cash to cover but i didnt have not could i get the cash their policy basically had me sitting in the lobby for 56 hours waiting for help to arrive in the form of a coworker who could;4
hotel is in a good location opposite madison square gardens first impressions of the hotel is that it is well used but is clean which i believe is all you need for a city break as we spent very little time in the hotel stayed on the 24th floor and had a view of empire state building hotel staff were pleasant and helpful good security free wifi overall good value and i would stay here again;4
i was pleasantly surprised when i walked into the hotel a door guard greeted me held the door open as i wheeled my case in the lobby was really clean i managed to go straight to the check in desk without waiting the staff were very friendly my room was quite old fashioned but i wasnt staying there to judge the decor so it didnt bother me i was really pleased with how big the room was with a good king size bed for just a single person wardrobe was a decent size with plenty of hanging space there was a chest of drawers for more clothing storage space there was a dressing table chair mirror 2 bedside cabinets the tv was good with plenty of channels despite there not being a remote controller so you had to manually change the channels volume even with all;4
we stayed at this trendy and nice hotel for 4 nights our first impression was not that positive we did not get any help from the bellmen outside and the staff in the reception that checked us in did not inform us of anything where the gym was witch elevator we needed to use to get to our room pool deck etcour room was quite spacious kingsize bed and enough space for our big suitcases and shopping bags the pool deck was cozy and relaxing but the pool was a little bit small they also have a rooftop bar that was very cool and trendy nice view and good drinks the lobby was busy very spacious nicely decorated and thereâ´s free wifi there we only once saw a group of teenage girls passing by to look at the lobby on a gossip girl tour luckily our first impression;4
we stayed here while visiting friends in the city the location was great close to subway stations central park time warner building lots of shops near by starbucks and a drugstore right around the corner i thought the room was a great size for nyc bathroom was small but functional we had a room a few floors up away from the elevators facing the lincon center nice and quiet with the noise you would expect staying in nyc overall had a great experience would definitely stay here again;4
most number of vans to hotel of any lax hotels this make it a snap to get form the airport to the hotel if speed to your bed is what your looking for this is your hotel vans run on average every 10 min hotel bar burgers are great the salad with chicken is wonderful dressing is perfect;4
i must say im glad i stayed at this hotel i was just reading the reviews on here and im glad i listened to the good ones this hotel had just recently been renovated and is very very nice the lobby and our room as wel as the restaurant were all in excellent condition the parking is 12day in a gated and guarded lot i had to smoke outside because my room was nonsmoking since i had children with me i felt comfortable smoking outside by myself at 100 am and i am a female now i do not know much about la but it did not seem dangerous in the slightest i had a 2 queen beds room it was very spacious with nice furnishings the bathroom was large the pool was very nice and heated it is outdoors inthe corner of the parking lot but there is a 6 foot concrete;4
lovely quaint hotel great location at the end of the high line and close to everything in the west village one of those rare ny places where the old has been preserved and celebrated lovely room great shower the only real downside was the traffic noise from 11 ave it interfered with our sleep make sure your room is at the back recommend the wafels and the espresso too in their restaurant the rose;4
great location for great eats close to everything and clean basic room john helped with parking and provided a tip sheet of his favorite food places stayed in nyc 25 times loved being in chinatown and not having to ever take a cab or subway for what i wanted to do would return for more;4
perfect location for lincoln center concierge made reservations at two wonderful nearby restaurants and car service to make an early flight room was small but adequate with two double beds for friends sharing exceptionally clean quiet room despite central location decent view of manhattan agreeable helpful staff bellman ran out to 7th ave to get a cab when needed in pouring rainmuch appreciated;4
stayed in sept 2017 for 5 days with my boyfriend check in was smooth and we were allocated a room above 20th floor which allowed us to use the fast lift room was small but comfortable and just what you expect from ny location was great as we were central to everything we wanted to do;4
my wife and i normally stay up town but were booked into the new yorker for the new york marathon the room was small but clean and well appointed and cleaning staff did little extras the art deco lobby and building history were of note as were the tick tock dinner open 24hrs and and italian resturant closes too early location between 34th and 35th is across from msg and close to maceys subway stop right at hotel the hotel was wonderful during marathon and it was much appreciated good value for the price 2 improvements that should be made hotel needs loaner umbrellas and shouldnt charge to store bags while waiting to head to the airport;4
this hotel is right across form lincoln center our room was a little small but not claustrophobic lobby roof are nice i would recommend this hotel price was reasonable when i booked close to many trains a block from central park;4
biggest advantage was the location of the hotel one minute to underground with lines 1 2 3 that can take you almost everywhere on manhattan without transferring close to central park great food around the room itself was nice clean smelled funny kind of as detergents but not too bad our window in bathroom couldnt be closed completely which made it quite cold but i dont blame hotel since we didnt complained about that to anyone and just used air conditioner as a heater maybe we just didnt know how to close it properly people very nice for that price i think we couldnt find a better place if youll be there you must try little italy or famiglia pizzas nearby;4
luis made us feel so welcomed at the front desk heâs personable professional and accommodating the views are incredible the only complaint we had was some water damage and rust in the bathroom awesome staff;4
location couldnt have been better for my needs room clean and comfortable great view of time square internet connection was not consistent would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room;4
this hotel offers some of the lowest prices in nyc situated at jane st and the west side highway ask for a quiet room the rooms are spartan and small had a bunk room with shared bathrooms which are kept very clean all sorts of people stay here a hipster joint in the evening with its nightclub free wifi and tvs for upper and lower bunks my cell phone would not work in the room but that is minor annoyance comfy bed basically it is a place to crash and get cleaned up for your next adventure in nyc not lounging around would stay again for the funky vibe this is not a business hotel they do have about 30 rooms with king size bed and private bath;4
excellent service wonderful location local bars nearby and excellent food air conditioning unit is very very noisy but works well would have liked a coffee machine in the room rather than the lobby but would return again;4
nice hotel and close to universal studios only complaint is that wifi is only accessible from lobby and this is a huge inconvenience in 2013 most hotels offer free inroom wifi and charging guests at an already expensive hotel is nothing more than a cash grab;4
great location easy to get to friendly staff concierge susie was great room was clean decent size for age of hotel easy access back to lincoln tunnel hector valet got us a cab at rush hour when we were told it would take an hour;4
i had stayed here previously with my husband in 2010 so knew the location was ideal and was happy to return this time with my daughters we took the train from newark only 30 minutes and penn station is literally just across the road from the hotel very simple straightforward and a bargain at 13 we had requested a high room so was a little disappointed to be allocated the 20th floor but went up with an open mind i knew the rooms were small but we had paid for a metro view and this room only had a tiny window looking down at mcdonalds i went back down to reception and expressed our disappointment especially as the trip was to celebrate my daughterâs 30th birthdays they allocated us a different room straight away we just had to wait for it to be cleaned what a result;4
every employee does everything in their power to make you happy its so refreshing the biggest differentiator among hotels is not the structure but the staff and empires is the top notch across the board only 4 stars because its very aggravating trying to get to the gym in a bank of 4 elevators only 1 goes to the gym floor the call button isnt specific to that one so in order to get to the gym you have to play a sort of shell game keeping hitting down until the correct door opens if you can get to the gym they have free water so you may feel like a game show participant working the puzzle for the simple reward;4
across the street from the lincoln center quick walk to central park coffee and pastry shops close by subway entrance quick walk hop on for a quick subway ride to anywhere came in for a show at the beacon theatre a nice 13 minute walk plenty of people around the room needs work our view was a wall with air conditioning units everywhere sun has no way in your room and the conditioning units always had water coming down from them so it was always looking like a rainy night the bathroom was tiny no place to put your things the staff were very nice you get free bottle water everyday but you have to ask at the front desk we stayed on the first floor took the stairs up and downthat was convenient the location was perfect for us;4
great location small but adequate rooms very clean staff eager to please i would definitely stay here again inroom keurig a plus we walked across to central park in the morning and to theatre district at night it is close enough to walk everywhere but far enough away from the business huge plus 24 hr drug store just steps away;4
my partner and i enjoyed our stay at this hotel it was generally clean and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly the hotel is situated very close to times square we thought the location was perfect as it was easy enough to get to from jfk using the air train and the subway good value for money my only comment if iâm being picky is that our headboard on the bed needs replacing would stay here again and would recommend to a friend;4
good hotel located away from most attractions however very near the subway and local buses we didnt drive and found reception really helpful when trying to get somewhere on transport they would print off instructions etc breakfast is very good and part of the room rate so we took advantage most days good selection of different whether got or cold locally the nearest restaurants are up on vermont and around a 15mons walk away but again good selection and nice neighbour the hotel is located very near one of the hospitals which is very sizeable and the streets at night are quite if walking around but we got used to the area reasonable in price location ok;4
the empire is across from lincoln center it is very convenient to many restaurants in the area the rooms are comfortable the staff is especially helpful it is away from the theater district but within walking distance;4
we stayed for 3 nights saturdaytuesday in november i dont understand some of the truly terrible reviews cons cold reception area and lobby roomsbathroom slightly small i think small rooms is something you expect from a nyc hotel anyway at least we were we booked via trailfinders and requested a highfloor room we got the 4th floor but this was adequate we did buy 4 drinks from the lobby bar on the first night what a mistake we were told to sit at a table and we would be waited on for 2 cocktails a vodka soda and a beer we were charged 64 this was including a nonoptional service charge so be warned the coffee pods are chargeable if you use them from the room but starbucks is right next door so we just ended up going there had some interesting;4
stayed for 2 nights perfect location since i picked this out to be as close to central park 5 min walk about 5 blocks to center square and every subway close by lugo i think his name was very helpful when i asked to look for an outlet so i can charge my phone friendly desk staff no problem if you show up early want to leave your luggage so you can wonder around until your check in time my room was kinda small perfect for solo traveler like myself but comfortable bed the bathroom was my favorite part also the noise from outside your room hallway can be loudly heard when theres people talking otherwise i would stay here again since i get corporate discount from work with best value for the money;4
stayed for 4 nights we were upgraded at check in bottle of complimentary sparkling wine left in the room for my birthday very friendly and helpful staff room very clean and modern little bit small but didnât need it any bigger as we didnât spend much time in our room butcher and banker restaurant in the hotel is way over priced was expecting a lot more for what we paid;4
this is my second time staying at empire first one was longer and for business the staff is always friendly and competent ive stayed almost two weeks total and never had one issue with service check inout is simple and rooftop barrestaurant has a great view and value price is very reasonable location is perfect for anything ny not just manhattan 1015 uber ride to penn st which i took both times lets you get anywhere in the city or state if i had one small criticism it would be that the rooms are a little older but its an older hotelbuilding and not that big of deal overall i love this place and combination of everything described would be hard to find;4
we stayed here during our recent trip to california hotel is virtually next door to universal studios which is what we wanted to do and were able to walk in the morning to it has nice ambience in the entry hall and couple of nice restaurants for food as well parking is available onsite but comes at an added extra cost has a pool which is kids friendly but is outside however it does have water that is temperature controlled our room was decent size looked modern however i must say carpet in the room looked dirty not upto the mark they do not provide slippers for stay so be prepared to have your shoes on unless you are happy to walk on dirty carpet staff was nice and cheerful buffet breakfast had lots of options of food but is pricey one thing to note is the;4
iâve stayed at this hotel many times over the past 20 years if you are going to lincoln center it is perfect the rooms are small no closets if you are staying more than two days might be too small no coffee in room the restaurant is closed but good ones nearby;4
just returned yesterday and loved our stay in new york only downside was the size of the room it was tiny and could hardly move not even enough space to open our suitcases to unpack had asked for a bigger room with a view as we were staying for our anniversary but didnât get it so no view just looking into hotel windows so had to keep curtains closed bed was uncomfortable with a big dip in the middle which we rolled into but room was clean although itâs an old hotel with some beautiful original art deco features it needs a paint in the hallways as it dark and dingy location was ideal though security at lifts were friendly and polite reception staff miserable 2 per bag storage after checking out was great and the guy was lovely would come again but only if i was;4
i have just returned from a fabulous 5 day trip to new york with 2 evenings at the opera house we stayed at the empire which is literally 2 minutes walk away and a perfect location for opera buffs or theatre and ballet also at lincoln center for the arts i had seen mixed reviews on this hotel but we took a chance and am very glad we did apart from the location the staff were all very friendly and helpful the room was in a quiet location and much bigger than expected the beds were very comfortable the bathroom was a little small but adequate with nice towels etc this hotel is in a great location for central park which was lovely for walking and also many interesting restaurants in the area and an a upscale shopping mall in columbus circle should you be interested;4
close to the universal park walking excellent well mark walk to cat walk shopping pubs souvenirs etc shuttle every 12 hour to and from universal clean grounds and excellent dã©cor inside and outside ponds pool hot tub areas;4
the new yorker has the good reputation of an excellent located hotel the fact that it is right next to the penn station helps with train travellers or tourists that come from jfk airport like us very good staff service the room was particularly small no kettle for coffee or tea excellent view;4
i stayed at the new yorker during a weekend of shopping and broadway shows in manhattan and believe itâs a good choice for a short trip the price is ok and the location is just great nearby times square service is good and quite quick compared to other others in the same neighborhood you do not wait so much of time for the checkin and checkout the rooms are comfortable although a bit old but this goes with the affordable price;4
i wasnt expecting much after reading the mixed reviews but the pros definitely outweighed the cons yes the rooms are small in need of an upgrade but the shower is excellent bed is comfortable they have daily maid service all of the staff is outstanding location cant be beat;4
friendly staff great location comfortable bed in need of room updating i would stay here again because of the location breakfast was fine fast elevators early garbage truck pick up out on street woke us up quie early each morning;4
we stayed 6 nights in the hotel the period was during the storm sandy we had no idea what to expert but the hotel gave us good information what to do they had a list with restaurants who were open when we arrived also ã lot of information was given what to do where;4
location very near 123 metro only 510min to times square and 1015min pennst macyâ´s tribeca soho 900m10 min to lincoln center by foot also near central park dakota strawberry fields nearby many not overpriced good restaurants fairwaymarket excellent grocery other services very nice neighbourhood we had 17th floor penthhouse w1 bedroom spacious living room with lcd tv huge roof top terrace with beautiful skyline bathroom next to famous and historical ansonia building small good enough kitchenette coffee maker fridge clean small bathroom but ok check inout fast reception ordered taxi back to jfk but no actual overall service which we didnâ´t need open 8am10pm but 247 security;4
we stayed in this hotel for 1 week its in a great location near the subway to go down down or uptown very close to central park and a short walk to times square the pool area and bar is great though was closed over labour weekend due to high winds room was a good size we had the king sized room we got a free upgrade from a queen size reception staff were very friendly so thanks all staff were friendly and accommodating;4
my stay here was good enough the booking were done on time and the staff service was great facilities were good enough to spend a week with family i was impressed by the foodand drinks they serve recommended;4
came here for my birthday in november and wasnt disappointed whilst the rooms were on the small side and my bed was next to the window on a busy street this didnt bother me at all aided by the fact my window had a view of the empire state everyone was very hospitable and everything was very clean would definitely stay here again if i go to new york in the future;4
conveniently located could actually walk there from terminal 7 shuttle back to the airport was easy and left on a regular schedule room was fine clean fairly large i had no problems staff were friendly and helpful i would stay again;4
a great place to catch up on a time zone or two the hyatt regency provided a comfortable clean space to rest and recover from the rigors of a long haul flight the market provided 24 hour access to a variety of food and beverages all served with a smile;4
very quaint hotel in the upper west side great value for the location room was clean and tidy extremely helpful and accommodating staff some of the public areas looked a bit tired but all in all i would recommend this hotel and would stay here again;4
this is my second stay at this hotel mostly for location so close to lincoln center the park columbus circle with subway stop we had a queen room which was a little small and bath area was small too shelving not designed too well for usage charges for wifi are unbelievable did not use room service as starbucks drug store were right down stairs only problem was an upcharge after we checked out for usage of a converter i did call they took this extra off of my charge;4
i would highly recommend this hotel based on location 10 minutes walk to the subway opposite the lincoln centre endless amount of taxis outside only a 4 out of 5 though based on the crazy cost of breakfast;4
located in mid town perfect for msg penn station empire state macys etc an art deco hotel that is looking shabby in places check in friendly and efficient room tiny but clean and comfortable very very busy whilst we were there but staff coped well and were always charming stayed for five nights and perfectly suited our needs bed comfy and shower one of best ive ever used down side the 29 dollar per night facilities fee is a rip off no coffee maker in room room needed a makeover traffic noise even on 24th floor can keep you awake;4
we had a corner king room with connecting two queen room the rooms were spacious and clean the view from the 19th floor was great no maid service unless asked for but no towel racks in bathrooms was awkward the king room had a large bathroom with lots of floor space and counter space but just a standard tub there was supposed to be a concierge but desk was never staffed the pool was only outdoors and it was 50 degrees so didnât use that wifi wasnât free for hilton honors members which was disappointing staff were nice when we interacted but almost always lines at the front desk we had flight issues and checked in at midnight and no line then elevators were slow and always a wait worth it if you are going to universal but otherwise overpriced for what is;4
is an excellent choice for travelers visiting new york offering a luxurious environment along with many services designed to enhance your stay close to most of new yorks landmarks such as love sculpture 08 km and manhattan skyline 11 km hotel new york marriott marquis is a great destination for tourists;4
when we arrived at the hotel they were polite and asked about our journey and offered to upgrade our room to a double when i said i was in new york for a birthday holiday we were again upgraded to a double room on the 31st floor with a view of the empire state which was a pleasant surprise like everyone else the location was the one of the best things as its right around the corner from penn station and madison square gardens making it easy to get there from jfk by getting the air train to jamaica and then the subway easily walkable to places like times square empire state and the chrysler building plus macys is around the corner the hotel lobby is beautiful and the whole hotel is very art deco the room was a decent size and was always clean all staff were;4
spend a week at the empire rooms were fine not special minibar and small items in room small fitness room but good really great to walk easily into central park also in subway with 50 steps rooftop bar is very nice after a day walking through the city;4
the hotel location is perfect just in front of the lincoln center and the room was clean and comfortable the bathroom is small but with a good distribution we arrived at the hotel for 2nd time at 1530 and the room wasnt ready because it needed the house keeping verification the same excuse at 1430 after complained several times for the waiting time at last were in our room at 1605 the most listened word at the lobby was i apologize said to us and to the rest of the guests that were waiting for their room for a long time as us they gave to us a complimentary breakfast for the checkin delay;4
i only stayed in the hotel for one night and didnt dine here i know nyc hotel rooms are usually tiny and far pricier than you could imagine i live within driving distance of nyc and chose to stay in this hotel so that i wouldnt have to drive home or uber with that said i was still shocked to find out that parking my car for one night with the hotels valet would set me back 75 had i known i wouldve just parked my car in a nearby parking garage best parking app on my iphone has always hooked me up with really cheap parking this is what i get for choosing convenience over price ouch after checking in my friends and i immediately headed up to the rooftop barpool area that was perfect we were able to nab a table take in the fantastic surrounding nyc;4
myself and my friend visited for a week and we did love the hotel main complaint was that the wifi is not complimentary in the rooms and comes at a cost of 999 per night or 2499 for 3 nights there is free wifi in the lobby the rooms are adequately sized exactly what youd expect for nyc and include a minibar iron hairdryer coffee maker first few drinks are free then any restocks will come at a cost tv etc the shower in the room is fantastic i generally prefer a bath but i loved this one though the layoutmissing door situation is quite odd there is a starbucks as you exit the hotel and a duane reade within walking distance its also close to the shops at columbus circle which also includes a whole foods which was good when we didnt fancy a full meal;4
i love staying at the empire hotel mostly for its location as i usually go to lincoln center the attendants are very kind at the front desk i only had a problema with a reservation made by phone with the blue note which didnt work when i got to the club i guess it might have been blue notes fault the room i was in at this last stay wasnt so good a bit noisy 732 and the bathrooms are too small the robes and towels were too much used the beds and pillows are very confortable even so i love staying at the empire;4
stayed here for 4 nights the hotel is very close to universal studios and universal city walk our room was on the 19th floor and was very quite with a lovely comfy bed the staff made us all feel very welcome and where always on hand to answer our many questions about la during our stay we hired a car the hotel charged us 30 a night to park at the hotel this i thought was expensive all in all a good hotel and a good base to explore universal and la just be aware of the parking charges if hiring a car;4
before arriving and after reading reviews i thought about getting ready to ask to upgrade our room as soon as we checked in so that we would have a view however after being told that we were on the 33rd floor i thought wed go and see the room first the room was very small but it did what we wantedpaid for and we only used it for night didnt spend much time in there at all i was pleased that we had a glimpse of the city not just the side of another building although no landmarks visible but thats fine the lobby is gorgeous and the staff are very friendly and welcoming location is perfect 10 min stroll to times square under a minute to msg and very close to fifth avenue shopping and macys first time to nyc from england and were so glad we found this;4
the room was big clean well equipped even had a fridge microwaveð staff were very friendly the breakfasts were spot on we enjoyed our stay here and would return again with the children in future;4
check in and concierge very efficient and helpful we got there at the same time as huge coachload arrived luckily the hilton honors line was free but we still had to wait a little while for someone to notice us the room was furnished well but with a lack of drawer and cupboard space for a longer stay our room was starting to look a little tired and ready for an overhaul perhaps although the bed was very comfortale an unfortunate incident meant we spilt some microground coffee powder we let the maid know and went out for the day on our return we were surprised to note that she had attempted to clean it with a damp cloth rather than use a vacuum cleaner on the dry powder needless to say there was a nasty stain remaining on the carpet this did not spoil our visit;4
the best feature is the great location near penn station access to amtrak and subway ace123 trains near empire state bldg macys 1015 min walk to time square mc donalds staples just accross but feel free to explore the area for lots of great restaurants lobby is nice beware of facilities fee addon when you book your room this is a required fee that covers internet phone business office fitnesss facility regular room is small but not too tight strong water pressure for bath and faucet but they use separate dials for hot and cold water total of 4 so you cannot mix and feel the water temperature from faucet then transfer to shower thick towels nice bed linen and a comfortable sleep 10 elevators means a short waiting time luggage storage;4
friendliest staff around decent accommodations and amenities terrific location bizarre wallpaper definitely a conversation piece good buffet breakfast in rooftop lounge a definite asset reasonable parking access would come back anytime;4
having e mailed the hotel a few days before arrival to request a room overlooking lincoln centre this was my daughters 18th birthday present i received a response saying they were subject to availability fair enough i thought upon arrival i asked again only to be told we had not paid for a room with a view we were not given this option when booking with our agent my daughter her friend had a room on the 7th floor ours was on the 9th both the same rooms overlooking the courtyard if i had had a cat i wouldnt have dared swing it in the space we had no room to put cases without falling over them only 4 hangers each now i didnt pack a great deal but that was a joke the wallpaper was peeling in our room the girls air con had seen better days but we got on;4
the empire is a cool hotel popped in for a couple of cocktails which were very nice prices as to be expected 17 each being new york the hotel is so perfectly located making it easy to get around if visiting to do the touristy bits;4
i stayed in one of their newly renovated rooms and it was excellent very aesthetically pleasing and comfortable with great amenities the location was great and very convenient to the subway or cabs and near lots of restaurants etc however some negatives where that when i was there the elevator broke several times also the floors that had not been recently renovated looked old and dirty and the treadmill in the exercise room was broken also;4
if you like older buildings with character and a little quirky then this is the place for you the rooms are small has the vibe on a tasteful comfy monastic cell on a boat but what more do you really need there is a tv ac big mirror and plenty of storage the bathrooms are clean and often empty when i used them the water is always hot the staff is friendly i liked the roof bar especially the outdoor space the first floor cafe area is big and spacious but does not offer much i think they are renovating the kitchen be sure to walk along the nearby hudson river park checkout the whitney museum and the highline of course up a block away from the river is a little park that has a waterfall feature i went there every morning to meditate it is a very cute;4
i stayed at the jane last fall due to a friends recommendation since i couldnt find a decent hotel under 400 everything was booked and expensive due to a conference and fashion week i was apprehensive about the shared bathroom and small room since i was traveling for work but it was fine and only 99 sidebar my coworkers stayed at a popular brand hotel that week for 400600 and ended up leaving due to bed bugs the room is very small cruise ship like but i wasnt in there much and i would work in the bistro downstairs anyway not a fan of shared bathrooms but they were extremely clean initially i was uncomfortable but then realized that everyone was in the same situation i did have a neighbor who lived in the hotel permanently and has been there for;4
we have just returned to the uk having spent 5 nights in new york at the new yorker hotel prior to the trip we were apprehensive having read some negative reviews but we neednt have worried on arrival the checkin staff were efficient getting us up the line quickly we were 3 hours early for checkin but our room was ready and we were delighted when we were offered a bottle of champagne as we were celebrating our honeymoon the room itself on the 21st floor done the job initially we found it very cold and noisy with a crafty window but again on turning up the heating the room remained at a comfortable temperature for our stayand after spending an average of 9 miles a day walking the noise of horns and sirens from outside didnt disturb our sleep the rooms could maybe;4
booked an executive room on the 24th floor ive definitely had worse but ive had better just likely nothing better anywhere in this area so if you want to stay close to universal its the nicest very annoying that you had to pay 795 for every internet connection each day so for me i needed for phone and notebook higher end hotel that should be included valet parking was 24 per night self park 20 good service at the restaurant but pricey;4
we enjoy staying at this hotel but the internet is horrible also if you like your privacy in the bathroom pick another hotel there is no sound barrier with the sliding door that slides back open with that said staff very friendly food is not bad bed is comfortable and they have an airport shuttle;4
nice hotel staff were really nice and we were able to check in earlier than we expected which was great after being on a really long flight room was clean not a lot of places to eat near the hotel but there are some about 15mins walk good location if youre going to universal like we did and its close to the metro;4
beautiful lobby rooftop bar was extremely loud and not so enjoyable breakfast served in the same area was very nice hotel rooms were dated and could use some updating no coffee makers or ice buckets in the roomslocation to the lincoln center and restaurants were a great benefit staff is friendly and very helpful would stay here again for sure;4
the hotel is convenient to theaters subway and central park rooms are small but comfortable very clean bathrooms appear to be brand new the staff were excellent matthew the manager was very hospitable and professional;4
originally booked nyc for april 2020 to visit family but obviously with covid itâs taken until now to get there when the opportunity to travel at christmas came up we jumped at the chance this wasnât the hotel we originally booked but it turned out to be better than our first choice location is brilliant slap bang in mid town opposite madison square garden so easy walking distance to times square empire state is 5 minutes away and the high line hudsons yard 10 minutes we also walked the 25 minutes to central park which is a straight route from the hotelâ¦â¦this was our second visit to nyc so did know our way around a little penn station is 2 minutes away and the subway is fairly easy to navigate our rooms were a little on the small side and a bit dated but for the;4
this hotel is at a brilliant location its walking distance to nearly everything if not catch the subway was given a rubbish room on 24th floor couldnt swing a guinee pig in but was able to change it to a room where you could just about swing a cat on the 33rd floor would stay here again;4
good facilities modern and beautiful rooms and good service of all staff and an extraordinary location between times square and central park one suggestion the beds a too soft in my opinion it would be harder improvement mattresses;4
this hotel had everything you need and is an ideal base for visiting the area the staff were really pleasant and helpful thanks to the lovely girls and guys on reception especially giselle who tried to help me locate a item i had left in a taxi rooms were clean and had all the facilities you would need gym was good breakfast was complimentary and was really good value and quality overall a good experience and i would stay here again one tip taxis can be a little pricey however the metro which is 5 mins walk away is ideal for visiting the surrounding areas and also very cheap thanks hotel hollywood for a great stay;4
we stay in manhattan often when we have an event to go to rather than drive home we stay in different hotels depending where the event is ameritania is a great place for us to stay for a broadway play and this is the third stay at this hotel in about two years they have discontinued the free breakfast we had the first two stays im sure it was in the description and i didnt read it but it was a disappointment anyway a manager that heard us talking quickly understood the confusion explained the policy change and let us in without any questions i recommend ameritania to others and will stay there again;4
we were very happy with our stay at the ameritania the location was perfect between times square and central park the hotel is updated and clean and the staff were very nice would definitely stay there again;4
i am a travel agent and stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on vacation in december checkin was fast and easy we got there a bit before checkin time and they had a room available so they let us check in early the lobby is so quirky and interesting we went up the elevator to our room it was functional for the price we werent expecting much but the bedspreads were clean there was a safe in the closet and seemed to be decorated to the similar old ship cabin style of the rest of the hotel the shared bathrooms down the hall were really great for a shared bathroom we quite often saw staff come in to mop or wipe down the counter tops they were always very clean the two shower stalls and two toilet stalls both had large wooden doors no gaps at bottom or top that;4
stayed in a standard room once and it was tiny this past stay i chose and executive double for only a few more bucks and got a seriously upgraded room its like the tale of two hotels one has all the classic fittings fixtures tile work and cramped quarters of a classic hotel the other is spacious with modern fixtures views can vary but i was upgraded and pleased with my view looking down 34th st service was good but its real hard to catch a cab the lobby is also always busy but its in a high traffic area not crazy about the diner food but youll take what you can get sometimes;4
stayed here on our 1st visit to new york we found the location good for us 10 min walk from times sq and empire state building the hotel restaurant tick tock was a good place to fuel up to start the day good sign that it was used by locals as well as guests rooms are of a decent size and reasonable quality but hey you dont go to new york to stay in your room we would stay here again;4
very nice hotel and very clean staff was very friendly but be prepared to pay a huge amount for food at the shop on the main level the valet service was excellent the design of the rooms was wonderful and had all the latest technology;4
we stayed for one night at the hotel the public area at reception is very nice our room was nice the bathroom clean but dated what surprised us was the size of the room it was not large but bigger than we expected for a city centre hotel we ate in the restaurant linked to the hotel at night and in the diner also linked to the hotel in the morning both meals were very nice we thought they were a little pricey but realised later on our trip that the prices were lower than other like places in new york the staff were friendly and the location pretty good the public corridor on the floor we stayed was in need of a refresh but all in all it is a pretty decent hotel;4
the room was small but more than adequate for sleeping purposes we had a second floor room no view but it was quiet which ended up being more important than i first thought the neighborhood was great with several neighborhood eateries stores nearby we didnt see much of the staff but that wasnt why we were there to start with so i cant really give an opinion on the staff except to say that the room was clean the beds comfortable and the staff i did come in contact with were pleasant on the negative no coffee i would stay here again;4
nice hotel and rooms and love the location my only complaints were with housekeeping the mouthwash was already opened and when they replaced it they left the empty bottle on the counter table looked like it was moved and crooked towels were super sloppy and when they did the turn down service they only did it for one person when there were two people robesheets candy;4
my only complaint about the hotel is that the night we chose to stay they were testing the emergency generator at 100 am we did not know this until we checked in after a 14 hour flight from sydney it was off until we left the hotel around 300 am to catch our flight home we were unable to sleep once the electricity went out as my husbands cpap machine went off and the room started to get warm when attempting to leave the first shuttle van drove past us;4
i stayed at the empire for one night on a business trip i was determined to squeeze in a night at the opera during this trip and the empire was the best located hotel for that purpose i booked the cheapest room available about 170 generally that kind of money gets you a flea bag in midtown my room was certainly small but very comfortable luxury amenities wonderful towels and a robe and a great bed were all there i dont know if there was a view i didnt look the staff was very nice and check in was not a problem the only thing i could complain about is that when i inquired about printing my boarding pass in the morning at the front desk told me there would be a charge when i did print out the boarding pass there was no charge the lobby has free wifi;4
i love this hotel the lobby is a beautiful artdeco style and the rooms are nicely decorated the beds and linens are very comfortable the bathroom is a little dated but the shower s water pressure blew me away our view from the room was magnificent we had a direct view to the empire stare building the hotel has a 24 hour diner in the lobby which is a great convenience and the food is really good;4
on the rare overnights we stay in manhattan we normally chose to stay downtown however we were looking for a change and a location closer to attractions we hadnt yet visited empire hotel looks like an apartment building from the outside but on the inside is a lovely hotel with a cozy lobby very helpful doormen and wellappointed furnishings my kids were super surprised when we walked in it is across from lincoln center attached to pj clarkes starbucks is literally around the corner and the smith a great seafood restaurant is across the street you can also walk a block into central park theres a rooftop outdoor pool and deck we didnt get to experience because of the season if we return in warmer weather will be sure to use it;4
was impressed that they texted me when i hadnt yet checked in with a late flight room was very nice and clean breakfast buffet was well laid out with the expected omelet bar overall friendly staff if you dont mind the price its a good location and predictably nice hotel experience;4
the lobby and bar are very nice my room was tiny but clean and modern i had a view of lincoln center great location as it is near lincoln center the park subway columbus circle broadway etc;4
lovely rooftop bar with great view of manhattanstunning way to watch the sunset and same view as gossip girl enjoy the tasty food best to come in happy hour time as expensive drinks otherwise pool less of a pool more of a five stride paddle great for pretty drinks and people watching;4
as all reviews state this hotel is in the best location i guess it comes down to you get what you pay for we stayed 5 nights over new year on the 21st floor and although weâd requested a high floor with a view we didnât get one it was booked months in advance for a bargain price if weâd paid the prices they were charging at the time weâd have been very disappointed itâs definitely a budget hotel itâs great if you donât worry about the size or decor of the room the decor is old and dated especially in the drab corridors the bathroom was tiny and old but always clean the staff were very friendly and helpful sean the security guard was especially friendly and interesting to talk to;4
i was in la for four nights to take in a couple ball games and sights of the area the hotel is very convenient to the metro red line of the la mass transit system which provides connection to other metro lines and union station the closest station is vermont santa monica approximately 2 blocks south of the hotel breakfast was way better than anticipated with more or less a full breakfast every morning the room is a decent size for a single traveler or couple be sure to request a room not on vermont as it is quite loud and sirens pass by as it is a major street bed was comfortable and everything worked as expected with regards to tv and internet the staff was courtesy and business like i am mostly selfsufficient so i did not make any local inquiries i;4
i picked the hotel on price and location after hearing mixed reviews from relatives living nearby the staff is great the location couldnt be better the room was small but nicely fixed up its a perfect location for lincoln center and the west side;4
i had stayed here several years ago and it was such an excellent visit it seemed like an obvious choice for this trip this was not an extended stay just needed a one night stay with close proximity to griffith observatory and studio city only there a few hours basically to sleep and it was fine for that the room we were in could use some updates but no major complaints we were on the interstate side before we stayed on the universal side which was a neat view it was cool to have the view this time because before we left i could show my son where we would be on mulholland drive within an hour location is great if you dont want to stay in hollywood but still be close about 3 miles and of course if you are going to universal studios you cant beat the location;4
beautiful looking hotel in the 1930âs style this our third stay at this hotel and find the location great for our purpose which is sight seeing and being central itâs great for trips up or downtown the hotel didnât serve breakfast but the tick tick diner attached to the hotel will serve you any breakfast you need i find the gym facilities are very good located just below the reception the rooms are nice and clean weâve always had a good view but to be honest youâre in new york so the room should be the place youâd be spending the least amount of time in;4
great location staff friendly and helpful had a meal in the evening which was very nice also had breakfast very busy go early or later plenty of availability of food and drinks good value for money in london evening drinks in lounge a let down due to queues as not enough staff on duty other than this a good stat and would go back;4
we visited this hotel from london for 4 nights in feb 2019 the location is itâs greatest asset being right next to penn station near numerous subway stations and right opposite a taco bell cantina and mcdonaldâs hello ð¤£ððââï¸ itâs a very busy hotel and when we arrived a tuesday afternoon there were large queues the staff were quite efficient though and we didnât wait too long the reception is a lovely spacious art deco area with a 24 hour diner to one side which we ate in once average the lifts are terrifying as are the corridors they mustâve filmed the shining here the room we had was tiny which we expected but clean and well equipped bed was very small by american standards the bathroom was very small and old fashioned if we stayed again weâd probably;4
i was a bit worried due to other reviews but the stay was fairly decent i asked if they had any renovated rooms but was told that my price i won it on priceline for 150 didnt qualify me for that kind of room the hostess instead gave me a room that was updated on the lower floor and i had no issues with that the carpet and bathroom were very clean and there was no sign of bed bugs on the very clean comfortable bed if i had any issue it would be that the bed was shortsheeted i was only staying one night so i didnt complain and that i needed to stand by the window in order to get any sort of cell phone signal all in all it was a good place to spend a night;4
very nice hotel and friendly staff throughout good location if visiting universal studios but a little removed if you want to explore hollywood and other areas of la only out of hotel options for dinner in walkable distance are those in universal city walk metro station not too far but down quite a steep hill you will need cash to use if you dont have an american card and only atm is in the hotel so remember to use before leaving really liked the;4
my mom was having surgery at los angeles medical center our room was right around the corner such a lovely oasis after spending hours in the ccu breakfast was great and there are numerous terrific restaurants within minutes in los feliz and silverlake our patio opened into the courtyard with a lovely fountain and the tallest birds of paradise ive ever seen parking was secure which was a plus;4
i absolutely loved it here the staff made me feel so welcome in fact it was a bit emotional when i was leaving i would most definitely go back the rooms are basic and clean but the hotel is also central to the trains buses and shops not to mention the great central park across the road this was my best birthday ever;4
we stayed here for the rose bowl compared to wi hotels it was expensive they forgot to charge us for parking which was nice rooms were just fine but not over the top there is a starbucks inside too;4
lovely room with a view and lovely location really enjoyed ourselves and a lot of restaurants nearby to eat too which was convenient for us service was great and staff were helpful and friendly;4
this is the closest hotel to universal studios it is literally a 5 minute walk to the entrance or there is a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes there is also onsite parking at 28 per day for selfparking or 40 for valet it is a bit steep price wise the staff is very helpful at his hotel it includes the sierra cafã© but beware the prices here are high for the buffet menus it also has a lounge for drinks or bar menus plus there is a small coffee shop there is an outside pool that also has a bar the rooms are good and fairly large if you can get a room with a view over the park bathrooms could do with an update but are adequate while i was there it took a while to get an elevator as they were working on them a good hotel if you want to be close to universal;4
i stayed here for 4 nights while moving my son to la for school i dont think it was actually that close to universal studios and it wasnt too close to the freeway its in an okay area but has a pretty nice free breakfast that is served for longer than normal hours in a nice restaurant setting our fridge did not work but it wasnt essential room and bed were comfortable had a little balcony parking is secure but is an extra charge son used fitness room and said it was good pool looked nice outdoor but i didnt have time to use it theres lots of entertainment opportunities in the downstairs bar although i didnt have the time to take advantage of that either complaint elevators slow and no option to take stairs;4
when i first heard of the empire several decades ago it still offered generous discounts to academics but then became quite expensive under subsequent management on a lark i checked rates for christmas eve and it was quite affordable 148 including taxes for a small room with a queen bed it was calm and clean and had everything i needed except a coffeemaker i will definitely try to return when my schedule and the rates align when i return i will make sure to be hungry in the morning and splurge on the rooftop breakfast buffet it looked to be worth 25 the hotel staff and the restaurant staff two separate businesses were all lovely;4

we stayed for 5 nights during half term upon arrival check in was very smooth and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite with amazing views of the empire state building i found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful and in particular i am very gtrateful to a member of the night staff on our first evening my son was very afraid of being on the 40th floor and had panic attacks and was ill during the night i went to reception at 330am it was the only way i could calm him down and explained our circumstances and the gentleman was so supportive of my son and agreed to change our room the next day the following morning my son had calmed and i took him to reception to advise that he was going to try and stay in the room heâs only 11 but the staff;4

we stayed at this hotel in july 2010 it was our first time in nyc rooms are of a good size for a new york hotel bathroom is small but clean overall experience was excellent great location pool is very small so this was a disappointment but the view is so great that we made fun of the situation the hotel is close to the subway station which was convenient for us;4
got this hotel last minute on our first trip to new york we were unsure where to stay but were pleased with the location front desk staff especially jose were extremely friendly and helpful as this was a last minute booking we had only been able to book a queen bed jose was able to get us an excellent upgrade with a lovely view the hotel is located a few blocks from central park and lincoln center is just across the street great access to public transit and lots of cabs out front shopping is close by and times square was a 20 minute walk great location and wonderful hotel only complaint was that the elevators were a little slow would definitely stay here again;4
i stayed at the empire for a quick night ive stayed there several times before i love the convenient location this time however i had a leaky faucet in the bathroom which caused the floor to be wet i thought i could put up with it for one night in the end i should have called maintenance because i paid for the room and shouldnt have accepted its present condition;4

after a long journey we arrived at the hotel and the first impression was impressive a swift check in and we got to our room it was on the first floor small and very warmopened the window and the view was of the opposite wall and the air con fans were loud straight back to reception and we were given another room on the 6th floor same scenario no view and too noisy another trip to reception very unhappy at this stage we were given a new room on the 8 th floor much bigger no noise and the air con was on brilliant very pleased with it a great view up toward the lincoln centre after this the only blip we had was a toilet blockage which was dealt with quickly and without fuss the bed was a king size mega comfy the only gripe would be that there were no;4

me and my girlfriend stayed at the empire for 6 nights so we got to see a lot of the hotel when we arrived someone came to open the door of the taxi he welcomes us took our bags to the check in desk and we never saw him again i had a cast which meant that my girlfriend had to carry all of our luggages by herself to the room after the check in pasquale who made our check in was very nice and very concerned about my leg as he gave us a nice upgrade to a bigger room on the 11th floor with 2 queen size beds as i told him a friend of mine was coming for one night he also gave us free wifi for the whole stay which saved us a lot of money if i remember well about 20 for 24 hours the view from the pool deck and the pool deck itself is really nice plus it is a cool place;4
the location of this hotel gives you easy access to the lincoln centre and broadway as well as central park the lobby has an open seating area with comfortable chairs and is a great place to meet up with friends on the mezzanine level you can access eds chowder house where you can get breakfast and the fish menu for lunch and dinner is excellent wifi is not free although i was given free wifi because i stayed for a week however the first 3 days gave me a good internet connection but after that it was frustrating trying to do anything on line as the connection was poor whilst the basic rooms are quite small and dark and the bathroom is pretty basic with a walk in shower but very little room to get dressed it might need some negotiating if you are sharing with someone my;4
stayed for three nights april 2019 booked executive high floor got an upgrade with a corner room with an awesome hills view on the 22nd floor the room the view the bed the extra seating and the bathroom were all great super comfortable clean and spacious no complaints the proximity to universal studios and citywalk is also amazingly convenient less than 10 minute walk perfect the rest of the hotel is just average the breakfast buffet is a joke to pay these nightly rates and then have to âupgradeâ to get a hot breakfast option is just ridiculous the customer service in most areas of hotel is ok but itâs not great i would like to give a huge shoutout to the valet who checked the backseat after i got out of a cab and lo and behold found i had left a bag;4
initially we were in a tiny room and thankfully were moved for the last 2 nights i wished weâd had that room all along as it was much more pleasant the cooling in the room worked and the toilet didnât self flush all night;4
love the room and beds are great best post jet lag sleep i am annoyed by hotels that charge so much for parking itâs not downtown or anything and they have their own lot location may be great if you come to universal studios;4
walking distance to universal studios a very quick walk and convenient very clean exceptional staff and customer service area was safe but if you dont want to walk there is a shuttle that will take you to the park;4
stayed in the new yorker hotel for 4 nights on our first night stayed in a room on floor 22 the room was very tired and dated needed a lick of paint but on our second night we were moved to the 31st floor which had been refurbished and was lovely very clean towels and soap and shampoo provided and hairdryer and iron and ironing board very central near macyâs and maddison square garden walking distance to empire state building and times square and port authority bus station where you catch buses to the shopping outlets such as jersey gardens and woodbury common would stay here again and recommed to family and friends;4
the hotel is well situated for central park most of the key sites and has good public transport links stayed 5 nights here and although the airconditioning was noisy it was great to have it and escape the 95 degree f heat the pool deck is a great addition and means you can even obtain a suntan in the city;4
the pros this hotel has easy access to hollywood and other attractions and restaurants first of all let me start by saying they do not serve your average free breakfast they serve the best breakfast you could imagine from fresh orange juice lemonade to omelette homemade waffles and a variety of foods it was my favorite part hugo elvira were great friendly and i liked how they remembered my friend and i after the first day we went the restaurant area is very nice as well as the patio area in the middle where the bar is the staff is extremely friendly and helpful from the front it may not look so pretty but the back entrance where the parking is is beautiful i saw the pool but did not get in but its small and private the parking is secure but;4
the jane is located in the west village a charming neighbourhood and historical part of manhattan the architecture of the jane is beautiful while the decor ballroom and roof deck is eclectic you have peacocks monkeys chandeliers and ceramics a menagerie of genre this was my 3rd time to the jane i generally stay between 4 to 6 nights located across the street from the hudson river the hudson path is a great for walking jogging or biking either down to battery park or up to riverside park the highline is minutes away soothing for an evening walk during the sweltering summer heat while the whitney opened late on friday has superb views of lower manhattan from anyone of the numerous outdoor terraces hudson street is minutes from the jane there are many;4

i made our reservations through expedia and was excited about the cheap rates we decided to go no frills considering we would be spending minimal time in the room a few days prior to the trip i decided to check out the reviews on trip advisor and was frightened i joked with my friends that they may not want to walk on the carpet bare footed and shower shoes might be a necessity i have to say my expectations were surprisingly exceeded pros cheap rates more money to spend shopping clean sheets towels clean carpet literally a minute walk to the subway station starbucks mcdonalds and a 24 hr drug store on the block nice location for exploring the city with only a 1015 min subway ride from times square the express train will get you there faster cons;4
when you book the jane hotel do your homework not all rooms have ensuite bathrooms and some are bunk beds there are a few that are fully appointed which is what i booked small size rooms are in line with the historical context of the building quirky house guests still reside there hip popular nightclub on the weekend so be prepared for noise and people definitely ask to see the ballroom as its worth it restaurant is good service can be slow so be patient coffee bar in morning great space to work excellent location and crazy price enjoyed the uniforms;4
this hotel is very convenient but is showing its age the lobbies and rooms are very worn at least on our level the room was quite good with windows on two sides as it was s corner room american hotels need to understand the benefits of providing a fridge and coffee making facilities in their rooms it was convenient also having the 247 tick tock cafe downstairs for meals at any time;4
the staff was excellent and friendly the location perfect the one major gripe is charging guests for wifi i realize its free to anyone in the lobby and guests only on rooftop however as a paying guest 400 plus a night i expect wifi in my room if the idea is to get me out of my room to the lobby to use it so that i spend i am not happy if the concept is that you need my 12 thats sad in this day an age wifi is in all rooms the comfort inn gives free wifi think about it i along with any stranger wanders into your lobby have free wifi now here i am a paying guest and i cant use it in my room other than that your hotel is lovely i checked in and was offered a smoking room if i wanted to ck in early i took it a non smoker and it was just fine no smell interior;4
i shopped around to find the least expensive hotel that wasnt in a bad area and this was it i had a room with 2 double beds it was small but it was perfect for just sleeping it was quiet and the staff was friendly i would stay there again;4
hotel was fine and the staff was very helpful i would not go to ny unless you have to people are peeing and taking craps right on the side walk people have snack tables set up all over the sidewalks to sell drugs so many homeless and people with metal health issues all around the hotel city is not safe;4
the hotel was nice and in a great location itâs a little dark in the hallways and in the rooms the food is a bit pricey but the staff was very accommodating and there were plenty of useful amenities there is plenty to do and lots to eat within walking distance of the hotel;4
just had four nights here hotel is ideally located for a lot of the attractions room was very nice clean with very comfy beds and lovely crisp sheets would have given it a five star review however i really missed making myself a cup of tea in my room so kettle etc would have been appreciated and there was a fridge in the room which was locked for some reason special shout out and mention to jeff the doorman who was so lovely and helpful sorted us with a taxi for our return to the airport nothing was too much troublethe young man who collected us who was contracted to the hotel was an absolute delight and was so friendly and got us to jfk with time to spare despite the traffic being horrendous can very much recommend this hotel;4

i went to ny on spring break last year and i saw all the terrible reviews online we didnt have a lot of money or familiarity with the city but we heard this place was in a nice neighborhood and it was 100 bucks a night the room was clean with no bed bugs the bathroom was always empty and clean we missed our checkout time but the staff really didnt care so we werent charged a late fee for the price of this hotel youre getting a clean place in a very nice neighborhood we went into this situation expecting a hellhole so we brought sleeping bags and precautions but never used any of them my roommates said it was noisy at night but i never heard anything if you plan on spending time out in the city and not a lot of time in your room this is the place to;4
a very nice property with great views and spacious rooms our executive level room had an outstanding view of universal studios and the hollywood hills we had a fridge and a little sitting area getting downstairs from the 23rd floor was an ordeal since the elevator stopped on every floor to retrieve more guests on our final trip down a bride and her entourage crammed themselves in so she wouldnt be late for the weddingthey had been waiting a long time for an empty car the staff was friendly and helpful all around looking forward to staying here again;4
good stop close to airport clean neat and it had coffee in the room a plus that vegas lackedð the bar and meals were good with very friendly and helpful staff they also had a shuttle to the airport the next day that was free;4
visited nyc and stayed at the empire in early november 2011 what a great locationacross from the stunning lincoln center and a short walk to central park its a more upscale part of town and not hip happening like soho and meat packing etc but for the older crowd who stil wants some boutique hipness its a very central location and hotel with flair the roof top is awesome although once the club gets going later at night the crowd is kinda hmmmrico suave meets polyester the actual staff both in the roof top club and the front dest of the hotelalthough not affiliated0are all pleasent and proffessionali definitely reccomend this hotel as a decent fun place to stay and the hotel bar is kinda fun to hang out in too also decent irish fare at the adjoining pubok;4
i booked a single cabin with access to a shared bathroom it was an absolute bargain the room was very small the length of the single bed but that is exactly what i expected the hotel was great for the price lovely bars especially the view from the roof terrace and a nice cafã© nice staff good service happy to refill my water when asked and get me a taxi the shared bathrooms were always clean and i never had to wait as with any new york hotel there is some street noise but it wasnt too bad for the city the one complaint i have is that the upstairs bar was closed one evening for a private event and when the guests left at 3am they were very noisy as the review implies the rooms are very small so the communal areas are important i would check in;4
the empire is convenient to the park and the subway system at columbus circle it is chic and attractive generous room size for nyc with comfortable beds many nearby restaurants and close proximity to lincoln center and the arts gym is small;4
hollywood hotel was wonderful the front desk staff were friendly and the gift shop staff were helpful my only concern was that our room was entered even though the privacy sign was on the door one afternoon we came back the door was even left open i always ensure that the door is always securely locked before leaving other than that the breakfast and the hotel amenities were amazing thank you for a great stay;4

this is the hotel from series gossip girl if you want to spoil yourself while staying in ny empire might be just the right place for you a bit expensive but yet unique everybody knows about the city nightlife spot rooftop club at this hotel stupid thing is that if they charge you that much for a room you should get a wifi but hey its not enough they charge you later for that they are prompt and helpful free wifi in the lobby no breakfast tip use the elevator on the right and go to the last floor have a drink and enjoy the view;4
we just stayed at the ameritania hotel from the 116 til the 206 as our first stop on our american holiday this hotel is in a fantastic location 6 blocks from times square so slightly out of the hustle and bustle of the night life but close enough itâs an easy walk in the hotel is surrounded by numerous metro lines to take you to all the sights of nyc the room we were in was a big retro style room overlooking 8th street the bed was huge and comfortable with a good size bathroom the staff were amazing at the front desk and helped us with local eateries entertainment and things to do during our stay the door lads were great and very friendly when we left and got back to the hotel special mention to jeff who really went the extra mile with making us feel welcome;4

great place to stay for a visit to universal studios shuttles run to the park every 20 minutes or so the breakfast buffet was very good but for a family 7 it can be a little too pricey didnt get great service in the bar area and its really not great for the kids the menu is too adult in the restaurant and again a little pricey youd think that being across form universal studios they would have a more kid friendly menu;4

the new yorker is a huge hotel of 1050 rooms which had me scared when i entered the huge and busy lobby no need to have been scared as all the staff were helpful concerned and very pleasant whilst our room was small it was spotlessly clean the shower had great pressure which was definitely lacking in the previous hotel we were in we would be happy to stay at the new yorker again;4
front office staff was very clear about everything during the check in and even checked on our stay throughout i love the location of the hotel just 7 minutes walk from universal studio staffs were all very helpful when we had questions at this day and age wifi should be available with no conditions attached charging for wifi is really dated standard room amenities like kettle toothbrushes should have been provided but theyre available upon request;4
i have had bigger closets however it is a good value and great location make sure you ask for one of the renovated floors yes they will try to upcharge you however i got the upcharge from 40 as noted by a previous reviewer to 20 the best part about our room was believe it or not it was quiet go back probably due to the price;4
me and my husband stayed at this hotel in late september this year to get married at the hotel and found it to be alot better than most of the reviews on here first of all the location was not as bad as i had expected the subway was only 3 blocks away and it took you into the city or if you wanted to explore nearly all the way to the bottom of manhatten we found this mode of transport to be very cheap and quick the hotel rooms are smallish but there is room to move around and we found the bathroom quite a decent size and very clean there is only one elevator but this did not seem to be an issue when we stayed a couple of times we were waiting for it when it turned up with staff and all the cleaning products in but they always moved all of their things out and let us;4

we stayed at the hollywood hotel for 2 night with 4 adults on the 2nd floor and the front of the hotel we found this to be an good location good breakfast if a lot choices lovely friendly staff room was very clean and spacious considering we had two queen size beds there is a pool however we didnt get time for a swim and no spa there was a laundry and gift shop the only negative was that you had to pay for parking 20 tax;4
starting by saying my overall rating is 35 viewlocation 910prime spot if youre visiting universal studios for work or play corner rooms with a view are nice bed 510average comfort support decor 510stuck in the late 80searly 90s for most of the hotel rooms are at least updated cleanliness 710above average but not immaculate service 910friendly helpful staff prompt service value 510;4
my second trip to nyc and knew what to expect for the price that we paid the room was a good size with a very nice bathroom and we had a cracking view looking down onto times square we had a roll away bed in the room and still had loads of space there and it was exceptionally clean i went with two friends in one room and we all thought we had an excellent deal for what we paid location was once again excellent and had no problems with the staff;4
the empire hotel is so close to lincoln center that you could go back to the room during intermissions if you wanted to our double room was small as most rooms in nyc are it was very clean and quiet even though it was on the broadway side the water on the nightstand with a very large price tag proclaiming a 7 charge if we drank it was a negative to an otherwise nice room i must add that the tap water was pleasant tasting checkin and checkout were quick and staff were friendly and pleasant we did not have our cat with us this time but pets are welcome for a fee;4
hotel is in parts looking a bit tired but for the price location and included breakfast beats some four star hotels staff where helpful and friendly only downside was the slow running drain in the shower with a foot bath taken at every shower location to train awesome and we hired a car and from that prospective was readily accessible to all we wanted to visit saving heaps on taxi and bus fares and parking spot at the hotel although thought that this was overpriced;4
very good location in the heart of the theater district right across the street from the lincoln center walking distance from good restaurants and subway entrance walking distance from central park and shopping;4
the hotel is within walking distance of lax there is a shuttle service to and from lax which works well with late and early flights the kingsize bed room is big and clean i enjoyed relaxing on the corner sofa watching tv reading and sleeping and when i finally got around to staying in because of a stormy day i loved watching tv in bed the hotel staff were really nice especially antonio buenaflor the asst outlets manager who went out of his way to look after me when i wasnt well i would recommend staying here if you plan to do excursions via lax or just want to be close to the airport there is restaurant expect to pay 12 for a sandwich at lunchtime dinner is around 40 with no dessert or alcohol dinner was excellent if you dont want to spend;4
airport hotels can often be bland but this is modern stylish and welcoming nice rooms very clean and well appointed service though is exemplary and still what hospitality should be the guest comes first the room service menu has a confusion on items only available at weekends but realizing thats what i wanted they made sure i got it exemplary when so many others these days would say tough well done hyatt look forward to staying here again;4
no experience of other hotels in ny but this met our needs for a long weekend room reasonably large 2 twin bed clean good bar cold breakfast buffet good hot breakfast buffet far too expensive disorganized breakfast service menu items took far too long overheard manager telling guests that they could not provide a boiled egg however the location and reasonable level of dã©cor overrides these niggles as other have said bring your own bottled water;4
the new yorker is the perfectly placed hotel for anyone wanting the full midtown manhattan experience right outside of madison sq garden arena with some fab breakfast places just a short walk away its a great central base the lobby is very impressive and looks grand and very art deco we stayed on the 29th floor and although the corridors were a bit shabby and worn the room itself was lovely if a bit smaller than expected the bathroom couldnt fit more than one person in and there was very little space around the bed but for two people it was comfortable enough the bed was very comfy and the tv worked well for late night help you fall asleep functions the room was kept clean and the staff were all friendly enough too we didnt eat at the new yorker and id;4
nice hotel we stayed 2 nights specifically to do universal studios it was a great loctation for that has an amazing food dining and room service menu hotel was clean and staff were friendly and helpful we recommend staying here;4
we stayed at the empire hotel for 6 nights from august 13 to august 19 2016 it is really easy to reach as it is located just between two subway stations columbus circle and lincoln center on the 66th no need to walk a lot or climb too many stairs with luggage our vacation in nyc started with some good news as our standard room was upgraded to a kingsize room with no price increase so thumbs up room was great comfortable enormous bed two huge tvs and lots of space unfortunately weather in manhattan was incredibly hot in those days and for two nights we had some troubles with air conditioning we really appreciated when we were given a fan to sleep better since the third day there was no problem anymore and our aircon worked perfectly bathroom was clean;4
hyatt regency has been modernized and has excellent facilities for a comfortable and easy stay predeparture lax should you have an early flight and want to be close by the park and fly garage is hyatts garage so it is also convenient and much less expensive to just leave your car in self park garage or valet if your so inclined the hotel and room met the usual hyatt standards they claimed to have netflix to log into but didnt they do have hdmi connection;4
we stayed for a week at the new yorker the hotel is located opposite madison square gardens the room was a bit dated but a decent size the view wasnt the best as we were at the back of the hotel and you could see the edge attraction but at the end of the day we only spent time in the room sleeping as we were out all day the tick tock diner was really good and the food was tasty the hotel staff were very friendly and we liked the fact that security always checked to see if you were a guest before entering the lifts the hotel is also close to the subway and a wee walk to times square we went to liberty bagels for breakfast as theyre was a great selection of bagels and cream cheese we went to hells kitchen area for our evening meals lots of choices as well we would stay;4
very good hotel stay pet friendly we memy wife and my 7 yr old kid usually carry our dog everywhere so pet friendly hotel is what we look for everywhere hotel was pricy and on top of that pet fee per night and parking fee everynight is little hurting however breakfast was awesome overall i should mention it was a great stay;4
hey yall i actually stayed at morningside inn for a total of six months while i was attending school in nyc i must say that at first i had my reservations about the place but soon considered it home patrick hotel manager was amazing hes super friendly and helpful when needed i found the staff to also share the same friendliness the only thing that was a little upsetting the whole time i was there was the fact that the phones were out of commission a lot it became a little frustrating but all in all i felt completely safe there no major problems with other attendents great location and would recommend this place to anyone that wants to save money to spend on in that amazing city;4
we bought opera tickets to see madama butterfly at the met by the way its right across the street from this hotel i found a great deal on hotelcom and booked it for the night when we arrived to check in we were graciously upgraded from a standard queen room to deluxe king i was very pleased with that the hotel itself is very charming and warm we ordered room service for breakfast and to our surprise the food was excellent our modernized deluxe king sized room was very cozy however i was unsatisfied how the bathroom was structured especially the shower area the bathroom had a toilet sink and a walk in shower with not even half of a doorborder whenever we showered the water would spill out to the bathroom floor i called the front desk to complain;4
if you are going to universal studios i would highly recommend this hotel you cant get any closer the rooms were very nice and ours looked recently renovated we had 2 adjoining rooms on a high floor and it worked out great views of were also great you wont be disappointed staying here;4
canât believe so many people complaining about this place for the price itâs amazing the location is second to none 2 minutes to penn station and the garden loads of bars and restaurants to hand sure itâs noisy outside but where isnât in manhattan the staff are friendly and helpful the place is clean the rooms are small but the advert tells you that great place if you are looking to explore nyc;4
my best friends wedding and my 50th birthday so we wanted to stay somewhere nice so we did the new yorker is one of the cityâs oldest and most classic hotels this art deco hotel has been preserved and is well located in midtown 34th street we had a suite high up facing the river with a large balcony directly under the red new yorker sign which could have been used for a party if weâd been organised we found the staff friendly and interested weâd definitely return to this hotel aside new york has changed a great deal since i stated going in 1995 and in recent years a range of local city taxes are now a standard feature on all hotels bills expect a quarter of your bill to be additional taxes so something to bear in mind when booking a hotel room particularly one in a;4
the hyatt corp has made their hotels more hipster in their appearance over the years while that may be disquieting dark wood panels istore type ambiance in the lobby it is the good level of service without the hipster arrogance that really makes this place nice;4
nice clean hotel good size rooms pretty little garden area with lights convenient location friendly staff at front desk breakfast could have been a little beter but im not sure if this has recently been upgraded all in all great value for moneywould definitely stay there again;4
i was surprised how quiet it was at night and how it was close to the tube nothing to complain about really the bathroom could be a little bit a bigger so thats maybe one thing had a comfortable bed and clean sheets;4
we returned today from a 4 night stay in the empire we found it to be a lovely hotel in a great location 2 minute walk from the subway and a 5 minute walk from central park the staff are all helpful and friendly and were quick to offer directions and advice i would have given the hotel 5 but the air con unit leaked onto my boyfriends case causing several items of clothing to get wet we informed reception and they dry cleaned the items at no cost on the same day with many apologies and smiles the rooms arent huge but big enough for what you need i would hope you wouldnt be spending too much time in your room if youre a tourist in nyc the mini bar is expensive as everyone says but just dont use it theres a starbucks on the corner that opens at 530am if;4
the hotel is quaint centrally located by lincoln center a great area roof top bar has great view and is a nice place to gather rooms are small but well appointed and the room rate is competitive right downstairs you have pj clarks a great restaurant for a casual meal;4
as always this hotel has a lot of activity in the lobby because of its location our room was fine on a high floor and away from the construction on the lower floors our traveling companions did not have it as fortunate and they had noise odors and too much activity for their liking the hotel tried very hard to help out but due to the capacity issues they could not do much breakfast buffet was wonderful;4
very tiny room but this is what you expect in nyc a surprise fee of 63 was charged at the check in for two nights good location very close to subway close to high line park parking is expensive in this area so look for deals on the net before leaving we used spothero and found a great deal for three days parking can leave the baggage at the hotel for 2 per bag;4
we have just come back from staying at the empire hotel we stayed here for 6 nights all of which were really good only a couple of things iâve seen a lot of reviews about the airconditioningheater unit it is quite poor but i assume as they are renovating the lobby this will be something they are looking into itâs just quite loud and you canât really work out the heat from the cold however this didnât ruin anything for us when we checked out we had been charged 20 for coffee apparently your first lot of coffee capsules are free then after that they charge just something to be aware of as i didnât read this anywhere again didnât really worry us as we had had a coffee every morning and 20 for say 10 coffees isnât really bad it would cost you that for two at;4
we usually stay outside the city when we visit but decided to splurge and stay closer to the action this time the days inn hotel was overall a good experience front desk was professional doormen courteous housekeeping satisfactory we booked a nonsmoking room the room smelled okay but the entire hallway smelled like smoke had permeated the dated carpet and walls our room itself was small but clean with dated furnishingsnot a big deal since we were out of the room all day no bugs lots of extra pillows ancient tv with few channelsagain overall ok since we mainly used the room for sleeping it was on w94th very close to metro station lots of places to eat and purchase incidentals couple blocks to central park nice area to walk around daytime and evening the;4
photos are from our room we had a room on 24th floor room 49 awesome room they upgraded us make sure you get this room we had two rooms one with walk in wardrobe and safe 2 double beds and a tv the other room had a dining table and chairs lounge table tv and fridge bathroom in between it had shampoo conditioner and bath gel the view was fantastic service was great staff were friendly and helpful rooms great downside it would have been nice like they do in most hotels have tea and coffee milk kettle etc the basics so you could make a cuppa tea or coffee instead of going downstairs early in the morning also they was no information about the hotel or where you could go or what to do in ny i know you could go to the front desk but sitting in your room;4
great hotel with friendly staff who were very willing to help with anything that we asked fab location close to macys and the empire state building we were upgraded to a room with a beautiful view when i told them we were on honeymoon;4
the empire has a look and feel of new york city and provided a comfortable base from which to explore the city our room was a little small but beautifully furnished and with a comfortable bed and great shower what more do you need we enjoyed two delicious breakfasts in ed chowder house and the view from the rooftop bar is glorious drinks and food at the hotel is premium priced but to be expected the location of the hotel is very pleasing close to lots of restaurants and bustling new york we enjoyed some opera being broadcast live from lincoln centre in the evening which was an interesting diversion whilst eating al fresco in one of the outside restaurants;4
we stayed five nights at the empire hotel on a family trip to ny it is very conveniently located the staff is friendly and helpful specially at the front desk the room is nicely decorated clean and the beds are good might need a renovation on the common areas very soon but it is one of the best deals pricebenefit in town;4
hotel is in a great location and the rooms were fine as we didnt spend much time in them apart from sleeping staff are really nice and the concierges were very pleasant and helpful we ate in both the restaurant and the diner and food was excellent;4
booked 2 rooms for a mid week stay nyu med school graduation at alice tully hall and needed to be within walking distance of lincoln center the proximity to the center and many top notch restaurants is truly excellent the beds are very comfortable bathrooms a bit small and no place to put your toiletries the closet is a free standing unit with the refrig underneath so its difficult to hang long garments the front entrance and lobby are very classy the front desk people are most accommodating the bellhop and valet were friendly and so helpful the parking is great either valet or self park we did the 24 hour special self park hotel rate and saved dollars very fast and easy to park and pick up car upon leaving fully stocked bar if you choose to indulge we did;4
friendly and helpful staff in reception free wifi very fast good location near red line metro stations vermontsanta monica and vermontsunset happy with a room facing the courtyard wouldnt want one facing vermont very busy street parking costs 20 per day plenty of space during our stay room clean and spacious breakfast was alright only complaint was a very grumpy busboy and in general they didnt smile a lot in the restaurant;4
i have been three times to the empire hã´tel everytime l truly enjoyed staying there it feels like being home the staff is very helpful and l always been very well looked after the rooms are large and well appointed it is also so well placed near the lincoln centre columbus circus central park and a host of lovely shops and restaurants;4
if you dont want to pay top dollar and arent fussed about a glitzy hotel in midtown then this is the place for you yes the rooms are on the smaller side but this is always the case in nyc our room was cleaned to an excellent standard daily the bathroom had an excellent shower and hairdryer the location of this place is fantastic grand street subway is a 2min walk away and provides great transport links chinatown is on your doorstep little italy is less than a 5min walk and great shopping can be found on broadway less than a 10min walk away good breakfast bagels can be got from the shopdeli on the opposite corner of forsyth for a fraction of the midtown costs i would certainly stay at this hotel again;4
extremely pleased with service and quality of the wyndham new yorker hotel also being located so close to new york penn station train was a bonus;4
we stayed here a couple nights while visiting universal studios this is a hilton property and a rather large hotel but you could walk to universal within five minutes a couple things to be aware of 1 getting to universal from the hotel with a stroller or wheelchair is challenging the bridge to universal only has stairs and its rather steep getting there if you cannot take the bridge it is also not very accommodating you have to walk into the parking garage as cars come out if you have a stroller or wheelchair a little frightening when lots of cars are leaving 2 we went during spring break so it was crowded but they did well accommodating to the crowds 3 the service staff was awesome 4 the elevators were being serviced during spring break and it caused some;4
this hotel is very confortable has nice rooms very good structure gym saunapoolthe breakfast is delicious and the omelette made by hugo are delicious all the staff is very kindly my permanence in this hotel was a pleasure will advice people coming here when they come to hollywood;4
we stayed at the hotel in october 2019 and overall the stay was alright pros the location was nice itâs on broadway right next to the late show with stephen colbert central park and times square are within walking distance thereâs a starbucks right across the street a subway station right around the corner and further down broadway the view is nice at night if you book a city view which we did though at first we were given a room facing out into an alley but the stuff friendly and moved us the next day the beds were comfortable the tea and coffee bar in the morning was nice the hotel was clean cons the 20 usd a day residence fee not a surprise as it was in the booking email but overall;4

booked this hotel though trailfinders well done tf superb location near central park the lincoln centre just off broadway in upper midtown on the âny subwayâ between 59th 66th on the no 1 line very comfortable ny hotel in a âretroâ almost âart decoâ style our room was very comfortable king bed large tv antiquated ac unit also with a fridge stocked with expensive drinks good linen towels my only complaint was that you canât make yourself a hot drink the âpodâ system is extortionate but thereâs is s starbucks next door result didnât try the âcocktail barâ after getting stung by the coffee pods there is a ârooftop bar which is very comfortable under separate ownership with a great view down broadway great âdoor teamâ service staff;4
the empire has a great vibe near everything you could want and the service is staff is just so friendly and helpful i highly recommend it if you have a chance grab dinner at eds chowder house which is attached to the hotel the food is superb wrap up the evening by heading up to the newly redesigned rooftop for a cocktail its got a nice lounge feel enjoy;4
the location is great for in and out near the airport the service was great and fast loved the deli in the lobby lots of interesting options fast and easy the valet parking is too expensive there is a self parking in the back of the building at less than half the price;4
is my fifth time in ny and since the first one i always choose the empire hotel excelent location rooms are average the rooftop is amazing wifi internet shoud be free i also recommend to have dinner in the restaurant food is great;4
i learned on my first visit to la that there are huge sections of town that appear to be rundownsemiseedy and this lovely hotel is smack in the middle of one of those neighborhoods on the plus side was the great free hot breakfast the courtyard the location near metro easy to get to the walk of fame and universal the pool and the room itself small but clean and well appointed my only negative was the price of the gated parking 22 per day nonetheless i really enjoyed the stay and had no problems with the area despite appearances;4
we stayed here for a week and the hotel is stunning fantastic location for subways and main attractions staff friendly rooms cleaned well on arrival we had a lovely family room on the third floor with a small sofa so good size living space view slightly off from the lincoln center however we quickly noted there isnt much in the way of storage you get half a wardrobe which you cant hang fulllength dresses in we were there for a wedding so we had longer garments with us there were two small drawers for clothes and 2 small draws next to the bedside definitely not enough for a family of 4 and absolutely nowhere to store the 4 large suitcases we also noticed first thing in the morning there is no tea or coffee facilities however we had lots of family staying on;4
we stayed in the new yorker in july 2015 and was suprised by the old hotel it was well looked after and it was great to read and see of the history of the hotel the location was great as it was right next to msg and an easy walk to most places the sunset views were amazing looking towards the highline the service was excellent;4
perfect hotel for a quick shopping stop at lax minutes from the terminal hotel recently renovated very fun funky modern great cafe with all your needs available adjacent is a funky little sports bar with great service rooms large with super king bed seperate shower not over bath parking at rear of hotel was also very easy would definitely stay again;4
the hotel is centrally located to the hollywood attractions when we first pulled up we were a little concerned about the location once we stepped inside we were pleasantly surprised the decor was nice clean and spacious the room was a little smaller than expected but worked out fine the bathroom was spacious more counter space andor shelves to place personal belongings would be helpful but for the price i really cant complain we had a nice balcony that overlooked the lovely courtyard the breakfast selection was more than expectedfresh fruit pastries juices and more sonia and hugo were very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to ensure our breakfast experience was special the omelets and waffles were delicious all of the hotel staff;4
i was so pleased with the empire hotel i needed a room with relatively short notice on a date which coincided with the popes visit every place i researched had extremely inflated prices even for manhattan i kept wondering if there was some catch since the empire had rooms available at a rate i could afford i liked almost everything about it the staff was extremely friendly and helpful the room had many nice little touches i loved having my own personal keurig note there is a cost per pod the room and bathroom are extremely compact but i know that comes with the territory in manhattan the shower was interesting i am sure this is just me not having been exposed to this before but there was only half a door the stream fell so that the water stayed;4
this hotel is a really nice hotel especially perfect for gossip girl fans clean and quirky dã©cor and a good nights sleep perfect location for exploring the city but getting out of the madness really reasonable rate in january we did complain about a whirring noise in our room which was just an extractor fan of some kind which you get all through new york and they offered to move is but we got over it quickly and decided not to move rooms reception staff slightly helpful however wouldnt print anything for us and want to charge usd10 for use of the printers the rooms are pretty small and not much room for 2 large cases but we managed;4
it was a pleasure to stay in this hotel everything was very clean the bed was snow white and very clean bathroom a little bit noisy in the corridor and i could not open the window to get some air to the room but it was not a big deal so i would recomend this hotel for sure;4
there is a lot to like about the empire terrific views of lincoln center proximity to both central park and the theaters boutique style and manageable size the rooms are well appointed if you can afford it i recommend getting the larger deluxe room well worth the extra cost the hotel is very clean and the maid staff does a great job comfortable lobby and a fine lobby bar not part of the restaurant drawbacks the rooms with the views can be noisy with street traffic the restaurant eds on mezz level is very disappointing disinterested and terrible service mediocre food at best and way overpriced even by nyc standards its almost shockingly bad overall fortunately there are many very good restaurant options at all price levels nearby we had a;4
i booked two nights at this hotel blindly without even knowing the name it was a pleasant suprise for a price that was south of 20000 the common areas ared dated but nice the elevators are small and slow most rooms have no view the pool is smaller than a hot tub there is a south beach style club on the roof which draws crowds on weekend nights the guest rooms have been updated are are very nicely done small but very nice the hotel tries to make up on low rates by trying to sell you everything in your room the mini bar concept on steroids but all things considered a very nice stay next door to lincoln center at a very good price i would not hesitate to stay here again;4
positioned right in the heart of chinatown this hotel is just minute walk away from the nearest subway station and trendy restaurants mcdonald subway starbucks etc warmhearted staff and fresh quaint rooms local television reception was unfavorable if youre a tv person im not but you have great free strong wifi recommend for budget guests fewdays guests overnight guests and latebookers guests you wont be disappointed especially with a location in lower east side manhattan book early for no vacancy is viable during big events like new years eve;4
this hotel was in the perfect location we had a really nice stay and felt it was very clean and comfortable the tick took cafe had to be the best part we felt like we had been transported back in time would really recommend this hotel were able to sleep in the city that never sleeps;4
if you are going to lincoln center the broadway area central park or fordham and john jay college this hotel is in close proximity everyone from the door man gentlemen parking the cars and front desk staff was super polite and welcoming the room was squeaky clean and we could smell bleach in our room the rooms are small but comfortable biggest drawback the small bathroom but this hotel is in an old building the decor is very interesting i would definitely stay here again we understand there is an awesome roof top with a pool but it rained during our whole stay so we didnt see it;4
in a junior suite the room was a good size for three of us and it was very clean great view of columbus circle the lamp shade tattered tables had blotches and stainsneeds some tlc but we were very comfortable in the room overall location is perfect we will be staying here again and will try the next up size suite;4
stayed here on our trip to the us chose the hilton as we were handing our car back at the start of the stay and wanted to be close to universal room was spacious and clean pool was great for the kids and the bar service at the pool fr both kids and adults was great definitely the place to stay;4
this busy hotel is ideally situated across from penn station the rooms and the bathrooms are clean and although a bit dated they are reasonably well kept the corridors however could do with a bit of refurbishment the tick tock diner on the ground floor provides a good breakfast though the staff are somewhat impatient with the hotel guests and their breakfast vouchers;4
for those travelling for business and need to be close to lax for internal travel this is a great spot clean rooms showers could be improved but overall great food and service highly recommended for those wanting an easy location to stay that is not downtown;4
this hotel was pretty darn good on everything except bed comfort for me i prefer a soft bed with soft pillows the fact that it is 2017 and more hotels dont offer different options for comfort is mind boggling to me for an additional fee guest should be allowed to choose a 46 inch memory type foam placed on their bed upon checkin;4
as you can guess in the title number one point is the location across the street from the metropolitan opera if that is your thing 4 minutes walk from columbus circle 6 minutes walk to edge of central park 20 minutes walk to times square i had read some reviews and here are some comments about some of the things that i had read we were in a regular one bed room with no view the room seemed to have been refurbished recently as it did not feel dated at all the size of the room is really a typical manhattan room for me no desk or couches or anything like that if all you do in ny is visiting and attending shows and concerts and all you need for your room is to sleep it will be fine if you want to spend a lot of time in your room other than sleeping yes it is a;4
this hotel couldnt be in a better spot in nyc location is perfect close to all transport the only negative is the beds were very small and uncomfortable i have stayed in many nyc location and properties this is a keeper;4
great location nice rooms but the beds creak and the heater made horrible noises we werent in our room much because we werent thete to sleep the rooms were clean and the people friendly i would stay againbut not to sleep;4
we traveled down from upstate ny for a girls weekend and found the empire hotel to have attentive amazingly friendly staff from the doormen to check in bartenders they were aces the room did have some peeling wallpaper and paint but i dont really care it had amazing views of lincoln center after this experience i would recommend anyone stay there;4
flew into newark took train to penn station under msg hotel was right there about a block away easy way went to convert at msg great location for it had a diner at hotel that was open 24 hours friendly staff time square about a 10 block walk can see empire state building down the one street not far away room was fine needs updated;4

the hotel was ok it was our first time in the city and we really enjoyed it the room was small but we got free towels every day and never had to wait for the bathroom because some reviews complaint that they made a reservation but didnt receive a room we called the establishment to verify our reservation but every thing was ok the internet wasnt fast but it worked the last day we discovered there was a kitchen it would have been nice if they had told us the location was great subway was very close and around the corner was absolute bagle here you can buy bagles from 6 am to 6 pm cheap and delicious;4
location simply cannot be beat steps literally from lincoln center uptown downtown crosstown busses and subway within a block and 6 restaurants grocery takeout duane reade and starbucks all right there why am i telling you this all the rooms will probably be booked for my next visit;4
we stayed here the week before thanksgiving for one night before going to universal the next day the location was perfect if you are going to universal we were able to walk to and from the hotel the rooms were very nice actually nicer than i expected and the service was great too the breakfast buffet was overpriced so we asked around and got directions to the good neighbor cafe a short drive away and saved a ton on breakfast;4
i stayed here with my mom for 3 nights the hotel is in the absolute best location in manhattan in my opinion and this is my 5th time visiting we were right across the lincoln centre and minutes to central park we were able to walk to times square and rockefeller centre and my mom has mobility issues so that goes to show how conveniently its located there are lots of good restaurants all around my favourite the smith and you are close to all the subway lines the hotel itself is old and could use some renovations and repairs the rooms are old however they are clean and the hotel staff were super friendly helpful and responsive i would definitely stay here again;4
service we didnât really interact with the front desk that often but graciela was great we made a last minute booking and they accommodated us with ease room we got a king bed room that was updated in like the last 7ish years maybe it was spacious for new york standards and comfortably fit two people the room itself was clean the bed was actually pretty great especially after long hours of walking the ac unit can be a bit loud but honestly i didnât notice all i cared is that it worked and kept the room chilly the power outlets could definitely be improved and be more accessible but it really didnât bother us much as for sound the room next to us was a family with kids and we didnât hear them or anyone else at all could the room be updated yeah but did the;4
hotel room was clean and a very comfortable bed it was a small room with a very small bathroom the closet was a joke the view was an ally i loved the the whole atmosphere of the hotel in front there is a little park with tables directly across the street from lincoln center whole foods a few blocks away at columbus circle i felt very safe i would stay again but with a larger room and one with an actual view;4
we stayed in this hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of january 2014 to get to the airport in a yellow cab will cost you 52 plus tip bit of a queue but easy when you get one we were given a nice room on the 9th floor 2 big beds in the room lovely rainforest type shower and very very clean some damp in the corner of the room however the minibar prices are expensive 6 dollars for a small pot of pringles 750 for a bottle of water plus they then add on 18 tax charge they lay out a huge range of essentials including a love making kit lol but they are so expensive some freebies in the bathroom but be careful what you think is complimentary and what is chargeable our room was so hot we had the heating turned off in the room by maintenance however the heating;4
i stayed for one week in riverside studios and can honestly say i did not see any bugs or rodents the double room was large enough the maid came in every day and left clean towels and soap the bed was clean and the floor was vaccumed it was not a problem sharing a bathroom as it was empty most mornings when i went to shower the staff were friendly and helpful we were able to leave our cases at reception when we checked out and collected them later the only downside to this hotel was the fact that it is an old building and in need of renovation the room we were in was noisy as the hotel is close to the main road i felt safe in the area and after speaking to one local resident i found out that there are a few celebrities live very close if you want somewhere clean and;4
i put this hotel in my todo list a couple years ago it is a great option if you are planning to do universal only activities if you are planning to drive to other atractions or using uber or ride share if you are like me and try to use public tranportation then it migth not be the best eventhougt the red metro station is a couple min away this is walking up and down a hill they do have a shuttle that takes you straigth to city walk then you walk back to 23 mins to the hotel if you are up for that then this is the hotel for you either way be prepare to walk the staff is awesome staring from the greater outside who showed me to the front desk with a smile to the waiter and housekeeping always asking me if they can they help me i got nothingbut smiles;4
we stayed here with two kids on our trip to universal you can walk to the park and the shopsrestaurants there is also a shuttle if your feet are tired after a day at the park nice rooms and view helpful staff good coffee shop on the first floor skip the main cafe for dinner or sit down meals thoughâexpensive with mediocre food will do in a pinch though would stay here again;4
we were spending the day at universal studios and we thought it would be fun for the kids to stay in a hotel for a night so we booked the the hilton universal citylos angeles purely for location i was a little concerned because of the recent reviews but all in all it was a nice stay the room we had a room with double queen beds the room was nice with the exception of the multiple stains on the carpet the showers were nice and hot with good water pressure we had a high floor and the view of the city was awesome the kids loved looking at the view the pool the pool was busy not much room for the kids to do much they only waded for about 30 minutes there is a bar and dining by the pool room service i dont recommend room service they got our order;4
we arrived at the hotel filled with trepidation as we had after booking our room for four days seen a few recent negative reviews we honestly cannot figure out what these reviewers were writing about our room was clean the bed a bit too soft for our liking but it is a hotel we were on the first floor facing the courtyard and really should have taken advantage of this serenelooking space the shower water pressure was amazing the breakfast was super tasty eggs and waffles prepared by the amazing oralia yes the restaurant is in the basement but it didnt feel claustrophobic the neighbourhood wasnt pretty but we never felt concerned for our safety we walked from the hotel to the observatory and a mere mile away is a very funky neighbourhood of shops and;4
i stayed three nights at the jane and here are some tips for you should you decide to stay at this very reasonable and pleasant hotel 1 the bed it is not only a single bed for those going solo it is against a wall this means even less manoeuvring heres a tip swivel the mattress 180 degress why the lip of the mattress has likely been compressed and as a result the mattress angles toward the edge with the more stable lip of the mattress that has been facing the wall now turned to the beds edge you wont angle off toward the edge and you can then move the mattress about a handwith away from the wall without fear of falling over as that stable lip doesnt hand down this made all the difference in the world for my sleeping that little bit of extra room 2;4
this may not be a glamorous hotel but it is worth the lower cost that you can get a room for the location is great subway was a few steps away and only two stops from time square easy when the carpet and halls looked old i was weary of what the room would look like but was pleasantly surprised our bathroom was small but very clean and nice the beds were nice and our heatercooler worked great we would stay here again no problem when we checked out they even held our luggage in a room for us until 1030pm when we came back for it thanks days inn;4
i have just returned from a fanatastic 4 night stay in the astor hotel with my friend for a girlie weekend rooms were a good sizewe had room 101 with everything you need eg a comfortable bed and good showerthere was a complimentary coffee machine and internet access which we found useful for booking our empire state building tickets reception staff helpful and so were the door men the hotel is about 4 blocks from broadway overlooking central park so about a 10 minute walk from restaurants bars and shopsmama mexican can be highly recommended as amazing foodthe tavern bar was really nice and full of lovely people and cheap broadway bagels for breakfasts again excellent would definatly stay at this hotel again;4
iâll start off by saying that i am not the usual tourist who stays in this hotel i work in manhattan but commute into the city each day we were supposed to meet family from outoftown in nyc but they had to cancel their travel plans due to covid since it was too late to cancel our reservation without penalty we decided to stay here for the july 4 weekend we arrived at 830 pm and were checkedin by a very friendly and efficient front desk person we were given at room on the 31st floor and the room we had reserved the room was smaller than expected however it was laid out well so there was room to move around the room was very clean and the bed was great the room featured a keurig coffee maker with starbuckâs coffee pods and a small refrigerator the;4
this was an eye opener of a city this is my ideal world to live in what a beautiful city also with its downsides but i always try and find the beauty writhing things this hotel was another favourite of mine the only problem was the smallish room but what can i say its new york but it was still beautiful and the window wasnt that big but we still have a lovely view of the city and the sun setting on the city thy gym was good all facilities were overall great i just wish there was a pool or they light if had one but i didnt know i would defiantly recommend this hotel and city to tourists as it is a place to see;4
stayed here with family for a 4 night stay it has all you really need for staying in new york itâs not somewhere your going to spend a lot of time in a hotel room room was a little small for 3 of us couldnât wheel the case between the beds room was clean though just what we needed ice machine on our floor which was brill the tick tock dinner is brilliant being attached to the hotel we went every morning in a great location not a luxury stay if thatâs what your looking for but we werenât so was good for us;4
i wasnt going to write a review but then seeing what people wrote here i thought i wud put in my 2c worth i was in la to attend a conference between april 26 and may 1 i booked the hotel through orbitz and then started reading the reviews here which were not all that charitableso i must confess that i had second thoughts about the placewhich is why i am writing now to give you my honest opinion the location of the hotel is in a poorer part of west hollywood its just a hispanic neighborhood it is not threatening by any means just not as classy as you probably have been used to it is about 2 blocks away from the la metro systemwhich is just like the dc metro system the only drawback is that the metro doesnt take you to too many places it basically runs between;4
hotel is aging but mostly gracefully clean and has an amazing staff that are very accommodating dont miss the lobby bar for good cocktails in a relaxing atmosphere typical small room but very well appointed slow elevators and ac was never cold enough for me;4
clean quiet except for the occasional sirensi would definitely stay here again good security staff was helpful and eager to please we didnt dine on site this time but would in the future great bagles around the corner on w34th;4
this is a nice hotel with big rooms especially for families with kids to stay it is about 100meters from the metro station and bus stop very close to amenities stores and restaurants as there are no working restaurants in the hotel except during breakfast the hotel has a laundry room also which was very convenient for us as we stayed there for 6 nights and didnt have to go out for doing our laundry breakfast buffet is amazing with a wide variety to offer though we have to wait for a while for the eggs as there are only 2 egg stations the swimming pool is small and located at the back of the hotel near the parking lot but we seemed to be having problems with our cards to enter the pool and had to always get someone from reception to open the gates would definitely;4
the hotel was great did not like the idea of the parking arrangements the valet guys were great excellent attitudes and explained in much more detail as i had a handicap placard and i thought parking should have been free;4
two friends and i recently went to manhattan for 10 nights and stayed at the days inn on broadway i had read a lot of reviews on here previously and did not know what to expect but i was pleasantly surprised we had missed our connection flight and missed a night there i called them to let them know and they kept our room no problem once we got to new york everything went smoothly we stayed in a renovated room on the sixth floor which for a two star hotel was pretty impressive especially in size the beds were always made when we got back for the night along with clean towels which is all we really needed it is situated in a great place right by a subway station which was really handy they also had a number of restaurants cafes a 24hour cvs and a 24hour pharmacy;4
good location walk to central park museums 2 blocks from subway and on major bus routes choices of eating venues in the area barspubs and coffee venues the staff are courteous and helpful entire inn smells of pine sol so you know it is clean small bathroom but great shower;4
nice art deco hotel perfect location we had a suite on the 39th floor with breathtaking city views donât expect large rooms although the suites are big enough would stay there again on walking distance of central park time square and macyâs madison square garden just across the street donât forget to check whoâs performing while youâre there we saw the eagles and made great memories enjoy your stay;4
âairport hotels never fail to disappoint meâ is my usual stance however in this case i had to eat my own words the hotel did not disappoint me the room was modern light pleasant to the eye the bed and pillows nice the room clean and quiet the staff professional and helpful the breakfast nice the elevators swift and it was wonderfully close to the airport with the hotel shuttle will definitely consider staying here again if i have to catch an early flight from lax;4
the staff was super kind and accomodating and everything was pretty clean but the rooms and hallways were pretty rundown with cracking paint mildew smelling bathrooms and horrible lighting regardless for the price id definitely stay here again if i was in the area because the price was so affordable;4
hotel was well maintained rooms were contemporary and clean decent complimentary breakfast and an awesome pool i mean ofc the neighborhood isnt gonna be so great near korea town and all butits not the worst and during the day youre fine especially safe once on hotel groundslocation central to walk of fame griffith park lacma only real downside to my stay wasnt that big of a deal service was very polite but not genuine you could tell theres a little friction between workers and that some dont enjoy their jobs to the fullest extent you know it just seems like theres the please the customer even if you dont want to mentality among all of them if you know what i mean as i said not really a big deal would stay again would recommend to others;4
we stayed here for 8 days and it was very expensive the room was so small there was hardly any room to walk around the bed to get to the bathroom no tea or coffee facility to make a nice hot drink was so annoying having to go from the 42nd floor i believe we was on to go down and out to get a coffee security was really good there was a very hot guy on reception and i kept flirting with him and he flirted back nice hotel just not worth the money they ask for oh yeah hard to receive a wifi signal so high up too;4
i stayed here for 4 nights as part of a large conference staff were lovely throughout and i loved my room â big bright and spacious excellent location right next door to universal studios i walked there twice â just to wander and scope things out a generally comfortable stay though there are a few negatives i wanted to point out that didnât make the stay âperfectâ there are no microwaves in the guest rooms nor even a communaluse one in the lobby â staff did offer to bring one to my room â¦ for an additional 25 the gym is far too small for a hotel of this size a small sign says â8 max in the gym at all timesâ but youâll be there with 20 othersâ¦ it needs wipes in the weights room and there are no stretchingyoga mats thereâs no recycling bins â this is;4
overall it was a great base for exploring london the room was clean and breakfast was fantastic value at checkin i was using the automated system and following the instructions when a staff member snatched the room card out my hand and continued to finish off the process i didnt ask for help nor did i need it the room was also i bit chilly wed been out at christmas markets all day and were cold to start off with and just couldnt make the room warm up;4
if you intend to visit los angeles and would like to go to the universal theme park then this is a very convenient and relevant option numerous dining options are available at the city walk which is either a 10 minute walk or there is also the option of a free bus shuttle there are numerous options to also go to hollywood from the hotel such as the bus tours which is just a short ride to and from the chinese theatre;4
the inside of the hotel is very dim it needs to be brighter so that the guests arent afraid to walk down the halls alone breakfast is awesome but the chef automatically says omelet omelette regardless of you telling him 5x that you want scrambled eggs and he still makes you an omelette other than that the breakfast is great with all of the options available location is awesome but the paying for parking was crazy to me you could just park on the side street for free save 23 a night room was very very nice with a balcony i didnt like the fact that anyone on my floor could walk over to my balcony at anytime that wasnt cool but the other floors had private ones the russian girl at the desk gets an attitude sometimes and she claimed she couldnt do;4
we stayed here in april as a party of six women on a shopping trip from ireland we were offered a complimentary upgrade at checkin which resulted in a larger room with a second bathroom the staff were great especially the receptionists we also prebooked a private transfer from and to jfk with john in the hotelâs concierge service which turned out to be very reliable the hotel is in close proximity to the empire state building and macyâs furthermore the port authority bus station was only a 5minute walk for the day we went to woodbury common the hotel rate was very reasonable and the rooms clean but not fussy i would recommend to others particularly for shopping trips;4
i have stayed at the empire hotel many times its very reasonably priced and a good value for nyc great location friendly helpful staff i like the surrounding neighborhood in general and for accessing central park;4
my wife and i stayed last minute at the ameritania because of issues with traffic at laguardia we had to book it through hotelscom for a last minute stay the manager who checked us in was very nice it was a good clean room with a nice standup shower and surprisingly nice closet we were very pleased with the location for the price for sure especially for booking it the day of then;4
love the location of the empore hotel it is close to everything in ny the mall was close to there love access to the shops and bars we walked all the way down to time square it is a good ways down but better than taking the cab or train the room was pretty nice the bar in the hotel was nice too there was a video shoot that was going on in the morning when we were there too bad we did not get to go up to the roof top that night front desk did not tell us anything about roof top was closed we went up there and the door was locked that was the only bad thing that happened to us at the hotel we really booked the hotel because of the roof top view;4
very friendly valetbellhouse staff cant say the same for reception who were businesslike and uninterested we had a wonderful room on the 15th floor with plenty of room for messy teenagers and a lovely bathroom for me to hide in we overlooked universal and could watch much of the waterworlds show cool breakfast was extortionate outrageously huge and unecessary but maybe not if youre american;4
i stayed at the jane for a couple of nights in august 2012 all in all a good hotel and very different to the usual large corporate chain hotels you would normally find in such a city main points the staff were all pretty helpful i did feel kinda sorry for them dressed up in the old outfits but i guess it aims to add to the charm of the hotel i stayed in a captains room and whilst it is larger than the small cabin rooms its still a little pokey and probably a little difficult to relax in however in a city like ny most would aim not to spend too much time in their room so not really an issue it does impact on storage though so if you travel heavy be prepared to live out of your suitcase at least partially if the rooms are small the bathrooms are even;4
i was overall happy with our stay the staff was friendly and i think the free breakfast every day was a plus the omelette station was good but the pastries were stale didnt taste very fresh our room was clean however the outlets were horrible nothing would stay in the plugs my appliances just fell right out the only outlet that worked was the one in the bathroom overall the room was clean and looked nice after the cleaning people came and tidied up the room each day as for location its convenient to get to hollywood and there are several restaurants in walking distance i highly recommend renting a car because the public transportation would take you much longer to get anywhere even though traffic in la is horrible we never paid for parking at the;4
we stayed here for five nights and were very pleasantly surprized by pretty much everything about this hotel the staff were very friendly polite kind and helpful our room was larger than i expected having heard that nyc hotel rooms were quite small the best part of our room was the balconysuch a treat we just lucked out there the bed was comfortable with lovely white sheets and pillows the bedding was changed daily the bathroom although small was very clean this hotel clearly has an excellent housekeeping team great views of the nyc skyline and central park plus we got a really good deal on the room rate the neighbourhood was quiet and safe with the subway just three blocks away nothing is very far away once on the subway while not in the touristy;4
the rooms are rather small but adequate we did not have breakfast at the hotel because we did not want to be tied down by time but you can find many places to have breakfast nearby the hotel offers free coffee or tea in the morning we had a front room which was rather noisy the hotel is very central and was minutes away from times square;4
hotel very close to the airport however i never heard a plane which was surprising rooms are clean and have everything you need shuttle bus service is excellent they seem to be going constantly the staff are friendly and helpful seems to offer everything you need from an airport hotel i would stay there again;4
really nice and helpful the service at the hotel small but clean rooms the only real downside being the noise coming from the street i needed ear buds to sleep great location and amazing bar and cool restaurant always lively at diner time i would recommend it;4
good location not close from downtown but the 94th st subway station is 10 metres from the entrance of the hotel my room was clean quiet and in good shape the room was pricey 150 per night but a pretty good deal since i booked it at the last minute and most of the hotels were complete but dont expect a cheap nice place to stay during a december weekend in ny my recommendation is a go;4
lovely hotel with a great location only criticisms would be the temperature in the room was too hot so being able to manually alter this in the room would be good and also having free wifi in the hotel rooms would make the stay better as free wifi is standard in the uk;4
just returned from a 3 night stay here very quick and easy check in rooms are very small the shower is ok we only slept in the room so it was ok the lifts are slow but we were informed that they are spending 8 million dollars on an upgrade grab go breakfast is great to get you started for the day the lobby was always busy the staff are very friendly and helpful we liked the idea that you were checked for your room card before using the lift as security the location is excellent for seeing all of the sights see you again;4
i had to stay over for a work related event the hotel is centrally located next to lincoln center is is easily accessible by subway or nyc buses the room was modern and sleek the bed was comfortable while the room was small it fit my needs nicely the shower was good as well i would stay again;4
stayed in the hotel over christmas the staff were very good very quick to help the room was small but i understand that is the norm for new york the hole place is a bit on the dark side i think that they go a bit far with the mood lighting wifi is a bit if a issue there is free wifi in the lobby or you have to pay for it but if you are lucky your room will be close to the lincoln center and you can pick up there free wifi the mini bar is well stocked but it is not cheap and there is a shop just out side the hotel so there is no real need to use any thing from the mini bar there is no tea or coffee in the room but again there is a starbucks just out side the hotel and on ever street corner or seems like it there is a hair dryer and a umbrella in the room in all it was;4
would be hard to beat in terms of location being right beside penn station giving easy access to everywhere near and around times square decent sized clean rooms too and efficient check in with friendly staff there is a safe and hairdryers in rooms but not coffee machine or kettle although there are coffee facilities in lobby and a starbucks directly opposite we tried the tick tock diner attached but werenât impressed with the food here sorry;4
first timers didnt know the city didnt know what to expect from the accommodation pleasantly surprised friendly and polite staff couldnt do enough room was enough for our needs with a big tv dining room suite and a couch easy access to the subway and walking distance to the park and loads of bars and restaurants fridge and toaster so bagels and fresh oj from the local supermarket made nyc breakfast a real treat last day they had a baggage service for 5 dollars which was a godsend all in great experience;4
just returned after staying here for two nights hotel is 3 mins from times square location is perfect for broadway too staff is very kind and friendly and super helpful i emailed them a week before we arrived and asked a room with a view on the upper floor and they did everything we asked for so thank you again for that there are some complimentary tea and coffee in the morning and some snack after 4 room was basic but perfectly fine it was clean only the windows would need more regular cleaning it is a bit tired so that is why i have the 4 stars but the building is beautiful i wouldnât hesitate to stay here again thank you;4
i love that they offered a free shuttle to universal studios that drops you off right at city walk a lot of choices for breakfast at an affordable price the enclosed parking is also a nice security feature i highly recommend this hotel and will be returning again soon;4
had a lovely 2 night break here great location very central the hotel is like going back in time and im sure it was very grand once upon a time the rooms need updating and the bathroom facilities are to be desired i managed to set the fire alarm off after the room filled with steam after an attempt at getting the shower to a usable temperature the showerbath was at least 30 years old and in need of updating despite this we would stay again as the location was spot on and we didnt spend much time in the hotel itself;4
for the past three visits to book expo this has been my hotel of choice and every experience has been excellent before i start on my wordy review please keep in mind that this is a historic building fraught with the common layout of the times which means there can be small rooms and tiny bathrooms along with the continual maintenance issues that must plague an old building i had originally reserved a room with two beds about a week before my reservation i received an email with suggested upgrades and chose a room with two bathrooms for an additional 20 which turned out to be a good decision check in went smoothly with muhammed giving us a beautiful large room with two bathrooms but after spending a few minutes in the room realized there was some kind of;4
this hotel was quite nice 5 extra per day for them to valet park your car an added bonus we stayed here for 2 nights in apr 07 wonderful toiletries crabtree evelyn loved that clean and decent sized rooms very comfy beds w clean duvet covers every night and very soft location was pretty good we drove into downtown la hollywood blvd et in about 10 mins there are no restaurants within walking distance however we were quite happy with this hotel and would stay here again;4
we had a week in this hotel our first visit to new york as we had been warned that hotel rooms in ny are small and the beds likely to be too we upgraded there was no need to worry our son and his wife had a normal room the bed of which was king size the only difference between the rooms was that we had a wonderful though noisy view of broadway and the lincoln centre and they had a small courtyard which would have been quieter all in all the public rooms were spectacular and indeed have been used for film locations as seems to be the whole of ny our room was good bed very comfortable and so big that we had to phone each other to communicate well almost the downside for us was the bathroom which was quite small and tatty i cant imagine when it was last;4
we booked while driving into the city via hotwire its always a gamble but we were pleasantly surprised the location was awesome it was so convenient to everywhere we had to be there for a bachelorette bridal shower weekend the hotel was really nice the rooms were smaller obviously its nyc but had everything we needed and enough space for us to feel comfortable there is a hopping nightclub on the roof deck that i never saw or heard but always had a line the gentleman who helped us check in pasquale was exceptional given that there was a lot happening in the lobby a pageant or something and it was late he gave us a ton of information on the hotel the local area and recommendations nearby the only thing that stood out as negative was the valet definitely;4
the hotel was nice rooms are big and beds are comfortable there was a wide choice for breakfast the staff was very kind at all time especially nicole and beatriz who helped me a lot and we had a fun conversation greetings from rome;4
i stayed at this hotel during my first stay in new york my expectations were very high and i most say i didnt get disappointed eventhough i read alot of reviews saying that the hotel was dirty and the staff rude i liked my room very much it was beeing cleaned everyday the staff was sweet and helpful also when i got a package delivered at the hotels front desk i want to stay there again when i come back;4
enjoyed the convenience of walking distance to madison sq garden and macys also nice to have 24hr restaurant in lobby only negative was unavailability to check in early we understand it may not happen but why bother sending wyndham rewards members an email encouraging a 2pm early check in when clearly the likelihood is low we also thought the employee representing the rewards desk seemed uninterested and was literally on the phone while asking what we needednot friendly tried calling the hotel but still no success saw others in lobby waiting with us gets calls for early check in before us at the end of day we had a room at 4pm but maybe it should be made clear due to popularity that early check in is not likely at this location also this early check in piece;4
had a 12 hour layover at lax so checked in here very close to the airport and they provide a shuttle from lax to the hotel which is just a few minutes away nice rooms decent food options so much better than staying in airport all day;4
overall everything was fine friendly staff especially in reseption doormen were very helpful too room was clean and spacious there was fridge and closet which was great floor 35 with spectacular views;4
i did not hesitate to stay here again when returning to nyc and my friends enjoyed their stay here a beautiful art deco hotel it has a charm that more modern places lackthe location is excellent we stayed in an accessible room and had a nice bathroom as opposed to my last visit the staff was nice and vigilant sadly i found the beds very hard and uncomfortable but thats just me the tick tock diner connected to the hotel is okay but not fast the elevator to access it is not always functional and that caused some issues the butcher and banker restaurant is not a part of the hotel despite being located on the property if you need to reach them the hotel will not connect you it was open on christmas day and staying in the hotel area was quite nice the public;4
from the moment you enter you are greeted by staff and they will help direct you reservations was efficient and congenial i was arriving late due to coming from a trade show directly but they had my reservation correct room ready and all was well i was meeting a relative so i wanted to settle quickly found my room and it was surprisingly nicely done for the price of this midtown hotel the place was entirely clean not dusty and no sign anyone else had been there the housekeeping staff did a fine job everything was properly clean folded tucked and set up for my stay i packed away my gear and headed out to dinner i did want to report that their safes do not hold more modern computers or widescreen ones no matter what you do fortunately i felt it was fairly safe;4
the staff was always nice to us ready to answer questions and explain how to go somewhere we wanted to go the room was good for us the bathroom had some details to get renewed the pool was clean the sauna was fine once its heated the sauna shower is not practical needs to keep been pushed to work and no warm shower afterwards and room to rest i would have liked to have a bathrobe breakfast very good only little selection of teas;4
being a poor student i needed last minute cheap accomodation in a safe area of nyc after my previous plans fell through the jane definitely delivered the location is amazing and safe and it only takes about 57 mins to walk to the 14th street subway station where you can take the a c or e train uptown or downtown to explore the cities sites or the l line to brooklyn i walked home by myself late at night from the subway and felt perfectly safe the corridors do smell of cigarette smoke but my room didnt and its worth noting that the rooms are small and get quite hot but this easily fixed by the fan or aircon the bathrooms are clean and the housekeeping staff are respectful and very thorough the staff are extremely friendly and i had a 45 min conversation one night with;4
all in all this is a very good hotel probably one of the best in its kind it has great value for money is full of charm and has a great polite smiling staff we stayed in a captains cabin which was large well enough situated on the corner but unfortunately we had a lot of noise from the outside traffic;4
this hotel is perfectly located to everything we arrived to a welcoming clean air conditioned room would have given a higher rating but was disappointed on our last day after a long day out we wanted to rest up before heading out again it was 4 pm and our room hadnât been serviced yet we had to sit in the lobby and try to stay awake that was a bit disappointing i wouldnât recommend eating breakfast here eithercostly and below average food make sure you say hi to jeff at the door he would have to be the nicest man in new york jeff is full of local knowledge and more than happy to help you out what an asset he is to this hotel;4
very nice hotel for the prices they offer you will see central park as soon as you get out of the hotel it is a bit far to downtown manhattan but not too far to the empire state building and to time square;4
this was my second stay at the jane and its now the only nyc hotel for me i dont mind a shared bath and the bunk bed rooms are tinysee more about captains room below but its perfect for a solo traveler especially one that has far more planned in nyc than being in a hotel room the bathrooms are cleaned 247 the rooms are pristine the staff really takes care of the hotel free bottled water free wifi crisp cotton robes plentiful towels and slippers in every room no closet but plenty of hooks on walls and door and drawers under the bed i wonder if the bellhop would store your empty suitcase for you to keep it out of the way itd be worth asking as the staff is sooooo accommodating did i mention free bike rentals with the trail up and down the hudson;4
we had quite a large room with a nice view thanks to mohammed at the reception desk the hotel is just a short walk away from times square and the empire state building to name but a few places which are a must to visit friendly and helpful personnel;4
loved the nostalgia of the hotel the beautiful lobby the updated beds the history museum downstairs all very nice front desk staff always more than accommodating we had a room with a balcony which was a real treat being able to step out on the 22nd floor and having a pretty cool view of the nyc skyline was a real treat;4
rooms are great very clean comfortable and well sized location is really convenient too with 23 metro stations within a few minutes walk staff are welcoming and very accommodating will definitely return on my next work trip;4
nice rooms good service wish it was less expensive for parking no major complaints that hotel was clean nice no issues shuttle service runs to and from the airport was convenient only really hoped that the nightly parking wouldâve been a bit cheaper but you canât have everything;4
stayed at the jane in january great quirky place with over the top decor in the public areas i had a captains cabin which had plenty of room and of course an ensuite the shower was fantastic staff were friendly and helpful my room was on the 2nd floor and the heating cannot be regulated by yourself on that floor apparantly had a couple of probs with it too warm one evening mentioned it at reception problem solved awoke one morning at about 0300hrs freezing no extra blankets so sufferred till morning should have probably rung reception but you know have fed this back to management seriously though these things didnt really bother me enough to not go back or recommend the place great location in a nice quiet neighbourhood i had no probs with noise from;4
the jane is an experience by itself like taking the orient express train you will be welcomed and ushered by a groom with full costume the rooms are tiny but you know what to expect it is very clean and that includes bathroom and restrooms quiet and there is heaps of storage in this room its really like staying in a train the decor is nice and the staff very friendly you can see they are happy to work there the receptionist was doing a happy dance until she realises i was watching her the restaurant is nice but noisy try the couscous safe area and about 7 min walk to the metro highly recommended for a solo traveller who wants a short stay without spending all your money;4
we stayed here for four nights and were pleasantly surprised at how nice it is the rooms are fairly small but theres enough room to put your stuff and for a quick trip to nyc you dont get chance to spend a lot of time in the room my only slight niggle about the place was the speed of the lift it was agonisingly slow;4
i found the hyatt regency near lax to be very clean with relatively new furnishings and facilities it is very convenient to lax if you are returning a rental car only about a mile away i was not impressed with the lobby bar chilly and not wellappointed i also think a hotel should provide their guests with free nonvalet parking which this hyatt did not do overall though i thought this hyatt was a very good experience;4
very nice room and very friendly staff at this hotel good location with some shops nearby we had a great time in new york for my wifeâs birthday we would definitely stay here again and we would definitely recommend;4
nice hotel in times square penn station and madison square garden are steps out the entrance the minute you walk out of the hotel you are in the thick of nyc people and action everywhere morning and night if you are looking for a quiet location this is not it we heard that the rooms are small but we stayed the new yorker twice in june and both times had large by nyc standards rooms possibly because we are wyndham rewards members the rooms were updated and well appointed the bathrooms are very small however with only elbow room and not space to keep a toiletry bag other on a towel shelf other than that the room was great if you want to be in the center of nyc action as well as a nice hotel for a reasonable price the new yorker is it;4
nothing was too much trouble especially when i asked if a room upgrade was available pasquale could not have been more helpful went out of his way to ensure we received a more suitable room the hotel decor is very 30s and a little frayed at the edges but this didnt detract from a very enjoyable stay;4
me and my wife with our son and daughter aged 15 and 16 stayed in this hotel for 8 nights the room was a good size room for a family just the bathroom was a bit old if not everything else is excellent the location itself was great just 15 minutes walk to time square and all the shopping are just very close to the hotel empire state building was very close just a few minutes walk the underground train station is just down the corner the location was just fantastic the hotel staffs are very welcoming which is an extra one can just stay in this hotel for its location and for an excellent customer service a very good hotel for a family there was security always making sure that only the guest enters the hotel room overall the staffs and the location of the hotel made;4
really enjoy our stay great location the staffs are very helpful special thanks to krystle at the front desk;4
room was reasonably clean good size shower and bedroom we could even fit the babycot ij between the double bed bed was a bit too soft foe my liking i like the location its very near to central park and 15 minutes walk to times square i like it because its onbthe quieter side of town would be more packed if it was any nearer to times square we requested for a baby cot and it was readily available in the room reception and concierge was very friendly and helpful theres free coffee and tea every morning at the reception which was nice hot and iced water also provided at the water station at the lobby this was convenient for us as we constantly needed hot water for the baby housekeeping missed cleaning the room once or twice the whole week we were there but;4
the new yorker is located closed to macys and is convenient to the subway this is a clean hotel beds are comfortable staff is friendly and i feel safe when traveling here it has alot of history keep in mind that it is an older hotel and the bathrooms are very small;4
the hotel is right across the street from central park and is quiet our room was large for an inexpensive hotel and the bathroom was renovated the staff was also friendly the only reason to not give the hotel 5 stars is that the hallways are drab and the elevator is slow but the bottom line is that we will definitely stay here again;4
far enough from the nyc bustle yet blocksminutes from public transportation and the treasures of nyc this is what the jane offers by way of location the nautical theme and story behind its architectural design is unique the abundance of intricate woodworking antique furniture oldfashioned staff uniforms is another charm the adjoining restaurant although not owned by the jane offers an array of tasty menu items the cocktail lounge is a step back in time yet particularly trendy it seems the hot spot the jane has many international guests many of whom are younger than 30;4
we were a bit surprised by the fee to hold our bags before we could get the keys to our rooms 5bag for only 10 more we could have gotten early check in ms henry at the information desk was great with suggestions on nearby places to visit before getting our keys the room was clean and the bed was comfortable we were on the 37th floor with a nice view of the empire state building and the chrysler building the hotel is within easy walking distance of times square rockefeller center and bryant park;4
i have stayed at the hilton universal for business and pleasure each time it has been amazing great staff the rooms are wonderful the beds are so comfy it is hard to get up i love staying on the higher floors facing universal studios and the mountains the only thing i didnt care for is there is not a large variety in food and they cater to the asian cuisine but other than that i cant wait to stay again;4
this hotel is conveniently located in the heart of ny the staff were overly helpful and friendly;4
we stayed for four nights in two rooms one standard queenqueen and one executive king room pros the rooms were both clean and spacious the bathrooms were wellappointed and the water pressure was fine there were plenty of electrical outlets the safe was large enough for a laptop computerthe inroom pod coffee maker and refrigerator were a nice convenience not always found in upscale hotels why is it the most expensive hotels are the least generous with this type of amenity the bed at least in the king roomi didnt sleep in the queen beds was comfortable and the linens were nice the executive king room had a sitting area with a sofa and chair and coffee table an extralarge bathroom with a vanity area and some extra bath items the location is convenient to;4
the location was great and the roomprice ratio worked for a last minute visit to clients in manhattan the staff particularly nick did everything to make sure my five days intended plus one additional day due to the weather was comfortable during the crazy weather when cabs were not an option i was able to walk two blocks to the subway and make it to an appointments quickly while coffee in the room was not an option it is next to a starbucks the only complaint was in obtaining ice and other items for ones roomit is better to go down to the lobby or restaurant as the vibe is great and the service is prompt;4
we stayed here for one nightthe buffet was amazing and included lobsterthe pool was really nice and location is good for universal studios 5 min walk or take the shuttle walk to metro to go hollywood blvd great king room with awesome view;4
jessica at concierge saw we would be here a week and gave us a room with a small view on a higher floor it was very appreciated the gentlemen in the lobby who made sure only guests had access to the elevators were pleasant and made us feel secure the beds in our room were comfortable our bathroom was spotless even if the fixtures were retro and seemed incredibly dated with antique looking knobs both penn station for the train and the subway were in the same block macys bryant park times square rockefeller center were all an easy walk we were on the 36th floor loved the street noises when we opened the windows just a few inches could see the hudson river and madison square garden it was a great place to stay;4
location fab bed extremely comfortable staff polite and helpful rooftop bar is fantastic room was a little tired but always clean great location and nice styling must check out rooftop bar and their asian margherita was amazing would recommend;4
i understand that these rooms get a lot of traffic but out room was tired carpet was probably 68 months overdue for replacement wall paper was close to gross in spots room was as clean as it possibly got be staff was awesome stay was nice kids loved pool area;4
this was a 40th birthday trip to me from my husband and we had an amazing time it was our second time to nyc and a different hotel it was very nice great location nice size rooms and pleasant staff we had a few concerts and dinners booked and used the subway or walked to most places we also got the subway from the airport and it brought us right out at the hotel the bar in the evenings or when jet lag set in was perfect quiet but a nice atmosphere we never ate at the hotelits new york so many wonderful places to eat and see cant wait to return in the future;4
i would have given this hotel a 5 rating except for the attempt to charge us an extra 22 plus tax a night facility fee when we had already paid in full through our travel agent after i complained they removed it but it left a sour taste in what had been a most enjoyable stay apart from that the hotel is beautiful but then i like deco we had a large room with two comfortable double beds looking straight at the empire state building down 34th st the tick tock diner is a delight and we found the staff to be friendly and helpful the central location is ideal for the tourist we really enjoyed it and we would stay here again;4
the hotel is classic modernized but keeping the style of the 1930s it is centric and really close to madison square garden and times square has a metro entrance on the corner as well our initial room was very very small we have two big suitcases and couldnt fit them in the room we asked for a change and they helped us get a bigger room without a problem the other issue i would point out was that the bathroom was freezing all the time and the shower head didnt have enough pressure honestly said it was a great stay the only annoying thing was the bathroom however if we had stayed in the smaller room it would have been a problem because of its size;4
we had a very nice room which was larger than expected and we were very happy to stay there no issues except the windows in the room let in a bit of a breeze but the hotel is old good location if you want to stay in midtown and do lots of walkinggetting the subway not many amazing places to eat nearby but subway is next to the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly would have no hesitation recommending this hotel;4
ill start with the bad points just to get them out of the way the rooms are very small as in cant open your suitcase small that being said the jane is in a great location the shared bathroom was spotlessly clean the robes and towels smelled fresh and the staff were friendly and helpful;4
we loved our stay at the empire it is situated in our favourite nyc area the lowerupper west side very convenient for lincoln center columbus circle whole foods and shops and to the new century21 store the rooms are nicely decorated clean comfortable and with enough space we were given rooms with views to lincoln center a lovely plus for us opera fans the lobby can get busy in the happy hour due to its bar but it is indeed a nice place for a drink;4
overall an excellent value and location for nyc beautiful lobby great friendly staff minor confusion at checkin but fixed quickly internet coverage was just ok room was very clean but bathroom sink and shower were significantly clogged and luggage rack was wedged in closet by iron position little annoyances but you cant find much better at this price;4
good value and centrally located for our needs rooms well maintained and fast service when issues were encountered great lobby bar and rooftop facility although it was cold unfortunately could not use the pool;4
enjoyed our stay quiet comfortable great view of city lights universal studios enjoyed looking out the window at the harry potter castle large room and bath peter roth bath amenities only downside was high cost of food in the cafe or also pricey room service citywalk is only an 8 min leisure walk plus a shuttle is available may restaurants there;4
my second stay at the empire and love the location close to central park and columbus circle be sure to request a room with a view and not the interior rooms they feel like a cave friendly staff and helpful bellman out front overall good hotel;4
we stayed here for 4 nights at the start of april 2022 all of the staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful the room was a bit small for 3 people sharing there was very little space to unpack or even lay out our suitcases the diner on the ground floor is good and the fitness suite has reasonable facilities it was really easy to walk to all of the main attractions in new york and is also close to a subway station advice for buying souvenirs like hoodies buy on a weekday itâs much cheaper would stay again;4
the hotel says that it was completely renovated in late 2009 when we stayed in early 2010 our room was very clean newly decorated and newly furnished the common parts of the hotel even the back stairs were also clean and newly painted the rooms are small but excellent value and very well located if you want to be in the heart of downtown manhattan our room on the top floor had two small double beds sufficient for two couples of normal size but not perhaps for very fat people it had a desk a chest of drawers and a new sony flat screen tv there was a lobby with hanging space and a clean newly equipped bathroom bath with shower over the room had a safe there was one chair but little space for anything more the hotel had very recently installed wireless internet;4
we recently stayed at the empire hotel for two nights upon arriving we checked in and were told there was a complimentary upgrade to a superior king room we originally booked a queen room which was a nice surprise the room was very clean but small which we expect when staying in new york city the housekeeping staff was very helpful when a breaker went out in the roomtoo many things onplugged in at once in an old hotel housekeeping saw my concern and got an employee to assist right away only a few minutes and our power was back on we did not eat in the rooftop bar but i recommend visiting especially for happy hour drinks are on special and the view is really cool be sure to check the times for happy hour i visited the fitness center on one occasion but;4
we had a fabulous stay booked 2 rooms king adjoining 2 queen for my daughters 11th birthday she had received her invitation to hogwarts by owl and we needed to get up there asap unfortunately the la traffic delayed us and we missed going in friday night my daughter was distraught but the front desk was fabulous laura comped us breakfast for the next morning and sent up a lovely birthday card to brighten the evening the rooms are stylish beds heavenly and decor up to date it is a bit pricey but i guess its locationlocationlocation 5 minute walk to the entrance of the park and the shoppingeating area well definitely be back thank you hilton;4
2nd stay in this hotel 20 years on from my first stay receptionlobby area is always busy with guests loitering around i liked the security to the lifts lucky enough to get a room on the 23rd floor with a view of the empire state tick tock diner was great but needs more staff in the evening as service could have been quicker location of this hotel is perfect 5 min walk to the empire state and macys 20 mins to times square 30 to central park you couldnt be better placed if you tried plenty of shops and eateries around the area too the bathrooms are in desperate need of upgrading that should be a priority for the wyndham they look shoddy and about ready to fall apart we struggled to keep the floor dry even when aiming the shower head at the wall this wouldnt;4
from check in to check out everything was smooth the beds were comfy and the room clean the bell staff was great in storing our baggage for both early and for late checkout and very prompt when we checked in getting them to our room;4
this hotel was not the newest but for its age is very well kept particularly good breakfast for a free one good service well located for hollywood;4
the rooms are very small though clean we spent minimal time in the room we borrowed the free bikes from the hotel to take us around manhattan the hotel is quite well placed on the west side close to great running routes along the hudson river close to good restaurants and metro;4
the hotel best selling point is its location 1 block from macys across the street from msg and a 15 minute walk to empire state building we had no issues with the staff they were always polite we were offered an upgrade and negotiated a better deal for the 8 nights we stayed our room was on 31st floor it was a good size had room and even a fridge the view of the empire state building was fab the bathroom it definitely needs a makeover it was dated and not great the biggest issue is their facilityresort fees of 31 a day its a complete and utter rip off how the state is allowing hotels to charge these fees is beyond me for the fee you get use of the business centre gym and their free wifi shocking;4
stayed at the new yorker in march just as carona virus was about to hit possibly not the best time to visit new york but didnt queue to visit anything which was great the new yorker hotel was very clean and the location couldnt have been better just up the way from the empire state building and central for all the sites we wanted to visit we were on the 34th floor of the hotel the room was very clean but also small but ideal for a long weekend which we were doing for my wifes birthday with friends the staff were all friendly and gave us the best routes to take we had planned to walk to the statue of liberty which we did the first full dayabout 6 miles each way walking along the hudson river to keep away from crouds and took in the sights along the way second full;4
as long as you know that this place is a serviced apartment and not a regular hotel you should have a satisfactory stay like i did the price was very inexpensive for such a large apartment since youre not paying for all the extra hotel services and the upper west side area is great there are very few tourists around so you really get a feel for what its like to be a new yorker the location is very convenient the red 123 line subway station is less than a block away that subway line will take you to midtowntimes square in about 10 minutes so the major attractions are easy to get to a cab ride from penn station cost us less than 20 there is a very large grocery store about 2 blocks away and there are nice shops all over such as a north face store that is down the;4
this hilton is a nice hotel the staff is friendly they had a very good breakfast layout the room was spacious and the blackout curtains were very nice it is in walking distance to the main entrance to universal studios i would come back to this hotel;4
excellent location amazing servicesmall and charming boutique hotel really enjoyed my stay hereand got amazing service which is to me one of the most importanti recommend this hotel to all;4
we enjpyed the location of the facility to the goings on we enjoyed the staff and we were pleased with our stay we would definitely stay again we have stayed a few different places when going to new york city and this was one of the most smooth stays;4
the hotel is perfectly situated in manhattan they have a nice bar and mezzanine where you can meet friends old and new the staff are very friendly and helpful they are next to clarks and eds chowder house i had a blast at eds the food drink wait staff were all exceptional the only issue i had was in our bath it was a bit undersized otherwise i wouldve given empire a 5;4
after booking 3 nights online at this hotel we happened upon tripadvisors website were very concerned about all the negative comments thankfully we went ahead with our stay there and were very pleasantly surprised because we had none of the problems others experienced the staff was very helpful and friendly at all times the room was spotless and extremely comfortable the breakfast was perfectly acceptable we walked around the neighborhood comfortably and ate at several local restaurants with no concerns the pool was great those who said there wasnt a pool on the premises should have asked the front desk or read the material provided housekeeping was never a problem we definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again in the future;4
this friendly hotel is very conveniently located in midtown manhattan just 200 metres or so from the nearest subway at 34th streetpenn station so handy for the a c e lines uptown or downtown and also for the journey right out to the airtrain to jfk airport the room was clean and the ensuite bathroom was fine the only negatives were a lack of storage place for clothes as there were very few drawers and a rather inconsistent wifi signal the staff were very helpful including informing us of the airport shuttle service and so saving us money rather than booking a taxi the local area is full of bars delismarkets and places to eat in particular there is one of the best pizza places in the whole of new york just 50 metres around the corner on 8th avenue make every;4
good front officenice locationvery good breakfast thanks for my frind huggonear too metro stationvery saftyi spent 14 days without any problemsclose to supermarketsfashions storsfinaly every things oknext visit to us ill be there;4
good quality hotel in key location if visiting universal or north hollywood area excellent rooms and large comfortable beds also blinds cut out all day light car park a little pricely but no other options only let down by overtly complicated and hence long booking and checking out procedures there is no need to show people to the levator each time also let down by costly wifi;4
the new yorker proved to be a nice stay itâs not a 4 star hotel but for the price it offers a great location with instant access to the subway the staff was excellent and bent over to take care of us;4
dont pay attention to all of the picky reviews its so easy for people to sit behind a screen and complain we had a very positive experience and will return to this hotel thank you to dennis one of the doormen who saved our trip from the very beginning we left our wallet in the cab and he noticed it as he was helping unload our bags what a nightmare that could have been;4
the hilton universal is a very nice hotel with a great location if you are going to universal studios we stayed two nights and overall enjoyed our stay the only problems we had were with the beds doubles instead of queens i probably should have looked more closely at my choices when booking and parking i did not valet and had to circle the garage for about a half hour to find a spot they had a large conference or wedding going on and the parking was taken by that overall though we enjoyed our stay here and would probably book again;4
located right next to los angeles intl airport the hotel offered me a comfortable room with ac cable tv good shower and all it seemed to be in renovation when i was there and besides the room there wasnt much else to do at the hotel and i dont think it needed they also offer a complimentary shuttle to the airport;4
the days hotel is well located close to many restaurants and subway stations our room was nice the only thing i would suggest is a good carpet cleaning as most guests walk around with shoesboots cable tv was functional as was the ac not too noisy in room safe was extremely convenient as was the wifi which isnt the fastest but very acceptable would definitely stay there again;4
we had been offered an online 20 upgrade to an executive room and accepted it the wait at the checkin desk was longer than it should have been but the clerk was courteous and efficient and we were pleased with our upgrade our room was larger than average lshaped with windows on two sides room was clean and beds quite comfortable the bathroom was barely big enough for one person to occupy it despite our efforts to prevent it the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor only about half of the elevators were operational but we understand that they are being replaced soon the revolving door was on the fritz too so staff had to man the doors to the vestibule and we got a wind tunnel trip every time we were there for the westminster show without a dog but it;4
we came for a new york thanksgiving and had the time of our lives2 blocks from the parade and restaurants galoreamazing hotel and staff front desk personnel were impeccable and my children were so taken with the doorman tommy or uncle tommy as they called him that my wife spoke several times about hiring him away from your hotel hang on to him hes a gem we will be be booking again for next year and look forward to seeing more of your wonderful hotel and city bill p;4
on the hilton 800 number we reserved a package with 2 universal studios tickets and breakfast tickets we were told the first nite would be at the higher rate the 2nd at a aaa rate at checkin the front desk said our rate was the higher rate for both nites it was fixed after i questioned it we requested extra pillows and towels ahead of time on the hilton honors site we had to call housekeeping to get these they said that they were full and could only bring 2 pillows the room only had 3 bath towels we had to request extra each day also our reservation was for 4 people the room was clean and looked like the hotel web site pictures the carpet was very worn and spotty it did feel clean though the tv was small and older the double beds were comfortable;4
we stayed at this hotel as the first part of our honeymoon it is in a great location just off times square the staff were great but as with all hotels in new york the noise from outside did keep us awake;4
the staff was extremely helpful when we asked how to find our way around manhattan i was impressed with the concierge service they seemed to know the neighborhood we needed a flower shop the room was small but clean i think ours had been recently updated great location close to theatre district and transportation right next to penn station from our point of view it was a great location the only downside was the room size but that was a minor issue;4
great location and great looking hotel excellent deco through the entrance area good room size and no city noise room was clean couldnât fault the cleanliness restaurants on your doorstep and central park 2 mins away;4
hotel was a perfect location for my needs staff was friendly and helpful room was nice except for a couple of odd issues no convenient place to plug in charger bathroom door was cracked and chipped though bathroom had been nicely renovated i would stay there again;4
after extending our trip to san francisco by another day with no problem in changing our reservations we arrived a little ahead of schedule and were accommodated with a room right away we used the valet parking which was not that much more than the self park and was much cheaper than the san francisco hilton valet the staff were all very professional and seemed very genuine we received a great offer through the concierge for entrance to universal studios for two days for 80 person which was a great savings and very convenient as it was across the street from the hotel and proved to be a very nice view our room was a large corner suite that we added a cot for our teenage daughter we went out for a while that evening and came back to a welcoming fruit tray with trail mix;4
this was our first time at the hotel it was a very nice property and the location to universal studios was awesome a quick 5 minute walk easy walk for the 4 of us it made it easy to leave the park mid day and rest a little at the hotel before heading back our room was park view and it was nice great view of the castle in the world of harry potter extremely comfy beds nice bathroom and a good work refrigerator we were very happy with the staff upon check in she was very friendly and helpful we were very happy with the property the only complaint i have about the entire stay was when one of the desk staff hung up on me our the morning we went to the park we woke up at 630 that morning to ice cold water and no tv we had a family of 4 that had to shower so i;4
we stayed there for one week and enjoyed our stay very much the hotel is located near the central park and you can also make a walk to times square in about 20 minutes it was a perfect located hotel for us and of course the staff in the hotel is also very helpful;4
its a great location in easy walking distance from penn station and madison square garden the hotel felt safe which as a female solo traveler is one of the most important things i look for in a hotel the staff was great the rooms are small but i didnt spend much time in it anyways the wifi was free as with all boutique hotels id recommend google street viewing it before you go as like many boutique hotels the sign and entrance isnt as obvious as corporate hotels;4
a great hotel prime location comfortable and friendly i have been a regular guest here and often find great deals on rooms the beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are always spacious the only thing that could be improved is the gym;4
i stayed two nights and would stay here again the room king was spacious and had a great view it was very clean and had great appointments and decor i used the pool and bar and enjoyed them both the pool was very nice but not anything special the staff was great very helpful and accommodating i was visiting someone in burbank so this was a great location;4
location is perfect such a fun place to stay stayed four times this year and going back in march staff was helpful and friendly we had a problem with the air conditioning the evening we arrived and it was taken care of by the time we got back from dinner it is a happening place and i look forward to going back;4
history and efficiency ooze from this place built in the heyday of deco architecture the lobby retains elements that remind you of a bygone era i last stayed here in 1994 when the property was sorely in need of renovation recent upgrades made by wyndom and other owners have transformed rooms and public areas from tattered to first class but not deluxe the lobby always felt crowded as if it were an extension of penn station conviently just 1 block away the reception also felt understaffed as a line to check in seemed to always exist but if you need a transportation super location you can hardly do better with subway ce entrances on either side of the front door a stoneâs throw from penn station and easy walking tofrom the port authority depot at 42nd;4
i had a very good experience except for three things the hotel misrepresented its proximity to the major hollywood attractions on the web site it is not a short mile nor is it walking distance to hollywood blvd highland ave you have to take a 10minute subway ride and walk a block to the metro on santa monica blvd vermont the computer available for guests is older it froze many times and you cannot print or save files to the desktop or documents folder the hotel should consider upgrading and offering a business center so guests can print their own airline passes maps and coupons lastly there is no indoor pool for use on cooler days;4
the empire is a nice hotel in an excellent location near lincoln center and central park the rooms are very small but also very clean rooftop bar is nice spot but the service is very subpar no servers had to go to a cash register to place an order;4
i had read the reviews a couple of days before arriving at the hotel and was extremely worried as my mum was used to above average hotels i had nothing to be worried about i had a great time staying at this hotel granted the room was small but we spent only 68 hrs there max a day for sleep and a shower the toilets flushed we had hot water and an air conditioner for that one hot night the staff was more then helpful i approached them at checkin with a positive attitude and they were extremely friendly there is a great diner around the corner the key west diner and we had breakfast there every day with reasonable prices and with customer service you cant beat the subway is right across the street and if you take the express its only 2 subway stops to 42nd;4
just got back from staying at the empire hotel which ive stayed at before we checked in around 1pm and our room wasnt ready but check in is at 3pm so all good our checkin was very nice sorry didnt get her name but she was very friendly the location is great just across from lincoln center and 2 blocks from central park before we were going to dinner and a show we stopped in to the lobby bar around 330 and what a wonderful time we had kenny our bartender was fabulous we were talking about everything and all the while hes serving the tables and being the best bartender you could want the empire is very lucky to have him i would go back to the bar even if i were staying somewhere else sometimes this lovely hotel does not have availability when im;4
as opposed to some recent reviewers of this hotel we felt wed made a very good choice for our onenight stay my husband was scheduled for a medical procedure at kaisers sunset vermont hospital early on a morning when rain was expected so we decided that rather than brave the congealed traffic wed face driving in from las west valley on that morning wed come into hollywood the night before stay over a friend recommended loews hotel near hollywood highland but when we realized wed have to pay 250 parking we looked elsewhere with the auto club discount our room at the hollywood hotel was well under 100 for the night plus we had free parking in the gated lot a free hot breakfast served early enough 630 to allow me to eat before we went off to the;4
this hotel is great for visiting universal however not the greatest value or service i have encountered i used hilton points for a 3 night stay for a family 2 adults and 2 older teens at 50000 points per night for this we got a reasonable sized 2 queen bed room at check in the hotel informed me that i had booked 1 night in a universal view room and the other two in a standard i said that i did not want to move room and would be happy if they could put us in a standard for the 3 nights to which i was advised that although it was early the allocations had been made and we would have to check out of 1room and in to the other the following day it took a request to see the manager to resolve this issue but we finally did secondly we were advised that as a hilton diamond;4
just returned from our second visit and stay at the new yorker which tells a story in its own right great location in the heart of mid town close to empire state building madison square gardens times sq ten min walk we were given a great room overlooking the esb and madison sg we did e mail ahead to ask for this room was nice quite spacious which was a surprise based on previous visits to nyc only disappointment was the bathroom which was a little tired and in need of upgrading minor thing in the grand scheme of things all staff were very helpful and we had no issues what so ever the tick tock diner is a convenient eating place that serves 24 hours a day but better value and quality can be found within a couple of blocks walk not withstanding we ate;4
stayed at the empire for 6 nights in december in the double queen room and enjoyed my stay here all the staff in the hotel were very helpful and pleasant expect for one receptionist but theres always one so that didnt bother me so much yes the shower leaks over slightly and hotels could do with a slight revamp but its not as drastic as other reviews make out also the housekeepers informed me of the renovations and how good they were looking already on higher floors when i got to the empire i was looking for all the things ive read in the reviews but i failed to find any room service was quick and tasty and cocktails were good too the only complaint i do have is that you can get better value for money in new york i was satisfied with the hotel but met other;4
great to see a concert at msg lots of places to eat and shopping nearby no fridge in room only downside very strict security code hat monitors the door three restaurants on site that were very good;4
this is very different property the restaurant area is under construction so the bar area and hall way doubles as the restaurant inconvenient when you are trying to walk through the area but not a total turn off check in was quick and we were able to get rooms next to our daughterss the elevators are slow but during peak travel times they have an employee in the elevator lobby and one in an elevator to speed things up one woman told us that she had been coming to the hotel for five years and the elevator was always slow the rooms were nice but the hot water was spastic and it was hard to set and forget the faucet also the hotel is in la so the low flow shower head was like a light rain enough to get you wet just not enough to do the job in a short time;4
just back from the empire absolutely loved new york and the empire provided the perfect base very close to the lincoln centre and in walking distance of all the main attractions apart from the 911 museum however the metro is literally across the road and the uptown tour bus stops outside so you can access whatever you need the hotel is clean and the staff are friendly polite and very helpful there are a couple of downsides the rooms are small but adequate for a short break and the cost of the mini bar items is extreme take your own travel kettle and pop the milk in the mini bar fridge so you dont pay three dollars for the coffee in the room the bar in the hotel is a bit pricey but comparable to other bars around the hotel get slightly off the beaten track and go to;4
a very well located hotel with overall good comfort and services we had booked a superior room on the 11th floor but which proved to be much smaller than expected although apparently normal for nyc only space enough for one person between the end of the bed and the tv table for example the main benefit was the view over the lincoln centre and broadway we would book again;4
great for tourists or visiting friends basic hostel accommodation and for â£18 a night you cant complain recently refurbished so still fairly well kept 24hr reception is very helpful hammersmith is an ok area and it only takes 30 minutes into central london;4
rooms are ok however it was the staff that made the trip great for us jeff the doorman was so nice and helpful also we had a mishap with our room at 4am and between the front desk staff and the engineer i cant remember his name but he was so great things were handled so well;4
the location is one of the main reasons to stay at this hotel easy access to the subway at both lincoln center and columbus circle the rooms are small though a decent size for ny but the bathrooms are tiny and difficult to move around in on our recent visit there were no washcloths or bathrobes provided when we arrived so we had to request them also the toilet stopper wasnt working properly so we had to manually adjust it to get it to stop not a huge deal but a pain to have to deal with when youre paying a lot of for a room and the drawers in the dresser between our beds wouldnt stay closed because the dresser wasnt level again a minor thing but a detail that id like to see the hotel care about there is a starbucks right around the corner for morning;4
stayed here 3 nights in november as part of a cruise package this hotel is in a great location for a stay in new york hotel is very large and very busywith a lovely reception area the room although quite small had all you needed for a short stay bed although was a double size was very comfortable and room was kept nice and clean shower was very good with lots of power the diner and the trattoria within the hotel were very good the lifts were security checked and very fast considering the number of floors covered wifi was very good would stay again if in new york;4
i spent a single night at the empire hotel at the end of october 2015 i requested an early checkin when i made my reservation that request was granted and i was pleased the downside of course was that very few rooms were available at 1000 am and i had a choice of a room on the first floor with no view and one on the eleventh floor that might be noisy because of its proximity to the barclub i opted for the room on the first floor not only was there no view the room looked out on the heating and cooling system the room was also incredibly noisy due to the endless clanking and hissing of the machinery thankfully the room itself was quite pleasant done in soothing tones of gold dark brown and tan the room was very clean and i liked everything about it;4
i had a great room bed and pillows were comfortable it was large by nyc standards there was a view from two sides and a refrigerator the hotel is slightly worn but a real gem bar mixed great drinks all hotel staff were kind and friendly wifi worked well safe in the room would stay again;4
perfect location great room views and walking distance from many sights friendly staff and check inout fast and easy coming from europe and being on a different clock i was very surprised and delighted to find a breakfast room open 5 in the morning traditional american menu with pancakes eggs burgers and the lot for breakfast great way to start the day very cool diner style interior as seen in movies i would not have raised an eyebrow if travolta walked in with a gun cool hotel logo font;4
after reading the reviews i was slightly dubious glad we stuck with it yes some rooms are slightly outdated bust you can upgrade to recently renovated ones yes room was slightly small but we were never in the room other to sleep and change fab location very clean staff friendly and a brill location new york was amazing;4
lovely clean hotel room was very small but very clean it did the job with friendly staff location was great near subways and bus stopswas central walk to times square and macys had a fab timewould stay here again;4
spent 10 nights at hotel was feeling a little alarmed after reading some of the reviews but i thoroughly enjoyed stay at days inn room and ensuite cleaned daily linen changed daily and was very clean so the layout of corridors was a little quaint there was a strange smell in corridors and they werent spotless and the place was a little aged the room was warm bed comfortable and size of room adequate the subway was so close plenty of restaurants in neighbourhood staff all were pleasant and helpful very quiet neighbourhood compared to near times square but everything very accessible price wise very good and i would recommend it;4
location location location this hotel couldnt have been better in terms of its proximity to universal studios hollywood the hotel does offer a shuttle that leaves every 15 minutes but its a 5 minute walk to get over to the main gate from a value perspective alone of not renting a car wanting to get to the park quick this place was great we were able to checkin early so we could leave our bags in our rooms for the day enjoy the park for the full time it was open and of course it was nice to be able to enjoy the city walk after our time in the park and then walk right back over to the hotel in minutes the price overall maybe not great but i really feel that the location offset it we chose to grab a coffee pastry from the little shop for;4
good location close to subway station from where you quickly can get anywhere on manhattan ans withon walking distance of china town and little italy friendly staff although a bit spartan given the cost its a good hotel from which to explore manhattan;4
we stayed here for one week great location for the attractions of los angeles staff super friendly and helpful breakfast buffet was expensive and there are better cheaper options nearby we liked bea beas the good neighbor restaurants which were both nearby rooms fine though not modern only negative was the lifts which took an age but the hotel was quite clear about this being work in progress to improve;4
we were in the city form oct 1316 and most of our activities were at lincoln center after reading the previous reviews my fingers were crossed about the empire our stay was great the deluxe king room was beautiful and the italian linens including the top sheet were a treat we had a view of lincoln center which we loved checkin and checkout were effortless and the staff incredibly helpful and pleasant we were on the 2nd floor and heard quite a bit of noise from the street but it is new york the proximity to the subway was convenient the concierge helpful with directions and eds chowder house amazing even a movie being shot in front of the hotel did not inconvenience us in any way thank you empire staff for a delightful experience;4
we stayed june 6th to the 11th dropping my daughter off at joffrey the hotel is very charming the lobby and lobby bar are on the small side so if you are looking for a massive resort style lobby you wont find that here we did enjoy our stay the front desk staff was accommodating but i would not say they went out of their way for anything but note that we did not need anything special and thus would not need for them to go out of their way i will say that the maid service was good we never ate at the empire restaurant but we did eat at pjs right next door which hosted from what we heard the tony awards after party which was very good and for 7 people with drinks and full dinner and tip it was under 300 which is a steal for the area the pool deck was;4
chose the hotel due to friends being in the area and the affordability the bunk rooms are compact but if like us you wont be spending too much time in your room the hotel is about a 1015 min walk to get to the nearest subway at west 14th but the route is pleasant via nice shops restaurants bars and sights of meat packing district alternatively a 5 taxi away otherwise walks to broadway downtown uptown via greenwich chelsea etc are nice too with lots to see on the way high lines and lively bars nearby make it ideal for getting back from a day out and heading out for dinner again the diner on west 14th highly recommended for late night feasts the shared bathroom was not a problem for us our main requirement was affordability cleanliness relaxed;4
great hotel located close to many attractions just know when they say 3pm checkin that is a firm time this was our second stay at the property the roof tip bar is a a great place to grab a drink or 2 and has very good views of the local area we would stay at the property again;4
stayed in this hotel hostel for the london film and comiccon with a friend was a little overwhelmed by the openness of the place since i am very nervous around new people and everyone there was a stranger shared a room with three other guys i had a surprisingly comfortable bunk bed though the squeakiness of the others was a little annoying the room was mostly clean no real issues despite mild noise from outside at night opening the room doors was at first troublesome due to the awkward key mechanism toilets and kitchen facilities were okay but the shower rooms were the worst part each shower had a different way of operating the floors were slippery and there was no where to put your clothes meaning you had to leave them outside the shower and someone could easily;4
our 1st time in nyc and the hotel could not have been better located for us family group of 7 close to central park the many metro lines at columbus circle to visitor attractions and 20 minute walk to times square along broadway or 8th avenue far enough away to avoid the thronging mass of humanity and noise associated with ts although the rooms are modest in size they are comfortable clean well equipped and towels changed daily without worrying about endangering the planet as in england bed very comfortable and room very quiet except for the racket made by the air conditioning unit surprised to find no complimentary coffeetea but available in room at a cost tv easy to work only major problem is no free wifi unless in the lobby surely this is a service guests now;4
its like living in ny close shops for shopping food 3 blocks to subway quiet loved zabars up the street right by cental park too lovely location away for hustle and bustle but not that far by subway totimes square;4
this hotel is situated very close metro station and hence conveniently located car parking is also big and there is a gas station close by rooms size is good only problem is not much space for wardrobe bed is quite comfortable swimming pool is good size and well maintained breakfast is sumptuous though there are occasional problem with supplieslike you may sometime have to wait for cutlery and coffee mugs etc they have a laundromat and a small store for immediate needs front office staff is nice i only hated the omelette live counter guy who acts too big for his boots chuck him out on the whole good experience;4
my partner and i stayed at morningside inn in september last year we were very happy with the location as it was only a short walk to the subway and central park we stayed in a double room with use of shared bathroom and kitchen facilities were basic no pots pans or cutlery in the kitchen and we could only get internet connection downstairs in the lobby we stayed for 4 nights and got a great nights kip every night as hotel is located off the main road in a quiet road perfect for travellers who like a bargain a great location and peace and quiet food shops and atm within 5 minutes walking distance;4
this was my fourth stay at this property that is adjacent to universal studios and the universal city walk this time i stayed four nights it offers great views across the hollywood freeway on one side and the studios and san fernando valley on the other service was excellent from bellman and valet to checkin to maintenance needed maintenance since for some reason we couldnt get the room to cool very well during the day i mention that because it was never really fixed but it was only a minor issue and prevented a fivestar rating rooms are great beds extremely comfortable breakfast buffet excellent 25 its the location however that sets the hilton apart easy walk to the studio tour and city walk short drive to burbank and studios room rates are very;4
we visited universal studios this summer three adults and three kiddos 11 11 and 8 and we bit the bullet even with aaa our room was expensive and paid for the hilton universal citys proximity to the park we just found it hard to find hotels rentals in striking distance and we searched in march for august stay it was an easy ten minute walk to the park universal citywalk or a quick shuttle ride we usually walked so we could leave when we wanted rather than wait around for shuttle our kids easily managed the walk even though it is a bit uphill the rooms were very nice beds comfortable plenty of space for three there was a desk and a view of universal the pool is big and the kids enjoyed the hot tub sun is lost by about 500 pm or so if you want a;4
i am sorry to see reviews that this hotel is somewhat run down because i was there a few years ago to go to the met and i loved the hotel we had the greatest room and it had a view of a mini statue of liberty on a roof nearby which was very humorous room was elegant bathroom nice lobby fine location wonderful;4
my son and i stayed here a total of two nights this hotel is in process of remodeling and our first night was in a before remodel room it was dated and in need of repairsimprovements but for a single night in new york it was perfectly adequate the bed was comfortable and we slept well the bathroom was clean and adequate if you are looking for granite countertops fancy sitting area and lots of space keep looking the room was about the size of a walk in closet but we didnt do anything there except sleep so not much room was required for the price we were quite satisfied our second night was in an after remodel room andwow room was still small holding a queen size bed and little else but again its new york and you shouldnt be holed up in a hotel;4
after booking last minute then reading reviews we were nervous however friendly helpful staff particularly helpful when we were struggling to get covid tests results back to fly home everywhere was clean we never waited more than a couple of minutes for the lifts ok so the rooms are a bit basic and tired but its the oldest hotel in new york theres history here and seriously do you come to new york to stay in your room the location is perfect for a tourist visit we would definitely stay again and recommend;4
in a city full of chain hotels the empire is a refreshing change the rooms are larger than the average nyc hotel the staff are friendly and the lobby bar has a great atmosphere the doorman treated us to magic tricks at the bar before his shift which was awesomebut our sever at the bar left much to be desired i was happy to see the elevators have been given a face lift but the beds and pillows definitely need to be upgraded they were very uncomfortable all in all its a great hotel and its location close to lincoln center was ideal for our daughters audition;4
this hotel needs modernisation the rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller the rooms are clean which is a plus the staff are friendly but as with a lot of hotels in the usa there arenât many amenities no room service no coffee facilities itâs quite close to time square only a short walk which is good if asked if i would come back to this hotel i wouldnât;4
my husband and i stayed for weekend gateway we had a great time the hotel is in a great location the view was spectacular the room was the perfect size not too big and not too small the king size bed was very comfortable the pool deck was very nice and cozy overall i would recommend this hotel to my friends;4
we stayed four nights at the empire and have stayed there several times in the past the location is awesomeplenty of dining and activities near by and central park really close staff extremely helpful we had a corner junior suite with wonderful views of lincoln center room clean bed super comfy bar lobby fun vibe with food offered and good drinks check out the rooftop bar too;4
we were delighted with our room very large two double beds and two bathrooms we stayed 5 nights and found the location excellent staff very helpful and restaurant excellent just a block from macys and near broadway this is such a central location;4
i loved the hotel and the hotel room my daughter and i were very impressed we had a lovely room and for being a hilton honors member we even received a free fruit basket and two bottles of water please beware however and always check your bank account for any additional charges we had used my daughters credit card to hold the room but asked for my visa debit card to be charged for the final amount we were both charged for the room and it took numerous phone calls to receive a credit we were also charged for several additional charges that we should not have been the billing department was extremely rude as we called them numerous times to get the matter straightened out as for the hotel i would highly recommend it and also for its wonderful location and shuttle i;4
the hotel was good the neighborhood was ok few places to eat but some of them close early subway station is near but with the power of uber you can go anywhere you want la traffic is horrible so take extra time the staffs at the lobby are nice brian who checked us in the first night 615 and recommended a good ramen place nicole who helped us change our room pil always greeted us and helped our check out well who ever was at the lobby greeted us thank you guys for making our stay memorable;4
got this hotel at a really good price and have to say in the most positive feedback positive good location everything in walking distance and right by subway for longer journeys rooms whilst small are clean and i have stayed in smaller ones in new york such as the edison house keeping stood out as friendly and doing a great job negative the hotel tax told it paid for use of gym business suite and faster wifi none of which i needed i was on holiday i did go into the business suite to print off boarding passes it was basically two computers with printers there was no toner and limited paper it felt a little like money grabbing for example it was 3 per bag to store them in the day of departure including a small handbag in conclusion positive stay with small;4
stayed here for 6 nights in late june with friends and family rooms were big and clean front desk was helpful and one lady name i cant remember now recommended one mexican restaurant which turned out to be very good hugo was always there to make us omelets at breakfast good ones all and all we enjoyed our stay and hollywood hotel is good value for the money only downside is that parking fee per night is a bit too high;4
the staff at hollywood hotel are very welcoming accommodating and knowledgeable about local attractions and public transportation our first evening they offered to schedule tours for us and provided detailed info about how to use public transportation to get around on our own if we preferred the complimentary breakfast downstairs was wonderful the chef made our omelets to order there were mini or large belgian waffles also made to order and a wide variety of other breakfast food available muffins cereal etc self serve orange juice hot coffee and hot tea bar in cute little dining area kept very clean every time we came through lobby i was greeted by name nice personal touch theres a little store towards back of hotel that sells post cards and convenience items;4
everything was good except foodfood quality was ok but not goodroom was clean and quietif you are just using it as sleeping place and eat at other place then this is the perfect place it is very close to lax;4
the hotel is based on eighth avenue and is close to penn station madison square garden time square etc like everything in new york it is all in a walking distance with restaurant row down the street and being on eighth avenue itself allows access to some great food options the room is a good size for new york it was clean and the amenities were well looked after;4
double check the rates and any aaa discounts that may apply hotel could use some updates and attention to rugs walls etc cant beat the location in the heart of lincoln center ive been staying here for years its probably time to update and freshen some things up;4
listen long story short the only problems i had was that the building was old so when we took our showers the pipes started to make loud noices as if the building was under attack there were mold on the ceiding of the bathroom i brought it to the attention of the staff they immediately apologized and discounted my room on top of my other discounted price my room was large enough the hotel was in a prefect location the subway was right around the concer and there is a lot of places to eat you would be a snob not to book this hotel however remember it is a old new york city building so dont come here with the attitude of stay at the ritz if you stay more than a hour in your hotel room complainig you should save your money and stay home;4
used to live in nyc and have been trying to find a decent comfortable hotel in a good location for multiple trips mariana mero a front of house manager at the empire who took care of me while i was there has helped me make a good choice for the future i will return the empire hotel reception staff were attentive exceedingly good natured and helpful even though when i arrived the hotel was sold out and heaving with a wedding party my first room was on a low a floor and lacked sufficient closet space and drawers for my 10 day stay i was moved the next day to a much better room on a higher floor with more daylight ok the 60s style dã©cor is out of date but the room was comfortable and clean as was the bathroom housekeeping was accommodating in providing additional;4
this is our home away from home for late arrivals at lax so convenient to walk over from the terminals sleep quality is always great this time around we were allocated a room that had questionable stains on the couch almost as though someone had sat down in the nude with some sort of jelly on their privates leaving strange shapes of stains could definitely use a steam or dry cleaning that said every other aspect of the stay was great and we thank the team for their consistent warm hospitality;4
great location near central park and away from hustle and bustle but within a subway rides distance to anything hotel staff was friendly and helpful had issues with air conditioning but other than that a great option near a wonderful area;4
this hotel is excellent value and has great character our captains cabin was comfortable although we had to get the heat turned off as the room was like an oven the first night the staff were helpful and friendly the cafe serves nice food and the bar is very popular with locals and had long queues to get in late at night expensive drink but a great atmosphere in the huge ballroom we took bikes all the way to central park and down to battry park no the bike tracks;4
great location beautiful period building next to the lincoln ctr our booking agent arranged a queen size room ordinarily this would have been great but with getting married in the city and the need to prepare at the hotel the room was a little small and dark the staff responded to our need by moving us to a bigger brighter room just perfect;4
great location for a renowned new york hotel that offers rooms some of which have a beautiful view extra charges for internet access are very expensive and mandatory itâs not the best hotel in new york but iâll always remember it forever;4
we scored a room at this wonderfullylocated hotel through hotwire and were expecting the worst when the very sweet receptionist told us the hotel was fully booked on saturday night room we were not surprised to find ourselves in a broom closetsized room shaped much like a triangle the room was so small i used the fridge inside the closet as a night stand to get inside the bathroom you had to step inside the shower we are not large people but we found much to laugh about but the real kicker was the fact that our queensized mattress had been placed atop a much smaller frame making sleeping along the edges precipitous the lobby of this hotel is pretty and interesting and almost impossible to see because someone kept the lighting at 1 candle power silly;4
iâve stayed at this hotel twice once in june 2016 second time in december 2018 two different seasons and of course different prices as well people expect way too much sometimes nyc is known for not being spacious at all still the rooms my friends and i got fitted us perfectly the hotel has a great location you can walk to time square and to the empire state building the hotel personnel so always so gracious and helped us with everything we requested if youâre looking for big spacious rooms youâre probably going to pay a lot of money in order to do so otherwise rooms were clean staff was courteous and location was great;4
we were very pleased with our choice of hotel for sight seeing in new york it was very close to central park the metropolitan opera house shopping on 5th avenue times sqare and the empire state building the hotel was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful;4
stayed at the new yorker in june travelling with a friend she stays at the new yorker periodically for work travel so we picked this at her recommendation i typically like smaller boutiquey hotels but this was a spurofthemoment getaway on a budget and we did get a comparatively great price the stay was a mixed bag of good and bad the good super convenient location nowhere better if youre coming for an event at msg surrounded by relatively cheap food options ticktock diner was an awesome easy choice security was excellent and staff friendly the bad arrived from jfk around 5pm and room was not yet available thats a bit annoying as its 2 hours after checkin time but not a big deal we went out for a bit and returned to get ready for dinner and room;4
this hotel is the perfect location if you are going to be doing shopping in new york maceys is just round the corner it was really busy when i was there but it was in early december and everyone seemed to be doing their christmas shopping i was advised that i had been upgraded but the only difference between my room and my colleagues was the i had a teacoffee maker the rooms are smallish but that is quite normal in new york city the staff there were very friendly and helpful;4
stayed here before a flight out the next day the hotel is chic modern with a spacious efficient feel the staff were friendly and very helpful with one exception i was dropped off with three suitcases no one came to the door to help me until i walked to the reception desk way across the cavernous lobby to ask for assistance meanwhile leaving some bags by the door no doorman very quiet though right next to the airport morning shuttles are frequent reliable;4
great hotel near to london landmarks friendly staff would definitely recommend great buffet breakfast and evening meal with lots of choice to suit everyone in our group of 11 issue with one of the rooms resolved quite quickly staff are friendly and helpful;4
it is a good hotel close to everything the attention was very nice especially from julian the only detail was an annoying noise in the wall of the bathroom which was annoying to sleep everything else was very good;4
my friends and i stayed here this weekend and the hotel was very clean safe and quiet it is a 67 uber ride to hollywood blvd great location the rooms all had patios and ours faced a courtyard that was nicely decorated the staff were all very nice and helpful as well;4
have been to nyc several time but this was the first time at this hotel the hotel is huge the staff are friendly and the rooms are a decent size for new york the hotel is close to the garden so if youre going to a concert or game this location is perfect there are a ton of homeless people around the hotel though so be prepared to be hassled going in and out of the hotel still a good hotel though;4
the staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel lobby is distinctive and attractive everything was very clean the bathroom is tiny but well appointed and the king bed was comfortable we were facing lincoln center where thereâs a lot of foot traffic but not vehicles so the noise factor was old for new york lots of restaurants central park and of course lincoln center in walking distance;4
good location if you like universal studio fun on the way from lax but is behind hollywood hill sign starline tours pick u up from hotel rooms good restaurant good shopping only at universal studio shopping centre not near;4
this hotel is perfectly located close to msg and penn station itâ´s a perfect stay for a weekend trip in nyc for us it was nice to stay at a hotel close to penn station since we landed and flew from newark liberty international airport there are trains going between the airport and penn station so you donâ´t have to take a taxi if you stay at this hotel however the standard at the hotel is mediocre the service is good but the rooms are just ok not more than that;4
the place certainly has its own flavor it is something like it fall off time where you feel you are in a movie setup about morocco the staff are nice and the place was so clean and well organized shared bath ok no problem you will not feel it is negative issue just use it late or too early and you are ok the jane is one of the best motels n town but it is some times over prices given that most rooms has no bathrooms i still like it for those on low budget it is the best option in ny compared to others jad;4
short and sweet review i thought this hotel was very very good upon entering for first glance expectations decor was lovely staff were really helpful and was very professional for me it was a great location very close to central park not too far away from times square either room was lovely but really really small a lot smaller than i had anticipated which wasnât ideal as we had two cases of luggage i love a hotel shower and this hotel shower was amazing but yet again the bathroom was tiny i would definately stay again infact when i return in 2020 i will be staying here again;4
a very pleasant staying in new york due to the excellent position of ameritania close to central park and all the main city attractions many thanks to the hotel guys julian and jalal for their help and kindness;4
generally speaking i found the hotel to be a very nice facility there was however an issue with my room which being brought tot he attention of the maintenance staff was not sufficiently resolved the room maintained an average temperature of around 80 degrees even with the noisy air conditioning unit running and producing cold air the excessive noise resulted in needing to raise tv volume and difficulty talking on the phone otherwise i found the hotel to be a nice facility hopefully this was an isolated experience and the impact was limited to my room;4
the hotel itself was nicerecent undergone a remodel and the room was nicely redone the lobby was lovely staff were consistently kind food was pretty good in the bar and dining room location cant be beat pool was fun and the shuttle service was super convenient my only complaint was the super weak water pressure and the lack of really hot water;4
we booked our room at the ramada because we got a really good rate of 6750 a night though the hotel website this was a promotional rate when you stayed 3 or more nights we received a off we were in a queen bedroom my only complaint was that the room was really small im sure the king and two bed rooms are larger but we didnt see them but for the price i really didnt care about the size of our room because it still had everything you need even a small fridge and a microwave the hotel is nice and clean but you can tell it is a little older we had a small balcony and could even see the hollywood sign from our window there isnt much in walking distance if you have a car the location is convenient to all the attractions the hotel includes a free;4
this hotel is in a fab location for our stay we first had a king room on the 12th floor their highest i found the bed way too soft old mattresses with toppers i suspect so on our 2nd of five nights they moved us to another king room on the 10th floor this was done with no fuss at all and greatly appreciated the rooms have been renovated but maybe a number of years ago they were clean iâm the type to check under beds and the king room was very spacious for central ny every afternoon in the lobby free muffins fruit biscuits croissants soft drinks are offered which was a nice surprise my only complaint would be that all the hotel doors seem to slam i had to ask our neighbours to please close theirs gently there is a bit of street noise but this is central;4
spacious room cleanand comfortable awesome amenities included wifi a bit slow coffee fridge iron board short on clothes hangers and drawer space breakfast the best seen in a long time and always served with a smile kudos also to michael and brian at the reception desk for their willingness to go that extra mile to assist outside balconies on floor permitted taking cool videos under palm trees misled by internet information google maps and other that distance from hh to mondrian hotel was 26km when in fact it was actually 56 miles 10 minute walk plus a 40 minute bus ride and yes la has a sad homelessness issue but was never approached by any seems they keep to themselves in all enjoyed stay at hh thank you staff;4
stayed at the new yorker with the family for one week hotel was well located rooms were clean and any issues were promptly sorted by reception agree the bathrooms are a dated and rooms on the small side but overall very happy;4
we stayed in the ameritania hotel for four nights in december 2017 great location our room was on the second floor towards the back of the hotel so there was no street noise the room was very quiet clean and well appointed all the hotel staff were friendly and helpful we did not have breakfast in the hotel instead we went to cascade cafe for breakfast few minutes walk from the hotel on the corner of w 54th st8th ave great food i would have no hesitation in booking this hotel for future trips to new york city;4
quick pickup at the airport and good service at the hotel the cafe food at the hotel above expectations good service and fresh food the exercise room on top of the hotel was a nice waterhole when having a jetlag;4
the empire hotel has a great location and friendly staff pasquale at the front desk was particularly friendly and remembered me from when i was a guest a month earlier i strongly recommend requesting a room with a full bath meaning bathtub bathrooms with just a shower are really small and it is difficult to keep the floor from getting wet because there is no shower curtain or door;4
we had no car and did not want to drive very close to main a subway line safe to walk around at all times if you like breakfast it is from 630am 1030am and omelettes are cooked for you please tip hugo he worked every day i was there our room was noisy room 133 right by front desk and entrance stay on upper floors staff very average michael at front desk was the one exception he was very helpful maid service is very poor basically make bed and replace towels not much cleaning done not that nice of a place overall but for us it was all about location location location especially if you are relying on metro and doing most activities in the hollywood area;4
ive stayed here many times love this hotel just be careful not to stay in the rooms next to the elevator shaft and try to get the ones overlooking the little square with the statue quieter housekeeping always pleasant and helpful i always feel safe the ac could do with an upgrade its noisy;4
spent a quick fun filled 26hrs in nyc with my oldest and dearest girlfriend we were able to check in early maggi checked us in she was professional and super friendly wished us a happy birthdaythey read the comment section we had little treats waiting for us in our room all the staff we met were professional and courteous very quick checkout able to store our bags so we could site see hotel was clean and neat our room needed a little tlc but very minor stuff hotel has a very retrocool design great location too;4
very comfy large rooms and giant bathrooms stayed for one night for universal halloween horror for the fourth time and will come back again transferred from anaheim by train ok and metro less so as travelling with suitcases the hotel is in walking distance of the metro but up a giant hill so not at all recommended if you have suitcases scales in the business centre in the foyer very helpful for distributing weight when flying and buying staff are helpful and i used the digital keycard quite successfully;4
we stayed here in the middle of august and chose the hotel because of its proximity to universal studios we could not fault the location we managed to get to universal studios at 9am on the first day and went on all the popular rides without queuing we went back to the hotel early afternoon and went back again at 4 with two young boys this worked well the park is an easy walk from the hotel over a bridge or pedestrian walkway there is no need take a bus universal city is walkable too with lots of restaurants wolfgang puck was my favourite the hotel itself is nicely presented the pool not as big as the pictures suggest was great it was never busy and there were lots of sunbeds and towels the staff at the pool were friendly and attentive but not overbearing;4
on check in we were given an upgrade to a room with a view which was brilliant the hotel is in a fantastic location right opposite penn station madison square gardens three blocks from the empire state building and eight blocks from times square the hotel is older having been built in the 1930âs so t has some character to it bathroom is dated but was clean and the shower had fantastic pressure room was a good size and kept very clean had a great stay;4
our stay was pleasant friendly hotel staff who made us welcome room was spacious and clean could suggest cork screw wine glass to complement the ice fridge would be nice lifts were slow but under repair breakfast was amazing good variety and fresh bad experience with karmel transport which concierge arranged for us to airport i would also suggest hotel seriously considers what transport they recommend after driver threatened to drop us on the side of freeway after credit card apparently declined;4
the staff is friendly and responded quickly to requests like when a loud party was going on down the hall or when there was a dripping faucet the management needs to spend more time fixing the details like broken light fixtures dings in the walls stained carpets and worn stairs the elevators that were working should be in an elevator museum we often had to take the stairs after waiting a long time without an elevator showing up the breakfast buffet is extensive and is good for brunch the omelette chef went through the motions but wasnt helpful or friendly this is southern california and they dont have avocados for two or more people the best option to the burbank airport is a taxi 25 with tip;4
we had to stay in manhattan for 3 days and this was a great place right next to the central park close to a subway and delisstores and restaurants close byvery friendly peolpe at desk and always clean room the room was very small but enough just to sleep and to take daily showers the aircondition was a little bit a pain in the neck because it was really loud and didnt really cool down but for everything else it was a bargain;4
this hotel is about 1 block from madison square garden and about 4 blocks down and two blocks over to times square i am a wyndham rewards member so i was upgraded to a room that was updated its a typical nyc hotel room with a small bathroom dont plan on having much room to store anything and a desk chair small closet and king size bed my colleague had access to the free breakfast on the 39th floor but after checking it out we went to the tick tock diner in the main lobby instead if you are worried about safety there are security guards that make sure you have your key out each time you go to the elevators so no one can just walk off the street and head up to a floor i gave it 4 stars because the lobby area is a bit small and outdated so when you walk in you are;4
the hotel is well located just steps away from penn station and a few blocks from time square friendly staff and clean rooms thats all i need when it comes to a place i want to stay also just 5 blocks away from the edge;4
good value for a west side manhattan hotel stayed in the bunk bed room small but when we spent all day out and about its worth it baths are nice hotel is also a 2 minute walk from a parking garage;4
during my visit to nyc my reservation was incorrect and i was over charged neida corrected my reservation before my arrival and informed her manager micheal of the charge error micheal immediately refunded the money thanks i really appreciated the a service they really redeemed my relationship with wyndham;4
this place had changed names from when i booked it and used to be the universal hotel probably a good thing as we didnt think it was that close to universal maybe it is if you have a car however it is very close to the metro that will get you there in about 10 minutes the hotel itself was very nice with good rooms and free wifi it may just have been us being paranoid but we found the area after dark to be a bit scary however we felt that way about most of la i wouldnt recommend the bus tour that they can send you on it didnt stop enough for our liking and perhaps if we hadnt have been so lazy wed have tried to find another one the pool is private and looked nice but we never used it as there were too many sites we wanted to see the metro system is awsome although;4
if you are looking for a centrally located place to stay in manhattan this is it penn mta amtrak station is just couple of blocks away beside being in the midst of varieties of eateries time square is within 20 minutes walking distance the central park a bit more a cozy little place and appeared very safe very comfortable bed and neat clean bathroom with fresh towels hotel staffs were very friendly and courteous besides being helpful reasonably priced considering its location room tariff varies between weekend and week days the hotel has no elevator as such elderly people should think twice before making their decision being on the 8th avenue remain prepared to accept vehicle noise as perpetual companion we had a wonderful stay ð;4
just returned from 5 nights in the new yorker the hotel is very central and opposite the empire state the rooms r very comfy we were on the 19th floor and my god i would feel so sorry for ones on lower levels the noise is wild cars beeping and sirens etc all day and night long the windows r not sound proof but i suppose that canât be helped we also met some of the strangest people we have every met overall the staff r very friendly and welcoming and rooms r spotless and comfy and opposite macyâs shopping mall mcdonaldâs and starbucks;4
i have been stayng at this hotel for the last several years when i travel to los angeles the property seems to be improved every time i visit this year i was given a refurbished room facing the courtyard the rooms had tile floors with rugs a microwave and refrigerator as well as a seperate large room for a closet and storage the bed is very comfortable and the rooms was spotless the wifi worked well they have a super pool however it is unheated so it is really not usable except during the summer they continue to provide a really nice breakfast served in a large well decorated room it is a nice change from the usual free hotel breakfast chaosthey do charge 18 a day for secured parking which is the norm for the area i find the area very walkable and there are a;4
we had 2 nights in this hostel double room it is clean and it looks quite good it is the perfect place to stay just for weekend but for young people as the walls are quite thin you can hear the noises from another rooms the localization is perfect there are many busses that starts here or you can choose the hammersmith metro line;4
this hotel is a bit pricey but not considering the location the rooms are clean beds on the overfirm side but not too bad and the location is great across the street from lincoln center an easy walk to central park and on the subway just a couple of stops from the theaters i stay here whenever i spend the night in town they store your bag for free even after checkout which is great for a matinee or shopping the doorman is always there to get you a cab if you want one the on site dining is nice especially breakfast and room service is efficient;4
we stayed here for three nights had a good stay clean rooms average sized no issues with the mini bar we didnt use it friendly and helpful staff jeff was kind the concierge at check out the same over priced parking as it is all over manhattan but free if you leave it for at least 24h same block with studio 54 just around the corner downtown on 8th you can have a good breakfast at pickabagel and awesome coffee at ground central;4
we stayed here for the marathon weekend and we were pleasantly surprised i read the reviews on dirty cockroaches etc but i didnt see any of it we were on the 10th floor which might be the reason for us not seeing any bugs i did the room check and inspected very well i looked all over and didnt see anything is it a dated hotel yes but our rooms were clean and we had no issues with any sort of dirtiness etc we actually received champagne and strawberries not sure why but it was a nice surprise check in easy they tell you to come back at 3 and the room will be ready dead on lobby very chic we enjoyed a drink there but very expensive but then again you are in ny room tiny but it worked it was clean and they upgraded us to the 10th;4
yes itâs dated butits very clean and comfortable as well as affordable also safe they have security posted 24x7 in the lobby and donât let anyone enter that does not present a room key i picked this hotel because of its proximity to penn station had an early morning amtrak train location was perfect and our room had 2 bathroomsthat was great excellent value if you donât care about modern updates and just want a convenient safe clean comfortable and affordable hotel in manhattanthis is it staff were helpful as well;4
after reading the reviews i was slightly dubious glad we stuck with it yes some rooms are slightly outdated bust you can upgrade to recently renovated ones yes room was slightly small but we were never in the room other to sleep and change fab location very clean staff friendly and a brill location new york was amazing;4
great location for the lincoln centre and short walk before you hit central park hotel staff front of house as well as house keeping and staff at the entrance point of arrival were all great really was service with a smile loved the bar on the ground floor created a good ambience for drinks following a day of viewing the city and then you have the roof top bar with such an amazing view really a gem breakfast rather pricey when there are so many other places to grab a good breakfast on your doorstep not great view from bedroom window all windows appear to look in on each other the wardrobe area and where the safe was located was too dark needed another light however room and bathroom clean with a very comfy bed would have been even better if the;4
stayed here about 15 years ago with our daughter and came back because we liked it before it is still a great hotel in an excellent location free shuttle service to universal city walk but you can also easily walk there tons of food shopping and entertainment options at city walk without any admission charge entrance to universal city is easily accesable hotel is beautiful with lots of glass and well landscaped grounds be prepared to pay top dollar for services within the hotel itself had martinis at the hotel bar during happy hour that were 12 each but the free hors de vors were outstanding went back down to the bar for 2 vodka tonics to take back to our room and the bill was 43 to clarifythey were doubles and that included the tip but stilla bit of;4
really nice hotel good rooms which are a decent size if you dont go for the cheapest the bar is good but a little bit zebra and gold for me but friendly staff and nice atmosphere great location right next to central park on columbus circle ideal location to see nyc from nice room bar and pool in summer;4
we had a great experience here iï¸ booked a 2 double room through groupon at an incredible rate the room was dated and we didnât have a view but i knew that going in and the location was great we had plenty of room for the 4 of us with 2 bathrooms and 2 closets the beds were small but comfortable this was the most affordable way to stay near midtowntimes square;4
we stayed there for 5 nights loved this hotel when we checked in straight away we got a upgrade to room with a view the cleaners were in the room every day hotel was a great location we also got a late check out we will book into this hotel when we come back to new york;4
the staff were incredibly friendly in particular the front desk staff they made me feel at home straight away the rooms were nothing fancy but good value location is great very close to metro station supermarket tourist spots like hollywood forever cemetery etc as a solo traveller i was really grateful for the microwave in the room as i didnt fancy going out by myself much in the evenings the free breakfast is nice if a little basic and the chefs serving up waffles and omelettes were very friendly the noise outside did wake me once or twice but its not unbearable no room service or mini bar if thats your kind of thing though there is a fridge id stay here again;4
a place ive been going to for years location is excellent rooms king are big and comfy only trouble is noice of air con and outside noises better isolation would be a must bell men are really nice and helpful guys breakast is average but handy coffee for free;4
hotel was nice room was clean front desk professional it is very close to the airport but very soundproof i did not hear a single plane arrival by car was a pain the portico dropoff area was closed off with cones for valet parking the other entrance was shuttle only with no stopping signs so there is no place to pull up and check in like at most hotels recommend just parking straight in the parking deck on arrival way cheaper than valet even if making several inouts;4
a good hotel near to penn station and subway which makes getting around very convenient staff were very friendly and helpful at check in and throughout my stay good internet access in the room and a comfy bed gave me what i needed for work and rest one negative was the shower temperature which was difficult to control;4

the hotel the stuff and the rooms are great also the pool deck is one of kind and a must see there i have the feeling that the value is great when you book via an online portal but in the room it said that it costs normally 759 night which is too much;4
great location friendly staff and stylish ny roof top bar my daughter loved the fact it was the gossip girls hotel rooms are small but this is new york and space costs money only negative was the charge to use the in room coffee machine maybe provide a couple free and charge for extras;4
i stayed at the eh for four nights mid nov 20011 the beds were very comfortable it was clean and tidy i quite liked the decor very designer possibly a little over done the bathroom was tiny and had no bath for the price i would have expected one of those lavish american bathrooms my friend and i had a room service breakfast one morning it was mediocre and cost about 60 i guess im used to english hotels where you would get breakfast included i found the room very over heated had to get a maintenance man to sort the air con i found the reception staff very friendly and helpful they recommended some fantastic restaurants which we would never have found we came back one day to find that our room keys didnt work eventually the whole door handle was drilled out as;4

service we were lucky and got victor during our checkin and our checkout he was very helpful and went out of his way to help us kudos to victor unfortunately this was not true for the others at the front desk one girl in particular was having an animated conversation on the phone and barely looked up to ask what we wanted facilities they were actually quite good for the price we paid the room was clean and there were housekeeping services everyday if desired the bathrooms though few in number were very clean however the greatest shortcoming in this place was the lack of a kettle or even a pot to boil water true there was a pantry but there were no pots and pans nor cutlery in sight if they are so worried about things being stolen i suggest that they make the;4
i recently stayed at the jane for well forever i had booked 18 nights with them for my stay in nyc and heres some of what i thought pros absolutely loved the location in the meatpacking district within walking distance to everywhere in the village this was great for dining so many options and it felt very safe walking around all of these areas when youve managed to secure a room away from the 2nd floor nightclub away from the westside highway and away from the 6th floor roof terrace youll be getting a really good nights sleep i was initially on the 6th floor and slept like a baby eventhough people are walking up and down the corridor using the bathroom facilities i never heard a thing during the nights and loved the rest i was getting all of the;4
our room the most basic one offered at this hotel was very clean and goodsized for a hotel in nyc weve stayed here before and got a much smaller room but this one has an alcove with a desk in it and does not feel cramped at all convenient to broadway the parking garage is on 34th street which gets closed at rush hour so we had to go elsewhere for parking there are plenty of other places nearby the tic toc diner next door was great for breakfast;4
this a very nice hotel it has old charm our plan came with free breakfast and internet the breakfast was more than we expected made to order omelettes made for a hearty breakfast they have a nice bar but it must have been the off season because it did not open when we were there in feb the room was not large but big enough for two people i believe the parking was not free but since we did not have a car i am not 100 sure the metro station was about 2 blocks away easy excess to hollywood and universal studio;4

the hotel is fine with a good location and our room was comfortable but it is the staff that makes this a really good hotel thank you to receptionist carol for your kindness and professionalism your help during a difficult situation was kind thoughtful and much appreciated the management need to really value and hang onto such staff as carol and i did take the time to tell them that;4
the hotel is awesome the location is very convenient the front desk staff very helpful and the lobby is very nice traditional new york the junior suite is very very spacious overlooking broadway and the beds are very comfortable and the pool lounge is nice with magnificent views of ny the only major complain was that they use plastic cups on the pool deck which looks very cheap the kallini family;4
its a really nice hotel for the money it was clean comfortable and well decorated a great option for anyone on a low budget my room was small but comfortable i think it may have been a single as it would be very cosy for two people the bathroom again very small but the shower was very powerful it did go hot and cold at times though hotel is located in upper west side near to the top of central park its too far to walk to all of the main attractions but has two subway stations within a few minutes walk the subway is cheap and easy to use costs around 1215 in a taxi a couple of things could be improved 1 the hotel is a little noisy i had a water pipe running through my bathroom everytime someone put the water on above my room it was very loud strange;4
we needed to be at boulud sud across the street for a party so the hotel location was absolutely perfect two weeks prior we stayed at the muse near broadway and could not drive down the street and were delayed an extra 30 minutes in traffic this location put us walking distance to columbus circle and we even walked the 15 miles to the theater on 42 leaving 42nd after theater is impossible to get a taxi so it was good to be close enough to walk but far enough away from the craziness of times square the staff was friendly after a 5 hour harrowing drive there was a valet to greet us he wanted to warn me that the charge for valet was 70 which we did because we were tired and late and he said the garage was six blocks away my mother had a room that was small and;4
location is ideal if you are visiting universal studios room was very clean bathroom was beautiful and upgraded king bed with a pullout couch for the kids turned on the heater and asked for 2 blankets to be brought up for the kids which they brought up within 10 min service was very good as we left they offered us 4 waters for our drive home very much appreciated;4
excellent location for visiting fordham and broadway tkts office around the cornerand upper west side this is my second excellent stay be warned that bathroom is extremely small but is adequate nice shower here for visit with my college student at fordhamwill stay here again;4
our family stayed at this hotel for six nights we all enjoyed the daily breakfast and found it plentiful true there was no fresh fruit but it does come with the room and it saved us serious money the room was very comfortable and the outdoor noise was no problem with the exception of the nightclub night which is pretty loud we were tired so we still fell asleep i do agree that the neighborhood is not one to go looking for trouble in but we walked to the subway daily and had no problems there is also a riteaid less than a block away which was quite convenient overall i found this hotel much better than the reviews posted here i stay stayed in other lowrated hotels that were so much worse the staff was always helpful to us the room was always clean the pool;4
we stayed couple nights in a hollywood hotel we enjoyed complimentary breakfast and convienent location of the hotel staff was helpful and friendly especially angelica who helped us to check in overall we had very nice and relaxing stay;4

i stayed at the empire for two nights last weekend my room which was on the fourth floor was clean quiet and overall very nice the bed was the most comfortable ive slept in for ages the staff i encountered were helpful an courteous though checkin was slow the lobby is rather dark and cold so if you want a place to read or relax youre probably better off trying the starbucks next door the location was perfect i am a woman and was traveling at home and i felt perfectly comfortable walking back from the theater at 10 at night i would definitely return although im not staying there on my next trip because the rates are way higher than what i paid for this stay;4
we booked this hotel because it really is the closest to universal studios and a quick uphill not too bad walk to the front gates however the staff at this place was top notch and upon seeing that we were celebrating an anniversary upgraded us to a suite for free we had free breakfast the next morning which was yummy and tried the seafood buffet at night i swear to youthis mustve been the best buffet ive ever had my so and i tried to stop eating but we couldnt the choices oh the choices the pool is a bit small but thats okay this hotel is really about universal studios i have to say the staff really made this trip for us even remembering us when we passed by the front desk again our room was big beds were comfortable and the tv was a flat screen our;4
the new yorker was the perfect hotel and location the room was cozy and the view was great everything was in walking distance too the hotel restaurant trattoria bianca was excellent and service was good i would definitely come back;4
fabulous location although rooms themselves quite run down clean secure quiet positives outweigh no view from back side room teacoffee making in room would have been great also perhaps washing line in bathroom there was always staff available and they always acknowledged us;4
we stayed here for a long weekend and thought the hotel was lovely although the rooms were very small the swimming pool is nowhere near as big as it looks on the website its more of a plunge pool which was a bit disappointing as that was one of the plus sides for picking the hotel but saying that the roof terrace and bar was a great place to chill out late afternoon early evening after having done the sightseeingshopping all day theres also a nightclub which was very popular all through the week and weekend location was good for getting around though as its just a few minutes to walk to central park or the nearest metro stop;4
we have frequent guests of the empire hotel both because of its location next to lincoln center and its pet friendly policy itâs an older building so our expectations from our assigned are always thought of in that context but this was the first time we took note of the quality of the furnishings while the bed is wonderfully comfortable the couch in our junior suite must be close to 25 years old itâs tired and saggy and truly in deplorable condition one reason for getting a suite in the first place is to have some seating options other than the bed this couch shouldâve been replaced years ago having said that this is still one of our favorite uws hotels;4
i enjoyed most aspects of this stay the staff was excellent the room was clean and the hotel is in an excellent location we were a leisurely 15 minute walk from times square and our broadway show msg is across the street and there is subway access north and south without crossing the street i didnt appreciate how pushy the wyndham desk rep was when i mistakenly thought he was the concierge he tried to psuh tour tickets and a dinner package on me repeatedly even after i told him i was looking for the concierge also there is a kiosk with cheap breakfast options tooked in a corner behind the concierge that i didnt notice until after we checked out but there is a mcdonalds across the street some great bagel shops nearby a dunkin donuts around the corner and the;4
i had read many many negative reviews of this hotel on various sites and was very nervous about what lay ahead for us we arrived late on march 12th and miriam greeted us quickly and courteously she was amazed that i had drove for 9 hours to get there and so upgraded us to double queen room even though our room was one of those above the hvac equipment outside we had our ac running in the room and couldnt hear anything outside yes there was no view but then we were only in the room to sleep so it didnt matter to us the room was very clean and quiet at the end of the hall we loved it the shower is odd but that would be our only negative the entire staff were friendly and helpful the food in the restaurant was good we would definitely go back also the;4
as this was my first trip over to the us i was expecting to be wowed by a great hotel with fantastic service i wasnt quite wowed but we had a good stay we were showed to our first room and quickly asked to change i dont want to see a wall as a view the 2nd room was had a lovely boutique feel if a little small the view was much better as we were looking out onto broadway there was also an error with our booking and we had to prove that we had breakfast which turned out to be a good call as the breakfast set us up for each day we were there the only problem is that the american breakfast ran out on two days we went the dining room which limited our choice when i asked if there was going to be more hot food cooked we were well within the time to dine the man;4
it was everything i needed the room is small but very nice but i was there only to sleep so it worked fine shared bathrooms was no problem only had to wait once for the shower i would stay again for sure;4
a classic hotel stayed for four nights its not stateoftheart but it was in 1930 the rooms are clean and simple housekeeping thorough and helpful breakfast included is served at the tic toc next to the lobby but is not recommend service there not good nothing to complain about from the hotel staff though and ultimate location when watching a showmatch in madison square garden or commuting from penn station very cool to have stayed at the new yorker;4
larger room more comfortable for couples location excellent for lincoln centre within walking distance of major museums and other cultural attractions try to get an upgrade well worth the effort;4
i checked in days inn hotel with my husband on 022416 and we were given a standard king size room that smelled like mold and mildew i immediately left the room with my husband and explained to the front desk that i have allergies to mold and they immediately moved my husband and i to another room on the 13th floor which was much better i was very satisfied as well as my husband as to how professional courteous and attentive to my needs the front desk was during our stay in new york the room was just right for a couple vacationing for a few days while exploring the wonderful city of new york and all the city has to offer this hotel is not luxurious but simple and the location is very accessible and convenient to subway that will just about take you anywhere around new;4
if you plan on visiting nearby places in nyc such as lincoln center central park etc this is the most convenient location pleasant staff however dont plan on spending much time in your room while there the rooms are very tiny with no space to move and the temperature control in the room is questionable while the lobby is very nice and inviting too crowded to enjoy;4
the room was otherwise fine but somewhere noisythin walls i guess in particularly the siund of running water in the morning;4
i really liked the look of the hotel and also really liked the location my only downside is the noise factor we were on the 9th avenue side and every morning the service trucks pulled up at 330 and for the next few hours there was the noise of trash trucks and delivery trucks every morning the next time the hotel goes through a refurbish they would do well to factor in some noise remediation design the bathrooms while lovely looking can be considered quite small;4
pon arrival we had to wait a few minutes as it was busy in reception but that was fine when we did check in we were told that we had been given an upgrade to our room and was given a room with a view we were also given 2 vouchers for a free breakfast at the diner attached the tick tock dinerthis was because it was my birthday the day before we arrived the room itself was lovely and cosy not verly big but hey we werent there to stay in the room all day we were there to visit new york the bathroom again was small but not really an issue we did find a few hairs on the wall in the bathroom under the window but this is a minor fault and not necessarily the housekeepers problem as they could have been in the air after cleaning and just so happened to land on the wall there;4
we stayed here for 3 nights in october 2014 its a very nice property which youd excpect in this part of la the room was very spacious and comfortable and had a great view of universal studios which was about a 10 minute walk away or you could take the free shuttle bus the breakfast buffet was very good it wasnt cheap but will do the job the staff were excellent and always seemed genuine when providing help one evening there was a entertainer playing the piano and singing in the bar which was a nice touch location wise its not far from universal studios and also about 10 minute from the hollywood walk of fame its a long 30 minute drive depending on traffic to santa monica beach so plan your days wisely we definitely would stay here again the room was;4
after reading the reviews i was scared of coming here howevermy room smoking eleventh floor although small was clean and comfortable i had a good kingsize bed and the bathroom was clean and functionalthe elevator was slow and clunkybut it got me to my floorthe subway was only across the streetthe service at the front desk was affable enoughi got this hotel on hotwire and i would certaily give this hotel another try;4
we found the new yorker served its purpose the rooms are small but they are clean which is the main thing the hotel is a bit dated and could do with a spruce up you must try the diner attached the breakfasts are great;4
we stayed at the astor on the park in new york for nearly a week in february 2014 the room was very clean and well kept bed sheets changed every day as needed soaps shampoo and towels has a flat screen tv with cable it is not luxury but if your goal is to enjoy new york for a very moderate price than astor is a good place our room had a great view of central park which you may get if you ask area is safe and has plenty of small grocery and eating places great deli next door for breakfast with a turkish flavourconvenient bus lines are near by elevator is small and a bit slow but that is a minor item to us we appreciated also the friendlly and helpful attitude;4
heat ran the entire time we were there even after it was supposedly fixed the bar in the closet and hook on the bathroom door are impossible to reach unless you are 7 feet tall location for patrons of lincoln center is great several good restaurants nearby;4
we stayed at the empire hotel for our easter weekend in new york it was not our first choice but thats quite another story we were able to snag the reservation a week before we left so we considered ourselves lucky since we had tickets for the metropolitan opera we could literally exit the front door of the hotel and be in our seats in 10 minutes it is very convenient to the subway and uptowndowntown buses and the hotel has a great little restaurant right next door eds chowder house nevertheless the rooms are small and the bathrooms are the size of a postage stampi do think the rooms are rather expensive and a 1295 per day charge for wifi in the rooms excessive however you can use it for free in the lobby i bet they wouldnt like a bunch of people in;4
spent a great 5 days here on our first visit to new york the room was big enough for us as we only went there to sleep too busy doing the sights easy access to the metro system which is great for getting around get a metro card and load it with dollars for a discount we had a room right at the front which had some traffic noise but what do you expect in a city that never sleeps it was very clean and well decorated the staff on the front desk were amazing couldnt do enough for you very cheerful the room steward did a lovely job of cleaning the room making the bed fresh towels every day and kept the supply of shower gel coming the only free wifi was in the lobby but that was sufficient for us pick up your emails twice a day on the way out and on the;4
this hotel is a legend we stayed in the recently remodeled room on 8th floor at 157 in this neighborhood it was very good though the room a bit small a very comfortable bed and stylish art decco style furnishings dont miss the historical exhibit downstairs;4

friendly welcome by front office staff when i arrived early luggage stored at no charge while i went out for the day the room was spacious and comfortable hotel is located conveniently close to the south entrance of the 96th subways stop on broadway a problem with lukewarm water temperature was solved promptly i booked with an agency as it appeared that the lowest room price price guarantee to meet on line offerings was too complicated when i phoned in to check;4
there were two things that kept this from being a near perfect stay the bed was hard as a rock and the robes are only large enough for a large child the service was excellent and i loved the location really a fantastic hotel but they have to spend some money on new comfy mattress and some adult size robes;4
what a fabulous location this hotel is located within easy access to all the main highlights in new york we were greeted by linda on the desk who was extremely pleasant and efficient and she very kindly upgraded our room for us the room was a good size with a very well presented bathroom the bar and restaurant is first class whilst other public areas of the hotel could be described as a little tired this will not spoil your stay at the wyndham new yorker hotel i did find it a little quirky that i had to ask the concierge for the key to the public bathroom located in the basement overall i would highly recommend a stay in this hotel;4
i went to ca on business for a day i picked this hotel because i like the hilton chain and the rooms are usually nice it is also centrally located the check in process was not great i had a semi rude sourfaced agent he seemed put off by having to check me in my room was nice with a view of universal studios the bed was comfortable when i went to take a shower i noticed there was still soap and shampoo from the last guest so i question the cleanliness of the room overall and some of the elevators arent working so be prepared for a long wait to get up or down on a positive note the woman who checked me out of the hotel was friendly and helpful valet service was prompt and friendly also;4
fantastic location less than a block to madison square garden and penn station easy walking distance to macys empire state building and times square rooms are small but clean staff takes great pride in making all guests feel welcome everyone we encountered was pleasant and nice tick tock diner is adequate only ate there once food was good but average hotel is an older property with some updates highly recommended and we would stay there again;4
we arrived at newark and were taken to the hotel by shuttle bus â at about 4pm â the journey took over an hour god knows what a cab wouldâve charged the hotel is easily located in midtown 34th and 8th less than 5 mins walk from madison square garden less than 5 mins walk from penn station approx 1015 min walk to 42nd st and broadway approx 15 mins from times square therefore with rail links it is ideally located the lobby is very grand and it felt great walking through the revolving doors into the air conditioned lobby from the heat and noise outside staff at reception and the concierge desk were very friendly and helpful security was good too nobody has access to the lift area and floors above without presenting a key to a security guard there are plenty of lifts;4
if you want chain hotel dont come here the empire is in a great location on a great train line for all of the big manhattan sights and it is within walking distance of the park and the natural history museum one issue with this hotel is that it is old school the room was very cool as in cold but the ac was dated the windows opened so you can hear street noise i arrived late and was on the 2nd floor so i heard all of the street noise the next morning i had to go to work and asked for a change of rooms when i arrived back at the hotel at 6 they had moved everything to a higher floor that was a nice touch and they were respectful of my belongings my family joined me that night and it was a great time the lobby is old school and a place to really hang;4
hollywood hotel was adequate for the time my friend and i stayed it was clean and there is free breakfast make sure you get an omelette elias was very helpful at the reception desk the only downside would be that its not close to the main attractions of los angeles;4
astor on the park was a great location only 15 minutes on the subway to central nyc staff were very helpful and friendly basic rooms with everything a traveller needs all round great for a short stay in new york definatly recommend;4
i suffered finding a cheap hotel in nyc but i trusted this wab page and all i read was right rooms are really small for 2 but the neighborhood is nice cute and full of young people its in the middle of a remodelation but its paid back wth the pemanentwellcoming attitude of the hotel crew youre given clean towells each slippers soap shampoo and conditioner bath is always clean i have to underline it i would repeat it try it you wont regret it;4
comfortable quiet great location hotel is a little âtired â and could use some maintenance like closet doors or cracks on the shower walls bed linens are fresh and clean but the towels are getting to the point of unpleasant overall itâs a good hotel for the price great location across from lincoln center starbucks next door many restaurants to choose from in just one minute walk citi bank bank of america just across the street comfortable lobby bar and sitting area roof top lounge;4
it continues to amaze me that the new yorker an aging hotel of days gone by of nikola tesla fame is still doing well in the city that doesnt sleep with so many other options for quality hotels well i can tell you that my recent stay was a very good one not being in the area for 2 plus years for a trade show the location to many key sites is key only thing that was missed was complimentary water in the past at checkin i would have given it 5 stars but the little things still mean the most;4
we stayed at the hollywood hotel for 4 nights after finding a great deal through bookitcom although the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was a little bit sketchy the location itself was very convenient to hollywood attractions a metro station on the red line is just one block south of the hotel and this line takes you out to universal studios and the other attractions on hollywood blvd we paid 18 per night to park in a gated lot otherwise we would have had to park on the street which seemed a little risky the room was small but adequate with a patio overlooking a fountain and courtyard the hotel had several amenities including a pool no hot tub sauna room and exercise room a continental breakfast was provided with decent food selection the;4
my sister in from san diego and myself from rhode island stayed in this small gem for two nights the room was clean had two double beds with good linens a small but modern clean bathroom with room for stuff two large windows overlooking a courtyard trees and cats air conditioner that worked very well amoire decent tv hair dryer ironing board ice bucket extra mirrors etc everything you really need but the reason we would definitely return to this hotel were the staff they were all so warm and friendly and seemed like they genuinely wanted to make you comfortable from directions that were spot on to odd requests arie carmen sam hamilton and other employess whose names we did not have were the best this hotel is directly across from;4

we try not to stay in the middle of town the empire is located in the uws of manhattan literally across the street from lincoln center close to the subways and local buses off course taxi stand at main entrance very good eateries in the area that are within walking distance we always enjoy our stay here;4
i have stayed here several times while visiting new york most recently in julythis is a great historical hotel and centrally located with the subway just a few steps out the doorthe rooms are comfortable albeit small new york stylethe staff have always been friendly helpful and without exception have been able to accommodate my redeye check in it certainly could use a spring makeover but i will stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting new yorkthe hospitality location and affordability cant be beat;4

not a bad stay room was clean but they are definitely in need of a refurbishment which i believe they are starting it is in a good location this was our first time in new york and we felt like it was a really good location to see things and get to know the city we really did enjoy our stay service was not that brilliant but was ok is a good hotel for a stay in new york i would recommend mainly based on a good location;4

nice hotel with affordable rates carpet in hall could stand to be replaced but other than that a nice hotel with good staff there is a nice inner court yard surrounding area is pretty good close to subway;4
stopped here for 2 nights with 3 others had a 4 bed room to ourselves clean comfortable and 2 minute walk from tube station would use again if in the area lack of plugs in room so after reading previous reviews i brought an extension with 4 plug sockets got a few funny looks from friends initially but it was a godsend;4
over all the hotel is nice except no free wifi and coffee shower has no door and water is sprayed all over the floor when taking shower location is close to subway and a lot of restaurants century 21 is just a block away;4
although pricy the hotel is well placed just across the street from the met opera it is a great location for opera lovers like me our room had a view to the met opera great for the view but not so much for sleep as it can be very noisy during the night the bed was comfortable which is important for busy travellers or vacationers to be mentioned that i had to call every morning to request for the coffee capsules to be replenished in the room this should not be the case for a fourstar hotel overall we had a good stay and it is a great place to consider especially for those planning to attend events at the lincoln center;4
this is our first visit we stayed for 9 nights during spring break this year this is great value for good reasonable rate good location friendly staff clean quiet room and excellent breakfast id recommend this hotel to my friends;4

we stayed here for 5 nights during a recent vacation the bed and linens were great location was ideal for getting to see the most common tourist attractions my most favourite part of this hotel was the doorman jeff he was incredibly attentive and so friendly;4
my wife and i recently had a nice weekend getaway and visited universal studios in los angeles just the two of us without the kids for once we stayed at the hilton right across the street what a great location it is easy to find as it is right off the freeway and is only a five minute walk to and from universal studios entrance was really nice to just take a short walk to the hotel after a whole day at the park and just sit back and relax in the room the hotel overall is very nice and even though it had an early 80s feel it was quality work for the time period we were very happy with the room except for the tv and tv service will get to that in a moment the service from the guest services staff was excellent the hilton like other hotels uses text messaging;4
upon my arrival at the empire hotel and found out that my internet booking for this hotel was not in the hotel reservation system my booking was made by our staff and i had no idea how the booling was made i was quite upset and worried what to do lucily jerry a front desk receptionist not only helped get a room for me at the hotel but with a better deal than my internet reservation well done jerry and thanks for your warm help;4
my daughter and i have recently spent a week in new york based at the new yorker and could not have wished for a better place to stay the staff were brilliant nothing was too much trouble and a special mention for the lovely man that runs the history part of the hotel who went out of his way to show and explain about some of the famous people and venues that have occupied the hotel over the years the location of the hotel is very central and security is good;4
we arrived slightly stressed and a bit concerned about the neighbourhood but were warmly welcomed and check inparking was sorted swiftly we had hoped and were given a room over looking the courtyard as this looked nice in the photos but hadnt appreciated the small scale of it plus we shared a balcony with three other rooms not that we saw anyone and there was no furniture on the balcony to sit on or indeed in the courtyard although we were told it was having work done on it the room was nicely done out and had a fridge microwave etc sadly the fridge was noisy at times also letting the room down was the shower not the pressuretemperature but that the ceiling above the showerbath was lower than the rest of the room and had access panels with rusty paint around;4
front desk was friendly and efficient concierge help was spot on and security was comprehensive without being suffocating basic room was well appointed and clean could not ask more for moderately priced mid town room;4
love that the location was perfect and was able to take a shuttle to and from the hotel from the airport they also remodeled the rooms to a modern and fresh look with a great view of los angeles my son enjoyed the meal they offered and there was plenty of seating space for people to eat either in the bar or near lobby for their meals;4
we stayed here for 3 nights during our stay in london the hostel is nearbij the buss and underground station to go anywhere you want there where no dorm rooms availble so we had a room for just the 2 of us the room was large and very clean and had its own fridge the kitchen toilets and showers were very clean the hostel is very large and pretty noisy you hear doors slamming all night and they start to vacuum the hall at 7 in the morning the staff was a little strange they helped if needed but were a little uninterested the common room is nice and has computers the laundry room isnt much but there is one;4
just returned from our 1st visit to nyc and were very happy with our choice of the new yorker hotel its in a great location very central to everything on our list of things to see and do the hotel itself is full of old world charm the art deco design and dã©cor a nod back in time to the 1930s it felt truly authentic if you like identikitchain hotels that are the same in every city in the world then the new yorker is not for you but if you want to capture a sense of old new york then book this hotel our room had a fantastic view down to the hudson river and watching the boats sail by while having my morning tea is a memory ill treasure rooms were immaculate and we slept very well each night staff were pleasant and helpful no hassles on arrival or departure;4
i stayed in for 3 days with my husband and it was beautiful experience just 7 mins walking distance from universal studios the view outside my hotel room was amazing staff was very friendly and 24hrs available also as i am very particular about cleanliness i found the hotel and my room very neat and stood high on my expectations in short i would love to stay in hotel again 8;4
me and my mum stayed here for 6 nights in nov 2008 after reading reviews on here i was abit apprehensive about staying here so i thought i would ring the hotel myself and check that what i had actually booked was all in order they assured me it was when we arrived at the hotel i did think well its not the ritz but i hadnt paid that kind of money outthe hotel looked nice and what i would expect for upper manhattan the staff were really nice and helpful 24hour service alsoplus they got our booking right our room was very clean and warm and we had private bathroom the room was cleaned every day and our bed made every dayalso we had a tv in our room whcih was free the hotel isnt central but theres a metro stop just round the corner we used it every day its;4
staff were all very helpful room was very clean the interior of the hotel was nice liked the little extras like the bumble and bumble toiletries in the room great location right next to madison square garden and penn station the area was very busy around the hotel so maybe not ideal for every visitor we were a little cold one night and staff provided an extra blanket promptly;4
really enjoyed the hotel extremely quiet front desk were all helpful and very approachable i think the breakfast every morning was our favorite part everything was so tasty and the service from hugo and cinthya ridrugues was outstanding every morning they smiled and made our breakfast fast and extremely efficient even if they were busy pool area was gorgeous and really clean our room was a tad small but overall really great the taxi drivers told us were were not in the best or safest area in fact they told us it was ghettohowever we never felt any of that overall our stay was really great and yes we will stay again;4
stayed here for one night after running around universal for the day and it was perfect for purpose good clean big rooms with nice bathroom as youd expect parking is 17 and the studios are a 5 min walk;4
the service is out of this world got a free room upgrade as soon as i arrived room and shower are very comfortable the only small downside is the noise from broadway street close to subway stations one block away from central park walkable distance from times square theatre district top of the rocks etc;4
great locationwould come backfront desk staff very friendly especially majedgave us information about the city and surrounding areasi would recommend it to anyone who would like to be within walking distance from all major attractions;4
quick overnight in ny front desk staff very helpful doorman jeff very helpful tiny rooms even for nyc but very clean and well appointed barlounge not available though it is still listed on website we would stay there again because of the nice staff and cleanliness;4
stayed four nights in august 2006 and besides for the hot water not working for a few hours one night the stay was very nice the staff were very friendly and helpful with info about universal and the area only problem was that the conssieurs were on another floor and not available to speak with hotel shuttle was easy ride to universal and parking was not an issue very close to the interstate and all things in hollywood rode the subway to hollywood one evening only a short 10 min ride away and felt very safe parked at the subway stop down the hill a rather long walk uphill if you choose to walk hotel was clean ac worked fine and bath and room were very large for a family of four would definitely stay at this hotel again;4
i wanted to stay in new york two days my options were to stay overnight in new york or ride the lirr two days in a row back and forth from family in long island cost was a factor location was a factor and cleanliness was a concern for a amazing amount of 130 including taxes we stayed in a very clean studio apartment it was the size of an average hotel room but was well equiped a sofa bed a bistro tabel and chairs a small fridge toaster coffee maker 2 burner stove and real mugs glasses silverware the theme was contemporary with clean lines the bed appeared new firm without lumps the bathroom was all sleek marble tiles the towels were thick large and soft we had a streetside room and the building across the street was built in 1904 with awesome;4
we stayed at the new yorker this past monday for one night and it was a beautiful hotel we arrived earlier than the check in time and the person checking us in was nice enough to find a room that we could check into earlier the only real complaint i had was i asked him if it was the same kind of room that we reserved online a suite with queen bed wanted to make sure it had a separate bedroom because we were going with my daughter and her boyfriend and wanted privacy i had called the hotel prior to make sure it had a separate bedroom and was told yes he told me that it was indeed a suite but there was no separate bedroom no door to the room separating the bedroom from living space he said of all the rooms in the hotel there was no separate bedroom i was super;4
i stayed at the top floor which has the best rooms for a two star hotel its very good value one cant complain i didnt expect the bathroom to be this good new as u c in my photos the room is also new but i couldnt get a nice picture because of lighting the only thing i must mention is slow wifi elevators are slow and often congested 2 of the elevators r now out of service last time i stayed only 1 was out of service but as i said u can expect much worse for a 2 star hotel so i m not complaining if i wanted boutique hotel standard i would have booked myself into one;4
i go to lincoln center a lot via metro north from ct what a delight to spend a weekend in the city and be able to walk across the street to performances in other words the location couldnt be better the staff is also very friendly the room is perfectly adequate small by american standards but typical for new york or foreign capitals the bathroom however is a problem aside from being tiny theres no shower door so its almost impossible to keep water off the floor in the room is the standard keurig coffee maker but only the pods you find upon arrival are free replacements are 3 each i dont like that but i particularly dont like that theres no sign in the room telling me that i only learned by calling down to ask for replacements which by the way never;4
we stayed one night having left vegas and driven to get our flight from lax a good clean modern hotel friendly staff minus the lazy doormen who watched us struggling to get our luggage out of the taxi without offering to help and then offered as we approached the front door no doubt tip in mind the room was clean and up to date and we had views of the pool and airport well insulated so you dont hear all the noise outside except the odd rumble of a plane here or there best of all complimentary wifi which was most appreciated we had inroom dining which came quickly and was very nice a courtesy bus is provided to take you to the airport if you do wish was just perfect for us wed definitely stay again we recommend this hotel;4
very friendly and helpful front desk staff gave great directions to where we needed to go room very clean beds comfortable only negative would be the rather small bathroom i kept bumping my elbow on the sink;4
the location of this hotel on the upper west side of manhattan is ideal for all mta public transport systems the m104 bus and the subway lines 1 2 all stops located outside of the hotel dont worry about the hotel not having a restaurant there are many food outlets as well as restaurants all within a short walk from the hotel the hotel is serviced by a full reception who are extremely polite and always ready to help guests we checked into the hotel within a matter of 2 minutes after having a long journey there is full bell captain services who are also helpful with guest baggage and are always helpful with any questions you may have regarding your visit to nyc the hotel is very clean and comfortable we had a lovely king room and this was our third visit to this;4
i found this hotel on tripadvisor i read the reviews and was fully aware of the accommodations it was exactly as expected small clean good rate convenientl for my trip near subway staff pleasant and helpful id book this location again;4
this hotel is really good almost difficult to belive when one is in nyc where the general quality is quite low and the prices too high this hotel has a wounderful position 5 minutes walk from columbus square you can easily walk everywhere from the west side to midtown from central park to the upper east side in the morning you can even have your jogging in central park that is just few blocks away the hotel is also in front of the lincon center in case you have tickets there the room i was in a deluxe room with king size bed was to my surprise very big i had space to walk in the bed was comfortable the bathroom clean with a great shower it was also quite and could sleep very well even if my windows were on the 9th avenue and only at the third floor the;4
location was super nearby the subway 20 blocks to times square the only thing we were missing was the free wifi in our room clean and super friendly hotel great rooftop bar with a nice view if there was free wifi in the rooms wed come again for sure;4
although iâ´m not completely convinced that i will come back to this hotel specially in the summer since i was not aware that the rooms were not air conditioned we stayed in a private room captain cabin with a private bathroom the room is pretty nice in itself although it was pretty noisy from the rooftop bar the bed and all the amenities were great the location is unbeatable if you want a cheaper stay in the chelsea neighborhood;4
had a great experience location was perfect friendly staff neat tidy rooms perfect location if you wanna go to the universal studios as well which is a great place to go to only that could possibly improve would be the timing of the lift i had to use the stairs on one particular occasion bearing in mind my room was on the 20th floor;4
clean hotel close to universal studios reasonable price would stay again location if you buy a 2 day pass for universal studios then this is a great hotel to stay in its close walk to the theme park and also close to universal city walk for food we did catch the train into hollywood to check it out and do a day in la tour i felt the train was a bit threatening and i am normally fine on trains around the world i would recommend catching a taxi instead room clean room clean bathroom good view service reasonable service nothing spectacular but got the job done i recall the check in line was a bit long but nothing unbearable;4
i stayed at the ameritania hotel in times square nyc from october 4 â 9 2017 this hotel is amazing super clean and the dã©cor is really nice and chic this hotel has a great location and you can easily walk to many touristy areas of new york including times square for broadway shows and some amazing restaurants central park radio city 5th avenue and macyâs the staff at this hotel were awesome as well including the front desk staff especially yassin the bell hops julian morad and geoff geoff also arranged our car service for pickup at the hotel and drop off at the airport which was greatly appreciated and reasonable priced and course you cannot forget the twist lounge staff javier and maura the staff at this hotel certainly made our trip even better canât wait;4
consthe whole time during our stay there was an overwhelming noxious odor of marijuana coming from a neighboring rooms the bed and pillows were extremely uncomfortable to sleep on the ac in our room hardly worked the parking is expensive per night the dining options are pretty lackluster pros the bar is pretty nice and the guys working there were really friendly and accommodating the front desk and housekeeping staff were all very friendly the property was clean and well maintained;4
booked a last minute reservation which usually costs an arm and a leg in manhattan but got a great deal the room was conveniently located across the street from msg and was extremely nice the room was small but had every amenity and came at a great price;4
for our trip the location was key 8 blocks to our daughters place in chelsea and 8 blocks from midtown the staff was friendly and helpful with everything and anything we needed we requested an extra blanket and a few extra towels and the were at our room in a minute or two you will not feel more welcome anywhere else but home;4
even with a overbooked hotel they managed to give a great service will definitely go back best located hotel in ny in the middle of downtown just park your car and walk everywhere we stayed on the 21st floor kids wanted to stay in the hotel and look out the window;4
cannot beat location and overall accommodations if you are planning to visit universal studios hotel food and beverage options are adequate and food quality generally good hotel rooms are well appointed spacious and clean the hotel is in need of some refurbishing in the public areas but for a short stay and vacation use hard to beat location to universal studios and city walk staff is very helpful and courteous;4
lets face it if youre staying here its because youre trying to maximize your travel dollar in expensive new york i stayed here for six nights as a solo traveler and all the accommodations were adequate having stayed at a pod hotel in the city before i felt that this room utilized its space much better useful hooks and shelves made putting stuff out of the way fairly easy i did not hear the weekend club music in my room and didnt really run into anyone waiting in line for it outside the only concern of noise was the air conditioner and the closing of doors i use ear plugs so i slept welli suggest you do the same here the bathrooms were of no concern people mostly just went about their business in a quick manner my issues with this place are centered around;4
my wife and i stayed at the new yorker for four nights as part of our honeymoon the hotel is superbly located in mid town just a couple of blocks away from the empire state building the hotel looks splendid it was clean and comfortable and the art deco stylings are a joy the lobby looks amazing staff were very polite and helpful especially suzie on the concierge desk our room was a little on the small side but perfectly adequate for our needs with a good bathroom and shower i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again should we return to new york;4
its a nice clean safe reasonably priced hotel in new york with a 24 hour diner so for those reasons alone i have to recommend it like all hotels its great for some visitors and not great for others if you are comfortable using the nyc subway this is good hotel for you theres a good station right cross the street that you can use as a great starting point if you want to see an event at madison square garden or need to use penn station this is great choice msg is less than 1 block away if you want to shop at macys or visit the empire state building this is a good hotel if you arent comfortable using the subway this might not be great hotel there isnt a lot to do or a lot of touristy things in the immediate area you cant really walk to any of;4
we stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in early june and was very pleased with all aspects of our stay the hotel is in such a handy location easy access to public transport to get to so many places including universal studios griffith university walk of fame santa monica beach and venice beach to name a few the hotel itself is very pleasant and the staff were so friendly helpful especially jessica and gisel breakfast was included and more than adequate good value and definitely recommended;4
without free wifi and breakfast im only able to give it 4 out of 5 the location is perfect for your stay at manhattan beds are one of a kind and you are within walking distance to lower central park starbucks as your nearest neighbor the best way to start your day;4
i love the location it is the closest to universal studios and city walk i think that just the extra couple blocks of steps up hill to get to city walk and the park would disuade one from staying at the neighboring sheriton since hilton is so close we had no qualms about going back to the hotel to allow our little one to nap while dad our preteen swam in the pool then we would head back out for late afternoon at the park and even back to hotel and back out to city walk for the evening the pool is large heated and has cabana tents food and drink service i love that they have a little convienence refrigerator in the room we stayed at the hotel a couple years ago and spent the big bucks to get a tower room one of the special the top floors with view of universal;4
the hotel may have small rooms bot the location and service was great mohammed at the front desk helped resolve a booking issue the location was perfect for times square and broadway very convenient to be able to check bags after checkout and come back for them after another day in town;4
i fly in and out of lax a lot and usually drive down from a santa barbara and stay at this property this is a recently renovated very large property it has a good regency club with a fantastic manager called cairo the rooms are more like a hyatt centric than a regency including the really odd and frustrating lighting arrangements the great thing about this hotel however is itâs location i walk across sepulveda blvd to united terminal 7 and it takes me about 10 minutes from hotel to checkin desk the property abuts the quick park garage which is easily accessed from 96th street from the la tejera 405 exit on my return last week from wyoming i was off the plane into the car and on the road in 20 minutes two words of caution do not use the hotel valet;4
my husband and i spent 5 days here in september had a lovely time hotel and room spotlessly clean rooftop bar was lovely small but enjoyable would definately go back to the empireif we went to new york;4
the central location made getting around manhattan easy we loved the art deco style and the hotel museum in the basement was very interesting penn station and msg are right there the start of the highline is a couple of blocks away great new york style pizza at ny pizza suprema just down the street the tick tock on the ground floor was great for breakfast there is also a convienient vending area for quick breakfast items we also enjoyed a nightcap at the trattoria bianca mohammed was very helpful at checkin and was able to hook us up with a larger room with a kurig just like the waldorf astoria the new yorker has a long history and you should expect the rooms to show their age but it was a great place to stay and im sure that well be back;4
stayed here to break a trip between london and auckland the transfers fromto lax dont work particularly well especially at lax where a bit like a dogs breakfast but not something the hotel can control the rooms at the hotel were very good modern clean and good bed comfort room was quiet the club lounge was very good with an excellent selection of food and drink at ground level there is a kiosk where coffees and food etc can be purchased would stay again;4
arrived super late to his hotel because of a 5 12 hour flight delay the hotelâ was confused about the rooms even though this is a regular stay for our crew at this hotel at 1am the front desk attendant is asking me to sit and wait until he resolves the issues no i am not sitting and waiting in a corner after being late for 5 hourssomeone more efficient gave me a room i was exhausted and after i arrived to my room i though i should give myself a back up wake up call and god contacting the operator to set up a wake up call the phone rang 10 times each time i called format least 5 times and no one answered i finally gave up and went to sleep i cannot believe a 45 star hotel doesnât have someone to answer the phone at 1amgod forbid you are having a heart attack or;4
excellent accomodations terrific location in the lincoln center area lots of convenient eateries starbucks at the corner international clientele and employees expensive but worth it lobby bar more for datescozy conversation;4
i did have a few snags upon arrival and checkin but the staff was helpful and smoothed out the experience i was given a breakfast voucher to make up for the inconveniences the major issue was that i was assigned a room that was already occupied;4
the hilton while incredibly overpriced was a very nice average hotel its very close to universal studios which is great but if you want to do any sight seeing rent a car this hotel is far not a walking distance from the hustle and bustle of hollywood blvd the rooms were very nice and clean the beds were comfortable and the towels were soft we had a perfect view of the hollywood hills skyline and the amazing sunsets we did leave some things in the room and they have yet to be found that leaves a really bad taste in our mouths from an otherwise average experience the front desk staff is excellent but thats only if you have jose some of he others at the font desk are not so kind or helpful jose was amazing stay here only if you need to be near universal;4
great hotel some people think its dated however we thought it was full of charm we will stay here againthe location is superb right in the heart of the city attached to the hotel is the tick tock dinner great for breakfast;4
we would totally recommend the hotel new york weather was amazing june 2017 the roof top area was great for a little time out the pool is more a plunge pool but it was perfect during the heatwave;4
we were almost satified to stay at this hotel not only cleanlyness but also very close to public transportations;4
we stayed for three nights during our visit to the universal studio and sightseeing in la we didnt use hotel facilities much as we were out most of the time during the day it was conveniently located as we were able to walk to the universal studio give or take 510 minutes children were able to manage the walk without complain but there is an uphill slope so may not be for everyone room was spacious and clean staff were friendly one thing to note is that there was renovation for the elevator which was causing a traffic jam for the elevator meaning if you are on the higher floor it may stop every single floor going down you wait forever until the elevator comes or you give a miss for a full elevator and wait for the next one it didnt bother us as we incorporate;4
great loction however the views are not the best in some of the rooms the roof bar is great but a bit pricey the breakfasts are pretty terrible the staff were the most pleasant people i met in new york they knew the city and restaurants well the room was impeccable the bar service amazing for location price and service level i would stay here again without a shadow of a doubt the rooms are a bit small but of a high quality all in all its like a hilton good reliable and you know you will get the best service just avoid the room service breakfasts;4
hotel is generally comfortable although the bed leaves a lot to be desired location is great few steps from central park the time warner building subways a c b d 1 lobby is fancy and comfortable with free wifi no free wifi in rooms fitness facilities are rather poor;4
my son and i stayed for four nights visiting nyc as tourists we were looking for a budget hotel that had beds shower internet connection and was reasonably well placed this fitted well the beds were fine it was clean the staff friendly across the road from the northern end of central park and in a nice neighbourhood its a pretty basic hotel you pay 25 for three days internet good connection speed but didnt watch movies so i dont know they tell you where to take laundry unattended service is available the rooms are in need of a refresh but its well placed functional and for nyc prices especially given how central it is quite reasonable would go back again also we got a balcony which was a pleasant surprise i think we got lucky only real;4
we stayed at the new yorker hotel from sat 9 wed 14 march 2019 we flew with united airlines direct from edinburgh to newark getting to the hotel was pretty easy air train from newark about 30 to penn station then a 5 min walk to the hotel firstly the weather in march sunny and chilly not freezing but cold so a warm coat jumper helps most days were bright and sunny although it did rain one day some maybe something waterproof just in case next getting around we walked a lot so comfy shoes a must we also bought a metro 7 day ticket which allows you to use the underground sytem unlimited great for taking you from one of manhatten to the other stops also include brooklyn and bronx basically uptown 5th av midtown downtown world trade china;4
the jane is an excellent find in nyc its value for money a unique and quirky hotel with fantastically helpful staff and all in a lovely part of town close to the high line smack next to the river and on a clear day you look you can see the statue of liberty the rooms are snug but then being modeled on a ship thats to be expected ample storage free water free wifi even complimentary robes and slippers for those walks to the shared bathroom which are impeccably clean and enough of so you never well i didnt have to wait would definitely stay again the staff and the bar downstairs alone are enough let alone the great location and cost;4
the hotel is in a great location for going to universal studios it is a large modern structure that also caters to events weddings and such we noticed this because it was faster to get to the walkway leading to the pedestrian overpass for universal studios through their ballroom wing we were able to take the metro from there the walk is steeply uphill so we opted for the shuttle bus that took us to the city walk and got another shuttle back to the hotel from there it is all convenient check in was late â 4pm and we got there beforehand we were told they would have the room ready in about an hour so as not to hold us up â they promised to text or call â but they never did we got back after dinner so we assumed the room would be ready by then services were fairly slow;4
nice hotel with very pleasant service well located near sunset santa monica and hollywood boulevard excellent breakfast for american circumstances nice pool area only the parking fee 24 dollars a day is much too high;4
i was in ny for a trade show for several days my room was neat and clean and staff was very attentive look forward to staying here again;4
older hotel near northeast corner of 84th broadway very convenient location near columbia u plenty of restaurant options one bank of elevators not in service while i was there i had no problem but you may have to wait if you have a large party or lots of luggage ask for a renovated room;4
stayed at the empire for 3 nights in march 14 in a superior double room checkin was quick and efficient and all staff encountered were very helpful and friendly the room and entire hotel is decorated to a lovely standard clean and modern throughout maid service daily the room was spacious and had everything that you needed minifridge hairdryer iron etc the beds were a little firm for my liking but overall rather comfortable and sleeping was not a problem prices for the inroom snacks and drinks are expensive but there is a starbucks and duane reeds right next door so just buy from there one thing that did bother me was the temperature of the hotel it was too warm it was too hot to sleep under the covers however i arrived just after the polar vortex had;4
checking in was easy and quick but while the room was tidy there was a empty juice can in the bin old make up and it was obvious the bath hasnât been used in awhile with dust and dirt round the edges on the second night i discovered i was to be charged an administrative fee of â£40 that i was unaware of after insisting i didnât owe them this for two days they eventually removed it from my account the other staff were polite and friendly biggest bug bearer was the lifts once i had to wait 15 mins to get a lift they were always full no social distance on my last day the lift stopped altogether and had to go down the stairs i was on the 29th its ideally situated to most sights and the subway;4
stayed here 2 years ago for the convenience of being close to universal studios nothing has really changed since apart from the price which has doubled since my last stay rooms are ok lifts now working well did have to ask for the room to be cleaned to a better standard after checking in as lots of hair in the bathroom even on the ceiling however all resolved by good management;4
travelled from ireland to la for 10 nights and booked the hilton for the duration of our stay the location is great for universal and only a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station so canât fault on the location the staff are very helpful and friendly the only downside is the hotels restaurant we ate here twice and didnât like it either of the times although our waiter was one of the nicest people we have came across on our trip to la offering us advice and help if we ever needed it on our holiday the hotel also offers a shuttle bus to universal city walk which we took advantage of for dinner;4
this hotel has a shuttle service every 15 minutes from airport hotel was nice and staff friendly i got a late check out at no extra so i was happy with that i stayed in club room and used club restaurant facilities once very nice staff and food was quite good if you have time there is an outdoor pool which is nice to relax;4
my family and i total 6 there are 3 adults and 3 teenage children we visited universal studios and wanted a convienent place to stay this was it they have a tram that runs every 15 minso you never have to use your car while you are there they do charge 18 dollars a day to park though the rooms are great and the view if you are facing the right way is beautiful my only complaint is your choice of beds in the room your choice is 1 king or 2 full beds they dont have queen beds so it was a little uncomfortable when your used to a larger bed the breakfast was fabulous but very expensive this hotel is not cheap but i think its worth it i will stay here again next time we visit universal studios;4
stayed here for one night we needed somewhere to stay before we joined a cruise and our budget didnt really stretch to usual nyc prices this was so cheap we knew it was a bit far out but we really only wanted a place to lay our head for the night hotel was fine for us room was biggest we have ever had in nyc and clean a good way to do nyc if you are on a shoestring budget maybe worth buying a subway pass too though we walked and enjoyed the wlkbut that would probablyy get tiring if you were doing it every day theres a little deli a couple of doors along which did nice sandwiches and sodawe were too jet lagged to want to go far;4
this hotel is in a great location right across from lincoln center and just a couple blocks from columbus circle and central park theres nice subway access also my room was an adequate size but the bathroom was extremely small my toilet did not work properly and after bringing it to the attention of the front desk no engineer ever showed up to fix it however upon checkout mr ze did knock off 100 from my nights stay to compensate for that our business meeting was held on site the meeting room was very comfortable and our breakfast and lunch were quite good the great location would bring me back;4
the empire hotel is excellently located for anyone attending the metropolitan opera or other establishments in the lincoln center and is also quite convenient for sightseeing tour buses and central park it is within walking distance of times square and the carnegie hall but the concierge is pleased to call a taxi if you prefer everything was quite satisfactory in the hotel and the staff were very friendly and helpful however we felt that it was rather let down by some of the room facilities there was only a limited amount of hanging room for clothes and not quite enough drawer space for a stay of more than two or three days also we found the shower system somewhat complicated to adjust and use and it tended to splash the nearby floor if a slightly upgraded room;4
this hotel has a nice location in manhattan and two dinersrestaurants at the base the room is relatively small but to be expected in nyc its a bit dated so its not luxurious but adequate for staying in a safe nice place in nyc;4
ive stayed at the empire hotel several times the hotel is in a great location its a block from central park and across the street from the met museums and columbus circle are easily walked the hotel is flanked by 2 restaurants that are a convenience one is a popular drinking spot there is also a movie theater across the street starbucks and grocery the hotel has charm but its a little delapidated there is a rooftop pool and the roof becomes a nightclub on the weekends this is a fun hotel for girls weekend or for a reliable place to stay when going to the theater if they update the worn out patches id give it 5 stars for all the perks;4
an amazing stay with a great view of the river hotel was clean and i was well looked after hoping to come again soon when next in new york wifi included with the stay which was great and loved the staff so friendly and always happy to help;4
the ameritania hotel is a good hotel in midtown manhattan itâs location is perfect just on broadway and a short stroll to times square the room we had was a regular sized nyc hotel room with ensuite the only issue we had was with the safe which was placed on the floor of the wardrobe so you had to lie on the floor to set the code to open and close the safe we instead kept our valuables looked in our suitcases all the staff in this hotel were welcoming helpful and efficient for breakfast we recommend applejacks american dinner which is just up the street from the hotel;4
great location to get to universal studios it was clean and view was nice staff was friendly and professional the beds were small and not the best but ok it had everything else we needed we didnt order room service but the choices looked great we were just too busy exploring the city to eat there there is so much to do near and around this hotel it was a great choice for us they could update the decor but all in all it was very nice;4
i came here for 3 nights for a conference but my family tagged along the room was quite spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 young children and it was very clean the staff members were helpful when we had questions and we were given a complementary basket of fruitwater and cookies on our first night housekeeping was excellent they really did a nice job cleaning our room each day universal studios is about a 10 minute walk away but this walk is difficult if you have a stroller or wheelchair or if you have problems with stairs however there is also a free shuttle that runs about every 15 minutes there are plenty of places to eat at city walk but if you plan to visit anywhere else in la youll need a car i have only a couple of complaints the physical layout is;4
my wife and i were looking for an affordable hotel in nyc mainly because we didnt need a fancy hotel since our goal was to make the most of our trip to the city and just use the hotel to rest well astor on the park fit the bill and when i go back to nyc ill definitely stay there again its located at the northwest corner of central park and has 2 subway stations only a block and a half away a bus stop is also very close the area was quite safe and well lit at night but there werent too many options to eat at night except for a convenience store on the same block the rooms were small but cozy and clean the bathrooms were very clean and had no problems with leaks noises or whatever we switched rooms after our first night since we wanted a room with a view to the;4
my wife and i have just returned from a 7 day stay at the astor on the park we found it very comfortable clean and excellent value for money the staff were helpful and friendly at the time of booking we asked for and got a room overlooking central park the room was fine far from luxury but more than adequate although the hotel is quite a way uptown it is very accesible by subway the station is just 2 blocks away but we mainly used the bus m10 that stopped right outside the hotel and takes you to the heart of midtown manhattan a weekly ticket for unlimited use on buses and subway costs just 24 a cab from times square to the hotel costs 13 we actually enjoyed being a bit further away from the tourist areas it felt more like staying in the real new york some;4
the staff is very helpful and nice the rooms are big and spacious for four the house keeping is the best by far the coffee shop is no starbucks but is good my family stayed for the celebrity experience event overall my experience was great;4
by far not the best hotel in new york but ive stayed in days inns before both in the us and uk and this was the cleanest and had the comfiest bed had 3 excellent nights sleep and although the room is really really dated and well used it was comfy and clean excellent chambermaids they must have taken before pictures when the changed the bedding as everything was exactly where we left it as well as folding all our clothes they also went the extra mile and left my sons newly purchased woody and zerg toys hugging each other on his pillow bit out of the way but we walked to times square everyday and it only took about 30 minutes;4
im now on my last night staying at the empire hotel and i have to say its great there are a few bits and pieces that youd want fixed eg the doors dont close properly on their own so its happened a few times that the employees have knocked and asked if it was left open by mistake awesome service though but its overall a great place to stay in new york location is amazing and for the price awesome kudos to zuli for help with great breakfast;4
i have been a repeat customer of the new yorker for years and never had a back problem prior this year the mattress was way too soft and i could barely get dressed andor walk after my first night sleeping on my back unfortunately i did not realize the cause until i got home if i had i would have hoped they had a bed board available other than this setback i found the restaurant and tick tock diner very good and with efficient workers;4
excellent location easy access to times square we were on 4th floor so had some noise from street staff was helpful and polite we experienced long delay in getting our room then had some confusion about which rook we should have rooms are small even for nyc but adequate and clean bathrooms were very modern but limited space nice lobby cold when we were there and not sure why huge fireplace was not on;4
we had a very enjoyable 4 day stay at this hotel which has an excellent location walking distance to times square the hudson river and the empire state building and right across the road from penn station room was a little dated but large and comfortable with a view across to the hudson river would stay there again;4
our room was clean and comfortable on the 32 floor but no city veiw there was a facility charge of 160 for 4 nights and 132 resort fee although there is free wifi in the lobby area and we had our own data the receptionist said it was a facility fee and it had to be paid by credit card no explanation was given to what it actually covered there was a diner just off the lobby the food is nice and plenty of variety also a tea and coffee station again at a higher charge than starbucks across the road would i stay here again no for the price we paid for this accommodation it was disappointing the lobby was all show but the decor of the rooms were tired and outdated there were 2 bottles of water in the room but these were at a charge if opened the facility charge is a;4
the rooms are very small with no closet however i learned to utilize hooks shelving etc soon everything had a spot bathroom down hallway no problem accessing toilet and sink but shower on my floor was never available when i needed it you can use one on another floor though restaurant was great spot for breakfast hotel staff was friendly and helpful the room rate cant be beat in fact i am returning in april for another stay its quirky but it works fine for me;4
i stayed at this hotel for 5 nights while attending a conference at the hotel heres the good the bad and the ugly the good just a short walk or complimentary shuttle ride to universal studios city walk with numerous shops and restaurants to choose from an absolutely beautiful weekend brunch buffet a great bar with friendly staff even with a few conventions at the hotel ezra always greeted me by name and took fabulous care of me during my stay tip theres a complimentary happy hour with cheese crackers veggies chips including their delicious housemade potato chips and a hot item spa water available in the lobby with very tiny little cups one hour complimentary internet access per day and a relatively decent daily rate of 795;4
the hotel looks a little out of date but rooms are comfortable staff is friendly and location is fine very near to the la metro so if you want to avoid traffic breakfast is for american standards ample one can see this hotel caters for europeans as well;4
hotel is very close to universal studios they offer a shuttle every 15 minutes to and from attractions there is also easy access to use walkway that takes approximately 10 minutes self parking is available for 2800 a day with unlimited in and out access the hotel staff is very knowledgeable and helpful the pool is open until 1200 midnight and very nice and clean pool service is also available i would definitely stay and recommend this hotels;4
i really enjoy this hotel its in an ideal location for the city close to the park and near the red subway line the neighborhood is great often when i stay they upgrade my room luis was a big help last time;4
hotel was very clean and staff was excellent it was in a great area within walking distance of everything i needed to do i would definitely recommend it and would stay there again in the future when i come back;4
good location very convenient to visit museum central park and many theaters but a little expensive i stayed this hotel 2 times i will book and stay ameritania at times square for my next visit to new york city;4
this hotel is in the perfect location if you want to visit universal its walking distance to the park entrance about as far as you would walk from the parking lots but there is also a shuttle i actually stayed here on a business trip and didnt visit universal the walk down to the metro station is about 10 minutes downhill a huge hill theres a shuttle to take you back up the hill if you want but it goes to city walk not the hilton another shuttle will take you back to the hilton or you can walk the room itself was large and clean the beds were really comfortable bathroom was spacious the tub definitely had some wear and tear though the plumbing for the shower was a pain it would drip constantly and never turn completely off biggest complaint about the hotel;4
excellent staff and service rooms were very clean beds comfy but small no kings in this hotel and the queen seemed like a full room very small i would definitely return because the staff was great locations excellent and even the two choices of food on site were good;4
this is my third time staying at the empire each time i have a good experience the staff is always nice and helpful its a great location you can either walk to a ton of places or grab the train either at lincoln center or columbus circle to places further away the rooms are small if you need a large room you should book a suite or choose another place however if you are like me and are only using a room for sleeping showering and changing clothes then its perfect i had a standard queen the king rooms are a little bigger but not by much so i just opted for the queen the club is nice or if you want something quieter you can hang around in the in the lobby or on the mezzanine they have great seating in those places if you want to have a drink and relax;4
the jane hotel has a perfect location for visiting the jazzclubs in greenwich village its also close enough to the subway so the rest of the city can be reached easily the small room i stayed in was no problem and even to share the toilet and barhroom was no problem at all;4
the staff is helpful friendly and easily offers suggestions for activities dining and transportation the beds are heaven and i really appreciated having a makeup mirror in the bathroom i only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant but the food and service were both delightful the location is excellent for universal studios and city walk i think the views are great from all the rooms was surprised wifi was not free and missed having a soda machine on the floor;4
after moving our daughter to la we stayed and played for a few days at the hollywoodthe great loved the location wrt proximity to what we dideasy well as easy as it can get with la traffic to get to places like the zoo or the observatory etc loved the hotel setupnice sized rooms clean pool is wonderful and in its own little semiprivate courtyardyou forget its next to the parking lot our room was second story overlooking the street but still quiet enough for sleeping im thinking the rooms overlooking the inner courtyard are even better and thats what we will request next time the morning breakfast is fab as it includes eggs made to order and special shoutout to sonia who was wonderful fixing my omelet just how i wanted every day but;4
excellent location very close to subway station central park lincoln center lots of great restaurants close by pool was closed when we were there no housekeeping on our last full day due to staff shortage;4
the hotel was very good with excellent service the breakfast was really good although not cheap around 70 for 2 there is a shuttle to universal city every 10 min for free which is really really helpful the location in my opinion is one of the best as itâs far from the traffic and has a good view and itâs close to the metro the rooms are clean room service excellent but a little problem was with ventilation as there are no windows that u can open in the rooms but thatâs not a big problem overall the hotel is very good and clean with great service and the staff is super kind and nice we had a good time in la and i recommend it for everyone;4
this was where we stayed for our 2018 girls trip to nyc location is close to macyâs empire state building starbucks restaurants and the subway it was a short walking distance to time square broadway plays radio city music hall train station as for the hotel the sink in my room wouldnât drain the shower was such hat you needed to get in to start the water comfortable bed and quiet dark room iâd stay here again but there were âhiddenâ fees of almost 30 my 159 a night resulted in a 209 stay they put a 45 hold on my card but i expected that;4
i drove myself nuts reading internet reviews here and elsewhere about hotels in the hollywood area it seemed like most every place had its severe detractors finally i decided to give this place a try despite some negative reviews and im glad i did the room was clean the furnishings a bit above average and the beds were nicevery comfortable the bathroom was a bit small but not too bad the staff was courteous but i did not need any sightseeing information so i cannot speak to that my room was on the second floor and the nearby ice machine was broken not a big problemjust had to take the elevator down and use the one on the first floor in the same location the continental breakfast was a bit better than expected im not used to much eggs sausage;4
we stayed in the hilton a week ago we were on the top level of the hotel looking down on universal the room was very spacious as was the bathroom only downside was the water pressure was vey low staff were extremely friendly and helpful great location for universal even though we didnt go hollywood boulevard is about 10 minutes uber away very clean hotel and would definitely stay again;4
we stayed here for the purpose of visiting universal studios and we were not disappointed just a few minute walk it was what you expect from a hilton clean and tidy the âcityâ view from our 17th floor room was impressive;4
i have stayed at this hotel numerous times in the past in fact my son spent his honeymoon night here the hotel used to be a ramada inn the location in vermont is convenient for the area the parking out back is secure the cost is reasonable for the area breakfast is provided between 630am and 1030 am on the weekend expect a long line for the omelets if you wait to 830 the breakfast includes juices coffee and cereals leave room for sausages and potatoes handle is right and you could skip lunch the rooms have been nicely upgraded wood floors and nice decor like most hotels outlets for your electronics is limited the hallways are nicely improved with sconce lighting and plush carpets the ceilings have a nice art deco feels overall this hotel i think is;4
it was a weekend stay only used room to shower groom sleep bedding is excellent which is top on my list my sincerest thanks to hector from bell services who helped us from the moment we walked in until we took our taxi to the airport by answering all questions giving us tips will definitely return;4
this is a nice hotel to stay at when you are popping in and out of la easy access to the airport friendly and helpful staff clean rooms and great food the club access is totally worth it we had a delicious fresh breakfast for free and the staff was super friendly and the environment was relaxing;4
stayed for 4 nights with the family was on the 23rd floor room 2109 it was very clean and cosy the only thing that was bad was the one window that let a really bad draft through and made it very cold the hotel sells tickets for the bus tours and they sell them cheaper than the guys that work on the streets as they work on commission they add 1020 extra so buy them from the hotel also had to pay an extra â£90 when we arrived for the hotel services so when they say wifi is free technically it isnt;4
we stayed here for our first anniversary and requested a room high up with a view we were on the 36th floor and the views were amazing i would recommend this hotel if youre looking for something nearby and will be spending most of your time exploring like we did the room is small but was cleaned every day and towels changed daily too the staff are very friendly and are always happy to help the area around the hotel isnt great but there is a lot of police presence around the busy areas so we didnt feel unsafe just be careful as you would in any other major cities the mcdonalds across the road is a bit dodgy so avoid if you can but the hotel is so close to the subway and all the popular cafes bagel shops etc its close to times square which can get very busy we got;4
i cant enough good about sherry and jose at the desk and heather in the lounge everyone was so nice and made us feel welcome thank you for the upgrade as well with so many nice hotels in new york to choose from in the end the right choice is made based on superior customer service see you soon jim dana bruton connecticut;4
the room was much smaller than expected the double bed just about fit in the room having said that we had a stunning view of the empire state and madison square garden the room was clean but absolutely freezing the cold seeps through the old windows we was using the window seal as a fridge we did have ac so slept with the heater on all night walking distance to all tourist hot spots big bus tour stops right outside plenty of barsrestaurantsdelissupermarkets around to get all that you need the tick tock cafe linked to the hotel was delicious would recommend stopping there for breakfast overall a great stay would return in the springsummer to not have to sleep in the freezing cold room;4
me my partner stayed here for our 40th birthdays the location of the hotel was good the room was lovely clean the view from the room faced out onto a brick wall but the roof terrace made up for it bar swimming pool with great views of the city staff on the front desk were polite and friendly would definitely stay here again;4
comfortable rooms if a little small excellent room facilities shower etc very convenient to major tourist sites shopping theatres etc in manhattan aircon was a bit noisy friendly and helpful staff overall very happy with our stay here;4
location was excellent 10 mins walk to universal city and the park parking was easy although not cheap the swimming pool was clean and very warm with a good pool bar staff very helpful rooms were typical of a hilton clean with 2 good sized beds have to pay for wifi;4
as expected our room was very small with bunk beds my spouse has stayed there several times now with great success very reasonable rate be prepared for small room and shared bathroom bathroom was very clean i only had to wait on shower one day for short time we stayed three nights staff is wonderful need ice bucket no problem need fresh set of towels no problem the window unit air conditioner was noisy but did work well they have bicycles for use by guests 7 am 6 pm nice location to ride bikes along hudson bike path the high line is very close also for wonderful stroll northward many cafã©s and market nearby in meat packing district if you dont want to share a bathroom i suggest staying elsewhere i would stay again;4
the empire hotel in nyc greets you with charm and elegance as you enter the hotel you are surrounded by rich textiles and staff that is more than accommodating everyone is wonderful and willing to help you have a fabulous stay the lobby bar is beautiful and the decor throughout the hotel is topnotch the pool is a little small more so a lap pool for one but it sits upon the rooftop overlooking midtown manhattan the lincoln center is just outside your door with a beautiful fountain and open area to enjoy just around the corner is central park where you can rent bikes or catch the subway to downtown or uptown manhattan everything is truly close the beds are cozy but the bathrooms could use a little love fans would be great the bathroom had a lot of water damage;4
great location comfort and service zuli and helena at the front desk are supremely competent and their smiles will make your day;4
located just steps away from times square this hotel is nicely furnished and well kept the staff was very helpful and always willing to go the extra mile would definitely stay there again even though there were some issues that happened during the stay the management really tried to make everything great;4
we recently stayed at the new yorker for 5 nights and found it to be clean and comfortable the location is great for msg times square penn station and empire state there are plenty of places to eat near the hotel at a reasonable price the hotel is approximately a 10 minute walk to times square and broadway in the morning the hotel has a take out breakfast stand which is very popular although we didnât eat here so canât comment on the quality or price but the queues spoke for themselves the only issue is with the lifts in the hotel they take a very long time to arrive and often when they do arrive theyâre too full to even try to squeeze into resulting in a further wait one day some of our party who were staying on the 28th floor waited 15 minutes for a lift to;4
the empire hotels great location served as a terrific base for a weekend in nyc for my wifes 30th birthday we were upgraded to a king deluxe room overlooking the lincoln center which made our stay that much more pleasant the room was quite spacious and well appointed and the bed was fresh and comfortable we found all the staff from reception to housekeeping to be very attentive and friendly thanks ms baldwin;4
we stayed in this hotel for 3 nights hotel is nice and like a tower its 04 miles away from universal studios and also very near from famous hollywood walk of fame the furniture is a little bit old fashioned style the rooms have fridge included staff cleaned the room everyday staff is really friendly and helpful they have wide variety of food but its a little expensive parking charges are 27night if you need water you have to pay atlest 399 for a small size water bottel so it is advisable to buy your own stock of water bottles with you view was nice from my 7th floor;4
stayed here in jan 2017 for our family visit to universal studios whilst the most affordable rooms are the usual standard 2 bed setup you cannot get any closer to the action the staff are great we didnt have the expensive buffet preferring to go to one of the many places at universal walk where it is much cheaper still cant believe that in this day and age and given the cost of the rooms its not cheap a hilton hotel doesnt offer complimentary wifi in the rooms only in the foyer area do management realise that people will actually chose another hotel based on this alone its the way of the world people get with it;4
overall i enjoyed my time at the empire hotel the staff were very helpful and welcoming my room was clean quiet and warm i arrived on the coldest weekend that new york had had for a year and being australian i felt it every time i walked outside the bar fridge supplied was too small and the wallpaper needed attention are my only negative comments about my room the empire is well located for most of new yorks attractions and i would certainly recommend it to anyone i new that was traveling to new york;4
we stayed on the second level booked a double room was pretty good for a hostel room small bar fridge wardrobe cups plates and cutlery the bar fridge was great because we could actually buy milk and cold meats such a relief the staff were also really helpful the printer was out of order so they just printed stuff off for free also really close to the tube which is great towels are changed every two day which is nice the cons the kitchen doors on all levels have no dampener so they slam shut and echo through all the hallways which is a bit annoying when its 10pm and you have to be up at 430am for a flight the walls are also super thin and you have to pay for wifi which is a bit of a bummer the shower layout just plain sucks there is no ledge or anything to;4
comfortable beds customer service at front desk is excellent the closest hotel to universal studios 5 minute walk to the entrance they also provide free shuttle to universal studios it runs every 15 minutes;4
if planning a visit to universal studios this hotel is a great choice 10 min walk or a 5 min bus ride away the bus runs regularly the convenience is the best thing about this hotel the room was big and comfortable but dated we ate in one of the hotel restaurants and it was good the hotel bar was nice also the staff were quite friendly;4
we stayed at this hotel for 5days with no problems for the price i found that the hotel totally met our needs positives include price location friendly staff and daily breakfast that was very good a downside to our stay was the size of our room though this was a downside we were fine as we spent very little time there the staff also assisted with locating a flat fee based cab company when i was in a rush to my graduation at usc;4
great location for coming in from penn station friendly staff and easy check in and out room was very cold due to ac not being able to regulate well i would stay there again i walked to times square at night it was a lot of fun and an easy distance from the hotel the rooms were recently redone on my floor so the bed and furnishings were nice and very comfortable the bathroom and shower were updated too and worked very well;4
i stayed here in march 2017 the hotel is nice and i booked my room for a very good price it is a 15 min walk to times square but it is close to some shopping districts the hotel is very busy but the service is very good and when i asked for something it was delivered to my room right away the room was clean but a bit small i was staying alone and i was able to manage though coffee machine available upon request as well as refrigerators my room wouldnt have taken a refrigerator anyway the bathroom was also small and a bit outdated i dont recommend tick tock diner at all over all it was a nice stay in this classic hotel will definitely stay here again;4
ive stayed in the county hall several times and have never been disappointed the location is great the only disappointment is they are going to out price themselves it is getting so expensive i think premier inn should introduce a loyalty discount;4
a great location if youre planning to visit universal studios but like most themepark amenities the hotels services tend to be overpriced compared to other hilton locations if you stay during a weekend be sure to try the seafood and prime rib buffet which is comparable to the vegas buffet experience;4
great location close to times square staff definitely went the extra mile special mention has to go to jeff the doorman for his knowledge and advice on attractions close to the hotel no request was too small;4
if you plan on visiting universal studios then this hotel is ideally placed the park itself is only a few minutes walk but there is also a free shuttle for those less able or lazy in my case there is also a metro at the bottom of the hill that provides quick access to hollywood the hotel itself is very well equipped and the size of the rooms is very generous having universal citywalk so close by we never dined at the hotel but saw a very attractive seafood buffet laid out the only negative thing which stopped me giving 5 stars were the elevators they were so slow in coming with about 5 or so elevators you wouldnt have thought there would be an issue but waits of 5 plus minutes were the norm not the exception and of course by the time one did come they would often be;4
very nice stay charming room only complaint is that there was no minibar in the room there were snacks on the dresser but no cold drinks or coffee opportunity i will continue to use this as my go to hotel in the city;4
we stayed at the empire hotel on this special long weekend we were not disappointed location fantastic as regards to central park the subway to access the rest of manhattan and everything else you go to ny for the staff were both friendly and helpful the hotel itself is clean and tidy all be it a little tired in parts although the general feeling is of opulence and quality and very comfortable the linen and towels were fresh daily with soaps etc plentiful in short i would not hesitate to return to the empire next time i find myself in new york;4
i would have given this hotel a top rating except for two things shower water pressure is pathetic i dont know if this is a new york city thing or not also my in room internet service was spotty at best other than thatits a nice place;4
our room wasnt ready on arrival but they did keep our luggage in a locked room we were on honeymoon and i think we received an upgrade as the room was a lot bigger than expected our room was lovely but as others have said before you need to watch out paying for extras it is also a real disappointment that there is no free wifi in the room i know we are in new york but everywhere has free internet so it is a big inconvenience when your on holiday not to have it it was also quite expensive to buy the hotel was in a great location close to central park;4
my wife and i were due to stay in this hotel for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon however due to an issue arising from our next destination we remained in universal city for an extra 4 nights on our arrival we were immediately upgraged to a king sized room at no extra cost the hotel is perfect for visiting universal city by day and the universal citywalk by night were there are many restaurants shops and cinemas to keep anyone entertained during the second half of our stay there we hired an vehicle from the ever so helpful conceirge dora who treated us like a mother away from home and found that we were close to most of las tourist sights such as hollywood farmers market rodea drive santa monica long beach and malibu great service the breakfast is good if;4
very close to universal which comes in very handy with 2 young children ages 5 7 when it all gets a bit too much special mention to andrã©s at front desk check in who went out of his way to make our check in very quick and smooth and also vic at the transportation desk who organised our transfers to griffith observatory and back rooms are clean and tidy and buffet was ok but probably just as easy to walk out to universal city for a meal;4
stayed here as a couple for 4 nights 40 mins drive from lax the exterior doesnt seem much but it appears that the rooms and hallways had been renovated the rooms bathroom and furniture was just as new we would definitely be back pros free breakfast hot and cold selections freshly made omelette and waffles made to order they limit to only 1 omelette pperson free and strong wifi coffee bar fridge and microwave in store car rental office next to reception for easy hire approx usd100 pday for a kia 58 mins drive to hollywood blvd cons room is smaller than the typical american size bed is a double bed maybe too small for some parking at hotel is expensive no wardrobe handing rack provided only;4
i like staying at the hilton universal but was disappointed this time around they charge 795 per device in the rooms not per day disappointed it seems hilton is nickel and diming our baggage was unloaded into one cart from our car when i called for it they had separated into 2 carts a nice young kid brought the first cart explain what they had done stunned a short time later an older gentleman came and tossed the luggage like sacks of potatoes i was alarmed as my laptop was one of the items he then stood there waiting for a tip i tipped him to get rid of him i would have preferred the nice younger gentleman to have brought the luggage himself room service lady was rude when she called at 9am i did not get a chance to explain anything she was a;4
spent three nights here did universal on day one just over the road plus free shuttle bus to the park if feeling particularly lazy metro just across the road as well one stop to hollywood boulevard and walk of fame etc great pool with very attentive staff only two minor gripes lifts very slow and breakfast a bit pricy but overall a very pleasant stay and a fabulous location to explore la;4
indeed the rooms are tiny and bathrooms are shared yet who spends all day in a hotel room in new york this was also great on my business budget rooms and shared bathrooms were spotless cleaner than most hotels ive stayed at recently staff were always friendly and helpful loved the retro bellhop and housekeeper uniforms the place is a bit quirky look for the monkey behind the front desk bed was a bit stiff but towels robe and slippers were soft on site restaurant is eclectic with a bohemian vibe and serves delish meals try the salmon pie yum great location and although near subway stops i chose to walk to midtown daily things of note dance party usa seemed to rock on at midnight or so walls arent thick and i could hear music coming from somewhere at;4
this hotel is perfectly located for universal studios â just a short walk away which is what our main aim was it was also easy to get to from the 101 the room was large and clean and included in the price was a buffet style breakfast which was very varied and more than adequate grounds of the hotel were lovely and staff very friendly â car parking was 10 would definetely stay here again;4
this is my second stay at the hilton universal again for a visit to universal studios you cant beat the location for the park and having city walk with a large variety of restaurants its a one stop shop if you do want to venture out to other hollywood locations they are not too far away from this hotel with plenty of travel options one being the metro train too get there our room was a great size for 2 adults and our 11 year old son we had a great view looking over universal studios staff were friendly and helpful we had room service which was great with a decent size menu to pick from we did not use the pool this time as it was winter but its a great part of the hotel we had a drink at the lobby bar one afternoon which happened to be at happy hour so the free;4
stayed here many years ago but much has changed particularly in the lobby which looks much better on checkin we were invited to a desk where miguel efficiently allocated a room which was upgraded because we were wyndham reward members it was a bigger room than we had originally booked and had a splendid view of the empire state the room had obviously been refurbished although the bathroom hadnt with its original taps and bath still perfectly usable though only slightly annoying thing was a couple of occasions when we had been out all day in mid90s temperatures only to return to find the air conditioner had been turned off soon cooled down though and the wifi had to be logged into afresh every day then there was the notorious facility fee not mentioned at;4
we stayed at this hotel for five days in november hoping that it would be better than the hudson hotel where we stayed last year on the whole it was better although our room on 22cnd floor was tiny at least we had a decent sized bathroom not the teeny weeny one at the hudson we would have loved to have had coffee making facilities in the room instead of the luke warm bottle of water left for us at an extortionate price we looked forward to using the tick tock cafe attached to the hotel during our stay as the reviews were quite good all i can say about it was that some people are not choosy we thought the food was mediocre and very priceywe only went the once it was better than our last hotel but one the hudson it was quite shabby in places and needs some careful;4
we didnt stay here but went to meet friends on the rooftop bar it is fabulous and the views are amazing over the hudson and towards the wtc well worth a visit and the hotel is so historic that its even more interesting than just the bar;4
i am a repeat guest and i feel like the staff at the empire really pays attention to your needs despite what must be a pretty heavy rotation of guests all my requests were promptly taken care of the rooms are comfortable there is coffee in the room something that isnt standard in nyc hotel rooms there is a charge but it is only 3 which is less than if you go to starbucks i love the toiletries i love the location across from lincoln center having room service etc bell men are very attentive ask for an outside room the inside rooms are very dark the outside rooms which i have had on my last two visits have great views of lincoln center from many of them;4
this hotel was very nice the decor is very good the roof top bar is good at night pritty expensive but its new york city and your in a roof top bar so you dont expect it to be cheap very clean hotel beds changed every day the cleaner even folding up all my clothes i left out all the staff are very friendly the bed is possible the best hotel bed ive slept in its in a very good location metro stop 5 minutes walk away if you going to new york id stay here;4
this hotel was in a great location our first night we were in a handicapped room with no view on the 4th floor when i asked the front desk to move us they were accommodating and moved us to the 12th floor with a great view for the rest of our stay that was fabulous the breakfast is expensive so we ate in city walk also the parking attendants were snooty and didnt seem to want to help me find where to get on the shuttle the location is great for universal studios and anything you want to see in hollywood ie any of the other studio tours or hollywood blvd;4
this hotel is a great deal the property is very unique the rooms are very small but designed like an old ships cabin the restrooms are down the hall the restaurant is very good the lounge is classic the staff is wonderful;4
first time in new york and we found the hotel to be right in the heart of broadway and times square brilliant for getting bearings we had a delux room as we were 3 adults but room was quite small with limited storage but bathroom was very nice and clean rooms were also quiet no street noise or from other hotel rooms staff and door men were very friendly and helpful breakfast was limited choice and more expensive than restaurants in the area so easier to go out overall given the location this was a very good choice of hotel;4
overall everything was fine friendly staff especially in reseption doormen were very helpful too room was clean and spacious there was fridge and closet which was great floor 35 with spectacular views;4
great location for exploring with children very near to a great playground waterloo tube station london eye etc staff very helpful bedroom great shower over bath not great for getting in and out of and would have loved a fridge to have cold water gluten free toast available at breakfast along with most items from cooked breakfast would have appreciated some gluten free cereals and porridge pots and for this reason we ate somewhere else on our last morning as i didnât want cooked breakfast again would definitely return;4
we enjoyed our stay here although there is lobby construction check in was smooth and staff were friendly we paid extra for executive floor and continental breakfast the room was great room 2255 has view of hollywood hills and pool it was great noise was minimal the room was somewhat plain but spacious the bed and pillows were very comfortable bathroom was very clean and new the breakfast gave us a great start lots of options for a continental meal with really fresh fruit the coffee was strong and delicious we appreciated the help from the concierge and the bellhops in planning a day sightseeing and shopping the pool was great and the jacuzzi even better while the food overall was pricey the coffee shop was good we loved the closeness to city walk and;4
across from lincoln center two blocks from central park a few blocks from columbus circle and subway lines the hotel is clean and our room a corner suite was spacious cant vouch for the rest busy restaurant on rooftop pool is just a bathtub with style we are always treated with courtesy and helpfulness maid service is top notch;4
slightly sketchy area but generally felt safe a few blocks up vermont and its a totally different story with beautiful bars and restaurants the hotel on the whole is well maintained but if you stay long enough you begin to notice little things which are in need of renovating beds very comfortable good air conditioning shout out to wendy who looked after us very well;4
pros service overall had a good experience with service at the front desk and at the lobby bar and the doormen were great with taxis location this isnt a part of nyc i normally stay in usually stay in les but thought it was a good area lots near by and pretty views room overall the room was nice there was enough room for a queen bed a small table and a chair compact but not overly small especially given the price cons bathroom was super tiny at first i didnt mind but then was annoyed with zero counter space it was literally just the sink basin and when showering water got everywhere didnt help that they didnt provide a bath mat not business friendly when i cant find an outlet anywhere then i know theyre not built for business;4
this is a very good nyc hotel with a superb location for those who enjoy lincoln center theater ballet symphony and broadway which is a 15 minute walk away there are ample places to eat within 2 blocks with varying prices and cuisine the hotel dining room provides an excellent breakfast and there is a starbucks two doors down subway access for all the lines is within a 2 block radius you can go anywhere in nyc from the emprie;4
had a great stay here in june very busy time with summer and families at the hotel along with nba draft room was quaint but had everything i needed had a rear facing view and could see the hudson river quiet room on the back side will stay here again on my next visit to nyc;4
i have just returned from a 4 night stay at the empire hotel great location well suited to tourists with lots on your doorstep including a great bar restaurant next door and a starbucks for your breakfast hotel room very comfy we were on the 2nd floor didnt have any issues with the water or ac like a lot of reviewers did we also didnt have any waiting for lifts again like a lot of other reviews mentioned if i had to add anything negative then that was having to pay for hot drinks in the roomwe just nipped next door to starbucks instead rooms were a little tired especially the paintwork on the bathroom door but that was all i could fault really all in all a good hotel surrounded with lots of great restaurants the columbus circle shops and cenral park on your;4
spacious lobby topnotch security very gracious staff i liked that you had to show room key to get access to elevators room was tastefully appointed closet outstanding bar in the basement nice location walkable to either penn station or hudson yards;4
celebrating our anniversary turned out to be a scorching heat wave in nyc but andrea in the lobby bar was a pleasure from the first day relatable and easy to make you feel welcome friendly professional and makes a great drink too;4
i am partially sighted barry was ever so helpful to overcome my obstacles my only problem was the hotel room is very dark and that it was very hard for myself as a partially sighted person to identify dark objects in this environment for example furniture;4
we booked our standard leisure room online and were originally assigned an unwelcoming room on the second floor the ac had not been turned on 82 degree day the room was hot and noisy and i couldnt immediately find the ac controls i returned to the front desk and was reassigned a room on a higher floor ac was on room was fresh and larger many thanks to pasquale for being so very kind and attentive to a hot and tired traveler;4
the queen room was cosy but how much time do you spend there the important thing is location right across from lincoln center where our group was attending several operas it was not fancy but more than adequate and a good choice for our group;4
we stayed at this hotel for four nights and had a great time the hotel is quite dated and the lobby always crowded with random people which was a little off putting we also found our room to be small with very limited storage however our bed was comfy we had a great shower and the location was perfect for us making our stay in new york a memorable one all the staff were friendly and efficient particularly mohammed who checked us in and the gentleman on the transportation desk who was extremely helpful we would return;4
it was our second time staying at the property you cant beat the location if you are going to universal studios which was our destination for both visits i hear there is a shuttle but to be honest the walk over the pedestrian bridge right to the gates is less than 5 minutes so we never needed it location location location the front desk and staff i encountered are friendly but not extremely informative as far as parking breakfast etc i had to ask about breakfast and how the parking worked it is awesome that you can leave your car until 6pm the day you checkout so you can stay in the park without moving your vehicle the rooms are good size and the beds are comfy the first stay we got upgraded to a universal view but the second room had a great view as;4
i was a bit apprehensive booking this hotel based on some of the negative reviews but had a very positive experience overall we arrived four hours before the actual checkin time but needed the room asap in order to get ready for a 5pm commencement ceremony nicole the young woman at the front desk told us that she would do everything in her power to get the room ready she called us less than an hour later while we were having brunch at bar boulud which is conveniently located a block away to inform us that our room was ready its a great location if you are attending a graduation at columbia you take the subway line six stops up and youre there in less than 15 minutes lincoln center is right across the street and there are several fabulous restaurants in the;4
we stayed here for a few nights as a stop over on the way back from london the service was average but the rooms were great big and clean the location was ok there were some weird people around so i wouldnt feel safe going on the subway at night the subway was clean cheap and quick and would recommend using this to get around the breakfasts were amazing with big waffels would be a great place to stay if you hired a car as you cant walk anywhere and the buses werent that great as they were very full overall we enjoyed our stay here;4
on sunday evening we had tickets to a show at madison square garden were only a 45 min train ride into nyc but the weather forecast was for snow ice frigid temps thought it would be a great idea to stay overnight family members agreed i wanted the closest hotel to penn station msg which would have reasonable rates as well as clean rooms etc went online for prices couldnt believe how low the pricing was especially for a city hotel i read enough reviews to reserve 2 rooms well our experience was very pleasant checkin line went quickly as they had five people behind the desk everyone was super nice they had accommodated my request prior to checking in to having our rooms situated in near proximity our rooms were totally refurbished with new mattresses;4
stayed at the jane for 4 nights in march 2015 and we really loved it yes the rooms are tiny if you are very tall of a larger frame you may be better upgrading but the lobby staff were willing to take one of our suitcases into storage and this gave a bit more space we found our room to be clean and the space is quite clever staff were friendly and helpful the only small issue was that after our return from the theatre we were stopped from entering the hotel by the nightclub bouncers as we did not meet the dress code for the club this was quickly rectified we never saw anyone else in the bathroom which was always clean we would recommend this hotel to some of our friends who we think would like the experience but not to others my mum would hate it we are saving now;4
this hotel was great clean and close to all the attractions red line metro is located two blocks away you can park for 25 a day complementary breakfast is really good eggs are made fresh per order the cooks name is hugo very nice guy;4
it has been said that everywhere in la takes 20 minutes and this is true for this hotel it is quite central and its easy to get everywhere you need to with a car parking prices are a bit of a drag but its la after all we stayed here for a week and a half and the hotel was very accommodating to us and met all our needs housekeeping it a bit funny with cleaning times but its a clean place with good facilities the breakfast is good too;4
the hotel is conveniently located near penn station its less than a 5 minute walk mohamed offered excellent customer service and allowed us to do an early check in our room had a beautiful view the room was small but we just needed somewhere to shower and sleep after doing a day trip room was clean and checkout was quick i would highly recommend;4
i stayed in room 516 from march 12th until the 14th 2010 single female 27 traveler it was a very cool hotel lots of character and history in the building cafe gitane was super handy for snacks and breakfasts the staff were excellent from the front desk to elevator operator to cafe staff they were all extremely helpful and very nice housekeeping changes the sheets they supply you with two towels a bottle of water two glasses a bathrobe and flipflops i thought that was a nice touch the room was super tiny but for what i paid i didnt really expect it to be big shared bathrooms but they were very clean but were never busy location was amazing i loved staying in chelseawest village it was a quick walk to get cabs cool restaurants cafes shops and;4
have just returned from staying at the empire for 14 nights fantastic location near central park near great places to eat near subway near lincoln center and near some good shops we found the hotels staff very satisfactory hotel was kept very clean but rather on the dark side dark furnishings and decoration not exactly light and airy our room was a good size and clean the only down side to the room was the noisy air conditioning unit 247 noisy even when turned off if we return to new york would stay here again;4
location is wonderfuleasy access everywhere rooms are fine nothing special water pressure great tv reception and quality excellent asked for someone to come look at my door lock nobody ever came up sounds trivial but the guys at the front entrance were friendly and fantastic and helpful housekeeping was good but did not always replace same number of towels all in all good hotel but not outstanding;4
fantastic area of town near meatpacking great restaurants and shops not too touristy and a beautiful bar the bar is beautiful with antiques and character gets lively after 9 we stayed in a room facing the west side highway with a queen bed not cheap but a good local not too touristy experience;4
it took me quite a while to write a review on this very beautiful place i had to think things over as the overall service and the building deserves a top rating however there were some very minor setbacks which would total the score at 998 not a full 10 in the end i decided to be consistent with my general approach and only give five stars to a flawless experience although this one really got very close to absolute perfection the location is great a little on the outskirts of the medina and yet quite a pleasant walk thru the suq into the very center of marrakesh this old riad comprises three different buildings all beautifully restored and a magnificent terrace where you can simply lie down in a sofa or have breakfast overlooking the roofs of the city the staff is;4
despite what some of the negative reviewers say this place is pretty nice yes its not the ritzcarlton but its not a cheap sleazy place also my husband and i stayed for 7 nights we found it pleasant i do have some things i didnt like but not enough for me to hate or not like the place the staff there are warm and inviting anna who helped us at the front desk was patient and kind the cleaning staff were amazing and made sure our stay was comfortable the hotel isnt far from the vermontsanta monica metro stop which is a plus as for the area please dont judge a book by its cover my husband and i went to the rite aide down the block from the hotel a few times we even ventured to the nearest bank of america up the road the locals were nice and helpful;4
unfortunately the reservation system for checkin was down so they couldnt issue any room keys the result spending 4560 minutes in line to checkin only to find out you cant get a room key had to fillout a sheet of paper with info and they write down the time and say they will call you in the order that people checked in sat around for 15 hours checked the expected time for me as i saw people showing up after getting the phone call that checked in around the time i did they said they were working close to my time i had a broadway show to get to so had to leave at the show never receiving a phone call about my room i called during intermission finally getting through to front desk and was told yes the system is working and i can get my room key;4
the hotel was the perfect location for going to an event at lincoln center and columbus circle area most people tend to stay midtown it down this is a great hotel to stay so you venture and see what you have been missing;4
room was large and comfortable facing the nice central courtyard could see the hollywood sign on tip toes a nice sized roof terrace off third floor give good views towards the down town skyscrapers breakfast buffet included fresh made eggs or pancakes but suggest avoid the turkey sausages and the hash browns only a block away from the metro with connections to hollywood boulevard and downtown union station;4
this is the fourth time weve stayed here as we like the location near to the park handy for our early morning runs around the resevoir and the bars and restaurants on broadway and amsterdam ave about 10 mins walk away its clean comfortable even if the rooms are small our room on this occassion was a little bit disappointing as we did request a room over looking the park as weve never had one before but we just had a brick wall as usual tv was mainly snow shower was more tap than shower and we had a problem with the smoke alarm which kept beeping and took three requests to get fixed and then them messing our taxi times up however we didnt spend much time in the room and would stay here again;4
great location nice rooms and excellent service the pool is fun and is great place to wind down with a drink after a long day of sight seeing the breakfast buffet was also excellent i would also add that the parking lot attendants were extremely courteous and delivered our car to us very quickly overall our stay was excellent;4
one the whole this is a very good hotel we booked this because of his proximity to unerversal studios walkable free shuttle bus good sized clean rooms comfortable beds very nice pool with lots of sunbeds and facilitiesthe staff were very friendly no resort fee is charged but there was a higher than adverage charge for parking and internet access;4
hubby and i scored this hotel at a reasonable cost on a sharing site the front desk staff were warm and welcoming we had a room with a view of broadwayif you fancy people watching it was perfect for that however i now understand why they provided ear plugs as the noise from the streets was unbearable well its nyc ive stayed elsewhere in the city and was unaffected by noise decor was nice room and bedroom had ample space bed was very comfy and had additional pillows crowd at the hotel seemed more european and olderso the lobby bar was not boomingjust saying mini bar stocked nicely too for us the location was perfect it was central enough to walk and uber;4
easy to get to by car and there is a self parking available if you dont want to pay for valet parking very friendly and helpful staff as expected at hilton the room was outstanding clean of course but it was spacious and we got a great view the pool area was nice and good tempered the jacuzzi felt great after a hard day at universal studios a free shuttle bus takes you to the universal city area where you find a lot of restaurants and shops as a hilton honours member complimentary continental breakfast is included and you can upgrade to the buffet for a small cost free wifi for one hour is also included if youre a member a little bit cheap in my opinion we had the dinner buffet which i would not have undone pricey but you find things youve never tasted;4
this was our second stay at the empire hotel and we plan to return againwe enjoyed our stay with one exception which was discussed earlier in this survey the staff is wonderful and we even received a complimentary upgrade upon our arrival a very nice surprise it made us feel very special;4
i had a great one night stay here in december 2012 the room was small but definitely suited our needs the beddingfloorsbathroom were clean the staff was friendly the location for the price could not be beat 3 blocks from a subway station across the street from central park great 24 hour deli down the street the only issue i had was the outlet power some of the sockets did not work had to do a little rearranging to get my phone to charge room did run very warm at night but the air conditioner provided offset that problem just fyi no refrigerator;4
i love staying at the jane hotel when im in nyc traveling solo it is a great concept hotel which makes me feel like being back in college tiny but cozy rooms shared yet clean bathrooms the west village location is wonderful the rates are extremely appealing my only advise is to bring earplugs for the night the doors slam noisily and there are many doors on each floor;4
this hotel is near a number of iconic attractions in addition to universal studios it is very close to hollywood and the walk of famethe bellmen staff at the concierge desk and front desk were always helpful the pool was attractive and the service there was good we stayed in two different rooms and both were well maintained the elevators were under construction when we were there but a lot of effort was made to ease the congestion that resulted from that the hotel is expensive as is the food service but a lot of effort is made to give value for the money we enjoyed the free apples at the front desk and the water with lemon nearby;4
i stayed at this hotel for 15 days and was very happy with my room the crew and the location i had a good price a really nice hotel i would definately stay there again and recommend it i did not have a car and could easily use metro really close and bus and uber and got everywhere;4
i think ones feelings about this hotel will be related to the rate they pay i was here for the nyc triathlon which wa just before the 4th of july and paid stay rates were 330 per night fortunately i had wyndham points to cash in because no way was this hotel worth that by contrast i weent across the river to brooklyn 20 minutes by metro for the next 3 nights and paid 84 per night though not as good i would not say only 25 as good maybe 7580 so again depends on the rate so i will give my pluses and minues from here and you can decide if these are helpful location but almost anywhere in manhattan is depending on why you are there here you are by madison square garden penn station with very short walk to time square rockefeller center in one direction;4
the hotel is beautiful checkin was quick and they held our bags for 5each while we strolled the city our room was smaller than pictured but very clean and modern beautiful view of the city we took panoramic pictures from the 33rd floor multiple times during our stay the staff was quick to assist when we didnt get the fridge we requested in the room water pressure was fantastic in the bathroom and i love the bumble bumble toiletries the beds and linens were also very comfortable and you could hardly hear the noise of the city outside we will be back next year;4
we stayed here for three nights while in ny for a billy joel concert at madison square garden the property needs updating but our room was comfortable the staff was excellent the price was reasonable and security was great always someone on duty checking room keys before you could get into the elevator this hotel was built in the 1930s and a good deal of the charm remains the location cant be beat kittycorner from msgpenn station and within walking distance of times square empire state building and if youre game rockefeller center lots of decent restaurants and bars nearby check out the bar in the basement occupying a space once used by a bank you can even get a table in the vault the service there was excellent as with checkin cleaning staff etc;4
close to nearby parks eateries bars gyms joggingbike paths shopping and museums galore you can manage to squeeze in a lot during your visit of the city great to bring your family during your business trip so much to see and do;4
this is a good hotel to stay at when you cant afford anything else closer to midtown i even found parking on the same street since there is alot of residence there i just had to make sure it wasnt street cleaning time there are plenty of garage for parking around but i didnt have to pay for it since my timing was good with the street cleaning the hotel itself is old but its clean everything was working and clean just dont look under the bed because i found a mouse trap it didnt give me a good feeling after i saw it but i did see it on my last day therebesides i rather see a mouse trap than a mouse itself which there was no signs of they first gave me a smoking room by accident which is located out in the hallsthe smell was just aweful so i quickly;4
when we arrive on the first night the heat was not working and the room was very cold corner room broadway and 54st i had to report it 3 times before the person at the front desk could only give blankets and not solve the problem until the next day the next day adam chief of engineering came to the room and apologize for the inconvenient he was very friendly and willing to help he fix the ac in seconds and offered us free wifi or breakfast we choose breakfast id like to report a lack of willing to help to the front desk staff but adam was great great service attitude and willing to compensate the bad experience;4
everyone employed there was very helpful friendly and professional got a corner room on the 25 th floor and the view was amazing did not eat at the 24 hour restaurant but their desert case appeared to be top notch i would definitely stay here again;4
i go to nyc 12x year have a few favorite hotels but my sil was joining me and she liked this hotel so tried it really liked the location kind of iconic old hotel near penn station the room was small but we are in nyc my sil had great view mine not so much but i never worry as i wasnt in the room except to sleep the lobby was always a great place to take a break and being so central to where we were going on this trip we could pop in out during the day the staff were all very nice good security as you had to show room key to get to elevator banks in the hotel had a nice wine at the bar and ate breakfast at tic toc diner connected to hotel would definitely recommend this hotel if you are coming to nyc for some shows and the classic tourist stops;4
this was our second stay at the new yorker again in a suite for two adults and two teenagers this is a great option this suite was larger than the one we previously stayed in it was on the 34th floor with amazing views over nyc and the empire state building the suite 3420 has a large square hallway with walk in wardrobecupboard lounge large bathroom and large bedroom with two double beds my motherinlaw and fatherinlaw also stayed at the hotel but their room being a double was much smaller the location is fabulous for seeing all the main attractions and staff were friendly and helpful as usual a complimentary birthday cake was sent to our room for my sonsâ birthday during our stay which was a nice touch our visit coincided with the elections and;4
a very comfortable and friendly place to stay while in new york city good location lincoln center across the street rooftop bar on the 12th floor would stay there again if visiting on the west side;4
the hotel is in an excellent location a 5 minute walk from universal studios we received complimentary water on check in because of hilton honors membership which was nice room was on the 20th floor with a great view of universal studios beds were comfortable and room clean for the most part a little dust here and there breakfast buffet had a reasonable range of options staff were professional and courteous overall an enjoyable stay;4
we enjoyed our stay room was clean and staff accommodating stones throw from msg as we were there to see billy joel would use again if in the neighborhood they also allowed us late check out which was convenient;4
great location room was great value excellent i would stay there again i stayed for location to mt sinai hospital and it was just a short cab ride away the price was so reasonable consider the location;4
booked directly through hilton honors hh now most hotels checkin by 300 pm but we were to be guaranteed a 400 pm checkin through the hh program we had requested an earlier checkin of 230 pm but la traffic messes with garmins etas and we arrive about 340 pm waited through the line and was told the room was not ready waited through the line again and by 400 pm the room was still not ready i complained and were comped with breakfast buffet 56 value so that made that feel a bit better still we were tired and would have better liked to just go to our room rest and go to universal room was beautiful clean and on the fourth floor which has the advantage of also being the mezzanine which contains conference rooms and a second set of elevators that;4
this hostel is really great stayed here in 2006 for 6 months and came back in 2008 to stay here again for 2 weeks im a student and you will meet international friends here before you know it too play pool one of the many bars in the hostels area i know i will stay here in future again staff is unbelievable keep up the good work guys albert netherlands;4
we booked our stay as a package deal with universal express tickets and we loved the convenience to the park only takes minutes to be inside walking the best part of this hotel was the amazing staff they were all so pleasant and helpful we were even able to attend the monthly hiltonâs honors reception and had a really lovely time the only items that caused me to not give a full 5stars is the fact our rooms bathroom door was incredibly squeaky and that in order to checkin early we were charged a 25 fee also we were told that because we booked through the universal site as a package our hilton honors account couldnât be added that was a big disappointment overall great clean hotel for the proximity and great dtaff the staff makes this hotel;4
good place to stay near central park from reading other reviews here i think we had an excellent room which was a complimentary upgrade from the standard double i had booked thank you don we had a 3rd floor corner room which was surprisingly large for ny with a view of lincoln center we booked the splash package on their website which gave us 2 drinks in the bar and 2 breakfasts for about 30 more a good deal for this area the downsides were that it took me 3 trips to the front desk to obtain all the vouchers necessary for this package and that the air conditioning in the room had a hard time keeping up with the 90 degree heat had it going full blast the entire time temperature was just tolerable;4
very good property great service nice rooms need some updating book a corner king suite with a view parking is expensive location location location across the street from universal studios gives plenty to do and lots of dining choices very convenient to lots of la hot spots and businesses;4
this is my goto hotel while it can be crowded at the lobby at times nothing beats being next to lincoln center columbus circle central park and so much more last week i stayed there for work 3 nights and the fourth time in four years nothing is perfect and what made this stay special was the service from the housekeeping department 8th floor and rasheed from security you see after i checked out i remembered that i had not emptied the safe i returned after one hour and rasheed had already retrieved my things things of great value literally silly me for not taking them out therefore it is not about the number of stars it is about the experience especially when things go wrong rasheed was there thank you so much rasheed;4
my daughter and i stayed at the ameritania for 4 nights and had a wonderful stay the hotel is not big or fancy but very stylish and clean the rooms were compact but very well appointed with a great shower for being in such a central location the rooms were very quiet i come to new york regularly and this was one of the best value hotels i have stayed at in the past 5 years the staff was helpful especially julian who helped us get a car to lga we had a problem with the toilet the first night and someone came up to fix it immediately;4
very good hotel in new york terrible room service expensive very poor quality of food no mention on the room menu the extrasservices payment and the automatic 18 tip charge strongly not recommend;4
we stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our holiday prior to flying back to australia we found the location to be very convenient we caught the free shuttle bus to the hotel from the airport and back to the airport on our departure we booked a king bed room with club access which was handy for breakfast and pre dinner snacks the gym is well equipped and has a great view of the airport the outdoor heated pool is huge and we enjoyed having the opportunity for a swim we got an uber to the citadel outlet shopping centre on our free day for some retail therapy and a change of scenery we were able to purchase a late checkout to 6pm for a reasonable cost which worked out well with our night flight back to australia;4
lovely hotel in a fantastic locationclose to everything but far enough out to not always be in the hustle and bustle of the city mr ze welcomed us to the hotel and was very polite and answered all of our questions about the hotel and the previous bad weather rooms are very nice but a few minor things let it down cosmetically but is a great base as mentioned before on another review the room was way too hot;4
the staff greeted me as if we were family the entire time we were there the staff was always kind and respectful upon returning to my room i found that the housekeeper eloise i believe her name is found a vase to put my birthday flowers we enjoyed our entire stay next time we stay we hope to use the exercise equipment the location was great we walked to the movie theater rode the subway which was minutes away from our hotel a variety of good restaurants and starbucks on almost every corner the only downfall was that the shuttle we thought would be faster than a cab left the hotel at 150 pm arrived at the airport at 345pm we still made our flight but if we had known we would have just caught a cab;4
excellent location near penn station the room was very comfortable so are the beds it is an art deco building if i am not wrong the room and bathroom still have an old charm the view from the room was stunning at the 31st floor would come back and recommend;4
we chose this hotel because the price was right and ended up being pleasantly surprised our room was spacious and clean the courtyard is adorable the staff was really friendly and a wonderful breakfast is included in the room rate the location isnt really that great but a metro stop is super close so that wasnt an issue at all i would definitely recommend to others if you dont mind using public transportation;4
so much to love about this hotel and the close proximity to universal studios however im embarrassed that my first comments are complaints about the cost of parking and the buffet parking we were enjoying a summer drive between sf and la therefore we had our car that needed to be parked 28day is much too expensive especially considering that the lot was not full and that im a hilton honors member that usually enjoys reduced rate for parking i asked for a reduced rate but no such luck breakfast buffet so much potential but you must pass a barrage of questions as if they are afraid that a few unsuspecting guests may actually not pay full price and speaking of price the high cost of the buffet is not commensurate with the value ive paid less and ive;4
i was very pleased over all with my stay at the empire hotel the location was great and i got a really good price for the room the staff was pleasant and helpful i needed an iron and ironing board and ordered room service in the morning and both were brought very promptly my only complaint was about noise my room was right at the elevator and i heard noises until the wee hours and again early in the morning plus there was construction outside of my window that started early on monday morning but of course thats not the hotels fault there were a lot of items for sale and that was nice except they were very expensive i dropped my toothbrush on the bathroom floor and had to purchase the 17 smile kit there also was a 38 intimacy kit out in the open that anyone;4
we have stayed many times at this hotel due to its proximity to universal studios hollywood we have fond memories and of course varying experiences they are currently remodeling and so a few things were amiss the most annoying and inconvenient was a whistling noise that i could only assume was created by the ac and some leak of air to the outside it sounded like a kid playing a flutophone;4
we stayed here for 4 nights in july 2017 upon arrival on nth vermont ave we were searching for the hotel in the picture turns out the photo shown is actually at the back of the hotel spacious room comfy bed very tidy limited utensils in the kitchen no seats on the balcony but a view looking up to griffith observatory amazing buffet breakfast and friendly staff the pool area is great and they supply fresh towels there are lots of lounge chairs in the pool area the hotel is located close to the metro which was a big pro but aside from that the area has a dodgy feel and isnt close to much else we would have given it 5 stars but we felt it was quite expensive for what it was and the location;4
although they provide a shuttle bus its just as quick to walk as you are right by the entrance rooms were plenty big enough for 4 of us as with most chains extras were very expensive so breakfast wifi were the most we have paid on our trip;4
we needed a hotel near our daughters west side apartment the empire fit the bill close reasonably priced and a great restaurant on premises amenities were ok though the shampoo and shower gel containers could be larger and really wifi in every room not just lounge not unrealistic but the price was right rooms were clean checkin easy and nearby amenities accessible;4
excellent location very welcoming efficient staff very pleasant decor delicious inhotel restaurants with very good service and excellent food room pleasant and only problem was window caulking missing so cold air came pouring in also city noise;4
a very strong nautical theme to this hotel tiny cabins and shared bathroomsshowers but beautifully finished i stayed on business and the location and price were unrivalled there is an excellent restaurant on site and in the morning you can be up and running the highline in 5 minutes a superb way to start the day;4
nice location not far from downtown los angeles secure parking with a guard parking is 20 but worth it for the peace of mind continental breakfast was good they opened a bit early which was convenient for me plenty of open seating room and i liked the selection easy to get to from the hollywood and the santa monica freeways easy half mile walk to the la subway which can take you to either downtown or universal city many travelers were using that to go to universal staff was very friendly and knowledgable of how to get around;4
my decision to stay here was based on the location near the subway line a ride away from midtown i enjoyed walking broadway and riverside park last time i stayed in queens and it was long ride in the subway you are paying to stay in a safe neighborhood blocks away from columbia university i really cant say much for the amenities of the room when you have the city so close it was a convenient and cheap place to crash thats it patrick the manager was helpful and friendly finding a car service to the airport i be coming back;4
stayed for 2 nights prior to a transatlantic cruise that left out of brooklyn we chose this hotel as i had some wyndham points transferred points from caesarsharrahs casino and it was a great location we arrived early since we had a redeye flight into jfk when trying to checkin we were advised nothing was available but they could store the luggage mohammad at the desk was extremely professional and caring since we had not slept we really were not in the mood to walk around the city yet so we just camped out in the lobby for awhile with a little nourishment from mcds across the street after a couple hours a room became available security is very good at this hotel as you have to show key to get towards elevator in lobby i liked the building as it has alot of;4
the empire is a nyc icon a great location walking distance to central park the moma etc my only complaint is that the rooms and bathrooms are very small we had 4 people in a two bed double and were cramped fortunately no one really goes to nyc to sit in their hotel room the rooftop is awesome with great views and the staff were friendly and helpful would definitely stay here again;4
firstly the location is excellent around 7 mins walk to central park and 25 mins walk away from times square there are subways close by at columbus circle on 59th south and on 66th street north the hotel lobby is impressive with a contemporary vibe and is atmospherically lit the bar area is extended to a mezzanine just up a open staircase the staff are warm and welcoming sadly the double room we had was not of the same standard overall the room was very clean the bed was comfortable with good linen however it was tired and the bathroom was much in need of some tlc the room had no view and overlooked every other rooms dated airconditioning units theses were increadabilly loud and did disturb my sleep i would consider staying again but would insist on a room that was;4
this was my first trip to new york city and i couldnt have been happier with the empire hotel my friend and i were here for 4 nights the room was cozy but we didnt spend much time there except for sleeping great view overlooking broadway and lincoln center comfortable beds and great maid service the concierge and doormen were friendly and helpful the rooftop nightclub was a hit with great service there as well overall an awesome experience and a good deal;4
we had a great check in with friendly staff room was comfortable and had frig tv was large and decor was nice and updated i love being close to the airport and not being able to hear the airplanes also loved the cylinders with lights out the window so fun to watch we had a drink at the bar and the staff there was wonderful very accommodating and friendly it was a great stay but there was an extra charge for 119 for breakfast on my invoice yikes i am still waiting for it to be rectified so be careful and watch your charges;4
excellent service from ms cecile eugenio at the front desk who was bent backwards to make our stay as pleasant as possible;4
this hotel was one of the most well put together hotels ive stayed at from the rooms to the rooftop bar to the lobby everything was classy and elegant the price was great for a hotel in manhattan and the location is close to the park and the subway staff was friendly and quick we had no trouble checking in or out the room was decently sized and super clean we had no problems at all with this hotel and are looking forward to staying there again when we return to new york;4
perfect location for two days at universal studios easy walk to park and citywalk good sized comfortable rooms clean modern hotel and nice pool area its an older hilton and could use a renovation update but for the good value of price and location not complaining;4
hotel empire is a nice hotel with a fantastic location easy to get to everything 10 to get a taxi to hell kitchen 5 min walk to central park starbucks a pharmacy and store in the same block so its great for sight seeing early morning starts and also great to start nights out they have a brilliant late night roof top bar but the problem with it is if ur on the top floors you wont get any sleep at all they should think about a sound proofing them floors they need to finish decorating and fixing up some little broken and unfinished bits here and there as well the staff are friendly and will help in anyway they can unless its there mistake and they will blame you or your travel agent;4
great stay at this hotel the rooms are a bit dated but very clean as is the whole hotel there are some seating areas in the lobby and there is security in the hotel the hotel is across the road from maddison square gardens and only a few minutes walk to the empire state building and macyâs would definitely visit again;4

amidst the pandemic i needed a hotel to stay until i could return home this hotel was well poised wrt location so i booked it the hotel amenities and covid protocols were very good i could see persons cleaning in the lobby all the time mandatory temperature checks and hand sanitizer on every floor however when when i had questions about reservations neida was the person she made me feel very comfortable when i had question about literally anything she always had the time to discuss any issues i had and always a person to her word meeting a person like here during this unusual time we are in was very welcoming i would highly recommend this hotel great location and staff;4

would definitely stay in this hotel again and recommend it to friends nice hotel good check in time nice staff large rooms comfortable rooms great free breakfast hotel was well kept and clean good pool but not too many loungers so need to be there early pizza hut and a noodle bar close by and a few restaurants within walking distance close to 2 metro stations 5 and 8 min walk and 34 stops from hollywood 175 each way or 7 for day pass after purchasing card at 1 would stay here again but would try to get hotel closer to hollywood boulevard first;4
while i didnt use the hotel for traditional hotel services the staff is very friendly and helping nice bar area for viewing sporting events the hotel is right on the grounds of universal hollywood very nice views and outside seating areasas well as pool area;4
love this hotel and the location the staff are super friendly and efficient as well the rooms are a little tired and the could use a little more lighting but overall great hotel the rooms with views are great but rooms in the back overlooking vents are subpar you cannot beat location;4
to be quite honest i was not in my room much at all the standard room is small but was enough room to sleep the shared restroom at the end was no problem at all let the water run for about five minutes so you have hot water now for the great parts staff was incredible helpful and always professional the restaurant has good food and a great staff and the bar downstairs and rooftop were very nice with a bit of a crowd on wednesday and thursday hotel is close to subway and local bars and the staff once again was very helpful overall a great experience if you need a comfortable place for a great price please pick the jane new york city;4
this was our second time staying at this hotel during the westminster dog show week the hotel offers shuttle buses to the piers for breed judging and is right across the street from msg for the group judging and bis so it works out well for exhibitors it isnt the glitziest hotel but its clean and well run both the diner and the trattoria serve great food most importantly the staff are phenomenal kudos especially to joe the valet who in addition to giving us terrific service really took an interest in us and our dog it made our trip to new york all that much more enjoyable;4
we stayed here for one night in may 2016 we had a view of the swimming pool and we were on the first floor of the hotel so no elevators needed to be taken to go to our room the room was spacious and clean the bathroom was spacious as well and its good to give a toddler a bath we were able to get breakfast the next day and the selections were good there are two options continental breakfast or you can pay another fee for an upgrade in which you get the continental plus hot food like eggs meat etc i thought the continental was good enough it had muffins fruits yogurts cereal oatmeals smoked salmon ham turkey and variety of cheese and the breakfast includes drinks the location of this hotel is great youre walking distance from the city walk and universal;4
beautiful historic hotel in a a great location across from madison square gardens and very close walking distance to broadway theatres and times square our room had a great view of the empire state building and a nice art deco charm would definitely stay here again;4
we just returned from a week at the empire hotel we found the staff to be exceedingly friendly and our room was great with a lovely view of the lincoln centre we had the cold buffet each morning and found it to be good value lots of great restaurants just outside the front door for evening an easy 30 minute walk totheatres and time square we travel often in europe and the empire has the same feel as some of the comfortable hotels we stay at there dont expect a huge room or bath but both are comfortable well appointed and cleanelevators were a frustration but we had been warned about this problem my suggestion is to get a room on one of the lower floors so you can use the stairs while they are under renovation my personal thanks to the manager john s for responding;4
my friend and i stayed at the astor on the park in november 2014 we got in at 5pm and there were no issues checking in the consierge was kind enough to show us how to use the shower seems as thought some people didnt know how the elevator is a little small and would probably fit 2 people plus 2 pieces of luggage max the room was simple 2 double beds small window facing a wall which didnt matter to us water pressure was great hot water in abundance and the room was clean the only thing that was a little annoying was that the alarm clock was plugged into the wall which was linked to the main lightswitch so when we turned off the light the alarm would shut off making it difficult to set the alarm however we had our phones which was good enough overall i;4
the suite was nice and clean the location very convenient to shopping theater and restaurants the staff was friendly and efficient;4
celebrating my daughters 18th bday in nyc the empire hotel was our first stop on our gossip girl themed adventure the decor throughout the hotel and rooms are wonderful the rooftop bar atmosphere was pretty awesome but i did not get a chance to enjoy it since i was there to celebrate by daughters 18th bday with that being said i will return to ensure i enjoy all that the empire has to offer;4
this is the closest hotel to universal studios just steps away rooms are upscale clean comfortable breakfast prices are outrageous its far better to enter the parks and eat breakfast there fyi our room had a fridge but no microwave room cost less than i expected under 200 considering the proximity to universal studios overall very good value;4
i enjoyed staying in a clean newly appointed room in this centrally located art deco hotel subway very nearby as well as major attractions decent exercise room 3 good restaurants attached to the lobby depending on the types of meals you are looking for;4
really lovely hotel clean rooms nice and modern amazing bathroom the shower was huge the staff were super helpful and kind the pool was nice although a little cold but was fine once you were in and the sun beds were great really comfy with towels provided the back of the hotel is where the fountain is and that is beautiful shame you only see it if you go to the parking lot or the pool location isnt ideal we had to get ubers or the train everywhere but it is right across the street from a subway which is really useful and easy and cheap;4
we had three great nights at the hilton rooms were large and very clean and the service was great we had two rooms for our family of five and we were able to organise a 7pm check out which was great shuttle service to city walk was an added bonus would definitely recommend this hotel;4
great location close to subway and time square they had great customer service our room was modern and clean but tiny i mean like we walk in the door and we had to squeeze in beside the bed so we could close the door and get to the rest of the room our bathroom door stuck a little which caused a little panic about how i would be able to get out the concierge was helpful with how to get around town and with getting us same day tickets to see cats at a reasonable rate the in house restaurant was efficient and tasty;4
fun vibe friendly staff great place to stay especially if you need or want to be by lincoln center;4
we didnt go to universal studios but went to burbank wb tour city walk and walk of fame area this was the perfect location for a 3 night stay we only took our car out 1 time we walked or took metro the other times we booked standard king room but im not sure how maybe being a hhonors member we had a 20th floor out of 22 floors huge alcove executive room we had a fruit platter with bottled water waiting in our room and received vouchers for breakfast and appetizers what a wonderful unexpected surprise i will say the staff isnt the friendliest front desk concierge breakfast staff or the happiest other than jill in the atrium lounge shes great but for the upgrades location nice clean hotel wed come back if were in the universal city area;4
had a interesting ride from jfk in minibus last on coach to be dropped off traffic nightmare but saw quite a bit of the surrounding area hotel has a lot off character we are on 28 floor lift look old but the workings must be new as they are quick the room are small but fine for us bath small but original fixtures if your over 510 take a shower prices for basics are exspecive so take note we paid 2 dollars for a small czn of coke not the normal uk size beds comfortable can hear some noise from next door rooms and the tv was rubbish but that was no major issue 3 dont drink water from hotel placed in rooms as you can see quite expensiveapart from these moans a must visit at some time and dont forget walking shoes;4
great view straight on to the empire state building as well as the chrysler building madison square garden and downtown towards 1 world trade and the statue of liberty balcony terrace was a bit neglected but the views were fabulous day or night even in the rain wonderful art deco features throughout 24 hour tick tock diner trattoria restaurant and in the basement butcher and banker restaurant where you can dine in an old bank vault are all attached to the hotel my 1 criticism is the additional fees for phone fitness centre business centre and wifi which is compulsory i didnt use any except the wifi which wasnt very responsive anyway so felt ripped off by this if its compulsory include it in the booking price even budget hotels in the uk provide free internet;4
was looking for a cheap hotel in a good location for a weekend trip to nyc travelled during marathon weekend so i found a great deal with the jane hotel arrived at 10am and quickly checked into our bunkbed room the room was insanely tiny but for two girls and our carryon suitcases it suited us just fine i would not try to bring in full sized suitcases as i have no idea where you would even open them as there is next to no room to do so i loved the fact that they have awesome free bottles of water and the individual flat screen tvs on each bunk the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful and the bellman was so adorable always holding the door open for us and wishing us a great day we ate one breakfast in the cafe it was yummy but the service was;4
good service clean rooms friendly staff decent gym i would recommend this hotel if youre planning at trip to la i stayed in the tower floor executive king and when i arrived in the room a fruit basket was waiting for me in my room the room also came with continental breakfast with pastries fruit and yogurt a solid meal to get you going in the morning distance wise its a little ways from the downtown area but you need a car in la anyways and its right next to 101 and universal studios plus theres an in and out right down the street;4
we stayed 3 nights here at the start of a two week trip from the uk and loved this hotel we had a room on the 16th floor with huge windows and views over universal studios and the mountains so for that alone it was perfect the king size bed was supremely comfortable as were the pillows i had brought my own pillow from the uk as i am very fussy but didnt need it as the ones in the room were fabulous we had booked this hotel naturally as it is adjacent to universal studios and because we are british and used to walking everywhere we scoffed at the shuttle and walked fab views but on our last day we did use it and found it very handy still being on uk time we were awake in the middle of the night and used room service which was very prompt we also used the bar;4
yes rooms are not very big but they do the job bed very comfy clean room adequate bathroom for the price very good you get what you pay for asked for coffee maker in room no problem this was a shopping trip for christmas very central easy access to shopping times square etc i have visited quite a few times so know what i want this was a return visit to this hotel it is so central and good value for the money at this time of the year as a brit and the pound being terrible vs the us at the moment it was expensive eating out but overall shopping very competitive one tip if you want to see a show i dont prebook i pop into theatre and ask what they have we got tickets to see the show of choice 6th row from the front of stage at a knocked down price;4
this hotel ticks all the boxes for location close to greenwich village the highline old disused elevated trainwalkway and the subway isnt far either it has great views of the hudson and there are some lovely affordable cafes and bars around the area it is also close to the financial wtcs too i stayed in a bunkroom and as other reviews suggest they are indeed small the same size as an amtrak us or mk3 sleeper uk on a train however they are beautifully clean and i slept very well lcd tv on each bunk powerpoints radiator a window that opens and shelving to store small items the bathrooms are shared but over the two nights i stayed i only saw another person once whilst cleaning my teeth before bed showers are very roomy and very clean and the;4

i enjoyed my twonight stay this past weekend the rooms were clean and comfortable and surprisingly modern although they were tiny and the walls were a bit thin you cant beat the price for the locationwalking out to central park in the morning for a run and being two blocks from a subway stop were major pluses;4
the hotel is nice room is clean at a great neighborhood drug store steps away is very handy the restaurant is also great good food reasonably priced for the area the only thing not so great is the bathroom first of all the bathroom door cannot swing completely open because there isnt enough gap between the floor and the door its not a problem for single person use but its a bit problematic when you try to help a kid in the bathroom theres no exhaust fan in the bathroom the main problem is the shower theres a nice rain shower head and also hand held shower both very powerful unfortunately theres no shower door or even a shower curtain half of the shower has a glass wall and the other half is wide open with a little curb at the bottom no matter how hard;4
hotel is well located to the west sidelincoln center and restaurants funky atmosphere is great serious bar scene a little worn in places it gets a lot of traffic fun to people watch good price;4
we stayed for five days in february in a central location especially if you plan to use the subway only a fiveminute walk from the nearest red line station comfortable clean room and beds bathroom starts showing its years but still fully functional a bit noisy because of window to the road the highlight is the breakfast with freshly made omelettes and waffles staff extraordinarily friendly and helpful never had a better deal for my money in la;4
i am tough on reviews having flown 28 million miles i always start with the first part ease of everything the software is great all my requests were taken care of except for high floor i was on 3 because that is where their club is checkin rooms all nicely done need comfortable view ok looking at lax but not their for that the club is well worth the upgrade breakfast in the morning lox hour omelettes everything you could want dinner all cold foods bur foods quality and3 fir a corrina wad nice club people also very friendly everything wad clean and un great shape works stay here again paid about 200 a night with club and included 30 of california taxes;4
pleasant check in easy location for universal quiet and large room with great views beds could be a bit bigger tight for 1 adult and 1 child great breakfast and coffee shop great service as well easy parking;4
stayed here in october 2011 with my sister check in upon arrival at the hotel the bell boy came to open the doors of the car and offered to take our bags for us check in was quick but a pity the room wasnt ready for us at 10am the same bell boy offered to store our bags for us while we waited for it to become ready and it did by 1pm room we got a room on the 4th floor facing the main road the hotel needs to improve on its sound proofing facing the main road wasnt a joke in the middle of the night or at anytime of the day in nyc you could hear cars ambulances and simply everything going out in the street it was terrible room was nyc standard small and squeezy it had 2 double beds flat screen tv a lounge chair wardrobe safe minibar and the bathroom;4
i have lived in california for over 30years and this was my first time at disneyland and i had a blast but the room was very nice the only thing we asked for a rollaway and we were charged for it but it was never put in our room and we were so tired we just made due;4
this is a solid hilton property with up to date clean rooms and public areas friendly service by all employees encountered the shuttle to universal was very convenient and ran every 15 minutes parking is 30nt but this is to be expected for la the diamond fb credit is 15day at this property which didnt even come close to the cost of the breakfast buffet at 28 all around a good property and i would return;4
we were looking for a reasonable priced by nyc standards hotel in the middle of the city since we were planning to be visit with friends in tribeca and harlem and were pleasantly surprised by the ameritania hotel just a few blocks from times square and close to central park this was the perfect location for our stay checkin was a breeze and the hotel staff were very helpful the rooms are not large but very modern clean and well appointed the bed was extremely comfortable â almost too comfortable since we didnt want to get out of bed the only downside was that our room was on the 3rd floor with a notsogreat view of the brick wallpatio of the restaurant next door the noise from the patio was very loud at times but it was tolerable we never heard our neighbors;4
myself and 2 other friends stayed here after finishing our work as camp counsellors over the summer in the states being students we werent wanting to spend most of our wages on a hotel so for the price that we paid we didnt expect much however the staff were friendly and the room was exactly what we expected cleaned everyday with fresh towels and bed sheets room was small but had a fridge and the tv had plenty of channels including british sport to watchthe area was fine with no bother at all it is quite northern compared to times square but it is only a 510 minute walk to the nearest subway station in either direction and plenty of food such as mcdonalds and dominos to eat all in all we were very pleased with the hotel and would recommend it to anyone with the same;4
one of the girls helping in the lobby during fashion week went out of her way to answer questions and welcome me as i worked on the mezzanine she gave me a card with the name lauren on it just want to thank you for a nice experience although i was not a guest that day i will definitely like to stay at the hotel if the staff is that friendly;4
i had a good stay at the hotel parking was convenient and i could easily access my car any time i wanted something that is nearly impossible in los angeles there is a small parking fee fyi the hotel is very beautiful inside and out the room was in the second floor and it had a king bed the only thing about the room i didnt like was the fact that the room didnt have a carpet so at night the floor was a little too cold all around i had a great experience and would definitely return if next time im in la;4
reasonable midtown hotel convenient to penn station the subway lines there may not be a more convenient location in the city like other wyndham hotels this is not as bad as the bad reviews nor as good as the top reviews first the gripes now way this is a four star no real sense of service always a mobbed front lobby aged hallways small rooms with no coffee makers or bathroom shelf space old tub fixtures and huge facility fee mandatory 3408 per day for free internet gym and business center so youre getting a 3 star maybe 35 on a good day hotel for well over 2 benjamins a day the better part redone lobby with several restaurants and bars attached a mildly interesting museum on the when this was a grand hotel the fixtures in the bedroom and bath;4
this was our first visit to los angeles and looking at hotels we were attracted by the name of the hotel it did not disappoint the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and a big shout out to cecile who paid us extra attention our room was one of the nearly refurbished and was extremely comfortable and suited our needs the balcony to our room was shared but not a problem in the slightest our room overlooked the interior courtyard which was beautifully lit at night but could be slightly noisy when there were guests out there late the hotel is very close to the metro station santa monica and vermont which is three stops 10 minutes to central hollywood the immediate area near the hotel is not particularly tourist friendly for example it is situated in a;4
i stayed at the jane for 7 nights in october from reading up about the hotel before i booked i already knew that it was something of a hotspot for the local hipster crowd with its cool barclub and retro style right enough the friday night i arrived late checkin at 1030pm there was a long queue of kids outside with taxis coming going every few seconds checking in the concierge i almost had to shout to hear each other the club is just around the corner from the checkin desk i was quite taken aback and asked the concierge jokingly if this was the hip spot to be on a friday evening in greenwich village he said yeah and saturday and sunday and mondayits like this every night thankfully it wasnt even on the saturday it was way quieter think it was;4
the hotel room was small for the wife i but that is standard for the city outside of the city the rooms are much larger the king size bed was comfortable and it was nice to have a safe the closet for hanging your clothes were the size of a broom closet you can hear the running water from next door no free wifi there is a surcharge but next door is strabucks and luggage space is very limited no coffee maker if you wanted to have a cup of tea but again there is starbucks not use to the half door glass shower stall and the other side is open to splash water onto the floor when u use too much water pressure there was no lamp at the desk the hotel is located 1 block away from central park great for a walk and rental bikes are available at the beginning of;4
we were visiting to take our children to universal studios this really is the best located hotel an easy 5 10 minute walk there is a lot to see at universal if you want to see the shows as well as the rides but if it is very hot it is great to be able to take a break and head back to the pool for an hour or two especially with children our room was a bit dated but we had a great view of universal the pool area and the pool bar are fantastic set in lovely gardens with lots of sun and shade the hotel restaurants seemed more suited to the large conferences held there than to family groups but lots of great family friendly restaurants on the universal city walk;4
i really enjoyed my brief stay at the historically correct jane hotel in the west village wish i had had more time to hang out in the bar and comfortable quirky lobby but would definitely return good value for money if you dont mind tiny rooms and a shared bath my only minor complaint was water all over the floor in the shower in the morning but luckily i brought my shower thongs as a few other reviewers have mentioned rooms in the jane suffer from the classic new york problem of being overheated so i cranked up the ceiling fan and cracked the window for some fresh air and it was fine this happens a lot in the winter with steam heat in nyc apartments and hotel rooms be advised i thought the service and food in cafe gitane downstairs was relaxed but responsive;4
nice hotel for a decent price a short distance from a fairly sketchy area of the city but itâs ny what do you expect great view of the city from my room excellent cleaning services provided lines were slow for both checkin and checkout but the stay itself was very nice;4
location is very good close to subway staff does what they can to help you with what you need i arrived late night and chris had a smile on his face and an outstanding good mood breakfast is in the rooftop and the view is amazing;4
we were at the empire hotel in march 2017 for spring break although not experiencing springlike weather we had an excellent experience there friendly staff clean rooms good service nyc is expensive and we found a pretty good deal on a double room online the bathroom was small but it had a great shower the beds were comfortable especially the pillows we wanted to take those home with us we never ate at the restaurant for breakfast or dinner but the food smelled good and the menu was interesting the hotel is right by lincoln center a subway station and lots of fun dining options we enjoyed the rooftop bar but be prepared to pay for your view we used taxis and ubers and they would pull up right to the front of the hotel all of the guys at the front;4
great location great service originally booked a metro view double room online when we got to the room the view was somewhat obscured by scaffolding spoke to the front desk and they agreed to move us the next morning as soon as another room was cleaned second room was much nicer and clear view of empire state building would have do rated 5 if we had the view room for the whole week;4

i booked the hotel online at their website 99 for a saturday night which in manhattan is unheard of of course as their website and to which these reviews can attest there are shared bathrooms on the floors other than those rooms which have their own i had no problem accessing them they were kept clean and i never had a wait for a toilet or shower it does take some getting used to taking ones sundries down the hall rather than having them at hand in the room the building itself is over a century old and restored workers quarters the rooms are very small however ergonomically clever the bed has two drawers one with a safe under it along with stowage a shelf is above the bed and there are numerous hooks from which to hang things there is ac and a;4
we enjoyed staying at the new yorker they are in the middle of renovating we were lucky to get a new room it was quite small especially the bed it was supposed to be a queen but i think it was more like a full they need shelves in the shower and bathroom for shaving kits it us close to madison square gardens and oenn station which has trains and the subway;4
for leisure purposes this hotel is fine hourly tour bus pick up from outside hotel and easy 5 minute walk to universal studios we had a corner universal facing room which was most comfortable spacious and roomy the bistrocafe was very good and the waiting staff were very helpful the food was good being a hilton gold honors a continental breakfast is provided which vouchers are issued there is the option to upgrade however if you dont take this you are brought a selection of items by a waiter it seems that customers are not trusted to go and just take items from the continental range thankfully having got through the first morning we were able to tell the waiteress what we wanted so we werent brought items we didnt wantthis was also time consuming as you had to;4
first of all locationwise this was pretty much perfect for me and my girlfriend as she was running the ny marathon and we needed somewhere close to the finish line being situated one block away from central park we found the location of the hotel to be ideal its also within walking distance of 5th avenue and many shops and attractions the hotel was very clean and relatively spacious as much as it gets in manhattan after we got a free upgrade from the very helpful julia at reception who made us feel very welcome after our journey from ireland she must have took pity on us but in any case she was just the type of person we needed to be greeted by after a long journey she was a brilliant ambassador for the hotel i had read before travelling that the lifts were a;4
just completed a couple night stay at the empire hotel i liked it and would stay again it is in a great location right by lincoln center on upper west side easy to and from newark airport especially room was comfortable clean and good shower nice little bar in the lobby and frank a terrific barman also the rooftop bar is worth a try too some good places to eat very close by as well;4
theyve got these tiny sailor rooms for a very reasonable price great if youre in town for a couple of nights dont want to spend and really just need a place to crash these rooms do not have their own bathrooms so youve got to go down the hall for that and the place has a bit of a worn feeling to it fix the loose tiles in the bathrooms but otherwise its got charm and a great location;4

honestly i almost cancelled my trip to nyc when i read the reviews about the hotel that would have been a big mistake since me and 4 of my friends spent a very nice not to mentioned relatively cheap 3day weekend in nyc in early march 2011 thanks to riverside studios hotel the room is very faded the paint is old the carpet is teared up in the corner and the place is a bit noisy but the room is large clean includes a fridg and a tv you share the bathroom but water pressure is very good and hot water is not a problem seriously i think its hard to ask for more at that price it cost us 20 each per nights 5 adults all included all this at a very walkable distance from times square and only a few blocks away from a subway station i surely;4
the free breakfast with ordermade omelets waffles cereal bagels fruit etc was one of the best ive had in a lessthansumptuous hotel the free wifi proximity to a metro station vermontsanta monica and the hollywood freeway are other plusses our room including bathroom was clean and comfortable the front desk staff especially michael was helpful and friendly i asked for an especially quiet room and the staff went to some trouble to make sure i got one a plumbing problem was fixed quickly the fitness center is well equipped the immediate neighborhood is uninteresting but los feliz hollywood and other more interesting areas are easy to get to from here all in all a good value;4
we stayed there for 5 nights loved this hotel when we checked in straight away we got a upgrade to room with a view the cleaners were in the room every day hotel was a great location we also got a late check out we will book into this hotel when we come back to new york;4
we checked in for our 4 night stay and were pleasantly surprised having read the majority of reviews on this site the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and adequate for what we needed a place to shower and rest after long days out and about the room was serviced daily with clean towels and bedding the location was perfect in a very safe area right by the subway and opposite a great deli which was open late and did excellent pizza and cakes for those late night nibbles only 2 blocks from central park and of course a starbucks over the street yes this is not a 5 hotel but is excellent value for money clean and safe we couldnt have asked for more;4

we were celebrating our 8th wedding anniversary and as part of our itinerary customised by our tour agent we stayed in the new yorker for 3 nights we were first given the executive room on the 7th floor the room was very nice and newly renovated but very small despite having a coffee machine amazing shower and charging station on both side tables we felt claustrophobic so asked to be moved upstairs with a view we were moved to the 28th floor the room was dated but lighter and bigger the shower head was very close to the wall but we were amazed how strong the water pressure was the bed and pillows were excellent we need this kind of bed in our home this hotel is located near madison square penn station macyâs and empire state building after checking in 2 ladies;4
the rooftop views warmed our hearts even on a cold new york city winter day we were in town to see theater so it was a real treat to have the tkts office on the same block as the hotel mr pasquale at the front desk was especially friendly and attentive at checkin time;4
this was a great property for its value the rooms were nicely appointed with stylish furnishings although they were a bit worn friendly staff a request for a new iron never materialized but it wasnt a big deal the ac could not be controlled in the room so it was either a bit too chilly or a bit too warm the location is excellent i would definitely recommend this hotel;4
ive stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in april paid 230 for a single room location is perfect its trully on the park however from my window i could see only a small patch of the sky probably rooms with the view on the park cost more room itself is very small but size is adequate for a single room in nyc looks a little bit wornout but in good condition bathroom is small but clean and looks pretty new which is a big plus one of the reasons i choose this hotel is a good public transport connection to la guardia airport bus or subway bus because of proximity of columbia university area aroud the hotel is full of bars just walk towards broadway i would stay there again;4
my husband and i stayed at the empire for 5 nights from the 20th november and we were a little worried as this was our first ever trip to new york and some of the reviews were not good to say the least we shouldnt have worried as we had a great time at the empire after speaking with celeny before we arrived who was so helpful and friendly we requested a room on a high floor and we were very happy when checking in as we were given a room on the 9th floor our room was a good size and was very clean with a nice bathroom and shower our bed was really comfortable and we slept well we did get a little noise from the heater in the room but that is the only negative that we could think of the roof top bar is lovely and the location of the hotel was great we cant;4
the empire hotel is perfectly situated if you are in new york to visit lincoln center as we were it is literally right across the street in bad weather all dressed up for the opera this can be an enormous convenience worth paying for the lobby is quite grand and the service is magnificent the staff certainly know their business our room however was tiny and poorly designed this is to be expected in an older new york property but for the price a renovation might have been in order the rooms certainly do not match the grandeur of the lobby they might even be called shabby though not dirty or unpleasant finally in the year 2016 i cannot give an excellent rating to any expensive hotel that charges for internet access in an era in which cheap;4
my room was fully paid for in advance through bookingcom and was upgraded at check in at an extra cost of 1400 usd per night the room was on the 36th floor i had a view of higher buildings and part of the hudson river and this was not worth the upgrade at all i paid a lot of money to stay in this accommodation for seven nights the tick tock diner was a 24 hour diner with good fresh meals and i recommend this place which is just off the hotel lobby i had a problem with one of the receptionists who was rude and unfriendly i reported her and finally got an apology from guest services after emailing them twice i am not sure whether to return to this hotel on my next visit to new york city the room was clean and although small it had a comfortable bed and reasonable private;4
jeff is an exceptional doorman when leaving he had an airport ride on standby for us at 645 am before he even started his shift all the staff were helpful and friendly all the doormen assisted with an elderly guest in a wheelchair who was in our party great location many amenities close starbucks bars reasonable casual lunch spots etc you can walk wherever you want to go in the times square and surrounding area;4
you cant beat the lincoln center location steps from theaters restaurants central park subway and shopping we recommend arriving with your own snacks and if you have them k cups for your coffee the minibar was horribly overpriced and they charged 3 per cup of coffee that said there are so many other benefits to the hotel fun rooftop bar ok lobby bar great location that overall that isnt a big deal we were able to negotiate a better rate 24 hours prior to check in well worth calling to see if you can call center was very accommodating front desk not so much if they cant give a better rate at least ask for upgrade from regular to queen room huge difference in size and thus comfort;4
nice hotel in good location close to lincoln center where we were going rooms are a bit dated and elevator is slow but the service made up for it dan burke at the front desk was exceptional we had a bit of a mishap with our reservation booking it for the wrong date and started to panic a little dan fixed it and made us feel so comfortable i gave this 4 stars for his service and making us feel so welcomed staff was friendly throughout dan stood above the rest thanks dan;4
arrived and booked in found room to be very small and dark requested another room and reception staff could not have been more helpful offered us two other rooms and allowed to decide found reception and bar areas very dark almost uncomfortable concierge was amazing and very friendly helped book lots for us found doormen also helpful but think that we were very lucky with reception staff who dealt with us on arrival as other requests were dealt with less well during our three night stay found the breakfasts very good and lots of choice enjoyed time on the rooftop but felt the stair access let it down over all experience and stay was good but feel that we were lucky attention to detail and better customer service would have made it special like this old hotel deserves;4

such a lovely hotel with very helpful and initiative staff we had booked a triple room for 3 adults but the first room we was in wasnt even big enough for 1 there was no room to put clothes a tiny hole to put a few clothes also no where to put any suitcases especially because all three of us had taken large suitcases with us as we were due to stay in the hotel for a week so originally we were very disappointed with the room because it was lacking in space for general living space also being three adults we were happy with two double beds but when we entered the room we then realised that the double beds are small double beds which we were not aware of as the website does not specify so if you are planning on sharing a bed in a triple room dont as the beds were;4
we stayed at the hilton universal for a short getaway and were very pleased with the hotel the entire staff was very friendly and helpful we want to give a special shout out to jesse the concierge as he was very helpful and knowledgeable of the city only ate at the restaurant there once during our stay and the food was good but service was a little slow we would stay there again as it is in a good location and you can get any type of transportation service you need to pick you up there;4
beautifully restored building nostalgic atmosphere tiny cozy rooms resembling a train car or shipâs cabin fun and different as well as affordable the mattress was too firm for my liking but they brought me an extra pillow a few minutes after i asked for it bathrooms are shared which is not my favorite but i knew that coming into it the one nearest my room appeared clean lovely antique marble sinks and tiled showers i would definitely recommend this for a budget stay or simply a different experience stay;4

we stayed at the universal city hilton for 2 nights in april i was very pleased with the location convenient to universal studios and universal city walk the check in process went well and the service at the front desk was excellent the room was very nice and even though we were only on the 7th floor we had a nice view of the hollywood hills no noise could be heard in the room from the freeway down below my husband visited the starbucks coffee shop down in the lobby area twice and said that the employees were not very friendly and borderline rude the bar has happy hour with drink discounts and free snacks the bar staff were very friendly and attentive they have a shuttle that will bring you to the entrance of universal but we waited along with several other;4

before booking i had read the reviews and had seen some of the lower ones but noticed that the good was were really good so taking a chance i booked a jacuzzi room for our stay after a convention we were attending in the city the check in was quick the staff was friendly and answered any questions we had about where to eat or how to get to attractions we wanted to see the room was huge a beautiful half circle bar we should have had a party it was clean the sheets smelled great the bed was so comfortable and the jacuzzi was wonderful was it a new hotel no it was older but very well maintained we ordered dinner in from the diner down the street the food was fantastic not sure why people concerned about the neighborhood we had no problem nor did we hear any sirens i;4

i designed to stay 2 days prior our long haul flight just so the kids will have ample rest before heading home after 2 weeks of non stop tour in the us i love the free shuttle service and the hospitality there are not much restaurant nearby so we ended up taking up their buffet bfast which was not much of a spread the attendants were very very attentive thoughi was offered to avail the hyatt regency club access which offered bfast mid snacks and light dinner not too much to choose from but the unli access to drinks yogurts nuts served us well room is spacious and they have a cafe and a bar on the ground floor to compensate the need;4
book this place ahead it has lots of quirks ill list a couple of them below it has a nautical theme including portholes on the hallway doors but not room doors and cabins instead of rooms the standard cabin which i stayed in is tiny but cleverly designed the hudson river is a twominute walk away a walkingjogging path lined with park benches and lawns is an evenquieter escape than this quiet hotel another great place to visit is the high line an aerial park that starts two blocks away next to the whitney art museum there are lots of galleries and restaurants around that area its a ten or 15minute walk from the nearest subway station 8th ave at 14th st but it always felt safe or the bellman yes theres a bellman in uniform like the rest of the;4

we were just in town for one night for a show at madison square garden so this hotel was perfect we took the train from jfk to penn station walked a block to this hotel then a block to the show and back room was super small wifi was spotty seriously there are bigger sinks in airplanes but the shower was full size and the room was very clean we spent 18 hours in nyc and this was perfect for our needs;4
the staff is not very warm in their welcome but i wasnâ´t expecting much they are certainly not prepared for nonnativeenglish speaking costumers but we got along with them fine the bathroom is very small but kept in excellent condition i think a large person would have a hard time getting around the kitchen is well equipped the air condioning worked just fine as well as the cable tv the place was very clean the location is excellent in the heart of upper west side just a few steps away from the subway it was almost perfect for me iâ´ve had a great time i will certainly return;4
every one was helpful smiling and friendly the only drawback was the size of the rooms which are small and the bed was small;4
its an old but well kept hotel and the biggest advantage is that once you are parked in their garage you dont have to worry about going to universal from there you can walk or take a shuttle we arrived at 11pm on a friday evening and were given key for a room in which someone was already living so when we tried to open the door the residents inside were shocked and we would have been too if someone tried to open our door when we were sleeping so that was a bad mistake made by reception but other than that very friendly service great room and great view of universal from our room would love to go back;4
people like to complain about everything but the more i travel the more i find that this complaining tends to be synonymous with one word american full disclosure i am an american citizen staying at the jane for many many months reminds me how simpleminded some criticisms are in this case when you spend less than 100 per night on a hotel in manhattans west village where i was born and raised what do you want a handshake with that at any rate the rooms are claustrophobically small and the spotlessly clean bathroom and shower is down the hall so the question one has to ask oneself is do you spend more than a couple hours in a day in your hotel room other than to sleep if not and you are in new york to explore or as in my case while i was;4
we stayed here during christmas and was as expected the rooms are onpar with this level of hotel but seems like its trying to be something its not it was the first time ive stayed in the upper west side but i prefer its counterpart the upper east side as there is much more to do it is in a great location however if you are going to lincoln center;4
after booking this hotel for our honeymoon through trailfinders we had some reservations after reading some very negative reviews on trip advisor regarding the condition and size of the rooms it is true that the hotel is tired and in need of some attention and modernisation but this doesnt take away from the fantastic service excellent location and value for nyc money carlos was so helpful and reassuring prior to our arrival and the concierge was genuinely one of the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable people we have had the pleasure of meeting we really hope that the empire can have the investment it needs to bring it up to standard so that more guests can have an enjoyable and comfortable stay alex nick;4
i stayed here for 3 nights at the end of september and i have to say after reading the reviews i was very apprehensive about staying here but was pleasently surprised when i arrived i had booked a room for 4 people with a private bathroom this is exaclty what we got the room had 2 double beds and enough room to move around it was like staying in a bed and breakfast without the breakfast the room was clean and had everything you would expect including a small fridge the room was cleaned every day and we had clean towels provided each time the room was cleaned the hostel is about a 34 minute walk from the subway and there are plenty of places to eat drink around the area all in all for what we paid and as it was only a place for us to sleep get;4

we needed to book a hotel that is near times square but not as extravagant as the ones located in the central midtown area so this was a good option for us we could easily reach times square and broadway within 10 15 minutes with no trouble there is a mcdonalds and a starbucks right opposite to the hotel some sketchy people here and there at night the lobby was spacious and had an atm along with a concierge the employees were very efficient as the lady who checked us in was amazing her name was rachael the guy who checked us out was also a lot of fun and extremely nice i forgot his name he was a chubby guy who dressed like a hipster who was on the early morning duty on the 3rd of september my main issue with the hotel is that it was a bit dated but i gave it the;4
two words coral castillo i recently stayed at the days hotel on 94th and broadway in new york the service i received was 4star at a 2star price the assistant front office manager coral castillo went above and beyond anything i had a right to ask for and more in the face of withering insults and abuse being heaped on her by other guests a scene i witnessed myself in the hotels lobby about matters over which she had absolutely no control coral stayed cool and never lost her smile this calm and pleasant demeanor served to disarm even the most unreasonable guests i stress this because it is a rare quality indeed in the hospitality industry in new york these days a guest is as likely to be told to perform an anatomical impossibility as be actually helped by staff;4

me and my son have just returned from a 4 night stay we were given a room on the 33rd floor with a great view of madison square gardens check in was smooth we loved the room yes the bathroom is dated but itâs a 1920s hotel and we liked the fact it still had period features tick tock diner was great ate there for dinner and twice for breakfast location wise this hotel is perfect not far from any of the attractions the only negative was the elevators took upwards of 15 minutes in the morning would be full of people and stopping on every floor it was a nightmare i would definitely come back in the future provided the elevators were fixed thankyou for an amazing stay ð;4
we stayed for 9 nights which i was kind of worried about at first but the price offered was unmatchable for a hotel of this kind once we arrived we were told they upgraded us to a city view room which is bit bigger and with a nice view of they chrysler building empire state and msg the room was nice the bed was comfy although very tall we arrived to see some concerts at madison square garden so this was a perfect location especially if youre planning to queue of go to the general entrance which is one street corner away from the hotel theres a subway station just around the corner a 24hour cvs and a duane reade just across the street a starbucks and a 24hour mcdonalds theres an italian restaurant a cocktail bar and a diner inside the hotel which we;4

for those traveling with a dog this really is the best place to stay they have a dedicated area for dogs to potty that is kept immaculately clean plus a âjog a dog treadmillâ to keep your dogs is top condition the hotel is central to shopping dining or if you just donât feel up to leaving a 2 hr diner is conveniently located within the hotel the staff are courteous kind accommodating to ensure your stay is perfect i had a great corner room with a view i couldnât have been more comfortable this is my 2nd time staying here and it wonât be my last;4
we booked this hotel to be near our daughter husband who live in silver lake turned out to be a fun hotel the staff was very helpful friendly the free breakfast was ok then the 2nd morning i had eggs to order the egg cook was great friendly and cooked everything perfectly the hotel was very quiet very clean and our room was surprisingly large its in an odd neighborhood and theres nothing around to see but if you have a car and want to be off the beaten path this is a bargain there is a subway stop one block from the hotel we will book the hollywood hotel in the future when we visit the la area its a friendly funky place;4
rooms were spacious and super clean conference area was more than adequate and tables were provided for easier note takingwrittenlaptop location is a fairly short uber ride to many good places to eatshop would not hesitate to stay there again or organize an event there;4
we chose the empire because of itâs appearance in gossip girl the downstairs lounge area is nice drinks are pricey rooms were quite tired looking poorly decorated with less than perfect wallpaper our room had no bathtub and was very small no trash can our wardrobe was just an alcove with a curtain across it but our friends had a proper wardrobe it was an ok hotel staff were friendly pretrip via email itâs a great location for central park 5th ave madision ave shopping etc i wouldnât rush to stay again;4
i booked two rooms at the ameritania hotel for our family trip in july of 2016 first impression of the hotel was excellent the lobby was clean and inviting the staff was friendly and helpful and was able to upgrade one of our rooms free of charge they were able to accommodated our late early arrival booked to checkin july 21st but did not arrive until 8am on july 22nd and had our rooms ready as soon as we arrived the hallway leading up to our room was dark and dated as for the room it was small but practical we barely were able to fit our two carry on luggages on the floor i wont complain as the price was very affordable for a location so central we were practically steps away from times square and broadway the one thing that was lacking in the room was a;4
walking distance to the airport get that cardio in first thing big pool great gym room was nice elevator had minor issues but dont let that stop you snack bar priceyi mentioned that when making a purchase on christmas evethey gave it to me free great staff;4
the hotel is in a great location being just a few minutes walk from central park and columbus circus the room we had was a corner room and therefore very large compared to european hotel rooms we were here for 5 days over the christmas period but i cant say the hotel felt particularly christmassy the lobby and reception area have been used for filming a tv programme gossip girl i think and as a consequence bus loads of tourists often come in a big group to take photos that didnt bother us too much but i can see how it could become annoying as discussed by previous reviewers having to pay for wifi nowadays its a bit of a cheek the lobby is also where most guests attempt to log onto the wifi for free so it is quite often difficult to find a seat and the wifi;4
i was in the city overnight took the train in from nj it was very convenient to be close to penn station good alternative to driving in and paying for parking the room was clean and the housekeepers were very friendly;4
we stayed here for five nights around christmas overall this was a really nice hotel in a great location a little bit out of times square but easily able to get in using the subway the room was small but what you expect when staying in nyc all staff were really friendly the only negative of this place was the lifts they were very slow and sometimes you would wait for 15 mins to get a lift down to the lobby;4
perfect location you are able to walk pretty much everywhere we even walked to battery park etc although i would not recommend doing so in the august heat across the street from madison square garden and a few bars minutes from times square or the empire state a few blocks away from hells kitchen you must check out the high line as this is also not far clean hotel which has friendly and helpful staff the lady on reception upgraded our room to a room with a view we didnt ask she just did it for free the bed was very comfy room small and basic but did include wardrobe space draws iron ironing board hairdryer and safe the hotel charges 2 per bag if you need to store them prior to check in or after check out the hotel can book you a private taxi to the;4
really enjoyed my stay here beautiful neighbourhood close to subway i parked for free on the next street over room is shockingly small but has all you need even provide bathrobe and slippers bed was comfortable i had a good sleep no issue with noise tv and ac worked well service was good never had to wait to use bathroom bathroom was clean when i arrived late afternoon and at night but was pretty gross at 7am looked like someone threw up in the sink but i understand that the cleaning staff dont work that early i would definitely stay here again;4
its not the most modern up to date or fanciest hotel in nyc but if you are a patron of the arts fond of central park like good food and some shopping bargains you cant go wrong staying at the empire convenience and pleasant staff good food and an iconic nyc bar right there lincoln center century21 a block from the subway 2 blocks from central park and affordable and they take pets cant ask for much more;4
we had a lovely weekend at hilton universal a quick and easy walk to universal plus delicious breakfast and decent room service too checkin and out was smooth and friendly huge room with upgrade view of universal made for a magical birthday weekend for our ten year old;4
this is our second time at the empire and it is great location for manhattan near lincoln center central park and columbus circle with access to several subway stops the standard rooms are small but the beds are comfortable and the amenities loccitane products very nice for the price i would suggest asking for a room away from the elevators as they tend to be noisier the downstairs bar is good for a quick cocktail cant comment about food or much of anything else except the staff is a bit standoffish and doesnt go out of their way to help except the doormanbellhops but this is a very busy hotel with lots of people going in and out all the time;4
this was my 4th stay at the new yorker and would not stay anywhere else the service and location is excellent and the tick tock diner is a perfect place to have breakfast and dinner cannot fault the only thing with this visit was paid for a view room and the room didnt have a view and was quite small have been lucky with rooms in the past which is why i keep going back have already booked my next stay for may 2017 the views are amazing so i have everything crossed;4
we had a brief stay at theis hotel and it was our first time here the staff was very friendly and very accomodating the hotle it self was very clean and up to date there was a little issue with the elevators being worked on however the hotel managment made it very easy to get on and off the elevators without any issues perfect location and close to universal studios great view we will be staying here again;4
i only stayed for a short time but i can say that i give it 2 thumbs up it is locayed very close to the centre and to bustrain station open 24 hours rooms are very conformable and an affordable price;4
we stayed here after a long night at universal studios they were able to give us group rates for a girl scout event so it made the trip super worthwhile rooms were very clean and the beds and pillows were super comfortable the bathroom is updated and overall it was a great experience;4
nice but noisy hallways doors constantly slamming all night comfortable bed nice shower plenty of hot water good for an overnight stay decent price hallway decor is disgusting loud and distracting;4
the location is good a couple of stops on the subway 3 or 15 min walk to times square very helpful staff room was very clean roof top is lovely but happy hour on thursdays doesnt extend there lobby is beautiful and good wi fiwe had the most amazing cheesecake at the italian over the road try it highly recommend a stay here;4
a friend had recommended the jane and i stayed for a night on my return to new york the location is great really close to the highline chelsea markets and greenwich village which has a great vibe the staff are friendly and helpful too i arrived on an early morning flight and an early check in was no problem at all the rooms are tiny but given you wont spend much time in your rooms its great value the communal bathrooms are clean and the robes and slippers provided make it a much more pleasant experience than id expected im quite a light sleeper so i have to say the noise is quite disrupting from the road traffic other peoples rooms and the communal bathrooms hand dryers but packing some ear plugs should help with that overall great value in new york;4
great location hotel is small quiet on the older side but is clean and reasonable and a good place to stay for business or pleasure across the street from lincoln center makes it a jem staff was pleasant lots of restaurants nearby;4
older but iconic new york hotel and we loved the art deco style corridors to the bedrooms are a bit shabby but the room albeit on the small side was adequate and clean the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was dated but again it was clean and functional tik tok diner is worth a visit location is perfect would definitely stay again;4
rooms were clean staff amazing hotel is fantastically situated within walking distance of all the major sites the hop on hop off bus is a 5 min walk away the art deco look of the hotel makes it feel like your walking into something special;4
this hotel is positioned really well right next to penn station and madison square gardens you do have to pay a resortproperty fee upon checking in but the value for the location is quite good wifi throughout as well as pretty large fitness center in the basement of the hotel available for use we checked in late at night due to our flight delays we arrived around 2am and check in was easy we took the train into manhattan from jfk to penn station without a problem we were able to walk to our boradway shows times square central park without a problem you can also take the subway easily and cheaply to all of these destinations as well as the rest of manhatten and the boroughs;4
our family of four w kids ages 6 and 2 stayed here during labor day weekend 2011 we were in town for a family event and decided to visit universal studios during the last 2 days of our stay this was my first stay ever at a hilton and chose this hotel because of the close proximity to the park the front desk was able to accommodate for our early checkin because i called when we were about 30 min away after checkin a nice lady behind the counter walked us to the elevator as we headed to our room we had a nice size room with a great view of city walk and the 101 freeway overall friendly hotel staff one employee even offered to take a family picture of us in their nice lobby the shuttle service was very convenient and ran about every 15 min there was one;4
the place is very good situated you have direct connection to the subway where all the main lines stop the room was clean and quite the staff was friendly and the sourrounding area was safe the price was too high but to this time was the new york marathon where all other prices were high as well close to the appartement is a store called trader joe where you can find your food for a good price dont expect that the stuff is cleaning your room every day but our room was clean and everything worked well;4
rooms are small but the location is wonderfulgood service great breakfast with a wonderful viewthe best is the location you could go anyplace in the citywe had been several times but this time the view from our room was terrible and the room smaller;4

comfortable hotel close to subway in a safe locationclose to cafesrestaurantsshops and fruit vendors open till latethe internet and elevators were not greatshort walk to central park and short subway ride to times square and the rest of this amazing city;4
growing up around new york i had some low expectations of the quality of the hotel but was pleasantly surprised by the location and cost of the hotel i looked into spending my spring break with my girlfriend and it was a perfect week though the beds could have been firmer and the rooms were a bit drafty at times i would recommend this recently renovated hotel to the tourist or the weekender for a romantic time with all the bling of new york head to the waldorf but for a comfortable stay without too much hassle stay here;4
smoking room availability is why i chose this hotel even though it was not the most convenient for my midtown business everything was fine except for internet which would not connect at all;4
this hotel is perfect location if you are planning a visit to universal studios its got a free shuttle bus to it but there is no need as its only a 5mins walk hotel is typical hilton and the price reflects that its very big rooms are clean and big but slightly dated and can be a bit cheesy staff are super friendly from bellboys to reception to car park attendant i asked the bellboy about prices for the theme park and not only did he go out of his way to find out but he also gave me vouchers for 8 discount off the ticket price requested a king bed but when we got up to the room it was 2 twins told the reception and they changed it within seconds with no hassle only thing to complain is that the parking is a bit expensive 17 per day for self parking they also;4
ive stayed here a lot over the past couple of years the hotel works if you get the right roomnot one that faces the interior building air conditioning unit or a room that you cant fit your luggage in make sure youre facing out for a nice view of lincoln center theyve done what they can with space but sometimes too small is simply too small for the most part the staff is very accommodating when it comes to requestsroom changes etc the rooms are clean and the gym is excellent for a nyc hotel gymwith views looking over lincoln center and broadway the value sucksbut no ones really expecting value in nycso one shouldnt complain about it if you want something more for your money youll have to sacrifice location and amenities gym roof bar etc;4
stayed here in may hotel lobby was amazing as was all the staff including the maids could not fault the service everyone was very nice and helpful however the only complaint i would say was the room was very small no room for 2 big suitcases we did manage to get moved to another room which was so much better and bigger the only thing that let it down was the bathroom was very small and very old but it is a art deco hotel the location was fantastic right next to penn station and a short walk to the empire state building there is also a restaurant called tick tock just off the lobby great place to eat at anytime;4
my second stay at the empire hotel primarily because of its location the heart of the upper west side with close proximity to great restaurants good shopping i always have luck with super early checkin and i can find a decent rate as to the roomsremember people this is nyc where rooms are small for the most part that said the empire for the price provides rooms that are decent cleanand the junior suite is really roomy enjoy midtown soho the financial district broadway etcand then come back to the peacefulness of the upper west side blocks from central park ill be back again as it definitely fits the need;4
the room was small but adequate european style clean elevators were fast never waited even a minute the only negative was that there were no empty plugs for my ipad iphone only in the bathroom thank goodness it didnt fall into the toilet had to unplug lamp friendly staff i liked the noon check out as my flight was later my initial flight was early 11a and they were able to accommodate me with an early checkin their check in is 3p amazing this hotel was rated a 4 star i would give it a 3 12 great location close to penn station and the highline and many other attractions;4
the jane is completely unique in my experience the rooms are more accurately described as cabins reminiscent of an old victorian train or possibly a passenger ship in the 19th century that is not a criticism by any means i loved the cosy feel of the place and the very authentic period feel to the entire building the bathrooms are shared and communal with private shower cubicles and toilets there were bathrooms at both ends of each floor each with 2 showers 2 toilets theres a club in the basement and a bar on the roof with an openair terrace so the jane is a popular and busy nightspot i struggled to sleep the first night but not the other 3 the location is brilliant right on the hudson riverfront a block from the highline and close to the subway west 14th st for;4
with only a 2 minute walk to central park times square and with multiple subways around we found this hotels location perfect the room itself was very big and the bathroom nice and clean however the room and lobby had a bad mosquito problem we did buy a can of bug spray and that fixed the problem quickly though all in all this was a great new york experience;4
if you are looking for a hotel near the universal studios this is it the location of the hotel is just a block awaythe hotel also provides complimentary shuttle to universal city walk the staff was very friendly the kids loved the pool the pool opened till midnight which was a plus i wish the self parking fee was a bit cheaper overall we had a great time;4
we had a two day break here whilst on a road trip wouldnt have been my first choice as i was interested in the universal studios tours but we had a very good room which was extremely comfortable and spacious i would like to thank yolanda who was extremely helpful when checking in;4
first i had a fabulous 3 days in nyc i loved every minute of it this is a busy hotel for tourists and is in ideal spot for sight seeing remember how much youre paying for it think about what you get in say london for that money the room was fine cleaned well and in medium condition yes the air con is noisythere are other facilities a gym v small and claustrphobic but hey walk 2 blocks to central park for exercise the lobby was always busy note that you probably wont be allowed to check in until 3pm but they were ok about you leaving luggage and going out ticket system and i had no problems with this my big problem was transfer back to the airport i asked the concierge to confirm this for me they told me how bad the service i had prepaid was the;4
i have stayed here a couple times for work beautiful location close to everything so thats a bonus the rooms have always been great too very clean and comfortable the only complaint is that the customer service could use a bit of improvement i understand its a busy hotel but guests should always come first and be treated with the utmost respect since we are basically the ones paying their wages still not a bad place at all to go to and see all that nyc has to offer;4
stayed at the empire end of october for 5 nights we were immediately upgraded to a larger room which was fairly large for ny standards restaurant was excellent and so were drinks in the lobby bar rooftop terrace was already closed though overall very pleasant stay would recommend;4
this was my second stay at the jane and it was as good as i remembered i stayed in room 361 single cabin room this time which didnt have much of a view but was less than 20 paces to the bathroom the staff were all very helpful housekeeping was thorough and i must make a special mention of the bellhop who went out of his way to help get me a cab when i left to go home the elevator was out of action but not really a big deal the towels are soft bed comfy and the free wifi and in room safe are very useful the hotels in a great area only a few minutes walk to the nearest subway ace l lines and with plenty of great eating shopping and quiet parks within walking distance the only minor negative is the noise i would recommend taking earplugs to help ensure a;4
excellent location we were able to get the train from the airport straight to penn station which was next door it was nice and quiet at night little to no noise the bed was very comfortable the bathroom could be a bit more modern but overall it was great;4
we were in room 610 for two nights the empire hotelâs location is amazing especially if one is going to attend performances at the metropolitan opera and if one is going at attend several however room 610 which was clearly seen by the hotel as a room for business types and probably not usually for two adults was very small so that if one of us was going to use the bathroom the other had to find a way to get out of the otherâs way so smallness for over 40000 a night is a bit much even given the location but the biggest problem was darkness in the 14 of the room which included the tabledesk there was no sort of lighting at all even a desk lamp would have made a difference this was very unsatisfactory as was the need to ask three times for someone to bring;4
stayed here for two nights check in was easy everybody very friendly and keen to help you with anything you needed taxis were always waiting outside and the tour desk and bell desk extremely helpful with any enquiries whatsoever lovely staff and excellent clean rooms had a wonderful stay with not a single problem whatsoever would definitely stay here again;4
just what we needed for an inexpensive stay in la this hotel is within walkable distance to the metro red line which takes you to hollywood vine and universal city we got free breakfast every day of our stay comedy nights in the basement attracts a hipsterish crowd not in the prettiest of neighborhoods but there is a good teriyaki place near the corner and a drug store if you need it to stock up on bottled water etc the front desk was super helpful and friendly;4
the empire hotel is located across from the lincoln center and a block and a half from central park fantastic location more importantly the hotel staff are excellent courteous hotel is clean enjoyed our stay;4
if you like old world elegance and charm then this is your hotel i call it a favorite when i stay in new york city location is incredible and the workability factor is great note of caution if you do not like older charming hotels then you might rethink your plans along with charm comes smaller rooms and also the building shows it self as being older service and atmosphere always outweigh these factors for my stays great place to stay for broadway plays;4
friendly front desk staff complimentary bottled water upon check in large clean room with comfortable mattress and pillows 15 discount to lobby coffee shop less than 10 minute walk to the theme park and city walk would stay here again;4
we stayed here in 2008 and were more than happy with our apartment from what i gather standard of places to stay in new york arent very high maybe our expectations were quite low however we were more than happy with our apartment to be honest who spends a lot of time in their rooms when staying in new york i would reccommend this place to friends family;4
arrived quite late check in was quick and easy very friendly staff was on the 22nd floor room 2274 room was bit small but it was clean bed was very comfortable but noisy but wot u expect it in new york city great location near to empire state madison square garden and penn station times square a 1015 min walk away in all had a great holiday would stay here again;4
my mother and i stayed at the jane for 5 nights in june 2013 the hotel itself is has a lot of character beautiful tile work wood panels nice decor we actually stayed in all 3 rooms i stayed in a bunk room the whole time my mother spent 3 nights in a single and then 2 nights in a captains cabin the bunk cabin is tight dont stay in this if you are feuding with your travel mate but it served my needs just fine the single room felt much bigger than the bunk room it is only for one person and has a slightly different design so there is better storage when my mother moved to the captains cabin our jaws dropped these rooms are big by any standard and are huge by nyc standards the shared baths are not bad at all they were always very clean the whole time i was;4
we had an executive room at the highest floor the view is great and sleeping quality really good the lobby has great life and even though it was renovated they still manager to make the good atmosphere it is only 5 min from the enstrance to universal;4
the room was a small one but i will never forget the quality of sleep we had after a really lot of walking the good sleep that offers a mattress is priceless i really would like to know the layers cooperating company;4
pleasantly surprised by this budget hotel room was clean and quiet but crowded with both beds bathroom decent size and well stocked tv reception poor and no cable elevator has some scary noises staff was friendly stayed 4 nights for daughters graduation;4
i stayed at this hotel in feb of 2003 and i thought it was fine awesome price you get free breakfast croisants fruit the hotel inside was nice our room was totally clean and i found the staff was really helpful even after the guy i was sharing a room with was rude to them the person i stayed with had a big problem with the noise in this hotel as he did with almost every hotel even though i thought it was totally ignoreable personally when i go to la im out all day until im dead tired and when i get back to the hotel i crash like a brick and then im up and out as quick as possible the next day so as long as the bed doesnt stick and the bathroom looks sanitary and theyre not like drilling a hole in the ceiling im a happy camper and this was more than;4

the front desk agent that attended us was a disaster not a single smile unfriendly very surly and seemingly bent on making our experience as miserable as possible there was an issue with the prepayment of my stay to the website i had a receipt that showed it prepaid but she did not have a record of that she said that she could not let us into our room until the issue was settled and that this could take several hours only when i offered to pay the first night cash did she relent she then gave us a room on the first floor next to the air conditioning machines which were very noisy i returned to the front desk and asked if the hotel was full yo give us such a room and explained that we were light sleepers she said that she could change the room and gave us one on the;4
we stayed for 13 nights the general experience was fine it is a good option if you want to stay in midtown manhattan and pay a reasonable amount of money beds are very comfortable very good housekeeping service;4
stopped here prior to catching our flight home the next day hotel was clean tidy and welcoming with decent sized rooms which were well equipped bar area was nice but menu lacked choice onsite snack bar was expensive;4
my sister and i traveled for my birthday week to nyc it was our first time to the states and we chose this hotel because of the pictures we saw online and overall reviewswe were not disappointed the location is absolutely great to begin with train station less than 10mins walk and times square is around a 2530min walk the hotel itself is asthetically nice to take pictures at we were upgraded to a bigger room on arrival which was very kind of them however the view from our room was very disappointing we were just facing another high rise building and didnt get the great city viewskyline the room itself was nice and very spacious the decor throughout the hotel is from the art deco era and i liked it also if you are a fan of american horror story it reminded me of;4
if your looking for something affordable but not a run down shed this is the hotel no breakfast is available but who cares your in new york average hotel with two sets of two lifts over 7 floors plus ph this offers good location for central park and subways from 96th you have 123 lines which take you up town and downtown little confusing at first but after a day you can get the idea better to get 7 day metro card if you plan on using them daily;4
great looking hotel lobby looks fantastic as if you had stepped back in time to the 1920s easy checkin and an abundance of lifts to access the floors room was on the small size but adequate for the 4 of us we had two double beds a small closet and a average sized bathroom with shower cubicle the tv was of a good size room was well kitted out the hotel was well located with penn station across the road within short walking distances were many shops bars and restaurants there was a diner on the ground floor of the hotel which served a great range of breakfast options well worth a visit my only negative i have is when checking in the receptionist said we had been upgraded but that upgrade transpired to be the room we booked in the first place this did not spoil;4
although the hotel interior is dated by 2010 standards our 48 hour stay was pretty good the location re proximity to universal studios is brilliant we arrived from australia at 1030am check in immediately no waiting and our room was ready a stroke of good luck for us the room was modest in size with 2 double beds my only complaint as we were on the premium floors it included a generous continental breakfast the pool area was gorgeous again modest but well maintained with a beautiful garden lawn and cabanas for our brief visit it was quite good;4
great location a short walk to central park the metro and several good restaurants bad points small bedroom and toilet i could not sit on the toilet without my knees touching the wall the room diy non filter coffee making machine was a 3 dollar room charge for each paper cup âouch â staff and concierge where very helpful but there must be better hotels in the same vicinity with a reliable elevator;4
the empire hotel was recommended by a friend who lives in new york and it was terrific we were in new york for the first time to attend an opera at the met location ideal as the met is across the street also very central for museums and other things we wanted to see funky boutique type of hotel that has a nice feel;4
i must start by saying that a four point review such as this means above average anyway that being said this hotel was surprisingly lovely i only say surprisingly because after we booked the hotel i was still looking around and found some really bad reviews of this hotel nevertheless we were attending the grammys and time was running out we stayed there from the 10th of feb thru the 15th and the accommodationsespecially for the price were just fantastic we had a minifridge and microwave and may i add a very nice clean room the hotel staff were all very pleasant as well after reading some reviews i was a bit scared thankfully it was more of a dream stay than a nightmare bottom line if you are going to a hotel in ca which is literally;4
good hotel at prime location our room can see the empire state building close to time square convenient to go uptown and downtown staff are extremely friendly;4
i was a little worried about the size and quality of the rooms after reading the reviews but was utterly charmed by this historic hotel after our 2 night stay i cant speak for the small rooms with shared baths we stayed in a captains room with private bath on the 2nd floor and what a room it was my 6 year old son loved the soaker tub we had a large balcony that couldnt be enjoyed due to the cold weather but it was a nice surprise and added luxury no view mostly apartmentscondos next door but that didnt matterjust to be able to open 2 french doors to the outside on a private terrace with outdoor furniture was nice you truly felt like you were stepping back in time as soon as you entered the lobby i wont divulge the charming details you have to find;4
my twin sister and i stayed in the new yorker last weekend and loved every minute we were celebrating our 30th birthday and when we checked in the hotel manager gave us a nice upgrade to the 30th floor and had a bottle on wine sent up to the room she was really friendly and couldnt do enough for us our room was small but it was perfect for what we needed lovely view of the hudson the bathroom was nice and modern had a walk in shower no bath we had a coffee machine water in our room on arrival the bed was super comfortable and didnt hear any noise from outside the room got cold but the heating was great and warmed up very quickly we ate in both restaurants tick tock diner and trattoria bianca tick tock was lovely we had lunch here service was a;4
the location of the hotel is great just opposite to the penn station walking distance to macy for shopping empire state building for a great view of the big apple if you like and around 10 minutes walk to time square if you want to take subway definitely convenient as it is in midtown manhattan you can have a lot of choices for food no doubt no matter fast food eg mcdonalds or a coffee at starbucks or some restaurant to sit down and enjoy the hotel also has a restaurant offering breakfast but we didnt try back to the hotel itself the lobby is very beautiful and the room is big compared with other hotels we live in manhattan a little bit old fashioned room but very clean staffs are friendly no matter the counter staff or the room service staff and the;4
astor on the park located on central park west was a delightful boutique hotel located directly across the street from central park my best friend and i spent four nights there enjoying the city for the money in new york city it was more than adequate it was clean and quaint the rooms were small but the bed was comfortable and clean the bathroom was newly remodeled the towels large and typical hotel toiletiers were provided including a shower cap which was nice its close to two subway stations theres a great little grocerydeli down the street where we got 2 bagels and 2 cups of really good coffee for 4 best deal in town one night the elevator was broken but they fixed it right away we had read reviews of this hotel before we went that made us nervous;4
the hotel was comfortable it could have been a little cleaner great location;4
im not accustomed to staying in a big city so this was new to me i expected at 300 a night it would be a similar room to what ive stayed in at other locations cities but not as big as nyc the room was really small but it was clean im not sure if the odor was in the room or just the city in general by default there is no coffee maker in the room you can request one i did this the second day after reading other online reviews along with the coffee maker i got a bag of four paper cups a bunch of pods of coffee and tea but they never replaced anything that ive used so by the end of my stay i was struggling to have coffee and tea when i wanted it it was hard to find a location to sit my coffee maker the small table was big enough for my laptop i;4
we arrived after a long trans atlantic flight to find la right in the middle of a heatwave tired and hot we checked in with very friendly and helpful reception staff unfortunately on getting to our room we immediately had to request a change as our booking specified we would have a safety deposit box in our room which it didnt hotel is not in a great area although safe enough and we planned to be out and about all day so did not want to have to hike around with passports electronics etc husband had to point out that we had a choice of hotels and we picked this one due to location to universal studios and facilities offered and we were moved to another room by manager after he checked we hadnt used anything in the original room new room was on a higher floor had;4
overall the hotel is great the location is perfect for visiting universal park and the city walk we spent one day at each i felt it was worth paying for the more expensive ticket to avoid waiting in lines at universal vacation time is too costly to spend it standing in line the hotel is having some trouble with the elevators but it was not a big problem i had to wait about 2 minutes a couple of times;4
we were checked in by mohammed who was extremely efficient great hotel yes the rooms were small however the beds and pillows are very comfortable but a fabulous location near madison square gardens macys penn station and the red bu routes easy walking distance to times square and broadway both restaurants on site are very good and the italian a life saver after a long day out with a good meal and wine on the doorstep if you have booked here you will not be disappointed and free wifi one tip when out and about eating ask what is their service charge it could add an extra 20 to it we were caught and it added another 75 dollars to our bill;4
i was really dreading the hotel from the reviews i had read on here and was expecting the worst from the price i had paid got to the hotel and a very friendly doorman helped us with our bags lady on reception wasnt overly friendly but not horrible either word of warning take a master card or visa with you if u dont then u will have to pay 100 dollar deposit until you check out the decor was clean and the atmosphere was pleasant after checking in we got into the lift which is very small but it took two of us and two people sized bags the room was fresh clean and smelt nice it was soooooo hot in the room but we turned off the radiator which i would advise there is an ac fan unit attached to the window and we had it on most of the time the bathroom was lovely with fresh;4
enjoyed a 5night stay at this hotel while attending a conference the room is luxurious and higher floors have panoramic views to the mountains lovely heated outdoor pool with pleasant patio and spacious hot tub tenminute walk to the metro station connecting with train routes around greater los angeles friendly concierge staff no good restaurants nearby just chains in universal citywalk a 5minute walk from the hotel recommended;4
great location so close to times square and easy to work to many other sites and places to visit the staff are lovely very helpful and happy to advise if required we received a free up grade and bottle of wine in our room as we were visiting to celebrate a special occasion thank ameritania for this the room was spacious and clean the air conheating was noisy but we rarely needed it so this didnt bother us the only downsides were no wifi in the room which surprised us you could have it but had to pay extra and the amount was 25 for 2 days i would have thought in this age it would be available we like to relax in our room and plan our next day hunt out places to eat etc which meant we couldnt do this also no tea and coffee facilities in the room yes you could;4
the rooms are just as expected and as shown in the pictures neat and well distributed i think the best part is the breakfast hugo and his team are such nice people the attention and service are great and the food is good too by far the best asset of the hotel;4
you will be hard pressed to find a smaller room than in the jane so why four points first of all you get what you pay for what else should you expect at this central location for this price but then there is more its realy clean there are little things like free water and slippers and best of all everyone is really friendly just dont plan to hang around in your room it is strictly sleeping only however the cafe is worth a visit even when you are not staying overnight;4
very nice hotel in a good location near metro stations the room was clean and comfortable and the employees were very corteous and helpful making our stay easier special mention to hugo the cheff in the breakfast he is not only an excellent cook but he is also very efficient and supportive;4
nice hotel and well positioned for disneyland nice swimming pool although small good large helpings of food avoid the burgers massive good staff enviroment friendly hotel look out for film stars who stay at hotel;4
if you are planning a trip to see universal studios you need to consider this hotel i just visited today and was very pleased with my room and the service i received the 15th floor gives you a beautiful view of la and the corner rooms give the appearance of more space the king size bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice the tv had a very nice picture and i thought the remote was very nice and modern you will also have some fancy water in the room which was actually not a bad price for the pelligrino and the other water i do like that they have an outlet right next to the bed near the tv so you can iron and still watch tv i took a photo for you to see the view from the west side of the hotel the other side of the hotel will give you a view of universal;4
we spent 5 nights at empire hotel the room was a little bit small for two double beds for 3 shopping ladyâ´s but we manage the staff was great helpful and always smiling my biggest thanks to maria and jimmy who solved a problem with a piece of clothing i had purchased i would stay there again;4
i have stayed at this hotel many times great location across the street from lincoln center on my last visit pasquale on the front desk made my stay even better i arrived a little earlier after a long morning trip and a room was not ready he helped me get settled and upgraded me to a larger room with a beautiful view pasquale made every detail comfortable and convenient for me those touches including the fresh fruit in my room at night and the wonderful location make this hotel worth returning to again and again for business or pleasure;4
we stayed on floor 22 and had a view of universal studios and the hills behind it it is an amazing view the rooms were clean and comfy they provide a free shuttle to the universal city walk and universal studios we had a nice brunch in the hotel restaurant we only stayed one night but i would stay here again if ever in the area they want 800 for a toothbrush so dont forget your toothbrush but its hilton;4
little aprehensive bout the astor prior to our stay having read lots of negativity if you want good value for money clean and comfortable then this is the one couple of delis close by for drinks and breakfast reasonably priced internet access here too two pcs only but we never had to wait to get on them a little out of the buzz of ny but taxis are inexpensive and by far the best method of transport we got duped by a guy at the metro station on our first subway trip trying to work the ticket machine beware we saw him there a couple of times trying the same scam helping to assist in buyin your tickets and then giving you expired tickets whilst he pockets your money unnerving to say the least also be careful to catch the right train back and not to get;4
nyc is famous for small rooms this inn is no exceptionsmall yes but we had everything we needed and it was clean and so convenient to the subway which is all we really need or expect out of a hotel room in this city we found the staff to be friendly and helpful love the tiny wine bar across the streetsoft jazz and oh so quiet and soothing nothing here would suggest a recent remodel to be sure but we have no complaints at all thanks to the staff for a good clean room at a decent price during a short trip during the holiday expensive season;4
the hollywood hotel was close to a metro system which made it accessible to tourist attractions such as the hollywood sign and the griffith observatory arriving at the hotel wasnât quite what we expected as the picture advertised are from the back of the hotel however inside is exactly as shown and the room was comfortable and spacious;4
location next to penn station has always been a plus as you can catch the amtrak to washington or boston or takes the train the jfk and newark as for the hotel its heyday was in the 30s when it opened and that continued through the the start of the 60s the foyer is still impressive even if it has been slightly remodelled if you are lucky enough to get a view looking towards the empire state building it is one of the finest views in manhatten the room was well furnished but possibly a little smaller than we are used to in modern hotels but perfect for my use the bathroom often the criticism of this hotel was clean and well equipped not modernbut it all works the air conditioner has been shoehorned into this old building and does its job but can be a little;4
if you are planning to visit universal studio hollywood there is no better place to stay than the hilton universal city located a short walking distance from the theme park the hotel offers a combination of convenience quality lodging and friendly services at first glance the selfparking at 30 a day may seem high valet at 44 a day but the multiple entries ease of getting into the hotel from the parking structure and generous size parking spaces quickly made the daily parking a bargain of sort the lobby is fairly congested but expected for a theme park hotel it is par for a upper range facility under the hilton brand in terms of appearance with generous glass and stones the elevator issues hotel has been systematically shutting down and updating them was;4
this was a good choice for one night it was close to were i needed to go the hotel was clean and everyone was friendly restaurants and bakery are nearby as well as lincoln center my only complaint is no in room coffee maker and no usb ports;4
positives good location 2 minutes to hammersmith station 5 minutes to sainsburys superstore poundland and whs clean room cleaned every other day shared toilets and showers clean soap provided wifi is paid but very reasonable 1 pound per hour and good coverage wellequipped room a fridge all rooms i think and plates with cutlery if you stay in private room negatives staff very rude reception staff maintentence staff dont speak good english wifi is paid no overnight baggage storage small kitchen with no cooking utensils like saucepans or frying pans;4
came here for the weekend so convenient to midtown theatre district although no hotel restaurant there were excellent restaurants nearby room was clean and bed very comfortable great shower concierge staff were very friendly and helpful;4
this hotel is a good stay for the price and location the room was a great size staff were brilliant especially kitchen staff the wifi was good but limited to how many people could go on it at a time the views were great if you had a room looking towards the la skyline even on the balcony you had a great view wherever you looked the hotel only did breakfast there wasnt an option of dinnertea no reason why the breakfast was great the pool was nice also was warm and clean the hotel overall was kept in great condition the subway was literally 2 minutes away from the hotel which is great taking you straight to downtown la the area is good but can be sketchy sometimes depending on what time youre planning on coming back we got an uber if we knew we would be;4
the hotel was fine pretty clean and a good space for new york city i realized quick i was not a fan of chinatown so we will probably not stay here again but it was decent the staff was extremely helpful friendly each day;4
across the street from msg very convenient if travelling using the subway walking distance to macy highline times square lots of restaurants and bars in area for a new york hotel rooms very spacious;4
i brought my mother here to celebrate her 80th birthday as she had never been to manhattan we contacted assistant manager joseph rauer to ask for a room facing lincoln center and when we arrived we indeed had a room with a view and a surprise bottle of bubbly to mark the occasion thank you joe the location of this hotel is perfect if you are going to see an opera at the met or a tour of central parkright in the hub of midtown manhattan the staff were friendly and helpful and the beds were comfortable it should be noted that there are no grip bars in the bathrooms to make it accessible for elderly people but for the young and mobile this is a great choice to explore the city thanks for helping to make this a memorable trip for my mothers birthday;4
this location is super convenient for a trip to universal studios the staff here also were super friendly i should have written down some of the names of the ladies of the front desk we came in late on our 1st of 2 nights and our only option was to order pizza from pizza hut which was was tasty and delivered to the hotel we were a short walk to universal studios which was our only place we visited while here a wax robert pattinson greeted in the lobby parking was self park and very easy;4
as the other reviewers have stated hotel worked fine for us one nite stay for a graduation this is not a fancy hotel but good location hotel is clean and staff is friendly and helpful a reasonable price for nyc lots of food around the hotel too i booked on the days inn site;4
i recommend this place because itâs in downtown so itâs closer to everything especially because me and my husband loves koreatown we just had a little complication with the parking because when i booked my reservation they didnât mentioned that we need to pay additional for the parking and it was 2650 for one night not exactly sure if itâs per night cuz weâre only staying for a night they also had problems with their gate because i think it was broken so we had to go back to the exit so thatâs kind of annoying however ali the front desk was great he accommodated my request to king bed 3rd floor facing the court yard instead of our original standard queen bed the room was clean yet i think they need a renovation because some of the walls are old and cracked also;4
i recently stayed at days inn hotel and i would definitely return this is a budget hotel and is perfect for a base to sleep and shower we had a couple of problems with our bathroom and the staff were very friendly and helpful and got the problems sorted quickly for us the room was cleaned everyday our room was boiling on our first night so we asked if the heating could be turned down and this was also fixed for us wifi is a little slow but it does work thanks for a great stay;4
couldnât fault the location of this hotel next to maddison square garden empire state and also the subway only problem we had with the hotel was 5 to store luggage after check out and also a communication issue when i was advised an upgrade cost of 153 and it ended up being more which i had to pay which was 272 total;4
we went to manhattan and stayed at the new yorker hotel we have been there before and love the style and atmosphere and design they house the tik tok diner which is a great and reasonably priced family restaurant our room was a two bedroom suite and very spacious we had asked and hoped for a better view last time we had a great view of the empire state building but cant get everything we went to see beetlejuice the new yorker is convenient to all of the theater district it also has great subway access the 34th street station is right there hoped on the subway and it was a ten minute ride up to the museum of natural history which we always wanted to see we had a minor plumbing issue in the bathroom that didnt get resolved but it was a weekend and did not;4
my daughter and i stayed at the empire hotel in february 2014 and we absolutely loved our room the concierge at the front desk named nick was just so friendly we were warmly welcomed by him and his team and i really need to also make a positive comment for the guy i hassled on a daily basis regarding taxi weather directions etc lovely man and always helpful forgot his name but always was there to open the door for me when i was going out;4
good location and overall good experience staff was very nice when arrived and leaving great spot in the middle of everything i would recommend staying there to my friends the price was also affordable;4
the last time i stayed at a hyatt in ontario i was thoroughly disappointed i was nervous about staying at this one but check in was a breeze they gave me a large room clean room and per my preferences for hyatt i just didnt care for the fact that valet was 55 for 1 night and to self park it was 26 for every time i need to go in and out i think parking should come with our stays;4
perfect location for lincoln center which was my reason for choosing this hotel i also knew the restaurant and liked it very much my early contact with staff at the door and desk was warm and friendly which is nice in a big city hotel;4
for a hotel in the middle of new york i was expecting to pay with an arm and leg but the price was totally fair we had a two bed room it was super small so dont expect to hang around in your room but lets be for real if your just chillin in your apartment while visiting ny you should have just stayed home the only reason that i gave it one less star than perfect is because our room was in the corner my the alley and it smelt like cat pee so if you go try not to get that room;4
location rules is a lesson we have learned through our travels and the empire hotelâs location can not be beaten in nyc but for the great location you have to sacrifice and here you will sacrifice amenities the empire is virtually a few steps away from the lincoln center a few more from grand central park and julliard and a chipping wedge from columbus circle taxis and ubers are constantly in front of the hotel entrance all the subway lines pass through columbus circle and the bus stops are right there when hungry there is pjclarkeâs rosaâs and the smiths within a few minutes or less walk the hotel is extremely clean and the cleaning staff receives kudos the front desk is very helpful but the door guys will go the extra mile for you now the amenities like wifi;4
the new yorker is a famous and very large hotel dating back to the 1920s when you go into the hotel it has a modern and very spacious feel but still pays homage to the original art deco style the chandelier and ceiling in the reception area are a great example of this in the basement there is a very interesting exhibition of photographs showing the history of the hotel and some of the celebrities who have stayed there some reviewers have commented on the size of the bedrooms but our twin bedded room was really large and very comfortable and with fantastic views of the madison square garden and the empire state building to lie in bed with the curtains pulled back and see the esb illuminated at night was a wonderful experience unfortunately the bathroom did not match the;4
i stayed at the jane for 7 nights whilst incredibly apprehensive about the small single room after a night or two i loved it the shared bathroom didnt bother me and i never had to wait for a shower or toilet i was on level 4 and recommend that as it is in the middle of the building and away from the nightclub thurs fri sat and the rooftop bar the old rose cafe on the ground floor has a fantastic breakfast and evening atmosphere all staff were really helpful friendly and welcoming the hotel can be noisy when the nightclub is operating as well as when people who dont think to close their room door quietly at any hour i would recommend the jane and definitely stay again;4
heatingair conditioning was unsatisfactory difficult to sleep because of the heat and necessary continual fan breakfast was very good no need to go out to dinner because of the good quality of restaurant loved the location;4
wifi access was a little expensive but apart from that it did the trick comfy enough bed and a good shower ac was quite loud but then what ac isnt very friendly and helpful service from personnel behind the desk allowed me to store my luggage behind even after id checked out so that was very handy;4
the location here is so perfect there is an amazing rooftop patio bar on 34th st near 8th its close to madison square gardens a stumble away from empire state building the subway and close enough to time square that you could really just walk there i would absolutely stay here again as no other place beats the value you get for the price you pay;4
our family of four stayed at this hotel over spring break 2013 after reviewing the opinions of others on this website the reviews were mixed so i was a bit nervous i would say that it is not the nicest hotel i have ever stayed at the room was a bit small and could use a little tlc but not bad i actually thought the common areas were very nice the breakfasts were great the best thing though was the nice gentleman in the small gift shop who let me take a map and pay later as i did not realize it was cash only and was on my way out and when i found him later to pay he gave me a little candy just for bringing the money i owed we did not use the pool area because it isnt heated and it wasnt hot enough out the location was ideally suited for us because we were in town;4
better than i expected had a great comedy show downstairs in the bar at night rooms were good great location night manager was a bit of a rip off merchant so i would organize stuff ie transfers etc with day staff got a cheap deal through getaroomcom;4
located right across from the metropolitan opera the empire hotel could not boast a better location when i arrived nick at the front desk upgraded me to a king room without my even asking he was very friendly and accommodating similarly charming were the bartenders in the lobby lounge at 19900 per night it was a great value too the fitness center which is accessible 24 hours has recently been renovated though not large it is well equipped the bathroom is minuscule a la scandinavian style i guess nyc real estate is very pricey these days one little surprise they charge 300 for each little coffee packet for the keurig machine ive never seen this done before anywhere of course im used to seeing overpriced inroom amenities such as liquor;4
the hotel itself was very nice rooms where lovely and the pool area was very nice and also breakfast was really good the downside to this hotel is the location i didnt feel very safe there no where decent to walk to in the evening to get a meal lots of homeless around there i would not stay at the hotel again only because of the location i thought parking at 2200 per night was expensive as well;4
i was wowed by the super efficient friendly reception at the the front desk when i checked in early evening november 18 i forget her name alaysa but not her keen attention to my requests wonderful customer service my room was recently renovated clean good use of space and color clean with lovely presentation of amenities housekeeping had obviously been well trained clean clean clean room size was typical nyc cozy hotel location was great only 2 blocks from 96 st subway accessible subway stop good area of the city bakerypizza place on corner good for breakfastlate night snack indian restaurant midway up the block had tasty food with good service nail salon 2 blocks from hotel had manipedi for only 20 dollars it almost seems as if anthony melchiorri;4
having stayed in easy hotels in london i am used to tiny rooms but this was better for a single traveler as there was plenty of room under the bed for my bags the ac worked fine as felt comfortable despite the boiling heat outside it was a little noisey but it was easier to get used to than the heat the shared shower and toilets were good always clean and never busy when i needed either as there was 2 of each the big downside was the elevator was broken down when i checked in and and when i checked out although the staff were willing to carry my bag if needed and even when working it seemed slow there was a nice cafe i dont know if it is a part of the hotel but you do access it from the hotel served nice food and drink with friendly service great location if;4
as soon as you step out of the elevator you feel concerned as the halls appear dirty dated and dingy however when you get into your room yes they are small old and outdated but the rooms are clean and comfortable hotel would def be improved by the hallways being renovated positives were the front desk staff who gave me a choice of views and were efficient and friendly and the location i came to nyc for a concert at madison sq gardens and it is just across the road which made my life so easy i would def stay here again thank you;4
the art deco lobby is beautiful and the location is very good near msg penn station and a short walk to times square where i had business meetings the rooms are small the bathroom door doesnt even open all the way or it would hit the toilet but the bed is great the dresserdesk is nice and the closet is small but functional free inroom wifi was nice a lot of business hotels annoyingly nickel and dime you for this not a place id stay for a weeklong trip but for a short business trip it was great;4
i stayed at the new yorker for 10th time and the changes are quite noticeable this time we are assigned to a hc room and it was nice certainly the service staff is fd and housekeeping staff is quite corteous luis the door man makes the stay much easier with his positive attitude and help in getting transportation service in tic toc is fast and good food reccomendation for customers call and reserve direct to get the room you want when using an ota you will receive the least desirable oprtion;4
the room was a good size for the amount of time we were there but the bathroom needed some more attention to the details there was no coffee or tea included with the rooms neither was wifi which was a shame there was free wifi in the lobby but if you wanted it in the room it was an extra charge which was a bit disappointing especially with the cost of the hotel;4
we have a great experience and the hotel was perfect for being centrally located for all of manhattan however the room was small with 2 double beds the staff was extremely nice;4
the empire hotel is really a gem in a perfect location the room rates are very reasonable for the size and quality of the room i dont like that the charge for internet was 9 a piece per day the snacks in the room are higher than most places ive stayed and it would be nice if they would throw anything in for free internet water something i would stay here again right across from lincoln centerplus the air conditioner broke twice otherwise the room would have scored higher;4
great location comfortable rooms decent food shame that towels are not checked daily to see if they need changing and tea and coffee facilities are minimal given the price id expect a bit more even of a premier inn;4
our room was on the 2nd floor and they are still renovating the floor while the sleeping area of the room was wellappointed and renovated the bathroom was only partially redone the neighborhood the hotel is in could be considered a little sketchy and i dont know that i would be comfortable walking around there at night limited options in terms of restaurants in the area but many places will deliver and the hotel has provided a binder with menus etc in the room parking is offstreet and secured;4
this hilton is probably the closest hotel to the universal studios the studios are just a short walk from the hotel lobby rooms are large and clean great view friendly staff the pool is small and rather noisy as it is very close to the freeway i would reccomend it only if you are planning to spend more than one day at the universal studios everything else is far away expecially the beach;4
walkable distance to times square and central park nice rooms and good service jeff left a great impression very nice and helpful service the ac was very loud we had a power cut but within 2 minutes after calling the desk a worker came to fix the problem;4
a friend and i stayed at the empire hotel for the first time and enjoyed the comfortable beds and perfect and safe location for the purpose of our trip proximity to central park eateries the lincoln center walking distance 15 min to moma and shopping made it a perfect choice for us the staff was helpful and friendly and mostly responsive to our requests bathroom lighting was passable room pleasant and clean would stay here again;4
i dont know why i did not know about this great spot before the access to just about everything you could want was terrific we were upgraded without asking and were given great rooms and suite the staff was very friendly and accommodating the internet access was not great but this would not prevent us from returning soon;4
10 min walk to the metro to reach downtown la otherwise easy to get a taxi as always in la it is a question about distances very good hotel nice view over interstateroads minor was that some of the meeting rooms was severly affected by heavy traffic passing by outside the whole room jumped at few cm each time a larger vehicle passe by;4
have been here recently twice in the last month for business purposes even though the location on a map seems far away from everything it isnt quick drive to burbank quick drive to west hollywood very convenient nice room with good amenities wifi didnt suck issue price for restaurant while the continental breakfast was included for me as a gold member the 10 add on was ridiculous especially if all you wanted was a few slices of meat or cheese the really need to revamp what they offer for continental most concierge lounges in marriotts have most of the food available for free;4
from the art deco lobby to the comfortable rooms onsite diner and location the wyndham new yorker hotel had it all very comfortable beds classic art deco fittings friendly and very helpful staff no complaints whatsoever for the size of the hotel there was never a long wait for the lift a bonus when we were desperate to get onto the nyc streets to explore hairdryer in the room was perfectly adequate and uk straighteners worked just fine shampoo conditioner and body lotion supplied so pack shower gel wouldnt hesitate to return to this hotel;4
the receptionist spoke portuguese to our surprise and was extremely friendly and helpful at our arrival unfortunately the lift was not working which made us go up to the 4th floor with our bags they offered to help they could not get it fixed throughout our 5 day stay when we booked in there were only the bunk cabins left it was way smaller than we expected it is really small but it incredibly fit everything we needed unbelievably clever interior design allowed for 2 tvs lots of hooks for clothes and towels they provide excellent white towels and robes as well 2 big drawers 2 bottles of drinking water which they also provide daily for free in very charming customized glass bottles which are not free the pillows were marvellous and there was central;4
my sister and i stayed at abercorn house during out visit to london before leaving i read a lot of reviews on the hostel and a lot of them were not so great these people were clearly overexaggerating we had a double room with shared bathroom the beds were ok there was a large fridge in the room and there was a decent wardrobe with a large mirror the shared areas were always very clean the kitchen toilet and showers were very modern and were cleaned daily staff was very friendly the people at the reception were very friendly as well they waved at us when we left when you go to a hostel you know it is basic and you know there can be some noise our stay at abercorn was very pleasant and when we go to london we will definitely go back;4
we came for a few days and loved it the lobby and mezzanine is great for checking in to the free wifi and having a drink the roof top cafe and bar is great for a view and for breakfast buffet at usd28 our room was nice and big but we had to keep lowering the temperature time and again as it was a bit too hot the location is perfect for visiting midtown museums and the central park all within close proximity itâs also walking distance to shopping and entertainment at columbus square or the new nordstrom and itâs right next to lincolncenter with opera house ballet and the philharmonic orchestra totally perfect;4
we went to ny for a week and wanted to stay somewhere central close to the theaters and subway this hotel is kittycorner from madison square garden its a beautiful busy bustling hotel with a grand old lobby and historic exhibit in the basement the staff is friendly and immediately upgraded us to the newer part of the hotel the room was larger but not by much the bathroom updated but it was on the 7th floor with no views we requested to be moved back to what we booked a room with either a view of the hudson or the empire state building a little older smaller but clean and comfortable if you require a large tv this is the big difference the newer room has larger 50 in tvs whereas the older room had a 32 in tv we didnt spend much time in the room;4
yes the service is slow at times but the night front desk manager was a life saver instead of calling a cab for us the next morning for the airport he suggested we save the money and just walk 50 feet to broadway and hail a cab said we would be lucky if we were there 30seconds he was spot on when we needed towels the night manager personally got them for us the rooms are clean have nice amenities new bedspreads and desks etc and a nice modern feel to them subway is about 50feet from the front door times square is about 1015 minutes away by subway having said that yes the cable was out when we were there too hmmmmso dont go to watch tv lol but this is nyc you should be out having fun;4
i visited this hotel late last year to be honest with you i was unsure about this hotel but because it was in the right location i decided to go with it there was a lot of talk on here that it was not in a good area this hotel is near hospitals and the area is safe it is between two subways station one around 5 minutes walk at the most the other is around 15 minuite walk which is very handy for those without a car we had a car so it wasnt an issue this hotel is not actually right in the centre of hollywood it is around 510 minuites drive at the most from the centre of hollywood there is a carpark at the hotel but it is expensive we just parked on the road at the side of the hotel you need to read the sign because one day in the week they clean the road in the;4
we stayed here last year just before christmas and did the same this year the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating the hotel is clean and well maintained but gives you that new york charm we had a room with a view of the garden and empire state building great location and well worth a stay;4
used my wyndham points for two nights and purchased two more nights notified front desk at checkin and had a seamless transition between to two reservations keeping the same room we found our room in excellent condition standard room was a bit small but not enough to disappoint since little time was spent in it new yorker is perfectly positioned for the major sight seeing locations with the empire state building two blocks away and madison square gardens across the street we look forward to another stay sometime in the future;4

i stayed at this hotel many times and i have problems with their shuttle bus since hotel is cousing bus with parking lot shuttle they are either not on time or very rude drivers i already told to management several times good news is they are the closest location to lax and newly opened rc is good operation manager bill was great and was patient to listening my complaints and staffs are good;4
pleasant base for weekend sightseeing and broadway bit steep for in room coffee plenty of coffee shops nearby though with a better cup for the same price junior suite beds very comfortable and we enjoyed the quiet of the floor after spending the day on our feet sightseeing;4
had a great stay at this hotel last week clean rooms chic design unique layout good location staff was especially friendly and helpfulspecifically ricky who went out of his way to help me track down my phone i left in a cab at 230 am customer service prevails always only gripe is the 20night internet charge which is pretty steep;4
the location does this hotel wonders ive been to nyc many times and i absolutely love this city i chose this hotel because of its location it is close to pretty much everything the room was clean and noisy of course but thats nyc the front desk was friendly but this is the first hotel ive ever been in where they have a security check to make sure you have a key card for a room the hotel is always busy and it is great for a short stay would definitely come back;4
were just back from a stay at the ameritania and we loved the location very central for new york 5 mins walk to times square easy walk to central park 10 mins museum of natural history 20 mins friendly staff helped with check in and the door staff were very approachable and helpful there is no lobby bar but the 3 monkeys next door is a good place to have a drink and there are plenty of restaurants near by we upgraded the room but it was still a bit small to be expected in nyc but was clean functional and stylish our only gripe was that the bathroom was so cold we visited in february and the average temp outside was around 2 degrees c and so was the bathroom that aside its a great base to explore the city and i would recommend it to those who want to;4
hotel in walking distance to subway station and lincoln square and plenty of restaurants the area is pretty quiet and there is not a lot happening after midnight in this area its pretty easy to get a cab check in was easy and they let us check in early the cleaning lady was so efficient and nice the bellman were helpful the only issue i had was that i asked the concierge how to get somewhere and his answer was take a cab as if to say duh lady he even kind of chuckled he didnt offer any other explanation and he was done that was his complete answer i prodded him a little and said well what about the subway he finally gave me a map and told me which line to takehe was wrong i was lost in the city for 3 hours on an endless subway ride also the streets are;4
great hotel and the perfect location right next to madison square garden and times square a lovely man called muhammad checked us in and looked after us so well we were really impressed with the level of service highly recommend if you are looking for a spot that feels close to everything;4
hotel was clean and housekeeping did a good job in the rooms found reception staff a bit hit miss check in was not very friendly did not explain hotel facilities after a 16 hour flight a smile would have been nice on other days reception staff were welcoming and provided tips on places to eat locally pool is outdoors and slightly away from the actual hotel access through car park breakfast was average layout was odd you were criss crossing the area and other guests to get things ie plates for toast on left side of room toasters on right toasters were only 4 slices not the normal industrial belt drive so we all had to wait for each otherâs toast to pop hotel has a deal with a taxihirer car company 6500 us flat rate to lax air port good rate but the taxi;4
i think the hotel was good for its price nice clean room bathroom and had comfortable beds its was quiet during the nights except for one saturday night when it seem like a jazzclub of some sort was open the tv in our room barely worked and wasnt much to enjoy the hotel is alittle off but its very close to central park which was a delight when you left the hotel in the morning there is a subwaystation not far from the hotel3blocks which takes you to times square in 10min going alot with the subway i found it very easy to travel with cleaner cars then you expect and wasnt any problems in the cars so to conclusion its an easy but good hotel for its price is located in a quiet neighbourhood and it takes you only 10min with subways to get you downtown;4
this hotel is located in a 110 year old building its been updated but its still a bit old fashioned in a funky sort of way there are two kinds of accommodations rooms that share a common bathroomshower facility on the same floor and captains quarters that have their own bathroom were past the time in our lives when roughing it appeals to us so we stayed in a captains quarters room my only complaint was that the air conditioning wasnt really up to the task and it was a bit warm for me at night my husband was fine however the jane has a lot of action going on especially on the weekend so request a room away from the party room we didnt notice any noise in our room which faced the hudson river on the 5th floor the price was fairly reasonable given;4
stayed one night at midtown west hotel room was small but clean and quiet had a good nights sleep friendly staff including jose and tyriek good location had some concerns after reading some of the reviews but had good stay and would stay again;4
we stayed at this hotel for a quick trip to universal studios the hotel is wonderful its so close to universal you can walk or take the frequent shuttle bus checkin was efficient and parking is expensive but that is standard in the city note that you will be charged additional parking fees after 6pm on the date of checkout the elevators were a little slow but the hotel staff were positioned near the elevators to assist in speeding up the process the service at the hotel was great the food was also really good we enjoyed the continental breakfast cocktails at the pool bar beware a can of coke is 4 at the pool bar and the delicious and cheap gelato at peets in the lobby everything was terrific my only suggestion is for hilton to trade out the double beds for;4
im sure many who have stayed at this hotel will agree hugo is a legend you will meet hugo at breakfast he is efficient courteous genuine about making you feel good in the mornings unlike jezel at the front desk the breakfast is great truly is the hotel has all you need laundry pool ect i liked that the metro is just a few minutes walk so you could get around quiet easily the beds are comfy and the rooms big enough for a family of 4 with 2 queens i researched this hotel thoroughly and found it was the best value for money in la ups to the hollywood hotel on vermont we had a descent stay;4
after the two of us had a bad night at the jazz on the park hostel just one block away we didnt expect much for the 90 bucks we paid per night at the astor but we were very positively surprised nicely located across the street from central park subway station 103rd st just 2 short blocks away modern style very clean and good bathroom the hotel itself doesnt offer many features outside the room the reception is small as the elevator and the hallways but who needs more in nyc the feebased wifi wasnt usable while i staid but everything else was really good for the cheap deal we got 90 usd night seems like a steal for the days after thanksgiving and we were lucky to be at this place but it looks like the hotel is normally much more expansive than this;4
very noisy on the side where lincoln center is located there was construction going on and we should have been warned about this could not sleep at all otherwise great location and good service the gym was closed and that was upsetting room was nice and clean;4
road scholar booked this hotel for me on the initial trip to westminster kennel club show i could not have been happier with the accommodations and the location the room was clean and comfortable and just the right size for my needs the staff was friendly and efficient as well as courteous;4
we stayed from 63073 we arrived at the same moment the president of taiwan arrived we had to wait for security to make sure she was safe the elevators were secured until she was safe the staff handled the checkin quickly they did apologize that the elevators were being repaired and the ones working were limited the rooms were very nice and front desk staff were very attentive the hotel has shuttles to universal and is in walking distance too the hotel has an excellent breakfast universal city walk has great restaurants for lunchdinner that are outside the park we had a great visit;4
i enjoyed my stay at the new yorker very conveniently located near the train station and has subway access just outside i also enjoyed looking through the mini museum they have on the basement level there is a lot of rich history at this hotel and i hope they continue to preserve it in their renovations yes the rooms are small but that is to be expected staying in the heart of nyc my room had a keurig and a mini fridge i saw some reviews saying they didnât have that the room was kind of perpetually damp i think that has more to do with the weather while we staying the paint around the bathroom windows was peeling due to the lack of ventilation in the bathroom i suggest cracking the window open while bathing to help prevent this yes you can open the windows a;4
i had a night in new york city and wanted to visit the new whitney museum built by renzo piano so i wanted to be close to this museum close to public transportation and also not to spend excessively much money i enjoyed my stay at the jane hotel very much as the website shows the rooms are tiny the staff proved very helpful and nice i also enjoyed having breakfast in the cafã© gitane accessible from the hotel lobby;4
as we all know hotels are expensive in nyc however there are a few affordable options including the jane hotel located in greenwich village great little cafes and restaurants in the area they have several room options from shared dorms to suites for us we just needed a place to sleep after touring the city the jane hotel was plenty comfy clean and quiet we were really happy the friendly and informative staff the jane has free bikes to use which we used to get around biking the city is easy and efficient we were close to the hudson which has a beautiful walkingrunningbike path overall great value and great fun;4
great hotel in a great location only issue we had was checking in which was resolved quickly but we found some of the staff were not as polite and welcoming as they were when we stayed with them before;4
i stayed there just last night i travel in a touring band of musicians so finding a simple hotel that delivers space and a few conveniences while on the road is a top priority hollywood hotel is reasonably priced the double bed habitations is plenty of room for two to even four travelers the rooms are clean and well maintained the hotel provides free wifi warning it is very slow but i only needed to shoot off a few emails and a great hot breakfast they have a chef named hugo who makes killer omelets they also have off street parking for 22 which in la can be 40 we roll with a van full of equipment so that amenity was extremely helpful to us overall i would recommend this to anyone wanting a reasonable place to stay not too far from the downtown;4
stayed for 3 nights room was clean and ample for 2 adults bed was very comfortable but creaked a little when we turned over only 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel were provided but we asked for more and they quickly obliged we opted for full breakfast which was buffet style plenty of choice and delicious both check in and check out were smooth and the luggage was kept in a secure room until we were ready to travel home staff were friendly and approachable and very attentive;4
great hotel good beds very helpfull people and very nice ali was a great help to us and very nice the location is very good just at time squar and a small walk away from central park very good neighbourhood def coming back;4
this hotel is a great place for people wanting a base for their sightseeing trip to new york the hotel is a 5 minute walk to the subway and the hudson river is across the road yes the rooms are small but theyre more than adequate for sleeping and dressing in and have the essential conveniences and great character the shared bathrooms are kept clean if your in new york to be out and about this hotel is perfect as with most inhouse restaurants the janes is slightly more expensive than the normal but thats to be expected the staff are friendly and helpful i enjoyed my stay here its not perfect but then i wasnt looking for perfect if you want clean warm and inviting for a good price you cant go far wrong;4
the new yorker is right on the edge of the theater district but has good subway access so times square is one stop away room was clean although tight good shower fitness and business centers were accessible and not overly crowded wed stay there again usual green complaint yes the hotel wants to appear to be green and not change sheets or towels to save water but the housekeeping staff fears the supervisor inspection so regardless of what the guest wants the sheets and towels still get changed daily we solve this by hanging the do not disturb sign all day;4
all in all we were really happy with this hotel we walked up and received a pretty good rate we booked an executive level room note there is nothing special about these rooms apart from a high level there is no club lounge you get breakfast vouchers but they put you in a room next to the restaurant you can pay extra to upgrade to the main restaurant i found this whole thing weird the room was great great size and we had an excellent view down to universal studios with la to the right tv was old but watched very little beds and pillows were super comfortable pool area was pretty good and almost empty 5 min walk across to universal with plenty of choice of dining;4
the rooms are the size of a closet and theres shared bathrooms on each floor but you will hardly ever run into someone in the bathroom the showers are private with locking doors and they give you your own slippers and bath robe the locations excellent and free bike rental is great try to get a room high up since their lounge bar is popular fridaysat nights;4
the hyatt regency lax was easy to find and accessible from the freeway i had a wonderful room for a business meeting and staff was wonderful i did have a slight issue with valet they had issue with me parking in the front to check in also be sure to check credit card charges as i did have an additional charge made in error that they did clear up but had i not caught i most likely would have been left with that charge i did enjoy my stay;4
good location great breakfast very friendly and dedicated staff hugo and the latino women prepare wonderful omelette scrambled eggs and waffles for breakfast definitely a good place to stay only nã©gative point the parking of the hã´tel is really expensive but you can park around for free if you care about the signs in the street;4
rooms are a little small and bathroom tiny but its expected in new york fast and friendly check in tick tock diner great for breakfast and cake brilliant location beside madison square gardens and a few minutes walk from macys we had a view of the empire state building from our room planning to revisit soon;4
rooms are small but very comfortable negative wifi for a charge positive great location lots of items in the room to purchase for a high charge too excessive my room didnt have a remote for the tv would have been nice;4
very near to the airport huge and spacious property good food and clean roomsthis was my second time staying at the hotel staff is very good i love the bar but needs more staff because it gets crowdedover all the hotel is good;4
really enjoyed our stay at the empire it was a lovely hotel with great staff and for new york decent value for money it was really well placed with 2 subway stops nearby and really close to central park the rooms are small by us standards and getting bags for three people in was a bit of a squeeze but the rooms are not for hanging out in itâs not that kind of hotel its a great base for a visit to the city the rooms are very clean the beds are comfy and despite our window being on broadway relatively noise free if you are tall though you may want to make sure you check out the size of the beds im sure if you are over 2 meters your feet would stick out of the queen size the lobby and its bar are brilliant the wifi is free the lobby so it was a really relaxing place;4
location was great and the office personnel made us feel like family thanks folks the rooms arent spacious and full of amenities we dont need but we didnt come to nyc to sit in our room the people at the front desk always led us in the right direction to explore this section of the city;4
just stayed for 3 nights on our tour of the us fantastic hotel with the nicest staff we met on this trip universal studios only short walk from hotel family friendly with a pool would have given 5 stars but food very expensive overall excellent hotel with terrific staff;4
we booked our night here as we were laying over on our way to philadelphia what a treat my husband and i were upgraded to a captains cabin despite only booking the double bunk room after a long flight we decided to have dinner in the restaurant the food was well priced and the service was excellent the room itself was spacious and spotlessly clean though finding the rooms can be a little confusing as the halls are catacomb like reviews i read spoke about a rooftop bar however its only open for functions there is a downstairs barclub which at about 3am i was woken to the soft pounding of music slightly annoying but not so disturbing i couldnt get back to sleep the bathrooms are well appointed with large deep bathtubs so deep they may be a problem for some;4
stayed 3 nites on a family vacation 2 double bed room was cramped but serviceable for our needs 12th floor pool deck is great for chillaxing after a long day at the museums central park lincoln center the met mad all walking or a cheap cab ride away hotel lobby was funky but worn rooms were clean and not too noisy;4
ive been staying at the empire hotel for years i love the location the boutique feel of the rooms and the really nice desk staff and i have always found that the rates are very good i usually opt for the least expensive room and it is very small but it has everything that i need i imagine it would be tight for two but stillit is pretty and compact shutting the bathroom door can be tricky because the room is so small be forewarned if you order a cocktail in the bar in the lobby be prepared for an exorbitant price two years ago my martini was 20 i cant imagine what it is now you can luck out and get a view of lincoln center so pretty at night;4
for an older hotel we had a great stay it is right downtown and the beds are excellent the room size was ample compared to newer hotels we have stayed in watch out for the internet and gym they charge you;4
i stayed here for 4 nights it was clean and comfortable cons at night the area around the hotel is quite ghetto and it doesnt feel safe to be able to walk around the front desk staff were a little bit difficult and i didnt realise that parking would cost 25 dollars a night finding parking around the area was a nightmare pros the rooms were clean and the service was good the kitchen staff were exemplary particularly sonia and elvira they provided great polite service with a smile and cooked a great breakfast on a daily basis;4
this is my second time staying at the empire for some reason i like it it has a great vibe it is a darker hotel that almost feels somewhat steampunkish the overall look and feel of it is what mostly attracts me the rooftop cocktail lounge is nice but it gets very busy as does the lobby bar the lobby can get incredibly loud with large groups of younger people having drinks rooms are very small and this is where the biggest shortcoming of the hotel is space in ny comes at a premium so it is somewhat expected but they are tiny i was alone and had a suit case and a carry one that is enough to make it feel crowded you cant sit on the toilet without closing the door that kind of cramped there is no room service so you either have to eat at the cocktail lounge;4
my wife and i gave our kids a trip to nyc for christmas and we went this week ma school vacation week we had a great time and the staff at the new yorker helped with that the stay was great rooms are clean and comfortable and the price was right the rooms are small but most rooms are in the city the only issue we had was on our check out day we received a call at 1100 asking why we hadnt left yet checkout is at noon apparently we were checked out erroneously the clerk on the phone was a bit rude about this situation but it was rectified and all was good in the end highly recommend this hotel;4
there are many reviews of this property and having been there in october of 2022 i can say that the property is nice very well maintained and at a great location we went to a concert at the greek theater and it was perfect to get a quick uber to the venue the property is clean and secure the pool is nice but has no jacuzzi noise was not a problem the room was big well appointed and freshly painted the refrigerator did not work but it made no difference to us the staff we encountered were very nice there is no food served in spite of what the web site might say;4
our experience at the new yorker was ok the price was good for manhattan great location right next to penn station elevators were a bit slow but not terrible the pressure of the water at the 20th floor was so strong and the water so hot that after walking all day it was wonderful to be able to take a bath;4
if you are visiting the universal studios then you probably found the right hotel to stay at it is just a 9 minute shuttle ride from the studios and the hotel provides that with their compliments all day the staff are very helpful breakfast was above average for a buffet but there are plenty of choices;4
we stayed at the hilton for 1 night all employees were very nice and said hello when you walked by rooms were very clean and the bed was very comfy hung out with miley cyrus in the hot tub overall you pay a little more but it was a short walk to universal studios and citywalk the parking fee is 1700;4
the rooms were a good size and clean the view of the empire state building from the window was amazing and the museum in the basement of the hotel was excellent and free to get in would stay there again;4
old and stylish good location very friendly staff clean good for a rest but not work rooms are small a bid overpriced many spots in walking distance close to the subway good diners type restaurant;4
located right in the heart of nyc and steps away from penn station and right in front of macys this hotel is a very good option to stay great view of the empire state building you can walk to a lot of places and you can find coffee shops and restaurants in walking distance;4
the hilton universal city is the closest hotel to universal studios and so is a popular choice for many visiting families after a three night stay here are my comments 1 the front desk staff is fabulous i was not charged for early checkin and was given a password for wifi i was greeted with a smile and given tips to enhance my stay 2 there is an issue with the water at one point no water came out of the faucets for several minutes for the rest of the stay the water was lukewarm and smelled like sulfur 3 we had a corner room it was small but had a fantastic view of the park 4 the sofa bed was terrible the mattress was very thin and groaned and creaked each time my child moved during the night 5 there is a shuttle that runs between the hilton;4
its neither pretty nor spectacular but if you plan on going to the universal studios and city this is a great place to stay for 2 or 3 nights you can just walk over everything else is hilton standard sunday brunch however is remarkable it is truly an oppulent feast and attracts a lot of local residents;4
i believe that the hotel is the most convenient place if you came from out of town to enjoy the met production or came to see a ballet listen to a classical music or anything else the lincoln place has to offer we liked the hotel the service was friendly the room good we didnt have problems with amenities in the room but it was a bit cold as we stayed just one night we didnt have time to deal with that the hotel charges for the internet inside the rooms 10 per device which is quite ridiculous nowadays but there is free wifi in the common areas the breakfast is overpriced we didnt have time to explore their bar upstairs overall we were happy with our choice and a possibility to attend the opera by just crossing the street and we came when the snow was quite;4
large and clean rooms comfortable beds and a couple of minutes of a walk to universal studios everything works as you would expect the pool area looked nice we didnt test it though would recommend easily;4
the best asset of this hotel is its location it is located between the lincoln center and columbus circle metro stops which makes getting around very convenient a citi bike rack is also located right in front of the hotel hotel was reasonably priced as we booked a few months in advance with the nonrefundable rate and fbsave15 code the hotel stored our luggage both on our day of arrival and departure our biggest complaint was that the wifi was not free im not sure if this is standard in nyc but it was certainly annoying they also charged me for something from the hotel fridge which we did not use but removed the charge when i asked about it upon check out i saw another reviewer mention this so be sure to review any charges before departing overall a nice hotel;4
the good value excellent bang for your buck location 3 blocks from central park subway station across the street 24 hr pharmacy next door good food across the street and in surrounding streets quiet safe neighborhood service friendly and helpful staff clean the bad location if you want to walk to major manhattan attractions except central park this is not the best choice outdated the property and rooms are old but well kept old tv in room very few electric plugs bed too soft and in need of replacement in my opinion i had a very good experience at this hotel the good overweight the bad by far i definitely recommend it;4
late review i very much enjoyed my stay at the jane hotel room was clean shared bathrooms were also very clean i am a single female traveled alone and felt very safe every staff member i was in contact with was professional and helpful i stayed five days four nights and did not have any negative issues the only reason i am not giving five stars is because the beds are a little uncomfortable other than needing better mattresses this is the place to stay if you want to save money while in nyc;4
just got back from a 4 day3 night trip to nyc and my first stay at the days hotel and the upper west side im a frequent ny visitor and the uws is my new favorite base of operations its literally a 100 yards out the hotels door to the 123 subway station and you can connect to anywhere in the city from there its also easy to take subwaybus to and from lga to the days hotel no need to take a cab or car service the days hotel is old with a little patina on it but was a great place to spend my evenings i would call my room on the 6th floor refreshed with a newly updated bathroom while the rest of the rooms furnishings were kind of dated but homey my queen room was pretty big by manhattan standards and although my window faced the building next door the upside;4
this hotel has got all you need close to main attractions rooms are smart and big enough nice place to eat on sight plenty of lifts for high floors and a nice artdeco appearance would recommend this hotel;4
love the location food room and amenities and staff i only have two concerns 1st i tried to call the hotel several times to get information and no one ever answered the phone 2nd although my room was lovely there was something wrong with the air conditioner and it rattled and banged on and off all night the first night i didnt know what it was i thought that i was above a generator second night i called front desk and night manager came up with engineer who said it was ac and it would be fixed but it wasnt i didnt really sleep for 3 days but other than that i was in nyc;4
the front desk staff is great especially stewart the subway is close and hollywood is the first stop going toward union station so thats easy theres a less expensive sushi restaurant just a block or two down vine from the expensive one at hollywood and vine the second subway stop the buffet at the hotel is yummy its great to be able to walk to universal;4
this this is definitely your place ive stayed there on three separate occasions and i must say that the bad reviews on here are unfair chances are if youre looking at hostels then you know that they arent like hotels if you compare hotel riverside with the hilton then of course things will be unbalanced but this a hostel nothing more or less shared bathroom and small rooms but things are clean its quiet you get a good nights rest and the price is affordable ive never seen or felt any bed bugs during my stay the bathrooms were always empty when i needed and front desk people are nice and personally walk you to your room ill continue to stay there when i visit because im always on a budget for the price things are pretty nice;4
if you need a hotel without the bells and whistles this is the hotel for you the breakfast is nice downstairs there is a chef who will cook for you the rooms are nothing to write home about but if you just need somewhere to stay it is good the hotel is old but it is like stay at your mums house not your grandmas;4
for a few years now i have been working with michelene in the sales department at the empire on rooms for our staff as producers of mercedesbenz fashion week new york she has been so helpful in making sure we are taken care of and we know we will never have a problem when we are in her hands more recently i was assisted by pasquale at the front desk and he was such a relief during such a stressful time he worked with us on getting our guests checked in even from a distance as it was impossible for us to get everyone there at the same time the team was and continues to be a pleasure to work with;4
the hotel is very clean facilities are great aside from the washing machine which you have to pay and cant use without coins for a tourist like us would be an issue as you need to have lots of coins to use itthe staff are of great helpanyway specially cecille who is very friendly and accomodating and will definitely help you with anything excellent staff service;4
i chose this hotel because of its relative proximity to the greek theatre in very nice griffith park about 2 12 miles away up a moderate incline for last part of the walk and iâm very glad i did hotel is clean with a friendly very helpful staff very comfortable but slightly small rooms nice breakfast immediate area is somewhat rundown with some homeless people but quickly changes heading north to a very nice area with lots of nice restaurants and trees hiking in griffith park is excellent try starfish sushi for excellent japanese food and electric lotus for excellent indian cuisine both just north of hollywood blvd hotel has a somewhat funky charming âold hollywoodâ feel appearance highly recommended;4
for a short stay in la we chose this property staff were helpful and the room was good and clean breakfast was included and set us up for the day the la metro is just a short walk which proved easy for a visit to the science centre;4
this hotel was super close to the airport with a shuttle to conveniently take you to and from lax the inside lobby as well as the rooms are very modern chic and minimalist but with all the necessary amenities the best part however was the customer service checkin was super quick and easy and every staff person i encountered said hello and was super helpful if i ever need to stay near the airport again i would definitely choose the hyatt regency;4
the staff at the ameritania were very helpful and more than nice the barrestaurant area was small and we didnt take advantage of it much so not a lot to comment on that there is free infused water in the lobby as well which was a nice touch our room was very spacious corner unit and clean the free wifi made planning our next days adventure a bit easier three elevators make getting in and out of the building a breeze the central location of the hotel is what sold us right across from a subway entrance and next to the ed sullivan theater stephen colbert show steps from a ton of broadway shows this was an excellent hotel for the price;4
the hotel itself was cute and charming it had that old hollywood appeal the staff was very nice and accomadting i didnt like the area around it though there was a lot of homeless people on the sidewalks so i didnt feel that safe walking outside but inside i felt safe;4
i feel that people that give a poor review for this hotel were somehow expecting a five star hotel for the price paid it was good value all of the hotel staff i encountered were friendly and welcoming breakfast was great for this price point one downside was the hotel is not within walking distance of attractions but because the metro was so close getting around was easy we faced the courtyard on the third floor and it was very quiet the thing that prevented me from goving it 5 stars was the cleanliness and condition of the bathroom it seemed like the bed area of the room was updated but the bathroom was left for another day overall great value though and i would stay here again;4
amazing location premier plus room worth the extra cash very clean reasonably quiet friendly housekeeping staff but sadly checkin was chaotic self serve machines were not working properly staff had to break off half way through checkin to do other things two separate queuesfor the manned checkin meant that 3 parties arriving after me were checked in first simply because the person serving them was quicker needs more organization signage;4
hotel was everything i expected its old but well kept nice barrestaurant staff was friendly and very helpful the location is good because its far enough outside of hollywood where you dont get the crazies also its right outside universal studios and the universal walk is there as well has many options for food and drinks its also right off of the highways so getting onoff was very convienient;4
the stay was tremendous the hotel is within walking distance of so many attractions in nyc and has a subway station right in front of the building so travel to other areasattractions is a breeze as long as you can navigate the subway the room was very nice a little out dated but still enjoyable only draw back is the lack of heat or vents in the bathroom and old windows we had to have the heat turned up in the 80s just to have the room feel comfortable due to the drafty windows restaurants in the hotel lobby were amazing staff seemed nice but overbearing at times they check on you if you leave your do not disturb sign on the door which defeats the purpose of the do not disturb sign all in all a good stay but pricey for what you get;4
the hotel is well located just steps away from penn station and a few blocks from time square friendly staff and clean rooms thats all i need when it comes to a place i want to stay also just 5 blocks away from the edge;4
this is my 3rd time here the staff delivers a very hi level of service in every regard without exception i was even impressed that the fitness room is very well cared for and cleaned unusual the challenge here is that this hotel is probably 4045 years old and its age shows we were here two years ago and the elevator bank was being renovated the elevator bank is still being renovated however they devote two staff people to directing traffic to help people in and out quickly and they even have one person operating the elevator what a throwback there is a memo on the desk in our room warning that you better leave extra time due to likely elevator delays so this is clearly not a plus several times there was no room for people on lower floors to get on another;4
i just returned from a weekend in nyc with 3 teenagers to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday and stayed at the empire the lobby is beautiful and the location is great we had been upgraded to a deluxe double and were told it had a beautiful view of lincoln center when we got to our room we had no view and the set up of the room was very strange with a column in the middle of the room i called down and was told that we could switch rooms tomorrow but nothing was available that night i was fine with that until i saw how small the bathroom was i think it is quite possibly the smallest bathroom i have ever seen in a hotel this was a little bit of a problem with three teens also the showers do not have a door so the water tends to spray out of the shower and all over the;4
we had a nice stay at the empire hotel on short notice the empire is in a great location right next to lincoln center and is convenient for getting to attractions and subway lines the front desk attendant pasquale was very friendly and made us feel welcome right from the start we found the hotel to be very clean and comfortable though the rooms are small but that is every hotel room in nyc so i wasnt shocked overall a great stay;4
we stayed here just this week for three nights and had a great time the hotel is in a great location to many of nyc key sites and several awesome places to eat just blocks away from times square rockefeller center central park and other key locations makes it a good choice for anyone wanting to visit nyc the room was plenty large for the 2 of us the bathroom was modern with awesome water pressure and great fixtures the rain showerhead was sweet the bed was a little soft for our liking but not uncomfortable by any means typical nyc noises were noticed but again nothing that was annoying or bothered us at all the roomhotel decor is a modern mix of colors and textures that make it fun compared to some of the often times stale chain hotels id asked the hotel to;4
the empires terrifically located five minutes from columbus circle five minutes from central park and about ten minutes from fifth and five minutes from the amc imax cinema the staff and friendly and courteous and the hotel is nicely decorated the room is fine if basic wifi is expensive its 70 for a week which applies for only one device so youre probably putting a us sim card in your phone if you need directions to sights in ny and the bar and snacks in the room are heinously overpriced but thats to be expected in a hotel but the hotel itself is fantastic in terms of location staff and sleep quality i couldnt really have asked for more;4
first the problem we had during our stay some of our belongings were missing not a lot of value but we decided to call security in less than 5 minutes a manager came to our room he was very professional asked a lot of questions he asked he same questions many times i am sure he was double checking our story he believed us so he said probably it was not necessary to check our belongings but we agreed it was the best thing to do we start opening our luggage and we end up finding everything it was our mistake we were all happy that the was not issue he was a real professional we found the most of the staff was very courteous now for the rest of the hotel it is located in the fashion district very close to msg and subway the hotel is art deco and a little old they;4
on the whole i have to give this a very good rooms are spacious for new york although we did get an upgrade the bathroom was tiny though and very dated the heating took a while to master we ate breakfast daily in the diner downstairs which was good reception staff really pleasant and helpful concierge and door staff were typical new yorkers;4
itâs located a good 10 mins from times square but bang next door to madison square gardens and penn st station when i was getting prices it was always at the cheaper end of the spectrum but when i went to visit i was quite impressed by the decor i believe that they are renovating rooms doing 2 floors at a time so you need to make sure you ask for one of those;4
i wasnt to sure about the hotel but i was pleasantly surprised it is a couple of blocks from hollywood walk of fame and typical tourist places the mattresses are dreamy the only thing that i found wrong was that there was one tiny shelf in the shower to hold my bottles it could have used another shelf or a bigger one other than that we really enjoyed our stay if you dont want to park on the street the parking is 2400 a day we paid it because i didnt want to leave a rental car on the street great place to stay and a reasonable price for los angeles;4
i will be staying at this hotel for the 3rd time it is very clean a little dated but i have never seen anything that would raise a red flag never seen a bug or anything disgusting the only thing that didnt earn them excellent is do the ancient elevators that take forever and hold 5 people right across the street is this amazing affordable cafe best cupcakes ever;4
the hostel is 5 mn walk away from the subway and not far from downtown where you can find many stores restaurants and bars the guesthome were nice the room are very clean and very brighted the negative view is about showers because you cant put your clothes anywhere and these are mixted showers i dont really agreed with that even there is video camera outside;4
days inn hotel new york broadway was once grander notice the checkers marble lobby where boorish tourists now straddle the couches and the polished brass mail chute the internet of its day which is now largely ignored a shadow of its former grand as it may be the hotel offers a convenient midtown location and surprisingly roomy accommodations service was an expected from such establishment sleep was average due to street noise but at 160 a night after aaa discount and including decent internet signal it was a bargain and the mail we sent from the chute made it all the way across the oceans;4
hotel was clean and comfortable staff were very helpful especially when i left an item in the safe and had to have it posted to me quickly to our next hotel on our trip ð³ the only downside was there were no teacoffee making facilities in the room other than that would definitely recommend and would stay again;4
i stayed at the empire hotel for 5 nights for work and then another 5 nights with my husband on holidays our room for the entire stay was the superior king room and work paid for breakfast during the first 5 days i have been to ny before and know rooms are small but i was still disappointed that our upgraded superior king room was so small especially the bathroom was extremely tiny breakfast is not worth the cost at the hotel i ate there for the first 5 days as work had already paid for it but on the 5 days while staying for pleasure there are plenty of alternative options close by another couple joined us holidaying and they upgraded their room to a suite the suite was fantastic and if you can afford the extra s and are staying in ny for a week then the extra room is;4
we stayed at the new yorker 13th dec to 17th dec checkin was a smooth process with friendly staff a security deposit was taken and we didnât have to pay the facilities fee as we booked with virgin holidays if you are looking for a reasonably priced accommodation look no further than here it doesnât have the wow factor but it does have comfy beds and clean rooms with great housekeeping;4
25 valet and crummy self parking lot is not a good set up pool is nice and staff is excellent food options are current rooms are nice and current updated and style and food some airport noise but windows are double pained to cut noise;4
we stayed there to be close to universal studio it is a 5 min walk there they do have a shuttle which seems meaningless rooms are of a good size for a family of four our room had an excellent view of the city from the 15th floor room service was fast and relatively cheap the breakfast buffet was very good parking with inout is easy they had some issues with their elevators which resulted in a bit of a wait sometimes i recommend this for universal and warner brothers is a short drive away;4
our trip to the usa started and ended in la we stayed at the hilton 4 nights then 3 nights on return so we got a good feel for the place hotel the rooms were clean and above average with adequate amounts of space so i didnt feel claustrophobic and we got a view of the daily traffic outside the window service we found the service was excellent nothing was too hard for the staff at reception the hotel managers were kind and helpful we wanted to eat cereal in our rooms every morning as we would be eating out for lunch and dinner daily and we requested a little fridge as there was none other than the bar fridge which we said we did not want access to the hotel manager had a small fridge sent up right away which was very convenient for daily milk storage all in all;4
decent downtown hotel with adequate room but a small bathroom staff was very accommodating and helpful 24 hour diner on premises with 24 hour breakfast and good food two other restaurants as well i would recommend the diner but not the restaurant on the main level only had drinks in the 3rd location so no comment great pizza just down the street new york pizza supreme starbucks across the street;4
loved the hotel very modern front desk and door people were amazing elevators are ok slightly slow but there are 3 of them what was disappointing was the size of the standard room theres about one foot of space between the end of the bed and the dressertv 15 feet between the bed and the wall standard room doesnt have a tub but the shower is very adequate a great plus the windows open a down there are no screens on the window;4
great location great corporate rates amazing roomsbed great views its an easy walk across the street to universal city my room generally has views of all the shows in the park restaurants are nearby and very easy highway access this is my hotel of choice when im in la for business;4
the room was large and nice it was so good to find a room at the last minute this hotel is not far from the airporti was happy with everything i was able to shuttle back to the airport in not time;4
the hotel has shuttle bus to universal studio every 15 mins which is a very good convenience it takes only 5 mins to universal studio the room is very clean checking in and out on app is fast and easy;4
firstly the location of this hotel is brilliant and really one of the best areas of new york around the corner you have bars restaurants the high line and streets you can spend hours walking around i will get the negatives out of the way first housekeeping probably the worst housekeeping ive ever had and we travel a lot effort was minimal first night they didnt service the room until 6pm then didnt give us toilet paper which we had run out of didnt empty the full bins etc our soaps and shampoos were not refilled until day 5 of our 7 day stay ok so nothing major but disappointing especially giving we were still paying a good amount of money for our stay there we knew from reviews rooms were not big we had a captains cabin on the third floor the;4
stayed here with three kids 1512 6 so we could visit universal studios picked it based on previous reviews of walking distance to front gate about a 10 minute walk even for my 6 year old room was clean eve nsmelled clean and roomy with comfy beds very quiet and hardly heard anybody else on our floor the only down side was the food restaraunts are geared more to adults and not a typical kid the bonus was citywalk is right there so able to have many choices from fast food to more sit down type nicer places hotel does offer a shuttle to universal also was well worth the money and priced comparable to other hotels that were in the neighborhood but this one being the closest is daily hotel parking fee too;4
room is modern barn door bathroom does not have a lock or way to secure it for privacy system allowed me to add an early check in to my reservation the night before when i arrived the desk person told me that housekeeping had just arrived and it would be another hour for my room an hour after that i went back to the desk and micci was able to place me in a cleaned room with the needed configuration our last hiccup was the bell person went to lunch and our luggage delivery was delayed it was delivered as soon as he returned without hesitation all of these were annoyances although i paid an extra 85 to wait around for an early check in and eat in the lobby this was nearly half the cost of the actual room i would stay again;4
i stayed at this hotel in early august 2016 i had one of the bunk bed rooms the room is quite narrow and there is not room for 2 people to move around at the same time even though they tell you about the size online it is still a shock to see it in person but the rooms have a nautical charm i didnt go to the nightclub or restaurant by the hotel so i cannot comment on that this review is solely about the hotel the hotel is in a safe neighborhood and is very reasonably priced compared to others in that area you have a bit of a walk to get to a bus stop or a train station though it is not super close but it is of course doable if youre coming to new york you have got to get used to hoofing it anyway the rooms were clean the shared bathroomstoilets were always;4
very good hotel close to everything has restaurants to eat and bar to grab drinks great 24hr dinerright in the middle of times square perfect for broadway shows 1 block away close to shopping not far from central park;4
was concerned because of of prior negative ratings but the hotel was clean and nice and staff were helpful room was a decent size for nyc there was no tv remotes but they brought us one right away did not know until the morning that the shower was broken it was usable but the water just sprayed out of everywhere instead of just the shower hear we left so unsure how or if it got fixed i prepaid so the price was decent te location of the hotel was perfect for us and we would try it again if back in that area;4
such a great location and bargain needs some attentiona window in my room by the bed leaked and it was cold cold coldi asked for an extra blanketnever came the heat wasnât on either the doormen were just lovelythoughtful and helpful;4
my wife and two children stayed at this hotel for four nights to attend a family function and do a little tourist stuff the rooms are clean and comfortable and the location is convenient for most la attractions notwithstanding the traffic the restaurant is decent and breakfast buffet is plentiful people are friendly and helpful as well only two complaints i 22day to park the car is outrageous and ii housekeeping needs to get their act together to clean rooms earlier in the day two of my four days the room was still not cleaned when we returned to the room midlate afternoon if this is important to you be sure to request that housekeeping come early;4
i am humble so i will say it is above averagestaff were very helpful and had a good 3 days corner king room next to the gym would go there again not every1 is happy as i have read on trip advisor but every1 has good days and bad days but as i said would recommend to couples and families;4
we recently spent 3 nights at this hilton check in was quick i have the app and had actually checked in online and picked the room i wanted and that is what we got our room was on the 18th floor with nice views of the hollywood hills we had 2 queens and the room was very large for us all to spread out basic decor but very clean all staff encountered were extremely friendly and helpful there is a shuttle that will take you to universal studios and backbut we actually opted to walk as it was maybe a 10 minute walk at most we slept great no sounds at all the only slight issue was with the elevators as they are currently repairing them but they had a notice posted in the room so we planned accordingly we really enjoyed everything about this hotel and would;4
location is perfect for walking to times square rockefeller center and most theaters subway stations close to the hotel make visiting central park the met and 911 museum are an easy subway ride lots of eating options from steakhouses to street vendors are in close proximity our only issue was housekeeping getting 2 washcloths 2 people in the room daily was an issue and one day she left her used coffee cup in our room jeff the doorman was fabulous he took care of our luggage arranged for our return car to jfk provided easy to follow directions and always had a smile and greeting i would stay here again;4
stayed for 5 days with friends great location clean rooms size of room was what you would expect in manhattan friendly courteous staff nice stay for the price very comfortable and convenient;4
room for value was good pillows too soft elevators slow great location to central park the subway and the lincoln center i would stay again and definitely use the rooftop restaurant and bar next time a bit chilly in april;4
hotel close to penn station and the highline not to far away room had a good view of the empire state building staff attentative room cleaned each day to a high stadard beds comfy overall the hotel did what we needed it to do;4
if it werent for a miscommunication issue at front desk about early check in time and costs we would of rated our stay a 5 but overall great hotel with a delicious breakfast made to order omelets we definitely enjoy our stay;4
rooms are small with older facilities and minimal lighting beds are good and firm though which is welcome after the long days of walking the hotel is directly above ace subway lines and allows easy access updowntown there are also convenient eateries downstairs with a casual diner option and a slightly more upscale italianstyle restaurant;4
for the hotel class and price this hotel is not bad at all the bed is big and very comfy and room size bigger than expected bathroom was big but basic the power of the shower was very good location was very good at the lincoln center near the famous julliard school and columbus circle not far from times square and central park without the traffic and noise you find along times square staff were friendly and helpful they will make you feel comfortable staying there yes it probably could do with new carpet but it was clean negatiives 1 free wifi only in the lobby however we managed to connect to lincoln center wifi free from our room 2 no complimentary tea bags or bottled water you have to pay for everything and they are quite expensive a convenient;4
had a great view of the city from my room the staff is very friendly and helpful if you want 2 bathrooms in your suite you need to ask for it upon arrival or during the reservation period 1 block from penn station which was great close to time square and other sites;4
exterior reflective glass is timeless but the rooms must have been recently remodeled and they were remodeling the lobby while we were there walking distance to universal studios good breakfast but nonplussed by the 10 surcharge for diamond members;4
great location to all points of interest just one metro stop away from the heart of hollywood universal studios and theme park citywalk and the metro are all within walking distance from the hotel great for first time visitors to la which we were fabulous breakfast buffet great pool and well appointed rooms with great views of the hollywood hills staff at every level were courteous and very helpful what i like best about this hotel is its central location we did have a billing issue which eventually was corrected overall our stay was very good i would stay here again because of the convenient location;4
our flight got into lax at midnight so it was nice that we didnt have to travel much further after a very long day its just a short shuttle ride from the terminal to the hotel after a long day of travel we were ready to go to bed unfortunately the room didnt have soap available so we had to wait a while before we could properly wash our hands we had breakfast in the dining room the next morning which was fine if i had to stay overnight at an airport hotel i would look elsewhere before staying here again;4
we recently stated at the empire hotel and our teenager left her new iphone at the hotelt we realized it may have been lost at the hotel about 7 days later and called security had the phone and worked with us to ship it out to us right away thank you to the hotel location couldnt be more perfect its right near lincoln center and fordham university prime location thank you vaughn and lionel for your help we really appreciate it;4
this hotel was a great location we enjoyed the short walk to central park and shopping the rooms are rather small so we got a king suite which was great the staff was helpful and friendly the hotel was clean and quiet;4
the jane is in a perfect location if you love to shop and hang out at hipster bars and restaurants also right next to the waterfront with a path perfect for running the two of us 30 somethings shared a cabin room floor space exactly large enough to sit one suitcase down and stand next to it which was fine since we only slept a few hours both nights we stayed the shared bathrooms were not very clean and we have a high tolerance for dirty shared facilities this is no place for a claustrophobic within 12 mile is bleecker st main subway lines path and amazing dining for the price cant be beat but next time we will pony up for a private bath;4
this is of course an ideal hotel for business meetings in studio city and for universal studios it is dated not stylish but the management is highly professional when it comes to every single details of service making an effort i used the hhonor app checkin and asked for complimentary items to wait for me in the room toothpaste extra pillows etc and this is so convenient the breakfast is super rich when you get a coupon for complimentary continental breakfast if you are a hilton gold member or if it is included in your reservation you can add just 10 and get to full rich breakfast value of 28 and it is really good;4
great deal at a good clean hotel mattresses were comfortable and we had a fantastic view of downtown and the park staff was very friendly only negatives tiny sink that was impossible to wash your face in elevator broke on the day we left and we were on the 10th floor also they ordered one of their cars to take us to the airport instead of a taxi and we paid twice as much but overall what a find i hope they stay affordable;4
hubby and i spent five daysnights at ameritania in august 2017 and we enjoyed our time there pros 1 the bathroom was small but well appointed it had one of the best showers of any hotel weve visited the shampoo shower gel and soap were fantastic too 2 we enjoyed the location 54th and broadway we walked to both broadway shows restaurants central park and columbus circle there were plenty of subway stations to choose from too 3 the room was small as i would expect most hotel rooms are in nyc but it had everything we needed after long days of sightseeing 4 it was quiet we stayed on the 10th floor away from broadway and 54th we didnt have a spectacular view but we did sleep well 5 all of the staff that we dealt with were polite and;4
location location locationthe new yorker is truly in the heart of ny city located in walking distance from madison square garden penn station broadway and times square just a few miles from at least a dozen other world recognized tourist attractions;4
we stayed 4 nights and despite being on the street side slept like babies the whole night through the bed was super comfy and the room temps felt cool and perfect for sleeping the main room seemed clean enough but the bathroom cleanliness was questionablehousekeeping staff very polite hotel staff must not have heard of customer service 3 floors 3 desanti water vending machines and not a single bottle of water available staff advise convenience store just a couple of minutes away we could go there for water this at 1100pm not impressed the breakfast however was a redeeming factor if hugo could just be a bit respectful seemed more interested in diddling around behind the breakfast bar rather than making omlette but once made it was very good the;4
the room was clean the hotel is very close to subway access to get to the city it was small but enough for when you come tired from th city staff is very very friendly quiet to sleep at night i would recommend it for a night or two;4
overall experience good stayed close to universal was clean meals were extremely pricey especially given that city walk was across the street shuttle to universal was on time with little wait time;4
over all the staff is very helpfull except for one front desk staff who is very rude and really has not profile to work in hospitality business the bar staff is really friendly and kind bell men also helps a lot the room size king bed is great for manhattam average rooms the bed confort is a plus;4
superior hotel in terms of cleanliness and staff location is great for lax access but dining outside of the hotels themselves is a healthy walk or drive paid parking behind hotel in private garage is super convenient shuttle to lax a bonus nice room remarkable quiet despite being right at entrance to lax value for what i paid was exceptional i probably would stay elsewhere if being right next to lax wasnt a consideration just because of distance to dining and attractions still a great hotel;4
this was my second stay at the jane last time i gave it four stars and when it came to writing this review i looked at others and noticed a pattern lots of ravesbut mostly all only four stars why not five why indeed its a great location and the price is fine and its clean as i noted in my earlier review cant ask for too much as this price right but the fact that it is reasonably priced doesnt mean that ameliorates what is wrong with the jane cheap as it is you are getting a very small room and i knew this from the getgo so it seems to me that the jane shouldmustbe held to the same standards as other places my complaints about the jane which ive sent to management are these 1 noisy noisy noisy doors slamming day and night you will hear;4
we always enjoy staying at the empire as it is convenient for many things we like to doâlincoln center for opera and symphony restaurants we enjoyâfiorello atlantic grillâand shopping what i wish would improve include free wifi and more commodious closets plus room service they are also very parsimonious with the kuerig coffee capsules;4
well its only been a few hours since me and my mum checked in and we will definitely be back the hotel is in a perfect location just a short walk away from central park fifth avenue after arriving we were delighted to discover that our room had been upgraded and its lovely okay its not as big as some but it will do the best thing has to be the service from the front desk ze especially was very helpful when i asked him about how to get to places etc so far so good thank you gossip girl for the inspiration amy;4
this hotel is what you expect of a hilton hotel its clean and modern and the rooms are up to date its as close as you can get to universal studios and i recommend walking to the hotel and not taking the team or shuttles as it ends up taking longer than just crossing the street we were 4 people and the room and it was not cramped at all downside they were fixing the elevators and only 2 function for a fairly large hotel and a very packed lobby so you are waiting for elevators to go up and down quite a bit the hotel does tell you this when you arrive however i went to universal about a year and half ago and stayed at this hotel and they were fixing the elevators and somehow the elevators are still being fixed and no progress has been made plus side there is a petes;4
hotel is center of more or less everything very close to central park and time square car rentals and 5th avenue stuff is helpful guys working in the door were very friendly didnt try breakfast just look and decide to explore out many options close to hotel room was noisy due to street and floor is just 3rd ask to get upper floors room is really small compare to all my travels around the world not easy to walk if you keep open your luggage on the floor;4
front desk was no help at all in trying to plan some tours our room was wonderful they did upgrade us to a corner suit the hotel is starting to look a little tired the bell hops did try and help us with info for tours;4
stayed here for 6 nights 3 adults sharing a twin room easily enough space to accommodate us all checkin was swift and desk staff were really pleasant and helpful the art deco finish is a really pleasant change to most modern hotels where everything is the same the attention to detail here is fabulous even down to the bathroom fixtures and fittings this iconic hotels location is very good close to penn station empire state building and even times square is only a 10 minute stroll away the local tour buses all stop outside the hotel so its easy to get to other parts of manhattan tick tock diner is convenient when youve had a busy day and want something informal portions are huge bianca trattoria is more formal but is still relaxed however it is considerably more;4
hilton universal is a good hotel in a great location if you want to visit universal studios this is the hotel to be comfortable rooms good and helpful staff bought tickets for studios from the hotel in good prices;4
we were not too happy with the original room we booked for 8 days but after our second night the manager on duty was very kind to upgrade us to a much nicer quieter bigger room free of charge the hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating to us so we were very appreciative with that this made our stay there pleasant and comfortable itâs in a wonderful location;4
the gentleman at the front desk was very friendly parking is gated which was a plus and costs 26 a day the room was outdated with visible issues see pics but nothing that interfered with the stay and the mattress was very hard the location is about 12 minutes from hollywood highland;4
all in all we were really happy with this hotel we walked up and received a pretty good rate we booked an executive level room note there is nothing special about these rooms apart from a high level there is no club lounge you get breakfast vouchers but they put you in a room next to the restaurant you can pay extra to upgrade to the main restaurant i found this whole thing weird the room was great great size and we had an excellent view down to universal studios with la to the right tv was old but watched very little beds and pillows were super comfortable pool area was pretty good and almost empty 5 min walk across to universal with plenty of choice of dining;4
great location great atmosphere room as small as i expected it to be mini bar prices and all extras in general are totally crazy but if you have been in this kind of hotel before in nyc this is hardly a surprise everything is readily available just outside starbucks deli pharmacy if you chose to pay a premium because you dont feel like using the elevator then you shouldnt complain pasquale at reception is a gem friendly and efficient;4
the hotel was really nice and the staff were excellent and helpful the room i had looked a bit small as well as a small bathroom counter i booked this through universal studios and got a great deal but i think there are probably much better and larger rooms so i think i got what i paid for i did have concern about the area it was a bit sketchy there was a homeless encampment right around the corner and i would probably not leave the premises at night with my daughters unless i had a car i never felt unsafe at the hotel though my guess is that when it was established in 1908 the area was not that bad it just got that way over time the complimentary breakfast was excellent there was so much to choose from that no matter who you traveled with there was;4
we didnt spend a lot of time in the hotel since thats not really the point but the room was a good size and there are two attached restaurants which were perfect for nights when touring made us too tired to leave the hotel the location is great one block from penn station and about 10 mins to the base of the empire state building i would stay again;4
after months of reading reviews and looking at maps a friend and i finally decided to book here we stayed a week so we were crossing our fingers that it was decent enough to see us through we were definitely satisfied with our choice many of the reviews on here are unrealistic to people wanting 5 star accommodation book a 5 star hotel we had a fantastic room singled off from the others with a generous sized living room tv area separate bathroom and plenty of space we had 6 bags and they were able to be stored without interfering with our living space the included breakfast made a huge difference in our budget its the same every morning but its great value the beds were large and comfortable and the room was extremely clean and made over every day before we;4
we stayed 5 nights from december 26 thru 31st arguably the busiest week for tourists in nyc the entire year how decadent to be able to retreat back to the comfort of our chic hotel steps from lincoln center with the metropolitan opera the ballet the ny philharmonic and broadway production of the king and i all in one place we booked 2 deluxe junior suites for our family of 5 very reasonably priced and enormous by new york standards the linens were luxurious the bathrooms modern we brought french pastries from epicerie boulud or bagels and cream cheese from alans back to the room each morning for breakfast and for dinner the nearby restaurants of rosa mexicana the smith and cafe fiorello were excellent previous reviews complain about lack of free wifi in the;4
the empire remains the hotel for opera ballet or theater visitors it is showing its age but management is making good moves in renovation the biggest problem remains heatingair conditioning too warm or too cold;4
the price location eclectic dã©cor and rooftop bar make this a hotel a true hidden gem yes the bunk bed rooms are as tiny as the pictures depict i knew what i was getting myself into but i was still a little shocked but if you pack light and are only there for a few days of getting out and about youll find it really doesnt matter i had stayed at ultra hip the standard high line which is just a few blocks away a month earlier and was thoroughly impressed but i just couldnt justify spending that kind of money again cheapest room was close to 500 glad i didnt the jane was everything i needed and the little details like free wifi and bottled water add to the value im really surprised other reviewers didnt say much about the rooftop and downstairs bars they;4
stayed here for the first time it is a great location if you go in by train about a half block from penn station it is about a 20 minute walk to rockefeller center the hotel is very nice beautifully decorated the staff was all very friendly and welcoming this is new york and it is the holiday time but i have never stayed in such a small room just enough room to fit a bed desk and desk chair the bathroom was the smallest i have ever seen in a hotel you cant open the door if the shower door is open at all one negative a towel from the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the door with hair on it i called housekeeping for more towels but none arrived i had to call again in the morning to the front desk we ate in the butcher banker;4
me and my partner stayed here in june 2014 on a road trip for 5 nights from las vegas as a first time visitor to la from england we were very confused on where to stay especially as los angeles attractions are not in one place after much searching and a lot of umming and arring due to mixed reviews and location we finally settled on the hollywood hotel good things rooms very spacious and spotlessly clean location is very good and close to universal studios and a short walk to the subway for walk of fame etc free breakfast which is ok modern rooms we stayed in the junior suite overlooking the court yard bad things some say the area is a bit sketchy but i felt perfectly safe and secure parking was charged at 20 a night which i thought was a rip off;4
we were welcomed at ameritania especially by majid who was helpful and kind and assisted with the accommodation and transport very central location good clean rooms with excellent showers very good value;4
i stayed at hotel riverside studios for two nights 91006 91106 i was traveling on business by myself and needed a cheap place not too far from the lincoln center i was skeptical of any place with shared bathrooms and these prices around 70 per night but i saw decent recommendations at tripadvisorcom including one from a single woman who said she felt very safe here the place is no frills whatsoever but if you are just looking for a place to sleep its great the hallways are reminiscent of an old fraternity house drab sterile stark my room was narrow and tidy double bed clothes rack fridge tv desk the pillows are flat as pancakes and i brought my own expecting this i slept just fine the one thing the room was missing was a mirror difficult for;4
rooms were smaller than expected not anything like was pictured on the website hotel was clean staff was great location is awesome food was good i would stay here again just dont expect to stay in a room like is pictured on the website;4
a typically good hilton hotel the rooms were a bit older but its not too bad and its clean decent size room the universal bus runs every 15 mins so that was very convient we did breakfast buffet and that was great lots of variety to eat wish we were able to try their weekend seafood dinner buffet but it 50 per person so we had to pass;4
we spent a night at the 1070room wyndham new yorker this week and got everything we expected and more the hotel is an easy 10 to 15minute along eighth avenue tofrom times square but maybe more importantly it is a block from penn station from which its an easy walk even with a rolling suitcase this makes the wyndahm new yorker a very good choice for any visitor arriving on amtrak its not the only fullservice hotel in the neighborhood of course but in our opinion it is the best choice we liked the wellpreserved artdeco ambiance in the lobby but the smallish guest rooms were newly decorated in a contemporary motif and ours had a large walkin shower in a small but adequate bathroom we thought that the public areas and guest rooms were accurately;4
this hotel is in a great location for sightseeing we arrived via penn station which is a stones throw of the hotel we found it a central point for walking and picking up the tourist hop onoff bus lots of places to eat nearby tick tock was great for breakfast hotel was clean and welcoming as were the staff the room was nice well equipped but let down by the size and view from the window a brick wall however how much time do you spend in your room when youre in new york wifi was good and all telephone calls were free including international we had our luggage stored for the day prior to our late evening flight home at a small reasonable charge overall we a had a comfortable stay here would definitely return and recommend;4
we spent 11 nights at new yorker hotel we lived in renovated room in 31st floor room was clean with very confortable mattress with good ac clean bathroom including new sink wc and shower every day room was cleaned and towels was changed as often as we wanted room has all needed perks as coffee machine got additional coffee tablets every day safe tv with more than needed channels mini fridge bathroom amenities as shampoo shoer gel conditioner soap hair dryer bath robe yes the room was tiny but we fit as our goal was to spent time in new york city not in the hotel room it was more than enough the location is perfect basically everywhere can go by foot sadly hotel do not have breakfast and not providing any discounts for guests for tick tock diner;4
stayed for 1 night in april in a suite gorgeous hotel the room was stunning and super quiet it was really modern fresh and everything was really stunning the bathroom was lovely and the shampoos etc were great quality too the breakfast was lovely too staff were really friendly at check in the only disappointing thing was that they didnât mention we had breakfast included in our booking it was lucky that i went back down to ask and i was then informed that yes i did have breakfast included and given the vouchers these really should have been given to me at check in especially at the cost of the suite its almost like they were trying to get away with not giving us the breakfast we already paid for other than that it was really lovely would definitely return;4
we were 4 people and easily fit into the room room was nice my mattress was sloping slightly facilities very clean by nyc standards no complaint there was some traffic noise but not a problem it was faint the staff were very helpful in attempting to find a lost item the location was excellent just a few steps from lincoln ctr and central park times square rockefeller center very close did not eat or drink there so cannot comment;4
