Our family of four had a fantastic time.  This is a great place for families. There were things to do for kids of all ages, including teens. Our kids (6&8) loved Star Camp! Rosa, Ismael, and Montse are the best!;5
Very nice resort. Traveled with a group of friends and we had a great time. However, the check in process is a bit tenuous and disorganized. We set up our reservations months in advance and asked for specific buildings so we could all be together. They said no problem, that is until we tried to check in. We were told that this is under local control and based on availability once we are on property. Then again another group directly in front of us in line got the rooms we specifically requested as they didn't like their locations, so it was available when we got there. Also I wouldn't recommend the Mexican specialty restaurant. Food was sub par compared to the regular dining facility. The food in the main area was fabulous!!! Beds were comfy and the A/C worked great. Dressel;5
We are on day four of our holiday and can’t say enough good things about this place!   The resort chain has made a commitment to reducing their environmental footprint, which means the grounds are returning to a more “jungly” state and the plastic waste is minimized. Those are huge pluses in my view. Add adorable little cottages for rooms, great pools, good food, and a busy, yet not over-bearing, entertainment team…and I’m thinking we’ll be back!!;5
Loved it. Especially Daniella and Julian  The food and the shows was amazing I reallly enjoyed my vacaction with all my family  Thanks for all the good attention of the staff and the beautiful amenities.;5
Was a nice spot. Seemed like a lot of people come to scuba dive which we did not. The snack bar was a nice spot for a quick lunch. Room was not super big but also comfortable for sleeping. Some said there room was hot but our room was also super cold.;5
We went as a family of 10 (all couples). It’s beautiful, amazing food, activities to do all day. The only thing I regret is not finding Daniela and Gabriela on our last day to say goodbye! They made this vacation even more fun and felt like family to us! They remembered our names all week and we learned about each others families. They were so much fun and on top of the location, i will miss them dearly. Fabian was also great-fun and taught us about the animals! Can’t forget Jose in the shop at the front! He took so much time explaining the different chocolates and what different candies were put out during Dia de Muertos. He was so patient and oh so kind. We will definitely be back (and hope Daniela, Gabriela, Jose, and Fabian will still be working there)!;5
Until last year, the Iberostar Cozumel always reserved the restaurant just off the beach as its evening steakhouse. They changed their menu about seven months ago and it is now a family style restaurant featuring pulled pork, beef brisket, pork sausage, and lemon chicken thighs. It was a complete and total disappointment as we were looking forward to an evening with a nice steak dinner at what the Iberostar considers to be  one of its upscale restaurants.  For what it’s worth you’re better off eating at the main dining restaurant and having a wider variety of food. Do not waste your time at this restaurant.;3
We just returned from 10 wonderful days at the Iberostar resort on Cozumel Mexico. This was our fourth visit in several years. We like this resort because it is smaller than some and mostly oriented toward adults since it is a magnet for Scuba divers and snorkelers.  Everything was great again this year. The grounds are well kept. Our room was well maintained and clean. Food at the various restaurants was much better than than previous visits but it was always good. The one exception was at the Oriental restaurant where the chicken in my chicken Pad Thai was tough as shoe leather. Everything else was very good. Service by the various staff was all good and everyone says hello or Good Morning and such when they pass by. Restaurant service was very good.;5
"If you are looking for a quiet place to chillax and unwind this is your place. Food is good, staff is AMAZING, environment is set literally within the jungle with bungalow rooms (no bugs), good entertainment, pools are large even when the ""cruisers"" come in, the beach is gorgeous. They have filtered water stations all over the resort. They filter the water and ice. You still dont drink from the tap. The resort is a natural bird sanctuary. Lots of excursions, recommend snorkeling as it's along the 2nd largest coral reef in the world.  We did the Bar Hop, deep sea fishing and dune buggy excursions. All were well worth the money. The shoreline at the resort is all rock so you need water socks to get in. Beautiful sunsets. There is Alberto's, just a short walk down the beach which";4
Such a wonderful time! What a great experience thanks to Julian and Gabriela!! They are the best!! Beautiful property with fun living quarters! Food everywhere, you are always taken care of!!  Numerous species of wild live on the property and a variety of activities for the whole family!;5
We had a wonderful stay at this resort. We have been many times and love the casual feel of the resort and all the nature.  We are divers also and have Dive with Martin pick us up at the dock.  I want to especially thank two people this trip who made this visit extra special.  Isabel at the front desk was awesome.  We had a minor problem at check in….but I was very crabby about it.  She handled it beautifully.  She was calm and a great communicator.  Thank you Isabel!!  Also my husband and I also had a chance to work with Manolo in the fitness center.  He was so helpful.  He is very knowledgeable and able to explain things very well.   We will be back;5
I believe this was our fourth time here. That alone says a lot. It's not a huge resort, it's quaint and quiet. They do a great job with food and the employees are outstanding. They are very quick to fulfill any needs you have. You can spend all your time there, doing things like snorkeling or kayaking or sailing, or take side trips to many other parts of the island with lots of activity options. The pool, beach and entire resort is very clean and well groomed. Staff that are excellent include Wilbur, David, Carlos Ruby and Luis for waiters and Gabrielle, Fabian and Daniella as activity leaders. Just plain paradise!;4
"We've made two trips to this resort.  (April 2022 & Feb 2023).  We've never gone to the same place twice, ever.  We'll go back here again too.  That should say a lot.  It's a sure thing for a nice vacation.  We went the first time with another couple as an escape from Covid.  We were done with all inclusive resorts, preferring to cruises or condos, but decided this was a safe choice with the uncertainty of Covid.   We had a great time.  The second trip was with our early twenties daughters as a family trip.  We picked the same resort because we knew it would ""fit"" for everyone.  I scuba dive, so that's always a challenge to find a place with diving and still have lots to do for the non-divers.  This place more than covers it.  First of all. I have to say the staff at the resort";5
We had a wonderful time at Iberostar, Cozumel. Highlights included amazingly friendly service, wonderful morning yoga with Manolo (both an energising, toning experience as well as a Spanish lesson with English translation!), super positive attentive kids club members (Rosa, Monserrat, Jordan) and a wonderful jetty full of fish for snorkelling, not to mention the fabulous sunsets! We enjoyed the food- so much choice. The Christmas Eve dinner was wonderful with lots of delicious seafood. Staff were so keen to solve any problems. The only thing I would mention is that our room was slightly run down with low quality paint work. And it seemed a lot of the apartments were similar. I think it would really benefit the hotel to do some high quality decorating out of season. I also felt;4
We tried the Catamaran and Zeus and the team was a good feel for snorklers or just stay at the boat and saw stingrays at the shallow. The Zeus team even served Beer, Margaritas and some guacamole snacks while we are enjoying the beach water! Muchos Gracias!;5
This was my first time to Cozomel and went with couples that have been going for over 25 years. This has been a relaxing and very enjoyable trip. Gabriela was very friendly and tried on many occasions to get my girlfriend and I involved in daily activities. She is a pure gem to the resort and the entertainment staff.;5
This place has taken major steps to reduce their footprint on the island of Cozumel and the ocean surrounding it.   By taking sing biodegradable products and keeping the landscape forested vs cutting it down made quite an impression.   This place is beautiful and sits comfortably in a jungle like forest.   Very tranquil.   The staff are amazing. They are always pleasant, no matter who you talk to. They go out of their way to make your trip memorable.   Evening entertainment was enjoyable.   We travelled with friends (7 of us in total)  We would definitely come back here again.   Loved it.;5
We have stayed at this Iberostar 3 times, in 2015, 2017 and this year (2023). The food has improved since 2017, the rooms have been updated, and the staff is still wonderful and friendly. There are many things I love about this resort. The cons are the limited number of beach loungers. My favorite  thing to do on vacation is to relax on a lounge chair, read and look at the water. I usually like to look for a place to lounge around 10am. It was difficult to find chairs available. It was impossible on the days when large numbers of people were at the resort on day passes. There were 4 of us and usually at least one of us couldn’t get a chair. Additional chairs would help. While we were there, the air conditioning was out for a day and a half. I am guessing that is was an isolated;4
We started this trip December 30 leaving from Toronto and going to Portland Oregon where we hung out with some friends for New Year’s and a few more days after that from there we went to San Francisco for two days and then drove down the Pacific coast highway all the way to Los Angeles Santa Monica from there we went to Japan where we spent 15 beautiful day is it amazing even though it’s cold and from there going to the Philippines. So instead of going home right away because of the 14 hour time difference between the Philippines and Toronto, we decided to kill the jet lag on the beach in Mexico we arrive to the iberostar on 16 February up until the 28th is a wonderful resort and the only reason I gave it a 4 to 5. It’s because the beach is not accessible to get in the water;4
Had a fantastic time with my group of friends at this all inclusive resort.  Although the rooms smelled a little musty when we first arrived, the resort was beautiful and had an assortment of tropical animals all around, including flamingos, parrots, iguanas and turtles.  The cleaning crew did an excellent job of maintaining the rooms and the main part of the resort was always clean and inviting.  2 Marias Tex Mex restaurant was delicious.  The pool bartenders, Adrian and Manuel made delicious drinks to enjoy in the sun.  Daniela & Fabian were fantastic event coordinators who took time to converse with the customers and make them feel welcome.  Reyes and Isidro in the lobby bar worked extra hard to make our night caps delicious.  Our check out day was my birthday and when the;4
Daniela, Manuel, Adrian, Isidro, Reyes, and Eduardo are some of the best people at this resort.  The banquet staff was outstanding, the care is top notch. I have been to dozens of countries and stayed in places from hostels to 5 star hotels, and this place has it all.  I will be back, no doubt.  Thank you so much!;5
We’ve never stayed at an all inclusive, and we were pleasantly surprised! We had 4 kids, 11 years and under with us, and Iberostar made it so easy! Food, camps, crafts, animals, snorkeling, swim, shows! Great food, and amazing staff!!! Could not have been easier, or more lovely!;5
I had a conference on the mainland but family and friends went early to dive. The diving was amazing.   We went to the fitness area everyday and met Manola Carmona. He was extremely knowledgeable about fitness but also the right way to train since he is also a licensed physical therapist. He took the time to map out the best exercises  for us, took us through the routine and sent us an email so we could continue at home. I expected to just have a nice workout with friends and left with a great plan that will help me in the future. I highly recommend stopping by the fitness center or one of his classes!!;5
What an amazing place! Over 20 of us were here for a week and couldn't ask for a better time. The hospitality and service was great. We enjoyed sitting at the beach, meeting new people and in the evening enjoying the shows provided by the resort. They have many fun activities that anyone can do. Gabriela and Alberto really know how to have fun with the crowd and keep us engaged. There are shows and games in the lobby almost every night. Don't be afraid to get involved. They might ask you to sing but don't be afraid, DJ Nancy has got your back. The bartenders and waitresses/waiters are better than any I have seen. Always checking in on you and your drink. Make sure to keep an eye out for Elisandra, her smile will brighten up your day. Overall the experience was amazing. We will;5
We just got back from our trip of 5 nights at Iberostar and our first time in Cozumel.  Some positives: the bungalow style resort and rooms make for a charming and quaint vibe. The entertainment at night was always fun and a wide variety from including the guests as the stars or bringing in live music/shows. The resort and rooms were clean. The amenities such as the gym were nice, we did not make it over to the spa. You could rent water sports (kayak, snorkeling) for 5 dollars for a 2 hour window.   The cons: if you are looking for a beach where you can get in and out of the water freely than this is not the resort for that, not many reviews talk about the rocky natural of the resort. You can swim in the ocean but you must walk down the dock to get there (or bring water shoes).;3
Manolo, our Pilates/yoga instructor was extremely impressive with his technique and leadership qualities.  He consistently reminded you to respect your body while safely pushing you to do more. Loved it! Highly recommended trying it no matter your fitness level.;5
"Iberostar Cozumel is one of 120+ properties in the Iberostar Hotels & Resorts chain. This was our first stay at Iberostar Cozumel; for the past five years we have stayed at Iberostar Quetzal at Playa del Carmen. We have posted reviews of Iberostar Quetzal here (https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d154883-r744922503-Iberostar_Quetzal-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html?m=19905) and here (https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d154883-r659684613-Iberostar_Quetzal-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html?m=19905).  A comparison of the two properties would be apples-to-oranges: While Quetzal has about 350 units (as does its “sister” property next door, Tucan), Cozumel has only about 60 units. Not surprisingly, then, Cozumel is smaller, quieter, more";5
We went to Iberostar for our wedding actually and worked with the onsite coordinator (Lina) and had a fantastic experience! The venue (on the beach) was amazing and the team there did a fantastic job, surpassing my expectations for the decorations, food, and flow of the wedding.   The resort itself is beautiful.  We specifically picked it due to the fact that all the rooms are in the bungalows (versus a concrete tower) and the resort has a focus on being eco-conscious and conservation. We also loved that you can book snorkeling/diving from the dive shop onsite as well as other excursions and loved the wildlife abounding (different birds, etc).  We stayed in the Presidential Suite during our stay which I highly recommend if you are doing your wedding there on the beach, as it;5
"My first time at Iberostar Cozumel was with girlfriends in March 2022. It was such a great trip that I told my husband, ""We are definitely going back there together!"" And so we did, along with my sister and brother-in-law, for a week in February 2023. It was even better the second time around!  Not only is the location beautiful, the grounds and landscaping alone make it worth the trip. Lush, green, and peaceful, with gorgeous flowers and even the occasional Coati family scampering around!  The food is great with lots of variety, the drinks are generously poured, and their specialty restaurants are very yummy.  But it's the staff that really makes it special. Everyone is so friendly, super attentive and willing to go the extra mile. The Iberostar app has a chat function where";5
"Our cruise had a stop in Cozumel and our family decided to get day passes to the Iberostar.  The grounds are beautiful.  We had breakfast, which had a lot of different options.  We wanted to use the pool and beach for the kids.  The pool is large and has a swim up bar.  They also have a nice size kiddie pool.  Our kids took advantage of ""Star Camp"", which is a kids activity area right next to the pool.  Our kids made crafts and played on the playground.  Ismael, Rosa and Montse at Star Camp gave our kids a fantastic experience.  We would definitely choose to stay at this resort next time we come to Cozumel.";5
10/10 experience at Iberostar Cozumel!! The employees are incredibly friendly as well as helpful! Ismael, Rosa, and Montse (for example) are very good with children and are always ready to help out. The food, activities, and entertainment are beyond good!!;5
The food choices are great, if you are an omnivore. If you are vegetarian, or heaven help us, vegan, your choices for your visit are going to be very limited. Questions about the ingredients of a dish are met with blank stares.   Overall, I liked my visit. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The Spa is remarkably over priced!! I think every one means well, but a few areas are missing.   Having alcohol part of the all-inclusive isn't always a good thing. I saw way too many visitors totally blotto, and acting like complete jerks.;4
After 7 stays at the Cozumel iberostar, this is the last. Started coming in 2004.  My friends that travel with my husband and me are in complete agreement that in the future we will look for an all adult resort. The rooms are clean, the food good. Atmosphere wonderful and tropical. However, we are past wanting to be around tons of screaming. Unattended children.  We understand the bottom line of any business is bring in as many as you can. We don't begrudge iberostar. We also don't begrudge families for bringing their families. However, there's precious little for teenagers to do here at the resort and I feel sorry for them here. They can sit on their phone at home. Pool chairs have pool toys on them overnight saving for the chairs day after day, never giving anyone else a;3
Ismael is a funny guy great to be around and Rosa and Montse were very helpful. The bartender Julian is very good and helpful he works at the front desk and always makes the drinks so wonderful and amazing.;5
Iberostar is the best hotel I have ever been at. The employees are very welcoming and helpful. The star camp members Ismael, Rosa, Montse are very nice and help with your little kids. Also Julian is the best bartender highly recommend him.;5
This is a great location, especially for divers.  The dive shop is located right on site.  They offer 2 morning dives and 2 afternoon dives every day which allows for lots of flexibility for scheduling.  The Iberostar is the farthest hotel south on the island and is right on top of the best dive spots.  If you do a two tank dive, they actually come in to the dock in between dives so you can go to the bathroom and get a water or soda.  Most boat rides to the top sites were 15 minutes or less.  Great boats and dive shop.  The resort is great, it's laid out in little 4 room buildings so it feels very private.  Each has a deck with a hammock.  The beach and pool were great, we were always able to find a comfortable spot (Mid December so hotel may not have been full).  The food was;5
Ismael, Rosa, and Montse are the best! They have great food and amazing views here. The bartenders (Especially Julian) are polite and make great drinks for everyone. They have everything you need here including a gym, spa, and snack bar.;5
amazing! love the star club, food, and entertainment. We love ismael, rosa. and montse . ANGELO IS THE BEST STAR MEMBER EVEN THO HES NOT HERE. Julian is the best bartender. highly Recommend. Make sure you participate in all activities!;5
My friends and I stayed here for week with their diving package and it was great. The suites were adorable and clean, good food, and friendly hospitality. The diving was also absolutely incredible. Would definitely come back;5
I was a little leery going to Mexico and had a hard time choosing a resort. We needn't have worried as this is an amazing place! All the staff are so helpful and friendly. The food was amazing, even in the buffet. We were surprised to see sushi and oysters some evenings as well as power juices at breakfast. You would be hard pressed to not find many items to your liking. The food was very tasty with lots of flavor. I think I ate my weight in fruit while there. We did not have any trouble booking our al-a-cart meals either. There is an app you can download and choose your restaurants and times at your leisure. Even if you change your mind on the time or location it is very easy to change it.  The grounds were well-kept and the rooms were cleaned daily. Bathrooms were modern with;5
We had a fantastic time at this fabulous resort. The grounds are beautiful, our room was clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything needed, and the food was exceptional. But the most impressive thing about this resort was the staff. Everyone went above and beyond to meet all our needs and wants.;5
I had a first-class instructor, Manolo.  He patiently guided me to understand various positions and offered modifications for a beginner. I felt relaxed and comfortable with trying something new. Look forward to returning and doing it again.;5
We booked our stay at Iberostar expecting a lively, engaging resort stay. The resort was clean and well kept but the crowd it attracted was not what I expected for the vibrant lively-looking hotel. We are an outgoing mid-30s couple and it was difficult to find any couples who were around our age to socialize with during our stay.   Entertainment around the pool and pool service was nearly non-existent. Pool bar staff were regularly disassembling their bar service at 5 when the bar closed at 6. . This resort really caters to the diving culture which is easily accessible through Dressel Divers (10/10!) right on the resort.   Aside from that, the stay and staff were less than entertaining. It was difficult to stay awake beyond sundown— which is okay sometimes, but not every night.;3
Our group of eight had the best time at iberostar Cozumel. The food was amazing as was the entertainment. The bartenders, Edgar, Ruby & Hojesus took the best care of us at the pool bar. We had so many great wait staff at the restaurants. The daily entertainment at the pool with Gabriela, Daniela and Julian kept us laughing and limber. So many great pool talks with them as well. Belly laughing is good for the sole!!  The snorkeling/diving is beyond awesome here. First time to Cozumel and we will definitely be back to this resort!!;5
Where do I start?   We traveled with another couple and stayed for 7 days.  Check in was the usual 15 -20 minute resort check in.  They have an app they ask you to download and check in prior to arrival which we did.   Don't waste your time, They redo everything anyway.   Then on to the rooms.  Not really any decorations in the room just a bed, two nite stands with no power nearby, a dresser with a couple of outlets and 2 non functioning USB ports nearby, a small table and one chair.  The bathroom looked like Stevie Wonder painted it but the shower worked great.    The doors to the rooms fit so poorly that our companions found a snake in their room on day 2 and then a frog on day 5.     The entire resort could use a good power washing.   On a 7 nite stay you are only allowed to;1
An Excellent teacher for Yoga and Zumba is Manolo!  Perfectly guided us step-by-step with kindness, patience and encouragement.  Manolo is a professional who gives extra care to your fitness level. ❤️;5
Wonderful resort.Relaxing well run.You will not find a resort more caring of customer service.All staff are friendly and willing to help with anything no matter how small the request.We had a few small things after torrential rain and they were resolved in minutes.This hotel is what an all inclusive resort should  be.Special thanks to Montse and front desk staff.She is bubbly and cares about the guests.i had the best hot rock massage in the spa.;5
I visited the Iberostar in Cozumel with my family (parents, brother, sister-in-law, and boyfriend), and while I would personally label it a family trip, we are all 27+ in age so I called it a couples trip for the purposes of the review. Even though we all typically have different travel/vacation styles, we had an amazing time! There was something for everyone to enjoy individually, and things we could do together. A particular highlight for all of us was the workout classes with Manolo. We all tried pilates, yoga and Zumba. Manolo was one of the best class instructors I've ever had. He is very positive and enthusiastic, and truly reinforced that every body is different. Every class was bilingual, taught in Spanish and English (which I enjoyed since I'm always trying to improve;5
My wife and I were initially drawn to the Iberostar Cozumel as a good place to vacation in the Covid era.  Every unit has a separate outside entrance (There are no elevators or hallways).  Many of the restaurants have one or more sides open to the outside, and nothing forces you into close contact with other guests.  However, we came to love it for everything else it offers.  The emphasis here is on the outdoors and the grounds.  We wanted to snorkel, and there are major reefs just off the resort including the “best in Mexico”.  Their snorkel trip was wonderful.  They do lots of scuba also, but we didn’t participate in that.    The beach is nice.  There are coral rocks just off the water line, so you might want to wear “swim shoes”, but the water is fine.  But we reclined in the;5
This was my first time staying at Iberostar Cozumel and our stay did not disappoint!   This all inclusive has a jungly feel with flamingos and a talking parrot, lots of birds, palm trees, banana leaves.  All the buildings have hut style roofs and brightly painted buildings, the rooms are spacious and very clean.  The grounds are well maintained.  We spent most of our time on the white sandy beach with beautiful blue water.  My boyfriend loves diving, he enjoyed having dressed divers on site to go out scuba diving 10 min from the resort.  He went scuba diving almost everyday.  I enjoyed several yoga/Pilates classes with Manolo, he is an excellent instructor and he took special care as I have some mobility issues.  He offered to help with some exercises to help increase my;5
Yoga with Manolo was excellent! The setting by the beach was beautiful and Manolo was calming and an excellent instructor! He helped with posture and mental peacefulness during the practice. Looking forward to attending another class with Manolo! <3;5
Second time staying here and absolutely loved it even more than the first. Manolo was our favorite, leading an amazing yoga class right on the beach, with the waves in the background. It was a picture perfect experience. Can’t wait to come back!;5
Love this place, and Manolo is super helpful and conducts an awesome yoga class near the beach.  Food is very tasty with a lot of variety.  A little rainy on day 2 but the staff holds many activities inside to keep it fun!  We plan to come back year after year.;5
Our second time at the Iburostar Cozumel. Had a phenomenal time! I would highly recommend the morning/afternoon yoga/pilates/dance classed with Manolo! My wife talked me into going to the classes with her (my first time doing yoga) and I had a wonderful time!;5
"I love this resort.  It is not the fanciest, but I love the Hut-like atmosphere and layout.  The only disappointment is the beach.  As everyone knows, that it is rocky, but I thought the water was very ""murky"".  However, when we went out on snorkel excursion, the water clears up, right away.  I don't know if it is because of the weather/wind but I don't remember it being so dirty 15 years ago.  If you are looking for laid back with good swim-up pool bar then this is your spot!";5
My fiance and I had the best time. Became friends with some other couples here and created lifetime memories. The entire staff was fantastic, always with a smile on their faces and very personable. Julian with the entertainment and activity groups was fantastic. We will be back!;5
We love this all inclusive. This is our second trip. We traveled with family and our 4 and 6 yr old grandchildren loved star camp. Best kids camp I have ever seen and the kids loved it.  Rosa , Ismael, and Montse were incredible!  The gym was also very good and we enjoyed Manola very much. He is a physiotherapist and also helped with our Spanish. He was very qualified.  The restaurants were all good with exceptional service and a callout for Cindy.  You can walk the beach for at least a mile. and we enjoyed the food station by the beach with ceviche and different fresh grill daily for lunch.  Service was great at all stations.  We enjoy the layout because it’s not a hotel setting but 8 plex huts everywhere. Rooms were accommodating but who wants to be in a room?  Best of all the;5
Julian and Gabriella were so great, they both made our experience memorable. We had fun playing the pool/beach games and enjoying the entertainment. Rogelio was also fantastic and provided us with great service!;5
"Not a dull moment.  We are not  resort people but this experience was excellent. The STAR FRIENDS gave great encouragement to try new things and relax the Mexican way. Food was Good.  Our favorite was the Japanese restaurant. Hats off for Julian , Stephanie Humbert "" supersexy and our favorite Gabriella. It was so interesting talking to her about life in Mexico . Gracias .";5
Everything here was amazing, how everyone was with all our group, the service for all the departments excellent… every day going to the buffet and have the table ready was great! The entertainment by Julian and Gabriela super fun, motivating us to participate in all the activities. The food in general delicious. I hadn’t been in a resort like this, definitely we are coming back.;5
"Buffets was by far the best food at the resort.  Fresh, very appealing and a great variety.  Specialty restaurants were less than impressive.  Their foods were average at best; even the Mexican restaurant.";5
We were looking for a resort property with a high quality dive shop and services on site. We were delighted to find a great dive & stay package with Iberostar-Cozumel and Dressel Divers. Diving was awesome, diving staff were exceptional. Staff at the hotel were very welcoming and gracious across the resort from check-in to restaurant staff, bar staff and concierge services. Accommodations were very comfortable and well maintained in a beautiful setting. Fun atmosphere and evening activities and we truly appreciated the focus on sustainability.;5
We have loved every minute, aerobics with Gabriela and Julian were so fun. Food has been delicious anywhere we ate and we would return 😋 in a heartbeat!! All my group was enjoying the trip... ❤️❤️🥳🎂;5
We’ve been traveling for the past seven years and twice a years for the past 5.  This clearly is a favorite.  Isabel at the front desk has taken very good care of us.  I would highly recommend asking for her, she does a great job helping with whatever you need as far as rooms or other issues.  We love the buffets and have made friends with several waiters and waitresses.  Cindy is our favorite we love her and her beautiful smile..  We even stay in touch throughout the year with her and her family.  For dinner we love Wilbert, he always takes good care of us too! Each visit they all make you feel like you’re home.  There have been a number of changes in staff in the last few years that we feel is sad.  A lot of other familiar faces we enjoyed seeing are no longer there, Angelo;5
First I want to thank Isabel for always making the check in process so easy.  She always goes out of her way to be as accommodating and helpful as she can, which is so appreciated after a long day of travel.   I would also like to thank Cindy who makes every breakfast and lunch great. She goes out of her way to take care of us and makes us feel like family.   Rooms are clean and fridge is stocked daily. The grounds are well kept with beautiful plants and flowers.  We don’t make reservations at the restaurants because there’s plenty of great food at the buffets.   Normally we dive with Dressels, but decided against them this time because we didn’t feel safe on our last visits.  We went with Scuba Tony and they were awesome!! Highly recommend… we felt very spoiled.  Maximum 6;5
It was a nice time but we had a few issues. We stayed 11 nights.    This was my second visit and I brought my mom for her first time here. This place is absolutely beautiful and unique and the staff is so friendly and helpful. Check in was good and the new room keys n the all-inclusive bracelet are FANTASTIC. Food was really good. We did the Asian place twice and the Mexican twice, buffet the other nights. The desserts are wonderful and there were nights we tried 5 or 6 different ones…haha    Argely was our favorite beach waitress. She was just so sweet and attentive. She made our stay so much better!!! We did a few days by the pool and enjoyed the games and entertainment staff quite a lot, which I can’t say I’ve ever said before. The beach here is wonderful and the water is;4
This was our second time there. We will not go back.  Food was a great disappointment. We expected food like soup, pizza, pastas, sauces etc,., to be hot but was served barely warm or cold. Very limited fish selections - mostly Tilapia. This applies to the three al a carte restaurants as well.   Beach was NEVER cleaned. The lounge chairs never cleaned or set up for the morning. We saw the same pieces of garbage in the sand for the whole week. There was exposed electrical wiring in the sand beside the seating areas due to broken conduits. The stairs into the ocean off the dock have broken steps - very dangerous and unsafe.  Understaffed at the bars - long lineups to get a drink, especially when the hotel welcomes day trippers from the MANY cruise ships to swarm the beaches,;2
Great fun and proper instructions for zumba yoga and pilates with Manolo. He has such energy but also knowledge to guide us.  Recommended and also the overall hotel experience as such a beautiful place.;5
Manolo offered wonderful classes. I only attended yoga and Pilates but I’m sure his other classes, such a Zumba, are just as great! Starting my day with manolo was the highlight of my trip!! Thanks so much!;5
Very good diving services and location (close to the dives sites) It s a nice little village with beautiful housing buildings Relaxing area are comfortable  Thanks to the staff to have made my stay so enjoyable;5
Nicely located if you enjoy nature and diving. The food is very good at the grill beach restaurant (lunch and snacks), ok at the main buffet but à la carte restaurants are disappointing. There is a nice variety of drinks and some bar tender are well trained. The rooms are comfortable with enough space but a bigger dresser could be useful. The pool is nice and big enough with a bar. The activities are great: volleyball, tennis, archery... But the pool table could be better located and leveled. The lobby is a nice place to hang out. There is a theater for special performance. The sound system could be better quality though (speakers) because it's sometimes too loud. The spa is very expensive. I recommend getting massage somewhere else.;4
Love the water stations. Should put one right by the pool. Friendly staff, great drinks. The food was good and dessert was the best I’ve had at an all inclusive. The kids had a BLAST at the Kids camp and wanted to go back every day. Overall great experience;5
Food quality needed improvement, bartenders needed more training - you would order the same drink from 3 or 4 different bartenders and get 3 or 4 different drinks. Quite a few guests got ill this trip.;4
Manolo does an excellent job of leading bilingual classes. I attended 4 classes throughout my stay, and every one offered something a little bit different. As an avid practitioner, I was thrilled to see yoga offered as an activity at the resort, and even more thrilled to get to experience these great classes in such a beautiful setting.;5
We traveled with 8 of us, 2 being young kids and there were plenty of fun activities for all the ages. The food was all delicious and the staff very friendly. Our kids absolutely loved the kids Star Camp and Monserrat and Rosa are their new favorite people. They did kite flying and puzzle making and treasure hunting. So many fun activities.;5
We have been coming here for years and while this isn’t a fancy high end resort, it is comfortable and feels like home here.  Unfortunately, last night we learned they have started  a very questionable method of making money involving their restaurants.  Two of the three a la carte restaurants are very small, so it can be a challenge to get a reservation.  The smallest of the three, the oriental themed one, does not take reservations.  We tried reserving a table on the app earlier in the day, but there was nothing available - at all in any restaurant.  While waiting to see if a table for 6 became available at the oriental, my husband went next door to the Mexican restaurant to see if there was an available table anyway (you never know).  It was after 7pm and he said the place;4
I simply love this location. It is intimate and low key, I enjoy the Prestige option where I have full access to a private club area with great service. The food is always great, the resort is tucked away in relatively unspoiled wilderness and having a Dressel dive shop right on the property adjacent to one of the world's best reefs is a bonus for me. The layout of the resort is also great in that most of the activities are close together and near the beech.;5
Excellent resort! Friendly, accommodating staff.  Beautiful grounds . Loved all of the wildlife. Snorkeling right off the pier was awesome!  Crystal clear water with tons of fish, Sting Ray, star fish, octopus right off the pier! Relax on the beach or party at the pool! Can’t say enough about what a great experience we had! We could have sat for hours in the lobby with Pepe the parrot!! Can’t wait to come back!!;5
My husband and I went to celebrate my 40th birthday. Everything was excellent, our room, the food, the activities at the resort, the beautiful landscaping, and all of the people who work there were so nice and hospitable. We had a great time doing Zumba with Mano.;5
2nd stay at Iberostar Cozumel. Love the accommodations, food, beach - very relaxing family environment.  Scuba and snorkel availability is a huge us for our family.  Definitely recommend this Iberostar location.;4
I chose this resort specifically because the dive shop was located here. Totally worth every penny!!!  The staff of the resort and Dressel Divers was top notch! My only negative is a personal choice. I wouldn’t have preferred bottle beer vs cans in my fridge. That’s it!  That’s my “negative”.  I am already planning my return trip and hope to make a yearly visit!!!;5
Just returned from a great 1 week stay.    We are return guests - as we really enjoy the nature, animals, laid-back feel, and the rooms situated in small huts.   The walk to dinner in the evening is beautiful.   The landscaping / flowers are wonderful.   Resort is a must for those that enjoy beautiful walks and view the winding walkways as an adventure.     If you prefer high rise with minimal walking - not for you.   If you prefer room service in your room over mingling in the lobby - not for you.  Housekeeping for the rooms is excellent - very clean.     Loved the new addition of the room key embedded in wrist band.    No more searching for room key.    We ate at the Asian, Mexican, Smokehouse (twice) and buffet.   Thought the food was excellent at each of the four.    We ate;5
Another wonderful stay for our family at Iberostar Cozumel. We keep coming back every year for the world class scuba diving and more. Nazareno, Milly, Rodrigo, Diego, Maria and everyone else at Dressel Divers are professional and so fun to dive with. The diving sites are so conveniently located within 10 minutes boat ride that I was able to do three dives per day and still have time to eat and relax. Montse, Rosa and Ismael entertained our two kids ages 5 and 8 at the kids club every day for 5-6 hours. They did such an amazing job that my children keep asking to come back to Cozumel soon. The food at the buffet is delicious, fresh with plenty of choice. We tried Mexican and Steakhouse  restaurants for variety and were satisfied. The buffet for the New Year Eve was top notch with;5
Iberostar was very nice and the food and beach was great. Gabriela and Danielle were very kind to us and invited us to many activities by the pool. Overall I would recommend it to somebody else and definitely want to come back;5
We have stayed here 3 times now. Love the Smaller buildings/huts instead of a large multistory building for the rooms. The staff are all nice and accomaditing. We had great experience with Gabriella and Julien of the Star team during some of the activities. We used the onsite dive shop, Dressel, and have had great experiences each time. The dive sites are just minutes from the pier. Would highly recommend this place.;5
This vacation has been awesome the staff is great especially the entertainment team we love Danielle and Fabian!! We highly recommend this trip to anyone thinking about it!! The drinks and vibes and food are the best here!!;5
"This is our second stay at Iberostar Cozumel in the last 8 months and there will be many more.  The staff is so friendly and accommodating at every level, reception, maintenance, activities, house keeping, servers and kitchen.  Specifically, my wife has Celiac disease (Severe Gluten Allergy) and the staff went above and beyond to accomadate her at any of the 5 restaurants on the property and also the many bars.  A big shout out to; Fidel, Yexmi, Javier and Manuel!  The restaurants have buffet style for many of their incredible meals, but with arrangements made at check in there was always an attentive Kitchen Host (Yexmi) or the Matradee Extrodanaire (Fidel) greeting us and offering so many Celiac Friendly appetizers, entrees and deserts for my wife.  She is not a big foody and";5
My wife & I have stayed at this great resort several times before but this year we brought the entire familia with us. We had a great 10 day stay! The staff, waiters, performers and activities people here are always first rate and the facility and accommodations are first rate as well. The nice folks at the front desk are always very informative and helpful - this year Isabelle went above and beyond to help us out. Fabio was perhaps the most helpful and fun activities person we dealt with this year but they are all great! I would highly recommend this resort for any sort of getaway. We will be back as soon as we can.;5
Vacation was amazing. Just wish they didn’t sell day passes to the cruise ships.  They took all our seats by the pool and beach. The restaurants, food, drinks and everything else was absolutely amazing.;5
This place was great for a relaxing resort. I loved everything about it, including the fun cabanas/rooms with comfy beds. The pool was large and most of the time you could find chairs. It is not a party resort, not as much with regards to entertainment.  They had some pool activities but they didn't hype them up and there was no music at the pool that had a swim up bar.  A little weird. There were shows at night that were pretty good and a nice area to view them.  By far, in all the 12+ resorts we've stayed in Mexico, it had the best food.  Marvelous food!!!  Good seafood, best desserts, just super yummy.  I liked the idea of the water areas that also included ice.  And of course flamingos and talking parrots make a fun experience.  Lovely beach with shade and lots of wait staff;5
I reviewed this hotel 8 years ago when we first took our 3 year old here.  She is now 11 and we returned to the hotel with friends in tow based on our previous experience.  The Iberostar did not disappoint!!  If anything this hotel has gotten better!!  The staff is friendly, hotel is amazing.  We love the grounds and all the effort the hotel goes into making the hotel picturesque.  The animals at the hotel are great for kids and we will neve forget Pepe (the green parrot we fell in love with),and Sylvester and Halloween the cats.    One very important area of improvement was the effort made to be eco friendly.  We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED their recyclable glass bottles and refill stations to use for drinking water versus plastic bottles.  AWESOME!!    I have to say the greatest;5
Amazing service and staff! The food was incredible and we loved every minute of being here at the resort. Daniele was awesome! We hope to come back here some time in the future! Couldn’t recommend it enough!;5
"Let me start by saying, we really enjoyed our stay at this resort.  There was only one major complaint and that was the beds. They were absolutely terrible. To be fair, they did replace the mattresses (with other previously used mattresses) to try to fix the problem, but the replacements  were only slightly better. We just toughed it out and took Advil for our backaches each morning. Honestly, everything else facilities, grounds, pool, beach, etc. ranks at 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion. However, the staff gets a 5 out of 5 stars. Very friendly and seemed to genuinely care about your satisfaction. Honestly, they are much better than the staff at most places I have stayed.  The best way I can describe the stay at this resort is it is like going to ""Summer Camp"".  If you go in";4
We spent a week at the Iberostar Cozumel on a stay and dive package. We were able to enjoy 8 dives on-site over 7 days, and on one day we did an excursion to the mainland to dive the Cenotes. The resort rooms are simple but nice, most important was that the bedding was comfortable and the space was clean. The food at the buffet did not disappoint -- there was always a wide range of foods available, though the variety didn't change that much over the course of the week. The 'a la carte' restaurants were just okay - the Mexican (probably not surprisingly) was definitely the best. I can't really speak for the other activities as we largely just did the diving, though we did take out the catamarans, which was fun, and we tried out the archery range and a few of the evening;4
It is an amazing place for divers and super convenient if you want to dive every day. Super nice staff. Environmentally friendly, no plastic facility. On the doom side, the room smells musty. Food is very good.;4
Very good location to relax and enjoy the beach , snorkeling , diving. It is not so crowded resort and easy to access buffet and bar. Restaurants are limited seating so it will be available basis. Diving club is on the property easy to book and access. The dock is on the property to go diving;4
Good stay overall but when it rains need to have other options for guest like hot tubs or other indoor activities. Much of the indoor building has thatched roofs that were not updated properly causing major flooding in the main lobby and theatre. I witnessed 5 people fall hard on the floor including elderly. This is dangerous. Staff needs to be trained to help mitigate dangerous areas and also roofs and buildings need to be updated.;3
Accommodations were lovely, entertainment as well, I do wish the bars stayed open later every night and the beach had a lot more chairs for the people at the hotel but I believe there was a cruise ship that docked and people were hanging out on the beach. Other than that we had a great time;4
Overall, I sincerely enjoyed my stay at Iberostar, we felt 100% safe, enjoyed the clean room, and I want to compliment the lady who was in charge of cleaning our room, during our stay there, her name I believe, was Lucero, that lady, works hard, very pleasant, professional, and a solid positive representation of the overall pleasant culture, there. because of this experience, my family has designated, Iberostar, as our new my go to spot, in Cozumel. 100%, Thank You.;5
This is a terrific resort where travellers can just “hang out”.   There were a lot of family groups that booked a stay. The buffet meals were good, grounds cleaned, air con good.  Internet was generally fast.  Their mixed drinks were good and they were quick to adjust them when asked (more Tequila, for instance). I’m I found the beds and pillows to be  V Good.   The pool is fine (fun for kids, too).    I did about 10 dives. The dive masters and crew were excellent and extremely attentive to ones needs.  I had my own dive gear,  but the gear from Dressel Divers is good.  The dive sites are good - not the “best ever “ as some over eager folks profess.  But the swim throughs are worth repeating.  Water temp was 83° F.   In all, we plan to return.;5
"I have traveled extensively and I must say this is the best resort I have stayed in.  The staff was amazing; very accommodating and attentive, the food was absolutely outstanding,  amazing variety and selection. I have a food allergy and the staff was very diligent about making sure of what I could eat and what I needed to avoid. The accommodations were perfect. The grounds and the beach as well as the rooms were  Clean comfortable and beautiful. I would love to make this a yearly. The entertainment was amazing as well. You really don't need to leave the resort everything is right there. I'm ready to go back!";5
Amazing Getaway!!!! After a 5 day stay at Iberostar Cozumel. We loved everything about it: the service, the food, the amenities, the location. I could not have been more pleased. The service was spot on, my special thanks to Anargely for her super excelence service, Angel at the lunch restaurant wonderful service, the grounds were just as delightful... I could not have felt more comfortable, installation, rooms super cleans. The Entertainment Team made happiness to our nights, Thanks Daniela Bonita. The food was phenomenal, the drinks were as flowing as I wanted them to be, the staff was more than accommodating... I can't even list any imperfections because if I had any, they were so minuscule and rectified by the staff immediately. What a wondrous and marvelous few days of my;5
Check in was great, we got this wrist band for your room so its always with you. Room was always cool and had a great shower. Plenty of towels, and a very close place to get filtered water for your room.  Everything was walking distance pool, food, entertainment, and of course the beach. They kept everyone well fed as the place offered a great variety of food to choose from. I cant wait to go back again since everyone was so nice there.;5
This is our third Christmas at Iberostar Cozumel and they have really made great improvements this year! The entertainment staff is AMAZING!! Gabriela, Julian, Fabian are the absolute best! The bar and wait staff are the very best. Even with crappy weather this year they have made our stay perfect!!!;5
Julian and the entertainment team were great!!! I got some great dance lessons from Julian and had lots of fun. I met many great people and would highly recommend going to Iberostar. It is a fabulous place for all!;5
The Iberostar Cozumel is a terrific resort for families, couples, and solo travelers to escape to. The resort layout is pretty cool. It’s clean,  quality service oriented, and concerned about you enjoying yourself.    Probably the best part is that all staff seem to be genuinely kind.  The pool is a delight for kids, the diving good, food very fresh, beds good….. like I said, a place to really “vacation”. After many years living in SE Asia, being in Cozumel is a wonderful addition to “places we love to hang out and get some diving in”.;5
This is my 2nd time to Iberostar Cozumel and it didn't disappoint! The rooms were clean (except for small ants that would come out if anything sweet was left out), the beds super comfortable, the landscape was extremely beautiful, and the entertainment throughout the day and evenings were so much fun and awesome! The wait staff was always smiling and ready to get whatever you needed, sometimes even bringing drinks when you were running low, without being asked. The activities are super fun and you have a wide range to do. This year, I scaled back from doing everything as I wanted to just relax at some times and get a good tan in the pool. You have that choice! The shows at night are superb with the best singers I have every heard. Thanks for entertaining me with your awesome;5
Excellent instruction, wonderful vibe. Manuel offers yoga and Pilates with a beach view daily at 8:30. There’s also beach yoga in the late afternoon. The morning classes are a perfect way to start your day! The food and entertainment were also highlights, truly something for everyone;5
Great beach volleyball and food! Good place to escape the cold in winter. Got to meet a lot of nice people! Love the workers, Daniela and Fabian! The sushi at the Oriental restaurant was amazing! They have great desserts.;5
Everything was amazing! Adai, Israel, and Venus at the star prestige club were amazing! Our servers Cristobol and Roger were fantastic. Amazing service and friendly faces. We really enjoyed our time at the Iberostar. 10/10 recommend!;5
Rosa, Monse, Julian and Ismael from kids club ate awesome and they have kept my daughter entertained throughout tour trip. Highly recommended  Highly recommend Ibestor as its a great vacation paradise for families;5
Loved everything about this property. Nestled in a tropical setting south end of the island away from the crowds and cruise ships. Very environmentally conscious. Beautiful snorkeling right off the beach. Rooms are tastefully decorated adequate space for all your things . All the Staff is very friendly , service is great. Loved the Mexican restaurant.;5
We have been coming here for many years. It has changed so much and not for the better. They are very short staffed now. Food choices are not so good. Cindy and Wilber are our favorite servers. The star friends don’t let you know when the games are. And Gabriella was the worst. She would not let anyone play the beach volleyball because they were full with staff and the ship cruise staff. She was very rude about not letting paying guests play. The shows are not as good. We love the rooms and the hammocks on the porch.;3
Morning yoga with Manolo was the best way to start the day. i’ve never felt as relaxed as I did at the end. He does such a great job explaining the poses and leading the breathing rhythm. Definitely going to try his other classes while we’re here!;5
Iberostar, Cozumel is awesome. The grounds are filled with peacocks and flamingos! The beauty of the Mayan Rivera is on full display. Zuri, at the concierge desk can help you with almost anything! Enjoy!;5
Overall this resort was beautiful and charming. The basic bungalows were clean, cool and had a nice deck on each with chairs and a hammock. Our room had some items not working (lighted mirror, clock, usb outlets) and they tried, but could only fix the clock. Not a big deal in our mind, but it would be nice if everything was working.  The temperature is set at around 22 Celsius degrees and to change it you must contact the front desk but it felt great and we never had to do that. The air does run the entire time when we’re not in the room, which seems very inefficient in my mind.  The rooms lack a coffee maker. I had to walk quite a ways to get my morning cup, but at least I got my steps in doing that! They do not have bottled water and use glass containers. You can refill those;4
Me and my husband came here on our honeymoon and we had the most amazing time. Everything was so wonderful and everybody was so incredibly kind. Bianca at reception is so nice and helpful. Leonel is the best bartender here! We went snorkeling with Paola and she was great! Yexmi the kitchen manager was so nice she sent us chocolate strawberries because it was our honeymoon. The food was pretty good but I wish there was more Mexican food. On Wednesday nights the buffet is more international and the only Mexican food they have is chips and salsa  It’s more of an older crowd here it’s not technically a super “romantic” destination since it’s a lot of families as well but that was fine with us because we’re not huge partiers we preferred it this way. we were here to go on adventures;5
Manolo’s classes were the highlight of our trip! I took Zumba, sunset yoga, and pilates classes with him during our family trip and really enjoyed them. I was even able to rope my sisters and father into a few classes because I raved about them so much. This is perhaps the first trip where I am leaving in better shape then when I arrived :);5
Overall it was okay but somethings could be improved like more staff (bars and servers) and quicker service in refilling food trays in the buffet. Food was good and our AC was freezing, nice. Rooms were clean. Never heard of any complaints about the rooms like what some people say. Mattress could be softer for sure. They really bothered my back.;4
This was our first trip to Cozumel but will definitely not be the last.  We had a wonderful time.  The people and accommodations at Iberostar were great.  I highly recommend going if you have never been.;5
Stayed here many times. Seems a bit under staffed in the restaurants compared to years past but still ok. Dive shop is always great and extremely convenient. Make sure to say ‘hi’ to Leo at the pool bar.;4
Diving at Iberostar with Flo Efinger has been one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had with diving. Being a divemaster myself it I am always a bit critical of other divemasters. But Flo was amazing! Flo above all else makes sure everyone is comfortable, safe and has an amazing dive. It was my fathers first time in the ocean and watching Flo work with him to get him comfortable was something else and it made the experience for both of us much more enjoyable knowing I didn't have to worry about my father. The Divemaster can make or break a dive trip and Flo definitely made this trip incredible! Anyone coming here should seriously consider diving with Flo if they can. I am so excited to be coming back here with many more people of july of 2023. This is an excelent resort;5
I am here now and they have Christmas lights up on the walking bridge and the lobby. However, they aren't on or working. The bridge is so dark it is hard to navigate. Get some lights working please. Love it other than that.;4
We travelled as a family booking 3 separate rooms.  In our opinion, the food and service were excellent. Entertainment was also very good with a special shout-out to Daniella, who was amazing. Our villa was on the second floor, which I do not recommend if you are not accustomed to stairs—they got wet and slippery most mornings or whenever it rained. I also found  the ocean access rocky and dangerous to enter— I could not walk in holding my infant grandson because of fear of falling. There are steps off the adjacent dock but they are also slippery and rickety. We had massages on site which were amazing $150USD each plus tip. Sunset yoga and morning Pilates are offered but the older Mexican gentleman conducting these classes seemed quite pompous and was not the best instructor (my;4
I went with a group for a dive vacation.  This was perfect for this.  Great integration with Dressel Divers, and the hotel was very accommodating to our group.  The grounds are simply beautiful. The landscaping was amazing - beautiful and well maintained.  I loved that they seemed to be very eco-conscious.  There were no plastic water bottles - instead they provided water bottles in the room and several water fill stations throughout the property.    The food was plentiful.  I wish that the food and drinks were a bit bitter.  It was all plentiful and varied, but didn't match the quality of the grounds and the service.;4
Our family had an amazing time. The staff is outstanding, especially Daniella and the swim up bar staff Manuel and Adrian. They all went out of there way to make it a great experience all week. Thank you for your hard work and dedication;5
Stayed here in December for a friends wedding and we had so much fun! They worked so hard to make sure we had a great time! Ismael and Daniela were awesome. Great drinks and lots of food options! We also loved that they have direct beach access and lots of beach space and it’s right by a dock for any tours you may want to take. Would stay here again!;5
"Just stayed for a week with my family and it was fantastic!!! Check in was easy, service was always fantastic, food was great; buffet was lovely with lots of options, a la carte restaurants were decent. The resort grounds were absolutely beautiful, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the pool/beach area was beautiful. Staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodateing, but Daniella and Adrian were 2 of the best! Daniella was so awesome, always checking in with us to ensure we were having fun and playing the games at the pool, she was a part of the family for the week and we will miss her dearly ❤️ Overall, great stay and I would recommend this resort to anyone!!!";5
Resort is small. Easy to get around.  Beautiful grounds, very forestry.  Many ferrel animals on grounds.  Food was superb.  Rooms efficient, could use updating.  Employees friendly and helpful.  Beach is gorgeous but rocky in water.  We would definitely go back.;5
We had a great time with family enjoying the resort over Thanksgiving week.  The staff is friendly and takes pride in the property and it show to their guests.  The food was good and the rooms were clean.  It is a great location to relax and enjoy the beautiful island of Cozumel and dive on their wonderful reef.;5
An exceptional international experience. Friendly people from all over the globe to meet and share. Beach was peaceful, sandy and the water warm and calm.  Food was amazing as my waistline grew quite a bit. The Thanksgiving buffet was phenomenal. The Turkey moist and delicious and the mashed potatoes were soooo good! They had a hard time keeping that bowl full.  So many delicious foods to choose from every day and the dessert selection was over the top! I’m sure I ate more desserts in one day than I do in a month at home.  The grounds and rooms were clean and comfortable, all the staff was polite and helpful. And Dressel Divers on site did not disappoint. What a great place to spend Thanksgiving week!;5
Manilow’s morning yoga class was phenomenal! He was so kind and encouraging to all of the students. I had a nice workout and was left with a peaceful state of mind. I highly recommend this wonderful service. What a great way to start the day!!!;5
Thank you Iberostar, Cozumel for the most amazing vacation! We went to dive with Dressel Divers but had a wonderful stay at the hotel! Everything was perfecto from our beautiful rooms, great service, delicious food and charming grounds. A very special thank you to Fabian at LA PAGODA and the waiters. This was our favorite restaurant and Fabian really went out of his way to make my daughters birthday extremely special. They brought in a special appetizer and made sure every part of dinner was extra perfect. We also fell in love with our morning waiter Carlos who remembered us and saved our favorite table for 7 every morning. Although we came for the wildlife underwater, the nature and animals at the resort above the sea were so fun to watch. We all loved the flamingos, cats,;5
Gabriela and Montserrat are amazing with my kids best employees at Iberostar!! Five stars can’t wait to come back the food is amazing the volleyball was outstanding and the overall customer service experience was the best I’ve had in Cozumel;5
9 of us came down to watch my son complete the Ironman.  We have stayed here several times. We feel the food is the best on the island. The staff were so friendly. The rooms and the resort were super clean. The staff always accommodated the large group of us. Couldn’t have asked for a better vacation.;5
We went (self and two teens) to Iberostar over Thanksgiving week. Overall, very positive experience! The food and amenities were great! We dove with the local dive shop, Dressel Divers. Diving was spectacular!   The staff were fabulous from the bellhops to bartenders to cleaning crew. Very professional. We especially loved Alejandra - she was on the entertainment crew … we thought she WAS the entertainment crew. So engaged and fun with the guests !!   The only downside was that the hotel had guests from cruise ships on two of the days we stayed. This was really an interruption. I’m sure they bring in some good revenue from the daily visits, but this is a big drawback as a guest. Unfortunate.;5
GABRIELA AND MONTSERRAT are amazing! Very friendly! Very helpful! Lots of fun! The shows are amazing! The food is amazing! All the staff, waiters, house keeping, grounds keepers are all very friendly and helpful! We will definitely be back!;5
I like the food the place looks great and the peoples is really nice and for that reason I enjoyed to be here. Ismael, Fabian, Rosa, Gabby, and Danny all enjoy spending time with others and are great to be around.;5
My wife and I have been diving in Cozumel for 12 years or so. After year one, we were hooked (easy direct flight – leave home at 6:00 a.m., in the water at 1:00 p.m. – and an unbeatable bang for your buck once you jump off the boat).  We quickly began heading down 4, 5 and even 6 times a year, often for two weeks at a time. We always stayed at Iberostar. Thus far, have been there (Iberostar Cozumel only, so that’s not counting their other properties) somewhere between 56 and 58 times. We’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly over the years, but were always treated fairly.  As we became even better repeat customers – and brought them new clients (friends, families and *dive groups*) – we were treated a bit more “preferentially”. Ironically, this only entailed getting a room;2
Beautiful property, great diving and dive operator, service outstanding and food a solid 3 star.  5 years ago, we stayed at another inclusive near Iberostar and the food was atrocious.  The food here is decent with a great choice of fresh salads and decent fresh fish.  Good breakfasts with lots of choice of cereals, baked goods fruit, juices and two egg stations where you can get eggs to order quickly.  Lunch buffet has very good salads and usually the fish dishes are good and lots of choice.  Dinners at the buffet were fine, again with lots of choice.  Fish dishes good, as were chicken and pork dishes.  Steaks a little tough but tasty.    Every staff member on the property is friendly and accommodating.  Had a bulb out on our balcony and fixed within 10 minutes.  Pickup of;5
I was just stung in the leg by a scorpion while sleeping. It was under the covers in my bed. This is not the best way to wake up. The hotel staff was not too concerned and compared it to a bee sting. I’ve been stung by bees before. This is worse. Probably won’t be sleeping very well for the rest of the night.;1
It was our first time at the Iberostar Cozumel. Our hotel experience was great overall.   The Star Camp and its staff were fantastic!  Rosa and Monse took such care of our son that he preferred to be at the camp than having fun with us at the beach or even at the excursions. Thanks to both of them for being so friendly, fun and caring. We will miss you!;5
really good food, pool, good entertainment team and volleyball is fun. ismael, fabian, daniela are amazing. we come here every year and it’s our tenth time really good service. the flamingos are really pretty, lots of nature.;5
We had an amazing trip at Iberostar Cozumel. Our favorite part was the amazing activities with Daniella, Alejandra, and Fabian! They made out trip so memorable and fun! We loved playing beach volleyball, aqua zumba, and more! Thank you 🥰;5
Unbelievable resort and dive facilities. Flo was our dive master through our stay and was the most knowledgeable, caring, fun leader we've had at the resort. He was always spotting seemingly imperceptible wildlife and was always accommodating. Cannot recommend highly enough. Great dude! Great resort!;5
We had a relaxing stay here and the bungalows were a new experience for us.  Food was decent and the pool fine, could use more activities during the day. I didn’t like going outside to fill up a water bottle when I needed a morning drink and the room fridge didn’t work. Beach bar was neat and we enjoyed our stay overall.;3
It was fun. I met a bunch of new people who were nice and funny. The food was good and there were a bunch of new things. It was hot which was nice. I did some activities with Daniela and Fabian.   w.      w e;5
The food is good, very fresh. Pool is calm and relaxing, and staff are attentive. Lots of games and activities played with the staff, keeps everyone entertained. The pool is located by the main necessities, such as the lunch buffet and a bar for drinks. The staff Daniela and Fabian are entertaining and help with the games and activities;5
i really liked fabian and daniela and i really enjoyed playing beach soccer and water volleyball with them. the staff were really friendly and really accommodating, and the food was really good, as there was lots of variety.;5
Beautiful and quiet resort. Good food and service. If you are looking for a place to party, look somewhere else! But if you are looking for a place to relax or a base for scuba diving, then this place is for you!;5
Food in the buffet was good. Specialty restaurants fair. They have a good entertainment staff, but they need to download some classic rock and salsa music videos and offer dance lessons in the Mexican Restaurant several nights a week. Too much of the evening entertainment is just sitting around listening to average singing talent. GREAT scuba location, 5 minutes from the best reefs in the western hemisphere.;5
The bracelet making activity on the beach that Rosa, Dani, and Monse hosted was awesome! I got to keep a very colorful custom bracelet that I made as a souvenir from my trip to beautiful Cozumel! 10/10!;5
Rosa, Mon, Daniella, they were excellent with the kids activities in making bracelets extremely friendly and helpful. They were such beautiful ladies it was a pleasure meeting them, when we come back I hope to see them!;5
Only 1 kind of beer, no diet pop in rooms only on fountain in bar. It’s honest food, like the oriental the best.  Coffee sucked. Needed just regular coffee.  They gave you a towel to borrow, but you had to rent a snorkel 😳.  Wish they had a TV in lobby that we all could have watched .  But over all not bad for what we paid.;4
Very nice beach, pools and setting. Good food, activities, entertainment and snorkeling. Danny = amazing entertainer. Roger = awesome waiter. Arturo = fun bartender. Great time, vegetarian/vegan options too. Drinks need more alcohol. Friendly staff.  Very clean, nice property.;5
The Iberostar is absolutely amazing ! The staff are soo wonderful and friendly and helpful We loved them all! Alejandro she was entertainment and she was the sweet girl in the world ! Such a clean place;5
Disappointed that the steak restaurant had changed. Felt that the amount of food served for six of us was not up to other tables around us with two or four people. Mentioned to reception and told that a manager would contact me. No contact, disappointed;4
Restaurants were not air conditioned.  Food was not very good. Entertainment was a joke. Rooms were marginal.  The bar only carried one beer choice.  Drinks were not very strong. The staff was very kind.;2
We loved everything about this property! The food, location, facilities, everything! The jungle setting of the rooms was phenomenal and so much wildlife roaming the grounds. Sustainability is so important to us and one of the reasons we selected this property. Not one piece of single use plastic in sight! (Altho make sure to bring your own cup and water bottle…) The entertainment was fantastic! We aren’t big foodies but liked all of the food and restaurants we tried. Cozumel is such a beautiful, laid back destination. We can’t wait to bring our entire family back! And we will stay here again when we do!;5
Not being able to flush toilet paper is a negative. Having to leave your room to get your own water from a central water location isnt great either. Having beaches that are full of rocks detracts from the beach since you cant really go in the ocean. The staff is friendly,  the food is decent. But I wouldn't say anything special, as far as the food. We tried the Mexican and steakhouse restraunt and the buffet. We are more of night life people so when on two or three occasions on a four night stay the bar ran out of the type of alcohol we drink that kinda sucked. The grounds were somewhat hard to navigate as every path wound around and looked the same. Either more signage or some kind of color system for the paths would help;3
Prestige lounge Ani Lopez is the best. Very friendly, out going and makes you feel special. Never have an empty glass she is really on top of everything. We need more people like Ani. Wish there was more music at the pool. Food is good my favorite was the Asian restaurant.;4
Was lucky enough to meet Ana Lopez in the Star Prestige lounge who made our trip extra special. She went over and beyond to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. We’ve been to this resort twice and it keeps getting better!! Thank you Ana for your hospitality !! Hope to go back soon;5
Resort was awesome. The privilege area is very relaxing. The animals in resort are great to be around. Ani Lopez in the bar at the privilege bar is very sweet and helpful. She makes the experience great. Highly recommend a trip to Iberostar Cozumel.;5
Stayed at Iberostar Cozumel for scuba diving. The dive center is right there and runs like a well oiled machine. All the dive masters and staff were super professional. Spent some time at the gym with Manolo, the fitness instructor. He helped me with my workouts. We also did Aquafun and beach volleyball with Alejandra and Daniela from entertainment team. They were all amazing.;5
The resort looks like a tropical village. Very eco-friendly and lots of wildlife. Many Ironman participants stayed at the resort while we were there. Loved the sunrise yoga with Manolo. He is very knowledgeable and makes sure everyone has a great experience.;5
Diving was fantastic.  Really enjoyed Manolo’s sunset yoga on the beach - it was a really good intermediate level and he pushed you if he could tell you could do more.  Hard to balance on one leg in the sand, though!;5
Great resort with plenty of options for food and drinks.  The main things to do are scuba and other water sports.  There is a decent amount of wildlife to take in as well.  Great place to stay if you are going to scuba.  The beach is clean and the water is clear.  Plenty of wildlife under the dock as well.;4
We stayed at the Iberostar Cozumel during a recent dive trip. The rooms were nice. The service and staff were friendly. The resort was clean. The food was good, and there was always an enormous variety of options. Really my only complaint is that the check-in and check-out processes were painfully slow. We had checked in online, hoping to save time upon our arrival and we ended up re-scanning our passports and re-answering the same battery of questions we had just answered during the online checkin process. So, I'm guessing the online checkin is just a work in progress, and not a functioning system. Checkout was equally slow.;4
Ismael and Alejandra were the BEST!  Lots of activities for the 5 of us siblings/in-laws.  Good food, good drink, nice people, friendly staff and MORE!   Really enjoyed the introduction to scuba in the pool!  Planning to return for certification soon!  Thank you to everyone at Iberostar!;5
I purchased a day pass for $70 while my cruise ship was docked. I took a taxi to the resort which was $25. My food and drinks at the resort were included and so delicious!!  I used the pool, beach, was able to get a same day spa appt as well. The staff was very friendly and the grounds were immaculate!!!;5
Beautiful property, just bad bugs. The place needs to be treated for mosquitos because they will eat you alive. Buy bug spray because bug spray there is $30. Nice resort but just the bugs and wildlife.;4
My favorite daily experience were the poolside activities and especially enjoyed Daniela and Fabian. They are energetic, friendly, full of energy, great suggestions for  other entertainment here welcoming, accommodating, helpful and always with a smile.;5
Excellent resort. Food and service excellent. Rooms gorgeous. Gabriela is very friendly and a very good archery teacher!! In the evening there is live entertainment which excellent. All in all, never a dull moment!!;5
THE BEST EXPERIENCE! Highly recommend. great activities with Daniela, Fabian and Alejandra. Great restaurants! Great pool and amazing ocean view! Pool activities were the best! amazing bars and drinks! The best customer service!!;5
This is one of the loveliest resorts I have ever stayed at. The separate buildings set in more of a garden like atmosphere was very pleasant to walk through. Seeing the birds in the lobby, the flamingoes, the coaties, and even the cats made for great entertainment! The food was delicious, and we loved both the Mexican restaurant and Smoke House for dinner. The pool was a great temperature for swimming, and the staff was wonderful. Our entertainment team, Alejandra, Fabian, Daniela, and Gabriela kept everyone smiling. They were great at getting people to join in on activities! Freddie made sure the pool bar was always fun, and he even created surprises for me when I couldn’t figure out what drink I wanted! Joshua did a great job in the Mexican restaurant. Rogelio the waiter never;5
Yoga & Pilates sessions directly at the beach were awesome, thanks to Manolo! Great start into the day, good trainer, perfect level also for beginners.  In general all Animateurs were really motivated and did a great job.;5
we had a great time with stay at the iberostar resort a smaller property so we didnt have to walk so much we enjoyed  all the games and activies there was good snorkeling under the pier nice sand beach the food was ok  not great the swim up bar and pool were great  and seeing the flamingos  on the way to breakfast in there pond was nice looked like they had a nice kids club to;4
I had the most lovely time in the activities, the people here has been excellent, so kind and friendly. Ismael, Rosa, Monse, Gabriela from entertainment staff. Angel from the buffet, he was awesome too.;5
Thank you for everything Entertainment Team at the Iberostar Cozumel has been fabulous! Especially Ismuel, Rosa, Dani, Mon, Gabi, Fabion ale and humberto   The food has been delicious.  Clean rooms.  The Dive Center is really cool!;5
Alejandra that is part of the activities is very fun!!! Just won another Iberostar hat 🧢 playing bingo!!! Super fun!! The resort is beautiful and I will come back every year with my husband!! Food is great and the views are amazing! The staff is beyond wonderful!! I love Iberostar Cozumel!!;5
We were moved from Allegro due to the fire and we were pleasantly surprised by our experience.  The grounds were well kept and even though there were some other reviews about mosquitos, they sprayed while we were there and issues were limited.   We are looking forward to our next trip in April.;4
"The grounds are beautifully maintained and the resort has a great layout. The rooms were clean and had a stocked minibar. Comfy beds. We and are friends both had some facilities issues with the rooms that were fixed right away. The staff was friendly and the drinks were good, especially at the lobby bar. This resort is focused on the scuba crowd. The snorkling around the dock was awesome. We really enjoyed the buffet, which was different each of the three days wew were there. This is not a ""sit your ass on the beach and get waited on"" type of place, which was fine with us. As mentioned in an earlier review, you must keep in mind the location. It is an isolated island, in mexico...that being said, the resort does very well in the service department. We did have a weird experince";5
The hotel is amazing. Animals all around. The food is not special. The quality of the drinks in the bars are just ok. Mostly the staff treats you with kindness. The beach has a lot of rocks so you will need special shoes, but it's amazing, its like a pool on the ocean.;3
My wife and I went for a SCUBA DIVE trip and were very pleased with Iberostar in Cozumel. The dive experience as well as the hotel/resortt experience were one of our favorite dive experiences! The dive shop at this resort was very well run and rooms/cottages were very charming.;5
The staff in the restaurant, bell bys, reception had an excellent attitude and treated my son with down syndrome. People with intellectual disabilities require to be treated with empathy and understand their special needs.;5
My Wife and I took 4 friends to Iberostar Cozumel for 8 days. This is the 14th time we have been. The food and service were wonderful as always. Covid apparently gave them the opportunity to add a few things to the grounds and freshen up the place. We made new Starfriends since it has been 3 years.  Alejandra, Fabian, Daniela and Gabriela all worked hard to make our experience a memorable and fun one. Dressel Divers provided a great dive experience. Thank you very much Maria, Oky and Flo. As usual we can’t wait to return.;5
Iberostar in Cozumel is a wonderful place to stay. There are many reasons we keep going back time after time. We have visited Iberostar nine times in the past 10 years.  We have made many friends over the years that we still stay in touch with at Iberostar. The employees at Iberostar our second to none. People like Alejandro that works as a concierge at the front desk. He will answer your every question and fulfill your every need while at the resort. The bartenders are excellent at every bar. The all-inclusiveness of Iberostar Cozumel is fantastic. Food is available whenever you are hungry. There are bars located all around the resort to for fill your alcohol need 24/7. *Star Friends like Gabby, keep you involved in the activities at the resort. The camaraderie experienced at;5
I had so much fun at Iberostar Cozumel. They had food for everyone, activities for young and old, salt water pool and an amazing beach and sunset view. I loved the bartender Freddy, he always knew what to make when I said “surprise me”. I also loved the entertainment team, who coordinated so many activities in the rain or shine. Alejandra and Gabriella especially made me feel super welcome and ensured we always had a good time. The shows at night were super fun and really entertaining, as well as daytime pool activities and super easy full bar access from everywhere. The waitstaff was incredible and they had so many food options. I definitely want to come back here!;5
Always have a great time when staying at Iberostar Cozumel. Rosa helped with dream catcher craft. Alejandra is amazing at coordinating activities even when it's rainy. Fabian us so nice and made sure we played all the games. Humberto was also great at getting activities together and keeping the crown engaged. And Anna was the best bartender and helped me decide on fun drinks!;5
Even in the rain the Star Friends made it an amazing vacation. Many thanks to Rosa, Alejandra, Humbert, Fabian and Daniela. Love them all! Weight staff is wonderful. Mariela is fantastic!  Ana is my favorite drink lady!;5
"The place is very, very nice; it certainly gives you your money’s worth. The property is well kept, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The food is good, the Mexican restaurant and the Steakhouse being the best ones, just remember to make a reservation at the main lobby. Drinks depend on the bartender, sometimes they were very good and sometimes just so. The pool is clean and there’s plenty of chairs to get sun sun. The entertainment team is great!!! These people work their butt off to make sure you are having a good time. Humberto, Alejandra, Daniela, Gabriela, Fabián are great and I loved talking to them. If you’re thinking about going to Cozumel, this is your place.";4
Everything was good!! Ice and water stations could be more plentiful.  Sometimes the hot food was cold. Maybe steamer trays would help . The waiters and waitress are very accommodating. Overall experience was great.;5
The hotel is beautiful with so much nature available to you to witness.  We loved the entire trip and it made time with our teenagers a memorable experience.  Thank you to Manolo for keeping us fit during our trip - beach yoga, pilates, zumba and the gym. Thank you to all the staff that fed us as the food was excellent. Thank you to Fabian, Alejandra, Gabriela for entertaining us through the day. Thank you to Isidro for making us coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening. Thank you to Orlando and other pool bartenders to make sure we stay hydrated.  We enjoyed our entire trip - food, entertainment, fitness, snorkeling and seeing baby sea turtles.  Thank you to the management for making this available to us.;5
Very nice property.  The rooms are very clean but on the small size but we don't spend much time in the room.  The best restaurant on the property is the Mexican.  Angel and his staff are very accommodating and attentive. The food at the smokehouse was good however, the service was horrible so I wouldn't suggest going there if you are hungry.;4
The most awesome staff ever. Easy to get around for those of us with physical challenges (they will pick you up and drop you off!!) Entertainment is good, pool activities are fun to watch and participate in, and the food is good.;5
The customer service was excellent and Rosa was especially nice and accommodating.  The food could use some work not a fan of buffets. I enjoyed the Japanese pig Ada restaurant the most. Relaxing quiet trip.;5
Most everything was good. We snorkeled the beach and saw starfish.  The sunsets we're beautiful. Lots of activities and they were on time. Some of the activities were new to us and fun.   Good variety of food, sometimes cold.  Best of all was their activity people. They were personable, active and fun. We enjoyed them the best. Especially ahjendria. I'll was a fine time. I also like how green the hotel is. .;5
The grounds are lovely and the staff is attentive and friendly. There are lots of fun activities. We especially like archery and riflery with Daniela, and sunset yoga with Manolo. Daniela is so much fun while leading her activities, and also great to have a lively conversation with. Manolo’s class is challenging, yet he encourages you to listen to your body, and work on breathing and body-mind connection. The shows we’ve seen so far are great, with talented, energetic and adorable singers and dancers.;5
Absolutely loved this spot. The grounds are beautiful, the food is good, and the staff is amazing. Alejandra, Fabian, and Daniella made the whole trip. Make sure to catch the shows at night. There are activities going on all day. I can’t wait to come back next year and bring my son. All of the children’s activities looked so fun.;5
Loved it all. Second time here. Gabriella was the best from entertainment staff, she was the best! Alexandia was great too! The waiter Elisandra from the beach. In general everyone has been awesome... Sad that we need to leave :(;5
alejandra, entertainment employee was excellent check with our group everyday.  She was just an all around wonderful person to be around.  Stephanie-towel check in employee, was very helpful and explained beach towel rules.  Amstar employee- El Salvador- help us book an excursion that we will never forget.  Best vacation ever! Ryan Breedlove;5
The smokehouse restaurant was a great experience at the resort! The food was amazing, the service was absolutely wonderful! Justo, Fabian, and Vitaliano were the best . They work so hard to remember everything- your drink, preferences,  your name - every time! So friendly ,  such a great experience. Top notch! Five ÷ stars for there fellows!;5
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotels grounds are beautiful, and we enjoyed all the wildlife running around the premises. The dock is super convenient, even though we didn't dive with Dressel divers, the small convenience fee to have another dive outfit pick you up from the dock is worth every penny.  We enjoyed the food, the steakhouse and the Mexican restaurant were both very good, and neither my wife or I ever left a meal at the buffet unhappy. The hosts for the lobby games were always fun, and the entertainers on the main stage were always very good. We had only been to one other resort in Cozumel before Iberostar, but would choose Iberostar over the other resort for our next visit hands down every time. Cant wait to go back;5
Really good classes, lots of fun! Rosa and Gabriella were really friendly. Classes were regular and creative and relevant to wildlife preservation which was eye opening and interesting.   We really enjoyed our stay!;5
Manolo the instructor at the gym was amazing, very helpful and knowledgeable. Very friendly staff here at the Iberostar. Loved the staff for the pool activities. Made the day go by fast and exciting. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Wonderful service! Clean facilities. Lots of activities. Plenty of space. Food was good. There were plenty of chairs by the pool. Anything we needed help with there was staff available to assist us. Would definitely recommend! Rosa, Ismael and Daniella were fantastic!!;5
We stayed oct 11-17 2022. There were some great improvements like be able to breath! We were able to walk through the lobby and there was NO SMOKING!!! Hooray!! The buffet was generally good food. My only complaint  there was you had to ask for ice cream at dinner, it used to be out. My fiend stated she couldn't find guacamole all the time. All staff is great in the buffets.  Our room 8602 didn't have ac working very well. We didn't complain because it sorta worked, in the past rooms we stayed in got very cool. We had brought back up fans with us and that kept us ok during the night. House keepers do a great job and when we asked for more Coke instead of other drinks in the fridge, they happily complied.   Pool was alright. The reason for the 4 star is because there was a huge;4
I had an amazing time at the iberostar in Cozumel, Gabriela was an amazing employee, Francisco, Raymundo and Adrian were great bartenders, the entire service was spectacular. I will recommend the resort to all my friends.;5
Good activities, more volleyball and soccer during the day. Gabriella was great. Food was really good needed a few more times to reserve the dinner. A strawberry daiquiri machine would be great near the pool;5
Incredible:  Our first time at an Iberostar and we definitely want to return to this location. The property in lovely, clean and welcoming. Our room was very comfortable, and the food is incredible. The staff is beyond friendly. Concierge Zurisaday, helped us making dinner reservations. She was extremely helpful throughout out stay. We look forward to visiting Iberostar again...;5
For the place we like the pool the beach the restaurant and mainly the entertainment staff thank you Rosa Ismael gaby dani Fabian Alejandra and Humberto are wonderful so far so good  When we checked in Eduardo was amazing. Is very relaxing;5
Manolo is such a wonderful instructor. I have been to the gym every day. I remember him from previous visits here at Iberostar teaching water aerobics and always enjoyed his classes. Now that he’s in the gym he is very attentive to the needs of all the students needing training. He provides us with assistance on the equipment. He offers us towels and cleans the equipment for us if we need it. I recommend that everyone visit the gym at Iberostar and work out with Manolo.;5
We had the best time with our friends, mother (in-laws), and children. There’s something for everyone here. The food and drinks are excellent. There’s plenty of places to relax quietly. My kids loved all the animals. We all LOVED the entertainment staff so much. They really welcomed and included us in everything and made sure we had a great time. Daniella & Fabian were fabulous!;5
I think that all the Iberostar hotels are amazing and that we are very lucky to have  all this stuff and access to food and drinks. This is so fun and has everything to do. My favorite part is doing activities with Fabian and Daniela.;5
We are having a great vacation! We enjoy all the activities are so fun! Daniela is amazing! She is so friendly and helpful. The food has been delicious and we have had so much fun on this trip so far.;5
If like me you always read the negative reviews first, I hope you get a chance to read through to the end before you make a decision on whether to stay here or not. First impressions when we arrived here, a lovely spacious lobby, and yes it smelt a little damp…… but when the humidity is as high as it is, what else would you expect and trust me, your nose adjusts pretty quickly so by the time we got to breakfast the next morning, what smell? The grounds are spectacular, the beaches beautiful, yes rocky but if you’ve done your research you’ll know to bring water shoes. So much wildlife to see, in and out of the water. Our room was spacious and kept impeccably clean, bathroom stocked with amenities. The fridge was always topped up with fresh drinks. Food was plentiful and varied;5
Pool fabulous daniela diaz fantastic rosa was soo nice  The little shop is cute, people is so nic. AC need to be moree cooler, you can be better in food and friends. Its a beautiful hotel, diving is excellent.;5
Best trip experience ever very friendly staff and best place to dive and the staff that does games and shows were super nice and deserve a raise and the dive crew Mily and Rodrigo are the best dive masters hands down;5
This is our second visit at the resort and we have to say this is a great island get a way. There is lots to do at the resort (from watching all the unique animals, splashing in the pool or at the beach, walks on the beach, snorkeling by the dock: you see lots of unique fish, shows at night, BINGO and the lottery in the lobby and Star Camp for kids during the day). The food is fantastic and the staff is very attentive. This trip we had the couples massage and it was nice, breakfasts and lunches at the buffets and pool side cabana were great quick options for a bite to eat and the supper restaurants always had a nice selection.  IF you are a diver there is an on site dive facility and they pick you up right on the pier ocean side from the resort. First trip we took a snorkel trip;4
Rooms were comfortable and food was delicious. Buffet had lots of options and the majority were delicious  Few minor issues in the room, but the staff was quick to resolve  Gym/fitness center was well equipped, and Manolo was super helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. He made our vacation fitness fun and memorable;5
We decided to do the water aerobics, beach Zumba & beach yoga. Manolo was the instructor for these classes. He was fantastic! Cued great, gave great tips. He also was the attendant at the gym when I went one morning. Super helpful!;5
The rooms were nice and clean. There could be more variety at the buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I do not recommend ever taking the taxi off the resort. Stay on the resort. The service of the waiters could have been more prompt. Isidro is a great bartender. Gabriela is great at entertaining.;3
Great experience ! Everything in one place: great food, entertainment, diving and workout. Shout out to Manolo and his amazing sunset yoga lessons, as well as Pilates and zumba class! A week in paradise without gaining (too much) weight :);5
The food is cheap and l have suspicious that they put something to make you feel full rapidly, we spent 10 days at thee resort and my stomach just hurried every day after eat, l am not a big eater even though felt bloated also, the drinks are very very cheap alcohol, doesn’t tasty right as when you order at a regular restaurant. The room are good that’s it.;2
A very well laid out Resort, neat and clean rooms, the food was very good, great beach and wonderful view of the Caribbean Sea. The staff was very good in behavior and managing activities, particularly Daniela and Fabian were excellent in conducting events by the poolside and on the beach during day and in the lobby during evening. Because of the number of activities in the resort, we did not have to go out during the five days we stayed there.;5
"God staff, good food, friendly people.  Seventh time there and told dive shop to expect me back next year, so I liked it.  Caveats:  mentioned this in last review;  they need to provide those cheap plastic toilet brushes;  they have low flow/low level commodes, which is fine.  But in Mexico?  Touchy subject, but we are in Mexico!  I feel that is too much to ask of the staff to clean up after me on the sides of the toile bowl, but I have nothing to use except TP.  Asking fair amount of me too!  And you are not supposed to flush the paper!  They get one more chance and if no brushes next time, will let staff do the “dirty work”. And tip them extra. Another issue, the pool towels.  Whatever happened to the cards?  Contactless, i suppose.  I returned my towel early  the morning of";4
For about a year we had been planning a wedding ceremony at a resort in Cozumel.  Unfortunately this resort suffered a massive fire and eventually the wedding team confirmed that they would not be able to accommodate our wedding, meaning our wedding was cancelled! We were desperate at this point with 30 guest expecting  to attend a Cozumel wedding in just a few weeks!   We started contacting other venues in Cozumel but due to the late date, we were skeptical of finding our dream wedding location.  Once we contacted Victor with Iberostar corporate wedding department and explained our unfortunate situation, he promptly contacted Cozumel and confirmed that the date was available.   Next we had to confirm that our group of wedding guest would actually have a place to stay!  The;5
This resort was quaint and beutiful. I loved how we had access to the beach and an on-site dive shop - seperate from the hotel ( Dressel Divers). Staff was friendly. I really appreciated the access to faltered water throughout the site. The drinks were okay and food okay.;4
Everything was amazing!  I had done a lot of research for a vacation with my adult daughter and really happy that I found Iberostar. The vibe was really nice, being more low key than a lot of other places in Mexico. The staff was unbelievable!! Alejandra, Daniella, Gabriela, and Fabian ran amazing events! Definitely go see the musical shows at night, they are ridiculously good! Amber and Danny’s voices were incredible and the band on rock night certainly rocked!! The spa was great, very calm and the massage was very good. The buffet was good, with a wide selection and good taste. The a la carte nights were a really treat. My daughter and I were amazed with the manager Fabian. I have over 20 years of experience in restaurants and he was beyond impressive. Honestly, the staff;5
Great place to stay, eat, and play. Gabriela, Alejandra, and waiter Elisandra were fabulous! The diving and food were fantastic. Highly recommend to anyone looking for diving and an all inclusive resort.;5
We stayed at this all inclusive in Cozumel. The rooms were super clean and the staff were kind and respectful. Daniela, Alejandra, and Fabian were part of the entertainment crew they were absolutely wonderful and made the experience so fun. I highly recommend :);5
I had an awesome experience at this resort. Was treated very well by the staff and my room was kept very clean and well stocked. The activities were fun and a great way to make some new friends. Food was great and dinner was different each night which was nice. I will definitely be back!;5
The hotel was super nice, well-maintained and clean (thanks to all the gardeners), the food was delicious and there was plenty of choice.  Staff was always helpful and friendly.  The program, both on the beach and at the pool, was great with something for everyone, here again a big thank you to Gabriela (Gabi), Stephanie, Karen and Ismael, who do a great job.  We'll meet Again.;5
I like the food the beach the weather was really good the staff mainly the entertainment as Ismael Alejandra Gaby Fabian Karen Daniela and Stephanie thank you so much for everything because was a beautiful experience;5
The Iberostar has the best location, fun activities, and the staff is fun! They even remembered my birthday and brought a bottle of champagne to my room! The concierge booked us on a jerk tour! Highly recommend! The snorkeling tour took us to 4 reefs and they were awesome!;4
A beautiful hotel to relax, unwind, feel good and with pleasant entertainment. We have particularly good memories of Alejandra, who inspired us with her cheerful nature. In general, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.;5
room and people were great, food good, steak house awesome, wild animals fun to see. Mosquitoes everywhere, fun shows but not enough night life, hot tub only in spa and you get 1 visit per week, mosquitoes will keep me from going back;4
Check-in took too long, Concierge (a service offered) was rude and abrupt.  That's the start of our stay.  The property is quite large and we had several bags,  we had to ASK for assistance with our luggage,  another thing we have never had to do at other properties.  Turns out they have golf carts to assist guest,  something we were not offered at check in.  I have stayed at several ALL-Inclusive properties in Cozumel and Cancun.  Iberostar Cozumel All Inclusive is the FIRST that only allowed ONE top ( and I use that term lightly) restaurant reservation in the resort.  It's based on how many days you stay, others guests we talked to had the same complaints,  Some stayed 7 days and got two reservations, some stayed longer and got three.  But in NO way is the ALL-inclusive.  Not;3
In no world is this a 5 star resort/hotel.   We stayed in the presidential suite which was old and had a broken lock patio door lock that was jerry  rigged and made us feel uneasy during our stay.   No room service, no bathtub, and a $25 fee for not turning in a beach towel which was taken from us by mistake.   The food was (mostly) edible but the drinks were weak, even when we ordered doubles, and the bar was quick to run out of bananas (literally every day we were there) which were needed to make our favorite drink.   A 3 star experience for sure. Not sure how Iberostar gets away with calling this a 5 star resort. It’s definitely not.;3
The following people in entertainment made our trip extra special Gabriela, Fabian, Angelo, Edgar, Alejandra, Ismael, Stefanie, Karen and May. While Liliana, Alicia and Reyes provided us with exceptional service. We would highly recommend this resort and the people are fun engaging and welcoming.;5
The staff were very friendly including Fabian, Angelo, Gabriella, Daniella and Alejandra. The facilities were excellent! Good food, drinks and shows at night. The views were beautiful! Hope to come back next year!;5
Girls trip. Perfect vacation spot for a girls trip.  Excellent entertainment staff. Shout out to Fabian, Angello, Gabriella, Daniella, Gabriel, Alejandra. Awesome tesm!  Thank you. Hope to visit again sokn.;5
"Unfortunately service, facility & food were not as good as when we visited in Aug 2021. It seemed short staffing in all restaurants & bars and there might be supply chain issue for food.    However, entertainment staffs & shows were great! Thank you for making our stay fun & enjoyable; Angelo, Gabriela, Fabian, Alejandra, Stephanie, Karen & Ismael!  We will be back!   Also, all instructors & staffs at Dressel Diver shop were wonderful.  They were very flexible at our request. Special thanks to Aki, Martin, Julen & Hector!";4
We had a wonderful time! We are definitely coming back! The hotel is very friendly, rooms are clean, food is delicious and the beach is beautiful !  Special thanks to the waiters Jonatan he was so great during our dinners , bartenders Leonel and Elisandra  at the beach bar and all animators.  I wish you guys would have  live music in the evening and the opportunity to dance));5
Karen,  Ismael, Alejandra were so amazing, and the rest of the staff were so accommodating. The entertainment was spectacular and the food was fresh. Best view of the Caribbean I’ve ever seen, we will be back!;5
We had to make an unexpected and last minute accommodation change to the Iberostar Resort and was happy we decided to book our vacation here.  We loved the individual bongaloos nestled throughout the tropical trees/plants.  Grounds were beautiful and lots of staff keeping them well manicured.  Lots of wildlife (peacocks, iguanas, birds, flamingos,  white-nosed coatis) throughout property. Rooms were basic but clean and you had everything you needed.  Great snorkeling off of resort beach but very rocky in the water however they have a pier for easy access to the water that puts you beyond the rocks. We always walked a ways down the beach to snorkel and floated with the current back to the resort…..Saw skates, starfish, trigger fish, rock fish, Barracudas and lots of beautiful;4
This hotel did not disappoint! The employees, Shotsy, Ismael, Alejandra, Angelo, and Karen were friendly and inviting. We made piñatas, played volleyball, had great drinks, and relaxed at the beach. We also went snorkeling, and the water was beautiful!;5
I will start with the things I enjoyed. The grounds are beautiful. I loved that you could get into the ocean from the dock. It made it very easy and there were a ton of fish hanging out by the dock. The staff was wonderful! Now for the things I did not enjoy. The bed was the worst I have ever slept in! Had I wanted to get eaten alive by mosquitoes I would have slept on the porch in the hammock LOL most important advice is to bring bug spray. It cost $30 in the gift shop. You can pick it up in town for $7. Because of the size of the resort and the Maze to get places. It would be helpful to have little signs that told you where things were. It is very easy to get lost. The buffet was okay. My favorite was breakfast. Other than that is very repetitive. We tried the steakhouse and;3
"We stayed at Iberostar Cozumel for a 14 night holiday during early August travelling from the UK as a couple. I will mention that due a 2 hour delay with our flight, and with the fact that we couldn’t fly directly into Cozumel from the UK only into Cancun; having to take several transfers using taxis and the Ferry meant we arrived after a total travel time of approximately 21 hours. This was our first consideration for revisiting Iberostar Cozumel in the first instance immediately realising that we had the return journey to face. On arrival, we were checked in, advised that we could have a meal as the dining room was still open and given our room keys. Initial impression was the hotel appeared very well presented on the approach, in the lobby and main buffet area, staff appeared";4
This is the second time this year we stayed this location.  The entire staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Resort location is perfect for diving.  We really enjoyed the evening entertainment in the lobby.  Can't wait to visit again!;5
My wife and I decided to stay at Iberostar Cozumel for our honeymoon and it was an absolutely amazing experience!!! Everyone from Antonio at the front reception counter to Fidel and Carlos in our dining area were fabulous!!! I highly recommend anyone and everyone to visit this resort if they wish to have an outstating experience with excellent customer service and hospitality.  The food was great with a variety of options.  We stayed in the presidential suite (thanks Antonio) and would never stay any other place other than this again.  The rooms were clean and the beach and entire resort was well kept and beautiful. Fidel definitely took care of us and we really hope to see him and Carlos again one day. We made some good friends and defiantly will be back very soon. A MUST stay;5
The trip was great. Easy check in and a wonderfully cold AC room which is needed after a hot sunny day. The chairs by the pool go fast so get there early. The pool gets warm in the afternoon so its better to cool off in the ocean which was beautiful. Restaurants were ok but the steak house and Mexican. Were the best!  Flamingo areas stinks but it didn't affect our travel.  Overall a great stay, very relaxing, and would definitely return!;5
If your looking for a one stop shop for your dive vacation check out this place.  Everything you need is right here. A place to sleep, restaurants, and a scuba shop on site.  Dressed Divers has a shop and dock right on the property.  You can also grab a taxi if you want to go into town for dinner but there is no need because Iberostar has all the food you can eat.  After all this is an all inclusive hotel.;4
It was nice ish but I wouldn't stay again. Way too many mosquitos at night, the smell was horrible and there is no a/c for the lobby and dinners. Which at first was nice until you try and have a nice dinner just to drip sweat the entire time. The beach was amazing and Elisandra who served us drinks was awesome. She works so hard in the heat. Our glasses were never empty. Miguel who was one of the waiters for the buffet was also amazing. Funny and personable, always got us to laugh. Just all around great at his job. The rest of the staff were nice but those 2 stood out the most.  The food was ok and that's what we expect from an all inclusive so no surprise. All in all not a 5 star resort but we did have a good time.;3
Last minute change of hotels, and so glad I made change  This is my 3rd iberostar property to visit. I like the setup… villas scattered throughout proprty with multiple units in each. Rooms were nice, quiet, beds comfortable. I like the purified water stations to refill bottle provided In the room. All inclusive breakfast and lunch well done. As with most all inclusives, a couple restaurants to choose from each night for dinner..or buffet. Same  menu, Predictable and good food. Surprisingly nice beach (rare in Cozumel), beautiful grounds. Iberostar a win.;5
We had a very fun vacaton with the teenage kids. The entertainment staff is excellent, really the best we have ever had! Kids loved Angelo, Alejandra and all the entertainers. Fun and entertaining shows, we loved them. We enjoyed water aerobics and games and a free scuba lesson in the large pool.   Food and drinks were really pretty good, breakfast was good, some choices got repetitive, but always something to eat. Rooms were perfect for families with ajoining rooms, comfy beds. Bring and wear mosquito spray in the evenings. Although they have some in the rooms, I wanted deet :)   Really beautiful grounds, buildings so cute, wonderful flowers, birds, animals walking around the resort. Snorkeling was amazing, but rocky, bring water shoes (we like crocs). We saw all kinds of fish,;4
THE GROUNDS AND PROPERTY.  GOOD: The landscaping is beautiful. It is very well maintained. It’s sort of a jungle paradise environment. The beach has nice sand on land. The pools are beautiful and well maintained. The location is close to the best scuba diving sites. All the facilities are nice and clean. The location is pretty remote and far away from the town. So if your goal is to stay on the property, then you’re fine.  BAD: The plants are watered daily. Also, there is rain. This allows mosquitoes to breed.  The mosquitoes are ferocious so you MUST use insect repellent. As well, when the property is wet from rain or morning watering, it smells of sewage. Probably because there is sewage nearby on the surface. The beach is nice on land but when you enter the water, you’ll need;4
We had visited Iberostar Cozumel a couple years ago so when we decided to elope it was the perfect place we had in mind.   The resort helps coordinate transportation to and from the airport which made it very easy for traveling with our parents and toddler.   Lina, the wedding coordinator, was absolutely amazing! She helped guide me through the planning process and made sure everything was planned from the rehearsal dinner, flower arrangements, cake (which is included), to the music played before and during the ceremony.  They have relationships with great vendors which made it easy to find a photographer and setup my hair and makeup at the resort's spa. We were able to plan the wedding in about six weeks and it was more beautiful than I could have imagined!   Lina was very;5
This is our second visit and we were so happy once again. We had an ocean front villa right by the pier. Everything was close as this is a smaller resort. The spa is small but the services are great. We are club members and enjoyed the club lounge being near the beach club member area. We loved the Mexican restaurant where the staff were so attentive to our needs and the food was authentic Mexican dishes. We had a birthday the night we went there and Fabian and his crew knocked it out of the park. Raul and Yuremi were so good in the club lounge handling all our needs.  We booked excursions through W2M in the lobby and were very pleased with the service and recommendations.;5
It's a great place, very beutiful, nice, clean. The staff also nice, Gabriela, Angelo very frendly. Many atractions for adults and kids. Restorants have a very fresh and delition food. Just one i does't like that staff wearing the masks, they looks like unhappy, it makes me unhappy too.;4
The resort is a beautiful paradise. Rooms are nice and food is great. Dive shop on property has everything you need for all diving and snorkeling excursions. It's a jungle paradise so bring bug spray. There is an Alamo car rental on site. Rent a Jeep Wrangler to tour the island. We did, and its alot of fun!;5
We as a family had an excellent vacation in this hotel. It’s a quiet place with the private beach and no strangers can access the beach, therefore it feels safe to be here. It has a pretty good selection of food, everyday is something different and tasty. The entertainment is great, everyday is a different show. During the day Gabriela, Ismael, Karen, Angelo, Fabian entertained kids with different kids activities like games, arts and craft, and the staff is very friendly and makes you to be welcome to the place. I would like to come back here!;5
We spent a long weekend (3 nights) with our kids (20 and 16 yrs old). Everything was as good as we could expect. The family room is actually two rooms connected. The rooms are nearly identical in size and layout, except that one has a king bed and the other has two double beds. Our room was in bulging 61, which is midway between the lobby and the pool/beach. We liked the location. The Beach is pretty with a few rocks (water shoes!) and absolutely clear. Very enjoyable. There are kayaks and small sailing boats for the gusts. Pool is nice and has a perfect balance…  not too loud and busy and not to silent! Bar service was always good. Every place we had a meal was great. My kids loved the snack bar at the beach, and I need to confess that we all ended up in love with the;5
The entertainment staff is amazing, they killed it and did an amazing job. Angelo, Favin, Gabriella, Alejandra is a queen, amber, Danielle. The DJs always had it going on, the shows were amazing. Love!!!;5
It was an amazing experience after our last visit about 8 years ago. Being part of The Prestige club is a plus.  The staff was wonderful: Starting with Yuremi from The Club, very professional, caring and always looking after us. Cindy from the breakfast  buffet, excellent service. Reyes at the Prestige bar, super service, but Ana, what a profesional, knowlegeable bar tender with a Huge heart!  The room was wonderful with the maid wonderful in her service. David and Capitán José gave us an excellent service with delicious margaritas from the bartender. The Oriental restaurant was delicious too! Unfortunately the Steak house was a little disapointed… my filet had a very funny taste, like alcohol or some fluid flavor.  Other than that we are definately coming back very soon;5
Very nice food, beach, activities, etc, mexican food is the best.  Definitely I wanna come back as soon as possible!  Ismael, Gabriela, Karen, Rosa and Stefanie are the best!  I loved the flamingos are so cute.;5
We had the most wonderful week at Iberostar. The grounds are beautiful, the food is great, the staff is so pleasant and the entertainment team (Angelo and all the performers) are so talented and give best shows every night.  We will sure return.;5
Josue & Adan best best bartender on resort, very good customer service. Makes sure drinks are good & makes sure you have a good time hanging out at the pool bar in the hotel iberostar. We have a had an amazing trip.;5
The resort is gorgeous! We had an excellent stay. Highlights include the many animals running around the resort (peacocks, flamingos, coatis, iguanas, etc.), Mando in the gym, practicing English and Spanish with each other while I exercised helped the time pass so quickly! And snorkeling with whale sharks, an excursion we arranged through the dive shop. Thank you for a wonderful week!;5
Our trip was made perfect because of Angelo, Fabian.  These 2 guys were always. Smiling and happy. They have the best customer I have ever seen. They made us laugh at the pool and et every place they were. I feel they made our stay perfect;5
Angelo, Fabian,Josue,Adan. All 4 were great customer service always smiling. They made of feel very welcome and always put a smile on our faces. They made our stay. 4 nights we stay here there the best;5
Just got back from an amazing stay! I can honestly say that I have never seen such hard working and dedicated staff who are always so friendly. The entertainment staff were outstanding especially Gabriella, Fabian, Alejandra and Angelo who went above and beyond to keep all guests entertained . They always took the time to chat and get to know you. The shows that the staff put on were fantastic especially the Rock show. The staff really are a credit to the resort. We loved our accommodation which was always perfectly clean and set in lovely well maintained grounds. It was great to see the local wildlife wandering around.;5
It’s our first time in Cozumel, 4th time in an All Inclusive Resort in the Caribbean and we wanted an AI option to make it easy to stay with the kids. We picked Iberostar based on research and reviews and never regretted it one bit. It is perfect? Probably not, but it met and in some ways exceeded our families expectations. We totally feel like we are getting our money’s worth. The rooms are basic, but have everything we need. The set up of the resort is beautiful and the grounds are immaculate. It’s a lot of fun for the kids to see animals and birds around the resort. The beach is beautiful, definitely rocky which we learnt is typical for Cozumel. There’s a pier to get in the water and see lots of fish. As far as the food, we can always find something we like. We tried all of;5
Stayed 8 nights and 7 days they had the best entertainment crew ever. Angelo, Edgar ,Gabriela,Alejandra was the best the room was nice and clean and be sure to use the app the steak house was wonderful along with the Mexican restraunt did not eat at the oriental restraunt but I’m sure it was great too no complaints here. The wildlife was amazing as well. We actually did not have to leave to have fun. But be sure to take water shoes for the beach and snorkeling was great as well.;5
Excellent service. Fabian was wonderful aerobics instructor. Would come back to his class. The whole staff was very hospitable. We loved Fidel from the dining hospitality team. The pool and beach was very clean and we felt well taken care of.;5
Stayed for 5 nights in late August 2022.   Our 1st experience was at the Iberostar Grand Paraiso so our expectations were slightly lower at this location.  Property is exactly what we were expecting, very tropical atmosphere, except for a few items all meals were very good and varied.  Staff was very  courteous.  Pro's:  Excellent location and beautiful beach, on site snorkeling and opportunities for offsite snorkeling and scuba diving.  As previous Iberostar, staff was always courteous and attentive.  Thanks to Jose, Captain of the Steak Restaurant who made sure I got my wine when I needed it, Jose was very polite, courteous, and attentive.  Really enjoyed the Rock show.  Alexandra kept the guest, big and small, entertained with games at night in the Lobby area.  Con's:  We had;5
Monolo hosted the sunset yoga and it was the experience of a lifetime. His calming voice and attitude was just amazing. It made the session fly by and by the end I couldn’t believe 1 hour went past. Definitely recommend!;5
Manolo gave us a beautiful sunset yoga experience, calming our bodies and mind. Looking forward to the other classes offered this week. This was my first beach yoga experience and 10/10!!!! My whole family enjoyed and loved the class.;5
We have been staying here for 10 days and have had an amazing time.  The shows are excellent in there theatre, which is in an amazing setting. The pool activity are amazing and great for all of the family. All the entreatment staff are so friendly and encourage you to try new activities. you really start to form friendships with them as they are so lovely and willing to talk to you especially Angelo, Gabriella , Fabion, Alejandro all four of these staff are a credit to the hotel.;5
I'll keep this review short and sweet.  Iberostar Cozumel felt like home.  The friendly and professional staff was welcoming, attentive and helpful. All of your hard work and energy is greatly appreciated.  To name a few, thank you to Alejandra, Fabulous Fabian, Angelo, Carlos, Gera, Cindy, Rosa, Rogelio and Alexander.  The food was fresh and deeeeeelicious!  The beach was breathtaking.  The rooms were clean and spacious. The evening shows were entertaining.  I would definitely go back.  Loved it all.  Thank you to all of the Iberostar Super Staff.  :);5
Very nice resort.  Entertainment staff was awesome especially Angelo.  The only thing I could say wrong was my son was on crutches so we asked for a wheel chair to make it easier for him to get around. They had a wheelchair but charged us $15 a day to use it.  Other than that everything was wonderful.;5
I was here for the weekend, all the staff has welcomed us as no one has ever done before, I felt at home every minute I spend there, especially thanks to the Guest Assistant Zuri and the Receptionist Rene, for the great service and recommendation about what to do & see that they gave us, they were really charming and helpful! The room, the restaurant, the pool, the breakfast....everything was perfect! Thank you again Iberostar!;5
Iberostar should not be advertising this as a five star resort- it is definitely not even close. Pros: Beach and dock area are nice for swimming and there are some fish to see but not much It is quiet at night time We found the beds comfortable but they need to provide better pillows.  Cons: Rooms are clean but very basic, there is no seating area in the room.  Steak restaurant food was bad Mexican restaurant food was bad Asian restaurant was just ok Service everywhere was slow Red wine was terrible , white ok Pool was dirty  Swim up bar was really dirty No activities for tweens or teenagers  Gym is not air conditioned and has a stench of sewage  Constant stench of sewage by tennis courts The resort credits that they give is just a worthless gimmick.  Mixed drinks were not good;2
Great holiday! We had a great time at the iberostar, from check-in to check-out. The food was good, the rooms clean and comfortable, perfect beach (swimming shoes are a must- but no seaweed at all- beautiful crystal clear water ! ). The staff was amazing, in particular the star camp for the kids (Ismael, Karen and Rosa) and star friends teams (Gabi and Fabian), they are so friendly that makes a huge difference in your stay :) !  Also there is a nice balance between activities and music around the pool area.;5
This is great property.  Love the little jungle concept with boongalows. So refreshing. Their Star Camp for kids is amazing. Kudos to Karen, Rosa and Ismael! You made it really memorable! We will come again!;5
Had a great time in Iberostar. The dinner was great. I made my both my reservations at the steak house as I read in previous reviews that it was the best one. The lunch buffet was a little more selective so we tended to eat more a breakfast and had a lighter lunch. The night time shows were great, Danny is very talented. The service was great, Glendy our main server always remembered us. The entertainment team was great, very friendly and went out of the way to make sure everyone was included. A special shout out to Gabby, Ismael, Karen and Fabian on the entertainment team that alway made sure we were having a good time!;5
Loved my stay at iberostar! Great food and fun! Activities and food! Loving the pools and drinks. Archery and crafts are great and im an adult. Snorkeling by the ocean and buffet at night! Fabian Ishmal and Gabby from actvities were so fun! Fernando was a great host at the buffet! Glendy and Milton were wonderful servers at dinner. The wildlife here is amazing! Iguanas flamingos! Danny from the rock show stole the show and all week for nightly entertainment.;5
Wonderfull resort, very commited to sustainability, trying to manege the always difficult balance between tourism and nature,  The staff is very professional, everything was perfectly clean. The food was great, with a lot of different choices that can satisfy the most demanding tastes.;5
Better than staying in Playa Del Carmen! The beach was so clear that we could see a LOT of fishes even star fishes. When we went snorkeling it was amazing there was a few different types of fishes and we even saw some stingrays! Make sure to take some water shoes because the beach is very rocky and you for sure do not want to be stung by a stingray. The rooms were nice too but our only concern is when we showered the water was cold then warm then hot for some reason. I also think the beds need more pillows we only got 2 for each bed and we were a group of 4 so we each got 1 pillow. The pool was also pretty nice there was a bar at the pool too I recommend to get a non  alcohol drink called fresada those were good. They also took your orders when you outside the pool chilling. My;5
The iberostar cozumel it's an amazing place to spend your holidays if you are planning to visit the Caribbean with your family or if you are looking to start or continue your subacuatic adventures diving. The resort has tons of entertainment activities, like trivias, shows, archery,volley competitions, etc. All of them family friendly. The entertainment team, specially Alejandra, puts a lot of work to make you feel the best way possible.  If your goal is to have an amizing diving experience, there are boars constantly leaving for diving, you can do many certifications and see a lot of the subacuatic life. As the only downsides, the diving center is not associated wit Padi and the beach entrance it's rocky (you can walk 15 mins and you'll have some amizing spots rock free);5
Iberostar was amazing! The entertainment team was awesome and kept us busy with lots of activities and shows! Food and drinks were great with a variety of different foods for every meal. Fabian, Gabriela and Angelo made this trip one to never forget!;5
Disappointed  Let me start by saying that I had stayed at this resort multiple times prior to the pandemic. On those occasions it was a well run, fun place to be with lots of great entertainment. Sadly it would seem that it has not recovered from the toll the pandemic took on it. Entertainment was very limited and not a patch on what it had been.  One other notable diff was the presence of people off cruise ships - I guess they pay to visit the resort which is unfortunate because they put a strain on an already very lean staff not to mention there’s not enough sun chairs to go around either!  Very disappointing experience and we will prob never return.  Definitely not what it used to be - not even close.;3
Grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Staff was very friendly. Steakhouse was delicious!  Star friends, Angelo, Gabriella and Fabian made our days and evenings! Days at activities, they kept everyone involved.  Pool games were a blast! Evening shows were great! Highly recommended for family/friends. We had a group of 10.;5
Have stayed here 3 times. It is small and the facilities not up to the (high) standards of other Iberostar resorts. But it offers great value and the size may suit families with smaller kids. Food is OK - we always found something good to eat at the buffet.  We enjoy taking the Ultramar ferry over from Playa - all part of the holiday journey.  Decent snorkelling and Dressel are on hand for scuba - we tried their discover scuba package - recommended. We are already planning our next trip there.;4
My review for the past week   Food Was mediocre at best I did enjoy the Asian restaurant and I have to say the staff in the specialty restaurant was much more attentive than the Buffet that is to be expected.￼ The staff in the Buffet almost refused to bring you anything to drink on most days and I’m more concerned about where you’re sitting  than if you’ve actually have silverware. I have had worse food at resorts but it was simply just not the best.  The rooms were very clean and well done but however most of the people I talk to and myself included found the air-conditioning to be so poor it could not even keep the sheets dry on the bed. Clothes hung up to dry when simply remain exactly as damp as they were￼￼. They did a very good job cleaning the rooms and we’re very;3
Iberostar Star camp for kids is lovely as it is small, fun and  warm. The team is super personable, professional and show great respect for childhood constantly ensuring that kids are happy and having fun in a safe environment. Ismael, Rosa and Karen are the very best!;5
In general the resort was a beautiful place to visit. The drinks were to die for and the fruit is the best I’ve had. The cleaning service was amazing considering the sand we would track in from the beach! The pool activities were fun and a good challenge and the beach activities were also enjoyable.  The shows were also so much fun but disco night was the best. And a special mention to Angelo and Alejandra for being the bestest!;5
This was my first time at an Iberostar resort and from reviews and price I  was expecting to be blown away compared to where I usually stayed. The service was good, the food at the buffet breakfast/lunch/dinner was good. I could only get white wine, no choices as to the type. The Steak house was sub-par with the steak not being very good, and very slow service. The Asian restaurant was very good, and the Mexican restaurant was good. The quality of the cocktails varied significantly from one bar to another, some of them were undrinkable.   Our room was missing the door guard at the bottom so there was an inch gap at the bottom which allowed in many many mosquitoes, unfortunately we didn't notice this until 2 days before we left.  The entertainment was good, however we had a bad;3
Just returned from a relaxing and fun filled vacation from Cozumel Iberostar with family and friends.  The star friends were great especially Angelo, Gabriela Fabio and Ismal.  They made the pool games fun and the night shows awesome.  Bartender Leonel made the best drinks.;5
We stayed for two weeks with our teenagers, diving was amazing the best, our teenage son qualified for his open water, brilliant access to the reef, snorkelling from the beach for non fivers. Very tranquil, not built up lovely sunset walks along the beach.  everything very well run food excellent staff v helpful and friendly. Beach volleyball and tennis particularly favourite for us, beautiful gardens with wildlife v tame, peacocks flamingoes iguanas raccoons !;5
We had a fantastic time at this resort! We especially enjoyed the entertainment team. Big shout out to Gabriella, Fabian, and Angelo who made sure we were all having a great time. The food was tasty and they had a wide variety to choose from. The drinks were plentiful and well-poured. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It is clear that the staff takes pride in their work. We will definitely be back and will gladly recommend this resort to others!;5
Food was amazing, facilities amazing.  The staff were great. Manolo from a fitness center was a favorite of all the staff. He was a joy to talk to and amazing yoga and Zumba instructor. Highly recommend his classes.;5
We absolutely loved the Iberostar! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. We took our 2 year old daughter on this trip, and everyone treated her excellent and made all of us feel so welcome. We loved it;5
"This was our chosen destination for a long delayed family reunion. The layout may seem like a maze, specially at night, but it grows on you. The sight of the local fauna, the iguanas, flamingos, coatis and so on, as well as the lush vegetation is always heartwarming and keeps you on your feet.  The food could be better; I'm looking at you cheese, non-local frozen seafood, and a couple others. There is a definite need to source more product locally, such as fruits and fish.  Most of the staff was an outright pleasure to interact with. I have to particularly mention Manolo, the gym, pilates, and yoga instructor, for the customized and effective exercises he showed me to take care of a chronically painful lower back. Oh, and Rosa, all smiles and kindness.  In all, a great";4
Had a fabulous time at this resort. The restaurants/buffets were tasty and the hammock outside each of the residences, was a nice touch.  I came to Cozumel for the diving and the dive company on-site, Dressel Divers, was fantastic. The staff was friendly and helpful and each of the Divemasters, that I dove with, was knowledgeable and embodied what a Divemaster should be.  I usually try not to stay in the same place twice, but if I do make it back Cozumel some day, I may break that habit.;5
I liked it a lot. I made a lot of friends. Food was amazing  . We love alejandre. She did an amazing job. We had fun at the bar with all of our fiends and at all of the shows that the people hosted. The beach had a lot of rocks but it was still fun;5
Cute, clean, quaint place with amazing hospital people! The animals and greenery really make it unique and beautiful to walk through. Shoutout to the entertainment team esp Angelo, Alejandra and Gabriella! Thx for all the laughs. Buffet food was amazing - thx chef Saul!! Wi-Fi and mobile app could improve. Overall great time and experience.;4
We just finished a six day trip to the Iberostar Cozumel with our daughters, ages 8 and 12.  The staff was so great, and there was something for everyone to enjoy.  My youngest LOVED the Star Camp for kids.  She made lots of friends and enjoyed the unique activities that changed daily.  Ismael and Rosa were AMAZING!!  They went above and beyond to make sure that the kids had an absolute blast all week.  The entertainment crew, especially Angelo and Fabian (water aerobics superstar), were fantastic, and Isidro at the swim up pool bar kept the drinks flowing for both the kids and adults.  The ocean is clear as drinking water, and you can snorkel right off the hotel dock.  We are sad to leave but can’t wait to return!;5
This is our second time staying at the Iberostar and both times were great. The rooms are comfy and clean, the food is surprisingly good for an AI, the staff are helpful and welcoming. We used Dressel for many dives and they too were excellent!;5
Wow!  Another amazing stay at the Iberostar!  Check-in was quick and easy with Isabel.   Love the new wristbands with the room key attached.   The staff is always so nice and once again made our stay perfect.  We come twice a year and many of the staff have become part of our family.   Angelo is the best and always keeps us entertained and laughing.   You’ll miss out if you don’t try his water aerobics.  Look for Gabriela and Fabian around the pool…. They are amazing.   Cindy is our go to for breakfast and lunch, guarantee she’ll take great care of you.  Our room was clean, air conditioning worked great.  Housekeeping kept our fridge stocked.    We don’t make reservations at the restaurants as the buffet has a great selection and never disappoints.   If you have time make a;5
Iberostar Cozumel was my family's favorite place we have stayed in Cozumel. The beach is just unbeatable. It had everything we needed for a relaxing vacation: good food options, unlimited drinks, opportunities for exercise - I loved playing beach volleyball with Angelo, Edgar, and Alejandra, and as a family we loved yoga on the beach with Manolo (highly recommend!). The entire staff was friendly and helpful. We keep talking about when we can go back.;5
The Cozumel location is the perfect place to unwind and relax. The entertainment team- Angelo, Fabian, Alejandra, Karen, Ismael are great! All the waiting staff, housekeeping and ground keepers do an amazing job daily! The Spa ladies Beatriz, Paola and Rufina have magical hands. The Prestige concierge were all great as well as Ana in the VIP bar. Ana was great to talk to and always made the best drinks. My father-in-law had a fall by the pool and the whole team came to our rescue and made sure he was taken care of immediately. That was the best service ever! Again, many props to the entire Iberostar team.;5
The Iberostar Resort in Cozumel was fabulous in so many ways! The workers were always pleasant, smiling n courteous. The food was terrific with a great variety. The rooms and grounds were clean n fresh. The entertainment was lively and fun and the Dressel Divers are superb. I give this resort a 5+.;5
Had a great vacation. The entertainment group was amazing and there were plenty of activities for adults and children. Shout out to Angelo, Fabian , Gabriella , Alejandra , and Vladimir the DJ, they were always smiling and ready to go.  All in all, great time;5
This is a beautifully unique resort with great staff, good food and everything you need for a relaxing time. Me and my wife thought the food was good, the drinks were very good with very friendly bartenders who remembered what we liked and didn’t mind making them as strong as you could handle. The water was crystal clear and the beach setup was very nice. The first 15-20 feet of water is very rocky so maybe think about bringing water shoes. If you don’t it’s no problem because they have a dock and stairs that will get you in past the rocks. Once in the water you’ll literally be swimming with the fishes as tropical fish swim right around you in the crystal clear water. My wife and I didn’t do any diving but spoke to several people that did and they all said it was great. Bring;4
Everything was clean and all staff were friendly.  We never felt rushed or felt like we were in a big crowd.  The entertainment staff were friendly, talented and funny.  The hamburger grill was delicious!  All restaurants had great food.  This was a perfect vacation for our family.;5
We loved this resort. The villas are so much nicer than a regular hotel. The beach has a good amount of seating. We never had a problem finding chairs. The beach is rocky so water shoes are a must for the beach. The dive shop has snorkeling gear, kayaks and small catamarans for free. However, you have to pay a $5 pp eco fee in cash to use them and can only use during certain times (9:30-11:30 & 1:30-3:30) which was no problem, I just wish I would have known to avoid wasting time.  Beach and Pool Bars could definitely use a second bartender at all times. It was almost impossible to get a drink at the swim up bar in the pool.  Food in general is good. It is hot in August and the breakfast buffet and the steakhouse  restaurants have no AC, so yes it was hot.  The Asian and Mexican;5
Very picturesque place, you walk and you find a lot of beautiful fauna. For its part, the sea is accessed through a pier because there are many stones. I want to highlight Manolo, the gym instructor, very willing to help, paying attention to how we do the exercises and providing all his wisdom with great dedication.;5
"Great as a dive resort.  Food and grounds real nice. Nice beach 20 min walk away, beach in front of hotel is real rocky. Night life is nilly.  Rooms are bungalow style, lots of walking. 20 dollar taxi ride away from town. Biggest complaint would be how they slow down the bar service on the beach; there is always a wait.";4
So where to begin?  The property itself is lovely in the common areas & the front desk staff were friendly and efficient, but the lobby, buffet and lunch dining facilities are open air and therefore uncomfortably hot - as in swelteringly hot & humid.   The room itself (2601) smelled of mildew and the thermostat was locked so we couldn’t adjust the room temperature down to our preferences. That said, we did adjust to the temperatures after about three nights. There were small bugs on the bureau. Not good at all!   We asked for extra pillows one night, had to call twice and a third time the next day before we finally got them for the next night.   On the third day we asked that they restock our fridge with Diet Coke and they pushed back saying we would have to exchange other items;3
The dive shop keeps this place in business otherwise the slow service, lack of air conditioning, poor bar and food availability would run off many people.  They only staff each bar with one bar tender so getting a drink is painfully slow.  The restaurants do not have air conditioning so you will be sweating while eating.  Food is hard to get at (the good stuff runs out quickly and they are very very slow to replenish, most of the good food is behind plexiglass so you have to wait for a restaurant employee to get it for you but they are always tied up busy with something else so you wait and wait).  They rarely refill your drinks in the buffet restaurants.  Water is always cool/lukewarm but never cold and keep in mind you are sitting in a dining area with no air conditioning.;2
We have stayed at Iberostar Maya twice and found the Cozumel Iberostar to be very underwhelming. It’s a smaller resort so we were expecting less but not to the level we encountered.  The beach is lovely with clear water and lots of fish to see under the pier.  The staff is friendly and the entertainment team, especially Angelo, are lots of fun.  We enjoyed the shows but there is not one every night.  I like that Iberostar is anti-plastic and they have re-fillable glass water bottles in your room.  Not a big deal to walk to a water station to fill up.     Now, the disappointing aspects.  We had connecting rooms and one had a mildew smell. We soon find out it was because the AC was leaking from the ceiling creating a mess on the bathroom floor.  Maintenance was quick to respond;3
So many fun things to do!  Beautiful place! This is the most beautiful, welcoming and thoughtful resort.  The kid’s club is wonderful!  Ismael and Rosa are so patient and great with the children.  Activities like archery, sandcastle building, tie-dying - always something going on.    The resort is absolutely beautiful in an old world Mexico kind of way.  Our room was elegantly simple and just right. The air conditioning worked well.    Everyone is friendly, the other tourists are polite and gregarious.  Drinks are excellent, food is delicious.  I have never been to an AI resort that served jumbo colossal shrimp nightly on a buffet.  Bbq by the beach during the day.    Wonderful snorkeling really got off of the resort pier and picturesque beach.  It does not get much better,;5
Manolo is fantastico. Yoga classes in the moraine are a perfect way to start your day and wake up your body. It will fit you if you are a starter or an advanced yogi. You will do it next to beach in a perfect setting in full harmonie with thé surrounding nature. You will be able to listent to the sea waves, to bords, to Manolo directions in Spanish and English. You will be able to do it at the sunset to finish your day on a high before a good refreshment on the beach. Highly recommended;5
Stayed here as a Scuba Dive destination. The facilities were fine, the staff was very accommodating and did their best to assure our stay was pleasant. The rooms and grounds are well kept and clean. We've stayed here 10 or 12 times so the food, although fresh and abundant, did become repetitive. I would definitely recommend this resort for a stress free stay.;3
We stayed in a suite, second floor, and they were painting our building the whole time, there were tarps everywhere, dripping paint on our scuba gear that was drying on our deck area, I almost fell once trying to navigate the tarp lying across the stairway.  It was just not necessary, could they go paint another unoccupied building?  That being said, we loved the suite (our 17th time staying here). The food has improved greatly!  The Star Friends were staffed low, I felt sorry for the ones working so hard, they were really fun, and Angelo is a hoot!  We just wished the painters (hard working don't get me wrong, not their fault, I'm sure they are told where to go, what to paint) had stayed out of our way more.  My husband is a contractor, he said the project manager could have;3
WE LOVED OUR STAY HERE!! it was a super awesome resort. The food is good at the buffet and restaurants. The snack bar was on point! and we don’t drink so all the virgin drinks and sodas we got were delicious!! We had a standard room here and it was just right!! last but not least the ENTERTAINMENT TEAM WAS SOOO GREAT!! From the pool games to the nightly entertainment it was the best just to mention a few, Angelo, Alejandre, Gabriela, and Fabian. They are all amazing and knew us by name just after a couple days and became our very best friends!!;5
Manolo’s yoga class was wonderful. he went through each pose step by step and made sure we were comfortable. i enjoyed his class thoroughly and will be taking his pilates and yoga classes for the rest of my stay.;5
We are visiting currently and having a wonderful time! The entertainment team has made our days fun filled and the evenings have had amazing shows! Thank you! Rosa, gabbi, Fabian, Karen, ismael we’re so fun while painting!;5
Very nice place to stay staff went above and beyond. Nice pool with an ocean view, water tours snorkeling, fishing etc., can pick you up right at their dock.  Food needs a little work, room clean and comfortable.;5
This resort is great for families. It's a beautiful jungle setting with bungalow rooms. It's not extravagant luxury but laid back relaxed vibe. The staff are all great especially Alejandro and the entertainment staff. The food is ok, nothing to write home about. They do a fantastic job of being as eco friendly as possible.;4
Our first visit to Iberostar Cozumel was an absolute delight! The property is so well kept and beautifully landscaped providing a wonderful habitat for the birds and animals roaming around.  The food options are more than adequate with surprisingly healthy and tasty offerings.  The buffet, beach snack shack, and Asian restaurant were our favorites! Our rooms met all of our needs and we especially loved the hammocks on the front porch, taking our 'lounging' time outside to enjoy the landscape and wildlife. Use the provided mosquito repellent .  Any AC issues we had were addressed quickly and to our satisfaction- understanding It is a humid tropical island.   We are not big on group activities or entertainment, but the staff had us hooked and we enjoyed and appreciated their hard;5
One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Located 10 min taxi ride from the center of Cozumel. Beautiful property with very interesting layout and beautiful manicured gardens. Many animals on the property snd my kids were somhappy to watch the flamingoes and different birds. Great swimmingpools for the kids and you can snorkel and see fish just on the beach. The food is lovely, clean and a lot to choose from. The staff is so polite snd helpful with everything. My kids 6 and 11 years spent some time in the kods club and had a great time. The staff is very attentive and kind. A special thank you to Rosa, Karen and Ismael for making the stay extra super for our kids. There is also a lot of entertainment during the day like beachvolley, yoga and water aeeobics. It is a super relaxing;5
Had a great vacation. This resort was recommended by a friend who's a dive instructor and it was amazing even though we don't die. The resort is beautiful and the rooms are incredible. I met Manolo at the gym and he helped me with some Fitness and some language skills. Highly recommend the yoga on the beach.  I'm at Rossa on Thursday at the yoga on the beach. They have a whole place here for kids and she works there. She clearly enjoys what she does.  Resort was great, but I'm ready to get back to my normal food after 7 Days of the phase. My wife and daughter are already lobbying for a couple extra days next year.;5
We traveled as a group of 14 ranging in age from 15 to 68. When making reservations for dinner there was mass confusion by the staff as to whether there were 13 or 15, there were 14, this couldn't be changed in the computer. 2 of the rooms the ac did not work and the maintenance staff had to be called twice, 1 room had electrical issues. The bell staff were very curious in assisting my mother back and forth by picking her up in the golf cart. The wait staff at the beach and pool were great and efficient! The restaurants did not want to seat a table of 14 they would seat 2 tables of 7.  The grounds were beautifully kept, the wildlife on the resort are plentiful.  Overall my family and friends had a good time with a few bumps along the way.;3
My overall experience was very good. The check in was horrible, I arrived at 2 pm I was told to wait till 3 at was told 4pm. At 4pm requested to speak to a manager at this point we were the only ones waiting for a room. Other people that had the same issue were being compensated with upgrades. I was not even offered an apology. The hotel is very clean the pool is very well maintained and the beach is clean of sargassum.  If you want continuous service at the beach and pool area I would suggest to bring dollars to tip as that is the driver for waiters. We are in room 8414 ocean view pool view great for access to beach chairs. The restaurant all have great variety and easy access to get reservations.  Entertainment team is what made our stay memorable, Fabian,Angelo, Alejandra,and;4
This is my fourth visit to Iberostar Cozumel and it was even better this time around. My sister and I went together just to relax and unwind. We spent most of our time on the beach or in the ocean. The water is crystal clear with lots of beautiful fish, starfish, rays, etc. No fancy gear needed, just a $30 mask and snorkel and we were in heaven.  I enjoyed having a custom-made omelet every morning, and my sister swears the burger at the beach snack hut was the best she’s ever tasted. I’m sure we were starving after being in the water so long!  I’d planned on going to Alberto’s next door but was pleasantly surprised by the number of dinner seafood options they had this time.  As usual, the abundance of wildlife was a huge delight. I was especially happy to see the coatis running;5
I have to say and I have been here four times! In 2004, 2012,2016 and 2022.  The rooms look cozier than before, super clean, small and comfortable.   All the waiters do their best, so make sure you tip them.   The Star Camp staff (Ismael, Rosa, and Karen) took amazing care of my four year old, they are really sweet and made my daughter feel comfortable to spend the day with them. She really  liked the bracelet activity, making puzzles, the passport and playing with balls in the pool. Do not hesitate to leave  your children here. They were really kind and my daughter was super happy with them.  I am so impressed about how eco friendly they are. They’ve got responsible fishing, they have eco friendly amenities, and they are trying to be a waste free hotel in 2025.   The beach is;5
Service wasn't good. There were waiters and waitresses around  but they were not helpful it was easier just to get up yourself and get what you wanted. The bar was always super slow. Not sure if they were short on staff or its always like this but slow and pretty much easier just to do it yourself. They also say on website activities are free but there is a national park so you have to pay a national park fee per day. It's also very rocky beach because of this. It was pretty but they should let you know before you get there and not say the water activities are FREE. THEY ARE NOT!! Its near impossible to get reservations at the places to eat too. Your choices were always buffet. We did get one night of reservations at steak house and there was two other tables and the rest were;2
This was our first time staying in Cozumel and it was a great experience! Loved the resort, night time activities, especially the rock concert, food was great, drinks were adequate, beach area was beautiful and it was not overcrowded. Bed was comfortable with adequate size bedroom. We will be back!;5
Everything staff Gabriela and Fabian are awesome. Great job entertaining. Rooms were clean, Dressel drivers are awesome. Especially Flo and Santiago! Thanks for making our trip awesome. Will be back soon.;5
I came to Cozumel to get dive certified with Dressel Divers and had an amazing time! Great staff both at the dive shop and throughout the resort. Lots of entertainment throughout the day and into the night and one of the staff members, Anglelo, was so much fun. Great food and drinks. I’d definitely come again. I love that iberostar is environmentally friendly as well.;5
This resort was amazing!! We had plenty to do on and off the resort!  With the help of Gabriel and Fabian we where completely entertained every day in and out of the pool. Thank you so much and will see you next year.;5
This hotel was pretty awesome. I was surprised about how sustainable they are. Beautiful layout with all kinds of animals that run through there (flamingos, parrots, iguanas) kinda cool to see up close. Food was awesome and drinks. I was able to dine in all the restaurants during my stay. Had a variety of options which is great. The best part is that there are so many activities to do at the resort. They have activities for kids and adults. My teenaged son loved to do them all! The staff who hosted alot of the activities (hope I got the names right) Angelo, Fabian, Gabriella and I can't remember the name of the lady that usually host the night games in the lobby I think Alejandra . All 4 of them were very fun to be around and super nice. They were the friendliest and definitely;5
This place and the staff are so awesome. The staff is so polite and always looking to get you included in activities and make sure your happy. Angelo has made me feel so welcome and keeps putting a smile on my face. The night entertainment is the best part of the whole resort. The bartenders are very quick and make the best drinks. If you are wanting to have the best time of your life visit Iberostar in Cozumel!!!;5
Seventh time coming here and each visit becomes a new experience. Exceptional staff and a very cheerful entertainment team. Their rock and boogie shows ara spectacular. Ale, Ângelo, Fabian, Gabriel, Gabriela, Ismael, Karen, Rosa, Manolo, Daniel, Estefany, Ámbar.;5
If you like to be in a room with ants everyday then go to this resort.  Foods were bad, the buffet is not good, having same things for 7 days is not pleasant.  Room was so small, air conditioning was not working, we had to call and keep on calling until they sent someone to work on it. Not worth it.;2
Great time, friendly  staff. Special thanks to Alejandranda and the entertainment team who made a pleasant stay. Rooms are excellent. Restaurants are very clean and the scenery is amazing. If you go try out the las dos Maria's Mexican restaurant. You would ve amaze;5
We love the atmosphere here and come back everytime. It’s not a typical hotel feel and we love that. You can snorkel right off the beach. Also you can walk down the beach and eat at a local restaurant! The massage is a must!;5
Our family just returned from a wonderful stay at Iberostar Cozumel. Rooms were cool, clean, and comfortable.  The food was varied, fresh, and delicious. Something for  everyone. Staff, Angelo, Eduardo, all bartenders, food service, front desk were helpful and accommodating.  The entertainment was different every night and we loved every show. There is diving with Dressel Divers straight from the dock. Snorkeling directly under the dock is some of the best. Look for star fish they are all over. Be sure to bring water shoes and your own snorkel.This resort is full sustainability as well, adding to the quality. You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here.;5
A beautiful place and everything was great other than the bed and pillows were hard as rocks. Good food and good service. Resort employees were always pleasant and helpful. The dive shop on the resort was outstanding as well.;4
"Excellent resort for the mature crowd. We enjoyed snorkeling & basic scuba diving. We love early morning swims in ocean with local sea life. I recommend snorkeling excursion & basic dive class/excursion. Our 30 -45 yrs old youngsters did several dives & advanced excursion scuba diving(excellent diving team at Iberostar;Dressell diving.";5
The resort is great...back to pre-COVID levels. We loved the activity & entertainment staff--Alejandra, Angelo, Eduardo, Alejandra, Amber & Danny. They offer games and activities during the day and night and awesome nightly shows in the theater. The bartenders & staff are wonderful. The grounds are lovely. Lots of wildlife! Definitely recommend the Iberostar Cozumel!;5
Absolutely phenomenal, Alejandra was a perfect entertainer and treated everyone as if they were a celebrity. She absolutely deserves a raise and is the greatest asset at this resort. She is purely the reason I’ll be coming back.;5
The beautiful Alejandra & the amazing Angelo made our trip worth it! They were so much fun & brought so much energy! Definitely would come back just to see them! Edgar is awesome as well. This was our second time here at Iberostar Cozumel & it gets better everytime!;5
We just stayed here in July 2022. The resort is very nice and situated in lush garden that make for serene surroundings. The beach is wonderful with excellent snorkeling right from the dock. What really made this trip for us was the kids Star Camp that was offered at Iberostar. Rosa and Karen were absolutely phenomenal with my kids and had great activities planned daily. My husband and I were able to dive when the kids went to start camp. Without this amenity we would not have been ablate dive together. The tie-dye t-shirts were such a great souvenir and my kids cannot wait to come back. The food at the resort lacked as did the coffee sadly but other than that it was a great trip.;4
Wanted a good couples get away nice resort staff not so much & beds not good at ALL. Food was so so drinks was ok. Just expecting better trip such as cancun but was just ok not good. Staff was not very friendly acted like chore if you ask for anything;2
This was my first time visiting and I know we will be returning next year! Everything is nearby and so convenient.  The entertainment group was amazing keeping us all informed of activities.  Thank you to Fabian, Alejandra, Edgar and Angelo on a excellent job done!   Danny and Amber did a great job singing in the Horror Show! I was most impressed with the acrobatic skills. Edgar, Angelo and the their female team member did great! Excellent! It was amazing!;5
We 100% plan to be back next summer!!  This place is amazing.  The staff is so friendly - they give attention to every detail.  We had so much fun with the entertainment staff - Alejandra, Angelo, Fabian and Edgar were the life of the party every day.  The pool and beach games are fun and different each day - you just never know what’s going to happen, and it’s always inclusive of EVERYONE that wants to play.  We made dream catchers, played soccer bowling, and learned to samba and bachata.  We had so much fun as a family!   The waitstaff is impeccable - we loved Glendy, Milton, Adolfo, and Dierde (sp?) each day in the buffet.  They were were so observant and accommodating.  Liliana at the bar by the pool was one of my favorites - she ALWAYS had a smile and was so quick to pick;5
Need better quality of food and more options of sit down restaurants rather than buffet. I struggled to find food i liked.  Prefer air conditioned dining vs open air. Pool could stand a chiller for really hot months, kinda like bath water. Overall a great trip and beautiful grounds.;3
Our experience with the resort was perfect!  The star camp was great - Ismael and Rosa were so helpful!!  Having dressel diver on site was awesome!  Room was clean and the restaurants were awesome.  I loved the size of the resort - everyone was so friendly!;5
This was our 5th summer at Iberostar Cozumel and once again we had a spectacular vacation. We spent the days lounging on the beach sipping cocktails or participating in one of the many activities led by the fabulous entertainment team. Fabian and Angelo kept it fun during some water exercise and Alejandra made the afternoon games a blast. These three worked their booties off from day to night. We also had an amazing server, Rogelio, at the morning and lunch buffet. He even introduced us to a new drink that was sure to chase away any hangover. I cannot wait to come back next summer. Our family has tried other  resorts but nothing compares to the atmosphere at Iberostar Cozumel.;5
This was our first time to Cozumel and first time in MX! The staff at Iberostar are one of a kind, world class, and truly make you feel at home. During our stay, Alejandra checked in with us anytime we saw her, asked us questions about the activities we did outside of the resort, she was the best. This was our first time at an all-inclusive type of resort, it is amazing for about 3 days then we got restless! Thankfully, we were able to arrange a car AT the resort, get Taxi's easy to downtown to explore, and the staff were always willing to help answer our questions. Not only are we sold on Iberostar Cozumel, we are sold on Iberostar. Gracias, Cozumel!;5
Restaurants a little disappointing - only 2 fine dinner reservations allowed for a 4-night stay. But the buffets are fine. A great value experience. Friendly staff. Pools, beaches and restaurants not overcrowded. Facilities well-kept, rooms clean. Took a while to learn our way around. Would return.;4
Iberostar has a beautiful layout that makes you feel like you are in the jungle.  There is wildlife all around. The beach area is great and the pier is an extra bonus.  There are tons of fish that hang out under the pier which makes for some great snorkeling.  The entertainment crew is AWESOME and we directly interacted with Edgar and Angelo.  The shows were fun but I am not sure that the Horror show(not really scary) is appropriate for kids.  We watched one family leave right after the opening scene. Edgar and Angelo did a great job getting our 21-year-old and 18-year-old involved in daily activities.  Our daughter even won a hula hoop contest.  Our room(5304) was just average.  The AC worked great, but the bed was very hard.  The rooms were VERY clean. For some reason, we only;3
We had an amazing vacation!! The Entertainment is great. Angelo, Edgar, and Alejandra are so much fun between archery, volleyball, pool games and the shows at night they are humble and so much fun!!!!;5
We had a great stay! The food was good and it’s conveniently located near some of our favorite beaches. The pier makes pick up for local excursions simple and easy.  I look forward to visiting Iberostar Cozumel again :);4
We went to this resort because it has Dressel dive shop on site. The hotel property is kinda cool with all the wildlife and cute, updated cottages but there are a lot of downfalls. First, they only let you make reservations three times, we were there for 7 nights, was really disappointing, we had to eat the same thing every day. Nothing has air conditioning! Even the steak house is open, it is brutally hot! They have fans but nothing works! The lobby where they do activities at night is miserable! Again, most fans are broken. Same with the show/stage area. The daily activities are weak and boring. This resort needs a lot of updates and way more fun activities. It was ok but I would not go back. Also, the pool is literally like a hot tub, way to hot! The best part is the ice and;3
Spent a week here at the resort with the family including our pre-teen child.   Swim up bar was always a gathering place and the drinks were poured heavily.   Food options were plentiful and should please the pickiest of eaters. In other boards, some complained on the food. I found nothing wrong and was surprised to find artisanal items like Jamon from Spain and great cheese. Remember, this isn’t the US and things aren’t necessarily done the “American” way.   The entertainment team works their tails off every day. They do a great job of keeping the resort fun and friendly. For example, Angelo who you’ll see everywhere leading activities by the pool or beach is also a talented dancer who preformed 5 of the 7 nights at the evening show.   The kids club (Star Club) worked hard to;5
We had a wonderful week at Iberostar. Manolo’s fitness classes were a nice way to start the day. I wish he taught one every morning.  I really liked the live music in the evenings, David was my favorite.  Everyone is very friendly, especially the entertainment staff Edgar and Angelo.  My family loves the scuba diving and it is so convenient on site.  This was our third trip there and I’m sure we’ll be back.;5
I stayed at the Iberostar in Cozumel with my family for a week and had an amazing time. The resort offers so many activities and opportunities that you won’t find at many other all inclusives. When we weren’t relaxing on the beach or at the swim up bar, we took advantage of the fitness classes (I think we did every single class offered by Manolo, including Pilates, yoga, and Zumba), water aerobics with Angelo, snorkeling right off the resort, and enjoying the entertainment team’s incredible performances. We got to know Edgar from the team really well throughout our trip. In addition to the show every night, there were games and live music in the lobby. I also did a resort dive with Flo, who was an incredible teacher both in the pool sessions and during our time in the water!;5
This was third trip to the island and our second time staying here. We are happy to report it was better than our first trip 7 years ago!   The grounds were still gorgeous and well maintained, the food was better than we remembered. The main buffet was our favorite!! The staff were incredibly nice, Ivonne was the sweetest host , the evening shows put on by the entertainment team were so much fun to watch especially Angelo! Thanks for another beautiful trip we will be back soon!;5
My trip was so amazing! All of the staff was so friendly and the entertainment team was very entertaining and fun. There was always so much to do I was never bored! Very thankful for my trip to iberostar cozmuel;5
"Pros Location, food on buffet was wonderful- huge variety, cute ""huts"", eco- friendly amenities, beach, snorkeling and diving on location and the reef was close by. Cons no regulators in shower- hot/cold right after each other, bellhops put 4 people and 5 pieces of luggage in a small taxi- too hot";4
Iberostar Cozumel never disappoints us. We had an amazing time!  Ask for Manolo Carmana at the gym or follow him to the pool to participate in water aerobics or morning yoga and afternoon zumba. Wow!  Overall, it was an amazing trip. Ask for “Ro” (Rojelio)  or Cindy or Ivonne during breakfast buffet or lunch buffet! The entertainment team was awesome!  Ask for Angelo or Alejandra! - Diane, Melissa, Becky, and Jason;5
Overall, we enjoyed our time spend in Cozumel and Iberostar and wish to return sometime in the future. Everyone in my family was able to find activities to enjoy. We found the facilities to be all we wanted for fun, relaxation, and quality time with family.;4
Loved the food. Everyone is friendly and accommodating. We loved our rooms! So cute! It was clean. I love that the hotel was eco friendly.  Manolo the yoga and Pilates instructor was amazing!! Very kind and professional!;5
"We liked the jungle like feel of the separate cabana like rooms and the hammock on each porch! We enjoyed all the animals on the resort (flamingos, peacocks, iguanas, coatis). The activities staff were amazing! Shout out to Alejandra who made all the games fun (pool volleyball, water aerobics, can jam, Pictionary, etc) The steakhouse was our favorite restaurant at the resort. It was delicious; we went two nights! The buffets had a good variety. We enjoyed the beach and swim up bar. I would recommend bringing water shoes for walking into ocean since it’s rocky. We were able to go snorkeling and parasailing by being picked up on the resort dock which was so convenient!";5
"So first of all, this was only my second holiday abroad. But this is by far setting the standard high!  Accomodation: 3.5/5  This was the weakest area of the holiday, but not for many reasons. The room, whilst clean and always topped up with towels, soft drinks, and beer, still had a few issues. My iron was not working, and the ironing board is pretty pathetic.  Also had issues with the toilet randomly deciding to not fill the tank, and the ceiling fan turning itself off.  Amenities: 4/5  The stuff you can do outside of planned activities is insane; plenty of bars including a swim up bar, a huge pool, a great (but rocky as hell) beach, and activities catered for all!  One point lost due to the absolutely ludicrous prices in the shop - especially for suncream!!  Entertainment:";5
We spent 8 days fully inclusive at this Wonderful resort Iberostar Cozumel from June14th to June 22nd. We went with our daughter ,son in law and 10 year old Grandaughter who live in Florida. They recommended it as they went there last year and loved it. We absolutely had the best holiday ever experienced and we have travelled World wide.  It was the best! Beautiful paradise. Flamingos, beautiful birds and tropical flowers and gardens . Peacocks roaming the gorgeous grounds. The choice of food was excellent.  Marvellous breakfast. lunch and dinner buffets. Also casual beach bars and food around beach and pool. Superb cocktails,lagers and wine.  Excellent service from all staff in restaurants and table service for drinks if preferred. 3 5 star (a-la- carte ) restaurants. Steak;5
Our day trip to Iberostar Cozumel was one for the books! We took a taxi from the Iberostar Tucan in Playa del Carmen to the ferry in Playa del Carmen. The cost $12 USD. The ferry cost for 2 round trip $56 USD. If you buy a round trip make sure to understand there are two ferry’s Winjet (orange) and Ultramar (yellow). The two ferry’s alternate. Make sure to know which ferry is leaving at which time.  Our arrival onto Cozumel was smooth. There are designated spot for taxis. We waited in line approximately 10 min. The cost of taxi from Ferry to Iberostar Cozumel was $30USD.   Once we arrived at the resort we signed in with a day pass. No cost. Just had to show our bracelets and driver license and sign our names to a document that we understood the rules and times allowed for our;5
I give it 5 stars because we had a wonderful experience. It has a friendly and casual vibe.  Angelo and Alejandra and the rest of the entertainment team were top notch! Fun games were played in the pool and the lobby. Don't  miss the Boogie Nights show! You can hang out at the pool all day or take a 15 minute taxi ride to downtown for shopping. Alberto's Glass Bottom Boat snorkeling tour was amazing. We will definitely  do that again.;5
Just returned from Cozumel where we booked a day pass for Iberostar. Gorgeous jungle setting leading up to the beautiful beach. Fantastic food, great pool and swim-up bar, and lots of fish for snorkeling. We plan to return for a longer stay.;5
I can't imagine a better resort situation.  3 - 6 rooms per building, short walk to a swim-up bar pool, food, entertainment, beach volleyball, and Dressel Divers right on the beach!  Outside of our room, we saw peacocks, small and large lizards, flamingos, macaws, and some local animals I've never seen before.  There is lush vegetation throughout.  Drinking water stations are scattered throughout the resort.  I really enjoyed my stay here!;5
My husband and I visited Iberostar for 8 days in June of 2022. We had a fantastic experience. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The wait staff was friendly and extremely attentive. The entertainment staff was AMAZING!! The nightly entertainment was fun & exciting, and we were very impressed with the staff’s professionalism and ability to keep everyone engaged and entertained. Big shout out to Alejandra, Edgar, Lenar & Angelo from the entertainment team, I don’t think our trip would’ve been as fun without them. We loved the daily aqua-aerobics classes offered in the pool- these were a daily must for us, especially given that this is an all-inclusive resort. The grounds, dining halls/restaurants and rooms were well maintained and clean. The resort offers;5
Great experience. We decided to come here to escape from the sargazo in Quintana Roo and it was a good decision. The resort is well maintained, the service and staff are great and rhe facilities always clean. The staff at the kids club were amazing and our 7 year old had lots of fun with them. The beach is really nice and amazing to snorkel, the rocks at the entrance are not a problem, bring water shoes and you will be fine.;5
Iberostar Cozumel is a fantastic resort in Cozumel. Great food, incredible staff, and close proximity to dive sites.  Gabriel, who helps bring in and out the catamarans and kayaks, was especially helpful.  Also, my wife and I got an upgraded room when we arrived free of charge!;5
Great resort. All the staff go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The entertainment staff is great at what they do. All the entertainment was very enjoyable. The grounds keeping is done constantly and very well maintained. Had no complaints with the room or house keeping.;5
This place was spectacular!! The views and beach were remarkable. The food wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t very good. Make sure to find what you like at the beginning of your stay and stick to that for the remainder. The star friends and staff are so friendly and the whole atmosphere is so welcoming. Lenar and Alejandra are the best star friends ever!!! And Salvador is the best excursion planner. The last thing to point out is how outstanding the snorkeling and scuba diving is!! I would definitely go back.;5
Trip was amazing, especially thanks to Lenar and Alejandra for making our trip awesome. Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting to have fun. Great community, lot of people from texas for some reason. Definitely try scuba diving;5
We visited Iberostar Cozumel for a week in June 2022.  We had been there several years ago and had a good experience.  This time around, it really seems like a lot about the resort has declined.  The rooms are extra musty, but that isn’t new and you are right on the water.  The majority of the hotel is open air🥵. 2 restaurants and the guest rooms are the only air conditioned spaces.  Most of the ceiling fans in the lobby and adjoining buffet restaurant were either not working, or not on.  It can get very hot. The ac in the room couldn’t keep up and it was very warm.  All the people in our party had the same issue in their rooms, and so, it wasn’t worth complaining as it seems all the rooms are the same.  The grounds are nice and the flamingos, peacocks, etc. add a nice touch.;3
Iberostar Cozumel ROCKS!!!! The staff is amazing, especially Angelo. He treated us like family!!!  The food was excellent. Entertainment was outstanding.   We will definitely be returning to Iberostar in the near future!!!;5
My family had an outstanding experience as always with great service from Manolo, Rogelio, Cindy, and Rosa. They have all gone out of their way to make connections with guests and offer great service to all.;5
Fantastic group of support staff Cindy, Manolo, Alejandro  We had a fantastic 7 day stay at the iberostar. This is our 4th trip to the resort and has become a yearly ritual now. Cindy is the best, she instantly recognized our group and provided the best breakfast and lunch experience pampering our needs.   Manolo our gym, yoga, Pilates expert has been helping me with stretching and my fitness goals. It’s awesome to be in his presence and learn from him.   Alejandro saw our group and pulled us in to play random games like Pictionary, karaoke etc and makes the lobby area fun and exciting  The only compliant I have about this place are the power outages. We experience atleast one if not two every year but we try to cruise through them.   This resort is truly paradise.;4
My husband and I were there for six nights and met amazing people there. Alejandra, in the entertainment team was amazing, a great attitude,  making everybody dance and participate in the activities in the pool. Cindy was another person in the restaurant as a waitress, she attended every need we had and was quick getting us what we needed. I was really impressed on how she not only was talking to us but everybody in the restaurant, she was full of life, your rarely see this type of service. We’ll definitely come back! I hope they get paid a fair wage. Good employees are hard to find.;5
Alejandra, Leonard, and Angelo made this stay feel like home in the best way, these employees were like friends by the end of the week! Every event was entertaining and all staff were amazing and polite.;5
Manolo the fitness instructor at Iberostar Cozumel, is very passionate about his job and helping others on their fitness journey. He is a wonderful motivator and encourages everyone to be active. His salsa class was amazing and we had a great time! This resort is lucky to have such an amazing instructor!;5
"The resort is beautiful with lots of wildlife present. The food was excellent and the entertainment is great.  Angelo, Leonar, and Edgar at the pool are fantastic with lots of fun activities available. P.S. Angelo is “so sexy”, his request for the review ;)";5
Angelo & Edgar& Leonard are great entertainers! Angelo's very funny & a good Aquafun trainer. He makes sure everyone's having fun & you'll get quite a WORKOUT I tell ya!!  Both Edgar & Angelo are great trainers.  Volleyball, archery, shooting, hockey, etc.. so many activities to choose from so make sure you stay for at least a week.  The star camp: Rosa, Karen, & Ismael are a great team too. Put your kids in the kid's club & go have a drink by the beach side or in the pool.. They keep your kids entertained with painting, tyes-dye t-shirts, beach volleyballs, kid's archery, & endless games. We put our older kid in there every single day. We enjoyed our stay @ Iberostar Cozumel & will be back next year!!;5
We had a fabulous 5 days at Iberostar.  The staff was over the top in terms of customer service.  They were very attentive, especially at the Star Camp Kids club including Rosa, Ishmael, and Karen.  They took care of the kids and made it so much fun with many activities...painting, water games, archery, ect. Kids need to be 4 to 12 yo but they will accommodate younger kids with parents.  If you have kids, I definitely recommended paying stop.;5
I just finished a Pilates class with Manolo and he is amazing! So kind, very knowledgeable and a fantastic teacher. I lucked out and was the only student this morning so I received some one on one instruction and he helped me correct my form. The setting is breath taking…I can’t imagine a better way to start the day than Pilates looking out at the Caribbean ocean. Please give Manolo’s class at the Iberostar on Cozumel a try-you will not be disappointed! It’s a perfect balance of a hard work out balanced with relaxing breath work and stretching:;5
Beautiful hotel & beach! Super friendly & talented staff! They work all day entertaining guests & then show their amazing talent at the evening shows! Wow! Way to go Edgar, Angelo, Alenjandra, Manila, Rosa.;5
The grounds and beach are beautiful. The staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, the food and drinks were good. The rooms were nice and clean. Some of the entertainment was good, some wasn’t. The resort is very laidback and relaxing. The staff all wore masks all the time, which for me is unnecessary. The water was a little murky in front of the resort, but still beautiful. The best snorkeling is a short boat or cab ride away. Sky Reef and Playa Corona both have good snorkeling from the shore and are only a 10 min. cab ride. They are free as long as you buy some food and drinks.;5
This resort is beautiful and I love how there are so many buildings as opposed to one large building with all the rooms in one area. It feels like you truly are in nature. The restaurants are really good, so make sure you make reservations! The staff really all went above and beyond and were all fabulous! The entertainment team is wonderful, especially Lenar, Alejandra, Angelo, Mary, Ismael and Karen. If you need help with dinner reservations Luis at the hospitality desk is a gem and Edgar at the pool bar is fantastic! Can't wait to go back. :);5
The grounds were well maintained and beautiful. It was like a jungle excursion. The  people at the dive shop and the entertainment crew were just amazing. Angelo and Alejandra were fantastic! They made the trip fun. We rented catamarans from the dive shop every day. We went on one diving trip as well. Our diving instructor was Lauren and she was amazing. We absolutely loved our diving experience. The rooms themselves were adequate but not impressive. The rooms had air conditioning but struggled to keep the room cool. We had three rooms rented for our family. My daughter’s room had some short in the electrical system and had zero power. They were forced to relocate her to a different room on the opposite side of the resort from the rest of the family. The pool chemicals turned my;3
"This was my first and last visit to this property. The property overall is not in the best of shape and poorly maintained. Ceiling fans were not working in the lobby, there were cats and birds in the restaurants and all the restaurants were very short handed. The staff were nice for the most part but tips were always expected and the service suffered especially at the bars.  The rooms - the rooms were sub par. The room we started in had missing sections of tile. I mean the whole tile floor was missing under both beds. It was bare concrete and had a smell to it. Please note this was an ""upgraded"" room. Thank goodness it was complimentary! We were moved to another room and it wasn't much better. The A/C unit had to be replaced while we were there. Also, we had to have our keys";3
We enjoyed our stay and met lots of great people! The staff was very welcoming and the entertainment was awesome. They have a very talented group of young entertainers that kept you busy with music shows, crafts, trivia and pool games. Kudos to Lenar, Alejandro and Angelo. Very beautiful people with great personalities. There is only a few things that I was disappointed in. The food I would give a 3 * because the food was bland, no coffee maker in the room and the room was very small compared to other all inclusive resorts that we have stayed at. The Scuba diving was great and you had to do lots of walking to get to the restaurants to eat at. We also had to have reservations at 3 of their main restaurants. I gave them 3 **** because of the friendliness of their staff! They could;4
We stayed at Iberostar as a family of four and enjoyed it. Got to see a lot of wildlife which was neat. Staff were friendly. Some of the servers were better than others. We were disappointed in the food and service at the Mexican restaurant there. Others were good. Just something to know…if you plan to use your coupons…Must have them with you!;4
This is our 5th visit to the resort. Overall it did not disappoint, the only reason for 4 not 5 stars is recurrent issues with our air conditioning. The last day of our trip trying to pack and get ready for travel I was sweating the entire morning. This made for a miserable end to our great trip and was worsened by a day of travel while already sweaty and drained. Otherwise we had a large group that met and stayed at the resort. The Steakhouse was fantastic, Oriental restaurant was pretty good, our friends booked the Mexican restaurant and said it was terrible, actually went to the buffet to eat immediately after. Thank goodness we skipped out on that one. The entertainment is amazing. They had a poolside fire show that wowed everyone! Angelo was an amazing entertainer and so;4
Great service, good food and awesome entertainment! This resort has bungalows that are spread out, it's like walking through the jungle to get to your room. The beach is nice and wide, swimming from shore is tough due to coral, but you can get in from the pier. Wear water shoes to walk in 200 yards to the south and drift snorkel to the pier. We saw starfish and stingrays everytime.. The staff are friendly, say hi to Cindy and Didier in the restaurant, some of our favorites.;5
Wonderful Experience!  Karen, Rosa, & Ismael we’re wonderful with the kids!  Great place!  Rooms were clean, food was ok, went snorkeling it was wonderful!  Chinese restaurant was good!  Alejandra and Angelo were wonderful entertainers! Would come back for sure!;5
The resort is beautiful! That’s the main plus. The food is not exceptional. Stick with the main buffet. The Mexican and steakhouse restaurants (reservations only) are not that great. I wouldn’t bother with them. In particular, the steaks were very poor cuts. All across the board the service is not acceptable. They don’t like to refill drinks, and when they do, they act put-out even when they are generously tipped. One evening we dined at the the buffet restaurant. Both of our drinks were empty for quite some time. When we finally got the waiter’s attention, we both asked for more iced tea, but the waiter only brought back one. There were not many diners at all as it was still pretty early, and it was fully staffed. Our waiter only had 2-3 tables with 4 or less at each one.;3
Great trip, facility, and fun.  Only issue is the sand flees on the beach between Iberostar and Albertos restaurant.  Otherwise no complaints at all.  Onsite dive operations Dressel Divers was also great.  Overall a great trip for the price.;5
I took morning yoga with Manolo while I was staying at Iberostar Cozumel. We were right on the beach, listening to the waves! I was super excited, and Manolo did not disappoint. His class was a nice combination of relaxing and challenging. I really appreciated how he said almost everything in English and Spanish! As someone who has forgotten most of the Spanish I previously learned, that was very impressive. He also works in the gym and teaches Zumba in the afternoon. He must be a busy man! I was so bummed I couldn’t join in Zumba, but I was leaving the day I took yoga. So glad I at least got to do yoga on the beach before leaving! Thank you Manolo!;5
Just love the Iberostar Cozumel! We stayed from May 31 to June7th 2019  for a family vacation and we did not regret it!   The open concept lobby is nice.  Grounds are beautiful and well maintained.  Close to the buffet and theater. Iberostar is recognized for their scenery and animal protection.  The gardens are beautiful and you can see different animal through the resort.    The little bungalows are a bit out of date and could use an upgrade.  The rooms are small but nice, clean and functional.  They could use an upgrade.  Don’t let this detail discourage you from going.  You only sleep in there anyway!  The mini bar is filled up everyday.   Food and drinks are very good.  You will find something you like for sure.  The buffet offers many different dishes every day.  At the;5
Breakfast and lunch server Cindy was the absolute BEST server ever! Our last day there was her day off and we definitely could see the difference. She was outstanding and we are so grateful we had her the other 5 days of our trip. Thank you Cindy!!;5
Wonderful holiday in the beautiful environment of a tropical jungle. Accomodation takes the form of brightly coloured circular huts with staw roofs and a private balcony. Excellent service. Humidity was a problem on our bathroom ceiling but it had rained heavily the first 3 days and the climate can be humid and heavy.  Diving with dressel divers was very enjoyable though it does run a bit like a factory. Special thanks to GEORGIA (Dressel Divers), with whom we made a day trip to Cenotte for cave diving. She was great company, knowledgeable, an excellent and patient instructor  If I weren't a diver, I would be disappointed with swimming in the ocean from the beach: rocks underfoot on the way in, quite a bit of seaweed, sandy water and very few fish. Thanks to MANOLO for his very;4
Excellent instruction with Manolo and he was very patient with helping me get back into yoga after surgery  I am looking forward to his dance classes  pjs you can catch him in the gym for help. Manolo is the best;5
Manolo is an amazing yoga instructor at the Iberostar Cozumel…yoga at the beach is very relaxing, meditative and healing.  You will also find him at the gym and is a personal trainer, Zumba and very helpful.;5
Absouletly fantastic!! This resort came highly recommended for its attention to details, the environment and having Dressel Divers on property. My husband and I got certified in January.  Each day we did a 2 tank  dive with Milly. Milly was exceptional!! She was always looking out for the divers to provide the best experience for everyone. The boat rides to our distinations were only 5 minutes. By the time we ce back from our mornings dives the houskeeping staff had already beem to our room and made our beds. Such a nice surprise each day.There were 3 speciality restaurants and a couple of buffets each day and the food was superb! Alejandra was the entertainment queen with Bingo, Corn Hole, and Pool aerobics,ect . Thanks for making our visit to Cozumel a special one and we will;5
My husband booked a last minute trip to scuba dive in Cozumel. We love Iberostar and Dressel Divers so Iberostar Cozumel was the obvious choice. Because it was a short trip the time to dive was limited to one morning (which was amazing, shout out to Santi!). The remainder of the trip was filled with constant run ins with Alejandra, a member of the entertainment crew. What an amazing young lady! She was engaging, personable, hilarious, and…of course…entertaining! Music trivia, bingo (sorry…Lotteria!!!), shooting rifles, and dancing in the pool, we had a fantastic and memorable trip!  Alejandra was able to wear many different hats in her role and filled each one seamlessly. We will continue to return to Iberostar resorts because of the outstanding team members like Alejandra and;5
Wverything was great, the games were great, and i got drunt asf . And games were fun. we were diving and the ocean it’s awesome ong the turtles are huge and the fish too. in alberto’s they have a pole and i really recommend the snapper . and i loved the entertainment team, alejandra wonderful.;5
Trough my visit at Iberostar Manolo was, for me, the greatest employee. He gave me tips with my training and gave one of the best customers service. When a meet him we were a the gym but he also gave us a great Zumba classes dans yoga class!  Mathieu;5
Loved our vacation here! The food is amazing and the views are incredible! Lots of great restaurants and buffet options. The entertainment staff is awesome—shoutout to Sofia and Angelo! Lots of activities and so much fun!;5
We really enjoy this resort but unfortunately this time it rained almost entire vaca. We had plenty of other fun options.     Really enjoyed the entertainment staff, especially Amber, Sofia,  Leonard, Daniel.;4
Very satisfied with the service. Special thanks to José Martin and his team.   The room, food, service was exceptionnel. I recommend Cozumel Iberostar to any famille out there. I will return to iberostar for my next trip !;5
This resort was perfect for our family would definitely go back in the future! The beach was amazing and the staff was perfect and welcoming. They felt like a second family and were super polite and helpful.;5
The service is wonderful and the grounds are kept beautifully clean. You’ll feel like you’re staying in a villa in the jungle with the hut style and bougie accommodations. Each room has an outdoor seating area with hammocks. The sounds of the several tropical birds chirping is perfect background noise for an outdoor nap. Seeing the random tropical birds and flamingos on the grounds was a beautiful and special touch.  GOOD FOOD: Aside from the good food in the main all inclusive dining room, there are also included delicious specialty restaurants. You DO have to make reservations for those specialty restaurants but do not have to pay extra. (Unless ballin out with a nice bottle of wine) house wine is included.   GOOD SERVICE: The wait staff is attentive and incredible. Fabian was;5
IBEROSTAR in Cozumel is a great place to stay! The staff is attentive and professional (especially Rosa, the towel girl).  The grounds are beautiful and the food is good, especially for an all inclusive resort.  They having a dive shop and lessons, great shows and other activities.  If you want to go someplace tropical and have a fun, relaxing vacation this is the place to come!;5
Even with much rain,my heart is full of sunshine! Indeed,I am feeling grateful  to have vacation here. From the waiters to entertainment teams for kids and adults as well, everyone and everything contributed to a warm, happy and filled of 'wonderfuls' family moments! A special shout to the show singers and dancers, who made us sing and dance together as one, Sofia and Angelo for their contagious happiness, Manolo my fellow Yogi and Lenar my newly found souls friends. May you all be blessed exponentially with endless success, happiness, health love and Light always @ICbyIlanit;5
Fantastic activities all day - i especially loved Manolo leading yoga, Zumba, and the fitness room! He was always so encouraging and a marvelous teacher! We also enjoyed the nightly entertainment which included an amazing cast of dancers, singers, and emcees. Special shout-out to Angelo and Alejandra, they were awesome! If you're looking for a family friendly destination that is full of entertainment and activity options, this is your place!;5
Loved the hotel. Scuba dives were great. Wonderful yoga session with Manolo. The entertainment people are amazing. Sophie, Alejandra and all. All you can eat is really all you can eat and drink!!!! Rooms are clean and comfortable. Varied restaurants;5
We really enjoy our stay at this eco responsible resort every thing was made in respect for the environment. We particularly enjoy having acces on the site to a verry good diving company (dressel diver). All the personal was happy and helpful. The service was great they pass by your chair at the beach to see if you need any drink, the resort was clean and the garden around the site is beautiful lot of animal here. Flamingo,parrots, frog, coati, agouti even wild pig . All the small house all around make you feel like you are part of a small village. The room are clean and have any thing you need except a coffee maker. This resort is calm and serene. The food is very good we enjoy all the restaurants they have verry good steak at the steak house and the cooking methods are;5
This was a great 15 day vacation. From checking in With the great hotel staff and porters, Yemi the concierge, the bartenders Geovani, Adrian, Eli, Cindy all of them were terrific — the cooks were spectacular, Fidel was superb, Cindy, Hector, Theresa,Judith and so many more helping us to our seats and serving us. The entertainment people Edgar,Angelo, Allahandra, Sofia, Lenar, these young adults entertained us all day long and into the evening.. they all have such talent….and the Star Camp people ..Ismael, Rosemary, Karen they were superb with all the kids of all ages… the singers were great also Amber & Daniell👍🎶.  Allahandra the dancer and May the choreographer.. all the massuesses in the spa have MAGIC HANDS..Manolo in the gym and yoga and dance lessons👍  Vladimir and;5
10/10 great resort with great entertainment Alejandra was a great host for games and entertainment who made everything exciting and fun. Would definitely recommend this resort if you want to relax drink listen to music and just enjoy a relaxing experience;5
Nice resort for a simple vacation. Location is perfect away from the hustle and bustle of the city, food choices was great, beach access was great. My only complaint was the power went out for about 5 seconds which triggered the AC unit so there was no AC in the rooms overnight for that day, it was humid and hot I don’t think anyone at the resort got test that night.;5
We spent our 20th anniversary here and absolutely loved it.  All of the staff was kind and helpful (even helping us with our Spanish).  Sofia and Alejandra were so fun with the games and entertainment.  The food was very good at the Asian restaurant and the buffet but we were less impressed with the steak house and Mexican restaurants.  Our room (8314)  was the suite overlooking the pool and ocean.  It was well worth the upgrade.  The grounds are super well maintained.  The SCUBA with the on-sight Dressel Divers was spectacular (thanks Hector and Ceci).  We worked out everyday at the gym and it was clean and had everything we needed.  We would definitely recommend Iberostar Cozumel and we hope to come back.;5
Wonderful resort. Kind and friendly staff, clean, clean, clean. Great food selection. Many activities offered. We now see why so many come back year after year. There are great tours and transportation options also.;5
This place was pretty amazing. The food was good, the alcohol was bountiful, but the biggest impact was the amazing entertainment. The team was full of energy every day all day and made my experience great for the second time. I came to this hotel last year around this time and recognized some faces from the previous trip as well as some new ones. Let me just say Angelo, Sofia, and Alejandra were some of the best entertainers I could ask for! I participated in almost every game so it would be hard to say exactly what games I loved with them, but volleyball and watching them in the show every night was such a blast. By the end of my short week there they all felt like family. Could not ask more from the entertainment team!;5
Sofia,  Lamar, Angelo and Alejandra  made this trip to Cozumel Iberostar Amazing!!!!They made this trip so wonderful .. I hope they are here when I come back they are friendly and delightful and hope to see them again 👍!!;5
"This resort is a tad on the older side and in need of some cosmetic repairs. When we got to the room the bathroom mirror was sitting atop the faucet (we called and it was fixed that day). The porch chair was broken, the mattress springs ""boinged"". The beach & pool cabanas have signs that say ""NO reserving cabanas"" but it is not enforced. By 7am there are towels on every cabana chair and most of them will not be occupied until well into the afternoon. This however I blame on the rudeness of the tourists and not the staff. The beach is so rocky getting into the ocean is almost impossible for anyone (especially the elderly). Masks are mandatory especially in the restaurants but is only enforced sparodically. Americans seem to be the ones resisting wearing one (go figure). The food";3
I LOVE ANGELO. The entire resort is super nice and very friendly no matter where you are. The burgers are kind of bad but it is super nice and welcomes anyone and is perfect for every kind of trip or vacation. The gym is amazing! Alejandra is very nice and brings fun times to every event.;4
The ambiance of the resort is awesome! The food at all of the inclusive buffets and restaurants are very good and my favorite part of the experience was definitely the large selection of activities and performances in the the theater and the lobby! We especially loved Alejandra, Angelo, and Daniel!!;5
"We have been coming to Iberostar Cozumel (couple 53 & 48 this year) at least twice a year for the last 8 years. It is about as far south as you can get on the west side and that is what we like... to get away from all the tourists. Does it have 5 star food? Well, that depends upon how hungry you are. The food is good, but the location and staff are excellent. We came here because it was close to the dive sites without a long boat ride. We kept coming back because of the people and the entertainment. I no longer dive, but we come to see ""the friends"" and the beach/water. We have stayed at 4 other places closer to town and we always return to Iberostar. The genuinely nice staff want to help you have a good time on your vacation. Angelo, Edgar and Ismael have really become our";5
We decided at the last minute to take a short vacation for our anniversary 4 nights 5 days. We were exhausted upon arrival and ended up falling asleep in our nice cold room for the rest of the day. The next day we went out on a deep sea fishing charter. When we arrived back to our room we found the room door wide open. I have no idea how long it had been open. Im guessing it was left open by housekeeping I have no idea. Nothing was missing and the front desk didn’t seem concerned when I called to notify them.   The beach/water as others have mentioned is very rocky. We wanted to snorkel but just ended up missing out as we only had a few days it was very windy with poor water visibility.   Now the food. They do have much more to choose from than another resort that  we have;2
We spent 5 nights here and overall this is a great resort.    The entertainment team led by Edgar was amazing.   Shout out to Alejandra, Lenar, Sophia and Angelo for having a great attitude and doing their very best to keep everyone involved !!!   The nightly entertainment was exceptional.   Food was on par for all inclusive.   Our favorite was the La Pagoda (Asian influence).     Room was good and the AC was awesome.  The beach is probably the only drawback as there are lots of rocks which makes getting in and out of the water difficult.    Again, the entertainment team offset any negatives as they were the star of the resort!!!!   Lots of wildlife throughout the resort which is fun to see as well.  Would regally like to give a 4.5 stars but had to give 4 for the beach.;4
We love this resort. We are here now, sadly we will leave tomorrow. The people make this resort amazing. The Star Friends, Sofia, Alejandra and Angelo and Edgar are so great!! Spent the whole week really enjoying them!! Ana is always so friendly and always serving cocktails with a smile! The people have become like familia. The property is absolutely stunning. I will be so sad to leave, but we will definitely be back for our third visit.;5
The entertainment team made our stay great. They has so many fun things to do and were all hilarious and good people. Specifically, Alexandra and Lenar made our days at the resort memorable. They both went out of their way to talk to us and learn more about our family.;4
We travelled all the way from the uk on an 11hour flight and it did not disappoint. The staff who Re at the resort are some of the best people I have ever met.  They are kind  fun, caring and yo wayyyy above and beyond to make sure everyone on their holidays have the nest time. So many daily activities and the shows are amazing. They have everything from the rock show which is the best noght packed with live band rock music, to boogie night, karaoke and so .uxh more. They also do bingo nights, and In the day , there are so many rleaxing activities, tote painting, dreamcatcher and bracelet making. Special shout outs to angelo (he is just gorgeous inside and out) alejandra and Sofia for being so beautiful, helpful and entertaining. Sofias growls were legendary! They were our;5
Rosa, Ismael and Karen made our vacation truly special.  Kids club / star camp and the family activities were awesome.  They made our girls Denver 7 & Arrow 4 feel special and always included. Our children ask to return to Ibostar for star camp .;5
The entertainment team is amazing they make you feel welcomed and are super friendly. The team makes sure everyone is included in all the activities and is comfortable and having fun. Alejandra is very friendly and makes everything super fun! Edgar is an amazing dancer and makes personal connections with all the guest. Angelo is the life of the party and is a super fun person. Sofia is very kind and is the best water aerobics instructor. Lenard is super sweet and makes the Iberostar experience even better for the guest.;5
Morning yoga with Manolo was such a peaceful way to start my morning! Manolo did a great job at leading a bilingual class. And the view and breeze of the ocean was perfect. I highly recommend this experience!;4
I had an amazing time staying at this resort. This was my second time to stay here. The food is great and the service at the bars and restaurant was excellent. The star friends, specifically Alejandra, were incredible and so entertaining. She did a great job putting on shows for us and doing different activities. I highly recommend staying here!;5
Alejandra was so amazing and made us feel right at home. Her and her star friends crew made the trip so much better. The buffet is great and the wildlife makes you feel like you’re in a jungle. 10/10 would recommend, and I can’t wait to come back!;5
Went to Yoga class with Manolo at iberostar in the morning. The class was super good, Relaxing and very good teacher. The view was super nice and felt great. I recommend his class as it was amazing. Thank you;5
"We spent wonderful 10 days at the Iberostar Cozumel resort.  We were welcomed promptly upon our arrival.  The property is beautiful.  Very well maintained.  Our room was well appointed with a stocked mini fridge (pop/beer), A/C, walk-in rain shower.   Coffeemaker in the room would have been nice, but with them trying to be environmentally friendly,  I could understand why there isn't one.  Maybe having a coffee station available at the ""Steakhouse"" location (as it is more centrally available than the lobby buffet restaurant) could be an option. I did appreciate the adjustable magnifying mirror (something I wish other hotel chains had).  Hubby loved the hammock on the balcony.  The food at the buffet restaurant was very good and there was something for everyone.  As for the";5
Just returned from a week long stay. Can you say fun?! The entire entertainment staff is on their game! Miss Sophia, Rosa, Alejandra, Karen, Angelo,Ismael and Lenar ( I apologize for those who’s names I forgot because every single one of them deserves to be recognized )  made my trip unforgettable! I highly recommend participating in the adult pool activities and poolside arts & crafts. Miss Sophia & Angelo gave me a fun workout with water aerobics, I made a bracelet and painted a tote bag. By participating in activities all of the entertainment staff got to know me and were calling me by my first name. I was impressed! I truly felt like I was home with all my new friends. I also became friends with Mr. Fabian, one of the head waiters who was very attentive to all our needs.;4
"I visited the resort on the week of the 16th of May with my family. The 8 of us had an amazing time. The entire entertainment team was super polite and hard working. Sofia, Alejandra, Angelo, Ambar and the rest of the team made our stay super fun with well prepared activities. There are high quality  music shows on the evenings; the musicians, singers and dancers blew our mind. Didn't expected to see such good quality show at the hotel.   The resort is very clean - special thanks to Alan who cleaned our room and each time was pristine.  Food was very good, and buffet has a lot of options - special shout out to Margarita  who was very kind in preparing special eggs every morning. Service at the restaurants and bars is also really good -  Wilvert and Adolfo where our regular";5
Alejandra and Sofia made our stay the best!!  They make the entertainment absolutely the best, fun and so entertaining. With the dive center right on site, made it so easy to dive in one of the the most beautiful parts of the world. I saw sea turtles, stingrays, and eels. Thank you Iberostar.;5
I had a really nice trip!! Entertainment team was really fun, great activistes!!! Special shout out to Alejandra, she was so great! And the rock show was literal fire, it was so great. The drinks were good and the food was delicious!!!!;5
We had a blast! The resort was beautiful and every single employee was top notch! The entertainment staff made every evening so much fun, especially Alejandra and Sofia. They had us in stitches every night! There were so many food options and we always found something we enjoyed. I loved having water stations around the property, too!;5
This review is specifically for the Oriental restaurant at this resort. They went out of their way to make my birthday memorable. The food was excellent and the main course, Salmon, prepared br Chef Jose was impeccably done. Our waiter, David, was very attentive. Omar the headwaiter made it all special by bringing me cake with a candle and they all sang Happy Birthday. Such a great experience. Thank you!;5
I visited with my husband the week of the 16th of May. I have to say the experience blew my expectations. The entire team was super polite, friendly, helpful and fun. Big shout out to the entertainment crew Sofia, Alejandra, Angelo, Lenar, Ismael and Rosa. All of them Made our stay super fun. I don’t have the names of the people who cleaned my room (6104) but I must say they did an excellent job, everyday the room was pristine.  The food was very good and the omelettes every morning were delicious!  I also took the Discovery Scuba experience, it was the best decision, thank you to instructors: Omar, Hector and to Acatzin who gave us the first intro in the pool.  Looking forward to my next visit!!;5
We traveled to Cozumel to celebrate some big milestones and chose Iberostar Cozumel because it was well priced, had good reviews and looked relaxing! We stayed in a Cancun resort last year and this was hands down a better experience. The resort is beautiful and feels like you’re in a rainforest. There is so much nature and wild life: flamingos, parrots, peacocks and coatis everywhere!  The food is some of the best we’ve had at an all inclusive resort, but you shouldn’t expect fine dining. The rooms are just what you need for resting after a long day in the sun, but nothing extravagant. The entertainment team makes sure there are fun events if you want to engage in something other than sunbathing and swimming. One of the many highlights of this trip is when the entire pool joined;5
First of all, Sofia from entertainment  was absolutely amazing and made our trip excellent. Reyes, Raymundo who were the bartenders went above and beyond serving us drinks and making us feel welcome. The wildlife was incredible around the hotel but we felt at home the entire time. These people were the sole reason we are going to come back again soon. I hope this resort appreciates all their collective efforts because they above and beyond the entire time. 10/10 by far this resort was beautiful and the events were so much fun. Can’t wait to come back for my next trip!!!;5
Came to this resort and had an absolute blast ! The beach and pool are amazing , the food was so so good , the entertainment staff Sophia specifically was amazing !!! She was so involved with everything had a smile and a fist bump each time we saw her ! Reyes and Reymundo are the best bar tenders I’ve ever had at a resort always had a drink ready before i even ordered it , i would def come back to this place;5
Love all the wildlife and tropical plantings in this place.  The food generally  good we particularly the tortilla soup at the Tex-Mex joint and most desserts were very good. Scuba diving was well run and friendly, but a bit over crowded at times.  Don't get a room too close to the dive shop unless you don't mind the late night music from the rowdy bar next door.  The only issue we had was from the vacationers.  Yes it's all inclusive, but if your wealthy enough to be there then you certainly can leave a few bucks regularly for all these hardworking underpaid nice folks they're just trying to earn a meager living!;4
Well...I went on reviews so let me give an accurate one- Good and bad. The good part- we are divers and Scuba Tony was able to pick us up at the dock in front of this resort. Dresses divers are cattle boats with way to many people for our comfort if you like smaller 6 person boats like us. This is our 6th time to Cozumel, stayed many places, this place we will not visit again. Flamingos and birds were nice, grounds are kept well. Pool is filthy. Black in tiles sides full of soap scum, sunscreen scum, some kinda scum. Eww. Food is average for all inclusive..no AC  anywhere but your room. And you cannot adjust it cooler. No coffeemakers no roomservice. Nice way to long walk at 6am to get a small cup and drink it in 90 degree weather. Bring a cup with you to fill!  Chinzy pool;2
We have stayed in at least 25-30 different all inclusive resorts in Mexico, and this one jumped to the top of the list almost immediately and we nearly cried when it was time to check out!      Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum are just overrun with seaweed for about 9 months of the year now and something made me wonder if Cozumel might be a better bet for beautiful, clear, swimmable water. The answer is yes! I started looking at west facing resorts south of town. I had never stayed at an Iberostar hotel before, but the little huts and jungle like grounds appealed, so I booked it and hoped for the best. Check in was fast and easy and NO TIMESHARE PEOPLE trying to give you a tour!!!!     We have already decided to go back in February. The landscaping is absolutely beautiful and;5
This resort is wonderful and was a perfect place for to spend vacation with my family. Wonderful pool, amazing beach and the staff is out of this world! We tried out the Star Club (for kids) when my kiddos wanted to do their Treasure Hunt and went back the next day to do a sand castle competition. Ismael, Karen and Rosa from the Star Club made the time for my kids so fun!! They LOVED it and had such a great time!!! Thank you to the whole staff!;5
"7th time here and have trip planned for  October 2022;  Will not belabor points well covered;  tropical junglesque, wildlife, rocky beach etc.  will add tips and kudos. Good food,  could have more greens,.  Deserts good.  Fruit very good,  all 3 melons represented  and pineapple good.  Better than at home.  Not very good about re-stocking fruit and the good ice cream if you dine later, after 8 : 30. For breakfast and dinner. If going to steakhouse, do not expect real good steaks.  Filet Mignon a better choice than ribeye, but the salmon and chicken skewers are very good.  Corn soup (corn cream) highly recommended.  Do not expect Ruth’s Chris quality, but it is a fun experience.  No extra charge for the usually great sunsets that can be seen at steak house dinner.   If you like";3
"My wife, my two adult daughters and I just returned from a fabulous four night stay at the Iberostar Cozumel and were quite impressed by everything. We came for our best friends' wedding; they had been here multiple times so we're worried we'd be underwhelmed but far from it. Best part was the people: Giovanni, making the best cocktails, Fidel the head waiter at the steakhouse, and Roberto the GM who took care of some minor issues we had with excellent customer service. Here's the pros & some tips: Pros: - The resort is beautiful, lots of natural wildlife, birds, coatis and great floral. Very laid back resort, not near other resorts which is nice for walking the beach in both directions. Plenty of shady loungers, although lots of people claim chairs, we never had a problem";5
The steak house has terrible steaks. Everything else was a blast and will sure be going back. The facilities are very nice and the drinks are perfect. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The wildlife was awesome.;4
Relaxing, beautiful, clean, friendly.. I loved this place the food and service were excellent .. nice place for family vacation.. we will definitely return. Rooms and grounds were clean and beautifully manicured.;5
Awesome experience.  Loved the service and all the entertainers.  Sofia, Alehandra, Angelo, and Edgar really involved the crowd and we had fun playing and getting to everyone.  The steak house was the best of the trip.  I am allergic to carrots and found them in all the restraunts.;5
We painted bags today... the entertainment and activities dept is so good. Varied fun things to do for all ages.  Group of girls, some divers, some gym girls. We have had a great vacation. Rooms are great, service excellent, restaraunts have a great variety for everyone;5
Selection of food really needs help. Got the impression that the hotel was short staffed. The steak restaurant was below par and service was poor even though reservations were always maxed out but really only about 40% occupied. Overall for the cost the Iberostar is a good place.;3
Absolutely wonderful experience from beginning to end!  The staff was friendly, helpful and worked their butts off!!!  The entertainment staff was excellent, Angelo was perfection! Fredy,  Giovanni and the other hard working bartenders are top notch! Exquisite, lush grounds give you a jungle theme, with exotic wild life through out! We cannot wait to go back!!!!;5
We had good time here. The food is really good but my best place was the Oriental a la carte restaurant. My best activities was with Manolo!!! He is the gym trainer, he gave us yoga class and zumba dance. I did 2 dive with Dresdell  and it was ok. The t’rock band show was a blast!!! Yes, I would come back at this resort!;5
Outstanding service and accommodations! Many thanks to Ismael, Rosa, Angelo, Lenar, Alejandra, and Manolo for making my stay Heaven in earth… can hardly wait to return!  The food was so good with many selections to choose from.;5
Manolo is great since he helps me with my Spanish. He also helps me with my form on bench press. I help him with his English a little bit but he is great to speak Spanish with. He is very nice as well.;5
Had a wonderful trip! The resort is clean. It’s nice that each room has it’s own personal entrance. All the staff was friendly and helpful. A special thank you to the entertainment team (Lenar, Angelo, Alejandra, Sofia and Edgar), they work very hard!! Strongly recommend this hotel if your planning on staying in Cozumel! :-);4
Just returned from a week in paradise at Iberostar! If you are looking for brand new sterile environment than this is not for you, but if you want tranquil beautiful jungle grounds with birds chirping everywhere and a welcoming feeling where the entertainment crew will know you by name by the end than this is your place!   Kids did Star Camp multiple days, and while they were the only kids there our week Ishmael, Rosa, and Karen made sure they had the most fun with different games and activities each day.   For adults the drinks were not watered down, usually quite quick at the bar and also servers walking around everywhere taking orders. The entertainment crew were amazing - please take Angelo’s water exercise class! Sophia was new but you would never know it, the kids cried to;5
"This is a beautiful and well-designed resort! The rooms are comfortable and clean and bright. The grounds and pools are lovely and expansive. And the staff is outstanding--extremely friendly, helpful, and efficient. The food is delicious and tremendously varied, and while I enjoy the flexibility of buffet style, I do wonder at the safety of it as two of the four of our party got very sick from (different) food they ate. A few other suggestions for improvement: let your guests have some control over the A/C in their rooms; add more palapas for shade, since--despite your signage--everyone claims their spots for the day by 7am every morning; love the steps from the dock into the ocean, but the dock itself is a tripping hazard and could use an upgrade so it's more even.";4
We are just finishing a wonderful week at the Iberostar Cozumel. The property was meticulously maintained. The staff is very attentive. Our room was extremely clean every day. The diving operation is first class. We participated in fun activities, enjoyed the pool and the beach. Note that you need water shoes to access the ocean from the beach front, otherwise you can use the stairs from the pier, due to the shore being rocky. Lots of fish congregate in the morning under the pier if you like to snorkel. The property was not totally full which allowed everybody to find chairs at the pool or at the beach. The covid test included in the reservation was an antigen test administered on site the day prior to departure, which was very practical.  For my strict gluten-free diet;5
Great location for scuba diving. Boat trips are short and breaks are back on the island between dives. However with that, it’s popular so larger trips and less one-on-one dive experience. Aside from that room was in good shape but could use some updating here and there. Every ice machine was broken, constantly had to go to the bar for ice and water. Alberto’s was extremely loud at night which made sitting on our porch unenjoyable then. No option for room service or take away food, so we just carried plates back and forth. Overall good trip just could use some changes like to-go options and better ice machines.;3
This was our second time here.  It is clean and the food is good.  The entertainment staff is wonderful.  Alejandra and Ishmael are especially friendly and helpful.  Edgar and Angelo are incredibly talented.  We traveled with two other couples and we all had a great time.;5
Manolo was amazing for me and my family. From sunset yoga to instructions in the gym he was helpful and smiling every day. Thank you Manolo, from the bottoms of our hearts. What a wonderful sunny vacation.;5
Food is hit-and-miss, but there's variety, and the tropical fruits are superb (papaya, mango, pineapple, honeydew -- what you get up north doesn't do them justice).  Grounds are beautiful and well-kept.  Cute units.  Flamingos are endlessly entertaining.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Centrally located for SCUBA diving sites but far from town.  Dive shop on site.  Not rowdy.  Loud AC.    People, don't get burned to a crisp under the tropical sun -- take it in small doses or cover up.  I've seen lots of scary fuchsia-colored people here.;4
Awesome resort! Had an amazing time as a young couple. All of the staff was very friendly and worked so hard to keep the resort clean. Was a quiet resort, but still had countless opportunities to get involved in activities. All of the entertainment team was amazing (especially in the shows) but Sofia, Alejandra, and Lenar were exceptional. They took the time to get to know you and were always saying hello! Mexican and Steakhouse was amazing, no issues getting reservations. Buffet dinner was also good. The snorkelling at the beach was decent, but more to see by taking an excursion to the various reefs. Overall, would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking for a fun vacation! Once again, thank you to the entertainment team for truly making our trip special.;5
Nice all inclusive resort. Food was good. Entire staff is so hard working  friendly, helpful and always taking care to ensure the happiness of the guests. The resort is clean and the grounds well maintained. We would definitely go back.;5
"Wonderful experience at a well-organized and run all-inclusive on Cozumel - highly recommended for everyone. The whole five-night stay worked out fabulously on all fronts: terrific set-up of a well-managed eco-friendly property with beautiful ""real"" nature all-around, clean and well-maintained facilities, high-quality and great variety of food, the well-designed room with its balcony and hammock was just perfect - I even saw fireflies in the evenings. Dressel Divers turned out to be a great experience: flexible, willing to adjust to individual needs, and professional, we had an especially great experience with the manager, Nazareno Ovando, as well as the snorkeling excursion lead, Matias Ovando, and the diving instructor, Héctor. Bravo to everybody at Iberostar Cozumel for";5
I think this resort is phenomenal, everyone and everything is very friendly. The shows that are performed are very entertaining and cool. Edgar, Angelo, Alejandra, Ismeal, Sofia, Karen, Rosa. I like the steak house restaurant because the food is great. I would 100% come back anytime!;5
Everything has been great. A large complex, with many things to do. A great place to recharge. In particular I’ve enjoyed the gym, where Manolo has proven a competent and excellent professional. If you go to the gym, look for him!;5
The people, customer service, and everything in general is just fantastic. The food is also very good, especially the burger shack lol. They have activities every day so you never get bored, and they are very fun. The shows are entertaining and funny. The entertainment team: Angelo, Lenar, Sofia, Alejandra, Edgar, Ishmael, Karen, Rosa, and Gabriel are amazing people and the star camp, which is run by them, is amazing for kids ages 4-12.;5
This place is amazing! This is our 4th time here, we love all the staff! They treat you as if you are part of their familia. Alejandra, is so much fun and such a beautiful friendly person. Sophia is such a wonderful person as well, she is amazing at engaging everyone! They have truly become our friends !  Iberostar is so lucky to have a staff that represents them in such a positive manner.  They will always be a part of our memories. We cannot wait to see them next year🇲🇽❤️.;5
Had an amazing time! Beautiful resort with the best amenities. The staff was exceptional. Freddy, Giovanni, and Anna made the best drinks, Lenar, Giovanni, and Alexandra were beyond creative leading us into volleyball, pool exercise, daily games, and even theatre. We made a new amazing group of friends. We will definitely be back! Thanks for the memorable stay my friends!;5
My husband and I are nearing the end of our second trip to Iberostar. We really enjoy coming here! The environment and vibe is more laid back which is exactly what we look for.   Drinks are good! Rimando and Geovanni at the poor bar are great! They have introduced me to new drinks and are very good.   Entertainment is fun! You are always invited to participate but never feel bad for just watching. Alejandra, Sonja, Angelo, and Leonard are fun! They remember us day to day and come around and chat and invite you to activities. They perform at night too and I love the night shows.   This time I did the free scuba trial with Antonio. He was very patient, kind, and answered my questions!   Our room is always so clean and they get us whatever we need.   The food is good. It’s not;5
Had a great time all the staff was wonderful.highly recommend. The resort is super easy to navigate. It’s a must to make the reservation to go to the steakhouse for dinner. Beef tips were the best I ever had.👍👍👍🇲🇽;5
Every thing about this place is wonderful! Angelo, Alexandra, Sofia is the sweetest, funnest ever! They make us feel like we are family! They are the reason why I want to come back every time! The waiters, bartenders, cleaning staff… absolutely superb!!!;5
The best time. The staff was super nice and always helpful. The entertainment was amazing.  Can't wait to come back. The food was amazing.  Looking forward to coming back again really soon. I love the pools and the quick access to food and drinks.;5
We were at the Iberostar Cozumel April 19-26, 2022.  We stayed in a  standard room.  We have no complaints whatsoever.  None! Room spottless, gorgeous tiled bathroom.  Excellent housekeeping.  Comfy bed.  Food at resort plentiful and delicious.  Buffet always looked after.  Cold foods ice cold, hot food hot!  Interesting selection of specialty items ie infused drinks, fancy little prepared salads etc.  Both buffet dining rooms are so elegant,  Open-air, comfy chairs, excellent staff.  Pools absolutely spotless,  Perfect temp.  Drinks at all bars delicious.  Beach is lovely but not really swimmable due to rocks.  Simply walk out on the dock to the steps on the left hand side and jump in and enjoy the warm sea!!  Entertainment great.  This is a jungle-like resort with beautiful;5
Just wow. We had a wonderful time here.  The diving, food, ambiance, and entertainment all exceeded our expectations.  If you come here you need to dive or snorkel, don’t miss breakfast or any other meal really, and make sure to do all of Alexandria’s activities like pool volleyball and water aerobics.  It was all so much fun!! I read in previous reviews about poor customer service but I dont see how that was possible at all.  I was very satisfied with the entire staff.  They are wonderful and will make your stay a pleasure!;5
We stayed for 7 days but we should have stayed for 10 days. What an amazing place to relax and be pampered! Everyone we met was so kind and helpful. We especially loved Sophia the entertainer and Alessandra the waitress. Also there are many poke stops to spin if you're worried about that!;5
To summarize our time at the Iberostar in Cozumel in one word would be “astounding”! The food, music, activities, friendly staff and, nightly entertainment made us wish we had booked for 10 days instead of only 7. The days have passed by so fast and we are already planning to return. A special thank you has to go out to Sofia with the entertainment staff for making our stay so memorable!;5
Our visit was amazing it was my 1st trip and my inlaws have been here numerous times. The whole facility is amazing and the food was pretty good with lots of variety everyday. Sophia was super pleasant and entertaining everytime we saw her we just adore her!;5
We came back one year later and it is great to see our friends that we made from the first trip. Entertainment Team is fantastic!  Sofie is new  to the star friends and she is great with the guest.  The bartenders at The Prestige Club  (Reyes, Glendy, Argley) have been Fantastic!  We love being The Club Members thank you to our concierges  Yuremi and Raul.;5
This was our second stay.  We were here in May of 2021 and had to return.  It’s small but friendly.  The food is exceptional!  One of the Star Friends, Sophia was great.  It was her first week and she went out of her way to make us enjoy our stay.  So far we’ve eaten at all 3 specialty restaurants and they are all delicious.   Japanese was our favorite.;5
"My fiance and I had not taken a vacation in 4 years and - wow - we are thrilled we stayed at the Iberostar. While the property is beautiful, the snorkeling is thrilling, and the food is delicious, the most beautiful piece of the experience was the staff. Coach Manolo - thank you for the amazing workout sessions and yoga classes (+ the Spanish lessons)! Lenar, we hope you keep loving your new ""office"" by the beach. Cesar from Alamo, thank you for the simplest rental car experience. And, last but far from least, Milton - thank you for the Scooby Doo! If you are lucky enough to come to the Iberostar, please take some time to meet these unsung heroes. They will make your trip - I promise.";5
We had an amazing time, it was an incredible trip. The ocean is great, the food is truly phenomenal. Glendy, Rubie, Alicia were the best waitresses, Armando the bartender and Sofia’s entertainment made our trip!!!! Armando and Glendy picked us up after work while we were walking toward a concert. The rooms were amazing, a very private feel!;5
It was my wife’s and I first time visiting Mexico and we couldn’t have picked a better resort! The entire entertainment staff was amazing (Edgar, Angelo, Sofia, Alejandra, and Lenar). Geovani at the pool bar slayed making our drinks and the food was phenomenal. You won’t be disappointed booking this resort. Such a beautiful place.;5
The resort and location are beautiful, but it’s the amazing staff that make this location great.  Sofia is so much fun and has been such a wonderful person to get to know !! We did archery with her, had a ridiculously fun time at the couples competition, almost won at bingo, in addition to the trivia, and games in the pool!   She is friendly and caring and just such a great asset for the resort!  She always has a smile and takes the time to see how you are doing.    I wish the resort had more dairy free/vegan options for breakfast and desserts but I understand how that can be difficult!  The food overall has been very good and well labeled for allergies.  🏖❤️;5
Super great personality and everywhere we looked she was there to help and entertain ! We sill be back for sure. This resort is the best I have seen. Gardens, wildlife,diving etc..  the food is fresh and tasty. Night shows and bar staff is five. Star plus;5
Sofia gave us awesome experience!  We had a great time learning how to do archery.  All of the staff is amazing.  Lots of good times at the swim up bar and diving is great. Thanks to everyone that that made our experience so good.  Will likely be back.;5
We've been on many all-inclusive vacations, so we weren't expecting too much.  Iberostar Cozumel is on a totally different level - the best vacation experience we've had!  I've stayed at other hotels in Cozumel but in the future, I will only stay at Iberostar Cozumel.  All staff were very friendly - always greeted us and asked if there was anything they could do.  The food was fantastic - a wide variety and very delicious.  Rooms were clean and quiet.  Grounds were well groomed.  There were so many activities that there was no desire for us to leave the compound.  The dive shop provided excellent service.  Evening entertainment was far above the usual.  Every evening different and of very good quality - we enjoyed every performance.  I want to point out two outstanding people -;5
I very much enjoyed this resort. The staff members are all friendly and attentive. The food quality and selections were amazing. The grounds are all perfectly manicured gardens. Everything is kept up very well and cleaned constantly. The pool areas are very clean with clear water. I especially enjoyed the entertainment. I was not even expecting entertainment so it was a very pleasant surprise. Lenar, Sofía, Alejandra, Edgar, Alexa, Daniel, Ambar and Angelo, they were all so much fun. Everyone in my group really enjoyed watching these young entertainers and participating in the activities.;5
Hands down the best vacation I’ve been on! The resort is beautiful, the food is amazing, and they have the ultimate staff! Sophia was our favorite, so personable, funny, and genuine. We did rent a scooter and went around the island(highly recommend, it’s beautiful), but they have so many options of things to do that there was no need to leave the resort if you didn’t want to. No matter where you were at you saw everyone enjoying themselves. I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else for vacation!;5
Uniquely designed bungalow-style suites. Located in south of the island. A lot of green spaces, with 2 big pools that are very closed to the ocean.   PROS: Great family friendly resort with a lot of well-organized activities for both adults and kids throughout the day.  Many exotic animals such as peacock, flamingo, iguana that you could see in the resort.  Super friendly and helpful staff, Angelo and Lenar from the entertainment team worked tirelessly to keep everyone entertained. José, the captain in charge of service at restaurant was always there to make sure that we were taken care, especially after the incident that our son had an allergy reaction due to food in the first night. He took extra step to speak to the kitchen personnel about the incident in order to prevent it;4
I am here now .  The resort check in was good.  My room was in a good location.   The Television did not turn on at all, and the commode did not flush, but I don't watch tv and the commode ... I figured out how to get around that issue, by just lifting the entire lid!  I'll tell them when I check out tomorrow.  The shower was nice,  I had good hot water, beds are firm,  that works for me, and the rooms are very clean.   There is no bottled water in the rooms, they provide large glass bottles you have to fill up at the water stations positioned throughout the resort, the maids will not do this for you.    The beach has been made larger by pulling said in and you can walk along the sand by the hotel to enjoy Albertos that has great food and live entertainment.   The hotel offers;3
I’m so excited to be typing this right now! This resort is amazing and even though it’s our first trip to Mexico, we picked the absolute perfect resort to come to. I can’t say enough good things about the grounds and entertainment staff. Angelo, Edgar, Alejandra, Lenar, and Sofia were awesome and really put forth a ton of effort so we enjoyed our time here. Will definitely be coming back in the future!;5
My husband and I came to this resort for our 12-year anniversary…we were surprised by the peace, quiet, and beauty of this jungle resort.  We try new all inclusive resorts through the Caribbean about 3 times per year. I never hang out in our hotel room on vacation, but this time at the end of the day, I laid in the hammock on our deck to read.  All you hear is wind pushing the bamboo and birds.  So peaceful.  The bungalows looked just ok in online pictures, but they are so comfortable, with the deck and hammock being a big plus.    Entertainment-there were really good shows at night in the theater and trivia in lobby.  There were very few games/activities in the pool however.  Food was good all over.    No coffee shop but espresso and cappuccino in lobby.  One shop at hotel with;5
"This resort was such a wonderful experience for the price! We upgraded to ""near the pool"" rooms and were able to get all of our group right close by each other by booking directly through Iberostar. The resort is small and very walkable but still has 3 a la carte restaurants (we got to all 3 in our week and they were all good!). On nights you don't have an a la carte, I recommend walking to Alberto's for a  paid meal!  They had everything we were looking for here: all inclusive, swim up bar, a beach that is useable, and good food. We had a smaller dive company come pick us up at the beach instead of using the big boats on resort but the divers who did use them sounded happy with their experience. The couple days the company couldn't pick us up at resort, the taxi was 260 pesos";5
We've been to Cozumel 3 times now and Iberostar was by far one of my favorite resorts we've stayed at! The resort was beautifully kept, the food was good, and the ENTERTAINMENT....AHHH-MAZING! I would go back just for the entertainment, specifically Angelo, he made all the entertainment so much fun along with Lenar!! Angelo got us to play cornhole on the beach, a ball pitching game in the pool, a couples challenge on stage, and Karaoke in front of the entire resort haha never would have done that but again, Angelo was soooo much fun and it was hard to tell him know! Lenar got us to play giant beer pong, he helped Angleo with the ball pitching game, he also helped with the couples challenge on stage, and of course he helped me pick a song for Karaoke! All of the staff there were;5
The little thatched roofs were so cute and everything is less than a ten minute walk on the property! The negative things: food was average (I find that typical for all inclusive) and you can’t really swim at their beach because of all the rocks. The positives: shows were fun, the staff are kind and funny, the animals (lemur kind of creature, peacocks, macaws, iguana, and flamingos), filtered drinking  water all over the property, and  the security guard takes guests names and taxi drivers info before exiting.;4
This was our first time coming to Cozumel and Iberostar. The facilities and amenities were very clean and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly and easy to approach. Alejandra and Sofia from the entertainment staff made the trip very memorable with their games and dancing. Definitely will be coming back again.  Only things that could have been better were buffet for choices (Mexican was best), and bar lines at pool and beach bar could be long.;5
Great hotel and great staff. Had a relaxing break with lots of diving and good food. Impressed with the restaurant team who made huge efforts to cater for our food allergies. The food and overall service was perfect.  Big thank you to Fabian & Rogelio in the restaurant, the amazing burgers at the pool bar and the morning yoga classes on the beach!!;5
Loved every second of my time!!! Alejandra was the best!!! The pool was amazing with every song that was played, along with the games and activities that they provided for us every second and always staying active on our trip.;5
the hotel was amazing, the food was so great delicious! the drinks are also fine and the pool nice. we spent a great time with family and friends. the activities are so funny specially Alejandra from the entertainment team and all the star camp, karen, Rosy and ismael. than you everyone!!;5
We had a great stay there.  Pros: - the village is truly beautiful with well kept gardens and free roaming animals. - the sea and beach are very nice, remember to bring beachshoes because it’s a little bit rocky. Very interesting for divers - wifi coverage is excellent throughout the entire place. - Cozumel island deserves a visit - one special mention to the entertainment team: Angelo, Edgar,Alexandra, Sofia, Lenar and the singers. They have a great attitude and the shows are very well produced, certainly well above average.  Cons: - food is good but not exceptional, don’t bother with à la carte restaurants. - the rooms are generally humid and suffer from a severe lack of ventilation in bathrooms, which in turn causes mold.;5
We enjoyed 1 week of fantastic weather, food, and entertainment. The beach has fine sand and plenty of lounge chairs, there are plenty of restaurants to choose from and the food is amazing. The staff are very professional, kind, and friendly and they remember everyone’s name…very nice touch. The entertainers are top notch, especially the very talented  Amber and Danny. Just to name a few, Juan Carlos was a terrific concierge and super helpful, Ismael, Lenar, Angelo, and Sexy Edgar kept us busy all day long with pool fun, rifle shooting, archery, and night time fun at the shows. The resort was very clean and the hut-style rooms are so private, and the grounds are beautifully maintained. Flamingoes and peacocks surround the open air restaurants. The staff never stopped working and;5
One of the most important things in a vacation stay is the STAFF.  A few years ago, we stayed at a gorgeous resort in Riviera Maya and STILL had an unpleasant experience that put us off Mexican all-inclusives (read my reviews for details).   We decided to give it another try at Iberstar Cozumel over spring break with our 2 teenagers. WOW. We had an amazing vacation here, and largely due to the welcoming and efficient staff. The bartenders served perfectly mixed cocktails with speed and a smile, no matter how slammed their bars were. The wait staff were professional and pleasant in their service. Every single staff member greeted us with a warm hello as they walked past. The entertainers were amazing! The games and shows were so well produced and performed. Angelo exudes the most;5
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Iberostar Cozumel. As two single women my daughter and I felt very safe. Hotel is very clean, staff is very respectful and friendly, grounds are gorgeous and well manicured, we found the food to be excellent with lots of choices offered. The only thing missing is a night club but the super friendly entertainment team Lenar, Angelo, Edgar and Alejandra more than made up for it. The Rock show was fantastic, great singing and music.  The only downside is the expensive store in the lobby. Try and grab souvenirs in the downtown if you can and bring all your own toiletries. Too expensive to purchase on site. Although we did not participate in diving, this resort is very popular with divers. Overall a great experience for some real R&R.  If you’re;5
4th time there - still dependably great, Foof was great, Staff superb. Even during a buey time, the resort did not feel crowded. Only possible advice woud be to eliminate the day pass visitors. They had a tendency to be less considerate than full time guests.;5
The resort is lovely.  The food and the options are great. The maids were always accessible and cleaned our room daily. The view of the ocean was amazing. The resort over all is clean. It's a great place for family or a romantic getaway;5
We've been here a number of times and aiways enjoy the lovely tropical island, long clean beaches and very nice local population.  The Iberostar resort has a good location with two story bungalow residences, no higher than palm trees and a nice long beach with clean warm water.  Very good for off shore snorkeling or you can go for a boat cruise to snorkel off a nearby coral reef.  There are also lots of scuba diving tours for those who wish.  We mostly had our meals at the all-inclusive buffet restaurant and went to the nice evening entertainment after dinners.  So all in all, a very pleasant all-inclusive beach resort and we would definitely go back;4
A group of 9 of us from ago 3-82 had a great time at the Iberostar. This was our second time here. The food was very good in the buffet and the lunch buffet. The service was very good. The dessert were delicious. Our room was always clean and the bed was comfortable. They could use some new pillows.  The pools were always clean and the water aerobics were good. The entertainment staff did a great job. Our great nephew loved the kids club.   The shows at night especially the rock show and horror show were very good. They always had singers or games in the lobby before the show. A nice touch. The grounds are absolutely beautiful with all the lush plants and the birds and animals rooming around.  We all had a great time and I am sure we will be back.;4
My wife and I write this review with some Iberostar Resort experience as this was our 3rd vacation at Iberostar Cozumel and our 6th stay in an Iberostar Resort. We stayed at Iberostar Cozumel twice in 2019 and now again in 2022. We could not believe the changes over 2 years, not many of them positive (Please review our other reviews as they may also be helpful in your decision to stay at the Iberostar Cozumel).  We fully realize that the Covid pandemic that hit the world in March 2020 has devastated the tourism industry and some differences in operation are understandable, even expected. However, that does not excuse the significant short falls experienced during our early April stay with the resort appearing to be at close to full capacity.  The Good/The Bad & the Ugly  First;3
I was staying with my sister and cousins and we very much enjoyed our holiday.nice beach access with pier.  With the option to book a la cart restaurants and buffet you have a variety of choices to eat,especially enjoyed the attentive service of chef José and captain Fidel! Also amazing animators like Alejanda who cheered us up everytime we saw her!small but great gym which is in good hands of Manolo,very much enjoyed his expertise!  The hotel is very quiet but also bit far from center.;4
I have stayed here multiple times over the years, and my stay in March 2022 may have been the best:  the staff was excellent as always, the grounds lovely and very well kept, the food variety and flavors were really good (something for everyone, IMHO.)  The nightclub shows (rock and roll, horror show) were quite impressive for the singing/dancing/gymnastics and efforts put forth.  The resort also shows a commendable desire to reduce plastic bottle usage, etc, in an appropriate way.  Their free Covid testing system was much appreciated. I come here because the resort is close to the dive reefs but note that it is pretty far from the town, which should definitely be visited.  Room for improvement:  the shower soap/shampoo were pretty much unable to create a lather, and some of the;5
Honestly one of the most relaxing resorts anyone could ever ask for!! I loved this resort for so many reasons so I will break it down for you: 1) The resort was absolutely GORGEOUS. The nature, animal sounds, beach waves, wild life, and the character just made me feel so calm and comfortable. 2) Since the resort is really spread out, we got to explore different areas and came across so many different animals and places for photo ops! 3) THE ENTERTAINMENT TEAM- they made my boyfriend and I feel so welcomed and at home. They remembered our names and always made sure we were having a good time. Oh yes, and ANGELO, he is the sweetest most vibrant personality. He always had a smile on his face and made us feel so comfortable. Give him a raise!!! :) Overall, definitely would go back.;5
This is my second time here. The staff is great Luis, Ismael, Karen and Rosa at the Star Camp. The entertainment crew is awesome.  Angelo, Alejandra, Lenar and Edgar are really fun to watch. I love how they keep the place clean. I love all the beautiful nature's animals around the resort. Thank you from my family and me Alexanader Rambo.;5
Resort was nice. Food was ok. Came in on a Thursday they would only let us book  sit down dinner for 2 days, said to come back on Sunday for the 3rd sit down but came back Sunday and they had nothing available for a party of 2 or 4. Entertainment and activities staff (Lenar, Angelo, Alexahandra , and Edgar) were great but no activity after 10:45. No music, no night club. Bar in lobby (Bartenders and waitress were great) was open to 1. No music by pool except when we paid staff to use the speaker, which was only available twice for less then an hour on 2 days.;3
I wanted a vacation where my son could get a PADI open water diving certification.  Iberostar Cozumel was an option thru the PADI site and we couldn't have been more delighted with the stay.  The dive shop was top shelf and thus lots of divers at the resort which in my humble opinion sets the bar for polite considerate guests...early to bed, early to dive.   The rooms are in magical looking huts minutes from the beach and my wife was totally comfortable reading and swimming while we dove.  The food was quite delicious,fresh and plentiful.  And the staff...God bless them for having to wear masks 24/7 in the heat, were as polite and attentive as you could hope for.   I can't think of anything negative.  Did we luck out?  Maybe, but I'll take it and we are looking forward to a;5
Cozumel and Iberostar Resort - an incredible experience! Thank you A Way To Go Travel, and MY agent, Carmela Beth Butner.   Cozumel a diver’s paradise, add the resort, Iberostar was perfect for an early spring vacation, but this resort accommodates all - families, couples, a friend’s getaway, and yes, those who travel solo.  The Iberostar resort is located on the south end of the island. It’s tucked away in Caribbean forest and opens up to gorgeous turquoise water and beautiful white sand. It’s away from it all, secluded for a perfect relaxing, laid back vacation.  The villas have 4-8 apartments in each, not the stacked hotel like buildings. Landscape is that of a tropical jungle with the most beautiful landscape. Tall trees, beautiful flowers, pristine gardens surrounding these;5
It's our first day back home after a week at Iberostar Cozumel, and my body and soul are already going through withdrawals! Not just from the steady cocktail consumption that occurred (though it's 5 o'clock, and I am finding myself craving another margarita from hard-working Raymundo and Agustin at the pool bar!), but also from the tasty food, warm water, sweet smiles and kindness of staff, and beautiful sunsets!  Based on my only other experience at an all-inclusive (in Riviera Maya, ~12 years ago), I went into this with low expectations - and my time at Iberostar Cozumel FAR exceeded them in every regard. Some highlights:  -The entertainment team of Edgar, Angelo, Lenar, Alejandra was top notch.  I truly left feeling like they all had become friends, especially Lenar and;4
"I've been to a few all inclusive resorts but this one has it all. If you've done your research you will already know the atmosphere is jungle- y...loads of wandering tropical birds (parrots, flamingos, peacocks) and stunning landscaping with lush tropical trees and flowers. But the Best part? Hands down: the bungalows! No elevators or long corridors smelling like cleaning products. The bungalows are charming and cozy.   Next, the food, of course. I chose this resort based primarily on the excellent food ratings. You will not be disappointed.  The buffets are ridiculously good. Everything from comfort food ( pasta, roasts, fried fare) to "" made to order""mexican cuisine and high end cheeses and meats and salads. I would compare it to any higher quality American Sunday brunch...3 X";5
This was our 7th time to Mexico, and the Iberostar Cozumel is well below the standards of any other Mexican resort we've stayed at.  Here are some issues: 1.   food is well below average, especially in the Mexican and Steak a la carte restaurants - food was burned and steaks full of gristle 2.  the rooms are well below average, and very very basic 3.  the beach is rocky - you can definitely not swim in it 4.  room key not working in the door lock: went to the front desk numerous times, after two days they had to replace the total door lock unit 5.  property not maintained: door lock issue that we had - many others also had issue, fans throughout the property do not work, watch out for Mexican racoons 6.  used toilet paper cannot be disposed of in toilet - must be thrown in;3
Everything was great at this Iberostar property.  The individual bungalows are a unique touch that makes it really fun.  The staff there really make the stay special.  Angelo, Alejandra, and Edgar made our stay the best!  Thru out the day they always had fun activities for us to do.  At night the shows and trivia and bingo led by the same three all-stars made sure we always had something to do.  Raymundo and Augstin at the pool bar had good recommendations for drinks to keep it fresh.  It is just a matter of time before we make a return visit!;5
The staff were the best I have ever had the pleasure to interact with. Two of my waiters we're Alfonso and Milton. They were very professional and took care of us with. The Head waiter was Fidell who handled our special requests with ease. Three picky women and old goat like me , and they handled it like pros. Can't say enough great things about the staff and accomodations. Would and will, definitely stay here again.;5
We spent 11 days at Iberostar. The food is good. You have a big buffet and I could order glutenfree. Fidel is a perfect host. He is very friendly and very attentive and even know our names. The divespots are beautiful. We had a great time there.;4
The staff at the star kids club are fantastic. Rosa, Ismael and Karen kept my 5 year old son busy with fun crafts. Beautiful grounds and lots of wildlife. Good range of food to choose from with lots of vegetable options.;5
One of  the nicer resorts on Cozumel. I have been coming to Cozumel for many years and have tried numerous resorts/hotels. We are middle-aged scuba divers, and this resort worked very well for us. Pros: The grounds are beautiful. Lovely beach, lots of vegetation, flamingos and peacocks. Very well-kept, and clean. We really loved the layout of the resort. The staff is great! Friendly, helpful, and very professional. Everyone works so hard. We thought the food was good, for an all inclusive. For divers it worked out very nicely. We could do two dives in the morning, get dropped off, have a quick lunch, and the boat would pick us up for afternoon dives. In addition to the main restaurants and buffet, there is a grill outside near the beach/pool. Great to get a burger etc. without;5
Angelo is great!  Amazing body! Wow! Love you!  Alejandra is fantastic. Also Lenar amazing.  Thank you for making this trip the best.  Water aerobics and activities were the best!  Oh and there are hotel kitties.  So cute!;5
Angelo was fantastic!  Amazing body!  WOW. Not to mention his entertaining poolside and in the theater are top notch.   Alejandra absolutely adorable, friendly, and so much energy.  She knows how to reach and rally the crowd.  Lenar, this young man will go far. Entertaining is spectacular but his personal touch to guests with casual conversation makes us all feel special. A kind and genuine human. Look out world!;5
Angelo was fantastic!  Amazing body!  Wow!  Alejandra, the beauty of the team, and Lenar were super great too!  Had fun any time the entertainment crew came around.  The morning aqua aerobics got us started every day in the pool.  Very enjoyable time!;5
This resort is family friendly, but definitely not over-ran by children.  The food decent, standard resort food.  The resort is amazingly clean!! The entertainment team was full of energy....especially Angelo!!  Angelo was full of talent and energy,  and worked the crowd good!;5
Our family has travelled to Cozumel many times. We are divers with young children and love the flexibility and diversity of activities this resort provides! There is truly something for everyone! While the kids didn’t attend Star Camp, they still enjoyed the activities by the beach with Rosa, Karen and Ismael. Daily 4:00 dancing by the pool with Alejandra was beyond exhilarating and the perfect 2nd wind for all of us!! The food is fabulous and easily accessible. The rooms are clean and comfortable, but not at all fancy.  Of course, the beautiful reefs will bring us back to Cozumel, but no doubt the kids will ask to come back to Iberostar!;5
Had a great stay! Came with 3 friends and had a blast. The resort was mostly middle aged to elderly couples but there were a few younger people, definitively not a spring break resort though. The highlight was definitively Reyes and the pool bar. Highly recommend staying here. And if you do, tip Reyes well!;5
"The zumba with angelo was awesome. The night time entertainment was also great, thanks to Alejandra, Lenar, edgar and Angelo. There was always something to do around the resort to keep us busy. The grounds are beautifully kept. The food was great. The drinks are ""ok"". The rooms need a bit of attention, but i would all in all still recommend this resort and would stay here again. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, they bend over backwards for guests.";5
Such an amazing group of camp counselors! They have kept my kids engaged with painting bags, jewelry making, making masks, games and so much more. Rosa, Karen, and Ibereal have been truly amazing. They have such incredible energy and are so welcoming!;5
What a great time at this resort!!  Everyone was excellent and very accommodating from check in to check out.  They took great care of our group of 5 adults and 5 teens.  The food and drinks were great as always.  We especially enjoyed our night in the steak house and Mexican night on the buffet.  We felt like food was even better than on our previous visits.  I wish I could remember everyone's names to list them separately.  The Star Friends team (Angleo, Lenar, and Alejandra) worked great together.  We enjoyed the shows, the pool games, and the other activities with them.  Finally, we had a great experience diving with Dressel right there on sight.  The only things I'd like to see improved is coffee easily available earlier (preferably near the beach) and guacamole back at the;5
there is nothing special about this hotel. i had been there before and this time i went for diving. there was no fire show or pool suds party.  the food was ok although  repetitive. the property is nice.  it would be nice if the top floor room numbers were on the bottom of the stairs rather than having to walk half way up the stairs just to find your going to the wrong room.  the biggest issue i have is that they have gone away from plastic bottles and have gone to glass. i grew up in the sixties and seventies and remember when people cut their feet on broken glass. i saw glass chards beside the path in the grass. be careful when walking in the glass. i put one of the glass water containers in the side of the bar fridge and when i opened the fridge it fell and smashed all over;3
This was my 6th trip to this resort. My husband and I finally agreed to bring our young adult children. They loved it just as much as we did. The food was awesome but what was even better was the staff. They were always right there to help with everything. The entertainment staff was great. Edgar is always so fun to watch. You can always see the joy that dancing brings him. We did miss Angelo this trip (he was off for the week) but were told we will see him again in October. I hope so because he always adds that extra flare to our trip. My daughter and I enjoyed craft time on the beach with Rosa. Winning bingo balls every night was always fun with Alejandra. Iberostar in Cozumel is my favorite place. The size, the staff and the accommodations are absolutely AMAZING!;5
"Especially Angelo, from the entertainment team, made a great effort to be super personal and engaging all week long. From around the resort during ""aquagym"" to before any evening show.  Dressel Divers did a great job of running the dives even though 2 days were canceled due to the harbor being closed (too windy and not their fault). Omar, Anna, Eva, and Diego were GREAT dive leaders.  Food was plentiful and delicious regardless of eating at the main buffet or the Oriental or Steakhouse restrauant.";5
Congratulations to the Iberostar Cozumel for having all the cats TNR'ed.  That's Trap Neuter Release for those not in the loop for feral cats. Left ear docked is the universal sign that this has been done.  Though I loved everything about the Iberostar, I was most impressed by the cat that came to my room (for the ham I took from the buffet),  that had his left ear docked.  Thank-you to whoever has taken the initiative to do this!;5
"Each year our group of couples make our way down to Iberostar Cozumel for so many reasons.  The beauty of the resort, comfortable & clean rooms and common areas, the wildlife, wonderfully presented, tasteful food, desserts & bars available all hours and locations around the resort; the gorgeous beach, pool and plentiful lounge chairs throughout the resort for relaxation; the list could go on and on; they do it right, thoughtfully and consistently every year.    A wonderful group of talented staff provide a variety of entertainment events throughout the day and each evening; their most precious treasure in this group is ANGELO.. We seek him out each year to say our hellos & enjoy his smile, laughter, personality and ability to make you feel so happy is beyond anyone we have ever";5
We just finished an 8 day stay at the Iberostar Cozumel.  It is the southernmost resort on the island.  We chose the resort because of the tropical setting, unique huts and snorkeling off of the beach.  The setting was amazing.   The  landscaping and walkways were spread out and filled with tropical plants and flowers. There were several animals (flamingos, Mexican raccoon, peacocks, iguanas) that kept visitors entertained.  The buffet restaurants and steakhouse were outside with open air seating under thatched roofs.  The property is spread out which was perfect for walking each morning.    The rooms were small but comfortable.  There was a musty smell and because of the high humidity, and it always felt like things were damp.  The beds were relatively comfortable.  There is a;4
"Despite the 5 stars on the entrance sign, this is a 3 star hotel.   First, if you are going there for diving, their onsite company Dressel Divers, is ok not great. Divemasters are friendly but the boats are overcrowded and chaotic.   Hotel: Positives: the food was great (esp impressive for all-inclusive buffet), good shows, relatively good service given the number of people.   Downsides: The biggest one: the hotel did “maintenance” from 11-4 one day where they cut power and water with minimal warning (yes - toilets were a disaster); EVERYONE wants a tip all the time, poor attention to details (Eg no tea at breakfast, ice machine frequently out of our ice)  It’s a big resort that manages high throughput - so just be aware of that.";3
Once you come here, you won't want to leave or go to another resort again. The service is absolutely wonderful from all the staff. Great food, drinks and diving at this location. This is our second year here and Angelo, one of the star friends is our absolute favorite! We were hoping to see him again as he makes the stay entertaining and memorable. He remembered us from the previous year, which is remarkable considering the amount of guests that come in and out of the resort.;5
If you dive or if you want a laid back pleasant vacation and if you want a friendly atmosphere, then come here. And Angelo - he’s awesome. He’s part of the entertainment team who are All Wonderful but he remembers everyone’s name and is friendly, kind and funnier than funny.     If you dive and want to stay at a resort that offers everything,  you can do it without leaving the property.;5
Wonderful dove operation on site, the food is wonderful and the staff is the best I've had at a resort. Was so excited Angelo (part of the great entertainment team) was still here, he has been a highlight and constant smile for 2 years coming to the iberostar.;5
Wonderful anniversary trip. What a great resort! We loved the beautiful gardens, the colorful thatched roof buildings and the amazing food. We came for the diving center and had a great experience. The spa was lovely as was the fitness center. Manolo did a great job with the fun Zumba classes on the beach. Highly recommend for people with families as well as travelers who like an authentic experience. This is a gem of a place.;5
Beautiful resort! Lenar has been so gracious during our stay. His sense of humor and caring personality has made the stay both relaxing and one that will be remembered! He is truly genuine. The grounds at the resort are breathtaking, will return.;5
"The venue is beautiful, beaches, food, staff, Entertainment love it all!   Love the evening entertainment; talented,  sexy and , picante Angelo.  Love his Michael Jackson Thriller and Zoomba in the pool. He makes us laugh.  Antonio was very attentive and calm in Scuba Training.  Buffet was so good. Loved the Fresh fruit.  Steak house rib eye tasty and juicy.  Massage was incredible too.";5
Quaint lil resort village.  Quiet yet felt comfortable getting just a lil rowdy.  Slept like a baby.  Food was good and selection varied.  Employees are very friendly and accommodating.  Beautiful setting.  Evening shows in theater were entertaining.  Very clean.  Wonderful place for people with any age of children or none at all.  Was not too crowded and always had chairs at the pool or beach.  I would return to this resort.;4
This was our fourth year in a row to this resort! Every year the stay gets a little longer! The staff remembered us and greeted us like old friends.  Angelo, Edgar, Leonard and Alejandra always engage and make you feel so welcomed. They work so hard preforming such entertaining shows every evening!  Ana who serves at the pool and the beach is amazing, we love her so much!! This resort is beautiful, I love all the plants, birds and butterflies.  We will see you again next year Iberostar!;5
"First things first: The staff at this resort are really absolutely amazing, and make all the difference here. I really wish I could name everyone who made our week special, from the restaurant staff, to the bartenders, to the excellent housekeeping, and the lovely bell services gentleman who helped me out several times. But I will name who I can – Isidro at the pool bar who remembered my drinks and kept my glass full; and especially Lenar, Angelo and Alejandra who ran the activities – everything from pool games, to salsa lessons, to the “shooting range” and all the personal, friendly attention. Those three are the hardest working, most cheerful and upbeat folks I have ever met. And I can’t believe how they get to know us all personally and remember names and details! We loved";4
Presentation is the strong suit here.  Beautiful resort on a beautiful site.  Multiple thatched roof buildings set in a well maintained 'jungle' landscape on a great beach right off some of the world's best dive sites.  The staff is professional and works diligently to provide great service.    Positives include:  Clean! , AC works well, beautiful food with large selection of choices, nice pool - bars - grill - beach lounge chairs - activities and entertainment.   Only minor negatives: I could not find a working ice-machine on the grounds, beds are hard and pillows are too small.;4
We have loved this place and been coming here for 10 years, this time being our 4th time. It has a great exotic feel. They seem to have made some changes or are short staffed or something because your hot spots like the bars, especially the pool bar and beach bar, had only one employee and would take forever to get a drink and the drinks were terrible, whereas previous years they were good. The restaurant in the morning to eat breakfast was a terrible layout because you had one person on each side to cook eggs and get your food off the buffet (due to covid restrictions they get it for you). This always caused a line of people waiting even if they only wanted food off the buffet. The Lunch and Dinner buffet was a smoother service. These are simple fixes but, in my opinion, would;3
We stayed one week End of March in this Hotel - travelling  the 4th time to Mexico, this hotel was definitely one of the best. Beautiful and vey well maintained environment, respecting nature and animals. The rooms were ok, little bit old fashioned but very clean. A big thank you to Lenar and Angelo, their motivation and huge talent was a big plus and made us feel at home. If I should mention a negative point it is the Steakhouse were the Sirloin steak was tough (quasi uneatable), French fries were served cold - service was not good neither: long wait time and no drink service during the meal. All in all I would highly recommend this place and we certainly will come back;5
Always a fun vacation!  Star Camp for the kids was wonderful with fun arts and crafts and games!   We were disappointed that the paint your own pottery stand wasn’t open while we were there by Star Camp made up for the crafty souvenirs.  Thank you Karen, Ismael, & Rosa 🎨!  If you want to have a consistent flow of entertainment options (Manolo 💃🏻, Angelo 🤸🏻‍♂️, Lenar 🥇, Gabriel 🏊🏻‍♀️) , diving on-site (shout out to my Shrimp Basket Diana 🤿), a beautiful beach with palms trees intertwined, a fun pool, and a friendly crew (Fabian 🤵🏻) then this is the place for you!;5
Rosa, Karen and Ismael were in charge of kids club at star camp. They were amazing. Lots of great activities. Our two boys loved every time. Can't recommend enough. The rest of the resort was amazing. Lovely food. Amazing staff. Really friendly and great value for money.;5
Amazing trip as usual, never disappointed! Even post pandemic, this place never fails to please. We were so happy with all the amenities, food, entertainment, seclusion and landscape (nature and wildlife). The Star friends (Iberostar entertainers) are truly amazing talent and a pleasure to be around ( Angelo, Lenar, Alejandra, Rosa, and the rest) Thank you for the great hospitality and entertainment StarFriends! The family was very pleased and we plan on coming back soon!!;5
Everything was amazing. The food is great, that activities are fun and awesome. Angelo, Lenar, and Edgar do a fantastic job with the activities. The shows are amazing and fun the 70’s shows and the rock show are the best ones. The lights in the shows were also amazing and they did a great job;5
"We stayed for a week--husband part of a 20 person dive group, wife a non-diver. We have stayed here several times before, and were not disappointed.  Check in and restaurant reservations (3 for a week stay) and booking our covid test all were fast and easy.  Our room on the 2nd floor of a building was clean, comfortable and convenient.  Pool area was ok, get there early to reserve a chair.  Bar service usually pretty quick. Restaurants were good/what you would expect at an all-inclusive.  Gym was good--shout out to Manolo.  Aqua gym class daily also good-Lenar and Angelo very fun and friendly and the workouts were pretty good.  Evening shows were good, very good music, singing and dancing and even an aerialist, minus the Karaoke night and ""The Perfect Couple"" shows which were";4
This is the place. The park-like pathways, abundant foliage, colorful birds and reptiles, fluttering butterflies, ample beach and pool seating, (WITH SHADE!!) made this exactly what we hoped our vacation would be. If you are looking for loud music, lots of drunken and obnoxious people, this is not the place for you. The staff was kind and professional, but not in our face. The food was quite good for an all-inclusive, especially the Mexican Restaurant. The bungalow room was small but clean and appealing and we loved the little hammock and chairs on the porch. The beds were very comfortable.;5
As people describe here, the resort its beautiful and the food is good. Beautiful well manicured grounds with friendly animals throughout.     A couple of things they could do better: 1. Kind of a low energy sleepy resort: The resort is very family friendly and it seems like it caters more to the senior crowd. There is no music by the pools. Not much of entertainment in the night other than their shows. Don't expect to be dancing late in the night.  2. The buffet is their star on their food, especially the breakfast. The main restaurants are not that wonderful. Among the restaurants the mexican is the best. You get better steak in the US.  3. Getting to the city is like $25 taxi ride. If you plan to go into the city, plan for that.;4
Our family stayed here and were very disappointed. I had booked  for 2 adults and 2 children and when we checked in we were told that our children (ages 13 & 15) were too old to be considered children so they made us pay for 4 adults. The rooms are nice and the beds are very comfortable. Try getting a room away from the water sports, as you will hear the loud clanking of O2 tanks being loaded every morning.   The food was so-so, the steak restaurant is the best one. Make sure to book a dinner reservation early as they fill up quickly and space is very limited. We made all of our reservations for the entire trip on the day we checked in and are glad we did because we tried changing restaurants one day and were told they were booked 3 days out.   Big annoyance: this is our 5th;2
The resort was very nice and well cared for. The staff was helpful and friendly. I was very impressed with the care they are taking to preserve the environment . No straws or single use plastic anywhere  they provide all things, such as soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in refillable wall mounted containers, so no plastic there either .  The buffet as well as the specialty restaurants have good selection of foods and I had no complaints on any of it. Would definitely recommend this place.;4
Amazing. The resort is clean and super friendly. I liked the activities the rifle and archery is fun. The food is amazing. The service is great. The entertainment team Angelo and Lenar are awesome and so fun.;5
The pros: Beautiful grounds  Wildlife Nice beach (bring water shoes) Snorkeling from beach Excellent buffet Incredible staff/service  The cons: Sparsely appointed room (no luggage rack, one plastic chair) Sloppily painted bathroom Porches overlook other porches Very disappointing “specialty restaurants” (Skewered vegetables were mostly raw onions and peppers) Extremely loud “DJ”/entertainment at pool (uses microphone that can be heard from the beach)  We only went to the “show” one night.  It was a “rock show” with a medley of popular hits, mostly from the 70s and 80s.  Very entertaining.;3
Our family was here for spring break we choose this resort for location and all the vegetation beautiful area. The staff was very accommodating the entertainment was great. Edgar Angelo Lenar Daniel Amber Alli are top notch performers singers and dancers. Thank you all.;5
Very friendly staff especially Alejandra who organized lots of outdoor activities and Fidel who was a superb server in one of the all inclusive restaurants . Very good cleaning service as well . We are not usually all inclusive customers but we enjoyed the delicious breakfast buffet and thought the food was of a decent quality as long as you are not looking for gourmet food .  We enjoyed the low key atmosphere in the very charming and colorful two story bungalows . The resort seemed to be close to capacity but neither the restaurants nor the swim up bar at the pool seemed overcrowded at any time . The lounge chairs were at times crowded but we still managed to score one on all 4 days. The beach was rocky and therefore we went to swim from the boat dock which had a stepladder;4
This resort was amazing! The staff are so nice.  The entertainers (Alejandra, Angelo and Leonard) were fun and friendly!  Adolfo in the main restaurant was super impressive!  He recognized us when we walked in at every meal and made sure we were taken care of.  Manuel was also super helpful with bags and anything else we needed.  I will definitely return!  One hiccup with our trip was when we had to switch rooms in between dives.  I ended up leaving a couple of items in our old room which were not returned.  The rooms are nice but at times can get warm.  The rooms have some sort of sensor, which causes the air conditioning to shut off even when you are in the room.  Overall, I loved this resort and highly recommend it.;5
Overall, I had a great experience with the Iberostar Cozumel staff was incredibly helpful, great waitstaff, huge shout out Fabian, he truly went above and beyond to make us feel at home when it came time to eat and the amenities were great.  Housekeeping was great and so polite. the room was wonderful and clean  I have a 4yo and Star Camp is just amazing, my son loved going to camp while we were there, it allowed me time to myself. They really do keep them busy! Thank you Ismael, Rosa & Karen, you guys made his trip very memorable.  We had my parents 40yr vow renewal there, the process and planning was easy. Everything was ready to go come wedding day, my mom loved her bouquet and the cake was delicious! I will say that the only bad thing was they only had one photography vendor;5
"This is an amazing resort! This was a trip with friends and family (one toddler) and the property was perfect for everyone. The pools are huge and they have a huge beach area with white sand and some trees. The lobby area is spacious and there is a lot to do! Best of all, the staff are amazing! It feels like everyone wants to help you and is genuinely happy you are there. I have been at other all inclusive resorts where this is not the case . The rooms are nice because it isn't a high rise hotel, they are all small ""villas"" in groups of 4. Makes it really easy to walk from anywhere on the property to your room. The one downside is they are pretty small. We had 3 people staying in one double and the room was pretty cramped. The beds are full size. I would either get a king bed";5
First of all, the Cozumel Airport was a breeze compared to Cancun.      Upon arriving at the resort, the grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Check in was easy and staff was good.  Next stop was Concierge to arrange our specialty dining.  He was all business and said little more.      Rooms were also OK but nothing special.  Room had a scent of raw sewage, but we were anxious to get to the beach, we unpacked, changed and headed down to water.      Though no fault of Iberostar, beach was covered with sargassum.  The beach front had plenty of chairs, some were in shade!       Next stop was beach bar.  There were 6 or 8 people waiting for drinks from one bartender. Drinks were average but the DosXX on tap was cold. The only bourbon at any bar was Jim Beam.      Food at the;3
Stayed here 10 years ago and it was great. Food was even better, accommodations were updated, staff was amazing and entertainment was waaaay beyond our expectations. They had an evening of star watching with huge telescopes, projection screens and informative interactions that was spectacular! Then fun dancing to their duo Singers that were very high end. All entertainment was well worth going! The rock night and horror night were so fun! All al la carte restaurants were good. We’ll be back.  Wish there was better coffee, but espresso/coffee machine at breakfast was good. Bar barista at pool and lobby were excellent. We brought our own yoga mats but rentals, complementary mats and classes would be appreciated.;5
We’ve returned to Iberostar Cozumel for our 3rd time now. We’ve also been to other dive resorts in Cozumel over the years. Again we were very happy with our decision. The on-site dive shop as well as the proximity to the best reef means we’ll come back again soon. The resort is ecological which is important to us. The amazing fresh food and variety kept us happy all week. The staff is very professional and always smiling. Great job everyone!;4
Such a fun place to stay, brought our two kids with us and they had the best time ever, the night shows were so fun to watch. Everyone that works on the resort are such amazing people. Food was amazing;5
Alejandra is the best!!! She’s has good entertainment  We really enjoyed the food, the dancing lessons, the beach! We loved Hector the waiter, he was sweet and always smiling and also the girl from the store. We wanna come back for sure!;5
This is my family's second trip to Iberostar Cozumel and it could not have gone better. The grounds were lovely, the food was above average for an all inclusive and the staff did their jobs well and was friendly. We will be returning again. Extra high five to the activities staff - they absolutely get the most points if there is a service staff competition! They went above and beyond. I also want to mention the hotel made the US mandated Covid protocols extremely easy to manage.;5
From the moment that we checked in to the time we checked out ten days later it was a memorable experience. We had the same person check us out of the resort that checked us in and he remembered my name as well as room number, Now that is service. Thank You Eduardo. The restaurant captains, Star Friends and Wait & Bar Staff seemed to go out of their way to acknowledge you by name and make you feel welcome and like family.  I would like to Thank and acknowledge the following Iberostar employees. Restaurant Captains Fernando, Roberto, Fabian, Omar and Fidel, Star Friends Angelo, Lenar, both Alejandra's and Edgar. Wait and Bar Staff Angely, Ana, Guadalupe, Aidan, Adolfo, Felipe, Wilber, Ivonne and Ruby for all of their Great and friendly service.  I would like to point out that we;5
The staff is great, the shows are really good some very talented singers, the hotel rooms are not overly luxuries, but definitely a quiet and relaxing vibe.  The only negative is people putting towels to save chairs, so finding a chair can be a challenge.  For us we were in the water, so didn't matter.;5
"Every part of our stay at the Iberostar Cozumel was perfect! The resort, the grounds, the staff, the food, the drinks, the rooms....all perfect! The resort was not too big and and too small. I'm glad there was not loud - awful music blasting near the pool. I like to relax and hear the ocean waves. All of the staff, bartenders, housekeeping were great. The front desk check in was fast and easy. Alex at the concierge desk was very helpful. Caesar at the Jeep rental was was excellent at explaining the rental agreement.  My wife and I think that Alejandra is the ""diamond of the resort""!! You cannot be in a bad mood while talking to Alejandra. We hope she is there when we return for our second visit!";5
Only two negatives: The internet was slow and unprotected. Some guests would place towels on the pool chairs to reserve them then go on an extended snorkeling trip and only come to the chair after they got back meanwhile many of us that played fair were left without seating. Everything else was outstanding. Multiple food stations eliminated along buffet lines and the food was delicious. The rooms were very nice and were serviced daily. The nightly entertainment was also outstanding. Booking tours was painless, we met with Carlos the first day and set up fishing, snorkeling, etc. for the week. Everything was kept clean and neat. All of the associates wore masks all the time. The resident animals were great and at the risk of upsetting some dog lovers it was a real treat to be;5
Traveled here for my sisters wedding. It was a beautiful resort, very clean, the staff was amazing! We loved interacting with the entertainers - Edgar, Lenar and team. Felt very safe. We will be back!;5
I have been a scuba diver for about 20 years and finally convinced my family to certify.  We chose Dressel Divers and Iberostar Cozumel for our adventure.  Our rooms were perfect...we had a family suite, which was two rooms adjoining, each with their own bathroom.  Very nice, extremely quiet, and always clean!  The grounds were well maintained and there was always someone picking up, trimming, caring for the resort.  Maid service was timely and good.    The food at the resort was fantastic for a family with two teenage boys.  We ate at the main buffet most of the time.  To those who complain about the food/buffet.  Yes, sometimes the food is the same.  Yes, sometimes it sits out a while.  It's a buffet.   We enjoyed their onsite Asian, Tex Mex, and Steakhouse restaurants.  The;5
The food was not very good. Only allowed to eat at specialty restaurants twice during our 5 night stay. The ribeye was inedible. Found myself eating a banana for breakfast every morning. The pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris were not sweet at all. Even the rum and cokes did not taste right. Our room was pretty bad- there was a light hanging out of the ceiling in the bathroom, a panel off the wall, the ceiling fan wobbled so much I was afraid it was going to fall on us and the AC was never fixed the entire time we were there. The water units we had to get drinking water from were a joke. The closest one to us was out of service so we had to walk all over to find others. And the ice machines never worked. For what you pay to go on an all inclusive trip, I was very;2
"Second stay in 13 months.  Room by the pool enables one to listen to the music from Albertos while relaxing on the hammock.  Food was really good. Service was excellent. Rock show by the entertainment staff was outstanding. Luis Gomez, concierge, set everything up for us as soon as we checked in and made sure to ask if everything was going well every time he saw us.  Only hiccup this trip was 9 hours without hot water. Nothing came out of the faucet when just hot was turned on. The front desk took down our name and room number, told us that our bill would be adjusted; however, when we checked out they told us there was no record of it and no adjustment was made.  We will return";5
Just returned from 10 days at the Iberostar Cozumel so here are some thoughts.  *Don't ask for iced coffee in the restaurants.  Go to the lobby bar and they will fix up a nice one for you. *All the specialty restaurants had delicious food.  The Oriental had great sushi, even for those who think they don't like it!  Salmon was wonderful at the steak one and the Oriental one.   *The buffet restaurants had a wide assortment that should please anyone.  We ate there for 10 days and always found something new to try.  French fries at the beach grill are the best!  Try the Mango Tango drink (non-alcoholic).  *To the people that suggested bringing a clothesline for the balcony, thanks.  Nice to be able to hang out towels and suits. *Some complained about the wetness of clothes and the;5
This is our second trip to Iberostar within a 3 month span.  We loved it so much the first time, we went back.  It did not disappoint.  The staff is amazingly friendly.  The food is good, and the atmosphere is perfect.  The entertainment team is awesome.  Angelo is unforgettable.  Super fun and friendly.   We went there mainly to Dive the reef using The Dressel Dive shop that is right on campus.  You can't go wrong.  GREAT dive masters who are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly.  Tamera, Omar, Javi are great but Ceci is the best.  We highly recommend them.;5
Iberostar seems to make everyone happy. There is a wonderful pool, delicious food, snorkeling off the beach, helpful staff and a calm atmosphere. Our kids did star camp each afternoon and Ismael, Rosa and Karen took great care of them and did so many activities. The staff at the restaurants and snack bar are very nice. We did a snorkeling tour set up by the front desk and saw turtles, starfish and many fish. What a fantastic place!;5
Our first time visiting the island and resort. Food was excellent, service even better! Activities throughout the day, entertainment in the evening. Edgar was amazing, so energetic and friendly, evening entertainer, and daytime event coordinator. Angelo…shakes his body like no other during the evening entertainment and super friendly during the day for activities! Isidro my favorite pool bartender! Super attentive and friendly! My daughter got married on the beach there and they did an exceptional job! Housekeeping did a great job too! We did have an issue on our first day with our a/c, they fixed it immediately. Huts are near everything, restaurants and beach and pool. Water exercises were a ton of fun too!(I’m not an exerciser!! Lol)  Very family oriented resort.  Every person;5
Beautiful property scattered with flamingos and peacocks.  Delicious food, clean lovely rooms, friendly, helpful employees, lots to do but nothing forced on you.  Went diving with Dressel Divers who were amazing. Excellent guides/equipment. Sun around the pool and sun or shade on beach.  Music but not too loud.  Other guests friendly and NO drunks like some all inclusive.  Excellent health club which is unusual.  I will definitely return.;5
Excellent  place,the best grounds,location  and food. Housekeeping this time was not as good as always,very short on towels,the last day the maid took dirty towels from the bed and put them up hanging!!! No more swans made of towels,it was a very nice special  feature..gone..,mini bar was not filled every day..;5
Wonderful resort. Great entertainment! Alejandra, Lenar, and Angelo were terrific entertainers. Entertainment 10/10, Food 8/10. Drinks 7/10, resort 10/10, rooms 10/10. Resort and beach was very clean and there was plenty to do daily.;5
This was me and my wife's 9th time to this resort. Such an amazing way to relax and unwind. The resort grounds are beautiful and we love the cottage style rooms. The buffet restaurants serve a wide variety of food. The staff are so gracious and friendly. We have to give a shout out to the bartenders, waiters, and waitresses. Thank you Daniela and Angelo for keeping us laughing at the pool everyday. Thank you Ana, Glendy, Adrian, Raymundo, Edgar and Reyes for another amazing week and your hospitality. Thank you Rosa for the big smiles and greeting everyday. Another amazing vacation with our friends from Cozumel. Thank you all so much.          Sincerely Mike and Stephanie.;5
We visited at the beginning of March for a few nights. Iberostar was an amazing paradise and it was so hard to leave there! We initially booked Explorean but read that the beach was closed so cancelled and booked at Iberostar, BEST decision ever!! I will definitely be back at Iberostar and am not interested in checking out other resorts as our experience here was just amazing from start to finish. All the staff are incredibly kind and helpful! COVID rules are well enforced and most areas are 'open' spaces so it feels safe eating in the breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets. Beds and rooms were very clean and comfy! We had an issue with our shower not draining but I think it was fixed.   Again, all the staff are incredible and work hard to make sure you have all that you need.;5
My friend and I visited the resort this spring break after my family had been here years ago, and I was reminded why I think of this place so fondly. After talking to many of the other guests, I heard that they have had the same experience and keeping coming back regularly.  The staff of this resort are absolutely unbeatable. This includes the servers, bartenders, and of course, the entertainment team. Alejandra and Edgar knew our names after our first night there and went out of their way to give us a memorable trip every day afterwards.   Every meal was delicious and a great experience because of the friendly hosts and waiters. We especially enjoyed the Mexican restaurant on the resort.   Could not imagine a better way to spend my spring break and was super sad to leave, but;5
