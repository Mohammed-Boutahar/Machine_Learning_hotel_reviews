As expected in that it is fine and would suit a lot of people looking for a bargain and somewhere to be in for a few hours overnight, but I wouldn't do again.   Pros: The location is amazing tube very accessible nearby and lots of restaurants and shops. There was a locker room available to drop our bags off first. The value of the room. The facilities are just fine, and you get what you pay for. Fridge available in the room.  Cons: The walls are so thin to the hallway you hear absolutely everything it is just so loud which is why i wouldn't stay again. On the floor we stayed on the toilets wasn't male/female it was mixed which i didn't like. there were showers available for women/men only. I didn't look in or use the kitchen. There is a TV/lounge type room as well which i didn't;3
Very poor customer service from word for as the man in reception started shouting at me because I didn't have photo ID. Was very unhelpful with how to solve the issue, just saying it was impossible I didn't have photo ID and I shouldn't have booked.  Finally given a very tiny room with no storage.  Bathroom dirty with something red on tiles and soap dispenser, asked to clean but although someone had been in room nothing had changed.  Very poor customer service;1
There were cockroaches in our room. Rooms weren’t great either, even without roaches you could find better ones for the same price. I would not recommend this place. I doubt they’ll fix the roach problem, as other older reviews say the same thing. I should have read more reviews before booking.;1
I got a room with two of my friends, the worst decision ever. The place is like a trap house, the smell of weed and the needles everywhere. This place shouldnt even be approved by the nation, dont go here!!!!1;1
I’ve stayed her numerous times over the years and it used to be okay but it’s getting tragically worse. EVERYTHING was unclean ! The staff are not accommodating at all and seen to their own conversation before greeting us on arrival. We were late into London and had plans so couldn’t find somewhere else to stay and I didn’t even feel confident to approach reception about the state of the room because the place hadn’t been cleaned in MONTHS by the looks of it. On checkout I showed reception images and said it was a disgrace only to be told I should’ve mentioned it sooner. I have no doubt that many guests had mentioned something. That was not a days worth of dirt and grime! AVOID. AVOID.;1
We stayed at this hostel for 3 nights, but please do not book here. The rooms where aful (dirty sheets, mold on the bed, moldy showers with hair,..). The doors are very loud and so are some people that also stay there. Woke up from the noise of someone throwing up twice. The staff is very rude and made us feel very unsafe. It’s not at all like on the pictures! The morning we where packing the staff knocked on our door, accusing us that we threw water out of the window and they where going to call the police if we weren’t gone in 30 minutes. They ruined our citytrip, please do not book here!!;1
The location of the hostel is great and easy access from Paddington Station. It was my short trip from South East England as I have some personal matters to be done in London. It is not bad if you have low requirements ans staying here just for a very few nights, or just wishing for a place to sleep. The receptionist is a bit rude when I checked in at the afternoon.  The single room with double bed is clean and nice until I discovered there's dirt on the bed sheet by the window side (It is the unused side).  The bedroom doors outside the aisle side and the door to the aisles don't have locks on it so it causes massive noise when others walking in and out from their bedroom and walking via the aisle, especially in the middle of night. Some of them talks loudly in the middle of;3
"Stayed her for an event in London with some friends. Upon arrival in the room, we noticed an awful smell that was like something decomposing in the room, causing us to get out spray to make it some what bearable. The first night was bad, we were accused of being loud ten mins before we were going to bed, only for the accuser to be loud and the night receptionist to bang on every door down the hall as well; not mention he was creepy which for female travellers is unsettling. The second night wasn't any better, as the room to the left of us, 333, I believe were loud, with banging on god knows what. Would have reported this but the receptionist didn't appear to understand us when we asked basic questions about amenities such as wifi; by the way they charge £1 per hour of usage.";2
Received the worst customer service in my whole life, was disrespected, staff were rude and make customers feel unsafe. They took advantage of us and smirked watching us stand for 20 minutes whilst taking a personal phone call because they knew we needed somewhere to stay. Saw them shouting at kids. Please save money and book elsewhere. I wish I had listened to the previous reviews because found a much nicer booking same price in London.;1
The worst place I ever stayed at! Abercorn House London is badly maintained, very loud and extremely filthy. Worst hygiene in bathroom. The toilets in Abercorn House London were constantly clogged. Poo in loo everywhere and dried urine stains on seat. The pictures below says it all. I also found that all the room (floor, ceiling, window sills, heater, table and curtains) had covered a thick layer of dust. Dirt stains on bed linen and stains on the walls that could easily be removed. I also noticed that a lot of long hairs were on the room floor and on the table. The bed was as hard as rock. There are no door knobs which makes it hard to close the doors without slamming so everyone pulls the door shut and it can be heard from all over. The walls were very thin, too. Towards the;1
You probably wont get much sleep if your a light sleeper as there is way to much noise to get any good sleep. The facilities and staff are adequate and you definitely get what you pay for.  Location is amazing though and really easy to get to anyway you need to go to via the tube station 2 minutes away;3
Positives first: Fairly clean, nice area.  Negatives: Didn’t get any housekeeping for the duration of the stay (3 nights) which would have been nice during a heatwave. The staff was not exactly unfriendly but very uninterested. Walls are paperthin and when you live next to people from a certain Southern European country who are notoriously noisy, that is an issue.   Overall, I’m satisfied, but will not choose this hotel again.;3
The place is very dirty, unfriendly and rude staff, they look like to make us a favor.  There is BLOOD in my room, everyday, and they didnt clean, and laughs when I report the issue. Stay away from this place.;1
My partner and I stayed here four nights in early July, with immediate regrets in booking. The plus points are close to Hammersmith Underground, pubs, restaurants and shops, located on a quieter street off busy Hammersmith Road but that's about it. Our room was generally clean and equipped with a fridge, small freezer, bowls, plates and cutlery. There were a few kitchen facilities on the first floor but no pots or pans to cook with on the hobs. Separate shower rooms are passable but shared by both sexes. And now for the downsides... bad customer service at reception, dark and dour landings and corridors, noisy doors and no sound proofing between rooms, wifi has to be bought at crazy rates, we were asked to keep our door closed on Saturday evening by what we assume was a member;2
We stayed in a room that doesn't have a private bathroom. We were supposed to stay for 4 nights but we have to look for another accommodation because we felt VERY UNSAFE in this hotel. Advised them on the morning of the second day, but because of their refund policy of 72 hours once you are checked in, we didn't get any money back even for 1 day.   CONS:  - NO SEPARATE toilet and shower for women - VERY NOISY, people singing karaoke in the middle of the night, no noise control from the management - Showers, toilets and kitchen are DISTY and SMELLY - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE from the front desk - NO FREE WIFI, you have to pay in cash if you need access to wifi which is 1 pound per hour - elevator wasn't working when we were there - NO Air Condition  NOT RECOMMENDED for women;1
We booked this hotel as we thought there was parking - we had it marked as criteria upon one of the booking websites - no parking is available so we had to change our travel plans. The photos of the 'hotel' make the rooms look clean and presentable - they are not!!!   The walls were marked through use which is to be expected (but they were extremely marked - i& mho it needed redecorating) but the private bathroom was dirty, I didn't even want to stand in the shower and the chest of draws in the room had some weird brown stains in them that I didn't want to imagine what they were.  There was no tv in the room - just a communal tv room and although you are provided with cups and a fridge there was no kettle.  (After the state of the room I didn't dare look in the fridge itself and;1
We had a twin with private bathroom, it was small but did the job. The room was clean enough, bedding and towels were clean. It was a bit worn.  Staff were pleasant. The road was very quiet even though it's only a 5 minute walk from Hammersmith Tube & bus station and high street.  We had a fridge in our room, it was old but functional. We didn't use the shared areas much but they seemed clean and functional. I wouldn't come here for a holiday but it was good enough for what we needed, a cheap overnight stay for work. We were able to leave luggage in the luggage room after check out which was helpful when we were leaving.;3
Place was a total dump. I wouldnt put farm animals in it.  I asked for a quiet room AWAY from lifts...so they put me right next to one. Theres no soundproofing, no carpets so you hear every little noise.   All the facilities are communal. Reception staff were nonchalont. Uninterested. They took all personal info without good reason. Place is totally grim.   The room was disgusting. Old cheap ass furniture, no carpet, dirt and grubby marks on the walls and flaking paint.  Showers and pipework were disgusting. Dirty. Like a rugby club bath house. I didnt use any of the facilities. There were communal kitchens and some crockery and room fridge provided. Obviously i used nothing.  Noisy. Impossible to sleep. Avoid at all costs. Only reason i stayed was because of the temporary bus;1
Noisy. Dirty shared bathrooms. But you get what you pay for and it’s fantastic value for money.   Felt like I needed a bath after using the shower.   However at £40 for central-ish London next to a tube station it’s an absolute steal.   London is an idiotic city anyway;2
Stayed with friends for two nights, we were able to leave luggage before checking in and after which was useful. The staff were fine and the rooms were clean. If you are going to be out and about most the day and night it is great place to stay as super cheap meaning you can spend more being out and about. We had a good experience as was expecting it to be like the other reviews this year which were poor.;4
over the last two years since I discovered this hostel I have stayed around five times because it is not as expensive as hotels in London and I needed to save a few pounds as we all do given how expensive London can be. There is cleaning there which is good but it is manned by well male not polite staff (not sexist just fact). Occasionally polite but mainly not and I get a distinct feeling that we are filmed in our rooms due to some comments I heard from a staff member talking near me. I have had some politeness but a few times the opposite.   The facitlits are a room with cutlery and plate and mug plus a kitchen nearby and shower room and toilets. They are clean usually. But staff are very unhelpful if something goes wrong eg kettle not working I went to reception and he did;1
We opened the dorm door and it smelt like something had died in there. We booked the 4 beds the room had (room 409) thinking we would have our own room. Unfortunately we were not alone as the room had rats crawling around the ceiling space. We think the smell was rat urine. Showers were filthy, with a smeggy film over the floor. We felt cleaner before we showered. I've stayed in dumps, in third world countries and nothing compared to this. Absolute health hazard.;1
Worst place I've ever stayed, dirty, uncomfortable rooms and the toilets and shower were awful - the kitchen had no utensils, staff are useless and couldn't care less about anything - guests were too noisy and filthy, spend more money elsewhere and avoid here like the plague.;1
I never usually leave reviews but.. What can I say, portabello beach is stunning and I have never visited such a warm and caring guesthouse before now. From start to finish, Angela was personable and welcoming. Both Angela and William couldn't do enough for us. They accommodated our family, cooking  food off the menu or our son. We will definitely be returning soon;5
If your staying one or two nights it's grand, tbh it's not that noisy as in living room closed at 11pm, however main problem definately is people getting kicked out without any apparent proper reason and also middle Eastern staff who are on a power trip, don't book for long term;2
Have stayed here many times over last couple of months Fantastic location close to Hammersmith Bus and Underground station but on a back street so little passing traffic Rooms with en-suite bathroom (rather than shared bathroom) are clean, reasonable size (not large though!) and plenty of hot water in shower Exellent value for money in this part of London for a basic hotel room;4
Abercorn House London is a budget but an  amazing hostel. The evironment is serene the staff are dedicated, hardworking and courteous. I just love it.  Don't take my word for it visit here and see for yourself.;5
I've stayed there twice. The beds are pretty good, the size of the twin room wasn't bad and the bathrooms and showers were quite clean. The soundproofing of the rooms is very bad, if you're a light sleeper you might find yourself annoyed. They charge for the wifi, which isn't very pleasant. The location is very convenient for tourism in London and it's very close to a tube station. I would go there again.;3
"The Abercorn House is a quite basic hostel in Hammersmith, but with plenty of single rooms, very close to the tube.  I was on the fourth floor, which appeared to be all single/double rooms.  There were two toilet rooms and one shower room.  Toilets were sometimes not left very clean by visitors.  The showers were only just OK; the room was cold and the hot water not very powerful; there was nowhere to store dry clothing (no hook on the door, for example) other than over the top the door (which does not go to the ceiling) – this might be a bit disconcerting as I think the floor was mixed (there were no segregated toilets or showers).    Although there were only 4 showers, the floor had 5 kitchens, each with one or two electric cookers (oven + rings), microwave oven, kettle and in";3
Would not EVER stay here again, or recommend it. However, if you enjoy grumpy, rude staff, boiling hot rooms, the heady & constant waft of illegal substances being smoked inside and outside rooms, groups of men smoking & shouting at each other outside into the late hours, having food stolen from your room by someone with access to your room key while you're out, and Reception staff who don't care when you raise illegal drugs & theft issues, then you've hit the jackpot!;1
Spent 4 nights in November with a friend, twin room ensuite. We wanted a budget stay and we got what we paid for. Room and bathroom were clean, however the hostel needs some TLC The bottom handle of the side table/drawer was broken off when we got there. The ensuite, while clean, smelled slightly of sewage the whole stay. While that wasn't super bothersome, what was bothersome was that the heat did not extend to the ensuite. It was always cold in there. Also some of the grout had mold which again was not bothersome, but just not nice to see.   Overall, it was a good stay. Nothing save the temperature of the ensuite was bothersome. The room was clean, I slept well, there was a mini-fridge provided and dishware in case we wanted to use the kitchens. There was also a lift which was;3
Stayed here one night - room was basic but was clean. The lock on the front door was awkward to use on arrival but managed to unlock eventually. There is a big wardrobe and fridge in room. Nothing special but was a good stay.;3
Stayed for one night. The staff were friendly enough & the location is excellent. The room was clean & tidy but the bed itself was incredibly creaky. Prices are okay for the location. You pretty much get what you pay for.;3
Got a private “deluxe” double room but there was nothing deluxe about it. I’m not a snob in any way, but I was expecting at least a bed, not a mattress placed on a wooden base. The room was no more than 10 square meters big, so it’s good for bonding with your partner. You can hear absolutely everything through the paper thin walls, so you can bond with guests in other rooms as well. The place is a 4-minute walk from Hammersmith underground station, a Tesco and loads of great restaurants. If you need a place to just spend the night, that’s the accommodation for you.;2
Lovely hostel for the price! Very clean! Great facilities! Don’t understand the previous comments about the staff as they were very polite and happy towards me. Quiet street and yes some noise, but it’s a hostel not a hotel... overall lovely weekend stay during carnival... will be back!;5
Went there on summer camp. The rooms are quite small. It is ok-ish for cleaning. The owners are not really nice. I was insulted by some of the people staying for the night. Very noisy place. The location is not bad.;2
This house is perfect for a low cost trip with friends. The rooms are not very big but very clean for the price. Moreover, it is well located. The plus : the bathroom, with a real shower (not one with a drape). The minus : the corridors are a little bit noisy, I recommand the use of earplug for a nice sleep.;5
"The only positive thing during the stay was that the room was clean, the fridge we had in our room worked and it was near Hammersmith station. Everything else were so bad. The guys at the counter were extremely rude, they didn't greet us when we arrived and looked upset like we interrupted their conversation or something. Our room were on the bottom floor and the window we had were located in their ""indoor garden"" so we could hear the staff talk. The walls were so thin we could hear everything outside, from the guests on the hall and the room next door.";1
My first time at a hostel and it was a pleasant one. The fact that there are kitchens is great as it saves us money on paying for food at lunch time, we could make sandwiches to take along. There are lots of food outlets (Nando’s, Tortilla, pizza places etc...) very very close (5mins walk maximum) and a little Tesco too! It’s a 15 minute walk from abercorn to Olympia London which is where we were for three days. The only negatives were it was very very warm inside there seemed to be little ventilation in the corridors which makes coming in after a hot day horrid as you have to either climb the stairs or get into the even hotter lift! However the rooms have windows you can open right out to cool the room down if you keep them open all the time, we were staying when it was;4
We stayed 4 nights here. It was good being close to the underground, so wasn't much of  a walk with our bags. Not the friendliest or most enthusiastic or helpful reception staff. Was a good price for the 4 nights. Close to alot of things. Didn't get much sleep most of the nights due to noise from other guests, constant door slamming and one lady deciding to pace the hall at 2am. Expected of a hostel though, so if you're wanting sleep and very tired from a long flight not the best place. Also there was only one shower in the womans section that had hot water and the floor was constantly slippery by the toilets, so wasn't the best.;3
The location is great as only 2-3 mins away from Hammersmith underground and therefore there are shops at Broadway and a good selection of restaurants near by. Upon arriving at the hostel approx 7pm there were a few people sitting outside that had obviously been drinking and could appear intimidating to some. I had booked a twin, private room for myself and niece as it had said on website that only over 18s could stay in the dormitory.  So was a bit surprised when I was questioned as to who my niece was, how old she was etc.  Upon telling them 16 my passport and money was thrown back at me and I was told I had to have her parents permission for her to stay there with me.  So after a delayed flight of 4 hours to get to London I had to phone her mum, get her to email the hostel;3
The Positives: Excellent location  - 2 mins from tube station, clean & tidy room, nice Courtyard to sit out in. Value for money, as in cheap & (kind of) cheerful...!  The NEGETATIVES: The room was NOT as pictured, there was no small table & chairs to sit at. The room was tiny, just enough room for the beds, fridge & cupboard! Our room (no.7) was literally next door to Reception, and was a  nightmare! The luggage room was opposite so was a constant stream of people coming/going all night! Therefore, almost NO sleep for 2 nights. We heard every conversation, in fact at times felt like we were in the same room!!! So, if offered either No. 7 or 8 room keys - just say NO!!! Maybe higher floors would be better?;3
Stayed one night with friends to celebrate our 40th anniversary as nurses. Abercorn House was our original nurses home when we started training at the nearby Charing Cross Hospital. Booked a twin room but got a room with 2 sets of bunk beds. Room clean and fairly quiet except my bed which creaked every time I moved. Room had a fridge but that was the extent of the facilities. Could do with a mirror in the room. Toilets and showers clean. There is a small cafe downstairs selling provisions at reasonable prices.  Overall, for the price, Abercorn House is great value for money in central London.;4
A family of 2 adults were mistakenly given a 3-bed room on 1st night (booked for 3 nights for 2pax) and was informed to move at 11.45pm almost mid night due to their own Front Desk mistake and we refused till we can move out the next morning. We were not in the room when our room was opened and a written note was found on top of the fridge, scarring us both for Invasion of Privacy in our absence.   Couldn't sleep till after midnight as room and window faces main road, smokers chatting away below loudly and Doors banging slamming from any room doors, kitchen and bathroom. Kitchen well equipped (oven, hot stove & microwave) except for any cooking utensils.  Good location as bus ride away from Westfield shopping mall and Shepherd's Bush and walking distance to nearest subway;3
We stayed here last weekend (Sat-Tue) and we really enjoyed our first time to London.  + The hotel is in Hammersmith, near to the centre of London. The transportation is good (tube, buses) and there are many shopping facilities nearby.  The staff was friendly, especially the guy who was at night at the reception.  The rooms were clean and simple and we did not have any problems with the bathroom outside.  We liked that we were able to use the kitchen and the luggage room free.   - Everything was ok, no negatives, but only two things to say. The rooms were a little noisy, mainly in the mornings, and there could be some extra things (like travelling sewing kit) at the reception.  If you need a simple and cheap accommodation for a pleasure trip in London we recommed it.;4
It really is all about the location. Only a quick walk (5-8 minutes) to both of Hammersmith tube stations so very convenient. Very cheap accommodation for London. Stayed in a private twin room, which was very basic and the beds were clean but mega uncomfortable. OK for a thrifty one night stop over, but because of how uncomfortable the beds were, wouldn't stay for more than 1 night;3
Stayed in a bunk room that had some flooding issues.  The windows did not close.  The doors slammed.  The closest toilet was 2 hallways away, and shared by 15 rooms.  Small coed shower rooms that didn't have a changing area and was not clean. Do not stay on the 4th floor if you stay here.;2
I can recommend this place for people going to explore London, not for relax. The room was small, with single bed and bunk bed (for 3 people) but was clean. The house is located a long way from centre but it is not problem - London is very well-communicated. You can use metro to all moving to city centre - what is more in this way you can save money, because Abercorn House is not expensive accomodation.  The only one minus are shared bathrooms and toilets - but we were aware of that.;4
I  stayed  1  night here. it is on a  quiet road about 200 metres from Hammersmith Station. At  the  station is a huge mall with everything  you  would need plus  loads of restaurants and pubs  nearby.  I was  dissapointed that the wifi was not free. It was £1  per hour so I bought £5 and it lasted me  the  night although I had to keep dis abling my wifi  when not using it.  My  room was  a double but in fac turned out to be 2  single beds pushed  together  with 1 pillow and  1 duvet per bed. My windows were  clean and the floor was  stone  with no matting r  carpet. A double  wardrobe and a  side  table with drawers both dating  from the 70,s and not in the best of  condition were  supplied. There was  a small ld  fridge in my room for food storage. Cutlery and plates were;3
Good rooms, good service, good shared bathrooms and good place in the city, 5 mins walking distance from metro station. Unfortunately no kitchen supplies in the shared kitchen although the kitchen area was good.;4
Absolutely disgusted with the way the staff treated me and my family member today, they asked for proof of Id and threw my passport out of there little box, disrespectfull staff that really need to sort there attitudes out;1
We stayed here for one night as we were attending a concert at The Eventim Apollo, Hammersmith. Location was great, close to shops, restaurants and pubs. The station was a 5 minute walk. We were able to book into our room at 12.30pm and we were pleased to see a very clean, tidy room. The beds were comfy and we had our own separate toilet and shower. There was also a nice size fridge and wardrobe in our room. We would definitely recommend and would stay here again. The property was in a quiet location and we felt very safe. A great place to stay at a great price. Thank you.;4
Stayed here for 2 nights for capitals summertime ball in a twin room. Hotel is 3 minute walk from the tube stop which goes all over london so very handy. The rooms are very basic but clean and our room came with a fridge great for putting beers/wine in. The hotel is in a nice location in hammersmith so not dodgy and lots of restaurants and bars, including a wetherspoons and nandos -£3 for a gin and tonic in hammersmith is not bad. For about £30 a night you really can't complain - will be coming back.;4
What can i say. Yes there are more expensive places in town. But more effort could be made.  Its dirty. I can smell what could be illegal substances. When they write self catering they mean you need to buy your own cooking utensils...  The staff seem to think it is funny. Sigh.  Next time i will read reviews before i blindly book somewhere.;1
I have be staying at the Abercorn House over the last six years at least 4-7 times a year as I travel frequently to London for conferences. This will be my last visit. Conditions of the place are as described in many reviews, basic and minimal. However, over the last few visits staff seem to become more and more rude with absolutely NO EFFORT given to making you feel welcomed. I don't expect a red carpet at this price point but I also don't expect to be treated like a nuisance for asking for information when I choose your establishment to spend my money. At this price point there are many other options in London and I will taking my business elsewhere moving forward.;2
My booking was for a double room, with a double bed.  At check-in I was being offered single bed, then 2 single beds, finally I got the double bed I had booked.   The corridors to the rooms are narrow, enough room for 1 person to walk, not enough room to pass people properly. Not good when they are painting the walls!!!  the doors in the corridor are a pain.   The room was basic, kind of clean. Bed is on the way out. The bathroom was good, rainfall shower.   Room wasn't cleaned properly, dust balls and dirt on the floor, dirty walls too.;3
The room was too, too small. Extremely tiny. Minimal amenities provided except liquid soap in bathrooms and a microwave thankfully. The staf at reception seemed bored with the job and least interested in mincing words out of his mouth. Though they did allow us to store luggage before check in at no additional cost.;2
I was surprised how quiet it was at night and how it was close to the tube. Nothing to complain about really. The bathroom could be a little bit a bigger, so that's maybe one thing. Had a comfortable bed and clean sheets.;4
We stayed here in November 2018. I honestly don't have a problem with the place just don't know how to qualify it. It is definitely not a hotel as it has bunks in rooms of 4 (maybe other room types too, i can't confirm) so if you're 2 you'll still stay in a room of 4 with empty bunks. The other guests we met were mostly eastern-europeans, etc and kept only to themselves, couldn't really chat with anyone. There's a TV room but we gave it a pass, we rather went to the excellent pubs nearby. i cannot really complain about anything else than the softness of the bed. For me it was waaaay too soft, I had back pain in the morning. The shared bathrooms could get busy in peak hours when people leave for work but are cleaned well regularly which is a big plus.  The walls are rather thin;3
"Booked a ""double bed"" with my girlfriend, instead got two flimsy single beds that came apart faster than you could say - sheet! The place is a bit of a joke, but then Hammersmith Apollo is around the corner so it makes sense. Not going back.";1
I booked this for a cheap weekend in London and was pleasantly surprised. its only 5 mins walk from Hammersmith train station which gives easy access to Heathrow and Gatwick. The place is very clean, Our room and bathroom was spotless. There is a little cafe which is very cheap. I got breakfast of porridge, 2 croissants, a banana and tea for £3. There is a fridge in the room and you have access to a TV room and a fully equipped kitchen. There is a garden at the rear with plenty of seating and a patio where we had breakfast  It is close to restaurants and pubs in Hammersmith. I would defo stay here again. My only complaints are that the bed was very soft and we were on the ground floor (room 8) which is right beside the patio and can be a bit noisy.;5
We do not generally stay in Hostels, but I decided to book this place as a one night stop over to see a show at the Apollo which was in walking distance.  We had a private room and bathroom and I have to say, it was very clean and bright.  Unfortunately, there was no TV and they were single beds, but it was better than I have heard other Hostels to be.;3
Had a booking for 7nights, checked in to MY room for the first 3 nights then got told to move out of MY room for someone else and I got put in to the worse looking room possible. Had no space at all my bags when I walked in, the floor was filthy and disgusting, stains all over the place and the staff just started to stretch and act as if nothing was wrong when I told them I want something else. Completely disappointed in this place.;1
small but neat n clean rooms.  paying for a Hostel so no need to expect like a Hotel, good washrooms, and kitchen but NO AIRCON or FAN in room, friendly and helping staff, sometimes you may find bugs in the bed.;3
I hate to leave a bad review because the staff was so nice but... It's like the management is only doing the minimum, if that.  Beds are very cheap and horribly SQUEAKY. We booked a private twin but were given a 4 bed bunk room with very little space.  Showers had no shelves or hooks which makes no sense for a shared shower space. Kitchen - I wouldn't use it. TV room / common room is shut away and not very comfortable.    I wouldn't recommend for solo travelers who like meeting others on their trips.  We did like the location, though. And, of course, the staff was very friendly.  Not sure who owns or manages this but they need to step up their game.;2
We slept one night in the hostel and it wasn't clean. There were a terrible smell in corridor and stains on sheets. There were no hook or table to put clothes in showers and everything was wet. I don't recommend.;2
I stayed at Abercorn House for a night just over two weeks ago, with my son. When we first arrived we were pleased to find friendly staff, a good sized room, and the hostel seemed very clean. However, lying in bed reading that night, I noticed an insect on my pillow. When I squashed it, to my horror blood squited out. I few minutes later I noticed another. When I lifted my pillow, three more were crawling along the edge of my mattress (the sheet didn't quite reach).I went down to reception and asked to change rooms. I was told that there were none free, but was offered an extra sheet! Obviously I didn't sleep. I spent the night squashing bugs as they approached me. Most were filled with blood. In the morning, exhausted and horrified, I went back to reception (with some;1
Upon arriving, you have to pay the end of the deposit before being allowed into the room (which is fair). However, there is no easy access lift, and we were not directed to one. We had made our booking over a month in advance (two twin rooms), and had asked them to put a mattress in one of the rooms two weeks before our trip for a new depend coming with us. Upon arrival, we were informed that they had messed up our booking and gave us two double-bed rooms. They entirely forgot about the mattress, and told us that one of us could just sleep on blankets. When we protested, they agreed to bring up the mattress by six. We ended up waiting in the room until half eight before the mattress arrived. We also had medication for a disabled friend that needed to be refrigerated. The fridge;2
Clean and Basic, snacks and coffees good value for money. Ideal for train travel as the place is 2 minute walk from Hammersmith station also ideally situated for the Apollo theatre. Definitely no frills;4
Staying here with my my mum as it was the cheapest option for Wimbledon. We booked a twin room with a fridge. Shared bathroom. We were really happy when we first arrived. Room was clean & bright. Until the door slamming starts! It’s honestly horrendous. Woke me up constantly in middle of night. There’s no signs telling people to be aware of this. We were careful to let doors close quietly but then what’s the point when nobody else gives a toss? You can also hear every word people say in corridor & it echos.  It’s a shame as it’s the only real negative about the place as it is a 5 min walk from Hammersmith underground, clean, friendly & cheap. Unfortunately though - unless you wear ear plugs, you won’t get a good sleep. It’s 7.03 just now. I’ve been up since 0530. Wish I could;2
Stayed at the hostel as a friend and I were attending a concert at the nearby eventim Apollo and wanted something that wasn’t £150+ (as essentially everything in London on a Saturday night is) - for the price it really wasn’t bad. The room was a decent size, our only issue is that we had a requested a room with two single beds (and this was on our booking confirmation) but we were given a double bed instead, however this wasn’t enough of an issue to complain as we didn’t mind too much. The shower room was much nicer than expected and very clean. We didn’t make use of the kitchen facilities but they also looked clean. The staff were very nice and helpful during our stay and we never had any issues in that regard, however be aware that if you want to split the bill between two of;4
"I have stayed here twice.  The first time was alright, a large room, relatively clean but the place was terribly noisy.  This time, however, we were in a shoebox that was far too small for two people and made intolerable by the warm weather – there was no fan and no air con obviously so we had to leave the window open all night therefore exposing ourselves to the gobshite neighbours (ear plugs proved unsatisfactory).  The bed was so soft that every time I moved I woke my partner up and the bathroom was so small that you actually had to squeeze past the sink just to sit down on the toilet; if you’re overweight you might actually seriously struggle (I’m not joking by the way).  The place is very noisy too, doors are slammed shut with little thought to residents, the walls are rice";2
It is one of the worst places where I have stayed. First of all, all the workers are foreigners and they are chaing everyday the rules in the hostel. I can not imagine that they are charching extra for internet. You pay £1 per hour. Even you pay for the internet you cannot open all the web sites. Some web sites are blocked and can't be opened. The TV room is a disaster. It is smelling very bad and not confortable at all. The corridors are smelling very very bed. The room was very dirty. Ther is nothing available in the cafeteria. I don't want to say anything about the toilots, kitchen and shower areas. The is no chance to keep you healt after staying here. This is more dirty pension the a host that we know.;1
Rooms are simple nothing complex,as I never watch TV it wa refreshing to have rooms without TV, rooms are clean and shower is ok. Fridge freezer in every room but found it a bit noisy so first thing I do is switch it off, great6 if you are spending a longer period of time as there is a shared kitchen. Hotel is close to big supermarket (Tesco) and many venues and access very easy by public transport.;4
Excellent, clean, friendly, crisp white bedding and towels. Friendly reception. Lovely area. Easy to get to. Makes London affordable and more money for shopping. Yeahhhhhhh😎😎😎🌼🌼🌼✔️✔️✔️🎈🎈🎈only annoying bit bring plug in ear plugs, the constant slamming of the door in the hallway as people come in. Also you can hear other people talking in hallway. However, the price makes it all alittle bit more exciting. Down load the app for citylink and uber and it works out cheaper catching these taxis and share your ride or get a free ride.;5
This hostel is cheap, clean and comfortable. It's really near to Hammersmith station, so you can reach Piccadilly or Knightsbridge in a very short time. Beds are comfortable and they give you a towel for the shower;5
This hostel is conveniently close to the Hammersmith underground and in a nice area. The room I stayed in with my fiancé was very spacious, clean, well-priced and it had a fridge! Closeby there is a tesco store and the hostel has lots of shared kitchen areas so great for making simple meals.   The hostel provides bowls, plates and cutlery however anything else such as pots and pans weren't readily available, maybe upon request but we didn't ask.  Overall a great and well-priced place to stay in the big Don.;5
Positives: My daughter and I shared a private room with two twin beds and private bathroom with shower. Room was clean. Beds reasonably comfortable. Location in Hammersmith was excellent. Walk to many shops, Kings Court mall, pubs, places to eat. Tube station less than 5 minutes walk. Price was best we could find.  Negatives: Staff is downright surly and rude - be prepared not to be given any information about how to find your room or hostel amenities and you may even get yelled at (we were!). Also room is very noisy (doors are constructed in such a way that each time they are opened or closed it sounds like slamming doors) - this happened throughout the night - made it really hard to get any sleep. Also housekeeping vacuums at 8 am in hallway right outside your door. No free;3
I stayed here for a weekend, a middle aged woman on my own.  I had a room with a double bed, and my own en suite shower room.  The room was spotlessly clean, though perhaps could do with being painted!  For the price, it is good value.  There was a kitchen with cookers, sinks, microwave, toaster and kettle, but no pots and pans - there were frying pans for sale at the shop at reception.  There was crockery and cutlery in the room.  The room had a small wardrobe with hangers, a bedside table with a lamp, and a fridge.  It was comfortable.  There were a lot of tourists, younger people and sports teams in the hostel over the weekend.  The noise level was fine, and I had two good nights' sleep. The staff were helpful, though they are not of the 'have a nice day' variety!  I found;4
"Three friends of mine and I have been in this hostel, in a four-bed room, so the experience has been a little bit different from what you usually have in a hostel.  The room was enough clean, but very small for four adult, male people; it was very warm though. There were not a lot of people in the hostel, so the common kitchen and bathroom were quite comfortable to use, even if there wasn't any pot in the kitchen. When it comes to service and staff... Very disappointed. Some members of the staff are very impolite, and I think that 1£ for a hour of WiFi, in London, in 2018, is a shame.";3
If you are a bat and don’t want to sleep during the night, this is the perfect place to be! The room was clean and tidy. The mattress was very uncomfortable and very bad quality. Also very rude staff...;1
We stayed for 4 days and it was fine. It is a little loud on the hallway, but we didn’t mind. Rooms are pretty clean and spacious for what you are paying. You have 3 min walk to the Hammersmith underground (and good caffee on the way). Overall 4/5*;4
I only stayed one night because was horrible!! Very dirty rooms, very dirty bathrooms and it smells like pee. Moreover, there was a dirty sock from the previous customer and the bad sheets had blood... and when I took a shower there was not hot water... it was a horrible experience!!! DONT GO TO THIS HOSTEL!!! And if you go there you have to pay with cash because they don’t admit credit card!!!;1
We stayed in this hostel as we were attended a gig at the Hammersmith apollo so wanted somewhere close and cheap for one night. The accommodation was very cheap by London prices bt for a reason. The window in our room was smashed and covered up and the room was as small as it could be to fit in a bed and a tiny wardrobe. The bathrooms are communal but clean. Many of the residents apear to live there?! And little English is spoken at the front desk. It suited ok for one night but I wouldn't stay any longer.;2
If you’re looking for a really low budget stay and you don’t mind being woken up by other guests in the middle of the night multiple times, or after ‘cleaning’ your room, finding all of your belongings left previously on the bed thrown into a corner on the ground, or sleeping in stained bedsheets, or having to use a towel with weird yellow stains on it, than this is your place to go! The walls are paper thin, the doors don’t seal well and the beds are rolling on wheels during the night when you turn around in your bed. The bathroom and the common kitchen were okay. The staff gave 0 fck that you might sleep longer than 6am and shouting around to each-other in the corridors as well as doing the loudest possible type of cleaning: vacuuming.;2
Abercorn house is conveniently located within the city center of London. It is proximal to the Hammersmith and City London undergound line as well as the Circle line. From the stations, the place is about a mere 3-5 minute walk away. There isn’t much to be seen in that area by comparison to Soho or Lambeth but there are still some decent bars, pubs and restaurants within the vicinity.   The accommodation does not come with free wifi and one would need to pay a couple of Sterling or something to avail of the service. The room we stayed in is a Double bedroom with no bathroom inside however there are bathrooms that are gender specific which I would gladly say are clean and well kept.   I advise travelers to check-in in spite of being at the latter part of the city center.;3
The room was fine, the wall of the room was hin though. the bathrooms were clean. The location is good, too. But the most of the receptionists were really not friendly.  I got sick early in the morning on the day of departure and even called an ambulance. As the doctor said, I should rest and not fly on that day, I decided to stay there for another night. I called them and the room was available. But they made me to go down to reception immediately and pay, saying otherwise they give the room away. I barely could move at that time. When I was finally at the reception to pay, they told me they don’t accept credit cards. They made me to go back to my room, get cash and come back. They could have been nicer and more flexible.;2
Great location i Hammersmith.  Rooms are clean and it has all the amenities,  however, it doesn’t feel like a usual hostel your sort of just told your room number an have to work everything else out yourself there is no signage or anything. Its also very noisy.  The common shower room is shared by both men an woman which i find a bit awkward but all an all it is ok.;3
Well my stay at abercorn house was eventful if anything , on trying to get to sleep i discovered my room mate ( a six foot snoring twot ) could not be awakened . well after two hours of hurling objects of different size and weight at his offensive smelling prone body , i did what any drunk man would do , put in my headphones and listened to AC DC how quickly i nodded off to be awakened to the large chap next to me asking how could i sleep through that , my retort was colourful to say the least , so  💩💩💩 on the fulham we were robbed ,COME ON BORO;4
When I first checked in the receptionist just dumped the key on the desk & said the number - not very pleasant at all! Ended up in a room of 4 beds by myself when I had booked a single room & was ensured I wouldn't get anyone else in the room, which luckily I didn't. The room was basic, single bunk beds that remind me of being a child, a small table, wardrobe & fridge (which was a pretty good thing to have). However, on hotels.com my reservation said in the room there would be a shower (although shared toilet) but in fact everything was shared and they do not offer rooms with a shower & shared toilet so don't be swayed by that!   The hostels location is great, 5 min walk from Hammersmith tube (zone 2) but unless you are looking for a cheap budget place to stay for a night or 2 I;3
Absolute rubbish. Stayed in a single room for a night and could not close an eye whole night. Noise, noise, noise. Doors banging all night, people partying in the garden untill late hours. Very rude staff. No TV in the room, no free WI-FI. Not a single positive thing about my stay. Look elsewhere regardless of price.;1
So I came on Monday morning around 9:45 am and i was told i can check in only after 12.  And despite so many people checking out they couldn’t get a bed ready for me.  Even aftr waiting for more than 2 hours.  Horrible mistake booking this place.;1
We wasnt expecting a fridge in our room but it came in great handy for storing drinks and some breakfast foods. We would of liked a map of the hotel floor or some more information at check in regarding the amenities to use. We had to figure out where the toilets/shower/kitchen were by wondering around our floor. The hotel is in a great location, 2 minutes walk from Hammersmith tube. Plenty of food places near by and we having a tesco in the tube station was handy. We didnt have our room cleaned which we didnt expect on a 2 night stay. All in all we would stay here again.;3
Spent a couple of night with a friend, and came to this house wich is well placed (near Hammersmith underground station) and is cheap. Well, it's cheap, for sure. We had a two beds room (with a fridge), toilets and shower were in the commons. All is old and rustic, almost spartiat. The only way to get fresh water is to go to toilets (even in the kitchen there is only hot water). Not too annoying at a first glance as we were just here to sleep. And here started the problems. No blind, and the shade can't really block the sunlight right on the bed at 5:00 am. No soundproofing, meaning EACH noise in the corridor is well-eard in the room : slapped doors, voices, radio alarms, etc. We were awaken each morning around 6:00 am, even with ear protections. The hotel can't be charged for;2
I stayed for three nights with my teenage son and found it a really good base. It is very close to the tube station and local shops. The rooms were basic but clean and our twin room had a fridge in it which was really useful. There were also plates bowls mugs and cutlery in the room. The room was clean. The showers were warm and clean. As has been mentioned on here the staff weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude either. I thought the hostel was excellent value for money.;4
When you reached here, remember to have British pounds in hand as they only accept payment in cash in pounds, no card or other currency payment accepted. Luckily, there is an exchange currency shop in Hammersmith station, I quickly went over there or else I could not check in or stay at hotel.  For a cheap stay like this in London, recommed for budget travels as this hotel provides basic things: a bed to sleep, a shared bathroom, a shared toilet (mixed male/female), a shared kitchen. They also have TV room and free luggage-kept room.  The location is extremely convenient: about 5 minutes walk from hotel to Hammersmith station and easily-connected to main station like Victoria or city center links. Food, drinks and supermarkets can be found right at the station or on the streets.;3
Am here now. I can't fault this place. It is a hostel not a hotel but that has many positives as well as  obviously not as luxurious as a four star hotel but then it's at least half the price. I found it very clean the facilities superb nice lounge and green area to sit. Well equipped kitchen and showers. Not sure what all the complaints about staff are about were friendly enough and once you have your key what else is there?? I would stay here again if in the area over a hotel as I like the relaxed and international feel of the place.;5
We are currently staying here as it was reasonably close to Olympia where we are volunteering for the beer festival.  The staff have been helpful, not overly friendly but they have dealt with all enquiries efficiently. The room we have is small but clean and serves the purpose. Good location for tube and getting around London.  You need to ask for a hairdryer and put a £5 deposit down which you get back when you return it which is fair enough. Room was cheap for London so no complaints so far.;4
I booked a double en suite room on the 1st May 2017 with Agoda.com. On my confirmation it stated I would pay at the Hostel, little did I know that Abercorn took my payment two days later on the 3rd May 2017. I don't always check my statements! But to top it off, when I arrived they never had my room so they had to accommodate me in a ground floor basement studio flat in Bayswater. They did transport me there in a Cab, Admittedly this was furnished to a high standard but I wasn't supplied with not even a glass,plate knife or fork even though it had a microwave & cooker. So the moral of the story is even though you have paid it doesn't mean your going to get to stay where you wanted to.;1
The manager of this hotel has a bad attitude, unhelpful, and dam right rude. We stayed for a total of 5 nights from the 20th of July, two twin rooms for myself and my work colleagues. The rooms are filthy, dated and in need of a total refurbishment. Staff need training on their customer service skills and the manger should reconsider his vocation as working with the general public obviously offends him.;1
Nice place.Clean and bright. There is a shared kitchen and mini shop. You have a shower and a fridge.The room is dry and has a window. It is 2 min from Hammerthmit bus station and tube. You have a 24 hour reception.;4
We stayed here on Saturday 8th July 2017 for 1 night for 2 reasons. 1- To see U2 at Twickenham and 2- to run the british 10k on the Sunday In terms of location its literally a couple of mins walk from the Tube station. Anyone wanting to go to Twickenham, access is easy via the tube/ train Its literally a few mins from Hammersmith Apollo and a walk into Hammersmith is about a minute if you want to go shopping. The hostel itself is very clean, we had a good nights sleep. The staff were not really very welcoming, but all in all, i enjoyed it, it did a job and i would recommend and would stay again.;4
We stayed here for 1 night on Sat 1st July 2017.  We had a private twin room with access to share showers / toilets / kitchen area.  Room - contained 2 full size single beds (very comfy and clean) with a single  bedside table between them. Large wardrobe, desk/dresser with chair, fridge and selection of plates and cutlery. Also provided with 2 towels in the room.  Room was very clean - had large window which opened fully - we were on 2nd floor so no worries about anyone getting in through the window.  Toilets / showers - all clean, quiet, plenty of toilet paper and soap - no towels  Kitchen - we only used to get water but again looked clean and well equipped but no pots/pans/utensils provided.  Communal areas - all clean and tidy no issues  Staff - all fine not overly friendly;4
Overall this room was good value. We had a twin room that consisted of 2 beds, wardrobe, and private bathroom. The room was clean, basic and in good condition. Staff were OK, customer service wasn't amazing but not terrible either. The location is great. Really close to the train station and plenty good spots to eat locally. I would definitely stay here again.;5
So I have stayed here a few times. its good because its cheap, close to the lots of venues, friendly staff, decent wifi, kitchen facilities, close to shops etc. beds are comfy. i recommend this place for travellers, or if you are going to the Olympia for an event. its good if your planning on sightseeing around London . only negatives is that it is cheap, there is shared facilities, you pay for wifi however its only a pound for an hour. overall great place;5
This is the hostel I usually stay in when in London. When I first stayed here maybe 5-6 years ago, it had recently been renovated and was the best and cheapest hostel (better than all budget hotels too) in London. Now it's starting to need a new renovation, especially the private bathrooms. Still better than most hostels though.   But they have nice, comfy beds and all linen and towels included. And an in-room fridge which is really good since they don't have breakfast. And they have no full carpets ☺️ (which I find disgusting to have in a hotel) And there has been something new every time I get there (the reception area has been changed, a café is added and has been expanded, and so on). I just wish they had 3-beds rooms as we are usually 3 friends going.   It's just a couple;3
DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE - booked a 2 night stay and paid in full in advance.  Unable to use the first night as delayed with travelling, phoned and advised the hostel.  Arrived on Saturday at 11pm exhausted only to learn that room had been re-sold and was full.  The room had been paid for in ADVANCE... at 3am offered a disgusting room, a bed that had been slept in and sheets not changed, pants and socks in the bed already!!!!! NASTY - JUST NASTY - Not even worth the 1 star, sadly you can't post without it!!!   Oh and lots of comings and goings with single men and multiple different women - make of that what you will;1
"I was attending world travel market and although I need to be close to the market place but unfortunately all acceptable hotels where fully booked so I decided to accommodate in Abercrombie house , I booked dbl room with my colleague mate , it's lovely place ,3 min walking from main hammersmith station , staff very helpful , rooms very clean and 5 min walking from primark mall , I went the primark in Oxford street "" main one"" but I thanked God that I have mine 5 min walking from abercone , also it's 25 min from Heathrow airport . On the end of street Starbucks cafe you can have your breakfast easily and all what you need surrounded in the area and away from noise and it's not that far away from main tourism district  I'm delighted to book at it with very nice price compare to";4
We stayed in a small 2 person room for 5 night. We were very happy with the hostel, it was clean and the service was always friendly. The wifi cost extra- that's why I will not give excellent rating. Location was perfect! Subway was a 4min walk away, the broadway had all the shops and cafes one might need, and the Westfields shopping centre is a 15min walk away! Tube to central London was 15mins too. Will go again!;4
We knew it wouldn't be luxury but we just wanted a bed to sleep in - we weren't going to spend our time in the room. We had booked a double room with shared toilet/shower facilities. The room itself was ok and equipped with a fridge. The bed was not good - the buttons in the mattress poked into our backs and legs. To get a hot shower you need to get up REALLY early or late in the evening. It was really difficult to get a good nights sleep because of people slamming the doors and as there are tile floors everywhere sound travels really easy.;1
First off the location is great being close to the underground and close to the Olympia Exhibition Hall which is where I needed to be for the two days.  Staff were not very polite.  Room very basic with uncomfortable bed and loud at night times.   Shower rooms very dirty and not kept up together very well.  All in all I would not stay again, even for the low price I paid.;2
"I had a private room for two persons with shared shower and toilet on the corridor (all were clean; unfortunately not all showers had hooks for clothes). The room was basic and clean (expect for some stains on the wall). The beds were ok and a towel was provided. There was a small table with chair, a cupboard with a mirror and a medium sized fridge. Also for each person there was a plate and crockery. Perfect to get some food from the many take away restaurants in the neighborhood or drink a beer after the bars are closed (almost after dinner in UK). The metro is on 5 minutes walk from the hostel. Especially it is a convenient if you want to see a match of QPR or Fullham or  a concert at the eventim arena. There is a Belushis bar which closes at 2:00 during weekends, so you do";3
I've stayed in many hostels in many different countries and have never been so disappointed. The room was not only bare bones, but there was no box spring on the bed- only two mattresses on top of one another. I wouldn't even complain about this if the mattress was at least comfortable, but instead, you would sink in wherever you laid down! The dirty mattress was covered by a flat sheet that wasn't sized correctly, so it often came undone. (No fitted sheet) This is not the type of mattress you would want to be touching without a sheet to act as a protective barrier.... although you found some comfort in having a sheet between you and the filthy mattress, the sheet provided was also not clean! We found several hairs on the sheets which did not belong to me or my boyfriend! There;1
From start to finish this place was pretty poor accommodation.  Positives:  - Good enough location if you intend on going to the Olympia Exhibition Hall as it's about a 20 minute leisurely walk.  - Within range of some nice places to eat and drink both low and slightly higher end.  - The floor looked clean enough   - Soap dispensers on the wall in the shower and by the sink.  - fridge in my room   - common areas reasonable clean  Negatives:  - I was volunteering at an event at the Olympia Hall and there was an social media group set up for us all to discuss various things. I happened upon a post that mentioned this accommodation and the fact that they had overbooked. and were turning people away or moving them over half an hour away to another hotel. Now, I realise this is;1
I travel to london every year and so I try to find cheap accomodation since the main reason for my travel is to roam around london and shopping. I bearly stay in my hotel room so finding cheap accomodation where I can just leave my bags and return at night to sleep is my goal. I stayed at Abercorn house around 4 times both with my friends and with my mum. Don't except much, it is only the best accomodatin if your aim is to have cheap accomodatinon, could leave your belongings somewhere and to sleep.;3
there was a live baby cockroach in my bed & this was the noisiest hostel i've eve stayed in, world wide. when i told the front desk about the cockroach, they offered to clean the room or transfer me to another room. i just couldn't stay there, though. instead, i left the hostel and was told to ask the manager about a refund. i tried for days to contact him, 2 staff members guaranteeing that he'd take my call or email me back, which, to date, he has not. it's been over three weeks. DO NOT STAY HERE unless you like bugs and noise;1
I've been to many hostels during my studies so I knew what to expect from an hostel. Of course you don't get comfort and all the strings attached but at least hostels are a great opportunity for socialising (and saving money). Well this hostel is not. The common rooms are non existent. Kitchens too small. We didn't socialise with a single person in 5 days.   Furthermore the bathrooms and showers were very cold (and shared with at least 40 people per floor).   At night there is a mess you can hear every single door of your flat slamming open and closed.  Rooms are too small, especially the four bed room, enough for 1 or 2 days but not for more.  Wi-Fi is supposed to be paid extra 5 pounds for only  5 hours of connection per week.  Staff is really really rude and they don't do;1
We stayed at this hostel for NYE in London. It's a 5 minute walk from Hammersmith station so thats a good thing. It's basically the only good thing this hostel offers. The floors are sticky, the walls are dirty and the toilets won't all flush that good.   Service is also not that great. When we bought a travel adapter they all did not work and because there was only one guy at the check in desk we had to grab it in the shop ourself en take it to the desk.   All in all, a fair price for this mediocre place.;1
We stayed here for two nights when we visited London to watch a show at the Apollo. The location was superb! Short walk to venue/underground and bus services. We stayed in a twin room with shared bathroom and even though our room was opposite the kitchen, noise wasn't an issue. At the end of the day this is a hostel, not a suite in the Hilton! The room was clean and modern and the shared toilet and shower facilities were also clean and tidy and we're visibly cleaned every morning. Check in/out was quick and painless and the price was the best we could find in the Hammersmith area for the days we were staying. Would deffo stay here again when attending another event. The main and only let down is the charged wifi as £1 an hour is pretty steep! I understand it's a big building and;4
Firstly when we arrived to check in we were advised the card machine wasn't working so we had to go find and take out cash, very inconvenient and impractical. Next we were shown to our room with a private bathroom which we got but the room was located next to the reception area and across the narrow hall the kitchen, so an ideal place to guarantee lots of noise and little chance of sleep due to the very noisy guest and rude staff.  Next the sheets on the 'double bed' (two singles which hadn't been zipped up) were dirty and full of hair....see attached pic. Upon requesting they be changed the receptionist asked me why? Isn't it obvious that we want clean sheets to sleep on? So eventually we got some cleaner sheets but still didn't feel 100% clean and comfortable. Only saving;1
Booked to stay four nights as a pair. First off we were expected to pay in full on arrival prior to viewing the room. On pulling back the bed sheets we found pubic hair and nail clippings. The floors were sticky throughout and with hygiene standards well below par we returned to the reception to request a refund. The staff were extremely rude, dishonest and unhelpful. Several attempts were made to contact any kind of manager, we were given a time to return the following day but were met with the excuse that the manager was in fact out of the country. Exhausted and disheartened we accepted a 2 night refund, despite never actually staying.  We were visiting my sister in london and with our accommodation budget only partly returned we were left to couch surf for the entirety of the;1
no idea why so many bad reviews on this place. its by far the best hostel ive stayed in so far room was modern clean and spacious had no problem sleeping and didn't find the hostel or the area noisy at all;4
I had a double ensuite & paid £53.00 & expected from a hostel it was very basic but was very clean, there were cups, plates & cutlery provided in the room, plus towels. There was a wardrobe & a fridge in the room. There were plenty of kitchens on each floor & a little shop in the foyer that sold hot & cold drinks plus various types of food from sandwiches to ready meals etc to heat up in the kitchens. I never used the communal kitchens or bathrooms so can't comment on them. The bed was comfortable, the room warm & surprisingly quiet. If you want a cheap basic room in London then it's worth looking at. If you like the comforts & luxuries of a hotel then this place may not be for you.;4
Stayed in room one week beginning 31st October. Staff very rude. Accidentally left something in the room which seems to have disappeared now!!  Called hotel & was asked to call back later, 6 phone calls later & my property has not been found.  I have no been blocked from leaving reviews via Booking.com!!;1
The staff members at the reception are simply disrespectful, ignorant and grumpy the whole time. If you need any help, you bett find solutions on your own.  Not only that it's noisy in the morning (slamming doors, construction area next to the building, thin walls), the Wifi costs extra (very rare in hotels(hostels).  The rooms are poorly decorated, no TV, no table lamps) and the beds are uncomfortabe since they are too soft to sleep properly.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend visiting this place, cause there are far more comfortable places for this prize!;1
"- The service (both reception and cleaners) do not speak good english and are rude. - Rooms are so noisy; doors make a lot of noise when closing and there is a lot of people in the corridors, as well as people walking. No soundproof at all. There was also noise from outside because there is a building site under construction in the same street. - There is nothing to hang your clothes while having a shower. - WiFi is not free; they charge you if you want to use WiFi. + The hostel is 2min walking from Hammersmith Tube & Bus Station. + There is a minimarket with food in the reception with really good prizes.";2
The mattress had a hole in the middle and I was unable to sleep. Besides that the noise from the people, the doors etc was unstoppable especially during the night. The tiny room is like jail with a small window.  The stuff wasn't polite. If you want a place to sleep during the night, like a normal person, this is not the right one. If you are vampire this is it!!;1
If you want to sleep in this hostel you must wear ear plugs or you must be deaf. They are trying to keep it clean the common areas but  the cleaning stuff was extremely rude. Definitely I don't recommend it;1
Location is a gem. Only 3 minutes walk from the underground and bus stations, shops and cafes. 15 minutes underground ride to Piccadilly. Staff unfriendly, no welcome whatsoever. Wifi 1£ for 1hour. We have stayed in 2 beds room, with refrigerator, plates, cups, forks, knives and spoons. Kitchen and facilities are shared-lots of kitchens (with microwave, toaster and coffee machine) on each floor but not all of them had working devices. They do clean every day, change bed lining every second day. Also, the walls are very thin so it can be very loud in the night.  Hostel is cheaper than some in the same range  and I would say 'good value for the money' but it's just not - staff should be much nicer, and it is only cheap because things are old or broken, and of poor quality.;2
Location is it biggest advantage. About 5 minutes walk from Hammersmith underground. Comfortable beds and clean linens. They clean the place everyday. The only downside is that they kitchen does not have any utensils for cooking. Also, as I found in London, there is a more than decent chance that there might be dicey guests in the hostel. So a bit of luck is required for a good night's sleep.   Overall great value for money.;4
Ok the floors were clean...that's the only good thing...had a double room more like a cupboard..tiny on suite bathroom...no kettle so i had to buy one as i didn't want to keep tracking to the kitchen...which only had a cooker fridge and kettle in it no utensils...no TV in room good job i had my tablet with me £1 an hour for internet...no breakfast....hot room...i definatly would never EVER stay here again...not even if you paid me....;1
I can give only five stars for this place, It was really comfortable, clean and tidy. The Hammersmith underground station is a 2 minutes walk from the hostel and you can find restaurants, shopping malls and bars around this place. I highly recommend this place for everyone who needs quiet and silence.;5
I stayed in a private twin room with my sister when we traveled to London for a shopping trip last November. The location is great, it's very near the bus and tube stop going to central London, although we even walked twice! Yes, it takes about 40 minutes but it's a nice work-out :) I was surprised how clean and newly refurbished the place was, I didn't expect that from a hostel! The only downside was our room was right opposite the shared bathroom and the door was really noisy.;4
REGRETTABLE, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYTHING.  I had a reservation for four nights, but I got sick the previous day and I couldn`t take my flight.  I canceled the reservation and send medical evidence, but still they refused to refund me the amount of any of the four nights.  DE PENA, NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA. Tenía una reserva para cuatro noches, pero enfermé el día anterior y no pude tomar el vuelo.  Cancelé la reserva, pero aún así se negaron a devolverme el importe de ninguna de las cuatro noches.;1
I was staying in London for 6 nights this time and all of them were spent here. If you are looking for more privacy I would suggest you paying a single room (like what I did). The price was fair for its location, its strategic I would say as it's a stone throw away from the tube station and a vibrant shopping centre providing most essential one may need. The sound insulation was a bit tough as I was a light sleeper, the constant walking in and out of people or cleaning etc awakened me frequently. However will still recommend it to budget traveller!;4
Was exactly what we needed, booked very last minute (an hour before we went and checked in) and had a private double room. Shared bathrooms were cubicles which were kept very clean and being open 24hours allowed us to come back late after our family function without a worry. Always someone on reception who were helpful and a bonus little tuck shop in the reception where we were able to get water and some dry food after our night out (they also have easy ready meals there like pizza and curry). Location was brilliant for us, 2 minute walk from Hammersmith tube station and checkout time perfect at 11.;5
When we checked in at 3.00pm the room wasn't ready and the floor was wet.  Unhelpful & Rude Staff -The Housekeeping were shooting at each other at  8AM in the morning and people slamming doors through out the night. The noise kept us awake all night until we finally couldn't take anymore, dressed and went and complained and the receptionists were not helping at all, very rude and ignorant!  DON'T waste your time and money-AVOID!!;1
Good  location for  a  first  time  in London.  The room  was  clean  and  tidy.  The welcoming  was  quiet  cold  and  unfriendly.  We enjoyed  our  stay  there even if we barely spent time  there apart  from  sleeping. ..;3
I took a room with my boy and I can say...really not bad! Even if it was Just for one night , we even did a shower and find an aazing woman who gave us shampoo and stuff :) comprare to other hostels  where I ve been its a.good.one;3
"Me and my sister stayed at Abercorn House for a few days. We were really surprised at how nice it was considering how ""cheap"" it was. Our room was simple and small but we had really comfortable beds and everything was clean. The shower wasn't the best but it didn't matter. The location is really really good. You can get zone 2 tube tickets and easily get into London city in about 15 minutes. It's so easy and Hammersmith itself is beautiful too. There are plenty options to buy food and drinks.  the only reason to rate only four stars is because we had some difficulties paying and the walls are very thin so it feels like strangers are literally next to you.  Anyway we loved our stay there and would recommend it to anyone searching for a simple stay close to London City.";4
