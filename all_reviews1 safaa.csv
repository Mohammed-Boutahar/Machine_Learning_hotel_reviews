We had a lovely stay here for 2 nights. Excellent location, the Hotel was absolutely perfect. The staff where top class, a special mention for Gabi, she very kindly gave us some Prosecco when she found out it was our Wedding anniversary, very kind and the kind of service you'd expect in a 5 star hotel.  The breakfast was amazing, great value for money and everything was perfect. The room was also spotless, quiet and very comfortable, we always use Premier Inn these days as you can pretty much guarantee that everything will be great. Keep up the good work, you have become leaders in the Hotel sector;5
We had been given a present for afternoon tea for 2 at the ritz and decided to make it a two night stay in London. We only live 8 miles away but I felt like I was on holiday in another city as I have never done the London sightseeing before.  The hotel is literally a 2 minute walk to the London eye, we travelled up by train to Waterloo station and it's about a 5 or 6 minute walk from there. The staff who greeted us were very friendly and professional and we booked the dinner/breakfast deal for one night and morning. We went to our room on the 6th floor (premier plus room) and we were delighted how fresh and modern it felt, a really lovely bathroom with shower only, coffee machine, fridge, ironing board/iron and the view was looking directly at the London eye. The only criticism;5
The Premier Inn at Country Hall was the perfect base for our weekend away in London. The hotel is situated on the South Bank next to the river Thames. It‚Äôs also next to the London Eye and a very pleasant walk along the river to London Bridge. The hotel staff were incredibly friendly. The room was ideal. Spotlessly clean, well deigned and equipped. Exactly what you would expect from a Premier Inn. The breakfast was excellent. Plenty of hot and cold food in a very pleasant dinning room. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again next time we visit London.;5
Great location, lovely friendly staff , great price for central London , our room was very large double, I was very happy with the room , breakfast was just ok but lots of choice, would definitely recommend this hotel and am sure we will stay again .;4
Lovely hotel, fantastic service and friendly staff, clean rooms, super comfy beds, USB charger in room, breakfast had great choices and well cooked, fair price, Wi-Fi good, Great location, close to main attractions,;4
A fantastic historic building in an iconic location close to public transport and walking distance to everywhere including lots of great food.   Friendly, knowledgeable, flexible, and attentive staff took this from a great experience to an exceptional one.   They will even hold your bags after check out while you get your day sorted!  (Thanks!)   Our best stay in London.  10/10!;5
Receptionists very kind and friendly. Nice bed in the my room. Breakfast staff really hard workers. It was a bit noisy in the evening but overall it was ok. I recommend this hotel. Price and quality.;5
Thank you for a lovely stay. Hotel clean and well maintained. Excellently situated for central London, and sightseeing. Just a short walk from the Houses of Parliament. Staff very helpful and friendly. But I must give a special mention to Yasodara. A member of staff in the breakfast dining room. A very attentive and friendly member of staff. A really asset I‚Äôm sure to the  Premier Inn, London County Hall team.;5
Overall I chose premier inn because of its price and location. It was on the cheaper side of hotels I could find that were around popular landmarks. I also liked that it had a restaurant onsite for nights that you didn‚Äôt want to leave your hotel to eat.;3
Fantastic location near the London Eye and Westminster, large rooms, great value food and drink. Love this hotel , stayed many times. Staff very welcoming, perfectly clean, safe and ideal as a base for sightseeing;5
Really good location close to tube, national rail and bus links also great for walking to Londons iconic sights. staff were friendly and the check in was quick. Room was nice with comfy bed and good facilities. Would really recommend this hotel;5
Just a short walk from Waterloo underground, the Premier Inn County Hall is an ideal base for visiting numerous sites, theatres, etc. within a half hour walk across the Waterloo footbridge and along the South Bank. The hotel is spacious and the welcome friendly.  The restaurant was well priced for central London and the beds were, of course, very comfortable so we slept well.;5
Vastly overpriced.  A basic premier inn with a premium price.  No phone in room. No hairdryer.  Breakfast was mayhem. The cheaper premier inn waterloo uses this one for breakfast resulting in chaos.  Food substandard.  Pictures show lovely fluffy pancakes what you get is dry cold pancakes probably cooked day before.  Tables full of dirty plates.  Trully awful.  Paid ¬£569 for 3 nights.  Half that amount would still be too much.  Grubby room.  Avoid this place only thing going for it is location;1
Hotel is located on prime location. Prices are always economical sometime even cheapest if book in adavces. Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Breakfast is full of varieties and worth agaist money value;5
Stayed here with my wife for a 50th Birthday weekend and got a free drink in the room when I told them about our birthday celebrations which was a nice touch. Everything from the friendly reception staff to the quality of the breakfast and efficiency of the waiting staff was excellent.Would stop again when next in London.Good location for sightseeing.;5
Another wonderful stay at Premier Inn County Hall for my Husband's 60th birthday. Great location, friendly staff, clean spacious room. Very accommodating, after paying ¬£10 early check in fee we were giving access to our room at 8:30 am. Thank you Premier Inn;5
I had a lovely stay with you guys, just wanted to say I was having drinks at the bar and I was served by a young lady named Zuzanna, she was very lovely and very welcoming she also was very polite and made me enjoy my time even more thank you üòä;5
Each time in premier inn for the location ‚Ä¶ the room is clean and nice and the bed is amazing ‚Ä¶the friendly staff‚Ä¶ the restaurant is good and we eat later ‚Ä¶ thank you kristine and miriam ( restaurant) for your smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüé°üá¨üáß thank you premier inn;5
Super location, large room with 2 double beds in, very clean . Very handy for the undergound at Waterloo, which has many line coming in and out. Frances on reception was very helpful and friendly. We would definately stay here again .;5
Great location, comfortable rooms, decent food. Shame that towels are not checked daily to see if they need changing, and tea and coffee facilities are minimal. Given the price, I'd expect a bit more, even of a Premier Inn.;4
Nice hotel, single glazing so really cold at night even with the heat set at 25¬∞ maybe extra blankets in the winter months is an idea? Our room was extremely large in size it could easily fit 3 double beds with room to spare +/- 40m2 our ooms in the past in different hotels were around 12m2 The meal deal option made our trip budget friendly. Location is awesome! Right behind the London Eye. 5 minute walk across the Thames to several theatres. Big Ben and the houses of Parliament also a 5 minute walk. Extremely close to the Tube (Waterloo) would book again.;5
Absolutely amazing! The location was perfect and the room wow I have no words, it exceeded all expectations. Normally when I book a twin room we get a double/king bed and a single sofa bed where at this hotel we got two massive double/king beds which made our stay much more enjoyable as we got an amazing nights sleep. The staff were all friendly as always and nothing was to much trouble we ate in the restaurant and the food and service were both excellent. I will definitely be booking this hotel for my future London stays.;5
The location of this hotel is great! 2 underground stations which can be reached easily. The staff are extremely friendly and make check in and check out so simple! The room was spacious and clean. Will definitely come back!;5
A weekend visit to explore London and take in a west end show. Easy check in with staff readily available. Room was spacious with great view and was very quiet. Room clean and well equipped with multiple usb ports available for charging. Meal deal offers great value for breakfast and two course evening meal with drinks. Will return;5
Great location, just next to the London eye, lovely room and brilliant breakfast, the staff were very friendly would definitely stay again at this particular hotel. It‚Äôs location is excellent for exploring London.;5
We have stayed at this hotel several times. The staff are always very friendly and very helpful. Its in a great location just by the London Eye, 20 min walk to Covent Garden area. Will definitely come back.;5
Check in was easy, room was perfect, we had a meal in the evening before heading to the theatre, plenty of choice, and was delicious and hot, hotel is in perfect position to walk up in to the west end, hotel was full  but there was no issues with noise during the night, Breakfast was perfect. Hotel is within walking distance from Waterloo station and very close to London eye, shrek , London dungeons and the London aquarium  Will definitely be back;5
We have been very impressed with this Premier Inn. The family rooms are spacious, clean and quiet. The location is excellent. A 20 minute to Covent Garden and next to the Uber Clippers boat stop which we enjoyed. The breakfast is good and there is a playground next door to the hotel which was a lovely bonus, not to mention the iconic views across the river. We would stay here again. Finally, the staff were very friendly and helpful.;4
Excellent location. Easy to check in at reception. Very spacious room. Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast. Lovely food in the restaurant. Taxi rank nearby. Attractions within walking distance from the premier inn. Would definitely return in the future.;5
We have just returned from a 3 night stay at premier Inn, county hall and what a visit it was! Location of this hotel is absolutely awesome for sightseeing. Right next door to London eye, sealife and dungeons and a stone's throw from Big Ben, HIP and Westminster abbey.  The staff were extremely friendly and we had a fabulous breakfast each morning to set ourselves up for busy days! We did have a meal in the restaurant on the first night, and it was ok (nothing wrong with it, but didn't eat there again)  Breakfast was busy between 9-9:30 so if you can avoid these times This hotel also do a early check in and late check out for ¬£10 each, which we did take advantage of so we could make the most of our trip without worrying about luggage.  Westminster is the nearest underground;5
I've stayed in the County Hall several times and have never been disappointed. The location is great the only disappointment is they are going to out price themselves. It is getting so expensive. I think Premier Inn should introduce a loyalty discount.;4
Excellent stay again at a Premier Inn.  The room was clean, exceptionally quiet for central London, well located and staff were very helpful and friendly.  We stay in a lot of premier inns and can always rely on this brand for consistency.  Thanks for the discretionary upgrade, though the rooms are very much on parr with one another.   Thank you.;5
We do like staying at this hotel. Lovely staff, clean rooms. Anything extra needed always happy to assist. However only 2 coffee sachets and 4 milks, then you have go back down for more. After a long journey slightly annoying.  Also two people in room and only one bath towel and hand towel, had to go down and request more whilst partner was in shower.  Staff very happy to help, but would be nice to get to room have a coffee and relax not have to keep popping to reception.;4
Worst cleaning experience in Premier Inn. You have to request a clean I consider this a basic of a hotel stay. 1st day bathroom not cleaned. 2nd day room not cleaned at all despite requests at 10.30 and reception did not resolve. Had to request clean towels. Stay was Comfortable and quiet Excellent location on Southbank beside London Eye. 4mins from Waterloo Tube and station. M&S food beside hotel. Good Restaurants on Southbank close to hotel.;3
Fairly small room but great en suite, lovely comfy bed and not stuffy like a lot of hotels. Very quiet, good location, breakfast good value for ¬£10. Friendly staff.  We‚Äôve stayed on here numerous occasions and always enjoyed it. Great a few nights in town.;5
Top staff, very helpful. Helped any way they could. Easily Accessible from the Elizabeth line. Good location, nice room, clean. Didn't try the restaurant as there's plenty of choice around there. Overall, very nice experience. Would use again;5
Lovely comfortable beds, excellent central location on the south bank, near Waterloo for east underground.  Good breakfast and lovely staff, quiet and temperature controlled rooms  Very good value, we would definitely stay here again for our next visit;5
We've just returned from a fantastic stay at this hotel. It was right outside the attractions we were visiting (London Eye, Shrek Adventure, Aquarium) so perfectly located.   We were able to check in a couple of hours early for a ¬£10 fee and before that could leave our luggage securely whilst we explored. The check in staff, and every staff member we spoke to actually, we're incredibly polite and helpful at all times.   The room was much bigger than other Premier Inns we've stayed in and spotlessly clean. Despite being a large hotel and in an incredibly busy area it was very quiet and we couldn't hear any noise from other rooms or from outside.  I'd very happily stay here again and would recommend.;5
No complaints from us.  The hotel was very easy to find and took 4 minutes to walk to from Waterloo underground.  The hotel is very conveniently located, so we managed to walk to everywhere we had planned to visit.  We arrived at 12pm and stored our luggage and then on returning at 3pm we collected the room key.  All of the staff we encountered- from reception, to bar to cleaners in the loft, ALL of them acknowledged and made conversation with us. It was a really nice experience and environment to be in.  We had breakfast too, we‚Äôre seated promptly & food was plentiful and tasted great.  I would really recommend the hotel and have no criticisms;5
The hotel situation is unbeatable. It is a clean, quiet hotel, the staff is very friendly. The breakfast is very complete and free for children under 12 years old. I will repeat. The temperature inside the room is very good, the beds are very comfortable. Also, for London the room is very spacious.;4
Lovely hotel friendly staff. Lovely food and good Service. Been twice now and will be back. Very warm room and our children loved it. Very clean, tidy and well maintained. Thank you to all your staff for a lovely time for my family and myself.;5
This was our second stay at this hotel and I can‚Äôt fault it. Great location and price for our family room. The staff were lovely and overall it was a good midweek break. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Clean and safe and we hope to come back for our next London trip.;5
Amazing location!  Right beside the London Eye.  So handy for all the tourist attractions as you‚Äôre either walking distance or you‚Äôre a short stroll to a train or underground station.   We had a partial view of the Eye and the rooms itself was spotless and modern.  Staff friendly.  Dinner was great.  Breakfast good, busy if you go at peak times though.  Will definitely return!;5
Recently stayed for a short family break. All staff, from the reception to the restaurant, were extremely helpful. Big thank you to Angeli and staff in the restaurant for lovely service. Food was amazing and really good value for money. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Great location aswell! Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anybody looking for a good hotel in London.;5
Fantastic service from the restaurant staff, particularly the shift leader in the black blazer. Food was absolutely delicious too. The pizza and the sweet potato and spinach curry were amazing. Room really spacious for the night, reception staff great on arrival too.;5
To be honest, we originally wanted to book into the Mercure, but they seemed to have priced themselves too high now. So we booked into Premier Inn ‚ÄúOh well it‚Äôs a bed‚Äù   On arrival, we were greeted with very friendly staff and an early check in option ( which we took). Room was clean and amenities were very good. After going the theatre in the afternoon and finding dining in theatre land was going to be nightmarish we decided to try the premier inn restaurant. Well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. It was fantastic!! Our waitress said ‚Äúas you‚Äôve booked your morning breakfast with us, you can have 2 courses off the menu and a drink for ¬£16.29 each!!!!! ‚Ä¶..what?!!!!! What a bargain! Staff were so attractive and friendly I was moved to speaking to the manager as to how great they all were.  So‚Ä¶ thank you premier;4
Perfect location for going to see lion king! A little walk down to Waterloo bridge and over that and you‚Äôre there! Lots to see along the walk so went fast!  Hotel staff were helpful and friendly and lovely and clean. Would recommend if wanting central London, great value for money and breakfast was amazing! Highly recommend!;5
Perfectly located next to the London Eye and within easy walking distance of most of the theatres and shopping districts. Room spacious, clean and tidy, staff welcoming, breakfast second to none! The bonus is being able to leave suitcases at the hotel pre check in and again after check out, thus being able to roam the city bag free. The staff were all friendly and welcoming giving the impression that they like working there. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay there again in the future.;5
We‚Äôve just had a super trip to London aided by staying at the Premier Inn county hall on the South Bank. We requested a room with a view and we were very pleased to be given a room that looked out over the south bank and the London eye. Our stay was very comfortable, the hotel was clean, it had good amenities and the staff were lovely and very helpful. Breakfast was very organised and the cooked breakfast was very good. We will definitely stay again, the hotel was ideally situated to go sightseeing in London.;5
Rooms were comfy and well laid out. Breakfasts were good, staff very friendly. Didn't have to wait long for anything. The location was great for what l wanted for myself and my granddaughters. Accessible to under ground also. Would definately go back.;5
We stayed to this hotel for 2 nights and everything was fantastic‚Ä¶ All the team was so welcoming and really professional‚Ä¶ We will definitely come back as now this hotel became our favourite one‚Ä¶ Thank you County Hall;5
From the moment you walk into this hotel the staff make you feel welcome and a pleasure to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Took advantage of the early check in for an additional ¬£10. The room was and bathroom was spotlessly clean and the bed as usual very comfortable. The room on the 3rd floor 365 was noisy in the early morning as it faces the indoor courtyard and deliveries and dumpsters are evident with the noise. Breakfast was a more than ample with plenty of choice for everyone. Gails bakery just around the corner is worth a visit for a light lunch or hot drink. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Westminster or Waterloo tube stations and within minutes your are in the heart of theatre land, the Chinatown and Covent Garden. Would recommend and would be top;5
Comfortable rooms with plenty of space. Excellent buffet breakfast and friendly staff. Ideally situated for all the best bits of London. Surprisingly quiet at night which was a pleasant surprise. Would definitely stay here again when next in London.;5
Would like to say what a professional happy helpful the coloured girl was on the front desk on Saturday around 1230 hrs sorry can‚Äôt remember her name but she was very helpful and professional many thanks;5
Give credit when it‚Äôs due. Great location, very good room, staff especially in restaurant very friendly. Overall a lovely stay for a decent price in London.  Clean and very little noise bearing in mind location. Food at evening meal was good. Thanks Premier Inn;5
Great location for walk to Theatre Land if you are fully mobile. Clean and comfortable room. But bed and pillows very hard so didn't sleep well.  Breakfast areas were clean and good choice of hot and cold options. But chilled fruit / berries etc were still frozen. Good to have non diary milks available though.;3
Fantastic location, very clean rooms eoth everything you need, all staff very attentive and made you feel welcome from the word go, didnt eat here butwe had some drinks which were very reasonably priced compared to out and about. Cannot fault and would 100% stay here again;5
Was billed upfront rather than on arrival as my booking indicated. This caused an issue as my colleague was from our Irish office in Ireland and had a different Expense route so I had to put through as one as the UK which was not ideal.;3
I liked the Hotel, very pleasant staff and nice hotelroom. The breakfast was a bit Meh, at least the continental breakfast. The room was alot more spacious than I first thought, and for the location it was very affordable for a 4 night stay!;4
From the moment we arrived, everything was fantastic. The check in with Abrim was amazingly smooth and he made us feel very welcome. This is where the amazing service started and it just continued from there.  The location was perfect for what we wanted to do. Visiting from Australia, we wanted something centrally located with easy access to everything that we wanted to show our kids. Right at the London eye just across the bridge from Big Ben, Parliament and Westminster Abbey, this was the perfect base for us to explore. A 5 minute walk from the tube and 15 minute walk to Covent Garden, everything is at Premiere Inn County Hall's doorstep.  There are some reviews that mention noise from construction, etc, however, we didn't experience any of this. I can only imagine that the;5
Rooms were very clean and extremely comfortable and the location was great, right next to the London eye so close to Westminster and Charring Cross bridge. All staff were friendly, helpful and  professional, they couldn‚Äôt have done more.;5
Great Location for sight seeing. Rooms as to be expected. Breakfast was average but good selection. Heating failed the first night but ok the second night. Beds comfortable  and staff friendly. Would visit again due to location;3
The hotel was situated next to the London Eye on the river Thames. Waterloo tube station within a 5 min walk. Westminster sites within a 10 min walk. Really good Premier Inn. Excellent breakfast. Not as cheap as some premier Inns but a fabulous location for London.;5
Welcomed by Angelie, what a lovely lady!  It was my husbands birthday and she made our stay really special.  All the staff are excellent, the room was super clean, breakfast was plentiful and great quality.  We have stayed in London many times but this has to be the best,  The location is excellent, the staff are so helpful and obviously enjoy their jobs.  We are already planning next years birthday break. Well done Premier Inn, your staff are a credit to you.;5
What a great location for a London city break. We booked a premier plus room and it was definitely worth it. In both rooms we had issues with the shower which we reported but nothing was done about it. That was the only negative, everything else about this hotel was spot on!;5
"Would definitely stay at this hotel again, close to underground station and South Bank. Located in adjacent building to County Hall to see Witness for the Prosecution. Added feature; USB plugs on either side of the double bed.";5
Although it‚Äôs described as County Hall, there was no real connection with the old County Hall. The hotel is actually at the back, so there are no river views from the hotel. For Premier Inn it is relatively expensive, but the location is excellent. 10 minutes walk to Waterloo Station, with all its connections. The rooms are very well appointed and quiet.;4
I frequently stay in Premier Inns but this was my first time at County Hall and I was really impressed. Customer service was exceptional. Every single member of staff was super-friendly, efficient and professional.  Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Soundproofing was excellent - we literally didn't hear a sound all night, despite being right on the South Bank and the hotel being quite busy.   On top of all that, location is excellent. Walking distance to many sights, right on the bus routes and close to Waterloo, Charing Cross and Westminster stations. Lovely Italian restaurant 'Locale' just a few doors down. Will definitely be booking there again.;5
Great location for London and the sights. The hotel staff were helpful and the room was very clean and well maintained, we did not eat in the hotel however reasonable prices and it looked OK. Recommend a stay for business or a quick visit to London.;4
What a perfectly positioned hotel. Very clean and comfortable rooms. Breakfast and evening meal great value for money. The staff were so friendly and helpful nothing was too much bother for them. I would highly recommend this hotel for a reasonably priced stay for business or leisure. Can‚Äôt wait to stay  there again.;5
Stayed four nights on business. Excellent location a short walk from Waterloo mainline and tube and plenty of places to eat on the Southbank. It‚Äôs a big hotel, so I did wonder if there might be a lot of noise from guests coming and going at all hours, but I didn‚Äôt hear any noise. Bedroom was a good size, with a comfy bed. Bathroom was always cold and the water in the sink never really got hot, although temperature of the shower was okay. Standard Premier Inn breakfast and lots of staff about if one had any questions. I may well use this as a base next time I go to London in my own time.;4
The staff were brilliant but there was a bit of a queue at times in the reception. The location was  perfect and the rooms were clean. The price was decent. There was a good view of the London eye. The room was spacious. Would definitely go there again.;5
Excellent location by London Eye. Easy for sightseeing, shopping and theatres.Reliable clean rooms and friendly staff. We stay in Premier inns as you know what you are getting. If its just a comfortable clean room with everything you need and a good breakfast.Most are in very good locations.;5
We stayed at county hall premier Inn for my daughter birthday with my friend and her daughter. We loved the location for all the attractions and local bus stop that went all over we didn't feel lost trying to find places.The hotel was more than what we expected to the staff very helpful and the food we enjoyed for quality and value for money, we were very happy with our stay and will be returning again the room was big enough for us. Great value for money.;5
What more could you want. Perfect location  Great breakfast  Big clean room  Nice view  Lovely staff   On holiday in my favourite city, 1 minute walk from hotel to the most amazing view of the city and the sites. I love this place, I love this city. Would highly recommend!;5
The perfect location. Choice of tubes within five minute walk. Westminster over the bridge. London Eye next door. Simply couldn't pick a better location. Prices you won't find anywhere else in central London and the Premier Plus rooms are excellent.   Fantastic service, breakfast lovely too. Will definitely be back;5
Great hotel, in the perfect location. Everything is 10 minutes away. Price is incomparable in central london. 100% staying again. The tube is spitting distance and all the breakfast was suprinsingly elaborate!;5
Often fully booked, we were happy to get into this hotel in January 2023. The old County Hall is such a fantastic building and very well situated, a few minutes travel from the West End. The ‚Äòplus‚Äô rooms are large, well equipped and very comfortable.;5
Room (booked a premier plus very small for two people for 4 nights )  Cleanliness of room and restaurant  Service slow  Food and bar slow service .at least 25 /30 mins wait on courses  . not all options available ..  no gluten free options  cold hot food ‚Ä¶  broken coffee machines  wrong orders and then waited for correct meal  Long wait for food and service at reception  Wifi service awful and didn‚Äôt work  Fan didn‚Äôt work  Noise from outside in room  Cigarette smoke and butts in reception stairs and person smoking in main doors  Bed linen stained and ripped  Dust on lamps and sides  No hand soap in room  Not enough towels  Some Staff were rude;2
Extremely disappointed and surprised to see a member of staff leave a toilet cubicle then leave the toilet without washing his hands and go immediately to the check in where he checked us in and handed us our key cards. A big -10 for personal hygiene, will be complaining to the management.ü§¨;1
Everything about the hotel was great room, breakfast and all staff so friendly The breakfast was amazing and such good value  Room clean and comfortable  The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you and were so pleased to help  Location was absolutely fantastic;5
The hotel is at great location, just next to London Eye and Waterloo Underground station. Clean Hotel , huge restaurant and value for money breakfast and variety of food. Rooms were refurbished and beautiful and Spacious Rooms. Always request the rooms on 6th Floor and book for Premier Plus Rooms. Reception Staff is always available and very helpful 24 hours. Bed was queen size which is not suitable for 2 persons. They must replace with King Size. No Weighing scale in the hotel. Charged 10 Pounds for early check in just before 1 hour which is not worth. Groceries are nearby and short walk to waterloo main station. Hotel is secured with key , nobody can enter hotel or floors without a key. Room clean must be requested at the reception and sometime cleaning staff do not clean;5
Excellent location near main attractions. Just a short walk across Waterloo Bridge to the theatres and Covent Garden. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the shower was lovely. I would recommend to others and would definitely stay here again.;5
This hotel is amazing value for the location on the Southbank right by Westminster bridge and the London Eye.  The family room was massive so plenty of room for the extra beds. The main bed was very comfy and we slept well.  With Premier Inn you know what you are getting and the family rooms always have 2 decent extra beds for kids who don't want to share.;5
An excellent Hotel to stay in. Location was perfect for us. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent, however people were queuing from all angles. We would recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family.;5
I would highly recommend this hotel to those visiting London. Pros: Functional room Amazing location Quiet Comfortable Food available  Cons: The bathroom was small and could get very wet when showering  Very large hotel- for better or worse;5
A perfect, reasonably priced hotel for being right in the centre of touristy London. We saw frozen the musical, easy distance from convent garden/west end. Lots to do in the local area. Really beautiful building. Couldn‚Äôt be happier.;5
Love Premier Inns but not this one. In a nutshell apparently a few times a month (see other reviews and external source confirmed this) illegal car/bike gatherings are held right on their doorstep. Woke us all in the middle of the night- it was horrendously loud and echoed/ reverb up all the buildings.  The hotel obviously have no control over but deny these are regular (I found 6 other reviews on here confirming this and their refusal to compensate), even the Police are aware and attended. So if you want to play sleep roulette stay here and because it‚Äôs outside the hotel itself they refuse,  albeit politely to give you the good night guarantee refund.;2
Great Hotel in a great location just behind the London Eye, super close to the Thames and a pleasant short walk to The Southbank, Hayward Gallery and Tate Modern. Was perfectly located for our trip to The Old Vic, which was just a ten minute walk away. Very reasonably priced parking nearby, made this location very convenient.;5
We booked premier plus room on floor 5 . Room was big , very comfortable bed , lovely hot shower , very clean and a great location , would happily stay again .   Rooms are not serviced each day but if you need fresh towels etc just ask reception night before and they‚Äôll inform room keeping .;4
We had the worst steay ever. So much noise . People nockin on the door when I open there was no one there. The staff was not nice. The bed was uncomfortable my wife woke up whit a bad back. No where to park.;1
I highly recommend Premier Inn County Hall.  The staff are friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble.  The food was delicious and very good value.  The bedroom had recently been refurbished to the highest standard.  It was a most enjoyable stay and my thanks go to the staff for their dedication, patience and hard work to make guests comfortable over the Christmas period.;5
If I could rate this hotel‚Äôs restaurant as zero I would. We waited for over an hour for food,listening to the family at the table behind us complain that their food was cold on delivery. When ours eventually arrived my husband‚Äôs chips were cold, steak overdone. The worst was our daughter has food allergies and the food wasn‚Äôt cooked correctly. We queried her meal with 2 members of staff who said they would check but of course they didn‚Äôt . We were absolutely disgusted with the standard of service and care and we certainly weren‚Äôt the only Customers who felt the same. My son in law has a business account with this chain and will not be using them again;1
Stayed two nights for NYE fireworks with my fianc√©e. Located right next to London eye. Lovely hotel. Very clean, lovely staff. Beautiful room. Loved the breakfast.  Only downside was every morning was woke up with I think it was the bins getting emptied.  But did not spoil the stay.  Would recommend. Mins from Waterloo station underground. Not far on tube to most iconic sites.;5
My wife and I would like to thank Raluca and her team for making our stay at premier inn London County Hall, from the 30th December 2022 to 2nd January 2023. We celebrated my birthday and nye within our stay.   I can imagine that this was the busiest time of the year for Raluca and her team, and they all managed to be there for us to make our stay the best.   We have stayed in a lot of Premier Inn hotels up and down the Country, this been one of the best!  Raluca and her team gave 110% and are a credit to Premier Inn.  We will be returning to celebrate again at the end of 2023 with family.;5
The Premier Inn is a great for budget family rooms and this one was the best we've stayed in.  The room was newly refurbished and very clean. We had a great night sleep. The staff were all very welcoming both at reception and in the restaurant. Breakfast was delicious and kids ate free which is a bonus.  Couldn't of asked for anything better. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in London with children.;5
Very pleased with this stay. The biggest plus is the location - really central for everything. The room was very well maintained, clean and comfortable and the staff really pleasant and helpful.  Breakfast room was packed, but they handled this really well and the food didn‚Äôt suffer from having to feed so many.;4
This was our second visit to this hotel and we came down for my wife's birthday and to spend New Years Eve in London watching the fireworks.   This hotel is great, clean, friendly service (especially Daniel and the team on reception). All extremly helpful and can't do enough for you.   Location is ideal and our family room was fantastic.   Totally recommend this hotel.;5
We booked this premier inn last minute after a horrible experience at another hotel we booked.   The staff were so friendly and helpful, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great location as well which was so handy. This hotel was very well staffed and was very clean.;5
We stayed for two nights. All very good. Food okay and rooms good enough. The only small issue was the lifts. We tried the stairs but the sign says they are alarmed. A bit confusing. But this only a small issue in a good stay.;5
"Spotlessly clean room, tasty well priced food (with the meal deal) & friendly staff all make this our ""go to"" hotel in London. Excellent value for money & if you are fortunate enough to be greeted at reception by ""Frances"" then you will experience the best & most attentive service you could wish for. Thanks to everyone for another fantastic stay, we'll see you again in April.";5
A family stay for four nights and this premier inn was ideally suited. The breakfast was well managed and always a good choice with so many people each morning, rooms very good size and as usual excellent beds. If you wanted a room clean it needed to be requested or you could get clean towels from room attendant. Close by some excellent eating places and good shops, good bar with realistic prices.;5
Great location. Staff friendly and helpful. Had a meal in the evening, which was very nice. Also had breakfast. Very busy. Go early or later. Plenty of availability of food and drinks. Good value for money in London. Evening drinks in lounge a let down due to queues, as not enough staff on duty. Other than this a good stat and would go back;4
This hotel has it all. Great location and Central to everywhere around Westminster. A real gem! Staff were nice and the hotel rooms were a decent size and spacious. We would lived to visit again.  However, the hotel bar is abysmal. Beer was awful Sandi's tried almost everything on tap. Very disappointing as we had a child with us so were limited as to where we could go. Staff weren't trained properly and the manager of the bar couldn't care less it seemed. Not good. I'd go somewhere else for a drink if possible.;5
Staff are quite simple and hard work to communicate with. 1st night our bathroom stunk of weed as we‚Äôve arrived back on the night. Found it bizarre that we had to ask for our room to get cleaned when we was stopping more than one night and then come back to our room still not clean but we give the cleaner time in the end what‚Äôs not a problem. Don‚Äôt understand why the cleaner who gave us one towel to share when there was two of us. Overall I wouldn‚Äôt stay at this premier inn ever again and definitely better hotels around and better price.;3
We had a great overnight stay in an amazing location for the theatre, London Eye, Parliament Square, the tube and Waterloo (if the trains had been running).  Car parking very close by. The staff at the hotel were friendly and the breakfast was plentiful and enjoyable;5
This review is just for the breakfast buffeet which we visited twice during the second half of December. Kids up to 15 get to eat free with parents. For my family of 4, the buffet came out around ¬£21 for us. The buffet includes decent English breakfast items, pastries, cereals and drinks (latte, coffee to juices). Overall, it is a great value comparing to other options. The location is right by London Eye and the south shoreline. The Waterloo tube station is nearby.;3
Perfect location, the staff been nothing but amazing especially Alejandra, she accommodated us beautifully and her amazing sense of humour! The rooms are amazingly spacious and everything was phenomenal! Visiting again for sure;5
We found the hotel clean, staff friendly, rooms clean, all bedding & towels white. Coffee & tea making facilities. The hotel was the quietest that we have found to date in London.  Next to the London Eye, across the bridge from the Strand. Taxi‚Äôs very often available from outside the eye, or use the hotel telephone to book directly with a taxi with fixed fee! Throughly enjoyable, we will return.;5
We had a fantastic stay at the hotel's Premier Plus room on the top floor. It was very comfortable and quiet. We were very pleased with our experience. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. We are planning to come back to stay next year.;5
Perfect location, the room quite clean and well maintained. Excellent service, very friendly reception and restaurant team. I will definitely repeat and recommend it. You can walk to the main streets and monuments of London. The underground very close.;5
Hotels very busy at Xmas but great service , great location right next to London eye and walking distance to a lot of major London tourist spots. Great choice breakfast, great value. Would definitely stay here again on future trips to London;5
Lovely hotel right by The London Eye, madam Tusuards, Shrek, London Dungeon and many other attractions, friendly staff rooms comfortable food was great, very busy hotel but well organised would definitely stay there again.;4
We stayed here as a pre Christmas treat, it was well situated for the theatres, south bank centre, London eye and lots of the museums. They were having issues at check in and our room wasn‚Äôt ready even though it was after 4.30pm, but the staff worked hard to resolve this and gave us complimentary breakfast for our stay. The cleaning staff seemed desperate for us to be out of the room on the day we left well before check out time, but the reception staff were very apologetic and offered to escalate our complaint, but we didn‚Äôt pursue it as we‚Äôd been very happy with our stay. Every where was very clean and well lit, the restaurant staff were amazing with my allergy and although the room was basic it was clean, in good repair and very quiet. We‚Äôll stay here again.;4
Just came to London to meet up with family, see the lights and go to the theatre, so just a one night stay. Very convenient, comfortable and reasonably priced compared to our usual hotel in the Strand. Good accommodation and great breakfast.;5
We‚Äôve stayed here a couple of times and always had an excellent stay. The location is super convenient for Waterloo station, numerous buses and the London eye. The staff are always very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast is great value too. We will be back!;5
I stayed at the County Hall for 4 nights whilst my husband was at St Thomas‚Äôs hospital.  From start to finish it was a great stay.  The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.  The location of the hotel is perfect for Westminster which is a 5 min walk and has a tube station.  The building is also in front of the London eye.  The breakfast and dinner was very good and my room was lovely.  I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend this hotel.;5
Lovely clean room, friendly and welcoming. lovely restful sleep the only downside was the bin men at 7am (can‚Äôt be helped as they have to do their job) however they seemed to take forever the crashing of glass and the bins being tipped was so loud but apart from that lovely hotel!;5
clean nice designet and comfrtable rooms exlenet locatoin, close to tube and bus stations very good breakfast a friendly staff a vew of a part of the London eye from the window a selction of restaurants and bars around the hotel;5
1st time for everything I suppose, stayed here on numerous occasions and have generally turned up earlier than the 3pm check in and never been a problem. We turned up at 13.20pm and the room was ready but we would need to pay an extra ¬£10 early check in fee on top of the ¬£240 it had already cost for 1 night in this hotel I'd already paid. I said no we'd get a drink and come back later, we returned about 14.20 and there still trying to charge an extra ¬£10 early check in. My point is the room is ready it's cost ¬£240 for 1 night, we literally want to off load our bags and be on our way for our meal and show booked in the evening. What do they think they would be losing by letting us in 40mins earlier than 3pm, as it happens we decided to boycott our traditional couple of drinks at;1
"We had a room facing into the inner courtyard and at around 6am there was a lot of noise coming from here. Men shouting, banging and crashing (could hear beer kegs being moved around). This woke us up and I use ear plugs. As we checked out we said this to the reception staff and they were very dismissive and said it was nothing to do with them. We asked about the good night's sleep guarantee and she said as it wasn't their fault and it was the morning (d therefore not the night) the guarantee doesn't apply. She was very defensive and borderline aggressive. The one thing she said was ""you should have asked for a quiet room when you checked in, we have some quiet rooms"". We are not the sort of people to complain and have never left a negative review of a hotel but we feel we have";2
Pros: Premier Plus room as expected, large, very clean and comfortable with a great walk in rain shower.   Cons: Arrived on the coldest day of the year and the check-in queue was down the street. Took around 30 minutes standing in freezing temperatures before getting into the building itself. Only one self check in machine open and one other staff member checking in. Really need more.  Hotel up steps with no step free access so a struggle with a heavy suitcase. Hotel entrance, lobby area and corridors very shabby and not very clean. Same with lifts. Strange smell in corridors, certainly not usual level of Premier Inn clean. Very noisy during first and last nights with children running up and down on floor above at 2am. Eventually stopped when an adult yelled!  Last night, woken;3
Checked in early and paid the ¬£10 extra. Room was very cold 442. Went off to the matinee having left the heating on to get the room warm. Came back room still cold - noticed at this point that the only windows were in the corridor area to the bathroom. Opened curtains to find men outside working on the scaffolding and absolutely no view! Off to early dinner in restaurant - dirty wine glass. Coffee served before dessert ???? We had a meal deal ( handed in the voucher!) they tried to charge us for the whole meal not just coffee. We had heard other people having the same conversation about being charged twice. Back to room - still cold! Out to meet friends leaving heating on - got back room still not warm . There was no heating at all in the bathroom  Or corridor to it. Decided to;1
The hotel is right under the London Eye, close to most of London city attractions. Were able to walk to the theatre, to the museums and other attractions. 2 minutes walk to Waterloo tube ad train stations for getting to sites further away;4
I just returned from a five-day stay at the Premier Inn in London County Hall, and it was fantastic. The room was outstanding, the staff was wonderful, and the breakfast was amazing. I also took advantage of a meal deal on the last night, which included three courses and a drink for each of us for the price of two. The hotel is located on the south bank, close to the London Eye and other nearby attractions.;4
We have stayed here a few times now and it is always comfortable with adjustable heating and great beds.  The breakfast is very good with plenty of choice.  The staff are very welcoming, friendly and pleasant,;5
I enjoyed joyed a weekend getaway in London with my son and the hotel was the perfect location to base ourselves. Clean, quiet and not too much cash. I'm amazed at the location: we could see across London and the London Eye was just outside our window. Thoroughly recommended.;5
Pros: lovely staff throughout hotel and bar/restaurant.  Comfy Bed as always with a PI. Plentiful supplies of hot water for showers etc.  Tea and coffee on hand in room.  Food in restaurant is fine the salmon was generous and cooked to perfection.  My husband enjoyed a curry and the mixed grill.  However, it takes ages to get served and then ages again for food to arrive.  Not the fault of the staff, they are a small team to cover both bar and restaurant and there are simply not enough of them! Fabulous location for tourist attractions and easy to get taxis etc to travel further afield.  The London Eye, Southbank and parks looked very festive with all the lights.  It felt very christmassy.  We also did the dungeons experience (also in county hall) and it was fabulous fun!  So;3
I‚Äôve stayed at the Premier Inn County Hall about 10 times in the past 4 years and it never disappoints. I love everything about it - the location, price, rooms, friendliness of the staff and the great breakfast menu. Even when I‚Äôm visiting on my own I feel safe to take the short work from Waterloo Station at any time of day. You can‚Äôt get more central than overlooking the London Eye. Highly recommended.;5
I've never been disappointed at the County Hall Premier Inn,  always clean, friendly, and perfect location.  Love it. We were on the 2nd floor which was immaculate.  Our room had obviously been refurbished fairly recently as it was very new.  Super clean ensuite and lovely crisp white bedding on our comfy bed. I couldn't ask for more in the centre of London. Perfect location for our trip.;5
County Hall is a great base for a stay in London. Covent Garden,theatreland, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Regent Street and much more are within walking distance. County Hall Premier Inn is comfortable and affordable and you know exactly what you are getting. Highly recommend!;5
Regular user of Premier Inn, and never once been disappointed. Needed an emergency stay in London as we had missed our last train home. Very reasonably price, infact really good value for money in London. Warmly welcomed in the wee small hours. And as always, dark, dark room, lovely bed and bed linen, perfect nights sleep.;5
Overall, it was a great base for exploring London. The room was clean, and breakfast was fantastic value. At check-in, I was using the automated system and following the instructions when a staff member snatched the room card out my hand and continued to finish off the process, I didn't ask for help nor did I need it. The room was also I bit chilly. We'd been out at Christmas markets all day and were cold to start off with and just couldn't make the room warm up.;4
Amazing location. Premier Plus room worth the extra cash. Very clean. Reasonably quiet. Friendly housekeeping staff. But sadly check-in was chaotic. Self serve machines were not working properly. Staff had to break off half way through check-in to do other things. Two separate queuesfor the manned check-in meant that 3 parties arriving after me were checked in first simply because the person serving them was quicker. Needs more organization / signage.;4
What a gem of a find. Part of the county hall building next to the London Eye. Amazing. We had a view of the London Eye from our room. Stunning. Fabulous location and it was buzzing with atmosphere. The rooms were great as always. Breakfast was very good indeed. A busy hotel as it was near Christmas but the staff were so polite and very hard working. The lady on reception upon our arrival was so efficient and personable. Bar prices were expensive but it is to be expected in London. A lovely service from start to end. We will be back.;5
Great location for anyone to who wants a central location and not have to use the tube. I went with my family and the 4 of is manage to walk to alot of places from here. Lovely wall at night to soak in the Christmas atmosphere.;5
What a great location  also a Great welcome, great rooms, bed was so comfortable and room was quiet. Temperature was spot on all night and lifts were frequent. Breakfast queue was 5 mins at 9am and we‚Äôll worth the wait.;5
Greatest size room especially for London!!!  It was warm and cozy for winter. Gorjuss comfortable bed and pillows and fairly quiet. Have stayed before and would recommend and stay again for definite. Just needed some drawers and 1 extra towel but the housekeeper did give us one ‚ò∫Ô∏è lovely kind helpful staff. Thanks for a great stay;5
Stayed here with my sister for 2 days. Wonderful location. Welcoming friendly and helpful both on reception and in the restaurant. Westminster underground station about 5 minutes walk. Recently refurbished so everywhere was clean and fresh. Our room was on the fourth floor.;5
Booked Saturday to Monday then the train strikes were announced so booked the Friday as an extra booking. Daniel on reception sorted it so that we kept the same room for our stay even though the Friday was done as a separate booking. All the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The room was spot on and had everything we needed. We ate in the restaurant on 3 nights and found the menu to be varied and the portions very filling. It's priced very competitively and there is quite a good selection of wines. A special mention must go to Adi our server. She made sure everything was to our liking and always found us a nice place to sit. We had breakfast each morning which will definitely set you up for the day. The hotels location is perfect, right next to the London;5
We selected this hotel for price and location - we also went for the b&b deal - we did not regret any of the choices - we had a family room 2x2 - 2 single beds for the kids - very comfortable and plenty of room around the beds. The breakfast had great choices and the self service coffee machines, I thought, were brilliant - great coffee. The staff were always smiling, helpful and courteous. The hotel is also in a great location - less than 5 min walk to either waterloo or Westminster station. South bank with the london eye is just outside the door and we were 10mins walk to Convent Garden and that general area. If ever in London again will check here first!!!;5
Stayed here for 3 nights in a twin bedded room - one double and one king size!  Bedrooms are large, very modern, very clean and very comfortable!  Bathroom with bath and over bath shower - no heated towel rail or extractor fan though.  Room not cleaned unless requested but didn't bother us.  Staff very friendly, polite and professional - nothing too much trouble.  Meal deal was very good value - ¬£53 for two of us for two course meal with glass of wine or beer and full breakfast menu!  Lovely food, lovely restaurant.;4
The London County Hall Hotel is in the perfect location for exploring London. Just across from Waterloo station. Round the corner from Big Ben and in front of the London eye. The hotel staff gave us a warm welcome and the hotel was clean and comfortable.;5
We chose this hotel for the superb location as very handy for everything we wanted to do in London. It did not disapppoint as excellent for Thames Rockets and Thames Clipper boats as well as walkable to most places (West End, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, etc). The room was fairly basic but was very spacious and had everything we needed and so quiet considering the very central location. We appreciated the luggage storage facility before and after check-in times as that enabled us to squeeze in a bit of extra sightseeing on our arrival and departure days. We booked the dinner and breakfast deal for ¬£26.99 per person which was great value and great food. Our young waitress at dinner was a credit to the hotel and looked after us well. We had expected a fridge in our room which we;4
All was done as expected.  There was a slight downside of waiting quite a long time in a queue to check in as there were only two check-in desks available.  The room was an improvement on other Premier Inn sites as there was a shower cubicle instead of a bath and a fridge in the room.;5
"Very enjoyable and comfortable stay in Central London. Right next door  to London County Hall where ""Wotness for the Prosecution"" is playing. Westminster Underground is just over the bridge 5 mins away.";5
Lovely room with a view and lovely location . Really Enjoyed ourselves and a lot of restaurants nearby to eat too which was convenient for us .   Service was great  and staff were helpful  and friendly;4
I've used Premier Inns for business for many years - probably 6/8 times a year - and found them fair and basic ie good value for room.  Recently, they have added a new way of ripping off customers - a ¬£10 early check-in  charge.  When I arrived at around 1.30pm I was told that the room was ready but I'd have to pay ¬£10 to access it 1 and a half hours early!  I didn't pay but at 3pm, the queue to check-in ran out of the lobby and into the street!  Checking my emails it is mentioned in the small print of the confirmation email received a day out but, having used the firm for so long, I don't bother to read it.  As a change of terms, it should have been highlighted.  No-one expects an early check-in, but if the room is ready, it is usually give. In these difficult times, shame on;1
Hotel and  staff fine, hotel location excellent however  as a business traveler i tried to check in 35 mins before the 3pm check in time and the hotel wanted ¬£10- i refused to pay- i accept if a room is not ready and  thats not a problem but to try and charge ¬£10 for early access  ( 35 mins) is just annoying and would seem to be PI's  way of  making  additional money on a room, perhaps in future and given check out  is 12pm  and i  normally vacate early  i should insist that PI don't access the room before 12pm to clean unless they agree to give me ¬£10 for letting them have that  early access-. More annoying when i returned to CI @3pm i had to queue  for 25 mins given the number of people now checking -in - it was ridiculous;3
A reasonably comfortable stay, chosen mainly for location,(I am a veteran in my 80th year & was attending the Cenotaph parade). Food was, in the main, good, particularly the breakfasts. Staff were friendly & attentive. Only gripe was the cost for one person, ¬£94 1st night, ¬£225 2nd night.;4
Spent two nights here 5-7 October. Excellent location right by the river Thames, London eye and mainline station waterloo.  Rooms as you would expect from premier inn, comfy, clean but no frills. Didn‚Äôt eat at hotel as so many other choices nearby. For a perfectly nice stay in the heart of London that won‚Äôt break the bank I‚Äôd highly recommend.;5
We enjoyed one night at this h√¥tel for the first Time.  ++ great location Great employ√©e ++++ a cot for our baby If i come back to London i will sleep in a premier inn hotel i think because that was great;5
Had a lovely overnight stay at the Premier Inn County Hall.  I upgraded to a Premium room and was very impressed with the size of the room, the size and comfort of the bed and the facilities.  I felt that the price was very reasonable and felt that based on the above this hotel offered excellent value for money.  I always use this hotel when staying in London and I am back again in January.;5
"Great location, good quality.   But breakfast was cool 2 days out of 3. Its as if the pass lights were not used.   Also quite a bit of ""building"" noise early morning - more noticeable as we like to sleep with tht window open";4
Arrived on Friday at 2:15pm and paid a extra ¬£10 to check in early, got to our room on the 4th floor and we was looking out at a huge amount of scaffolding in place, asked reception to change rooms as we just paid ¬£438 for 2 nights, was given another room on 2nd floor, we booked a double room for 2 adults, we was given 1 towel and there was no water to hand! No phone to call reception, I called of my mobile to be told rooms on floor 2-4 don‚Äôt get water or extra towels etc. I complained to management but didn‚Äôt get anywhere, will take this further, for spending out nearly ¬£500 I expect to at least have a bottle of water in the room!!! Will NOT be staying here again! Asked for room to be cleaned and all was replaced was 1 towel! Rubbish/bins wasn‚Äôt emptied;2
Stayed 1 night for Remembrance weekend (2 adults). Clean room and comfy bed. Considering location, very quiet. Staff were exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable.  Bar was comfy and good range of drinks. We ate breakfast in the hotel but didn't eat any  other meals there.  Could have done with more than 2 sachets of coffee on the hospitality tray though.  Were asked at check in if we wanted breakfast & if we wanted to book a timeslot & table. Got there at right time but still had to queue & be led to a table. No problem, but not sure why we were asked if we wanted to book timeslot in that case. Waited for hubby back at hotel, after already checking out.  Staff were very helpful and considerate.;5
A nice hotel, clean, small room but comfy beds, we had a shower and bath in our room which was good, great location and very handy for train station. Whilst great choice at breakfast it could be organised a bit better.;4
Away with group of girl friends to a show in County Hall.  This hotel was chosen for the location, price and consistency of the Premier Inn standard. Very friendly team, we were able to drop off luggage before check in and leave after check out for the day.   Very handy as close to Waterloo Station.;4
Soul-less hotel, a good location but that is all. We had to queue for check-in (despite there being two desks, only 1 was manned). Our room was large but had the smallest window, meaning we had to have the light on in the day. We were woken multiple times during the night by outside noise.  Breakfast was chaotic and quantity over quality.  We were double charged at the bar for drinks (staff members mistake) and despite the transactions showing on our account (on our bank‚Äôs app) we were told to return the next day to prove that we had actually been charged! We‚Äôve stayed at many Premier Inns over the years and always found them very good but next time we return to London, we‚Äôll stay anywhere but the Premier Inn County Hall!;2
We stayed at the hotel on Friday evening 18th November for 1 night. I chose this hotel for the location close to the London eye as we knew we would be going on this the next day along with a river cruise. The staff we dealt with were very friendly and let us store our luggage both days which was fab. The room was basic but clean and warm. Breakfast absolutely fantastic! We chose to eat on the Friday night for ease but I must say this wasn‚Äôt too good, it took abs age and was cold/not fantastic quality. But the breakfast was superb!! I defo would stay here again just wouldn‚Äôt have dinner. Wish we‚Äôd of known there is fish and chips round the other side! Or there is an all bar one and slug lettuce right round the corner. Value for money was great;5
Close to the Festivsl Hall & the London Eye,. Clean, quiet room at the back. Sunny day, so had a lovely time strolling & taking photos. Slightly spoilt by rude staff & abrupt Manager on 12/112022(the morning after our 1 night stay)  The staff member did not admit her mistake or apologise for getting our paid breakfast wrong/instead said we must've given her the wrong room number. We had not! Refund given by a very abrupt female Manager, who needs to be trained to speak more politely to paying guests!!;4
What a superb stay we had. 2 friends on a mission to enjoy South London - excellently placed, huge rooms, lovely bathrooms and the breakfasts were AMAZING!. Now then - for the staff - Premier, you need to look after all your staff - they were truly superb, welcoming, helpful, willing to go above and beyond in all departments. I would like to say - I wanted to leave a tip to be shared across all the staff - there was no opportunity to do this - so maybe, look at this in the future as its important they know they are truly valued. Thank you all, highly recommended.;5
Recently refurbished rooms at Premier Inn County Hall were great for family trip to London. Modern shower bathroom and very comfortable bed and excellent breakfast. Great location for easy access to fab attractions including London Eye and Thames river boats.;5
The facilities and location were perfect for a family visit to London and reasonably priced. Easy walking distance to sites and transportation. Staff was exceptional, especially Alejandra for her hospitality and kindness to my kid. Highly recommend.;5
We stayed at County Hall to be able to be close to attractions we had booked. Sadly, the weather was not great, but the room was comfortable and we were able to take our time sorting out alternative things to do. We had arrived early, but the room was ready and we could check in early without fuss. As always the breakfast was filling- just a shame pain au raisins appear to have been taken off of the pastries menu.;4
Check in was disappointing as often understaffed with a large queue as busy weekend.  Room was clean and tidy, however due to building noise outside it was often hot in room as unable to open window due to noise. Bar and restaurant was disappointing due to poor under trained staff.;2
"Planned to stay 2 nights in London to be able to sing a ""scratch"" Messiah in the R.A.H. [also fitting in 2 shows, 3 exhibitions and the service at the Cenotaph].You can always rely on Premier Inn to be in the right location, to have consistent standards without breaking the bank.";5
"Have stayed here before - like the location. Booked a premier room as a special occasion. Checked in, went to theatre. Slept OK. Next morning shower didn't work at all. Reported to manager when got to reception. Tried to fob us off with ""why didn't you check it when you arrived"" ! Only response was to give a us a customer (non) services number - engaged. Email response was 25% refund, repeated by the supervisor. Just forget their ""guarantee"" of a good night  - never again.";2
This is my second visit to this Premier Inn. It is situated perfectly, only a few minutes walk to Parliament Square ant many Landmarks, right in front of the London Eye. Welcoming and efficient staff, The rooms are comfortable and clean, nothing fancy, but just right. It is a no frills hotel, which is just suits me fine, a great nights sleep, with a good shower, and despite it being a large hotel, very quiet. The breakfast is very good. I would have no hesitation in staying again.;5
Wow , c we went for the weekend and night 1 was at the county Hall and night 2 was at a 5* super expensive Hotel , the Premium Inn County Hall wins hands down for a beautiful room and a good nights sleep and wonderful reception staff, Thank you we will return;5
A great stay for a city break for a few nights.  Very convenient location. Quiet room even though quite close to the lifts and main corridor.  Clean and comfortable accommodation. Excellent breakfast.;4
Arrived 15 minutes before check in to avoid a que was asked to pay ¬£10 for early check in so declined and stood and waited. No where to sit in reception. Also to get to reciption with all our bags and a baby in a pram there was a big stair hair into the hotel. Didn‚Äôt see a ramp. I did ask and was told there wasn‚Äôt one. Luckily the hotel had a lift to get to the rooms! The room was modern, clean and very nice. The bath was VERY slippy, every room should have a bath mat in it. They turned off the hot water at 11am, check in was 12. They should have waited the extra hour. Breakfast finishes at 11am too so we had to wake up an hour earlier than planned. We had a busy day ahead and wanted to sleep. Breakfast was good! Great selection. Cleaning dining and pleasant surroundings. The;4
Paid the extra for Premier Plus room which was still a lot cheaper than the ‚ÄúBoutique‚Äù hotels around. We stayed here for proximity to Waterloo station (5 minute walk) - Only downside was the Premier Inn  ultimate Wi-Fi it constantly disconnected from devices which wasn‚Äôt too bad as we were only staying one night.;5
We stayed one night and were so impressed with this hotel, the location is perfection. Easy transfer from Paddington and then walking distance to so many attractions. The staff were so friendly and attentive, wish I had got the name of the guy on reception as he was exceptional ! Beds were comfy and a lovely big room for london !;5
County Hall Premier Inn is ideally located not far from many central London focal points and 5 minutes walk from Waterloo station. Its an attractive historic building from the outside, and a modern comfortable hotel inside. Very clean, bright, and welcoming, and probably one of the best Premier Inns we have stayed at. The room was a good size with all the conveniences  you would expect. Only two minor points neccesitate a score of 4 rather than 5 - firstly that there was no shower cubicle, just a shower over the bath. The shower itself was good, but its always a little awkward clambering in and out of a bath to use one. Does anyone really take a bath in a hotel room? Secondly - the public loo style toilet paper dispenser! Pretty rubbish, constantly struggling to get paper out;4
The hotel location is great. 5mins walk to Waterloo train station, less to the underground. M&S foodhall nearby (though they don't do meal deals). Beside London Eye, Londond Dungeon and other nearby attractions. It was lovely to walk along the Thames and Westminster/Big Ben is only across the bridge.   The check-in was straightforward, and they have a luggage room to leave luggage free of charge if you arrive before check in time and do not want to pay for an early check in, or leaving later than your check-out time.   The bedroom was roomier than other similar hotels, and the beds definitely better.   Breakfast was great with an ample choice of foods.    Our only complaints:  The basic WiFi is soo bad. I live in the countryside and get 3mb/s download speed. I assumed that even;4
This hotel is the perfect location for getting to see the sights around Westminster and Waterloo.  Staff are excellent although there was not enough of them but they still kept smiling. Downside is mobility scooter had to go into left in basement.  Not ideal;4
Great location on the South Bank for the theatre, galleries and shopping. Nice helpful staff. Reasonable breakfast and comfortable hotel to use as an overnight base. Issue with the room not being cleaned one day only partially resolved. Overall it was a good place to stay.;3
Great location, close to London Eye. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was great value for money. Good breakfast. Room was clean, quiet and comfortable. Fantastic stay, would recommend and will definitely be back.;5
Just had a lovely stay in County Hall Premier Inn-clean, really comfortable refurbished rooms. Staff very busy but really helpful, friendly. We had breakfast ,excellent value. Location perfect for sightseeing, couple of minutes from London Eye,Aquarium and Westminster . Good value for money, really can't think of any negatives.;5
Much more tired and aged than other Premier Inns stayed at. WiFi non existent and, from other reviews, has been an ongoing problem. Expect little to no WiFi. Had to get a new key every day as it stoped working. No attention to detail. Asked for a change of sheets mid way through a 4 night stay and too small a sheet was put on bed. Bed not as comfortable as other Premier Inn beds. Felt old. TV in room small and dated. Annoyingly was not working properly and, despite it being pointed out, never functioned properly for the whole time we stayed. Our room cost @¬£200/night. Absolutely NOT worth it. Even for the location. Would never come here again and we come to London a lot.;1
We always look to book the County Hall when visiting London, location is superb to get around and access to Waterloo station. Normally we are not that worried about having a standard room but because it was for just myself and my husband we upgraded to the new Premium room which was about ¬£20 more and also added the early check in from 12noon rather than 3pm.  This was our first time in the premium room and I was pleasantly surprised, the decor is very relaxing, great walk in shower, lovely upgraded bathroom products. The bed was super comfortable, some soft lighting and we loved the addition of the Nespresso coffee machine, and fridge. We never find any reason to complain about the county hall or Premier Inn as a whole as you know what you are getting and what to expect, so;5
Have stayed in plenty of Premier Inns over the years and they're all pretty good. The County Hall one is in a fairly old building and isn't as polished as some but it's in one of the best locations. It's right beside the London Eye and just across the river from the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey etc. Our room was clean and spacious. I don't know if we were just lucky but it was also incredibly quiet. We were there with our two kids. The breakfast bar was busy in the mornings but not uncomfortablly so. We enjoyed the breakfast, which is a great way to set yourself up for a busy day of sightseeing. We also had two evening meals there, where the food was simple and very cheap compared to nearby restaurants. What really impressed us though was the staff. They were ALL;5
Beautiful rooms nice views of London. Only downfall was a few noisy neighbors banging so got the kids later to bed than normal but that was the only downfall food was lovely such a big selection.  The room was very clean.;4
Perfect location just near the London Eye and the area feels very safe. We had a family room which was nice a big and brilliant value for money. Free breakfast for the kids even though they eat more than me! Nice clean, comfortable room. The only thing was the street outside was noisy. The window was noise-proof but the room was so hot that we had to have the window open.;5
The location is the biggest selling point. Its literally right behind the London Eye. We even had a view of the river (from the side).  The staff are fantastic too and there is a free left luggage facility for guests.  The breakfast has a good selection and the dining room is nice.  The family room was huge. Almost too big because it felt half empty of furniture but still a great size for a family. Cleanliness let them down. Uneaten chocolates on the floor, dirt in places. It felt clean enough to use, but just don't look too closely.  We had a few annoying issues here though. The bed was not the normal premier Inn bed. It was smaller and harder. It looked tiny against the large bed frame that's built for their normal size beds.  The mattress was firm and the pillows were so;3
We stayed in a Premier plus room, which was pretty impressive. Spacious, well planned and chic. Tv was a bit basic, but minor issue. Was concerned with confusing signage for fire escape arrangements when we were faced with a prolonged fire alarm. We ended up lost in the building...it wasn't clear where the exit to fresh air was and we ended up in staff areas in the Marriott Hotel, which shares the building!!;5
Recently refurbished room to a nice standard. A comfortable stay in a fabulous location, just minutes from the London Eye and tube station, lots of attentive staff at breakfast time where sometimes can cause problems, this hotel has it just right, they didn‚Äôt run out of food or crockery like other locations I have experienced.  Well run establishment and I would highly recommend.;5
Such a great stay. Room was immaculately clean bathroom was sparkling. Bed very comfortable slept so well.  Great location can walk to Westminster in minutes. 15 min walk to Leicester Square 20 to Covent Gdn, China town & Soho.  Waterloo subway station 5 mins away.  The staff were amazing so friendly and welcoming.  We had room 637 on the top floor was very quiet.  Amazing stay would definitely return.;5
We have just spent two nights at the Premier Inn, London Eye as a family.  The location is fantastic, right next to the London Eye which meant we were able to walk to most places that we wanted to visit. We had a huge family room which was immaculate.  It was great to have a bath and shower. Unfortunately my daughters didn't find the two single beds very comfortable but the double bed was very comfortable.   We all enjoyed the self-service breakfast.  Plenty of options if you are coeliac / gluten free.   What really made the stay special was the staff.  Everyone that we met was so kind and welcoming and really fell over backwards to help us.  Special shout out to Alexandra and Arbin. I am sure we will be back soon. Thank you to all the staff who work so hard for the guests.;5
Hotel staff were very accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble. Room was very clean & spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was outstanding, plenty of choice, excellent value for money. Cosy bar area. Fabulous location. Would definitely stay again. Thank you.;5
The room was pretty good - with a good size, comfortable bed, and decent enough shower.  But the hotel is woefully understaffed.  Check in had a huge queue - a twenty minute wait (none of the automatic machines were working), and after finally getting my room key it didn't work!  Apparently the battery in the door had died, so they had to send maintenance - which was another ten minute wait, outside the room.  And although the room facilities were fine, they only provided one towel, which was ridiculous.  The woman on the front desk was pretty defensive throughout, unlike the maintenance woman who was charming and helpful.  I think it's pretty poor that Premier Inn don't clean your rooms now (or replenish teas/coffees etc) unless you request this separately at reception..  So;3
The hotel was the cheapest we could find when looking for a stay. We believe this was probably down to being half-term. But wow, we had a brand new room, which was perfect temperature. There was no sound issues, we couldn‚Äôt hear anything from the outside or surrounding rooms. And most important the bed!! The bed was so comfortable we could‚Äôve slept all day long.;5
Visited for 2 nights in half term. Excellent location near Waterloo and Westminster tube stations. Good baggage storage facility and friendly staff. We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel but we had a drink in the bar which we thought for London was reasonably priced. Rooms usual Premier inn layout, we were surprised at how quiet the hotel was, we all slept really well. Starbucks, boots and M&S food all really close which was handy! We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to London.;5
We stayed at the Premier Inn London County Hall in October 2022 and it is the¬†perfect location! It is just minutes away from the London Eye, Shrek Adventure,¬†London Dungeons etc and you have sight of Big Ben and the House of Commons. If¬†you have children and want to stay close to your hotel when it‚Äôs starting to get late,¬†you can watch the sun set over the skyline. There is a large playground right next to¬†the County Hall, a stone throw away, and there are always live acts, music and¬†street performers to keep you entertained!  As for the actual hotel, the staff were really friendly. We had a triple room and the¬†bed was super comfortable. I would recommend getting the all you can eat breakfast¬†as they provide a huge selection to set you up for the day.;5
Smooth check in, clean hotel and location was the best we have stayed in by far. Reasonably priced for location and easy access to train, bus and tube just a few minutes walk away. Couldn‚Äôt fault it at all, we went to a show and Jack the Ripper tour and both were just a short bus ride away. Would stay here again for sure. Staff were helpful providing towels, pillows and refreshment top ups, nothing was too much trouble.;5
"Stayed in a group of 4 people in two rooms on Sunday 23rd October. Turned up early and left bags in their baggage area. Returned to book in and asked to be allocated rooms together and away from lifts. (Hotel not busy) Rooms 412 and 427 were allocated which are different ends of the hotel. Room 412, is also by the service left!. Exactly want we didn't want (working or not). Air Con plant outside window so a lot of noise. Looked out over rubbish in court yard. Returned to Reception and complained and was told, ""you asked for rooms together"". We pointed out they got that wrong to!. We were then allocated Room 452. Better, not much view much in a no noise area. After a day out in London, returned to have a drink at the bar. Unhelpful bar girl and seemed to be having a bad day, so";3
We stayed here during our three days in London and booked this location as it best fit our budget and had a great location.   The pros of the location: - Small convenience store as well as a Starbucks across the street which were great for early morning coffee and late night snacks.  - M&S around the corner as well as Waterloo station within 5-10 minutes walking distance.  - Hotel located on a closed off street so traffic sounds were minimal.  - Clock tower and London Eye within 5 min walking distance, Buckingham Palace within 15 minutes walking.   This is kind of a hotel area but the other hotels were on the busier streets while this location is tucked away. The hotel isn't shiny and new but provided the basic amenities that we needed such as a really comfortable bed! We spent;4
We have just had an amazing stay at Premier Inn County Hall. Excellent location, affordable price and THE BEST staff we have ever had the pleasure to meet. We felt more than valued, it was like staying with friends. All staff really cared, were interested and passionate about giving the best experience possible. We were sad to leave and will be back. A benchmark for all other staff in other hotels to aspire to. Thank you so much!;5
I have stayed here so many times, the staff are always friendly and you know what your getting. On this occasion the room was so loud it was next to the lift. The beds were really uncomfortable. Lastly my son left some really expensive ear phones in the room. Realises good this 40 minutes after I left on the train I tried to phone the hotel‚Ä¶ 7 hours to get through, I am still waiting for a reply. I know this is my mistake but this could of been rectified before housekeeping even got in there if I‚Äôd of been able to get through on a call. No call back to say if they have found the headphones;1
We attended the restaurant of the Premier Inn County Hall and the waiting staff Danish & Jannut we‚Äôre both friendly, helpful & professional, as a family we enjoyed our evening meal and based on our first impression we decided that we would eat all our evening meals here for the duration of our stay.;5
Stayed overnight at the County Hall. Check-in was dreadful. We arrived 30 minutes early and was told that we could check-in but it would incur a ¬£10 early check in fee! Not wanting to pay for the pleasure of being early we decided to eat at the bar. The choice of food was pretty scant and took forever to arrive. When it finally arrived, the server apologised for the delay but it was obvious that our food had been hanging around in the kitchen as it was lukewarm. We went back to check-in and found the queue was out through the door onto the street. The self-check terminals were not working and with only two staff working the check-in it took forever. We had now wished we had paid the ¬£10-00! Finally got in the room and was pleasantly surprised. It was quite spacious.  we went out;3
We loved this hotel! The location was excellent as it was a short walk to Westminster area and not too far to Waterloo Station. We also enjoyed the play, Witness for the Prosecution, which happened to be in the same building (5minute walk). And enjoyed afternoon tea also in the London County Hall building, another short stroll. Our room was clean and comfy. The service at the front desk was very friendly and helpful especially Francesca. Breakfast buffet was also good. Highly recommend this hotel.;5
Great location for London visit, right next to London eye and pier for boat trip. Have a few restuarants nearby and M&S food.  Hotel is nice and clean. However the hotel is quite busy during breakfast and do not have green veggies but overall food quality is good.;4
Stayed for three days  Day of arrival: Staff walked into the room within 30 minutes of me being there without checking If the room was occupied. The door opened while I was half undressed.  Day 1: Coffee machine leaked. Requested it to be changed. Staff argued it was not faulty. I cleared the leak up myself and then showed it leaking. They then took it away. I also asked for my room to be cleaned, and this did not happen.  Staff tried to clean it after I got back from work which i refused as I was preparing to have a shower, so they left.  Day 2: Toilet cistern stopped working. Had to use glasses of water to flush the loo.   day 3: The power cut out at circa 1945 hours. All power to the room was off, including TV, so I could not watch anything. I gave up and went to bed.  WiFi;2
I chose this hotel because of its location and price and wasn‚Äôt disappointed but mostly I think the staff deserve a mention.   From reception staff to breakfast staff to bar staff they were all very  friendly and helpful.;5
All the family were made to feel special including two young children, who were staying in a hotel for the first time. Restaurant staff went out of their way to help and ensure we were all happy.  Great location.  We will certainly return.;5
I have short hair. And the first day ƒ± saw a long women hair on my bed, its meaning that the sheets were not changed. Also wi-fi is not connecting as well. This is the worst hotel wi-fi connection ƒ± have ever seen. This is the last time in here.  Dont stay !üëé;1
I hated this hotel. No drawers to unpack, very few hangers, no luggage rack, tiny bedside tables & had to use floor, lack of furniture. They was space to add furniture with drawers but none. No working phone in room. They said no phone for added security!! Stupid as the reverse is true. It would have taken very little money for thrm to make the room more user friendly & convenient. I was so unhappy here that I canceled my next reservation in Edinburgh & booked elsewhere. Room is ok for overnight but not longer. Will never book Premier again;2
We were attending a sumptuous event in the city, so wanted a reliably comfortable and quiet hotel room. Our twin room was clean and spacious, and had safety features that made my elderly blind cousin feel safe. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt fathom the coffee machine and we were desperate for morning coffee!! Similarly, the little fridge was great, but we couldn‚Äôt open either of the two complimentary bottles of water! Very friendly staff member registered us early because the room was ready - a very kind gesture.;4
Amazing location, hotel and staff! It's a must when visiting London. Traveled with a toddler and 12 year old.  Food was really good and for a reasonable price  Rooms were clean and beds were comfy.   ..............;5
Hotel staff are welcoming & friendly. Fantastic location. Overall great service superb food and drink. Comfortable room and bed, great nights sleep. Staff very helpful and top class service from all staff;5
The room was clean and very comfy, not noisy, and huge. The hotel is in a great location  and is also nice and clean. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, it was a pleasure to stay there, they are a credit to premier inn;5
On arrival we were met with a building site on our floor, with restricted access to our room. On returning to the room after spending the evening out, we were unable to unlock the door, resulting in 30 minutes of trips to reception, failed attempts at resetting locks, and the delivery of a duvet that we didn‚Äôt ask for. Luckily the bed was comfortable, and after a considerable period of calming down we fell asleep. This wasn‚Äôt for long mind, as the delivery of beer barrels at 6:30 would have been the perfect alarm clock had I have been off to work. (we weren‚Äôt). I‚Äôve stayed at County hall several times before. Tjis time was the last.;3
We booked a family room. Room was huge compared to other premier inn family rooms we have stayed in previously. Room was clean.  We over looked the Italian restaurant over the road so no London eye view for us. However we only used the room as a base to sleep.  Coffee supply‚Äôs were a little short, just one coffee and 2 uht caps per adult. No coffee or hot chocolate for the children.  Shower was great.  Children had no complaints from the bed or the windows (double glazed). Breakfast was busy but manageable. Staff were constantly clearing tables and replenishing the food.  Lifts were very busy at breakfast time. We used the stairs at one point which looked like it was a staff only area so better signage is needed as we thought we would be setting alarms off. However it was great;5
Exceptional location, staff were very friendly, on par with other hotels I have stayed at that were much more expensive but I would sooner stay here again! We could even see the London eye from our room!!;5
Haven‚Äôt stayed here for a good few years but I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Our room had obviously had a makeover & the en suite was lovely, I don‚Äôt know if this will be the whole hotel eventually. Very busy due to the marathon but you didn‚Äôt notice - everything ran smoothly, we were even able to check in early.  Perfectly placed for Waterloo (new station side entrance, very convenient);5
Literally thrown out onto the street for being mere minutes past check-out time. No words. I have stayed here numerous times in the past, without issue, but this time due to circumstances beyond our control (Train strike, stuck in long queue at rental car company, hotel reception  does NOT answer their phones!), from the strike of noon (which was check-out), the hotel manager knocked on our door every few minutes until they forcibly carried our stuff out at 12:15. I returned a few minutes later to find my Dad standing on the street like a vagrant.  I am without words.;1
Absolutely perfect location for visiting London. Westminster just across the bridge, the London Eye literally outside the hotel. We arrived quite late as previously advised and the restaurant was due to close, however they accommodated a couple of weary travellers with a fabulous dinner.  We booked the upgraded rooms and I would say it was definitely worth it. Spacious, very clean and exceptionally comfortable bed. Had everything we needed. Would highly recommend and will be our first choice when we visit again next year.;5
We have similar view, of a courtyard to the one at the Marriott County Hall, where we stayed for one night earlier in the year.  So let me list the differences.  Here the staff are friendly.  Here the door to the bathroom and carpets fit, unlike the Marriott which was  very run down.  Here we can stay for 3 nights for the same price as one at the Marriott. No contest. This is a better hotel for a third the price.;5
I highly advise the people NOT to opt for premier inn county hall. The services are poor and people at the reception are very rude. They miscommunicate and then dont claim what they say. Worst experience ever . Dont waste your money;1
Good hotel for the value. Location was great.  Easy check in and out. Good premier rooms. The housekeeping did not come during our entire stay. Not sure why, but it was okay because we really didn‚Äôt need it.;4
My Daughter and I visit County Hall Premier Inn at least once a year usually twice. Excellent location for theatres, restaurants and all tourist spots. Lovely friendly staff, great rooms comfy bed and superb breakfast;5
The hotel was easy to find (a short walk from Waterloo Station), and everything we wanted to do was within walking distance.  Crossing the river by either Hungerford Bridge or Westminster Bridge and gets you close to a lot of the sights.  We opted for a Premier Plus room which was on the sixth floor and very quiet.  Everything you would expect from a Premier Inn with a larger room and a nice walk-in shower.  The bed was super comfortable, and we both slept well.  The staff were very friendly with a can do attitude.  Breakfast was good and well organised, even when it got very busy.  The room and public spaces were clean and well maintained.;4
Check in, check out and luggage collection staff were excellent. Efficient, helpful, professional, friendly and polite. Room was very clean, comfortable, spacious and well equipped. Location (as discovered on a previous visit) was ideal for our needs. The visit to the restaurant was a huge disappointment. It was 8.45pm and we hadn't reserved a table so had no problem with the 30 minute wait for our table. Once seated we were left for at least 15 minutes with no assistance at all. Two waitresses kept wandering around, occasionally serving other guests but not busy or rushed and it was impossible to catch their attention (without shouting). My husband approached the supervisor (?) who (not politely in my opinion) said they were busy (NOT) and doing their best (if so, oh dear!).;3
Perfect hotel for those wanting a great location for exploring London (100 metres to the London eye and sealife centre). We hardly spent any time in the hotel but the room was comfortable and spacious and had everything we needed except a fridge which would have been really useful as we had a 2 year old with us. Breakfast was good, exactly what you would expect and enough choices for what you are after, very well priced as well, the fact kids eat free was a bonus. We have already said we would use the hotel again the next time we go to London for a short break as when you look at price and location it is a great option. Would have given 5 stars overall if there had been a fridge in the room üòäüòä;4
Excellent family hotel, ideal location for seeing the sights on foot and close to so many transport links. Rooms so modern, Excellent views of the city, room & bathroom size absolutely massive, ideal for chilling at night watching a movie after a long day sightseeing. Recommended the dinner & breakfast deal saves a lot of money & kids eat free with a paying adult for breakfast such a great saving. So much choice at breakfast. Staff were so helpful in the hotel. Would definitely return.;5
Good enough for city trip. But not good enough if you plan to spent more time on the room. Bath room was very outdated and not everything worked as well. Wifi is pretty poor unless you take the paid one.;3
I chose this hotel due to its location and the expected standard of accommodation.   I was attending a conference in the Queen Elizabeth Conference centre and need a hotel within walking distance at a reasonable cost. .;4
Arrived for 3nts  sat to tues of the queens funeral weekend and was allocated a room on 2nd floor...the bed was the most rickety bed I have ever had to sleep in it was falling apart and that was just the start...I  had called to ask about work taking place and was told no work at the weekend, well that was untrue.Due to A LOT of dust  and it was a lot just like a smoke bomb was in the corridor we changed our room to one on a higher floor away from the noise and dust.The lady that dealt with our complaint at first was not very approachable unfortunately i didnt take her name but when we asked to change room she was very moody and stormed off to the office...came back and said we would have to come back after 3pm this was not acceptable to us as it was only 10am and had no plans;4
Firstly, the location is brilliant. Super close to Waterloo and Westminister tube underground stations, London Eye and Big Bus hop on hop off stops.   The negatives: 1. There is no ramp to enter the hotel. All bags need to be lugged up the stairs to enter. There is an assistance button to press, however no one comes to assist.  2. Self check in counters were not open. Check in queue was long and slow. It seems a possible staffing issue? 3. The rooms are very small and in equipped. We had a family room that had a queen size bed (it was very small, so I‚Äôm assuming a queen or double) plus a very flimsy small single bed. There was no fridge at all. There was no safe to hold our passports or valuables. The air conditioning only went down to 19 degrees, which at times made the room;3
Excellent location and an absolutely huge room, this was a very convenient spot to stay the night before a meeting in Waterloo. There was a bit of noise from outside but once my trusty earplugs had been shoved in, all was well. The breakfast was fine and most of the staff were quite friendly. Check in was a bit slow and neither of the self service kiosks was working. All in all though, I slept well and would stay again.;4
Really enjoyed our recent stay in London. Picked this premier inn for location alone I mean right at the London eye can‚Äôt get any better just a shame we didn‚Äôt have a view of it.  Upon arrival at the hotel the staff informed me of a ¬£14 charge that was due as we had to change dates due to having covid- not the staff‚Äôs fault but it wasn‚Äôt something I was aware of so not the best start. The room was good size for 1adult and 2 children the smallest bed was so flimsy though any time my 10 year old sat on it, it creaked and moved certainly couldn‚Äôt hold an adult that‚Äôs for sure.  Couple of down sides although the air con worked it was still super hot in the room and that was in the lowest setting (19 degrees) the windows had to be closed every night as we faced onto the street people;3
"Struggling in finding help for my stay, I telephoned the hotel and spoke to a lady named ""Daisy"", it was if all my concerns floated away! Daisy gave answers to my concerns, making notes so that these could be followed through when I arrived for my stay. All her recommendations were carried out, for which I say ""thank you"". Daisy is symbolic of a good staff member in making your stay a comfortable one with your instructions carried out. The hotel should be grateful for her work application towards guests. Many grateful thanks, I will certainly stay again at this hotel.";5
The staff were friendly but when asked to have our room cleaned and the reception making a note of our room, we came back to the room not being cleaned which meant our towels were damp and still in the bath, disappointing to have confirmation that the room would be cleaned to find out it wasn't. The bed was also not very comfy and duvet was lumpy.;4
We stayed here for four nights, Monday to Friday in September for a birthday trip. Our holiday became slightly different after the news the Queen had passed away the week before, so we knew London would be much busier. As it happened the lying in state queue went right past the hotel door! The hotel itself was excellent, with a great location for seeing the sights. We stayed in a Premier plus room which was very well appointed and had everything we needed. The staff were super friendly and helpful at all times and we would definitely stay again. The only small let down was breakfast, which wasn't very good unfortunately, but we only ate here one morning and just found alternatives on the other days. Thank you to all of the premier inn staff who worked so hard during such a busy;4
This hotel was perfect for me.  The location was wonderful, really close to Westminster Bridge and other attractions, and a 2-3 minute walk from Waterloo tube and 3-5 from Waterloo rail.  Would 100% stay again.;5
Stayed as a group- over the weekend before Queens funeral. Hotel was busy but staff were amazing and helpful. Room was big, good facilities and clean. Had a premier plus and it was huge! Other friends had standard and were also good sizes and good clean rooms and bathrooms.  Premier plus was great for coffee machine, plugs next to bed and iron and hairdryer in room! Was def worth the extra ¬£15!  Wi-Fi didn‚Äôt work though but had great mobile signal and wasn‚Äôt there long enough to have an issue.;5
Happy with the family room, plenty of pillows & towels, clean and well presented.  Plenty of staff around on site for assistance if required, and menu and food available was plentiful.  Happy with water temperature in bathroom and happy with heat in room and available air con if required.  Would stay here again.;5
"This hotel is in a great location; so close into the sights and underground.  The history of the building is one thing, but the location is superb. We stayed on a Plus floor.  I would certainly stay here again in the future.";5
We stayed for 4 Nights in the Premier Plus room, decided to upgrade to treat ourselves.   The room looked really nice, clean, very quiet and the bed was very comfortable.  Included in the room was free bottled water, which is great but you have to ask at the desk every day for another bottle and they're never too happy about it.  Their Ultimate Wifi is included in Premier Plus, but it's very difficult to get a signal and when you eventually do, it disconnects after about 5mins, we ended up using our own data.  The nespresso machine in the room is a nice touch but as we don't drink coffee, maybe include hot chocolate pods in future too?  Location:  The location of the hotel could not be better, you're next door to London Eye, Aquarium, Shreks Adventure, loads of restaurants,;4
Reliable and comfortable with a top location. Very comfortable well equipped room and great staff. Why pay silly prices elsewhere ? Beds are superb and everything is up to date. Only issue was the wi fi which was rubbish in our room (617);5
What an amazing location staff were amazing nothing too much trouble! Would definitely stay again the restaurant was clean and staff were so friendly! The hotel is amazing from the outside clean and tidy! We would stay again as location and service was excellent!;5
My family and I stayed at the premier inn for 2 days. We had a mishap with our booking but the staff that were helping us check in were so kind and really friendly and managed to sort out our booking for us. We were able to leave our bags there as, check in hours were 3pm and onwards.  A lovely note was left for us and a small treat for my family and I. The breakfast was lovely, and the staff were really friendly.;5
I have found writing this few extremely difficult as the location of the hotel and the price were both absolutely amazing.  We stayed for seven nights and the room was large and comfortable. The restaurant was good for both breakfast and dinner and most of the staff were extremely friendly. To be honest, if it wasn‚Äôt for the point I‚Äôm going to make next, I would have given this hotel five stars. We decided to go with housekeeping each day as we were staying for a full week.  This worked really well for the first four or five days but unfortunately one of the days when we returned at about 6 pm our door had been left on the latch so it did not shut properly. This meant that our hotel room had been open to anybody passing by for the whole day. This is a serious security breach. I;3
This was rather a mixed experience. The hotel is in a great location. My room was excellent and large. The bed was big but not comfy. There is really, really good food and some lovely staff in the restaurant. The breakfast is a buffet, but I have a bad back and they kindly helped me. I cannot praise the majority of the restaurant staff highly enough. The Italians were especially agreeable.  However, some of the reception staff were very unhelpful. There is a weird policy about not cleaning rooms unless you tell reception you would like this strange service, which fact isn't properly advertised. It isn't possible to get through to reception on the phone.  As I left I was blithely told that there aren't any chairs in reception when I - doubled over in pain and carrying a walking;3
Staff don't know how to smile or treat the customers well.The staff here were mostly rude and don't know how to treat a person with a disability. I was told when I asked to be back in the hotel through tge awful access way about 8.30 at night and couldn't access it that disabled people normally just go out in the day and that was only one instance;1
The hotel is great I upgraded to a premier room and it was perfect for my stay. The staff was always helpful with any requests I had. Also, you can‚Äôt beat the location and Premier Inn is great value for central London.;5
This is an excellent hotel for many reasons when visiting London. The location is fantastic, and enables the guest to be in an area that provides so many wonderful attractions. Like most Premier Inns, it is functional, comfortable and generally hassle free. I would have no hesitation in recommending it to a friend.;4
30 mins to check in because 1 staff member on at the time. Auto check in machines not switched on. This meant we missed our London eye time.  Staff were rude, beer was awful. Plus side- beds are comfy and clean. Breakfast was 'edible'  Great location for attractions and 2 min walk from Waterloo underground;3
Excellent accommodation . The staff were incredibly helpful, pleasant and engaged with their jobs.  Leyla was on front of house when we had a question, dealt with  it professionally and with a smile. Thank you.;5
I really satisfatied of this lovely experience in premier inn all the staff do an excellent work I won¬¥t hestaite in getting back once again. Big thanks to Alejandra and Abisai for your great help.   Regards  Abraham Vargas;5
Excellent location for a family break in London, you can easily walk into the Center of London for access to the main attractions - Big Ben, Downing Street, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden. Plus a safe walk home after a night at the theatre.  Lovely hotel, with helpful staff.;5
Hotel staff were lovely, Shane about the slow service during evening meal and being woken up early with drilling outside our window as the hotel is undertaking renovation work. Ideal spot for exploring London and in a nice area close to London eye, coffee shops and restaurants.;2
We love this hotel. Easy to reach by train. Perfect central location for sight seeing. Staff so helpful and excellent food when needed. Very comfy beds and air con make for a great nights sleep for 3 generations of our family in family rooms. Can often see London eye from rooms, so that‚Äôs a bonus too.;5
Excellent hotel will everything close by excellent service  would definitely recommend .. nothing was ever too much for there staff .. food breakfast was well worth the money.. will be staying at Christmas witch we do every year;5
Lovely hotel, great location, friendly staff & fantastic room. Would reccomend and it was my 2nd visit. Breakfast good value and choice. Rooms cleaned to a high standard. Close to Westminster and Soithbank.;5
Fantastic stay and a reasonable price meeting all your basic needs when out all day sight seeing. Rooms are well presented, staff friendly and everything is fast and efficient.   Breakfast very good and a decent value while kids eat free promotion is on;5
Staff are always brilliant here. Friendly, approachable and always willing to help. The rooms are great, overall I'd recommend and would stay again. Perfect location for exploring London and couldn't be better fir some of the main attractions.;5
Each year we pick a Premier Inn Hotel in London to stay at (me and 2 children) so we've stayed in lots throughout the years. This was out first time at the County Hall and my kids were so excited to stay somewhere so central and near the amenities!  Checkin in was quick and easy but when we got to our floor (2nd floor) it was obvious there was work going on as there was plastic on the floors and workmen walking around. There was no noise to disrupt us at all but I knew we were in an old section of the hotel and my heart sank as this is our only family trip away and the kids love a premier inn room for how fancy it seems for us!  We were actually put in a family room for wheelchair users so there was emergency cords around the room which I was worried my kids would pull by;3
Good central hotel, with booked parking a few minutes away. The London Eye, River cruise, Shrek, the dungeons, tube station very close by and easy 20 minutes walk to Drury Lane to watch ‚ÄòFrozen‚Äô. Unfortunately, a bit noisy with drunks outside in the early hours of the morning, but not inside, so not the Premier Inns fault,;4
"Arrived an hour earlier than the check in and room was ready.  Room was comfortable, clean and pleasant, also slightly bigger than other rooms we've had in London. Hotel itself was quiet, staff friendly and approachable.  Only issues were WIFI, very poor including the ""ultimate"" which we paid for once.  It's not up to much.  Other issue was external as nearby location had some sort of event going on so could hear bass music until 3.00 am on Friday night. But it was muted with windows closed and we could sleep over it mainly - not hotel's fault at all. Other nights were lovely and quiet.  This is my second stay at County Hall, it was even better  than first time, we had larger room and it was all clean and modern.  Nice to have a bar in hotel for nightcap too. Def recommend for";5
Totally recommend this hotel  It was our second stay here and didn‚Äôt disappoint. The staff were welcoming and helpful  Room very clean  Breakfast very filling  Location brilliant  Will be staying again  Great value for money;5
We were very happy with our stay at the hotel. The restaurant staff were excellent, very helpful and polite. The room was quite large and well equipped.  My only complaint is: the was three of us booked to stay in the room my wife and our Grandson and myself but there were only two towels, when my wife explained to reception and asked for another towel she was told to say please! This infuriated me. Other than that our stay was very nice. Eamonn Davies. Portsmouth.;4
We love staying at this hotel when visiting London. Fabulous location and the beds are so comfortable. We would like to thank Frances who was lovely and very professional. We were given a recently refurbished room on the 6th floor which was faultless and very quiet.;5
Fantastic stop in the heart of London, the executive rooms where large spacious and airy.  Beds where comfortable and the nespresso was a great touch especially being a coffee drinker. Breakfast was good with a small menu but was hot and flavourful.  Parking is limited, so I would advise travelling via train or taxi as everything is a stones throw away;5
"My other half and i stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. I cant fault it! Check in was quick and smooth and the staff advised us of the breakfast times and where to go. Our room (460) was spotlessly clean, abd had everything we needed, tge waterfall shower was fab and unlike some of the recent reviews we had no issues with the hot water. The hotel is under refurbishment but we never heard a peep the whole time we were there.  A few of the reviews have said about the 'awful views"" from their rooms, yes a lot of the rooms face directly on to another part of the hotel instead of the thames but in my opinion if you are staying there with plans to sit and gaze out the window all day then thats a little sad...our curtains were closed most of the time, we were there to enjoy London, not";5
We have stayed at the premier inn county hall many times & always found it to be excellent but this visit Erica was exceptionally lovely & helpful! Thankyou  Erica you are are a credit to the premier inn!;5
Brilliant location, but after spending time here previously the customer service and room cleanliness has slipped. The room didn‚Äôt have enough towels for 2 people and the room didn‚Äôt get cleaned or checked on in the 3 days we were there. No fresh towels, coffee, toilet paper. We did ask reception if someone could just come in and replace towels but didn‚Äôt happen.  However, can‚Äôt fault the buffet breakfast all you can eat. Helps start the day the right way.;3
Room 233 was tiny, delapidated with unpleasant odour and smelly bathroom.  There were no other rooms available.  Reception was always busy or no-one was there.  We were there for our 55th wedding anniversary and a 78th birthday so were very, very disappointed.  Room 233 bore no resemblance whatsoever to the photographs nor to other rooms we have stayed in at Premier Inns.  I have written a letter to the Manager and also sent an email to the Manager but so far no reply.   The hotel is so well situated which is why we chose it but the stay was completely spoilt by this horrid little room.;2
Ideally situated to enjoy London , close to Waterloo . Staff were very pleasant and we were able to leave our luggage on our arrival even though it was too early to check in. Everywhere was very clean and family room was plenty big enough for the three of us with comfortable beds. Breakfast was plentiful and well cooked, the scrambled egg was superb. We would certainly use this inn again.;5
Staff were really considerate and helpful. Clearly it‚Äôs a happy team & well managed. Hotel great location. Breakfast well managed the guy who did this was really nice. Rooms were very nice the hotel seems quite new. Right next the London eye and some good family restaurants close by.;5
Sleep quality in these hotels are normally very good but at county hall premier inn they have a problem with late night/early morning young people with customized cars outside the hotel for hours reving up and loud music. I know this isn't premier inns fault but so many people we talked to in the hotel said the same thing. There is security around the place but they seem to be not bothered. on the pros the hotel is situated in a prime location for things to do and good access. the room we had was large with side view of the London eye and very clean. Staff are very good and always helpful,we had an evening meal deal that included breakfast, great value. We would recommend this hotel again but would ask for a room away from the right side of the hotel because of noise problem.;4
Very convenient location, right next door to London Eye. Consistent Premier Inn experience, I would personally skip the breakfast. It is good value but not really special. Rooms are spacious and clean, location is quiet despite being central.;4
Have just come home from a 5 day stay at the premier Inn in London county hall it was fabulous , room was excellent,staff were great breakfast was amazing so worth paying the extra had a meal deal on the last night 3 courses and a drink each ¬£36 for two  all in ,great location on the south bank right near the London eye and all the other attractions nearby the room was spotless bed very comfortable 5 star stay will definitely go again;5
weve just returned from 3 days here lovely hotel lovely staff ate in the restaraunt each morning and evening beautiful food  brilliant staff particulary a young ladt called kristine who served us our meals each night and even remebered the daughters choice of drink and meal which was lovely;5
Our family of 4 have spent many weekends in premier inn hotels all over the country and this has to be the best one yet. The location is amazing, so close to everything you need to explore.  The room was larger than any premier inn I have every stayed in and exceeded our expectations in every way.  My daughter is a wheelchair user and the staff were so helpful and gave us access to the lift down to the back entrance which really helped.  We didn‚Äôt try the food as there was so much choice in this location just outside the hotel.  We will definitely be booking here again. We all agreed this is one we will visit again and again. Even my 14year old teenager cracked a smile!!!!  Thank you for a truly memorable stay.;5
Stayed 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were all friendly, polite and professional. The room suited our needs being clean, a good shower and a comfy chair. The location was exactly as required. Breakfast was available for a reasonable cost, however we needed to be out early so did not take advantage of the breakfast. Certainly recommend. Bonus was being able to store your luggage after checking out!;5
Great place to stay central, great breakfast worth the money. Comfortable beds and air conditioning. The air con could be a little colder on the hot hot days. Really quiet rooms.  Great bar with a great range of drinks.  Luggage room which is secure and provide with labels to ensure safe returning of you own bags.   Great price will use again;5
"A great base for a few nights of sightseeing. The hotel is under going much needed renovations but we weren't disturbed in any way by this. Thanks to all the hard working staff; we are especially grateful to Leyla in reception who was very helpful and friendly.";4
An incredible family break away for our 20th anniversary. We took our 2 children aged 11 and 7 years with us for this trip and we all really enjoyed ourselves. The hotel is in the perfect location for everything we wanted to do, the girls loved being so close to the London eye and it was a nice walk to see a show and then a meal in Covent Garden. Service was fantastic, very friendly and helpful. We've rebooked for a couple of nights next year too. Thanks again.;5
Can‚Äôt fault the location. Paid over ¬£1000 to stay but the facilities very average/poor. Like ever other Premier Inn, London prices just not London facilities. I expected it to be their flagship. I‚Äôve stayed in better near a motorway.  Bed was far too high off the ground, there‚Äôs no need.   The bed mattress was far too hard and we had to take Paracetamol & Ibuprofen before bed as we both had terrible nights sleep otherwise. We also had to take painkillers in the morning as the mattress is far too hard for your longevity of replacement rather than our comfort. You talk a good talk but they aren‚Äôt the comfy mattresses you brag about. We are both active people and do lots of walking but carrying luggage downstairs because the lifts kept missing the fourth floor and we waited over;1
Stayed here on a short trip to London very clean and tidy and the staff were just so helpful. Family room was large and great for our needs. Beds were comfortable and room very quiet. Very busy at breakfast but everything was always available and regularly re plenished and great quality. The staff make this hotel special everyone was just so helpful and pleasant.;4
First of all, want to flag we‚Äôve stayed at many Premier Inns so take as read we love them.   We know London very well. The location of this place is amazing. For being in the centre of everything next to the most iconic sights, I‚Äôm not sure it can be bettered. Unless you want to fork out ¬£300 a night.  We knew there was refurb work. Some areas of the hotel were very tired, but it‚Äôs all being seen to, so will be great when done.   We had a family room. Great size, quiet outlook, fantastic (and quiet) aircon, everything clean but past it‚Äôs best. Quite an ingrained, but low level, BO smell lingering after windows closed a while. However, what a fantastic night of sleep. Beds and bedding super comfy. We wished we‚Äôd more time to sleep in.  Really happy after seeing everything closing;4
We based ourselves here as part of a wedding anniversary trip to London. Great service right from check in. All the staff we met from reception, maintenance, cleaners and restaurant were very obviously customer focused. Lovely clean room, comfy bed, great bathroom. All public areas spotlessly clean. Breakfast is a must, advise get in before 8.30 or very busy.  Fantastic location for north or south of the river.;5
I love this hotel because it's ideally situated next to the London Eye, everything is withing walkable distance. I have stayed at the Premier Inn County Hall on numerous occasions before Covid and my first impression upon coming back was: it had suffered from the pandemia as they put me into an old room where you had dust ribbons on the edges of the carpet and with a view onto a wall. As I was staying for a whole week I asked to get another room with a better view. What a change: This time it was a newly refurbished room giving on Belvedere - I know I was lucky to get this one as they are usually reserved for families. But it reassured me to know that Premier Inn are trying to keep their standards (they are actually renovating the hotel but I didn't hear any of the works). My;4
Great choice of hotel - one of the best hotel locations right next to the London eye. Family room was spacious & comfortable.  Staff so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was delicious with a great choice. I had to change plans at the last minute and hotel could not have been more accommodating. The quality & service were exceptional.;5
Great location for exploring with children, very near to a great playground, Waterloo tube station, London eye etc. Staff very helpful, bedroom great, shower over bath not great for getting in and out of and would have loved a fridge to have cold water. Gluten free toast available at breakfast along with most items from cooked breakfast. Would have appreciated some gluten free cereals and porridge pots and for this reason, we ate somewhere else on our last morning as I didn‚Äôt want cooked breakfast again. Would definitely return.;4
My friend, children and I stayed here for one night to go to a show and sight see. The teams were on strike so we walked the 2 miles from kings cross to the hotel and it was a pleasant walk and easy to find.  We arrived slightly early to the hotel but we‚Äôre allowed to check in. The process was simple and quick. The room was spacious and had a hairdryer, kettle, tea and coffee (only for two and there were four of us)  The room was really warm and the air conditioning didn‚Äôt seem to cool it but we were hardly in the room.  We had breakfast here which was a buffet and was plenty of choice. Check out was easy and staff friendly.  We walked to the theatre for lion king (around a mile)  Would stay here again as it seemed so central.;5
Room was comfortable, lovely and clean. Had everything you need for a  few nights away. Staff were friendly and helpful. Had a great time! Great location, close to restaurants theatres and bars. Will definitely stay here again.;5
great location in London, close to south bank and many good shops, clean spacious,  comfortable rooms, helpful staff. only problem is the stairs to front door is difficult with cases we had an air con unit which was good.;4
The staff were very helpful and nothing was to much trouble.  The breakfast was plentiful and very good, especially the freshly cooked poached eggs (thank you chef)   The beds were very comfy and had a great nights sleep.   Currently there is building works going on but we were not troubled by noise at all during our stay. The view from the window was looking out to scaffolding but had been informed of the building works before arrival.;5
The location is amazing however the beds were uncomfortable, no safe for personal belongings, no small fridge for longer stays, no phone to call reception- had to go downstairs for everything. Staff needs to be told to provide fresh towels and clean the room ( despite this - it still may not happen) not easy to access to ice. The washroom ventilation is terrible, after 1 shower you can hardly breathe - it‚Äôs too enclosed. Toilet smelled like a urinal at times.;2
Great holiday at a great location. The premier inn is very close to many attractions and London areas. Walking distance to attractions. Great location. The buffet breakfast was back too and staff really helpful.;5
On arrival we went to our room but due to an ear condition I could hear a low frequency noise which made me feel dizzy. I went down and spoke to the lady at check in who immediately found us another room. She was amazing. The room was fantastic. Clean and modern and no noise. Perfect for my fussy ears! We had a fantastic two night stay.;4
Staff were excellent, friendly, helpful  & a credit to the team. The room was large, comfortable & spotlessly clean.   The food was tasty & well presented.  Again, staff were excellent. The location of the hotel was central for most attractions. West end & Covent Garden 20 minutes walk.;5
Picked the hotel as they have family rooms. Room was huge and had a lovely view. We decided to eat there for dinner and the food was delicious. Kids loved it too.I would highly recommend this for a family stay.;5
Stayed at this hotel several times before had no issues until my last visit,this was my worse experience could hear the shouting and noise as deliverys began appropriately at 8pm,this was our first trip since lockdown so was looking forward site seeing around London.;1
Location is so perfect for London. Next to river, 3-5 mins tube (and M&S for snacks for the children!) Rooms fit for purpose. Ours was toward the centre and was very quiet. Due to the size of the hotel they have staff for most functions so it operates very well. Breakfast till 12 is great! Personnel were all great (particularly reception and breakfast team), only one grumpy bar person. For London it‚Äôs a super value place for families.;5
Pros: near trains, tubes,  taxes, landmarks, clean room that looked new Cons: breakfast buffet was dull and boring experience, no ham, cheese etc. scrambled eggs was not real, was made from egg powder! Staff in reception was polite-trained, but did not follow trough. On saturday morning I asked them to change the bed linens etc. not only make the bed. Come back saturday evening, was not changed! Best reception could do was giving me linens so I could change it myself! They promised to change it next day for sure. Next day I told the reception people what happend the night before just to make sure no more mistakes. Came back in the evening, and guess what‚Ä¶. They had just made the bed, not changed it. 1 fault i can accept, but 2 in a row of the same subject, sorry no Premier Inn,;3
Spent 4 nights in a newly refurbished room 2 adults and 2 children who both have hidden disabilities.  First night the bath leaked we had to mop up the bathroom with towels. Next morning spoke to reception and they were going to fix. Second night bath was fixed but toilet would not flush went to tell Recepion this was 7pm was told hotel was fully booked so moving room was not an option and they would contact maintance. 30 minutes later came to the door and the maintanceteam had left and options were to stay in room or there was a room available we could move to. They would also refund 2 breakfast. We decided to move as no toilet til morning  with 4 of us and children with needs. The 2nd room was so much better bigger and better views. No issues with second room. Since coming;4
The hotel is a little tired looking however they are currently renovating it so I expect this will improve.  Otherwise it is perfectly fine for a Premier Inn and in potentially the best location for tourists visiting London, literally right next to the London Eye and an easy walk to Parliament and Big Ben etc.  We found all staff encountered throughout the hotel really pleasant, friendly and helpful.  We had breakfast each day which was reasonable enough.  Our family room was also surprisingly big so we were really comfortable in the room itself.;5
This was our third stay at this hotel and we are already booked to stay again in November. The hotel is in a great position for you to be able to walk to most of the attractions within half an hour.  The hotel is also well placed to access Waterloo station.  The food at breakfast and evening meal were of good quality and price.   The service was good throughout the hotel. The rooms have everything you need including air-conditioning which was definitely needed on our hot weekend.  We always tend to stay in a Premier Inn, in our view they are reliably good and you know what you are going to have a good experience.;5
Excellent location by the London Eye and close to Waterloo tube station for links.  As a family we‚Äôve stayed in a number of Premier Inns and this one was by far the best, not just because of location but the staff were fantastic. Family room was spacious and dining room ran well considering number of guests staying there. The position of our room was very quiet which you don‚Äôt expect in London so good sleep too!;5
Despite being in an older building this premier inn is very smart, well presented  and comfortable. Our standard room was good with with great bed, good bathroom (all very clean) and effective air con despite the 30+ temperatures. Location is very handy for the South Bank, central London and transport.;5
Excellent location, lovely rooms, food was fantastic both breakfast and evening meals had a good choices for all the family and reasonably priced too. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was basic but very comfy beds.;5
"Where to begin....  Paid extra for premier plus room for the Internet and aircon. The Internet coverage didn't reach our room (""oh yeah that happens with some of our rooms"" I was told) and unbelievably the aircon remperature is apparently controlled by the staff so that you can't change it yourself. Unreal.   The hotel itself overall was very tired and pretty dirty and in need of a deep clean. The room was never cleaned and we asked multiple times for new towels, until eventually I had to take my dirty towels down to reception (which was frequently unmanned)  and wait for 20 minutes until someone appeared to change them over myself.    Location was fine and the staff we dealt with were very pleasant and trying their best. However  they were completely overwhelmed and various";1
Location is good, but.... - Dirty toilet seat, still saw disgusting marks around the toilet. - Internet is crap.  It just doesn't work.  I had the ultimate internet service, it still take 2-3 mins to load one email (text only).  Most of the time, there was not signal.  - Chair and desk are dirty.;2
No irons available and when asked a staff for help, was told ‚Äúno English‚Äù. A hotel in Central London employing staff who don‚Äôt even speak basic English to be able to help a guest. Went to a work meeting with an un-ironed shirt.;3
Me and my family have been to this hotel several times and it has been amazing every time! We received superb service from we arrived until we left from the staff and especially from Yan Jacopo in the restaurant who is new but her customer service was the best we experienced! Thank you!;5
We really enjoyed our stay at the County Hall Premier Inn. The hotel was superbly positioned for everything we wanted to do. Everything was just perfect from the lovely greeting we received to the cleanliness of the room, really comfortable bed and excellent breakfast the next morning. It really could not have been any better. Thank you!;5
First time staying at County Hall and will definitely return. Location was perfect for exploring on foot and London was buzzing with visitors but location is really quiet. Big hotel which is run really efficiently by professional and friendly staff. Breakfast was busy but food was regularly replenished . Did not eat there in evening because there are lots of restaurants and bars nearby. The lounge was a nice environment in the evening for drinks.;5
The room was light and airy, with air condition that worked without keep you awake at night.   Front desk staff friendly and helpful as always.   Breakfast freshly cooked and no waiting around for the next batch to come out of the kitchen.  Bar and Dinner very poor.    A member of staff poured whisky BACK into the bottle and the beer selection is not great and much of what there was, was out of stock.   Food served at dinner was fresh but a bit hap-hazard and not presented well and you do need to check what is on the plate is what you actually ordered.;4
Excellent hotel, clean, modern, quiet and close to attractions. + clean + quiet + friendly, helpful staff  - family room bed a bit small - no toilet brush! After 2 nights with a family of 4, the toilet was dirty;5
The best premier inn we‚Äôve stayed at. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. We sure will be going back again. We had the family room, beds were so comfy and the room was clean and it was so peaceful. The breakfast was amazing too and the kids ate free with a full breakfast for adults.;5
I've stayed in County Hall many times over the years.  Its location is excellent and usually the service and rooms are of good quality.  This time however the twin room I booked for two adults came with the usual large double bed and then the smallest single bed I have ever seen.  It was not only small but also incredibly uncomfortable.  I raised this the next morning with Reception as I had a terrible sleep, and they weren't interested.    We only had a couple of beers in the hotel bar on this trip as the beer was awful - whichever variant we went for, it was really flat.  We took two pints back and switched to another beer to be given a similar flat substance - not the usual quality I'd expect from County Hall.  Finally, while breakfast was generally good the staff tidied away;2
Very convenient to many London sites. Staff was readily available to assist with any needs/questions. Comfortable bedding and clean accommodations!  Would highly recommend staying here for an enjoyable stay in the city.;5
From the moment we got there, we were greated with a friendly atmosphere.  The lady on reception(I forgot to get her name) was lovely,  she went out of her way to pick a fantastic room for us and even left us a welcome note with some snacks.  This was very nice.  The room was perfect.  Clean and fresh. With a fantastic view for two teenagers who have never been in a hotel before.  My son has autism and adhd.  These little extra touches made our stay much more relaxed.  I booked the breakfast with the hotel and wasn't disappointed,  food was never empty, hot water a plenty.The only change I'd make is having two options for dairy free milk.  Soya milk was the only one and would have preferred oat or almond milk. In the bedrooms only semi skimmed milk;5
Between our two rooms, there was no tea in one, and no toilet paper in the other, but these problems were sorted very quickly and the stay was very enjoyable, with the cooked and continental breakfast giving excellent value for money.;5
Just returned from a 5 night stay at this Premier Inn with 2 adults, 2 children and a baby.   We can‚Äôt rate this hotel highly enough. We had a brilliant experience and the location is fantastic. Any and all staff we encountered throughout our stay were very friendly and helpful. The room was a decent size, clean and comfortable. Very quiet at night with no traffic noise. Breakfast was good each morning with an excellent selection of both continental and cooked foods to help yourself to.  We‚Äôll definitely look to stay here again in the future as the location was just so incredible for exploring the whole of London. Very easy access to either Waterloo or Westminster underground stations or bus stops to get you almost anywhere central within a very short amount of time.;5
This was a great spot for our week in London, close to transport, close to walk into central London, everything was great. Price was superb! We would gladly stay here again and recommend to anyone who asks.;5
Helpful and friendly staff on the nightshift. Asked a member of staff to help email train tickets to my email address on a word document as it would not allow it over my phone. They sent over the tickets as requested and I was impressed with the service that I had received.;5
Lovely hotel in a perfect location for all the attractions we wanted to see and our theatre visit. Staff were professional and friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them. Food was good at a reasonable price, and the breakfast couldn't be faulted. Will definitely stay again when next in London;5
Travelled with my 8yr old on her first trip to London to this premier inn. It's a great location and we were fortunate to have a view of the London Eye from our room. Our room itself was ok, the bathroom needed a deep clean, loads of marks on the walls, lots of dust on the skirting and there was a continual foul smell in there which escaped to the bedroom when opening the door. We stayed in room 640 and was woken both mornings (5am) by the flushing of the next doors toilet - not the norm, I'm sure but the corridor was also noisy with guests returning (again 5am!) and doors slamming. The breakfast was great, as usual and we ate there 1 night, again fine but having stayed in the Blackfriars one in May, I think this is a better option, even though it's 1.2miles away.  This is the;3
I came to this hotel during my business stay, all staff were lovely and helpful. Leyla was very helpful getting me everything I need and such a lovely girl! Would 100% recommend and will definitely be coming back :);5
The staff were extremely friendly and were happy to help with any needs. My interactions with the staff were friendly, personal and this was due to them being very approachable. The hotel room was clean and comfy and check in and out was easy and stress-free. Besides the queue for the luggage holding, it was impeccable!;5
A great Central London location in the old GLC building, right next to the London Eye. Lovely room and facilities and perfect for any number of London sites. A car park adjacent to the nearby Waterloo Station was very useful too.;5
I have stayed here many, many times, primarily for its location and sadly, each time I visit, the standard deteriorates. Queues out of the door for check in.. no chairs or rest places in reception.. a seen better days bar.. poor;2
I was at Premier Inn County Hall as I needed to attend a function at the Houses of Parliament. The location is so convenient and all is made even better by the very friendly stuff. The breakfast was superb. A very well managed team working really hard during the busy summer holidays. All of them add great value to this hotel.;5
We stayed here for three nights to see Lady Gaga for two nights. The location of the hotel is perfect for getting around and the atmosphere on the Southbank never disappoints.  From the actual hotel perspective, parts of the hotel decor need attention, the carpets needed cleaning  on the 6th floor! This hotel is not cheap and I expect my room cleaned or towels replaced daily without having to ask a member of staff at reception. All staff encountered were lovely but the reception felt unmanned most of the time.  Overall a nice time away and would definitely stay again for the location.;4
we had a very great stay. We spent 3 nights. The central location of the hotel is an important thing. The room was clean, a cozy bed.  For the breakfast everything was ok (continental breakfast).  The staff is available and friendly. Very good point for a good trip.;5
I have stayed in the Premier Inn County Hall previously so knew the location was very convenient for visiting the theatre and meeting friends in the centre. The staff were very welcoming and the room very similar to other rooms in the same chain. I like the consistency! The standard of cleanliness was very high. I had a continental breakfast which had a good selection of products. I did need to use the hotel for a business meeting and was disappointed that there was no facility for this. Friendly staff made this a very pleasant stay which is important when you are travelling solo.;4
Stayed for 2 nights, our room was newly refurbished. Comfortable bed, lovely shower, good touches such as power point at good height for phones etc. All staff friendly, nice to know there was someone on duty 24 hours. Ideally located. Very happy with our stay.;5
Staff are so attentive at this hotel. It was my daughter‚Äôs first time in London and I was a little worried as she is autistic and hates crowds. On Sunday morning breakfast was really busy but Dana made sure she offered a table away from everyone so we could enjoy our breakfast. We will definitely be back.;5
Staff just so rude and made my Boyfriend and I feel very uneasy. There was no need for their attitude which came across and lazy and as if they didn‚Äôt care. Considering the prime location in London where this hotel is situated it is really shocking. Woman at front desk upset me asking ‚ÄúWhy are you staring at me, is there something on my face?‚Äù When we were in full conversation during check in, so where else would I be looking? Made me feel small and had a dampener on the stay then. When retrieving our luggage, we were ignored by two staff members who just walked away, when we had a bus to catch. Just really disappointing and staff just had a couldn‚Äôt be bothered attitude.;1
We had a clean and spacious family room - one double and two singles, with small tv, decent shower and kettle.  The location is perfect for sightseeing, and I'd recommend breakfast (¬£21 for 2 adults and 2 children) - good quality and lots of choice.  Would have given 5 stars for quieter aircon and a king size bed!;4
stayed at this hotel for six nights. we were two parents and two teenagers. the check in was quick and the receptionists very friendly, especially erika who was so helpful and always smiling. our room was a bit dated but still clean, comfortable and spacious. we asked for the room to be cleaned everyday and it was.  the room had air-con which was a must during those past days. breakfast was fine. lots of options but we still missed some fresh veggies and cheese. we will come again!;5
Staff are a credit to this premier inn. We stayed for 2 nights. Note üìù that if you want your room cleaned üßπ you need to request. If you need extra tea ‚òïÔ∏è supplies just ask.  Brilliant location of course. Mario at the Mediterranean Turkish restaurant opposite is a hoot if you want somewhere to eat locally. We also went to neds noodles and all bar one round the corner;5
Wow! Perfect location! Waterloo is the closest station, Westminster not too far either. Our room was huge! We had one double bed, x2 singles. Room 401.  Staff all very helpful. I asked them to decorate room for my daughter's birthday which they did do and placed banner on door and balloons and banners inside. Room was very comfortable, shower was good too. Best location to go site seeing as all walking distance. We hardly used the tube as all so easy to walk to- Covent Garden, Downing Street, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace. We used the Uber Boats to O2, worth it as see lots along the Thames. Would highly recommend this Premier Inn, can't faulty it. Breakfast was fab too with lots of choice.;5
We stayed at County Hall, hotel was clean and comfortable, perfect location for our 3 day trip. We had one meal in evening which was very preasobanly priced and good. Breakfast on both mornings was fresh and topped up regular and plenty of choice even at 9.30am which I normally find not the case in most budget hotels with buffet breakfast. The breakfast areas were spotlessly clean. My only quibble was the bed was too high being 5ft 1 but one in I had a very good night sleep;5
I do t often leave reviews but I feel it‚Äôs important to take the time to recognize when exceptional service is received. After having to leave our previous hotel at 1am due to room issues, Matthew at Premier Inn was an absolute hero. We arrived and explained our situation and he could not have been more helpful. He arranged accommodation for our family of 5 and sorted out everything we needed for a pleasant stay. The vote itself is central, clean and has everything we needed for our family. Overall, the move to Premier Inn turned out to be a substantial bonus, despite the earlier stress of moving hotels. We would definitely stay again.;5
I‚Äôve stayed here a few times and each time is better than the last. Great location and lovely staff. The food and atmosphere in the restaurant is great. The hotel itself is located next to the London Eye so ideally place for tourist visit. We‚Äôll be back soon. Thank you.;5
Great location and good value hotel in central London on the South Bank. Basic room but clean and quiet. Good breakfast. Helpful and friendly staff. H√¥tel is next to the London Eye and a short walk from the National Theatre, Westminster and the Tate Modern.;5
Premier Inn County Hall has been our family go-to hotel to get down to London & explore with our 2 boys. Awesome location it‚Äôs a great base to navigate across the city for Buckingham Palace, Museums, Hamley‚Äôs you name it.  Underground car parking just opposite (directly beneath Waterloo Station) is ideal if you‚Äôre driving into the city as we do.  We‚Äôve always had a peaceful, comfortable nights sleep with the next day kicked off with a great cooked breakfast to set you up for a days exploring.  This is our go-to base when coming down for a weekend in London - well done Team County Hall - keep up the good work! üëçüëç;5
Clean, comfortable, friendly helpful staff. Good location close to a lot of attractions. Breakfast well cooked and plenty of variety especially if you have children. Definitely recommend for all means of reasons to visit London.;5
The hotel is in a great location so close to all the attractions and it was fantastic for all my family. It was the first time for my children in London and they loved it. We had dinner in the restaurant every evening and the service was great. Our room had been recently refurbished and it was a plus to an already wonderful stay at this hotel. I would recommend it to anyone going to London with their family!;5
We stayed at the Premier Inn County Hall, a iconic building I grew up knowing about. So pleased I choose to stay here the location was perfect for Southbank, Westend, Trafalgar Square and afar. The  second day spend visiting London Eye and Sherk experience on the door step, meant we could have leisurely breakfast. Well done Premier Inn, staff friendly too.;5
I stayed at this hotel in occasion of my wedding anniversary! I had phoned up to request a room with a view and not only we had a great view but they also prepared a bottle of fizz that we absolutely loved when we arrived! We had breakfast both mornings. The restaurant was super busy but the team were so well organised and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back!!;5
a reasonable priced hotel for the night. Bed was very comfortable. One major negative was the unexpected stains on the bath towel, quite unhygienic and disappointing (didn‚Äôt bring this up at the time as I found it late and needed to check out quickly);3
I have stayed here a few times and it is always friendly,  clean and an outstanding location.  I particularly like the southbank and being next to the river and London eye is particularly cool.  This is definitely one of my favourite Premier Inn's;5
From start to finish our stay at County Hall premier was excellent the reception team where brilliant very friendly, our room 511 was immaculate the bed was really comfortable & well equipped with all we needed for a fantastic stay. Breakfast in the morning was gorgeous all the hot food was boiling hot so when we got to our table to eat it was still hot. The location is brilliant central to the Thames and really close to Waterloo Station,   choosing Premier Inn County Hall was the best decision I'd made to stay at.;5
Really brill stay overnight at this hotel. Me and my daughter stayed here It exceeded our expectations . Central location close to everything. Lovely room in premier plus, crisp clean bedding , able to open small window which was great as often in hotels you are unable to get fresh air. Good nights sleep and great breakfast. Will definitely stay again on trips to London.;5
Happy can do staff without the attitude you sometimes find in more luxurious hotels It does what it says on the tin and then outperforms your expectations Spacious room with good lighting very efficient air con, very comfortable bed choice of pillows and tea and coffee. We wanted herbal tea bags and they cam almost immediately!;5
Blown away by this budget hotel in the centre of London. Very welcoming.  Good quick service.  Well priced.  Recently refurbished room. The hotel was fully booked when we stayed, but even so, hours after we checked in, the girl who checked us in recognised me by name.   Very impressed!;5
I used to love staying at this hotel but my visit in May was the worst experience of Customer Service I have ever received anywhere. I had an accident during the night where I required an Ambulance. We were on the 5th floor so my Husband went to Reception to ask for help, non was forth coming.  Whoever was on the desk gave my Husband the wrong postcode (Ambulance Crew told us this as they had difficulty finding us), didn‚Äôt ask for any details and definitely did not fill out any Accident Form.  During the 7 hour wait for the Ambulance, not once were we checked on and my Husband, who was really upset, was never offered a second room key, so every time he went to Reception to see if an Ambulance was there, I was left on my own, in agony, in the dark. Even the ambulance crew were;1
Great Hotel near to London landmarks. Friendly staff. Would definitely recommend. Great buffet breakfast and evening meal with lots of choice to suit everyone in our group of 11. Issue with one of the rooms resolved quite quickly. Staff are friendly and helpful.;4
Great stay as always The receptionist Erica was particularly helpful. She went out of her way to assist. The air conditioning was magical as the weather outside was 40 degrees. The location of the hotel is perfect for all the London attractions;5
"The Premier Inn at County Hall has really gone downhill since we last stayed here. Surprisingly, the last time we were here the hotel also said they were ‚Äúunder refurbishment ‚Äú. The breakfast, as always, was varied, fresh and good value. It is the hotel itself that is in poor shape. The room amenities are virtually non-existent, the towels are threadbare, the furniture is old and in poor shape. The location is superb, and probably why most people stay here. The wifi bears special mention... Without doubt it is the most pathetic excuse for included wifi i have tried to use... It is extremely difficult to contact the hotel. I tried 13 times to call the hotel from Canada without success; they simply did not answer. I finally was able to communicate through the Messenger app. A";2
Not sure why we had not stayed here before as great location next to the eye. I was expecting traffic noise as central London but was pleasantly surprised. The staff were some of the best premier inn staff we have encountered. The room had air con and you could open the windows which was lovely as we had a nice breeze blowing in. We would stay again.;4
Great location on the south bank close to the London eye and easy access to central London.Plenty of places to eat nearby.Room was clean and comfortable with everything you need. Breakfast was good value;4
Our first return to London and the County Hall Premier Inn since before the pandemic - what a treat... friendly, helpful staff, great rooms and superb location for accessing Southbank and the West End (our places of choice). Will defo be booking again, and again and again. Thanks all üåªüåªüåª;5
set next to London Eye, great for sightseeing and commuting. 3rd stay here and definitely will be back. Clean and comfortable rooms and a great nights sleep. Handy for Waterloo Station, but a lot of London attractions within walking distance;5
Excellent location,great service and food.Would definitely recommend good value for money. The room was very clean good size and very comfortable.The staff were first class and pleasant assisting when required.A great weekend place to stay for theatre and sightseeing.;5
Very decent hotel, has all that is expected of a typical Premier Inn and of course it‚Äôs in a brilliant London central location. I stayed for two nights and no complaints from me at all. The noise from the hotel during the night was somewhat a disturbance but is to be expected from Central London and was well muffled by closing the windows.   The room was clean and tidy and breakfast was well cooked and wide ranging as usual from a Premier Inn.   Would return to this hotel again if ever I need to stay the night in London in the future!;5
We enjoyed a 2 night weekend stay at county hall. All the staff we encountered were amazing-professional polite but also extremely friendly. The room was clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was fresh, hot and delicious. The hotel is brilliantly placed next to the London Eye, and very central for attractions and a pleasant walk to theatreland.;5
Great hotel in a great location next to London eye.We had a refurbished family room which was great for 4 of us,clean and added extra of rolo sweets and personalised welcome letter in the room.Dinner b+b deal was great value for money and food was good.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Located on South Bank which has lovely walks and summer festival added to lovely London experiences.;5
Overall, our stay was fine apart from the WiFi. I wanted to get some work done from the room but 4th floor corridor had absolutely no wifi coverage, to the point where I had to go down to the bar to work. I paid for the ultimate internet but the issue wasn't speed, it was the fact that the room did not recieve wifi signals.  Apart from this heavy drilling/construction work began at 9am which was super noisy.;3
This is a great hotel and near some great attractions. The rooms were really nice and confutable. Had a really good night sleep. The staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant had amazing evening food as well as breakfast in the morning.;4
Very good value, tasty, well cooked dinner. Lovely salmon and succulent chicken. Excellent attentive and friendly service from Miriam, Marvin and Dana. Only reason not a 5 was very lacklustre house red and no wine list on the table. We didn't know which wines were included in the meal deal as nothing specified. It needs to be made much clearer what's included, as it used to be.;4
Lovely location right behind the London Eye. Handy for tube and river travel. Very clean with nice recently refurbished rooms. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was nice and lots of choice. Would definitely stay here again;5
Excellent location for Westminster and the London eye.  Check in can be busy but goes down soon  All staff we encountered were friendly and polite We stayed for 4 nights in room 415. Room was clean and spacious overlooked the front of the hotel which during the day early evening is busy but at night it does get quiet and we slept with window open and no issues with noise.  Didn‚Äôt have breakfast as so many wee cafes close by and the bakery at marks and spencer does lovely crossiants.  Had dinner one night which was reasonable price wise with good quality food and good service.   Room wasn‚Äôt serviced but can be requested  Any time we asked for fresh towels/milk there were no issues.    Definitely stay here again;5
Hotel is in a great location on the South Bank. Nice room to the usual Premier Inn standard. The hotel staff were excellent and couldn't do enough to help, especially the reception team. Will definitely stay here again.;4
Comfortable and clean (typical Premier Inn). Excellent location for London Eye and lots of the main sites as well as Waterloo station. Room was air conditioned which was welcome on arrival. Recommended!;5
My daughter recommended this hotel and it did not disappoint.  The location was perfect for a family meet up in London.  Cleanliness could not be faulted.  Just remember your toiletries and you will have a wonderful stay at a great price.  Hubby had breakfast one day (I don't usually eat breakfast) and he said it was great.  Thank you Premier Inn London County Hall. Excellent front of house and cleaning staff.  Very well done all.;5
We could not have picked a better hotel in London.  From the reception staff to the breakfast staff we received excellent service all round.  Our recently renovated room could not be faulted there was air conditioning which was greatly needed on out heatwave weekend.  We looked out over a courtyard but didn't bother us as it was nice and quiet for sleeping and the bed was very comfortable as well.  Cleanliness could not be faulted in all areas.   The position of the hotel along the river embankment, the London Eye, Parliament was spot on and within walking distance of sites or Waterloo/Westminster tubes if needed.  The breakfast was excellent we did not have an evening meal as we had a show and meal already booked but if you wanted anything different there were many restaurants;5
Stayed for 3 nights  Room was clean and ample for 2 adults.  Bed was very comfortable but creaked a little when we turned over.  Only 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel were provided but we asked for more and they quickly obliged.  We opted for full breakfast which was buffet style. Plenty of choice and delicious.  Both check in and check out were smooth and the luggage was kept in a secure room until we were ready to travel home.  Staff were friendly and approachable and very attentive.;4
the location is superb, the breakfast correct, but every morning asking if I wanted my bed to be made or not???? and despite I asked for it they did not make my bed, nor hoovered the carpet.....I use to stay at premier Inn and I am always satisfied as I know what it is, basic, clean, good prices and good locations. I will stay at premier inn Holborn in August, lets see if it is the same...;3
As always the Premier Inn did not disappoint. This one is in a fabulous location, near to attractions and transport.  We had a Premier Plus room which is an upgrade on the standard rooms, I‚Äôve always been happy with the standard room which are well equipped but we thought we would try it and we were not disappointed - there are a few refinements to enjoy such as bigger rooms with a sofa and chairs to relax in, upgraded toiletries ( very nice!) and a nespresso machine. The bathrooms had bigger showers and looked updated. No Gerbera pictures either.  Check in was fine, short wait for staff and the check in machines were out of order.  Security is good with a room key required to access the lifts.   We did not eat dinner as we had plans but the menu catered for all tastes.  Despite;5
there doing a lot of work there but did not really bother us rooms clean and tidy did not have breakfast at hotel went round corner to gails beautiful coffee and pastries would stay again wonderfull friendly staff;5
From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we couldn‚Äôt fault the excellent attitude, friendliness and service at this very busy London hotel.  Despite it being one of the busiest weekends with London Pride, the Rolling Stones, Adele and Wimbledon and the hotel full, there was always a member of staff going there extra mile for us to make our stay so enjoyable.  A case in point ‚Ä¶ I wanted some lemon and couldn't see any on the breakfast bar so I asked a member of staff (her name was Dana) if she could help.  With a great attitude and a winning smile, she came back within minutes with a full size lemon for me.  Another member of staff went out of her way to locate a particular location for us with a willingness to help which way exceeded our expectations.  The room was;5
Just got back from a long weekend at this Hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone as it is in a great location, is very clean and tidy, has friendly and professional staff and good food. Would definately stay there again!;5
Upon our arrival we noticed that our room was dirty, bloody tissues under our bed, stains on the sheet and dirty ear buds on the floor. After asking to speak to a manager, we were left waiting a long period of time and had to leave due to a show. We asked again on our return and then decided it was best to move hotels due to the lack of customer service and the dirtiness. When we returned home I sent an email to customer services with no response, I also rang and again had no response. Very disappointed with the service, and it wasn‚Äôt the first poor experience at this hotel.;2
We stayed in the hotel for three nights. The room was brand new, very clean, bed was so comfortable, staff was friendly and food at breakfast were plentiful. Great location. We will definitely stay in here again when we visit London in the future.;5
Excellent location, the major reason (with price) for our selection. The staff were pleasant, if a little busy / flustered when we checked in. The room felt a little tired, and some areas of the floor we were on were bing refurbished. The room was nice enough, but felt as if the standard premier inn furniture had been plonked in a room that could have benefited from a more tailored approach. We would stay again, but will ask for a recently refurbished room.;3
My stay at the premier inn London County Hall was unpleasant. Great location but shanty town environment. It didn‚Äôt worth the money . Out of my 15 days stay, several days no hot water. I spoke to front desk. I am as told to go next door and take a shower. I had to pay to go to another hotel for two days to take a shower. I complained to guest relations and nothing was done. The breakfast was horrible. I had to cancel. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend any to stay there. My rating is 1. The hotel never notified me that there was hot water. After my 15 days I checked into another premier inn the hub on 21 Tothill St, my stay there was awesome. It was welcoming and worth it. London county hall workers are unprofessional and there is no inclusiveness in hat establishment. They only pretend that;1
The room was spotless!! The location was really convenient, close to Westminster, London eye, underground satiations, bus stations! Restaurantes in front the hotel . The staff was very nice and helpful!;5
All was going well until there was no hot water for the whole hotel for a night and the following day. Rooms are clean and tidy. Luckily the builders weren't working on the scaffolding outside the windows or we would have had them peering in the window in the morning and making a racket. Come on Premier, No Hot Water, not great is it.;3
This hotel is well placed near Westminster,London eye and many London attractions.  The rooms are clean and the breakfast is good. The only one major problem is the height of the baths in the room very dangerous especially if you are short.Also no grab rail to get in and out of the bath which you find in most hotels . This really needs to be looked at.;4
We booked this hotel online and was happy to find it next to London eye and Big Ben. What i was furious about was when we checked in we were not told that the water heater for the whole hotel is broken down.I went down few times and the response by front desk was alwsys different   1.The service guy gone back and will bring parts tomorrow   2. Service guy will rectify by tonight  The next morning it was the same until i checked out. I even email to the hotel but no reply till date.  So I will not recommend this hotel anymore By the way there is no toothbrush and toothpaste also;1
A great hotel right in the heart of the South Bank - easy walking distance for lots of main attractions. The hotel was very clean with friendly helpful staff. Nice breakfast and easy luggage storage and retrieval at no extra cost. Simple check in and out and I felt safe there on my own. Also, very near to Waterloo train station and short walk to Embankment Tube station. The room was quiet and clean and very comfortable.;5
The building is old and stuffy. Some staff members were very unfriendly. The room was filthy when I arrived and was badly cleaned after I requested service (they didn‚Äôt even empty the trash can). We had 2 days with NO hot water and staff was very unhelpful about that.  Location is amazing;2
Pros:  the hotel is well situated for sight seeing.  It is also well priced, with a friendly staff and a plentiful breakfast option for not much money.  Cons:  the room was quite dumpy, with a fairly poorly constructed mattress.  The air conditioner was quite weak.  The wi-fi was terrible, even the paid option.  The breakfast was not particularly well cooked or seasoned. And vitally, the hot water for the entire hotel shut off for almost 24 hours, right during shower times.;3
The hotel is is in a great location within distance to loads of tourist attractions. All the staff are very welcoming & helpful specially Alejandra who made a fuss of our son.  The breakfast was plentiful, lots of choice, we went down for breakfast between 7:30 - 8:30 which was ok but after this time it did get quite busy.  We stayed in room 408 (newly refurbished) spotless, clean & overlooked the front of the building (entrance). There was still work being done but we hardly heard anything & our sleep wasn't interrupted.   We stayed for tea one night which was good bog standard but if you don't want to move very far from base it will fill your belly.  We will stay here again & already planning the next visit, overall great stay.;5
As usual the Premier Inn at County Hall lived up to expectation.  I always book this place because of it's location, good value for money, very attentive staff and comfortable hotel rooms.  We had a bit of an issue with noise outside on this occasion but that is the first and only time this has happened in the 10 years that I have been going to this hotel.  I highly recommend.;5
My family and I have visited this hotel for over 10 years however I was more disappointed with this stay than ever.  Firstly our room was located on the third floor, a floor currently being refurbished. Our room was extremely dusty which I can only imagine is coming from the renovation works. Secondly the cleanliness of the room has been appalling compared to other years and I was shocked to find out that now you have to request your room to be cleaned each day - something they could have told us at check inn.  Obviously the location is what helps make this hotel located a the quiet street and v close to the centre of London. However sadly I think for my next trip I will be looking elsewhere;3
The peaceful embankment side location made for great city access if you wanted it, with a convenient bag drop facilities. Great for Uber boat and O2 posy concert return  Borough Market and Sky Garden. Just as Premier Inn advertise. A great night sleep and THE BEST location.;5
"If you want a good nights sleep then consider staying on a park bench rather than here.  Our room had clearly not been maintained - the bathroom had dripping taps, mould on the walls and a broken extractor fan.  Outside the room were two industrial aircon units which made a constant din all night.  We asked to move rooms but were refused.  We slept just 3-4 hours and made an official complaint, but other than a miserly ""good will refund"", Premier Inn declined to honour their Good Night Guarantee or even discuss the issues with the room.";1
The hotel had no hot water on the last day of my stay. The only resolution they had was to offer a free breakfast that I didn't have time for.  The room itself was ok, blackout curtains were good for sleep. The bathroom wasn't adequately cleaned with some left over hair near the sink and the sink didn't drain properly.;2
Stayed for two nights arriving Thursday 23 June ‚Ä¶ the down side we were allocated rooms on floors two and three - the third was a building site lots of dust.. we were relocated  to floor 4 and the room was fine. All in all the location, cleanliness, and staff were great  However from Thursday till after lunch Friday no hot water ‚Ä¶ not even warm ‚Ä¶ when we checked in they must have been aware but did not say anything to us. When we went to reception to report it we were in a line of others it was clearly impacing on  the whole hotel this is a basic need.  If it had hot water this would have been a four plus rating from me but sorry Premier Inn it is best to share the problems than take the money and await the dissatisfaction of your customers;3
I have to say this was the best hotel experience I have had in a while. This was my first trip to London and we chose to stay at the Premier Inn County Hall due to to it's great location near so many attractions. Everyone at this hotel was so kind. I really want to recognize Daisy, Sylvia, and Rasel for their customer service, kindness, and overall commitment to our stay.;5
Always use Premier. Stayed here before. This time couldn't  get through in advance. Tried for two days. Wanted to check an hour early or drop off cases. Had to take them to first appointment. No hot water on the night we stayed or in the morning. Very hot day. Slightly spoiled the trip.;4
Absolutely nothing was good at all. The service was horrible the staff wasn't friendly. No room service. No hot water. No telephone in the room. No amenities like toiletries. AC doesn't work well. The wifi didn't work even after paying for it. Not worth it at all.;1
we stayed here during the jubilee celebration. we were welcomed by so many nice receptionists and our room was very nice and clean. we has breakfast and dinner, and we thought the quality of the food is execllent. next time we are back in London we will stay here.;5
Second time we have stopped here - amazing central location for London - paid for parking locally As always hotel very clean and a great night sleep - its what Premier Inn do best, We alays use Premier inn because of this. Disappointed they have stopped servicing rooms unless you ask and with the inflexibility of the restaurant;4
We got stranded in London and was directed to here by train station concierge, may I say considering we where drenched through looking rather the worst for wear.. they restored my faith in my fellow man to go the extra mile with their kindness and professionalism and found us safe refuge for the night.. so truly thank you both üíï  The room was a dream, clean, roomy and so comfy.  The breakfast was gorgeous, I know where I and my family shall be booking all our London stays in the future.üíïüíïüíï;5
We booked this hotel for a nice weekend away. We were impressed by the lovely welcoming staff and of course the perfect location. The room was very clean and the food is excellent too. The hotel is going under refurbishment but we were not bothered at all because it did not ruin our stay not disturbed us. The bar serves lovely drinks at a very reasonable price too.;5
Welcoming and consistent high quality. Quiet despite the location. Up to date, clean room. Enough, helpful staff. Get anywhere on the River, Houses of Parliament, Covent Garden, Soho, and other central sights.;5
Disappointed as it was the first time in a long time I have done premier inn. It was not the standard I have come to expect from them. Check in poor. Room poor. Yes location location but that‚Äôs it everything else is low quality. Better hotels around for similar price;3
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this hotel. I have stayed in several premier inns before so I know what to expect and this one didn‚Äôt disappoint.  The location was/is perfect and was so close to everything we needed. It was my mums birthday so I rang before and asked for a room with a view. We got an amazing view of the London eye thank you so much, we even got to check in an hour early!   With the windows open the room was quite I mean it wasn‚Äôt completely silent by any means but it wasn‚Äôt as loud as we were originally thought it was going to be. The room was clean and so was the bathroom. The best part was we booked a twin room and to our surprise we got two double beds usually we get a single/sofa bed and then a double or king so this was really nice.  Our room wasn‚Äôt;5
Great location, reasonably priced. Customer service basically doesn't exist. They don't even have a telephone in the room so there is no way to communicate with the front desk. . . if they had one. The room was clean and modern, but very small, and no, that's right, NO! place to unpack our clothes except for a small closet with a few hangers. No dresser or drawers anywhere.;3
Paid extra for this room however the WiFi was terrible and I wasn't contactable which left me feeling anxious. The kettle even after being half filled kept boiling over and I burnt my finger and had to keep cleaning up lots of spilled boiling water. The TV volume restriction was a good idea in theory however with the outside noise it wasn't watchable. When I left I wanted to tell the member of staff on the desk but was put off by her unfriendly manner and I wasn't even asked how my stay was!!;2
The hotel location is great.  The food was nice. The rooms need an update as they felt very old. I felt like they needed a good clean. I have stayed in lots of premier inn hotels and this is probably one of the lowest standard ones I have seen.;3
Brilliant stay here over the Jubilee weekend. Staff were excellent, hotel was clean and staff were more than happy to help us with any questions. Great if you want to stay in central London. Definitely will be returning.;5
The location was fantastic and the exterior of the hotel stunning. Beyond that, it was ‚Äòjust‚Äô a Premier Inn at significantly higher prices. We stayed two nights and the bedding and towels weren‚Äôt changed after arrival. The beer was disgusting. The family room was a standard double, single and camp bed. The camp bed was small, creaky and uncomfortable.   All in all, for the price I expected better.;3
