I travelled Nov. 3rd to Nov. 17th. Not my first trip to this resort, but I was a little worried to travel so early in the season. Departed Toronto just an hour late and arrived after an amazing flight with OWG into Holguin. This is a new airline operated by Hola sun and I was very pleasantly surprised. The food was the best I have ever had on a plane - served piping hot with the most wonderful brownie!! The flight crew were personable and professional. The flight was not full, so weight limit were a little flexible. Most of the plane was full of tourist staying in Holguin and only 7 of us boarded a small bus/taxi to Santiago. We did stop about half way there and were able to grab a beer, use the facilities and have a quick smoke. Off to Santiago where we had 2 stops to drop off;5
Beautiful area. Rooms are old and antiquated. The staff at the lobby bar ran the place. Would save glasses and tables for their guest friends to the point of being ridiculous. I like to tip for service, not tip to get service. Been to many all inclusive and this is definately lower tier.;1
It was our 15th trip to Cuba since 2009 and third to the Hotel Carisol los Corales, so we knew what to expect. We paid $1,295 CAN per person for 2 weeks (from Toronto) for a junior suite in the Carisol Section.  We departed Toronto on January 8, 2020 from Toronto’s Pearson Airport (Sunwing Airlines). The take-off was late due to deicing. The flight lasted 3 hours and 41 minutes and we landed in Santiago de Cuba.  Because of TripAdvisor’s Cuban forums, I knew that unexpectedly the US dollar had become a hot commodity in Cuba—and we happened to have plenty of US dollars anyway. Within minutes of getting on the bus we exchanged $200 US and got 200 CUC—more than enough for our whole stay. I also ran to the nearby kiosk and got 2 cans of Cuban beer (Cristal). It turned out that I;3
Stayed at Los Corales March 03-10. Amazing, very friendly people. Recommend Marleidis (Customer Service), Miguel (dishwasher/helper). Victor (Ranchon-ask him for honey), Elizabeth (Ranchon waitress), Iliana (maid bldg 5). Jorge (Pool Bar), Argelio (security guard) The beach is OK--definitely not sandy like Varadero, and no turquoise water either. But, if you bring snorkels you can see colorful fish between the shore and the reef.  The food is basic--small buffet with the same thing everyday. The longest lineup is for omelettes every breakfast. Forget about desert & ice cream--non existent. Also, they are not big on fruits--may be March is not the best time of the year for fruit.  The best food was at the Cuban restaurant, so we booked it almost every day.  Strong rain/wind;3
This was our second time staying at Amigo Carisol Los Corales, previously 3 years ago. We said we would never return due to a variety of issues but decided to anyways because of the $650 price tag.  Im glad we gave it another try, this time was much better! We had a great week!!!  We stayed on the Carisol side in a suite which was nice and big.  They say the suites are renovated, although the decor appeared it was from the 90’s , but I do think the bathrooms were redone in last few years.  The suites were clean, big, comfortable and a nice upgrade.  After seeing the bungalows on Los Corales side i would say they have a better ocean view and are closer to most resort amenities then the suites, but I have to say the suites were great.  Carisol side is perfect for those wanting;3
Being in our late twenties my wife and I were easily the youngest couple by at least 20 years. That being said we had a fantastic time and will be back.  We stayed on Los Corales side of the sister resorts. Our room was in need of updates but it was good enough to sleep, shower and put your bathing suit on in. Didn't bother with the in room safe and instead opted for our locked suitcase and just kept the key with our room key (which is an actual key) with no issue. Breakfast was always good, omelette station was fantastic with Elizabeth always fast and smiling. Lunch with burgers, hot dogs, pizza was always fast and easy. Dinner with two hot stations, rice, potatoes, and a mix of other dishes was always good. Anything on the buffet was typically not hot, but there was always;4
Travelled to Los Coralas Feb 11 to 25 with my wife.  We both had an enjoyable 2 weeks.  The staff were friendly and accommodating.  We always had adequate hot water in our room.  The air conditioning worked fine during our stay.  The food was adequate for our needs.  No significant shortages.  Students were working in the restaurant and did an excellent job.  These students are not paid but told us they get to keep tips.  Be generous. Something that needs to be corrected is the amount of food taken out of the restaurant by  a few tourist.  This results in  less for guests and results in waiting longer in line at the grill.   Also too many dogs -  need to be removed. We would return to this hotel next year if the price is right.;4
Travelled to Carisol los Corales in Feb 2020 with hubby. We stayed on the Corales side, as we have in the past but spent lots of time on the Carisol side as we prefer their lobby. Much larger and more comfortable chairs. It was a very pleasant 2 weeks. The weather in the southern part of Cuba is one of their biggest assets. We enjoy the beach here because it is large, and has many trees. There is enough room for everyone and always a choice of sun or shade.  The staff are excellent and do everything possible to make your vacation comfortable and enjoyable. There was always Cristal beer during our visit and red wine in the restaurant. There was an abundance of lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage & carrots during our stay, but a shortage of fruit, especially papaya. The only other fruit;3
"1. Going through Cuban Customs is a mess - the exits from immigration booths are very close to the security checking machine blocking your way out. 2. Travel from the airport takes around 1 hour.  3. Check-in smooth. Alejandro was very helpful. 4. There are good and bad rooms. 5. 110V 6. Food with very limited choices. Do not drink water from the vases because birds like to take baths in them. (wondering where did the cooked/grilled chicken breasts go - not seen around. 7. Some Staff needs to be retrained on how to serve clients properly without expecting tips. 8. The staff has been seen eating oranges and other delicacies, not seen at the restaurants. 9. Beach, not the best - weeds & small sharp shells/stones in the water. 10. Security Guards present; however, some illegal";2
My family and I absolutely loves this little gem! Beautiful rural scenery, with the Sierra Maetra mountain range to one side and the ocean to the other. Hard to beat the staff and other locals, offering horse and buggy rides to the nearby lagoon and aquarium. Rooms are clean and have everything you need for a comfy stay.  Food is simple but consistently good. The only change I would like to see them make is getting rid of the plastic cups and straws that are offered at the pool bars, and the disposible stir sticks served at the lobby bars. I have reached out to the hotel to offer to help them purchase reuseable plastic cups. Lots of guests brought their own travel mugs, which I would encourage all potential guests to do. Looking forward to returning once this change has happened;5
My wife and I have decided for a last minute one week retreat in Cuba with Sunwing Vacations and we do not regret it.  Check-in was swift and friendly (thanks to Alexandro and Rafael at the front desk!). The suite in Bungalow J-3 was nice and clean with...one shortcoming - poor water pressure (hopefully temporary). Food was simple but fresh and we enjoyed breakfast omelets served with freshly baked bread and excellent coffee (thank you Jose).  Lunch and dinner looked alike but on Valentines Day, the buffet looked amazing! Fried chicken, pork and beef were served hot and no shortage of salads, vegetables and sweets (my favorite was caramel pudding). We've got what we've paid for: unbeatable weather with wonderful non-crowded beach, mountain scenery, warm and crystal-clear water.;3
Dated resort but for the price it was good.   Buffet was definitely too small for the amount of people and selection wasnt great but I'm not picky, there is always something.  Grounds as most were well kept. And very interesting has lots of character! It used to be 4 resorts that amalgamated. Lots of photo opts.   It was over an hr to get to the resort from the airport. Wasnt a fan of that. Also no slushie drinks and constantly running out of ice.   Beach has lots of locals as it is a public beach. Pools were not in the best shape. And rooms were very dated however very large but no dresser. Wifi for $  I had a great time with my family and there was a lot of return guests however I wont be one of them. Thanks for the hospitality Club Amigo;3
This is a typical Cuban resort only made better by the great workers and bartenders at the resort. The rooms are basic but clean, you do need water shoes for the sea the pool is good. The pool bar is the most fun place, Francisco, Ivan, Dennis, Jorge and Santos are the best bartenders. They make the best drinks and are always laughing and making jokes, they really make you feel welcome and glad to see you.  The food at the buffet was ok but never hot so it kind of lost its flavor because of it.  I am not a fan of cold pork beef and chicken and a big disappointment when they had very little fresh fruit, that I really missed. They do seem to have more senior citizens then anyone else. It would have to be a really really cheap price for me to return.;3
Hi everyone, I spent a week at the Club Amigo Carisol LosCorales and here is my review. I booked this trip leaving from Montreal through VoyagesBergeron for 1015.00$ Canadian in single occupancy from December 25th in their premium bungalow. The checking in part was fast and in a few minutes I was in my room B3. This room was dated definitely in need of love, paint flaking off the wall, curtain pole was broken, but the view was a beach view. Prior to booking I had looked at a picture which looked real nice and I guess my expectation would have been of that equivalent since I had paid a premium. I forgot to mention that when I checked in I asked for a security safe and I was told to come back later which I did. I paid her 14 CUCs and she told me that someone would come by to set;3
We came to Club Amigo February 19 2020 with our Family of 5. The hotel staff was amazing,  made sure we were happy and had what we all needed at all times.  The pools were amazing,  my kids loved loved it! The beach was just beautiful! The views I cant even put into words!  A must see! The food was good, my kids ate everything! We will be back! Ty staff for all yur hard work King family;5
The staff were all amazing, drinks were good, rooms clean and nice, a large selection of food, cute beach. Water is drinkable can’t wait to go back. Favourite spot to be was the water bar, bar tenders were the best. Landscaping was so beautiful as well.;5
I booked last minute at an amazing (unbelievable) rate. I understand the resort only gets $100 per week from the fare to look after you. I usually travel 4 or 5 star, so when I arrived and saw my room my heart sank. I got a partially renovated room on the 2nd fl (requested 1st floor), nothing in the little old frig, no bottled water or coffee/tea maker. Given two beds instead of the one king requested. Damaged but functional fixtures. A funky hard mattress. Old safe you need to pay for. You actually get a real key, don't lose it, there may not be a copy.  So here I was, in a 3-star resort, that may have 3-star facilities, but is quite run down and in disrepair and I would have pegged it at 2.5 star. I planned on moving to another resort and paying again for the week elsewhere,;3
This is actually 2 resorts put together. When we arrived they put us in the Carisol resort and the room was quite desperate. I don't think we have ever stayed in a room that dire before. The room and the resort are in much need of repair. Thankfully, we got moved over to the Corales part and had a nice room ground floor in the 500 Block across from the pool, and we quite enjoyed our stay there. As another regular patron told me, tipping goes a long way. The pool is a bit on the cool side but once you get in it is quite nice. The only downfall to the pool is those folks that sit at the swim-up bar all afternoon or all day and don't get out to use the washroom. It's quite evident when you are also sitting by the pool for the afternoon. This is not the fault of the resort but is;3
A little background! I'll be 82 in March. A Cubanadian since 1988 when Cuba discovered us. Been around the Caribbean and happiest here.Traveled all of Cuba except for the Vinales.Solo for 5 years now.  A little resorts 101  Most resorts don't get much more than 100 Canadian dollars a week per tourista.So when the tour operators cry poor think again.Like to see some of you cope with feeding, watering and securing travelers with that munificent amount.  I read the reviews on a daily basis and see that the same things crop up again and again. The blame game for false advertising and air brushed brochures. Amenities that don't exist or aren't available.Crisis maintenance.All of this reflects on the  resorts.It's the tour operators NOT them!!!  We arrived Dec. 24th to Carisol Corales;3
Staff was wonderful. They certainly went beyond what was expected to make the trip good.  Lots to do.  Pool was too cold for me but I enjoyed the sun.  Wish they had diet pop.  I am not to have sugar so I struggled with drinks.  Food was ok.  Seemed to be a shortage..  We went uptown and had more wonderful experiences.;3
Yesterday we have just arrived from Cuba. We have been to Santiago de Cuba at Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales. This place is a charm at its best for us. We love everything there...the ocean, air, people...We feel great love, respect, and gratitude for all managers and employees of the resort. We hope to see everyone who took care of us this year next year as well and sincerely wish wellness and well-being to them!  Olga and Svetlana;4
We have just returned from our 8th visit to Los Corales. As previously mentioned, this is a three star resort, but they always manage to provide us with a 5 star vacation. The staff is amazing! Marleidis, in the front office is the best! She will do everything possible to make your stay comfortable, the bartenders, Francisco and his crew go over and above to keep the drinks flowing, entertainment staff has lots going on daily - Spanish lessons, Salsa lessons, bingo, volleyball on the beach, drink making classes at the pool - thanks Leo - there is lots to do if you choose to do so. The groundskeepers do a great job keeping the property looking it’s best - housekeeping always came through when there was an issue.  Admittedly, this resort won’t be for everyone, but for our group;5
Visited the resort in late December, I had a great experience and would definitely come back!  This is a 3 star resort in Cuba, so don't expect a luxury and fancy crowd - and you won't be disappointed.  The weather was super hot, the staff was amazing, evening shows at high notch, room was renovated and clean (stayed at Corales side) , the food was repeatable (but many options to choose from- great pizza, fish etc ), beach area clean and plenty of chairs - no need to reserve. Beautiful mountain views from the beach  -also great snorkeling right from the beach! Never stayed by the pool (too loud for me because of the music but it looked clean and wasn't crowded).  The airport transfer was fast and efficient - beautiful scenic drive (I traveled with sunwing).;5
This was our 5th visit to Los Corales. Had an amazing time. Our room was clean, had fresh coat of paint and comfy. There are clearly shortages on the island but I ate 3 square meals a day and never lacked anything to drink alcoholic or otherwise. The staff are amazing, and one of our main reasons for returning. Spent our mornings at the beach and afternoons by the pool. Weather is always perfect. We will go back.;4
"I am in Carisol Los Corales now… Unfortunately. Stay away ! Stay away ! Stay away! According to Cuban low, it is prohibited to rent accommodation to tourists without hot and cold water. It took three days to me to get hot water in my room. Then we (not only me but many tourists) start experience sporadic disconnection of cold and hot water… Cuba is a tropical country. If you cannot flash a toilet it becomes a grate trouble. As a conclusion: this hotel is running illegal business!  Selling this “packages” Canadian companies participate in illegal business! Shame on Canadian companies!!!  There is no sense to discuss anything else answering questions about ""evening entertainment"", etc... Hotel doe not provide ""must have"" things.";1
I’m coming back to Carisol Los Corales twice per year. I love very friendly staff they are ready to help 24 hours per day.  Hotel grounds is nicely maintained.  Bar tenders wii make the best Spanish coffee ever. Entertainment team will keep you busy all day and in the evening. Nice, clean beach with lots of palm trees. Big and clean rooms. I’ll recommend for family with kids and also for singles.;5
Family of two+3 young kids. This place is not for those looking for the luxury, yet it offers arguably one of the best values per your $. Check-in efficient but english not so. Rooms are pretty basic but for the most part updated. Nice Bathroom - bring your own toiletries including Shampoo & Conditioner. Beds comfortable, Good A/C Mini Fridge, Flat screen T.v.Keep doors and windows shut - fluded with mosquitoes, frogs, flies etc. No window screens. Dining room lacks variety, pretty much repetitive: Breakfast with eggs to your liking, pancakes, some fruits and veggies etc. Lunch consist of pork, chicken, beef, fish, shrimp (or part of the protein choice), rice&beans, potatoes, breads and desserts. Dinner offers similar variety as lunch. We had no issues with the food and always;3
Enjoyed the beach and the restaurants. We also enjoyed the Catamaran trip to the city and the tour. Awesome lobster meal was prepared for us by the chef and the bartenders were very friendly. Liked the fact that we had access to the internet via a prepaid card.;3
"Found this vacation still enjoyable but definitely the most lacking.  Been to Cuba 15 times.  Our reception was lacking, as was initial communication, and we had to be relocated. It was a struggle to receive acceptable accommodation for joining family. The food selection sparse but improved and we had to go to Corales for dinner, wifi cards, bookings; a definite concern for some.  The chefs did a wonderful job cooking and filling trays despite the constant lack of water/hydro the first 5 days, including Christmas Eve.  Proper sanitation was concerning and,despite precautions and Ducarol, all of us caught a stomach bug.  There were shortages of tableware, wifi cards, pesos, and toilet paper.   On the bright side, the staff was cheery, pleasant and willing to please with the";2
When we arrived as a family of three we were informed that there was a booking for only two people despite having receipts that said otherwise. We were put into a two person room which we were thankfully able to switch out of the next day. Many rooms were flooded and we were put in carisol, which is pretty much the overflow resort and was in significant states of disrepair.  The water was out for days at a time and there was frequent power outages. It is difficult to enjoy your meals when you know the staff have no water to prepare food or even wash their hands. At night there was no lighting making it difficult to get from place to place without a flashlight. The food was not great and the ‘gym’ was non functional.  We were not provided with water in our rooms like in most;1
Both my girlfriend and I have traveled to Cuba many times over the years. This was the first time that we have stayed in this resort. We stayed for the last 2 weeks in December. We asked for a room on the 2nd floor in the Los Corales section of the resort. The room was ok... except that the AC unit was an old wall mounted unit that was permanently on and was very noisy. All the controls had been removed. Early next morning we asked at reception for another room. They said they would check with the maids and that we should come back in a few hours. We did that and we got the same response. However, eventually we got a better room with a modern quiet AC unit.  Overall the staff were good, especially in the restaurants and bars. Our maid (Maleides) was amazing. She kept our room;2
"This was my second visit to this property, since 7 years ago. The buildings are old and in disrepair. The roof is leaking in many places, so if you happen to be on the second floor, have a bucket ready in case it rains. I had a leak, fortunately it rained only one day, on the 24 of Dec..Any repair you will need takes time; be persistent, but polite.  The lagune at the hotel entrance is very dirty, with garbage floating on. Realy an eye sore for the hotel. I noticed it when arrived at the hotel. I found the food to be quite good and tasty. The chef and the restaurant manager desere credit. They are very well organized. The buffet is well stocked and frequently replenished with small portions.  The stuff is pleasant and accommodating. The gym is dysfunctional. The machines are";3
Visited the last week of December, this was our 4th visit, didn't go last year but decided to go back because we knew the staff and returning clients.  Where to start?   No water on the resort, no water to flush toilet, no water to wash your hands, just no water, Dec 24, no water for 24 hours straight.  Then the rest of the week, no water during big chunks of the days.   We heard many different stories from the hotel staff but never the same so all lies if you ask me.  Some electricity issues as well, couple of days where power was up and down,  By Dec 26 or 27th, everyone we talked had at least one person in their family that had full diarrhea, add the fact that you have no running water and can't wash your hands or flush your toilet, or can't use the public toilet as they had;1
"We stayed last week of December. We were here years ago but quality has really gone downhill. It hasn’t been maintained, the rooms were horrible. I know it’s a budget accommodation, I get that, but you should expect the basics like ac, hot water, and safety.   The negatives: Our room never had hot water, despite repeat requests. Our neighbours didn’t have ac. Our fridge didn’t work. The balcony door doesn’t have a lock; just a piece of wood to keep the door shut.   The pillow was small and smelled liked it was really old. The bed had no springs; my back is still sore. The rooms have two twin beds not a queen or king bed. They are fixed to the ground so you can’t move them side by side. The bottom of the pool was wobbly - the liner needs to be changed but I guess they don’t have";2
My family stayed at this resort in the last week of December 2019. The main problem we had with this resort is that they have a big problem with Water. We have been to other resorts in Cuba before and so do not expect much before the trip. However, water was never a problem in the other resorts. For about 4 days in the week we stayed, there was no hot water. The worst of all, frequently, there was NO water at all! One day I could no take a shower until very late in the evening after swimming in the sea in the morning!!  Will NEVER go back to this resort again. Would rather spend a bit more to go to other places, and so avoid keeping worrying whether there will be water before going our for swimming.;2
Los Corales is my go to destination in December, because I want it to be warm and sunny and this area never disappoints. My main activity is snorkelling, and again, I am certain to be able to enjoy it every day here, due to the protective reef which blocks the rough water on windy days.  My room was in a great location, close to everything with a nice view and a large balcony. The maid kept things clean, everything worked, lots of hot water and water pressure, and the bed was comfortable.   The buffet was good at breakfast, and the cook at the egg station was fast and efficient. At lunchtime I enjoyed tasty pizza, and the a la carte had perfectly cooked fish and good service. Coffee was available as early as I liked. The lobby bar could be busy and smokey, especially in the;4
After 10 visits at my favorite resort, I am now looking for a different hotel. I fell in love with that hotel mainly because of the quality of the cuban music and animation but my last two visits have left me very desapointed. There is hardly any music at all when before they use to have it at lunch and dinner everyday. They go as far as doing bingo for evening entertainment!! The staff is still very nice and friendly and the rooms clean. The beach very average(wear shoes). If you go to Cuba for the music like I do, forget it.  They have cut down on their strongest asset which is too bad.;3
End of November trip, I travelled from Montreal directly to Santiago, The check in by Sunwing was excellent. Very quick, helpful, and efficient. The cabin crew was excellent too. The Santiago airport was excellent. Getting into the bus was quick and efficient, Sunwing reps (Kenia and Barbaro) were on site and run the show very good. The bus trip took 1 hr, it is great scenic route. There is a bar close by, so get at least some liquid supply for the trip. On the way back, the bar had water only.  Accommodation: I stayed in the cabana A4. Good bathroom, spacy room. The maid service was excellent. Good TV reception. The new A/C unit could not be controlled, always set to 19, so if it is too cold the power cord is on the right by patio door.   Food: The food was very good. At that;4
Last minute vacation. This resort is 2/3*. For what we paid it’s what we expected. Food is just ok. Not much variety. Stayed on the corales side in a jr suite. Room was spacious and had what we needed but very basic. Staff was accommodating in helping us with any of our needs. Drinks were good. Not a lot of entertainment at night. We enjoyed the bingo and kids enjoyed volleyball. Small resort but the best thing was the ability to use the water accessories as we pleased due to not being loaded with ppl. Water shoes are a must. Not a pristine beach but pristine views. We made the most of it and enjoyed what we had. Sadly two out of the 7 of us got violently ill the last two days as well As many other travellers heading home on our plane. Much thanks to the young women in;3
We have traveled all over the island, all different resorts. But after Corales los carisol, we were hooked. The best people,  both staff an locals. We are heading back for Christmas.  3 star, with 5 star employmee's.;5
Half of the rooms were condemned.  Another quarter of rooms should have been.  First room we had no doors on closet or safe. No shower head on shower, toilet seat not bolted down, sliding patio door broken, and wide open crakes in main door that could looked through from inside as well as outside.  Se ond room wide cracks duck tapped.  Only one key available per room. Only nice staff in whole place was the excellent poolbar staff.  Waitstaff in the main restraunt were lazy and never smiled.  There where twin boys that worked there that where the only ones who did all the work.. All the other ones constantly ordered them both around.  This was our first and definitely our last.  Management also in very hard training on how to customer service perfessionally.;1
I stayed here from May 3-17th for the second time and had a wonderful experience-  It is a quieter resort but I do have to say that the staff there work exceptionally hard to do a fantastic job with keeping their customers happy and occupied. During the day they are always running various activities around the resort, and every night at 930 there is a show.   Julio and Leonys: I am specifically talking about these two enterainers as I noticed from the first time I came to this resort in February that they were always going above and beyond with their work regardless of the time of day. These two are also the best MCs for the nightly shows in my opinion! They maintain a very strong work ethic as they are always willing to do more than what is asked of them, help others whether;4
Uneventful air transat flights coming and going. However, upon arrival, within 24 hours , air trans reneged on their resort and flight contracts and tried to cut my holiday short, not to mention cancelling reservations pending to shove people through Holguin. I had taken trip cancellation and interruption insurance suspecting them to try and pull a fast one. Unfortunately other long term guests were told if they stayed they’d have to pay to get to Holguin out of their pockets. Most of us left April 10th.Time for a passengers’ bill of rights in Canada with teeth. Sunwing had closed out March 27th.     Lucked in with food supplies. 26 out of the 28 days had ample fruits, meats and wine, bread, excellent fish etc.. Pasta and pizza bar functioned well at noon daily except closed;3
We needed a much needed relaxing vacation. This resort had that for us. The foliage was lush, well manicured lawns. We had the ground floor. The patio area was much bigger than anticipated. Nice to sit out there and have a nite-cap. The resort itself was wonderfully updated. Will definately be back. P.S. The coconut bar on the beach makes an awesome pina colada!!;5
I visited Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales last February. It was amazing! I loved the place, the atmosphere, the music, the food, the staff. The weather was incredible. And the price was very reasonable. The road to the city was not great, but we enjoyed our visit to Santiago very much. This is the real Cuba, not like Varadero and the keys. Amarilis the sales manager was very professional and very nice.;5
1 week wasn’t enough.  Breakfast grill is fresh and amazing fruit.  Coffee at the lobby bar. A morning walk to the other hotel to try out the coffee bar and a seat around the pool. The beach every afternoon. Tried the Cuba libra, pina colada, and cold beer. We were invited to join a 3 horse buggy caravan to a restaurant close by. It was out of this world good. We had Caribbean lobster for 2 including the ride for 30 cuc. We borrowed the resort bikes and returned to the restaurant, but it was closed on Monday. Enjoyed the ride though, all along the shore. Joined the locals horseback riding for 2 for 2 1/2 hours for 20cuc. Supper can be from the buffet or the grill. The veges and pasta, potatoe or rice are all good too. You can drink the water at this resort. That’s important for;5
Seems to be getting more run down as time goes on.  We had a day with no water at all Hot or Cold.  Seem to constantly running out of Cups for coffee etc..  It's Cuba- they do the best they can with what they have;2
We have  been here many times, always in February and the weather has never disappointed. The staff are all excellent, and try their hardest to please the clientele.  The hotel continues to make improvements, slowly but surely. I really like the beach because of the huge sandy area that has so many trees, making shade readily available. The chairs are managed well too. There was a large variety of food, and we found it to be quite good. The kitchen staff are really trying hard. Lots of delicious ice cream. Having hand made pizza and pasta at noon right beside the buffet area works well and is a nice option. It would be great if they could update the rooms at a faster pace. Regardless, we will return.;3
My daughter, grandson and myself stayed for a week at this resort, and loved it. There are a few ''faults'' that could be found, if one were the kind of person who went looking for them, but we are NOT.  We loved our room, an upper floor ( although NOT the handiest thing with a walker that had to be carried up and down by my long suffering, but uncomplaining, daughter, several times a day!) of an ocean view bungalow, with a huge balcony, and a beautiful view of the ocean and mountains, an excellent digitally controlled air conditioner, reasonably comfortable beds,spotless sheets and (lots of) clean white towels. We always had plenty of hot water, the shower worked well, and our very pleasant maid did a great job of keeping the whole place clean. The food was a little repetitive,;4
We have just finished our seventh visit to Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales. We were happy to note that the food has steadily improved and this visit January 30-February 13 was the best yet. For those of you who had the worst trip ever and the worst food ever, etc., etc., etc., if you are looking for five star food and service then pay the big bucks and go somewhere else.  We have met people that have been going to this resort for over twenty years. Some stay for one, two or three months. We have travelled to most areas of Cuba prior to coming to Santiago. Yes, we have had better facilities, beaches, etc. at some of the resorts in Varadero, Holguin and Guardelvaca and others were similar to Los Corales.  Some of you forget that you are in Cuba where many things are in short supply;4
Who we are: older couple mid to late 70s, well traveled in Cuba at many different hotels in different Cuban provinces.  Mostly three-star  hotels, we are very budget minded.    STAYED AT CARISOL LOS CORALES SANTIAGO DE CUBA from February 11th – 18th, 2019.  Stayed one week.  Resided at the Corales side.  FOOD was better this year than last year and we had no problem getting something good to eat at any meal.  We were usually in the first flush of guests to eat at all meals.  Very good waitstaff at all times, wine with lunch and dinner.  DRINKS were pretty good as well, service was excellent at all of the bars.  We usually had our before and after dinner drinks at the lobby bar and enjoyed the atmosphere there.  During the day the pool bar was where we would have a nice cold beer;4
Just returned from 2 weeks at Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales.  My wife and I enjoyed our stay.   The food is repetitive but was adequate for our needs.  We did not get sick from the food.  There are some shortages such as bacon in the morning and variety of fruit.  Some of our favorite staff have moved on to other hotels in the city possibly due to the length of time the resort is open.   The rooms need some updating.   We had some problems with our air conditioner as we could not control the temperature.   We were not able to change rooms during the first week of our stay which was inconvenient.  We did not get the room we had asked for.    There is little to no food taken out of the buffet restaurant this year by both the tourists or Cubans staying at the resort.  This is due;4
We have been to Cuba 12 times and fully understand the economic profile of the country. We are usually very patient and have never made a complaint about any of the resorts........until now. The Carisol los Corales on the Club Amigo side needs to be investigated and shut down. So many lies on their webside it's hard to decide where to begin. First of all the resort is not a 3 star... It barely makes a 2. It is not 1/2 an hour from the airport... It's over an hour (depending how much livestock is on the road). The food at this resort is the same every day ! Some of the staff are nice...the rest act like they hate their jobs. No phones in the rooms. No smoke detector or wall lights in our room. My daughter was verbally assaulted on 2 accounts..My wife both verbally and physically;1
Vacation for 2 weeks in Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales in Santiago De Cuba , Feb. 13 / feb 27/ 2019, with Sunwing Air Lines, 4 hour flight.  to Antonio Maceo Airport, with another friend of us, 4 persons. At the airport our names were not on list and they didn.t know which bus to take us to the hotel. One hour with the bus , winding roads, potholes, and Siesta Mountains views. At the Hotel didn.t have our 4 names written. I was in #108 and friend in #413 far away from us. When booked trip asked agensy for top 2nd floor got low first floor, close to sewers smell,clothes closet with broken glass, tape on door and floor tiles, hard to open shower glass doors, on our lower first floor. Next door, two men loud noise all the time could not sleep, told front desk. When had to leave to;3
hello,first to tell you that  I had a very bad experience on Valentine's Day February 14, after seeing 50 kilometers driven from the city of Santiago de Cuba to the hotel Carisol los Corales, we were treated super bad, not a glass of water they offered us, the  hotel carpet(man) who worked there that day with very bad attitude and very reluctantly recieved us saying that we were very badly informed about the offers, that day it rained and we had to turn back without anything, we asked about staying without offers, about paying at the real cost of 140 cuc and he still told us that there was no capacity and they words was the worst in the world,it was like he has to much stres ,like he don't like work there ,we are a couple who have traveled the entire Asian continent and never;1
Returned from 1 week at Los Corales..........another perfect trip!  This time, there were 9 of us travelling to this resort - 4 newbies!  Had a fantastic trip.  The weather was incredible - rained for 10 minutes one nite around 9:00 pm - otherwise beautiful sunny skies. The staff at this hotel are just wonderful.  The front desk staff are always extremely helpful, maids keep the rooms clean, baristas make the most amazing cappuccinos.............and always with a smile! The entertainment staff are really good - a lot of new, young staff.  Also noticed many changes in the buffet, as well. Many of the staff who were around for years have moved to another hotel - many new faces. Just as bright and cheery as the last bunch! Osmaris and Lily are just great - always smiling and so;5
"Resently me and my friend came back from Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales. With the weather like this in Toronto we would just right now come back there with a pleasure and stay there as long as possible ..     On the Eve of the Valentine's Day we would love to wish health, joy and love to everyone who is on vacation there and to all the employees of the resort who took care of us for two charming weeks. All of them, in a harmony with a nature of this wonderful island and thankfully to their professional skills, optimism and kindheartedness, gave us an opportunity to relax, rejuvenate and get healthier    We would like to bring personal thanks to managers Amarilis, Alehandro, Lissette, Angelo, Merladys and others; to barmens and waiters, especially Elias, Reinaldo, Natalie, Adis";5
Rooms were clean, housekeepers did a great job at keeping our room spotless. Food was tasty but got me sick! The entertainment staff were amazing though, they made the trip so memorable, would go back again just to see them! Beach was nice, not super white sand like Varadero but still way better than Canada! Weather was great!;3
First, nothing to do with the airline, but the airport at Santiago is a passenger management disaster. It took a long time to get through an airport that gets very few flights per day. We were caught in a very frustrating people jam between immigration and the very slow screening of bags through security. Only Cuba scans your bags again on arrival even though the scanning has already been done at departure.   Re the Carisol/Corales resort if you're OK with one kind of soup for lunch and dinner every day, the same meager breakfast every day, no food at the all day snack bar, running out of wine twice at dinner, no running water twice during the week, running out of internet cards or no change when buying them, then this is the place for you. Nothing to do with the staff who tried;2
This resort is about 1 hr from the city of Santiago. My room was on the upper floor near the pool, it was kept spotless , the air conditioner worked and plenty of hot water. The beach is not like the beach in Varadero, rocky, seaweed and urchins . It was still very pleasant sitting along the beach . The pool was very clean and quite refreshing . The other part of the resort also had a huge, clean pool. I went on the catamaran excursion to Santiago , snorkeling and lunch and a quick tour in the city . Jorge will hook you up with that - very reasonable at 70 CUC. I also went to Castro’ s grave and saw the changing of the guard . Very impressive. All bartenders were awesome, drinks ( Bahama Mama and Pina Colada ), ice cold cervaza as well as coffee were good . The entertainment in;3
The hotel is pretty standard for a three star hotel. The beach is great with lots of trees to sit under. Rooms were older but clean. The service at the buffet restaurant is very poor, but they don't seem to mind if you get your own water from the jug. It was much better at the el a cart restaurant. They didn't always have silverware or glasses on the tables. They had lots of variety of food but seemed to start running out of stuff by the end of our one week stay, such as butter, eggs, ice cream. The pineapple and mango juice was delicious, as well as the bread. There is a small area of the beach that was good for snorkeling but it seemed dangerous to go out to the reef area. They said we could pay for an excursion for snorkeling but the boat was never available and very;3
"What's good about this resort?   Housekeeping does an excellent job of keeping the rooms clean.  Service people at the resort, in general, try very hard to help their guests.  What's not good?  Most everything else.  We were there 6 days and in that time had no running water (so no toilets working) throughout the entire resort for 3-4 hours.  Within those same 6 days we were without electricity for a number of hours.  We were a group with 6 rooms.  TVs sometimes worked and most often did not.  A/C was intermittent.  Restaurant food was limited and always the same with very little ""fresh vegetables or fruit"".  Beds are not comfortable. Overall the resort was a disappointment.";2
I visited club amigo los Corrales with my daughter on January 17 to 23rd. I have been to this hotel before and kind of knew what to expect.  All my expectations were exceeded.  The hotel staff and the entertainment were fantastic.  We mingled with the Locals and my daughter made a lot of friends.  Homero and Jesus took a real liking to us and made our vacation fantastic, made us feel like family.  My recommendation is to get involved with the staff and enjoy these wonderful people and they will treat you like family.  Weather in Baconao region is absolutely amazing.  There is no hit or miss here, whole week it was sunny 30°C.  Lots to see and lots to do in the area.  Old castle in Santiago, swim with Dolphins, Jeep Safari, horse riding?  They have it all.  Too many people to;5
This resort is small and when we went they had half of resort closed  Very outdated rooms but clean ... a/c worked good - always hot water  The down fall for us was not very clean within the resort - lacked entertainment, dirty cups , and the wipe everything with dirty towels  Food was bad ... cold always ,, breakfast was the best and the pizza the serve just out the the buffet ... the locals would be on beach early morning asking for clothes or money - we meet a nice Cuban family exchanged some clothes and some money very very grateful ppl , the guy even made a grasshopper & hat for my son in return  But later in day more local begging for clothes off your back and being very rude about it ... be aware !!! Not all like this thro .  the best part of the whole vacation was the;3
This was my second visit to Los Corales obviously I enjoyed it or I would not have returned I have been to Cuba many times.I did a review April/18 therefore I will not make this one as long conditions and food were the same (excellent).I liked it so much the first time this time I stayed for 4 weeks. What a fantastic get away. Sunwing flight both way was satisfactory. Sunwing rep Barbaro at the resort was helpful. Reception was quick upon arrival. Food-Very,very good, lots to chose from, presentation was eye catching, waiters quite obliging, good service. Beach-Many palapas and also lots of shady spots under the trees if one so choses. The ocean was quite warm most days but I do recommend water shoes. Very few mosquitoes during the month and only 2 five minute rain showers.Also;5
Just returned from a 2week vacation to this twin hotel and to its standards it was ok.Thank goodness we stayed at Corales which is the more quieter of the 2 resorts.Nice staff and issues with amenities were dealt with in a typical Cuban way-slowly,but ok.overall this resort could use some upgrading,but it was survivable.Food was good and plenty,rooms were cleaned everyday ,but it is a 2-3 star hotel.We would return again if one issue could be resolved.There were a lot of Cuban guests on hand and the resort obviously caters to them as preference.All the others of us were second handed and ignored...not a very good way to treat paying customers!,,,,,,all together we had a great time otherwise and made new friends .;4
First time in Cuba. Based on the stories told, I expected much worst. Turned out to be a great trip. Rooms are average but the food was more then acceptable. Had a lot of fun. Would definitely go back. Hotel May have been 3 star but the people and experience was 5 star.;3
"I've been to Cuba before, and thought I knew what to expect of a 3-star resort there. I stayed at the Los Corales side of this dual property and almost cried the first night, it was such a disappointment. When we got to our room the mini fridge, the A/C and the telephone were not plugged in and the staff member didn't know where the plug was for the fridge or how to turn on the A/C. But the biggest issue of the night was the safe in our room, it did not work and we refused to accept that they could not fix it. The lazy staff member first tried to say it needed batteries and he didn't have any, then that the door needed a ""technician"" to fix it and he couldn't come until tomorrow, then when we demanded a new room with a safe that did work he said the place was full and there were";2
Very lovely twin resorts Corales & Carisol in the Parque de Bocanoa Reserve. The two resorts are a 150 M apart and you are welcome to enjoy both sections. Stayed in an ocean view Jr. Suite in the Carisol section. Bungalows in Corales section looked very nice too. Meals were adequate and service was very good. Staff are friendly, attentive and quite prompt in their service. There is a restaurant/disco that is between the two resorts which is quite the place to be till 2 am. Beach has seaweed so water shoes are recommended. Was fun using the complimentary kayaks and easy to navigate within the reef boundary. Lovely views of the mountains once you are a bit away from the beach. I was there over Christmas and the X'Mas Eve dinner was a special treat. Area outside the Corales resort;4
"Just back from our 3rd/2 week stay at Los Corales for 2018 and have booked for February 2019.  Once we are off the bus and checked in (always super efficient with Alejandro there)... it is a quick change into our suits and off to visit Francisco & Ivan at the pool bar for a catch-up chat & cold bevy! If you are lucky, you will get the extra special Francisco ""Uber"" delivery of your drink. (Just can't say enough about this dynamic team...) Early morning coffee runs are up at the Daquari Bar to see Elian or Fernando ( they make the best Cappuccinos) or up to the Lobby Bar for one of Julios! Best way to start the day is   Lily or Omaris on the egg station ( best omelettes ever). Omaris also creates the best Pizza for a quick lunch on the patio beside the buffet if you aren't too";3
It was a great way to spend my 30th anniversary traveling Cuba! As a repeat visitor to Carisol Corales during the opening shakedown I was well taken care of at Corales as Carisol was not open. Many thanks to all in this great solid 3 star A.I.  I booked my flight through Flighthub at a substantially reduced rate from Sunwing. Really don’t understand how same plane, same flight could be 30% cheaper than Sunwing direct. Well taken care of by Sunwing customer service and special services. Direct non stop trip going. Supposed to be stop coming back [ not unexpected because they always sell non stop and then change it ] but we left earlier and had a non stop return and actually arrived early. Always expect the unexpected! Lol.  Weather 21 days of sunshine and 20 minutes of rain.;3
We are a family that just got back from Club Amigo Carisol-Los Corales. We stayed for two weeks from Dec. 5-19. Before we left we read lots of reviews and we were happy to find out that most of those negative reviews have no merit. Well, let me start with the coffee, which is very important to lots of people, including me. I appreciate good quality coffee, and I don’t believe that Tim Horton’s, Starbucks, or McDonald’s coffee is good quality coffee, so if you are expecting this kind of coffee, you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for good coffee, cappuccino, or espresso, made with coffee grown and processed in Cuba, then you will be pleasantly surprised. All bars are using the same coffee machines and every bartender makes it slightly different. My favorite coffee;5
It looks like I visit this hotel every 2 years, so after 2 years, I travelled from Montreal to this place, The check in by Sunwing was excellent. Very quick, helpful, and efficient. The cabin crew was excellent too. There was a stop over in Manzanillo, which was a bit extended because some tourists were late. The Santiago airport was excellent. Very good experience after Manzanillo. Getting into the bus was quick and efficient, Sunwing reps (Kenia and Barbaro) were on site and run the show very good. The bus trip took 1 hrs., it is great scenic route. There is a bar close by, so get at least some liquid supply for the trip.  Accommodation: I stayed in the cabana C1. Good A/C, good bathroom, but shower head needs to be replaced. The maid service was excellent. Good TV reception.;4
Hello - my review is a little late, originally wasn't going to waste my time that's how put off we were. We are Cuba veterans so we know what's ahead. We changed rooms twice' made no difference all unacceptable.  Never since 1994 (my 13th trip) have I had a room with no dressers - No counter space in the bathroom, next to no closet space etc etc - I think us get the idea. The first 2 days the food was a disgrace I survived on fresh omelets in the morning. Very hard to try to eat with endless stray dogs & cats hoping for a piece of food. No attempt by the staff to get rid of them. Flies & mosquitos ----- we were told worst infestation in over 20 years my legs looked like I had a disease, used OFF all day To no avail. Lobby bar the smallest I've ever seen, service was great if u;1
This is not a Hotel , it is more a camping  site than a real hotel , no fresh water in rooms, two Days with no water , very poor variaty of drinks , food was terrible , I had to pay ( under the table to get some  pizza for my nephews because they did not like anything from restaurant ,security agents are not professionals and treat guests very bad , check in was slow, they have so many scheduales in Bars that you never know which one is open , it looks like a school, lifeguards are always working in the Bars instead of been taking care of guests in the pool, Do not go to this hotel or I do guarantee you will have a terrible vacation.;1
FLIGHT. I flew to Holguin by Transat. Huge relief when it was over. One has to be four feet tall or shorter to fly like a human, not like anchovy in a can. Many firms are shamelessly greedy packing people like animals, but this Transat is the champion among them. Be as short and tiny as possible, while dealing with them. TRANSFER. My transfer from Holguin to the hotel had left without me. I had to take a taxi from Holguin. It is 200km and $150 by horrible wreckage-car. I finally arrived to the hotel at 4 AM, and being not exactly happy. NOISE. They put me in a room with windows looking at the pool. It was OK until “entertainment” people start yelling through an amplifier on those in the pool at 10 AM. So, I could not hear nothing in the room, like TV. Almost all clients of this;3
It was our second stay at Club Amigo Carisol. This time we upgraded the accommodation to the Oceanview bungalow and that was the best decision we could make. Bungalow 4 (1st floor) was quiet, clean, very close to the beach (but not right in front of it - so great view of the ocean and the sunsets). Food - meh, but we didn't care much, as long as they had something fresh sizzling on the grill for lunch and dinner. Twice we ordered lobster and fried fish from the locals (Leo) - definitely, we took the risk, but the food was delicious, fresh and worth every penny (lobster CUC25, fish CUC15) and it was delivered  to the balcony ! we might come back.;5
Sparkling clear oceans, soft breezes, good food and accommodation! What more could you ask for? And a reasonable price! Lol. Spent 19 days snorkeling the calm waters at this time of year and even did the cliffs at Carisol. Not quite a 100 per cent from my surgery but more than enough to do 2x daily with my little fishies.  Spotted my 1st ray there just the size of my the palm of my hand, at least 4 different eels from ruffled lavender , black and yellow ruffled, 2 black, yellow spotted and a small dark purple one tucked in the coral. A pair of porcupine fish, needle nosers, flying gungeons, surgeon,  5 lion fish, innumerable sergeant majors, rock beauties, damsels, one trunk fish and so many more. Next time over the reef with the dive master Ernesto and the dive boat.   Ernesto;4
This was our very first trip to Cuba.  We went with friends here had a great time.  The food was good, lots for every meal.  The Italian restaurant served great pasta and pizza.  The bread is amazing there and they make the greatest hot dogs at the disco.  The staff are great here and the service was always good.  The only issue we had was with our room we ended up being moved to another room 2 days after we got there.  A great country and wonderful people.  We will definitely return to this resort next year again.;3
Los Corales is a small but adorable hotel . I’ve been there many times with my family because the staff is so friendly & sweet , always accommodating & fun to hang around with.  The hotel is right on the beach , which has warm crystal blue water , lots of sun beds & huts to get shade. Beach towels & massages are available there too. Rent a catamaran or pedal boat too  The food is very basic , bland & tends to be the same most days. So bring spices & extra food especially if you have kids .  They do offer pizza & pastas with are surprisingly yummy.  The pool is huge & there’s a kiddie pool too. The swim up bar has a fantastic bartender named Francesco. We loved his sense of humour .  The guys who run the activities are Leo, Homero & Julio were amazing !! Always fun & available;4
Been to Cuba many times arriving at Carisol/Corales early A.M. for the first time,check in quick. On to the room. The ocean view bungalow was a good size. The room was kept clean, sheets and towels clean. Had constant hot water and strong air conditioning. When I sat on the balcony in the mornings I presume it was the farmers from surrounding farms riding the horses on the beach usually followed by a number of goats. It was quite cute and added to the ombience of being in the country. They never entered the resort property as the beach is entirely fenced. There are a few dogs and cats on the resort which the tourists appeared to enjoy.  The presentation  of the food at the buffet is eye catching. There is a large amount of food and plenty of variety. There is no shortage of food;5
I will be brief.  And this is based on my own experience.  Take it for what it's worth.  Keep in mind I am NOT a picky guest, been to Cuba many times before (and elsewhere) and I understand that this hotel cannot be compared to a 5 star hotel.  The Room:  We had a bungalow ocean view.  The room was spacious, great view of the ocean, air conditioner was amazing!  The beds would relatively comfortable.  The negatives:  the bedding and towels are badly stained. Housekeeping said that they are having trouble with the laundry machines. It is not just the odd towel that is dirty, but every one of them.  And I am talking about badly stained.  Bedding too, stained, hairs everywhere.  Since they cannot fix it, just go it and not look.  Dont pull the blankets down to inspect.  Just close;2
My wife, two youngest sons (11 and 14) and I visited Club Amigo Los Corales April 1 to 5 for a handful of coins. Stayed in rooms 410 and 511. 5 stars do not suffice considering everything. We all thoroughly loved this place.  Amazing location, decent food, clean place, great people, weather was perfect and the ocean was amazing. Not one second of boredom here! No issue with tips being requested by the staff. Not the case at the airport  nor from the band members, though…. (disliked the band very much! Much too loud for the small area, bum beer and tips from you… but that’s another story!)  The food is typical Cuban fare, not amazing but decent (expect for the smoked ham which was just incredible!!). The drinks are also local Cuban drinks, not too shabby, few top shelf brands but;5
wow the animation was excellent i liked the view of the beach and it was very quiet! At the pool he had a lot of life with Julio,Homero,Ray,Leo and the two girls! And the show at evening it's so nice!! Just WOW!!;5
We stayed at this resort for 8 days. 6 of us in total. The bus ride is an hour from the airport which was comfortable and informative from the rep on the bus telling us information about the province. Upon arrival check in was. Quick. There was 4 bus loads of us that arrived. Our rooms were ready when we arrived. The staff here is amazing. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. We had a few hiccups and they were taken care of right away. The pool is huge and never crowded. Always chairs at the pool and beach. The beach is a bit rocky and if you are an ocean swimmer I would recommend water shoes as the sand is rocky in the water as well. The beach was always clean and has a fantastic view of the mountains. The food was ok same anywhere in Cuba I find. We didn't starve. Lobster;4
Firstly, let me start by saying that this is the 13th different resort in Cuba we have stayed at. We have a breadth of experience staying at 5, 4, 3 and 2 star resorts, we have tried them all. So, I will try to share what we learned about this resort, and how you may benefit from our review.  Located at the very southern tip of Cuba, Los Corales is actually one of two resorts, Carisol is the resort joined next door but only used in the high season. Having just visited 28 Mar - 4 Apr, we were at the tail end of their season so only Corales was open, and filled 99% with Canadians.The resort is a typical 3 star Club Amigo product, with the addition of 6 unit bungalows close to the sea.  Beach - if you are a beach person, you may not be fond of this location. While the very small;3
This resort is just ok for us  I’m not a 4-5 star queen, but this resort lacked a lot of things  - not so good food, the warming table doesn’t work & food always cold BUT the breakfast is always AWESOME !!! And the PIZZA also !!!  - very out dated - cleanliness of the resort in general, not so good  - BUT the pool bar a Must & best spot for your vacation !!!! Pina Coladas were the BEST made!!!! The bartenders were the friendly people  - shortage of mugs for cappuccino almost every bar  , so do what we done buy or bring your own coffee mug 👍 - was a great place to hang out and relax with drinks but overall I wouldn’t return  Wasn’t my kinda resort , but others have different opinion- to each our own right ?!?!  Go see, judge for yourself and enjoy the pool bar cause that was our;3
"I want to post an honest review of our trip March 14th to the 28th, 2018 to Los Corales. The grounds are well looked after. Pool has very little shade Beach is rocky -  water shoes recommended Room was a good size; we had a very large balcony (where we spent most of our time) No phone, no security lock on the door , no drawers for clothes. The maid did a  very poor job cleaning; we had to ask her to sweep the floor the 3rd day. The towels are very badly stained - looks like they weren't washed (maid said they had problems with laundry). On check-in make sure you ask for beach towel ticket or you will not get a towel from the attendant at the beach. You will have a long walk back from the beach to get ticket, and back to beach to get a towel. FOOD: we have been to many resorts in";2
Bottom line: Would we go again?...yes because it was such a bargain, yet warm, friendly and nothing to complain about....... we do prefer the northern Cayos but hard to beat the price for Los Corales.  Overall: Decent accommodations, okay snorkeling and water sports but not as nice a beach as the northern areas, very isolated but with absolutely beautiful surroundings. This was two hotels separated by a walkway but the west one was closing for the season so was almost deserted.  Hotel: Older hotel with steps and uneven sidewalks but repairs and upgrades are ongoing. Beds a little hard and pillows a little small (we brought new pillows and gave them to the gardeners when we left), the air conditioner worked just fine,  no problem sleeping. Hot showers, plenty of towels and our;3
Great quiet spot. We were in a bungalow, it was clean and the balcony was large. The closet was also fairly large and the bathroom was a perfect size.  Our maid was Dalia, and she was very pleasant! I always bring a can of raid and spray down the entrance and windows when we arrive-this takes care any ant or crwly insect issues :)  Check in was fairly quick, we arrived in the evening and there was quite a bit of bustle around the lobby bar-including a live band-that made check in a little noisier than I would have liked.  The food at this resort-the buffet is just fine. Some things are repetitive, but that's ok, it's Cuba! You can get omelettes made to order along with some bacon. There are always hotcakes and sausages as well. Instead of maple syrup (which they did have some;4
My wife and I were at this resort February 21 to March 7.   We have been there over 6 times.  Each time there, the resort seems to have more problems.  On the positive side, the staff are excellent.  We did not get sick during our stay.  There were lots of beach chairs.  Wine and Crystal beer were excellent.  The buffet food was average for a 3 star resort.  The food at the specialty restaurants was mostly better.  One major problem  the hotel has is that  food is  taken out of the restaurant by the short stay Cubans.    Liquor and beer are also being taken out of the resort by the short stay Cubans.    The resort has a dog problem, dogs need to be culled.  Mosquitoes were very bad.  Had most bites ever.  Rooms full of mosquitoes.  Would we go back?  Requires some thought.;3
We are certainly coming back! It's Cuba's typical 3-4 star place with boring food and weary rooms. However the place is located in the middle of the national park. Lots of trees around, mountains, sandy beach, beautiful scenery! Friendly and helpful personnel will make your vacation a great experience.;5
Resort was nice and clean. Rooms were spacious, flat Pillows so if that's an issue bring your own. There are dogs and cats roaming around but the dogs are not strays, they live in the neighbourhood and go to the resort to get fed from the tourists. Food was ok, some days better than others but you won't starve. They are short on things like glassware and cutlery, staff seems overworked so be patient. Nice pool, beach was nice and no problem finding a lounger no matter what time it was.;3
We booked the trip from 25 th. Jan. for 7 days at Club Amigo Carisol y Corales.Our plane Cubana Air broke down(Landing Gear)   Luckily on the ground not in the middle of the air. WE should  have left Toronto 25 Jan at 12.55 pm but after waiting 15 hours we finally left at 4.00AM.  WE  arrived next day at 11.30.Majority of people who were choosing this resort were well over 60 years old . Some were coming from Sarnia,Cambridge or other town. For them it was not 15 hours. They have to drive to the airport.All of us were VERY tired.  Resort is very nice.Beautiful gardens.We stayed at the bungalow with the ocean view. Nothing to complain.I belive they were newly renovated. Food has improved since last time I was there 2010 Cuban people very nice and friendly. Cubana offer one;3
We were on the Corales side of this hotel from February 8 to 15. It is a very quiet hotel with not much around it. There was a lot of retired people and not many kids there. We also seen old  tourists (50-60's) with local youg (20's) woman since Cubans are allowed on the resort. They don't bother you, it is just weird to see. Everyone was very nice on the resort.  All the staff is VERY friendly, specially our wonderful maid Yoania and the pool barman Francisco. Our maid did everything to make us feel comfortable and Francisco always knew what we liked to drink. The beds were comfortable. The rooms and pool were very clean.  Food wasn't the best but you're in Cuba and if you bring ketchup, you'll be fine! haha! The omelets in the morning were good and we always found something to;3
I'm not going to put this place down, we had a decent holiday. The weather was perfect 13 out of 14 days. The food is average for 3-31/2 star resorts. Ala carts very good. The price was great $2500 all in for both of us.These reasons might not bother you but it was enough for us to make the decision not to return. Five dogs in the outside dinning area, people feeding them which caused the occasional dog fight right beside the table. Staff just stepped over them. We have been going to Cuba for 26 years, 1 to 3 times a year and love the Cuban people. I wish the locals had more, especially food. This resort had a daily influx of locals on 1 and 2 day stays. I believe their social behavior changes drastically in the role of all inclusive guest. Almost daily 30-50 of these short stay;3
We have been to Cuba a few times and wanted to explore a different area so we chose this one and can not say enough good things about the staff.  The resort was hit by hurricane Sandy and with supplies being hard to get is may not be up to some peoples standards but the people we met there including staff made this the most relaxing time we have ever had.  The housekeepers were wonderful as were the dining staff and the staff at the coffee bar.  Next year we will be staying here again only longer!  The show that they put on twice a week will make you laugh so hard your sides hurt.  This is 2 resorts together so you can always find something to eat and do.  The snorkeling was wonderful and the ocean was so nice and warm can't say enough good things about it.;4
WHO WE ARE. Older couple, mid-late 70s, very frequent travelers to Cuba since 1991. Hotel preference 3-3½ star hotels lower end of the budget. We like courteous friendly service, all with a smile. We like lots of safe walking in the hotel area at any time and hot and sunny February weather. We are repeat guests at this hotel.  HOLIDAY SUMMARY. OUR SUNWING FLIGHT from YYZ to Santiago de Cuba landed on time. Good smooth flight with a freebie glass of white sparkling wine thrown in, nice touch Sunwing. The 60 minute scenic transfer by bus to Corales was smooth and easy. We had an assisted quick check-in as the room was available on arrival, then before we knew it, the bellhop had our luggage in our room . It was just amazing to be cleaning heavy frost off the window of the car in;4
First time my kids (13,14) have ever been on a trip and what a great experience for them and us! The people were great! Food was good too although we did not do any off resort trips we just had a great time at the pool bar and the beach. Met some great new friends! What a great time. Highly recommend for a warm and pleasant vacation!;4
Just returned from another wonderful trip to Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales.  This time, my friend and I came down the first week - and 5 more friends/family members joined us the second week.  The first 2 days were quite cloudy - the other 12 were hot, sunny and amazing. Even saw the most beautiful rainbow ever, over the mountains.  I have been to this resort many, many times over the last 14 or 15 years.  I return to this hotel because of the people, the sun and the fun.  Over the years, we have made many friends at the hotel and it is always great to see them.  I have travelled to many all-inclusive resorts in a few countries, but I have to say that I have never met staff like the wonderful people working at this resort.  After 16 hour days, they still greet you with a smile;5
Returned from this resort last night. It is beautiful. Three of us stayed in room 518 facing the pool with 3 large beds. I read reviews about the noise. We range in age from 58-66 and had no complaints about the noise. Yes! the entertainment goes from 915-1100 pm. We watched it from our balcony. If we didn't we were in the room and didn't find it noisy.  Yes there are Cuban guests...so what they paid to be there the same as we did and no they were not served ahead of us. In fact while at the bar a Cuban guest was told to wait I was there first. This was by a bartender. Yes there are animals...you are in the country side! Yes dogs were at tables during meals where guests were feeding them so what do you expect???? Yes the power glitched a few times. ...no big deal.  Sometimes not;5
I have travelled to Los Corales and Carisol about 20 times over the last 30 years.  And the property is not what she once was.  The hotel is not being kept up.  lots of small things, painting, doors need repair and they don't shut properly.  Tiles missing in rooms.  I have to say that the staff as usual were wonderful for the most part, especially Francisco at the pool bar.  He would do anything he could to make your vacation good.  We arrived on the 2nd of January.  The first day was nice but then the rest of the first week was not great torrential rain.  Did not get much time on the beach the first week.;3
The Cuban people have made tourism a primary industry and are good at making visitors feel welcome and safe. You won't have any problems with the government in Cuba if you take it seriously and are honest and up-front about what you are in Cuba to do. In my case, I wanted to tour the legendary revolutionary Sierra Maestra mountains as well as determine if Cuba could be a good place to do business in the future.    The Cuban people who staff Club Amigo resort really do care. From the second my friends and I arrived we were greeted with smiles and respect. The concierge staff, bartenders, tourguides, entertainers, wait staff and maintenance workers are all very nice people that take a genuine interest in your vacation being successful.  Canadians complain about stuff sometimes.;5
Our 13th trip to Cuba in 9 years and 2nd to the Carisol Los Corales since November, 2010 commenced in Toronto on January 4, 2018 by Air Cubana. We immediately recognized the 23 year old, all-black livery Airbus A320, as we had flown it to Cienfuegos in January, 2016. After a 3.5 hour flight we landed in Santiago de Cuba just before 6:00 pm. The bus ride to the hotel took over one hour and we still managed to have dinner.  Two weeks before the departure, we had sent an email to the hotel, asking to either upgrade us to a bungalow at additional cost (bungalows were not offered by Hola Sun) or give us a quiet room, far from the pool and the entertainment area. Unfortunately, we got a room in Los Corales in the 500 section, which almost exactly met the conditions that we had NOT;3
We stayed in a room on the Los Corales side for 1 week in November 2015. We've just returned from a 2 week stay in an oceanview bungalow on the Carisol side. We'd certainly return and it wouldn't matter what side we ended up on. The Carisol side is quieter than the Los Corales side. As expected, the bungalows are more spacious. We accepted the 3rd bungalow offered to us. J4 had a leak in its bathroom ceiling and a pool of water on the floor. F3 lacked balcony chairs, furniture, a TV, toilet paper ... Martha, our wonderful chambermaid, put us in G3. We'd sometimes have no water but only went without showers a couple of days over our 2 week stay. Martha took great care of our bungalow.  Reservations for the 3 a la carte restaurants are booked daily between 10 am and 11 am near the;4
Reviews come from different people with different points of view. Therefore - disclamer: We are a family that loves camping, so we are used to very little comfort and we go to Cuba for sea, sun and unattended activities. And in Club Amigo Carisol we've got all we came for.  Now details. Flight was not very pleasant. Mainly because of landing in Camaguey. You see, it's four hours to Camaguey, then about 40 minutes waiting and another 40 minutes to Santiago. We took off at noon and we checked in quarter before nine. There was an hour and a half bus ride too. That's with Cubana Air.  The place is actually two hotels - Club Amigo Los Corales and Club Amigo Carisol. They share beach and... everything. I don't know why would they even have this division. With your Carisol braselet you;3
The check in was terrible!!!!!    I a Canadian citizen travelled there with my Cuban family.  I never experienced such discrimination. Our check in was supposed to be at 4pm we got a room at 9:30 pm.  We sat in the lobby until 8pm when finally the manager asked us all to come and eat. They never offered an explanation or offered any compensation in return. It was not only us but many other Cuban family’s staying at the hotel which had to also deal with this discrimination  A bus full of Canadian tourists arrived around 4:30 pm and they were given prompt service as soon as the arrived I spoke to the director a few days later but she also did nothing about the situation we experienced. Said she would but of course she didn’t. I was later told I should have requested an interview;3
Ok so the bar tenders at the pool bar where fantastic!. Our room attendant yoania was fantastic! And the woman doing the morning stretching was fantastic!. The rest of them , not so much  for example, face timing with their kids while people are waiting for drinks or squabbling with their coworkers .   We walked to the lagoon and looked at some crocs  and the next day we walked to the aquarium to swim with dolphins. (Don't pay for these excursion)  Very! Limited buffet with alot of cabbage! I've been to 11 resorts in cuba and I rank the food here at the bottom. Resort was clean with nice gardens . Good beach. Would I go back? Highly unlikely.;2
On Nov.12-23 my wife and I came to this resort for our vacation. We have visited this resort more than once and are extremely satisfied with the services provided. We would like to give a huge Thank You to the staff: Juan Torres, Reynaldo and Alejandro Sarmiento, Yohanne Leal and Marianela for all of your hard work and dedication! This is a wonderful resort to come and relax at, and staff are polite and professional. Thank you again for am amazing experience!  Igor and Uliana Sagalov.;4
We spent New Years at Los Corales.  The dinner & live music was outstanding.  We treasure the apple that we got.  C4 bungalow was the best.  Had a great time on the bicycles provided.  Excellent staff at Los Corales. Horseback riding in the mountains where the cacti are blooming was outstanding.   The Case de la Trova in Santiago is super cool.;3
This was our 3rd visit to Los Corales and it will be our last visit. We were a minority in the hotel compared to locals, which have no manners and were rude and very aggressive at the buffet table got hit by a plate still have the bruise  ,they were stealing food constantly, we had to start leaving our bags at the restaurant doors, and were greeted by security guards. I never saw this type of behavior in the previous visit, this is really not acceptable. Again, we won't be going there again for sure, very disappointed as we had to go off resort several times to be comfortable which added additional cost to our trip.  Christmas dinner, which a main event when traveling during Christmas, was a disaster, so many people, so much wait time, line up at the door to get in etc, i could;1
What Los Corales offers is a bit of Paradise, and a big bang for the buck.  It is nestled between Sierra Maestra hills and the Caribbean Sea, a lush oasis in the warmest, driest, most tropical part of Cuba.  The hotel is set amid coco palms, pines, and caleta trees.  It has the only blonde-sand beach in Santiago, and the biggest pool perfect for swimming or just frolicking by the bar.  There is plenty of quiet to lounge and read and sip cocktails in the shade, or one can just lie in the sun and bag the rays. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious and bright, beds comfy, balconies with a view. Food: great ingredients, a variety of protein- chicken, pork, beef, fish, etc., and of veggies, salads, fruits, carbs, sweets, etc.  Preparation, however, is uneven, yet one always finds a good;4
Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales, is a very noisy place Noisy music from 9 am to 11 everywhere by the pool on the beach in your room There is no  quite  place in the resort  You can hear the noisy music in your room all the time. Kids can not sleep because they play the music loud even after the evening show Music level during evening show is so big that people are using ears plugs  Only a few people are playing bingo and they announcements you can hear one kilometer away We complained and we were ignored  Avoid;1
My girlfriend and I visited this resort in late 2014. Lots of changes since then.   This time, I was in town to marry my lovely bride in Santiago, and we decided to have a family gathering at the hotel vs a party in her hometown in the province.   We brought in the closest relatives for a one-night stay (the wedding day) and we held the reception dinner in the a-la-carte restaurant, which the hotel management was kind enough to reserve for our exclusive use that night.   The decoration, service and food were EXCEPTIONAL. Including an wonderful cake that was prepared just for us.   The level of care, attention and friendship we received was way beyond anyone’s expectations.   This hotel has a very loyal group of (mostly Canadian) tourists that are repeat visitors and stay 1-3;5
Flew tour operator HolaSun Cubana with excellent care. Booked disability due to health recovery. Helped with luggage and through special services by Sr. Trevor, the Cubana Hola Pearson air port rep. Whisked through customs and taken to boarding where flight attendants came looking for me to help with carry on. Lovely snack pac of croissant , cold meat, cheese , lettuce, brownie and desert.  Quiet trip landing in Santiago and then bused off to  Los Corales. Good room in the 300 block. Sandwiches at reception for late arrival and Ranchon is now open 24 hrs. a day with food, drinks and wine.     Off to the buffet where improvements by chef Gilberto have the hot and cold tables functioning and the food warm. Lots of salads and desserts. We had turkey, roast chicken, various cuts of;4
"Room was nice, 2nd story with high vaulted ceilings. Even though I got there late, the 24 hr bar was open and was able to get a beer and hotdog. Now this isn't your GRAND 5 STAR place, so don't book it expecting that. The rooms were generally clean and well laid out. BUT this is Cuba and things happen from time to time. I didn't have hot water for a day, but so what. Food was good. Selections were limited for my ""meat and potatoes"" type of style, but there was enough and I didn't go hungry.  It is an old resort. They were fixing things and at this time, only one side was open.";4
I was with my family twice, and each time I loved it more. It has a pool with bar and it is an all-inclusive hotel! The food is varied and delicious, the rooms are comfortable and have nice spaces, a pool table, etc.;5
I just come back from a week at this resort. For a 3 Star resort it is very nice, freshly upgraded, very clean, nice sandy beach with both trees and shelters,  Above ALL the staff, from the top management to all the workers are super nice. It's only 3 star and do not expect 4 and 5 star amenities and food.;4
My hubby,a co-worker,and myself visited CACC March 23~30 flew from Toronto with Cubana no problems there.Someone told me they fly their planes like they stole them and they do! We were in 400 block on Corales side. Great location room 401 bottom floor corner right across from the pool bar ! Room was ok until bathroom upstairs started to leak and flooded us out of our room.We were moved right away down the hall. There was a bad sewer odor all week aswell .The food wasn't the best but we always found something to eat. My friend and I did a tour took us allover on a train it was 40cuc pp.I would never do it again.Long day and way to hot !! Our lastnight there we went across the road to a restaurant (far right with Canadian Flag) best Lobster dinner I have ever had !!! Would we;4
Club Amigo Los Corales, I was there after the March break, I was not sure about the destination but I had a fantastic holiday there and I loved the Cuban staff, very kind, down to earth people, who were always ready to help. I took some of the tours and they were excellent, I liked the fortress the best. I do not usually eat lunch but as I spent several hours every day at the beach, I tried the food at the Beach Restaurant, which turned out to be very tasty. I would like to come back with my wife and son and rent one of the bungalows on the far side, they look very cool and quiet.;5
This was our first vacation to Cuba. We were there in 2008, but there is no option to show that, so I am showing March 2017 instead. It was a good introduction to Cuba for our family. We did not expect a lot of our room, but were pleased with the pleasant maid and upkeep of our room. It was basic and comfortable. The food was bland, but we knew it would be. The pools were nice and the beach was a bit rocky for our tastes. The nightly entertainment on the property was great and appropriate for families.;4
My friend and I on a recommendation from a friend booked a week for our first Cuban experience - food and drinks food, rooms clean, safe resort.  Snorkelled 6 out of the 7 days beautiful sunsets .  Resort activities every day I thought the food exceeded my expectation;4
Flew Cubana air. Fight was fine airport was a nightmare. I booked handicapped as I had knee surgery a month prior. Wheel chair was at the plane but once inside the building, he told me to get out of the chair and left me there. I at least had a cane with me. They saw me struggling so got thru customs quickly but didn't let my husband. Waited almost 20 minutes for him to get thru. My walker was the last thing off the plane. Ride to resort was fine, check in was quick as we got a van because we were the last out of the airport. Room was where we requested. It nightime by then. This is not a disabled friendly resort. Buffet inside is 3 steps up to tables so you can only eat outside. Breakfast was very good if you got an omlette otherwise very little choices. Best lunch was the;2
This was our 2nd trip to this hotel and we were are not returning back.   The food is repetitive to the ridicule. As if chief does not know any recipes.  From the same products you can cook so many different dishes,  but it was the same menu every day.   There is a night disco somewhere in neighborhood every Friday and Saturday that lasts until 4 or 5 am. You will not be able to sleep and hotel does not care to control the impact of it to the only hotel in the area.  The coral reef is almost dead and the lagoon is almost all covered with sea weed with tons of urchins - impossible to swim in the ocean.   Staff is cery friendly but there is that much they can do.   The doctors are on board 24 hours but in emergency situations expect to wait for the ambulance for minimum of 2;2
Stayed here  with my 2 teenaged daughters during march break. Upon arrival I was a little worried as the hotel looked run down from the front lobby.  Food was not that good, selection was very poor and nothing really changed at all from day to night. For lunch we usually ate pizza/pasta which was located beside the main restaurant,  as it was the most edible, but unfortunately took the longest to get. We did eat at the Cuban restaurant which you had to make reservations for the same day as you wanted to eat. Waiting time for reservations was long, as you had to order your main course right then but only has one menu to look at. The pool was clean and Pool bar bartenders were great, Always happy and ready to serve:) The beach area was clean but small and the water only had a few;3
We have been in February. I agree that some things may change since, but some simply can't change. I have been to 3 stars before in Cuba, but this one set new low standards. The combination of 3 stars, Cuban own hotel, and extra season, produced the worst I have ever seen. I am usually choosing a hotel based on the beach and water, as better food and drinks can be found in Canada at any time. I am not picky: all I want is a clean & quiet room, and something to eat. Let's describe them, one by one. The room was probably the was the only thing helping with the 2/5 stars rating, otherwise it would have been lower. We had an ocean view bungalow. I have to mention that we were initially given a parking view room, although the ticket clearly stated ocean view. It was promptly changed;2
Hello everybody,  I had an amazing time at this resort.  The facilities were clean, the food was super, and there was no maintenance problems.  The management went above and beyond to ensure all the guests had a terrific stay.  This was my 18th time in Cuba and I  have never seen such involved and active management at a resort.  The activities and entertainment were phenomenal and provided as though we were in a 5+ star hotel.  I will be back for soon for sure, and I will bring many friends!  -Marta P;5
My friend and are regular 3 star Cuba travelers and we enjoyed this resort.  Resort: Two sides Corales and Carisole - Corales was open during this low time season, my opinion nicer of the two sides. Buffet is small inside but room to eat outside much better.  Food was decent but not much variety but it is low season and we were only 80 guests.  Ate off resort 2x for lobster and they great  ($10-$15cuc)  Rooms: Stayed in block 200 - had Beatriz as maid for the week and she was great !  Room clean, beds, firm, small pillow one per bed bring an extra one if you can (bought $1.99ea pillow from Ikea and left it )  A/C worked well and hot water and pressure good.  No bugs either!  Beach: It is not a manicured beach, and when I read bring water shoes I thought it would be like Holguin;4
It is a spectacular place, a lovely natural environment, with a very good attention for the guests, excellent food, a clean and organized place. It is an excellent place to rest, although they also have recreational activities, in my opinion is the best;5
Very good hotel. The staff is very very kind. I love this hotel...... I'll be there next year!!!!! The beach is wonderful and the sun is amazing!!!!  The restaurants are good, the music and drinks are perfect!!!! I loved it!!!!!;5
The hotel is ok, has a nice pool and several bars, but the staff are generally inattentive, if not rude, with some exceptions.  You could sit and wait for ,your morning coffee and no one would come around to give you some, particularly the staff serving the outdoor dining room area.  It looked as if there was a change in management and a lot of mumbling and chatting while we guests waited.  The food was meh.. and I am easily pleased.  Cabbage a thousand ways, but that's Cuba.   If you are happy to have some grilled fish and salad, you should be ok. One of the bartenders made great piña coladas, so she should get some credit for that. Considering how close they are to Santiago, you would think they would organize daily trips, but no...so funny.   Not worth returning, in my view;3
Came here as a group of six with 2 eleven year old girls and had a good vacation.Weather was warm and mostly dry.We are all well traveled and fairly easy going.This is about the cheapest all inclusive available anywhere so be prepared to compromise.If you are high maintenance and want a luxury vacation suck it up and pay for a 5 star.Don't come here and whine.  Food was OK not a huge selection and none of us got sick.Yes occasionally they run out of plates for a few minutes and staffing at the buffet is a bit of an issue but was overall satisfactory.  Grill on the beach serves a tasty lunch and you can get good burgers and hotdogs until 2 am. There is a pizza/pasta place right next to the buffet that serves excellent pizza but is very chaotic ,don't go there if in a rush. Pool;3
We stayed there in March. We had a very, very good time overall, although the first impression was not that good (birds jumping on dining tables during lunch, very noisy air conditioner in the room, chronic shortage of of plates at the buffet area at times, etc. All those flaws were quickly forgotten mostly because of authentic, nice and helpful people like Armando (yes, sign up for those Salsa Dance lessons - it's fun), Francisco at the Pool Bar, etc  Good, white sand beach with free paddle boat, kayak rides etc. Snorkeling is ok too, not great just ok. Too bad people are actually walking on the coral-rock that is closest to the shore instead of just letting it be so it can renew itself/regrow but perhaps Hotel must put up a sign informing poeple not to do it. Hotel could use;3
I have been to Cuba many times. This was my first trip to Santiago de Cuba. It is very mountainous here. It is VERY hot and dry. Don't underestimate the power of the sun here. Wear your sunscreen and a hat. We took a day trip into Santiago de Cuba, which is 50 minutes away by bus. The city is very crowded with people. Drivers are crazy on the roads.   Here are some items worth noting about this resort and the area:  1. Very Hot, sunny weather every day. We experienced temperatures mid-day between 33 and 43 degrees Celsius every day.   2. Nice big pool  3. Gardeners are lovely, friendly people  4. Dogs, puppies, cats and kittens were everywhere. Turn on your A/C before you go to sleep to drown out barking dogs  5. Bed covers and blankets are not washed. They are reused after each;3
This resort had the best staff ever, very laid back vacation. Felt like longer then 1 week. relaxing and caring folks all around, the rooms wasn't the best but we only sleep on there. Sun-wing also offered a deal on the trip into the City.;4
There are lots of flaws and things that need to be upgraded but overall we had a great trip. Yes the beach has lots of seaweed and the sand is rocky but there were spots you could go in and get cooled off. If you like to snorkel there is great snorkeling right off the beach.  The food was typical for a 3 star Cuban resort. Nothing spectacular but we gained weight so there must have been lots to eat. Most of the staff were great. A cook at the pizza / pasta buffet Maria was spectacular. The omelette cooks were all good , plates and cutlery. Some staff were not as friendly and slow but they aren't paid very well and I think we were 1 of the few who tipped.  Room was well taken care of by Lydia .The rooms need some upgrades but overall clean and safe. Yes a stick to lock the patio;4
I really want to mention everyone in the hotel that made my travel time one of the best ever !  Lets start with Dalia she kept my room implacable  clean, the staff at the beach always willing to make you comfortable,  Lietys at the Restaurant very prompt and aware that you are having a good meal with respective drinks really she is the best one !  Santa at the bbq meals always welcoming you with a great smile, Mr. Baconao the Chef is the greatest he put so much into delight the paladar of everyone. Norberto at the night bar and when join the music entertaiment the best to trust as well as Raul Moro  that will take care of you.  Maryledis you were amazing thank you so much for taking care that enjoy every minute of my stay,  Norberto thank you for delivering my gratitude to all;5
We have traveled to many resorts in Cuba and understand that the food is poor and amenities lacking but that does not excuse this terrible hotel. Saying that, I must admit that the bungalow rooms are great and the maids keep them very clean. Also entertainment staff were great. We only experienced excellent service from the room maid, the pool bar staff and Vincent, one of the waters at the buffet. Every day we had to clear the dirty dishes from the tables, get all our own dishes cutlery and drinks. The food and soup were not labelled so you didn't know what you were eating also no heating trays so food was always cold.  You can only get hot drinks at the buffet at breakfast time, any other time you have to go to one of the bars. When we queried this we were told that it is;2
To start on a positive note....The Bungalows are lovely and the staff who maintain them did a wonderful job.  Nothing was to much trouble  pleasant, cheerful and kept the rooms immaculate.  Francisco at the Pool bar is great and so much fun, and the lady at Customer Relations was always pleasant and tried her best to be helpful, Vincent in the dining room did a great job.  The animation team were fun and very friendly making pool aerobics and dance lessons probably the highlight of our stay...... Having said that this is a very dirty resort, the public washroom near the dining room were disgusting and in our three week stay we never saw them cleaned once. Staff at the reception had a hard time looking away from the computer and I saw an elderly gentleman who was having some;1
I just returned yesterday from this resort.  I am a seasoned three star Cuba traveller, and having traveled to this lovely country 14, maybe 15 times.  This is the worst resort I have been to.  I'll start with the staff, I think they would rather be doing something else, I tried tipping, and not tipping, it did not change the service I received.  I can't count how many times I had to pour my own coffee at breakfast, get my own cutlery out of the drawer, or sit at a table that had dirty plates, or wait for clean plates to be brought out to the buffet.  The staff at the lobby bar were the rudest I have encountered ever.  I had so many eye rolls when I asked for simple items from water to cola to pina colada (which by the way was very watered down, it had no flavour). They actually;1
Upon arrival to our resort , it was very run down and not very appealing .. the room was below average and they do not provide clean drinking water .. the food typical of Cuba aside from the breads which were horrible tasted like a barn smells of that makes sense it was awful.. the swim up bar was great and great staff , the beach was far and not really a beach at all it was rocky and weedy and very few lounge chairs. Our sunwing rep was an absolute joke , if you go to this resort there is a bus that goes into Santiago de Cuba very cheap which he did not tell us about .. we did go into the city beautiful but be prepared for a whole lot of moochie moochie. Worse than I have ever encountered on vacation .. the shows every evening were alright but had to walk to the other resort;1
"Get the ""bad"" stuff out of the way-  food some days I found inedible ...but you don't go to cuba for the food. Room - wooden stick to lock the patio Door as the lock was broken, some sheets had stains, an outlet looked a bit scary...so we stayed away from it....Beach had lots of seaweed....but still swim-able.   Good stuff!!- EVEN WITHOUT GIFTS the staff was super friendly and did whatever they could to ensure we enjoyed our stay. From hanging out with us to catering to our needs. I've been to 5 star hotels and 4 star hotels in Jamaica , Panama,  Barbados,  etc.....but the staff at Club amigo treated their clients with more care and genuinity than any resort I've been to before. I saw the staff go beyond their duty to ensure adults and children were safe and happy. (We didn't";4
We have been to Cuba many times and have stayed at everything from 3 star to 5 star resorts.  We know what to expect and always come with an open mind.   At the end of the day we know that no matter what we will have a good time.  Having said that, we noticed some deficiencies in Amigo Carisol Los Coralas that need to be rectified. When there are not enough utensils or plates to serve your guests thats a problem.  When you do not have enough staff to assist guests in the dining room and we are left searching for cutlery, glasses, or to find a table that can we have to clean off ourselves just to be able to sit and eat, thats a problem.  The food was lacking in variety and compared to other 3 stars didnt offer much.  Yes, we always managed to find something to eat but one can;2
This was our 1st trip to this resort.  We were a grouping four on this trip. We will definitely be going back. The resort was kept clean people were awesome. Room was lovely... Bungalow D-1. Thank you Dalia for great service. The lobby bar where  the best capachino was made by the beautiful and friendly Yollanis works and Then there is the pool bar Coo Coo Francisco is fantastic... Miss him already. Beach is a little rocky but view was awesome. Food was good for Country resort never went Hungary. The people that work at this resort are amazing including David and the staff at the daiquiri bar. The entertainment was excellent. Weather was fantastic. Thank you all for a great week.;5
Alright, so this resort had a few problems, but they were in the process of fixing them. No unusual problems, this is Cuba. This was the most fun we have had on a trip to Cuba yet. You are out in the mountains. The snorkeling was fantastic(best ever). Not a sandy bottom, all  rocks and weeds, but if you love to snorkel, this is the place for you. The food was pretty good for a 3 star. Not a lot of variety, but what was there was good. Can go to buffet in one area, and buffet in another area as well. The staff were awesome, and made the trip even better. I would definitely go to this resort again. Were with a wonderful group of friends, which of course, makes the trip even better. Goats and horses and donkeys walking thru the resort. Big lizards. Very different from other parts;4
Carisol-Los Corales Rocks!  We just came back from a great week at Carisol Los Corales in the south east of Cuba. The weather was amazing! The place stands between the mountains and sea, there is lots of wildlife around! Awesome birds, beautiful butterflies, lovely fish and sea creatures. The hotel is clean, the staff is excellent and all the food is organic! Most of what they serve is grown in the country, using traditional methods. The price was very reasonable for a family of four!  I certainly recommend this resort!;5
Stayed at Club Amigo Carisol los Corales. (Residing at the Corales Side.)  February 26th to March 1, 2017.  WHO WE ARE. Older couple, mid-70s, seasoned and frequent travelers to Cuba since 1991, preferences are 2-3½ star Cuban hotels on the lower end of the budget. This would be our 5th time to this particular hotel complex. As always, there was some minor annoyances, but on the overall, we had a very pleasant time. It definitely will not be our last time as we had for ourselves a very nice holiday and got what we came for — i.e., friendly locals, friendly staff, reasonably good service, lots of safe walking any time, hot and sunny February weather.   HOLIDAY SUMMARY.  OUR SUNWING FLIGHT to Santiago de Cuba was smooth and on time. On the flight, we enjoyed a freebie glass of;3
this place has been change a lot  it was fare one time now is totally different,in dec 2016 I didn't no much, the workers are not as frientlly like many years ago this time I found same old food every day no phone in the room if you want communicate outside the country they don't sale the phone cards, need to go to the desk and use theirs phone and charge lots money if some one call you rare if you get message from them. then when a person goes to the bar and don't give a tips forget you not going get cervid, they serve same old people all time I had en argument with them its all about money, lots tourist they said ho they are frientlly people there is reason why they want tips, outside of the hotel no one will look at you,it happened to me many of times, now I have been 2 weeks;2
Got there on the 15th and was greeted with a cup of sugar water with a little coloring..the worst taste.  The room was pretty good, it was an a joined suite as we were 5 with 3 kids including a baby.  No water in the room.  Went to dinner and wanted to cry when I saw what was offered.  The worst food ever..my granddaughter ate plain rice most nights as the chicken was mostly raw (blood showing).  The staff was very unhelpful unless you tipped them.  The beach was the worst I have ever seen.  There were no activities for the kids had to play in the pool all day.  The Kids got sick and the baby was very sick since we are back in TO.  Practically had to walk to the front bar to get hot water for the baby.  Very poor lighting in the walkways and ants in the room.  Nothing to eat in;1
"This is our 4th trip to this resort since 2013.Once again we were not disappointed; actually the food was better this time around. Again weather; guaranteed sunshine day in day out and this is what we got.  The Scuba Dive team is amazing and so is the entertainment team.  Yes the beach is not the best but the water temperature at 82F was amazing Yes once again they did run out of stock (Vodka, Soda water, etc) but that did not stop us from having a great time.  Stay was February 15 to 22 from Montreal";4
As a first time traveler to Cuba and using Sunwing.... I would be hard pressed to ever do it again. Upon arrival at the airport it was very confusing on which bus to take to the resort.  As I was traveling with my 85 year old mother  it was a challenge. Check in took well over an hour and half...  one desk clerk! The room itself was clean.   I will give it that much! Dated for sure.  Bed was more like sheet of plywood, one pillow.  And NO WATER.... NO WATER FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN THE SHOWER!  Everyday for three days I asked.. and then asked again for this to be addressed.  Was told on several occasions it was being looked after and I would have water by the afternoon.... by the evening.. and never happened.  I reached the end of my rope when in the middle of the third night.. there;2
"I have just returned from a 2 week stay on the Corales side of this resort. And I will note I have been 8 times to Cuba, mainly on the Caribbean side.  I will start with the ""good"" stuff... The location..amazing scenery We were upgraded to a Bungalow at no charge  (D1) The housekeeping staff....wonderful lady, did an amazing job! Water-hot water everyday, no issues. Morag--who does the Laguna excursions for Hola Sun. A wonderful kind man who ensured our  vacation was amazing.  Now unfortunately the cons of this resort. There were many. Staff unfriendly, not approachable The large group of selfish pushy tourists who reserved the very few beach chairs everyday. One of my biggest pet peeves and it was rampant at this resort. Out of 14  days we spent 12 sitting on the sand or the";3
My wife and I very much enjoyed our 2 week stay. Ted an Laura were great friends and brought us to see the real people and the real Cuba. We were invited into peoples homes and enjoyed wonderful coffee and huge lobster suppers. Horse and buggy travel was a real treat. Our room attendant,Dagna, deserves special praise for her great personality and keeping our room clean. Our room was facing the pool and close to restaurants. The food was plentiful and included hot pork roast, chicken,fish and beef and a wide variety of other choices.The pool was always clean and the bar staffs were great. The only negative is that the food at the buffet was left on the counters and/or not refrigerated or covered over between meals. Would highly recommend this change.;4
Review from Olga and Svetlana  Is there a lot of places in this world where you can fulfill yourself with health and joy? And would like to add, for a very affordable price. Its like you find yourself in another dimension! Where there's no everyday stress, where you actually hear how the birds sing, smile doesn't go away from your face, where your body - every single cell of it - gets filled with health and all the team of the resort help you with joy to experience it  We are so thankful to Alechandro and Marleidis for their thoughtful care. And especially we are grateful to Lissette Bell Masso for her kind heart, friendly attitude and extraordinary teamwork skills.  We definitely recommend this place to everyone who wants to rejuvenate, restore their health and gain joy.  We;4
"No water in our room for first 5 days. Wouldn't move us to another room. Locals were being sneaked in for free with no wrist bands, and totally eating everthing they could before the paying guests could get to the food. We didn't eat anyhow because without toilets....you can't ! Staff was very lackadaisical...we were told that we should ""bear with them"" while they work through their water problem. Fact is....there was NO WATER to be pumped. I wonder how the kitchen staff dealt with that. DO NOT GO to the Carisol side....and if you wander over to the Corales side. good luck in the food line ups.";1
My wife and I have been back here for the last 8-10 years and one of the reason we come back here is the weather is always in the 80s also its safe, For where else can you take a walk at 6 am in the morning just before the sun comes up without being accosted? The public relation lady Marleidis is exceptional for we have noticed that she goes beyond her duty , On this trip there was a man who had to have a pacemaker put in and because of his frail condition he had to have it done at Santiago. Well wouldnt you know it she went to see him on her day off plus she kept many of us who new the man informed of his status . I was sick for few days from a cold I caught in Toronto and was laid up, Everytime she saw my wife she asked how I was she is a real asset to Corales. at the outside;3
This is the third time I've visited this resort. The last time I was here was in April, 2015. I do like coming back to this place because of the location and the staff. With the Sierra Maestra mountains in the background and the Caribbean on the other side it makes a perfect location. There were some changes at the resort since last time I was there. They have added an additional a la carte restaurant which was quite nice. This was the first time that our room was located in one of the  bungalows. It was quite nice. There was plenty of hot water, and the toilet was very modern. As regards the food - I found it to be plentiful and a good variety. If you are looking for very spicy food, bring your own spices and hot sauces from home. They are not easily available here. I would;3
We stayed in Los Corales for two weeks, we had a great time! Out of all the places I have visited in Cuba, Santiago is the best place in terms of weather. It only rained for one hour during our whole entire trip. It was my third time in Santiago and the weather has always been this amazing. We stayed in the bungalow. Our maid Judy did an amazing job keeping our rooms clean. A special thanks to Marleidis for all her help, professionalism and amazing service. The food was good. There was also great live entertainment and shows every night. I would definitely go back again! Recommended.;5
The front desk was helpful to get us our room. Our room was nice and clean (washroom, bedsheets and towels) thanks to our housekeeper lady. The restaurant was different than last year, it was closed in with windows, doors and airconditions and lot of  variety of foods and desserts and we enjoyed unlimited visit to the three alacart restaurant, the meal and service was excellent. there are 5 bars at the hotels, the bar tenders are all friendly and fast service with a smile. We spend 15 days in a hot sunny weather. We wants to thanks all the Coralos team especially the director and the commercial managers and the public relations and front desk staff. WE are looking forward to go back next year to our second home  and spend more time.  We have been in this hotels more than 20;4
January 2017 visit to Carisol and Los Corales  Overall, the stay was wonderful. Great weather, clean place, cosy beach. A bit windy at times. The staff was helpful, went well beyond their duties to accomodate the guests. The food was plenty and the bar was well stocked. We came on a family room. The place is safe for kids. A bit far away from the city, about 60 kms, we took a tour to the city and we enjoyed it, although the day was very hot. It is a great get away for the winter. I spoke to a retired lady, she has been there for months. She hope to keep doing it every year! And we hope to return, too!;4
Having stayed at a 3 star in Varadero a number of years ago, we had reasonable expectations for this one. We stayed on the Corales side in a standard room on the main level. Good things: Friendly staff, bread was delicious!, a la carte dining was good with unlimited reservations (have to reserve daily in the lobby at 10:00), snorkeling was pretty good off the beach, pool was fun, bikes are available at no charge, but can be hard to get, hammocks on the beach were great, weather was perfect! The bath towels and beach towels were nice and big. Internet is available on two computers in the lobby for 1 CUC per 30 minutes.  Other notes: mattresses are very hard, pillows (one per bed) are not very good either, sheets are very worn, buffet is a little sketchy - hot food is not kept;3
Trying to reach a relative to notify them of an emergency family situation at this hotel. No one answers the phone. When they do they can't speak any English not even enough to understand that we NEED English. Had to get someone from our work who knows locals near that beach and have them out out some kind of all call through the community looking for her!!!  What the hell is that all about!? First off : ANSWER THE PHONE!  Second off: Don't hang up when someone says English please in Spanish and says Urgencia!!  Try to help people better than that!! One of your guests lost a loved one and it shouldn't be so difficult to contact someone paying to stay here!;1
My 4th trip to Corales since 2007 and innumerable trips to Cuba since 1988 became a 2 trip centre. I spent the 1st week at Corales and the 2nd at Carisol. I really enjoyed both sides of this resort but Carisol has become my favourite. The snorkeling was great and the beach easily accessible from both resorts. The weather superb! And this really a 3 * double resort open to all.     Corales is for people who want entertainment, exercise at the pool, dance classes, yoga , music and a more structured environment.      Carisol is for those of us who like peace and quiet!!! Far more tranquil and not so many tourists!     New improvements to the dining area on both sides are interesting. Closing in the dining areas is a plus but no one mans the doors and is self defeating as they have;3
We're still coming back to this resort annually and being rewarded for our faith in the people here and the weather is unbeatable in Jan. / Feb. Since last year the following updates were evident: -New windows and doors in dining areas in both compounds -New air conditioning units in all the bungalows -Newly painted walls and fixtures in Carisol entrance and bar. -New furniture covers on furniture in both lounges. -Fence along the beach to keep unwanted animals (and people) out. To those who complain about dogs and or cats on the property - remember this is a country setting. You can have none of the above but who's going to control mice and other small pests. The guests who constantly feed the dogs / cats in or just outside the dining areas are the real problem here. -New;4
Diseased and flea ridden feral dogs run loose even into the open air dining areas. We paid extra to upgrade to a bungalow. BIG MISTAKE. We had a dog with four pups living under our bungalow, barking through the night resulting in very little sleep. I complained about this to the manager on a daily basis and despite assurances the problem would be corrected very little was done.  The food was terrible, even by Cuban standards. Food hygene was non existent. food normally served hot was cold and cold cuts, cheese etc. was not chilled. The only saving grace for this resort is the staff who were great doing their best to meet ones needs. We will not return to this resort and certainly cannot recommend it. Not worth the money.;1
"This is my first visit to Cuba and stayed at this resort for a week. I shall say most staff there are nice and try very hard to make guests comfortable, but some male staff can be rude when things do not go the way they wanted. Will not get into too many details, but just say they may take advantage of you do not understand Spanish.   One of my concerns of this resort is building safety. In the room we stayed in, there were two wires sticking out of a power outlet (see the picture attached), which have electricity going through. When my boyfriend tried to plug a camera charger in to the wall, he accidentally touched them and got a shot. Luckily it was not serious. If you are going as a family with young children, be careful! May be this is just me being crazy; I like to check";2
We had amazing time. I loved the food however my husband was not a big fan but he likes his pepper and the resort does not have any. The snorkeling off the beach is amazing just make sure you bring water shoes. We did 2 excursion the full day trip to santiago and the snorkeling they are both worth the money and I would recommend them both.  The bar staff and housekeeping were amazing!  The cons the resort kept running out of water the last day. Carisol was put of water for 3 days. Los Corales buffet outside all you can smell is sewage. We stayed in building 1 and all we could smell was sewage.  Overall because of the water issues and I got sick due to uncooked fish and cross contamination chicken we would not return.;3
"We were shipped to this resort as our hotel reservation in Santiago was cancelled due to Fidel Castros burial on the next day.  The staff at reception was overrun by busloads of tourists so it was very slow (over two hours before check in) Our room was basic but we had everything we needed. The cleaning could have been done more thoroughly. The kitchen staff did not really manage to serve fast enough for that many ""unexpected"" guests.  Overall this is a good resort and I would give it 3 1/2 stars";3
"We were at Los Corales Dec 7 - 14, just after the 9 day period of mourning for Castro had passed.  This was our 4th trip to Cuba, although the first to the Santiago area.  We got a very good price on this resort, so decided to chance it for a quick break before Christmas.  I'll break down the review into segments:  RESORT - On the small side and quiet.  Things are well-cared for here, but not fancy.  The pool is beautiful and well-maintained; enough lounge chairs to go around and all  of them look new.  The grounds are a bit tired-looking, but this is very arid countryside.  We got an oceanview bungalow which I would recommend although I didn't see the layout of the basic rooms.  The bungalow room is spacious with a balcony.  Again, utilitarian, but we were comfortable.  Any";3
"Sorry this will be a long review but when I searched for details there were not many in the reviews. I will try to highlight a few very important points in capital letters so if you are skimming you will find them. We were a group of 4 in our 60's. Got exactly what we expected to get. Research, research, research and there will be no surprises!  OVERVIEW: basic price = basic resort. This is why it got only 3 stars; the 3 does not reflect satisfaction.  Our trip was Dec.7-14. The property is a quiet, well laid out Cuban run resort, isolated from a lot of activity as it is in Baconao Nature Park surrounded by the Sierra Maestre Mountains. If you are young and want to party this resort is not for you. If you want deluxe 5 star, this is not for you. If you want to feel Cuba and you";3
Went to this resort many times.Every time i go back i notes improvement.I was there in February 2016 for a month,November 2016 two weeks. Visit it many other places Barbados,Europe,Panama,Dominican republic,Hawaii,Mexico,and many more so i have something to compere.Reason i keep going back to this resort it is a beautiful weather,nice and friendly staff,clean resort,food not bad,always something to eat,fresh juice and eggs in the morning,cheese,pancake,french toast,good coffee.For lunch next to everyday restaurant ,pasta and pizza restaurant is open,very friendly lady works there. you can tell that kitchen staff and chef trying hard to please people,but you are always going to find guest that like to complain.I specially like bread.Guest in this resort are from all ages.Some;4
The trip: After 2 years later, I travelled from Montreal to this place, the check in by Sunwing was excellent. Very quick, helpful, and efficient. The cabin crew was excellent too. This was 2 stops flight. There was a bit waiting to be checked by their security guys due to one machine working, but on the positive side, the check in bags were ready when all the checks were done. Getting into the bus was quick and efficient. They had envelopes ready with the keys to room, bracelet, and the registration card. The bus trip took 1 hrs. and it is great scenic route. The check in into hotel was quick as well.  Accommodation: I stayed in the cabana A3. Good A/C, good bathroom, and larger than regular room. The maid service was excellent. Good TV reception. In the cabanas the new A/C;4
Went two club amigo corales in April of this year was very skeptical about going reading all the bad reviews..my family and i had such a great time staff was very friendly and helpful especially fernando the bartender ..our maid was great room was always cleaned it was so good that were going back again in November 23 for the second time two enjoy the staff the people sun beach and food......;4
I have been to this resort before and they have made many improvements. The staff is always wonderful and make this resort worth the vacation. The food is still just ok, and you wont starve. Way to much prostitution at this place then I have seen here before, if they want to improve the overall hotel they need to get this problem fixed. We all know this goes on, But many other resorts do not allow it. Sorry but no one likes seeing young girls with old ( and I mean old) men.;3
I ended up at this resort, even tho I did not book it, nor would have.  Sunwing over booked my resort, and did not tell me, until after I was in Cuba.  They said I could get a refund, but would be responsible to find my own way home.  Real nice! They promised a few nice things, none ever materialized, despite several inquiries.  I was so upset, I would not post any review.  As I did like the hotel and staff. It's simply not the resort I booked.  I had hoped to snorkel everyday.  There is no snorkeling here, unless you go by boat. It is too far to walk in the lengthy shallow water to find any decent snorkeling area.  So, I decided to relax in my pod. There was no where to go, as it is far away from anywhere.  If one wants to relax, drink cervaza at the pool bar, and eat buffet;3
This was our second trip to this resort. We were there for two weeks in November and returned in April for another two weeks. The staff here is so amazing, they become part of your circle of friends and I believe that is why there are so many return clients. The rooms are just that rooms , clean and comfortable. The food is nothing spectacular but you certainly wont starve. The weather is fantastic, the water is warm and so much to see in the water. The rural setting of this place is not for everyone but it is great . There are excursions for those who want to sight see and if you want to go snorkelling just see William. We had a great time and made many friends If you are looking for five star this is not the place for you but if you are looking sun and fun look not further. I;4
adjoining rooms for our kids, amazing staff, great pool, lots of excursions to choose from.  fantastic weather and the water was warm and good snorkeling.  we did the catamaran day trip into Santiago and it was fabulous!!;5
My husband and I went there for a week we had such a great time the rooms are nice, spacious, comfortable, and really nice.  Lissette was a major support in our stay. The decoration is incredible and the room in general is very clean and organized. I cannot ask for a better stay in Santiago, the Beach, the pool and other ammenities are incredible.  My husband and I had the best time. The Beach is very nice. Great for couples and families!!!;5
My cousin and I stayed here from march 24  for 1 week. met up with great people. lot s of fun. the new ranchon /disco was good for lunch and good times at night dancing!! our room very large with 2 dble beds. ocean view .. second floor at end # 213. bathroom newly renovated with hair dryer that worked!! the staff would go out of their way to please you.. I will be going back when they reopen in Nov...;4
We returned from Carisol Los Corales April 1. The temperature was in the high 30s every day and the Ocean was almost as hot! The Carisol side was closed so we were at Corales. We stayed in a suite close to the beach and had no problems with our room or the service by our maid Yurina. The buffet food was ok and the Rancho food and pizza was better. If you are a pool bar person you will have a great time but if you prefer the Ocean for swimming then not so much. There is only a small area for swimming the rest is rock and coral. The beach is ok but not great for walking...maybe 30minute walk from cliffs to mountains so not a lot to cover. There is a store at the resort but often ran out of things like juice and water. Frank at the Coco bar (by the beach) made the best Mojitos on;3
We have been in Carisol Los Corales 5 times. We are coming back for amazing weather and amazing people. We love it!!! Staff is wonderful, rooms are clean. Hotel is only 3 stars and I believe we received a bit more. Food is good. We can go to any of two buffets they have. Amazing bar tenders will try to make you happy... Entertainment team is great. Never forget... What is good for you...is good for me to... Barbara, Marleidis, Yulie, and all my great friends... Thank you for having us, and see you next time!!!;5
We enjoy a lot those days in Corales, my family felt just wonderful. The staff were more than exceptional. I want to thx Liseete and Marleidis for  the professionalism they all represent. One of the things i like the most were the smell of the rooms;5
Ok where to start we enjoy going to this resort been there 7/8 times now.  People there are amazing. Marleidis is a wonderful Public Relations person and now a great friend. Fransisco at the pool bar is also fantastic Boy I wish he was here working at our Legion he would be bringing the people in for sure. lol. Of course Ivan is right there to help him and look after the pool also. The games at the pool are always fun even if it is just to watch. and of course bingo  The newly finished beach restaurant/disco is great. We even had sweet potato fries the first time we went but didn't get them again the rest of the trip wish we had of they were good.  Buffets are just that buffets. We always found something to eat no problem and the pizza in Cuba are the best ever. Never went;5
It was our second visit to this hotel,My wife and I were there in Dec 2015 and again in March 2016.  It is good value for the money .Rooms were clean, Buffet food is average, but the a la carte was great, also the lunch at the beach restaurant was very good. the pizza is amazing.  Above all the staff was wonderful.  Gilbert and Lucy Ontario Canada;4
Club Carisol Los Corales located in the Santiago de Cuba area, happens to be blessed with Sun yesterday, sun today, tomorrow and sun next month, for Canadians like us, it is a rair commodity, This was our first visit, a long one (2 months, wow) and my wife and I enjoyed every minute, could not believe it was coming to an end. Needless to mention, everybody made us feel at home, staff, friendly, rooms absolutely spotless with actual real hot water shower every day, (can say the same for other resorts that we have been) PLUS a BIG PLUS..! ..NO mosquitos, NO hen-hen sand flees, we could assist their nightly shows, without being EATEN alive by mosquitos, my wife is allergic to their bites and presents a ''real pain''. Here we were able to enjoy  their incredible ''Las Vegas'' show;5
This was our 12th visit to Cuba, but 1st time staying at Club Amigo Corales Los Carisol in Santiago de Cuba. We had a good time, but will not return.  The 3rd day of our holiday, the Corasol closed, this meant we only had one buffet, 2  a la cartes.  RESORT -  has LOTS of potential, but needs LOTS of TLC                -  the grounds were kept clean of garbage and debris ...                 -  however, saying that, there was an assortment of animal feces on the grounds as animals of all sorts,(cattle, horses, goats, sheep, dogs ....) wonder thru the resort.  ROOMS -  we stayed in one of the bungalows, very simple,dated and tired looking.               -  we had a wonderful lady named Dahlia who kept everything clean.               -  A/C worked well (but noisy), lots of hot;2
Went to Santiago de Cuba to Club Amigo Cariso Los Corales in March and had an excellent time as always  The hotel was very clean as usual and the food was very good. The staff was extremely friendly and couldn't do enough for us. Everyone from the front desk to the waiters and waitress, the chambermaids to the grounds keepers and the kitchen staff.Marleidis in public relations was there to help you with whatever you needed . During the day you can have lunch at the newly renovated beach restaurant, run by a very wonderful waitress named Surame and at  night you can go to the Cuban restaurant that is run by Milco ,who is very friendly and entertaining .The hotel also offers snorkelling , a shuttle into the city of Santiago , swimming with dolphins, the alligator farm and a night;5
We frequent Carisol-Los Corales at least twice a year. The staff are always super friendly, our rooms are always clean and everything is in working condition. The food is always good and there are always options for everyone! I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to go to Cuba. The staff is one of the most amazing groups of people I have ever met!;5
I was in this hotel the last march .I was sooo happy  .the food and the personal from the hotel is soo nice .The beach and all the activities from the hotel make us to feel like in our home .We want to come back soon the .The people from the hotel soo profesional.we really enjoyed;5
Traveled to this hotel in march of 2016.   After reading all the negative reviews I was very concerned about going to this hotel but being a Cuba veteran I read a lot of these reviews with a grain of salt and decided for the price how could i go wrong.  Here is a very unbiased review of the resort that you can trust from someone who has been to Cuba a dozen times and understands cuba travel.  The resort  The resort itself is a very standard Cuba 3 star resort and i did not have any complaints about the resort itself.   The rooms were basic but clean and except for seeing 1 small geiko the first night there were no bugs in my room.     The Beach  The beach is not very nice as in its very shallow and the beach is covered in rocks and shells that i am assuming is due to hurricane;3
Staff very nice and helpful. Off season. Only 1 buffet open. Food ran out if not there right when opened. Cat got ripped apart by stray pack hotel dogs in buffet. Guests horrified. Waiter swept up with broom. Had to change room immediately. To upper level. Hole in sink, ect tiles. LOTS of reptiles and spiders. Got a Spectacular  Cuban Rock Lobster feast dinner outside resort with wonderful locals, Lily. Had a great time regardless. Laid back vacationers. Great weather.;2
This area of Cuba is a dessert it's extremely hot in the winter.  Second the beach is public therefore you items can go missing this did not happen to me but it happened to some guest.  Third the local dogs have access to the property GUEST feed them and they in turn come into the dining room and eating area also cows goats sheep  etc I would not recommend this spot unless the following you are on an extremely tight budget you don't do excursions you need quiet area to write or journal you are an avid camper and love being close to nature.  If you don't fit into any of these criteria then go else where this hotel is terrible;2
I spent 6 days at this resort, I have to say it is definatly not a 5 star. The food and buffet needs major work. BUT...The people and staff make up for it. I have travelled much, I had a client/friend tell me about this hotel, Ursula Simpson, she was right, I had a amazing fun time here. I have never in all my travels met so many beautiful, kind people. If you want to just go relax, scuba dive or simply hide away from the world on a tight budget, great fun here! Bring ketchup and perhaps your extra little package of meals. Because you cannot count of the food qaulity.  The locals love things like, shoes, candy, panty hose, and childrens items. I made a excellent friend there!! FYI...Thanks for the jello shooter....you know who you are!!! Yummy!;3
we went mar 9 - 23 had a great vacation dont understand some of the reviews but each to their own, we thought the food was fine great omelettes in morning good pizza at lunch we preferred buffet over a la carte at supper, room was clean but not fancy, ac and hot water worked staff is wonderful beach is gravelly but has some snorkeling so its ok, they need more gardening help to pick up after animals that wander about but its not a big deal,  no line ups for drinks lots of loungers around pool and beach we have been to 5 stars that are all marble and tile and huge resorts in mexico but who cares we got two weeks here for less than i have paid for one, we will be going back  for two weeks next winter i hope  , hopefully the whiners will keep up with bad reviews and help keep;4
"When you read the mock up that sunwing post on their site you would think ""not a bad place to stay""  but it is not a three star not even a 2.  The staff for the most part try very hard to please you, the manager doesn't even try, he is always to busy to overworked or can not be bothered with you.  We have stayed in Cuba so many times I call it my second home and I have stayed at some pretty unusual places, I will never go back to this resort (I have a hard time calling it a resort).  The food : We joked with another couple that the flies and birds must eat first and then the staff and what is left is for the paying tourist.  I watched more than a few times as staff would put fruit and other items in their cupboards before the patrons even were served.(fruit at breakfast was not";1
A friend and I stayed at the 3* Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales for two weeks in Feb 2016. We flew Cubana Airlines from Montreal to Santiago de Cuba, stopping in Camaguay on the return flight to pick up passengers.  The flight was comfortable. There were no TVs for viewing but a complimentary snack and beverages were served in flight. Upon arrival at the airport, two staircases were attached to the front and rear of the plane for deboarding.  Transfer to the resort was comfortable. We had time to exchange money into CUCs at the airport.  We learned, while on the bus, that when you book at Carisol Los Corales, the hotel assigns which section you will be given a room UNLESS you contact the hotel directly via your travel agent by special request or yourself. We discovered that the;3
Background: We paid $568 including tax per person and did not have high expectations.  We wanted some decent food, decent service, relax and go visit Santiago.  This was our third time in Cuba.   SUMMARY: the resort has potential and could easily be better if management would improve by doing very simple things that cost nothing.  Beach and Pool were nice.  Trip to Santiago was nice.  If you need anything go outside Corales resort and look/ask for Luis a local Cuban from Santiago with shaved head.  He's great we went into town with him and he can get you anything you'd like.  Cuba is safe and cheap to explore so do so.  Food was edible but not great.  If you'd like info in greater detail read on.  The Good and the Bad The location is about 1 hour from the airport.    CHECK-IN;3
My husband and I have recently returned from our two week stay and we were extremely pleased.  We wish to praise Public Relations, Marleidis Jimenez for taking her role seriously.  She provided prompt assistance when required.  Ms. Jimenez makes every effort to mingle daily with tourists, with a smile, and impeccably attired.;5
We return from Corales on March 16, wonderful week during March break. We read all previous reviews and we knew about some issues with problems with plates or something else. And we glad that we took the risk! Hot sunny weather, Relax on the beach and in the pool. Very nice working people. Yes, a lots of things can be done to improve the business there, but if you concentrate on your vacation and great family time - YOU FEEL HAPPY! We paid $605 with tax for each adult. AMAZING GETAWAY!!! We took private tour to the city on the Ford year 1956! WOW! Ford, Cathedral - MUST TO SEE. Santiago De Cuba - a pearl in Caribbean. Give it a try!;4
manager very rude. some staff are nice. no actives by staff. no pool volleyball, beach volleyball, darts. When I asked about all the listed activities the lady was very quite to say It was only her. She did nothing but Spanish lesson and at about 4 o:clock she did play one game with the kids. Meet a lot of nice tourists. So we made up our own fun.;2
Booked this hotel through Sunwing. We reserved a ocean view bungalow that was an absolute nightmare. Sewer gas in room with human feces running down the inside of our shower from toilet on the 2nd floor. Bed sheets that did not fit the mattress. Door handle that did not work and we got locked in our room. No water, no hot water and the list goes on and on and on. A real dump. Dont get me wrong, we have been to Cuba 12 times in the past 5 years and we know what to expect. This takes the cake. You cannot get any worst. Sunwing copy and pasted a response 3 months after our complaint (5 of our family members) went on this vacation and we were refunded $200 total off a $6000 vacation.;1
I'm thinking the reason people come to Los Corales is the price and the incredible weather. The folk that give this place a good score are usually the repeat customers, they are aware of the pitfalls and work around them. If you come here for an all inclusive Caribbean vacation for the first time, you might be in for a let down. We have been to Cuba many times but this is probably our last. Our ocean view bungalow had a wonderful view with a large patio, two chairs and a broken lounger. The room itself is spartan, the beds extremely hard, we had two chairs with one broken. It was clean and the bathroom was okay. The food, as usual, is not going to impress you .....it's pretty well the same every day, however the bread selection is always good. The pizza and pasta  is a popular;2
"The term ""Resort"" for this place is a bit of a stretch.  It's more of a Cuban prison with a decent pool and free drinks so you can last the week in an altered state.  I spent most of the week looking forward to my release date.  Without a doubt, this place is Castro's attempt at humor to see if the imperialist masses would pay to come on vacation to a place that's only slightly above a biological waste dump in terms of sanitary conditions.  First, for much of the visit, the water in the room didn't work.  When that happened, the  toilet and the shower were non-functional, including on the last day when it might have been nice to have a shower for the trip home.    If you're into wildlife, this is the place to go.  There's no shortage here, including the cockroaches in the room";1
"I feel a bit perverse being the bearer of good news, but we spent 2 weeks at Corales recently and thought it was a great holiday. The weather was hot and dry and sunny; just the way we like it. The ocean was the warmest I've experienced, feeling at times like bath water. Our bungalow room was clean and roomy. I had low expectations for the food, and I was not disappointed. Having said that, I always found something good to eat.  Certainly, the guest demographic was a tad on the elderly side; though there were a number of families with kids, too. And try chatting with some of those grumpy looking oldsters and be prepared to be amazed at the diversity of history behind those faces. I thought that the dogs, present on the beach and even in the lobby and restaurant, were over all, a";4
Like my wife Luba M,said,we keep going back to this hotel because of the location and a beautiful weather.People are very nice, warm and friendly, trying to please their guest,not always easy.I just like to add few more things,.Thanks again to Anna for keeping our room fresh and clean.

Been to this hotel few times. Stay from feb.4 to march 3.been to  Cuba 17 times,Also travel many cruises, Europe,Bahamas,Mexico,Hawaii,Florida,Dominican R,Antigua,Panama just few of many more.So i have something to compere to.This resort made many changes.  Was devastated by hurricane Sandy in 2013.Build new beach restaurant,last one was destroy by hurricane,new bar on the beach with very friendly staff.Drinks served with smile.Also you can get beach towels,from 10-5 on the beach.Very friendly lady works there.My husband by mistake give his shorts and hat with the towels,she give it back to us the next day.Thanks for your honesty.Beach was also clean thanks to Ernesto.Yes was shortage of the chair,because people put towels and scarf on them and don't come to sit on them.

Presently at this resort leaving March 9 th can't wait to get out of this DUMP,food is in very short supply often run out of meat all dishes are the same garbage cut in different ways but all the same public washrooms have no toilet paper.bars constantly run out of beer or vodka or coffee cups beach is no where as good as many others in Cuba severe shortage of dishes,no napkins etc for 3 days then on arrival cut into small pieces then A donkey comes into the restaurant a hundred coats on resort horses cows roaming in resort unreal I have photos to back up all claims if you Havel travel insurance use it Sunwing should be ashamed to offer this to Canadians.Weather Was great on the positive side what an adventure.;1
"Stayed at this resort 12 years ago, and although it was not fancy, there was enough food and a good variety.  This hotel has really gone downhill.  We saw a great deal of theft of food by the workers.  Fruit and vegetables were scarce, food was horrible. Tongue on buffet and liver on the grill three times.  Lines for everything fresh cooked such as chicken, pork or eggs. Cooks only cooked to order, instead of having the grill full when they opened. Had to wait for plates, glasses and coffee. Drinks were made with all powdered ""juice"".  Service was overall terrible, but some shining stars.  Pool liners was ripped and bottom spongy. Weather and sea were great though.";2
We stayed here for one week in Feb. We found the room was clean. Staff was friendly. Location was good as it is  in a quiet area away from the town. The beach was decent. We enjoyed our stay as a nice place to have a relaxed holiday.  Contrary to some the negative reviews we read on TripAdvisor  we found that the  hotel was very decent. Rooms were specious and clean. The place had many repeat customers and some of the guest were staying there  for almost the whole season.   Lobby area, dining rooms pool and beach area  all  were very clean and reasonably  well maintained.  Room itself was  cleaned everyday and there was good maid service.  The food was not bad at all but lacked variety. (This is not the place to expect gourmet dining). The  water is drinkable (no need for;3
room was average  there are 5 bar 2  buffet   24 HRS service  beach are poor  beach bar with very good service weather was hoot front desk staff was ok I have been there over 25 time I steel like the place and I will go back;3
"As  Adriyyz said: well her and I are connected with Carisol and Los Corales with about 12 Februarys since 2001 and have sent about 1000 clients to this location. My wife and I own TRAVEL ONE in Toronto. Since our 1st trip in 2001, I always said this Resort was Pearl in the rough, as most of our clients agreed, that's they kept on going back and also the price, some clients stayed for four, six and eight weeks.         I have to say that Cuban are fantastic people and educated, when you're having a conversation with ""MOST"" Cubans, you are actually having an intelligent conversation with a person. Most of our Politicians could learn from them.        NOW> This year was the worst year and experience at Carisol and Los Corales. Starting with Alejandro the front desk manager (He";1
Don't stay at this dreadful place at any cost. The rooms are very shabby, door to balcony didn't have a lock on it, the A/C was less than a metre from my ear whilst in bed. The curtains hanging down, the bathroom was an utter disgrace, with mastic around the sink and shower tray that must have been done by a 4 year old, dreadful workmanship. Drinks all served in plastic flimsy cups, inside as well as outside, although, what masqueraded as a restaurant, served wine in glass glasses. Food disgusting, poorly laid out, poor selection, sloppy staff, who took no interest at all. Don't stay here at any cost.you will be very disappointed . My recommendation for this hovel is demolition and a total rebuild. Staying here will ruin you holiday and your overall view of Cuba.;1
Ok We read the reviews and majority of the complaints we laughed at. We knew it wouldnt bother us, and we hoped for the best! WE ARE GLAD WE DID!!!!!!!!! To be honest the things that we would complain were not worth an extra MINIMUM thousand dollars +++++++ to stay else where. This hotel is for the economic vacationer, who likes a nice beach and pool.... warm weather.  PROS: Our rooms were cleaned everyday always shampoo, soap and toilet paper for us too!  Right by the beach!! WHICH WAS BEAUTIFUL (wear water shoes!) the ocean was AWESOME CLEAR, great shells, clean, LOTS of water life to explore!!!!! warm! It had bars for drinks, boats to go on example peddle boats, kayaks..... LOTS of chairs and loungers!!!  24/7 Security although there was nothing to be worried about*** the;4
This was a last minute booking to Corales, Santiago de Cuba, due to a change in the 90 day stability  travel insurance clause. Every one else decided to book that week too as Valentine’s and Family Day ran together in Ontario! Flew Holasun out of Pearson on time. At check in my second bag of luggage popped its top and Hola tagged it and had me plastic wrap it! Sent off through oversized luggage. Oh, Oh! What’s Aduna going to say about this.  Flight was on time and comfortable. Good snack going, lousy coming back. The arrival at Santiago was total chaos. Aduna had their hands full and just pushed luggage thru as quickly as they could. At least 2 planes arrived simultaneously, carousel broke down 3x and staff was overwhelmed. Money changed at customs with no problems and a;2
Who ever says that this resort is great must have forgotten the first days of their arrival when they have to change 3 or 4 times the rooms because the shower does not work there is not seat on the toilet - The safe is broken - of the TV does not work or like in my case the door would not open (for 6 hours) and too many more complaints that they make when they arrive - The manager is  replying and thanking whoever has good comments on trip advisor  but if there is a problem while we are there she does not show up - The front desk manager is very rude and does not know what is going on in the back - Does not know where the rooms are located and ignores your request I saw him leaving in a hurry his front desk as soon as the bus with the new group of 60 people arrived and left only;1
Overall we spent a pleasant 2 weeks at Los Corales. The staff in general was very friendly and did a good job. Our bungalow room was very nice. No unwanted guests with the exception of one or two ants near the entrance at night, not a big deal. Our room was kept spotless by our maid. She went out of her way to make sure that we always had some fresh flowers in the room, even bringing us some small roses one day. The beach is not the best beach that I have been on but there was some nice snorkeling close to shore. We rented motor scooters and they were in very good condition and the agent was very professional and accommodating. This was our first time at an all-inclusive and we could not believe some of the greedy and obnoxious guests when it came to meal time. This made the;4
Slawomir and Danuta The rooms are cleaned daily and how much time do you spend in there during the day anyway? Felipe at front desk always help if any problem. Fernando make excellent coffee and drinks.I always recommend to my friend this hotel and for sure I be back next year.The weather is always good and people friendly.;5
Bungalow rooms were leaking brown dirty water on our head when it rained. Cockroaches, lizards in your room and a rat, yes a rat falling from floor above onto our balcony. Public washroom have no toilet seat, no toilet paper, no soap to wash your hand and no towel to dry your hands. Some toilet doesn't even have a light. You have to fight for plates, cutlery in the dinning area and chairs. People actually throwing bread at each other due to shortage of food. Staff hygiene is non existent. Witness a staff on the lobby bar eating and washed his hand in the water supply to the ice maker. I also saw another staff eating from the guest Buffett double dip the potato wedge that he bit once and then dipped into the sauce on the platter of ground beef on the buffet table. Cows, goats,;1
Have been going to Cuba for 13 years and have have been to many resorts and this one have been the best for the past 4 years. I highly recommend this resort for the people, food, actives ect. I highly recommend it to all. Thank you Corolas!!!;5
People make the difference, just not always for the positive.I did not expect much as I did not pay a whole lot for this trip, however, half way decent food is something I do expect to have available. I went in knowing full well that this is a three star resort but I don't understand how it achieved that rating. I believe this is two star at best. There are all kinds of wrong here, as I'm sure you can read from the other reviews, so I'll keep it short and simple. Go somewhere else !! Not one person I met while there said they would return. Beach is rocky so bring water shoes. The animals walking around are cool as far as i'm concerned. The outside workers go around every morning and clean up dung, not a big deal for me. Book as many a la carte's as possible. If you're already;2
Rooms/Resort  Arriving to our rooms.  The bungalow rooms were in extremely poor condition (every second tile on the floor was chipped, paint peeling off the walls etc) and one of the rooms air conditioner did not work.  The minibar, that the website states, was just a fridge with no water or drinks inside.  When I asked the maid to fill it with some water and beer, she said it is not included.  This, in my opinion is a bit of false advertising.  I paid extra for this advertised service.    As for the patrons at the resort, they were mostly elderly, rude people.  If we had known that the average age was over 70, we would have chosen a different resort to bring our kids to their first all-inclusive resort.  Disappointing.   Food and Drink.  Never in my travels have I had to buy;1
We stayed 14 days in Jan 2016, weather was to dream about, beach fantastic. Now about the food, open air buffet, birds, bird crap on you and your food, dogs everywhere but not intrusive, just hungry. No real hot food at buffet, cold food was at room temperature and above, almost dangerous for our health, the only time real variety was when the bosses were on sight, Then there was different food, toilet paper in commun areas and the personnel were on their toes. The best food and service was at the Shack near beach (hot dogs, hamburgers, fried chicken) and the Pizza restaurant for pizza and pasta, excellent food and service but only during day. The chef was extremely professional and would prepare food to the way you like it. Super cool dude.  The hotel should try to find a way;3
"Nothing like a stay at Carisol Los Corales for lessons about scarcity and resourcefulness. I'm not talking about the Cuban neighbours-- we've been to the island many times and are familiar with their adaptability. No, I'm referring to the resort guests. Take chairs, for example, because that's what they do: take chairs. First day at the beach, we found nearly every lounger ""reserved"" with a towel, book, blanket, air mattress, rope, maybe trip wires and motion detectors, even though many were empty. Finally, we found a free chair that we dragged to a tiny bit of shade near an impromptu bocce court. Of course, we're not unfamiliar with the towel game, so the next day, figuring ""When in Cuba, do as the Roman-Canadians,"" we got up at dawn and reserved a pair of chairs under a";1
"We have just returned from our third trip to this resort.  While we had a great time, unfortunately the resort is starting to show it's age and lack of maintenance.  None is the fault of the resort - at least in my opinion.  It is a Cuba owned and operated resort, as are all the Club Amigo resorts; hence funding for improvements is very scarce.  So much could be done to turn this into a 4 star resort.  The staff continue to be wonderful.  It never fails to amaze me that they remember us from year to year - and we missed last year!  They are  what makes this place so great.  While we never gave much thought to the ""open air"" restaurants, our travel companions were aghast!  Thinking about the birds and dogs and cats that frequent the restaurants, it is very unsanitary.  The food";3
Feb 2016 My mom (65) and I (43) Last minute get away ROOM 511 AC worked well Pillow sucks!  One per bed.  I'm sure the bathrooms differ but ours had a shower head from hell and we couldn't regulate the water temp so be careful.  Same with the bathroom sink.   Things they don't tell you.... Safe key...2$ canadian per day pd upfront  Towels are 20 cuc ea  if not returned...found at beach tent by the beach.  Bring a beach towel. Beach is between both resorts.  Quite the walk for elderly or people with difficulties.  Don't leave anything, including your towel,  unattended. There is a Cuban guy who tries to control the chairs at the beach... This guy will take your resort towels if you leave them on your chair and then when he notices your looking he'll say he has no idea but he has;2
"Had to wait 3 days for the short in the light switch in the bathroom to be repaired; it's like they were waiting for someone to get a shock off of it first. Food, liquor and beer continually being smuggled out; guess who pays for all this. The food was always cold as it seemed that the warming trays were never on. The best meal was omelet in the morning and the fish was great. During the 28 days I was there we had bananas once, papaya 4X, pine apple 12 X and pre sliced oranges and grape fruit sitting under plastic wrap for the rest. This resort has gone down hill very fast and it seems to be someone's 'experiment' to see how much they can cut back and still have people come back. The weather was great and most of the staff fantastic I was thanked many times for coming back by";2
My friend and I went here from Jan 28 - Feb 4, 2016. Although many people were not impressed/satisfied with their stay here, we had a great time. We are not picky people and just wanted to get away for nice weather and relaxation so it was perfect. The pool area was really nice and clean - we spent the majority of our time there. The beach was also nice - snorkeling is a must!! The employees were very kind and helpful. Food was okay, not much variety between days but altogether it wasn't horrible.  Overall, if you're looking for a resort with nice rooms and comfortable beds, this isn't the place for you. If you spend the whole day outside in the sun and don't really care about the room conditions then this place is perfect. The weather was awesome the whole week - even when it;4
"We chose this resort because of the location. It's right on the Caribbean ocean, so the weather was amazing! The staff was very friendly and helpful, but the resort itself was in poor repair.  No mosquitos but there were bedbugs.  The food was very limited and it was hard to find something we enjoyed( this is not our first time to Cuba, so we are aware of the food). The pool's liner was leaking so the pool level dropped about 10-12"" in the week we were there.  The people were amazing but the overall experience wasn't that wonderful. We won't be going back.";2
"I just came back from this resort; travelled with a friend.  We go every year to the same place, because you can not beat the price and the temperature is always the best here. When Varadero had +23 Santiago de Cuba had +30.  The resort itself not too bad. Staff very friendly.  Food is horrible though, we always take a few of the can food with us. Room is not fancy and this time the shower had was not working. Also we had no safe in the room!  Lots of our things got stolen from our luggage. My friend's new jeans, shirt. My Adidas baseball cap, Fila sweater, swim short, colone and a new headphone. Complained at the front desk, they said they are going to talk to security and look into it, but nothing happened. I was yelling at reception not to send house keeping to our room any";3
Well we went back for the third time to Club Amigo, we again stayed on the Los Corales side, we had a group of 17.  Some were new comers some have been there before.  The people who were there for the first time are already making plans for next year.  The whole group had such a great time, the employees of this resort are so pleasant that it makes the trip even more wonderful.  I hope to have an even bigger group next year.  Thank you to all the bartenders, maids and all employees of this resort.  We will see you all next year.!!!!;4
Beautiful beaches, wonderful staff who will go that extra mile Old buildings with great historic flavour in the village  I would recommend this for people who would like to relax and chill Fine dining and great deserts with coffee from their native land;5
Travelled with Sunwing. We were booked at the lower 2.5 star Costa Morena and were told when we got on the bus to resort that we would be going to Carisol 6 kms. away from our friends we were meeting at C.M...an up-grade plus a free excursion( told wrong date and missed excursion along with 3 other guests but will take the issue up with Sunwing) for the inconvenience , cool ! So we thought ! Check-in was smooth and fairly quick . The grounds were well kept . Room was average except for the huge cockroaches (photo) this is a big issue for me and caused great lack of sleep ! The tarantula(photo) in our room was more welcome ! , asked to have room sprayed 3 separate times to no avail ! There was no hairdryer (not an issue for me) Noise level was not an issue as nightly;2
Hotel staff are always ready to help you and always with a nice smile.  They will be pleased to help you learn a bit of Spanish....Because the hotel is south of the large mountain chain, the warm weather and sunshine is present most of the time... Better weather than Varadero.  When you travel, if you expect the same comfort as home... Think twice before coming to the Los Corales... It is normal on the resort to lack some specific fruit juice for few days, or loose the toaster for repair some other days or have no CUC cash at the front desk... These little inconveniences, are part of the day to day life of a very poor section of Cuba. The strength of the Los Corales is the chance to face the real Cuban culture through the staff and villages around the resort...   If you like;4
the Hotel is very old and not well kept. food is NOT good they run out of food. if you can bring food from home.  This is survivor at its best . Not hot water for a showers or hair dryer so bring your owe. They was never a sun wing  representatives around when you need them. the people at the front desk didn't care about your issue.  animals everywhere i am not a fan. Great life lesson for kids to see how poor people are .;1
We returned after a memorable stay last year, and again we had a good time. A rustic experience to be sure. The farm-like premises are not too everyone's liking- animals of all ilk roam the grounds. Yes there is poop about, and yes there are birds and dogs in the restaurants. The dogs we didn't mind so much, but the birds flying around while eating left one a little uneasy for obvious reasons. Rumour has it they are looking to remedy the latter issues by enclosing and putting in A/C. We both noticed that the food is not as good as last year, but of course you won't go hungry. The beach is nice and the surrounding scenery beautiful, and staff are friendly. We liked to tip staff who we found especially helpful but it is not expected. At the price we paid it was a very welcome;4
If you are single going with a bunch of guys or over 60 and want to stay for a long time. Really not picky about what you eat then you should stay here.  If you enjoy comfort and are going with a family and like entertainment I would not stay here. I could list all the negatives but I will not if you read the other poor reviews they were pretty spot on about this place. I guess I'm a Mexico lover at heart.  So, Positives the Piazza at the Carisol property just plain out awesome! Only Meals I had all week. (Pizza and Pasta) and cucumbers. The chef and waiting staff were exceptional.The Pool bar at the Los Corales Property Francesco and Ivon are the best the property have to offer. They are the best and the resort does not appreciate them. They will impress you and I bet they;2
Only reason we booked this place was for a landing spot to start owr road trip. cheaper to book this place than to just get a flight.Unfortunatly we had to stay the first night, my spouse has asmha so we take precautions with that but we couldn't stay in this room from the get go, room 422, so much mold in the closet and bathroom that it wasn't feasible. plus the room had not been cleaned from the previous guest. YUCK! still cant believe how some people live, but, not my problem. went to the check in desk and was told there were no other rooms avalible, staying in it was not an option. So we got the hotel doctor to visit the room and she also deemed it un-reasonable to stay in it. Cleaners were brought in to make it safe for the night till we could get a better room the next;1
This hotel is the most southern hotel on the island. Took about an hour from the Santiago airport. Had to wait awhile to get going..little frustrating but once we did, it was a nice drive along the coast of the Caribbean Sea. They were ready for our bus and was quickly checked in. Nice rooms. Basic. Fridge didn't work but no big deal. OK channels...even CTV Canada. Open our doors straight to big pool with nice pool bar. Lots of daily entertainment. Kept the kids busy. Beach is nice...a little rocky but there are good spots. snorkeling, paddle boats, canoes..locals are down a bit further and have anything you may be looking for from cigars to women..There are 2 resorts there for which you can go back and forth and use both facilities...pool, bars and restaurants, store..kinda;3
Just returned for a week, with my family and friends. We celebrated my wife's 50th birthday. Thanks Francisco and maybe for a great time. This was my wife and mine 2nd time to the resort and things have are getting fixed up after the hurricane in 2012.  I would suggest bringing some spice for the food, pretty bland. Pizza and Pasta at lunch was great. Don't be afraid to ask to help out to shrink the lines. If you are expecting a 5 star don't go but if you don't mind a few minor issues and great people and drinks I would suggest this resort.;4
"(Stayed at the Los Corales part of the resort)  WEATHER: Went there for the first time in January 2016 and it was by far the best weather I've had in Cuba for that time of the year and it's always like that apparently.   FOOD: There is good omelettes at breakfast and meat (fish, pork, chicken) on the grill at lunch and dinner. Fruits are always fresh as they cut them in front of you. We had amazing lobster at the restaurant just 2 minutes outside the ""Las Corales"" part of the resort. It might look intimidating to go but it's definitely worth it. There is 2 or 3 restaurants that you can walk to but the one we tried is the one by the beach where all the locals go. It looks like a little shack but the owner takes really good care of the customers and the food is super tasty (Ask";4
This hotel, while situated in a very panoramic part of southern Cuba in the mountains of the southern side of the isle and Caribbean Sea,  is quite rustic in style with stone construction and very good staff. It still requires some room updating as repairs are in order for some of the rooms.  There are actually 2 hotels that you can walk between and enjoy the services of both similarly styled accomodations, pool and buffet restaurants.  The beach is nice but a bit tricky to swim in due to the sea grasses and limited sand bars beneath.  Very good scuba and fishing opportunities though and coral reef in the bay.  There are reasonably priced taxi services to the city itself for the sites and take an hour by car.  Sharing a classic car amongst 3 or 4 people will half your costs;4
Just returned from another wonderful week at Los Corales.  This was my second time and hubby's third.  We were not dissapointed.  Food was plentiful and always something to please everyone.  If you are expecting Filet Mignon 5 star style then you should stick with Jamaica and the other pricey destinations.  Cuba is known for the warmth of their people and beautiful countryside and this hotel does not dissapoint.  The staff is amazing from the maids to gardeners to the managment.  Room was cleaned to perfection every day.  (thanks Ana)  I really have no complaints for the trip other than it was too short.  Will be going back in April for 2 weeks.  Flew with Cubana and flights were good and love the extra luggage.  If you are looking for a peaceful and relaxing getaway then this;4

Ok so...just got back....literally! Was a good week. Our first time to Cuba and only our second all inclusive ( Mexico was the first) Location....Awesome...Ocean....amazing and the kids and hubby had a blast snorkelling right off the beach. Beach is NOT white soft sand, its coral so sturdy beach shoes should be worn both in and out of the water. The bottom is also full of Sea Urchins too so beware. Room was clean and served its purpose however it may take all 4 of us a week or so to feel our spines again. A good soak in the amazing ocean seemed to help and my teen says the massage she had was terrific so there are ways to help that. Staff was great for the most part and were always helpful. Do not go with high expectations and you wont be disappointed. The flies and birds are;3
I feel like a broken record, after having written what feels like a billion Cuba resort reviews, and this is no exception!  I have now been going to Cuba for 40 years, been all over Cuba and as such, know what to expect.  If you want excellent weather, a nice beach (warm water although in many areas, you will need water shoes), pleasant service-oriented staff, then this is the place for you.  If however, you are a foodie, go, but please go, but not with any great food expectations.  I don't go to Cuba for the food and never have, and have learned to bring my protein with me by way of tinned tuna, nuts, etc.    The meals are ok at the buffet but the line ups at the grill were long.  The pizza place line up at lunch time was also long but well worth it - kudos to our pizza staff!;3
Just came back yesterday from a beautiful warm 2 weeks!!! Most of the staff were very nice!!! Our cleaning lady amazing!!! The food was not as great this time!!! But beware this time a lot of people got some stuff stolen so if you are going soon watch your stuff!!!!;3
We just returned from our 3rd visit to Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales. We stayed from November 25 to December 9. We usually visit in January and were actually pleased with the low number of people at this time of year compared to January. There was no fighting for a beach chair and the lineups at the buffets weren't quite so long. We noticed a number of improvements since our last visit this past January 2015. The beach is continually being cleaned up and looks better. They have installed new lamp posts along the walkway between Carisol and Corales which makes it much nicer in the evening. The beach restaurant that was being started last January is now complete and operational. The tile floors are quite nice and they serve hamburgers, hot dogs and ham sandwiches along with a;4
"Dec 3rd-Dec 10th vacation .For what we've paid we've got a great vacation!Nice weather , for 7 days we enjoyed paradise! Room 317: basic,not fancy or modern VERY clean ,conf. bed & good pillows , big balcony,hot water all the time .Wifi : I dont know , no FB or internet needs while on vacation. Beach: a bit rocky, no white sand but is ok, we knew ,the prb  is that were only few spots to walk into the ocean , they have to to clean the beach  , is a beautiful spot for vacations but not much ""space"" to swim ( seaweed all over), great location for snorkeling !near to the shore are million of colorful fishes .palm trees on the beach , you can spend there all day !Location : super quiet,near to the amazing mountains.Resort is clean,proper .Food : not many choices but enough to eat";4
everything was great except the food. my wife and I have been all over Cuba and we have low expectations of food in this country but this place is at the very bottom of the list. If you like hotdogs cooked all different ways then this is the place for you.;1
We really enjoyed our week here. It was relaxing and relatively quiet (Los Corales). Staff were genuinely friendly and most spoke English. The food was good, but not great. The beach is a bit rugged—swim footwear is recommended. It can get windy at times, but you can escape to the pool.;4
Inexpensive, basic hotel offering clean rooms. Food is so,so but hey it is Cuba. Staff very friendly and speak English, French, German and Italian.  The weather is always good. You are about 60 minutes from Santiago. Large pool with pool bar. We have stayed here many times and have enjoyed it every time. There was a few renovations taking place in November.;3
"I understand from the many people that had returned for their umpteenth visit to this resort that it was a very nice place to visit. My wife and I have been to Cuba many times and return for the atmosphere; the people and culture are as warm as the climate - we are not expecting 5 star treatment at a 3 star resort. We met some wonderful people again this trip - good thing or the trip would have been a disaster. The management at this resort need to do some simple math ... more people show up ... you need more food and you need more servers. It was ridiculous at some points; a single cook on a half sized skillet with thirty people lined up for eggs, a single cook at the pasta and pizza oven trying to keep up to a line up of people without anyone even trying to help her,";1
We went their for our second time Jan 26 - Feb 2/14.  This time we brought another couple with us.  We all had a great time, the place is clean, hospitable and beautiful.  We stayed on the Los Corales side.  We found the staff to be very friendly.  This year we are going in a group of 15.  We loved it so much we recommended to our friends.;5
"A Last minute escape to get some ""color"", natural vitamins to boost your immunity and soul!  We went February 2014. Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales is located in the very south of Cuba. It is always beautiful and sunny (hot) not like Varadero that can be cold in the early winter months (Jan, Feb). This resort is about 60 minutes from airport so if you do not like the ""typical bus rides in Cuba"" don't go there. It is in the ""poorest"" region. There is nothing around it. There is an excursion into Town that they do which is part of your package. You really get the local feel of the region. The ride is nice, you just chill and view the ""amazon like"" mountains while sipping on a nice cold Corona which you can get at the hotel.  The hotel is made up of two storeys little housing, not";4
I suggest you read all of this:   This place is nice (nice pool, food, rooms, etc), however completely dead in low season. If you like any kind of night life DO NOT GO HERE. The show was pretty bad, the disco was destroyed by a hurricane, and the only local dancing club outside the place was local cubans dancing evil seances (and was only 1 night a week). If you want to sit at the bar alone while the bar tender blasts some songs.. that was it for the evening. Also, strangely enough our entire resort got sick (the air there was bad). The entire bus ride was coughing badly and I myself had to get on antibiotics (and I have never gotten sick in the 25 years I have been going to Cuba).   The service staff were all very cold… or just seemed unhappy. I heard that the tourists there;3
"Thousands of people have read my January 2014 review of this hotel I titled ‘Help, there are cows in the tennis court’. In it I praised the hotel for being rustic and remote. The resort consists of two hotels; Los Corales which is older and closer to the beach and Carisol which is neater and cleaner, but not as well situated. People staying at either resort can share each others' facilities. Both have excellent pools, the Tiendas shops have a small supplies of water, rum, snacks, clothing and souvenirs.  This year (2015) the mosquitoes (which are quite small compared to the Muskoka variety) were very bad. I react very poorly to Canadian mosquitoes but tolerated the Cuban variety quite well. I finally realized they were coming in under the air conditioner and from the vent in the";4
I had a great time at Los Corales Carisol. The staff are very eager to please.. Although the food can get repetitive there is always something to attract you. The Italian pasta and pizza bar was a nice find. I also enjoyed all the fresh fruit every morning. I would suggest bringing your own hot sauces and condiments from home but this is no surprise to anyone who has been to Cuba before. I love the location of this resort. The mountains in the background and the Caribbean out front made it ideal. The snorkelling was wonderful.;3
This review has taken some thought because we generally view life with the glass half full attitude rather than the half empty one. This resort challenged that philosophy. This place has some issues but nothing that would prevent us from going again if we got a good deal .  We sort of have a love/hate impression of this place. Yes there were some issues but they  didn't   ruin our holiday because we didn't let  it .  Coles notes version of the review... of the three Club Amigo properties we have visited this place would rank # 3 because of the food issue  to be discussed later.   As the season winds down for this resort ( I believe it fully  closes down in two weeks until Nov. The Carisol  half of this resort was already closed )  Its hard to accurately give a true assessment;3
I arrived at this hotel on the 9 of april 2015, on the first night, i had money stolen from my wallet in my rooms. No one help me with that. The reception call the security and they said to me these things never happen before ! I also had my flight ticket stollen.;1
I wasn't going to post, because of the accuracy of the posts in general, but after a few very negative ones, I felt compelled to post my view.  Ten members of our extended family, including three youths, visited this resort for a week over the Easter long weekend.  It was the last weekend flying into the resort through Sunwing from Toronto, as the season winds down.  My biggest complaint is that they managed to cancel the free trip into Santiego de Cuba without notice, and subsequently cancel the excursion we booked and paid for which then compelled two of us to rent a cab for a day trip, and the rest of the group to forego the experience because of logistics and the discomfort of riding in a cab vs. and air-conditioned bus  A bit of background, my husband and I have traveled to;4
I stayed at this resort in March for 8 days. This was my first time flying into Santiago de Cuba, and it was perfect right from the departure from the plane! I got off of the jet, and the heat just felt amazing after a long Canadian winter! We were in and out of the airport within 30 minutes. The buses were waiting to take us to the resort. There were several people directing you toward your bus. They are so helpful! The drive to the resort was breathtaking. The buildings, and homes, the horses, donkeys and goats. The schools, buildings and playground were unlike anything I have ever seen. You are on the bus for about 20-30 minutes before the Caribbean Sea comes into view. And it's stunning! Another great thing about this location, is that it's so far south in Cuba, that you are;4
When we arrived we left our bags in our rooms and went for dinner. By the time we came back we had money stolen. We were two couples, both of us were robbed in our respective rooms. The 4 of us were interrogated individually until 6am. In the morning the manager said that the criminals were caught but we did not get any of our stolen money back. The criminals worked in the hotel. They are known thieves and they only take 20$ bills. Unfortunately for us, most of our money was in 20$ bills as larger bills are not accepted in Cuba. No one even bothered to apologize. No one even tried to make us for our loss with a room change, or ANY other type of compensation.   The customer service is very rude. Everyone working there is rudely demanding that you give them your clothes and other;1
We stayed at this resort during the 18 till 25 of March....Coming out of the airport it is a beautiful 1hr drive with breath taking views all the way to the resort so have your camera ready. The resort itself isn't anything fancy however for the $$ you pay it is worth it, the rooms are clean and the pools are great! Where the resort lacks the staff make up for it...they are the most friendliest workers I've ever meet always happy. The nightly shows are great and entertaining, the beach is great for tanning, snorkeling, paddle boats, swimming...be sure to bring water shoes lots of coral.  We also took the half day tour into the city and it was amazing, we also did the horse back riding tons of scenery so great for pics...The weather was excellent 34c all week log. The food was ok;3
If you're looking for a place to sit by the pool or on the beach for a good price (we paid less than $600 each), this place will do fine. This was our 7th visit to Cuba (different areas) so we didn't expect much in food quality so we weren't disappointed.   Airports:  Check-in at Montreal went very well, baggage collection in Cuba was a different story. Apparently they only have a couple baggage carts so once they fill the carts, they deliver those bags and then go back for another load. It took over an hour to get both of our bags.Outside a porter shows you a 5 or 10 peso bill and basically asks for that type of a tip. We gave him 1 peso and he was happy with it and moved on to the next passenger.   Bus Ride to resort:  The representative greeted us at the airport and mentioned;3
Fifth visit to Carisol Los Corales but the first time staying on the Carisol side. Not really much different...same tired decor, but rooms are clean and comfortable.  Food is just okay in the buffet , quite good in the Cuban a la carte. The pool and pool bar are very nice and service is friendly, quick and efficient even at the busiest times.  In general, service in all areas is good. But what happened to the ashtrays??? The main reason for visiting this area is the weather! Sunshine and 30+ every day with a welcoming breeze off the Caribbean makes you forget some of the shortcomings.;3
this was my 7th trip to Cuba, but the 1st to the Caribbean side. The weather was spectacular, 31-34 c every day, the sun went behind A cloud for 5 minutes once, the rest of the time it was perfectly clear.  so, lets start with a few negative points. The food was exactly what you should expect from a 3-3.5* in Cuba, the same every day, not very hot, & quite bland. That being said, I certainly didn't starve. My wife & 2 teenaged daughters are vegetarian & had a tough time, the biggest issue is with other guest using the spoons & tongs from a meat dish & then using the same thing in a veg dish. if you are a vegetarian or have food allergies you will want to be there when the buffet opens. The food at the Pizza & pasta restaurant (lunchtime only) was good, but VERY slow, it took at;4
Let me begin by saying that in life, you generally get what you pay for. It's like comparing a Rolex to a Timex watch. They both have numbers and dials and they both tell the time, but one is luxury pure while the other is functional. We knew going in, that this low budget trip would yield some questionable results. We were fairly certain that the weather would be favorable and that was a huge factor for us in the great white north. So that certainly got checked off the list. The weather was steadily spectacular. We heard that while we were enjoying a 24 degree evening, it was close to freezing in Varadero. But all the mental preparation in the world did little to take the edge off our initial dismay at arriving at this, as one reviewer put it, 'tired resort'. We arrived, threw;2
Having read the current reviews, I wonder if I stayed at the same resort recently!   The snorkeling at Corales has improved considerably since the destruction of the hurricane in 2012 that completely decimated Bucanero. The area abounds with reef squid, flounders, moray eels, all my little fishies I’m used to seeing and sea urchins. Even saw a little sandy coloured sea snake with white spots. A first for me. The water was warm and shallow. And the dunes were sand not snow! There are days I wonder if anyone ever reads reviews before going! I always carry my dive booties where ever I go! The best investment I have ever made. And there weren’t that many urchins. They have a reason to be on the reef too. Lots of shade on the beach. Although the lounge war continues I never had a;3
"I just returned from my 2 week stay in Cuba at this hotel and i found it was amazaing the service was good depending on your needs,the staff was so friendly they would do anything to help you.  The tikki bar has the 2 most friendly,loving bartender's (Helium & Denice) one of them takes care of the pool in the morning making sure it's always clean. The entertainment staff is always there but the shows vary to one side each night..not a lot of people wanted to join there activities like the beach volley ball or the pool volley,they even had water gym wich was fun.  I recommend bringing water shoes if you are a beach person,there is a lot of coral on the beach..  The activities like the ""free bus tour"" wasnt totaly free,the bus ride to santiago is free then they make you feel";4
"This area is blessed with very warm sea and air.  The beach, for what it was, was stony and rocky.  Further out it was very weedy but still good for exploration but not swimming.  The resort was very, very tired.  The food was very limited to poorly prepared and presented cabbage, chicken and various ill prepared fish.  You had to combat flies and birds and eventually dogs in the eating areas.  Around the compound, herds of goats, cattle and occasional donkeys wondered and you had to avoid their outcomes as well.  The staff seemed to related better to their returning guests and those who demanded much more than their share.  This is no place for polite lines or respectful behaviour--maybe that is just the outcome of ""all inclusive"".";2
"*****IMPORTANT***** Everything and anything that you don't want to have or happen in a resort you can find in this place. Damaged, run down, unhappy staff, no motivation to serve. This resort is like having a beach resort inside a war zone. The most popular phrase all employees use is ""Sorry we don't have it, the bus from Santiago broke down and never showed up with what we needed"". I love Cuba and been there multiple times in other cities. I would not recommend this resort to my worst enemy. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. Is not even worth going for free.";1
We just returned from Carisol Los Corales and the first thing that comes to mind is urgh! The beach was 'fine', the snorkeling was 'good', the food was 'poor', the property was 'lovely' and some of the guests behaviour was 'atrocious'. Honestly, if you were to ask me if I would recommend it, I would have to say NO. This is unfortunate as I believe at one time this resort was probably very lovely. I was in Cuba last year at a much smaller and more run down resort that I would recommend. My husband and I are accustomed to taking trips of 2 weeks to a month and this trip is the first time I wanted to come home after 5 days.;2
"First let me start by letting you know that it is now almost 40 years that I have been coming and staying in Cuba, all over the place, so it was with great interest that I stayed at the Carisol Los Caroles just last week - the reason being that I had stayed almost 8 years ago in the same area at the Costa Morena and had visited the Los Corales beach but not stayed.  I had absolutely no expectations which is what I totally recommend to anyone wanting to visit the ""countryside"" of Cuba, which I love.  This is true Cuba and like most of the other tourists I met while on my week's stay, they were there because they knew what to expect, a lovely beach, incredible weather and clean accommodations.  As a matter of fact, I have to say that I appreciated the repeat visitors since there";3
Just returned from our second trip to this hotel, last time we stayed on the Los Corales side, this time on the Carisol side.  Both are similar.  The hotel is in need of repair, especially walkways and lighting (take a flashlight).  Don’t go here if you want a 4 or 5 star hotel, but if you want great weather, friendly staff, ok food and drinks for a cheap price then this place is for you.  Lots of retired people go here for a month.  The pools on either side of the hotel are clean and nice, but the tiles and concrete around the pools could use repair just like the walkways. There is a Kids club building beside the pool that is used for washrooms and towel distribution, however not much activities for the kids.  The beach is beautiful and the water was warm.  Lots of shade and;3
Just got back last Thursday night late. Had another wonderful vacation at Corales. would we go back, heck yes. this was our 5th time there. Staff are great. Marlaidis as usual goes out of her way to help any and all resort guests she is wonderful. Ivan of course is very helpful and Yolani at the pool bar was amazing just wish they wouldn't move everyone around so much but hey we are not running the place so have to respect their way. Dolly in the buffet was very helpful and always had a smile on her face. Fransisco of course is the best bartender not to put the others down but is very joyful.  I have to say this time around Ovidio and his wife ( who isn't suppose to be behind the 24 hr bar) were not very pleasant at all sorry to say. Last time we were there last March it seemed;4
We arrived at the resort in time for lunch, and were told to just leave our bags. Then we saw their offerings, and it was mighty sad. They obviously don’t have (or use) any spices, and overcook pretty well everything. Their chicken could be laced and worn as shoes, but a knife wouldn’t cut it. They put out pork bones, and they were mostly fat and bone, with precious little meat. The room was nice, but we were told the beds were twin, and they were singles. When we looked in the shower stall, we first noticed the shower head was one which is removable but the piece where it should be placed to hang was broken. As well, the soap dish in the shower kept coming off as we were taking or replacing the soap. Last, but certainly not least, the shower curtain was a good three inches;2
Allo...Hello...Hola! This was the best trip ever with my Friend Johanne, my soul sister.  We have met so many lovely , loving , caring people, it unbelieveble! We have found another family at this hotel.  Our hearts are so filled with love, it was hard to leave you all! We had a great service, thank you Martha our Chamber maid, thank you Nilda our towel segnorita, you have a heart of gold, gracias xoxo thank you Charlie at the bar pool, thank you Jo, the kitchen supervisor xoxo. Ted and Laura, you have made this trip so memerable, thank you and love you mom and dadxo We had so much fun dancing and laughing every night at the pool bar with our new friends, Marius, Coleen, Ben, Julie, Maryse and Daniel love u and will miss u, xoxoxo  The show at night could be a little bit better,;4
This place had some good points,snorkeling was great, the beach nice and offered lot's of shade. Not the same white sand as the other side of Cuba, but still great. Our week had many seniors and from what I heard this is normal. So if your under 40 and looking for people to party with I wouldn't recommend unless you have a large group.  The entertainment staff, well they are way better at Club Amigo Caracol in Santa Lucia Cuba. The pools and grounds were nice and the open air dinning room had a nice breeze. IF you have been to this resort Carisol Los  Corales is similar, but 10 of us rather Club Amigo Caracol in Santa Lucia. Over all it was a great time dispite the ice machine breaking down, the food.   If we had paid full price I  would have been disapointed but I  belive we;3
Club Amigo Los Corales could be a lot better if it was managed better. Rather than detail my experience I am providing an overview.  Highlights:  Location - Santiago de Cuba is beautiful and very picturesque. Surrounded by the Sierra Mastre mountains, the setting of Los Corales is picture perfect.  Architecture - the architecture of the resort is quite beautiful and the design of the bungalows is impressive. Our ocean-front room was perfect for us - though there are rooms on the second floor, we did not have one above our room.  Entertainment - the nightly shows, with the exception of the night they attempted some comedy, were surprisingly good.  Snorkeling - the inner basin is quite good for snorkeling once you find your way around.  Staff - the staff is excellent. They do;2
The last time were we’re at The Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales was Jan 2012. In my review then I stated even though it had its issues, I would return if the price was right. Well the price was right and we returned. Getting through the airport was uneventful and I even had time to exchange the cash I would need to cover us for our stay.  I read previous comments about cash not always available at the front desk which was true, so I was glad I did.   The scenic ride from the airport to the hotel takes about an hour. For those who are not aware, Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales is basically two resorts operating as one. They each have their own front desks for check in, money exchange, etc. but you have access to the all the facilities on both sides.  The walk between the two is;4
Let me just say at the outset, this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review about our stays in Cuba. My wife and I have travelled to Cuba (13 times) and other Caribbean Islands (a further 5 times) over the last 20 years. We love Cuba and the Cuban people. Our goal on this trip was to find a place where we could go back to for possibly a longer term stay than the two weeks we have been going for recently. We had been here for one week in Jan. 2011 - before Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012 I believe with devastating effect in this area. We were a bit dubious upon our arrival since we had booked an oceanview bungalow and after a long day and slow booking in process we were shown to a room overlooking the parking lot!! I was not a happy camper and immediately returned;5
Just returned from 2 weeks at Los Corales.......and I can't wait to return. Once again, we had a wonderful vacation.  The food has improved from last year, and it was good then. Always chicken, beef, pork and fish.....something cooking on the grill. The staff are absolutely amazing.......even after working a 16 hour day. They are always smiling and pleasant.  Our rooms were great and our chambermaid, Beatriz, couldn't do enough for us. The reception staff were very nice and Marleidis, in charge of client services, is just amazing. We noticed that they have freshened up the hotel.....new paint, signage, etc. Also, they have put up railings at the pool and in the lobby at the steps.....bravo! I love this resort and all the staff working there. I will certainly be back......soon!;4
Jan 7th-14th  This was my 3rd trip to Los corales and it was just as great as my first 2 trips. The food was actually better this January then when I was there last April.  This time I went with a group of 11 people one including my daughter that is 8 (she had a blast). There is alot of post on here about this resort and prostitution and they are not wrong BUT this is what adults see not children my daughter never even noticed the dirty old men with young cuban women.  My daughter and myself went on the dolphin day thing which she found very fun and enjoyed the price was $65 (if u didn't swim with the dolphins it was $25)  I have went on other day trips on pass trips that were good too like the catamaran (long long day) $65 and the half day history tour (my favorite) $35.  I;5
We just returned from a week at Carisol Los Corales. This was our first trip to Cuba and we went with friends who had been to this resort just last year. The first thing we saw was a stagnant, brackish pool of water that should have been a flowing fountain - not a good first impression. We had a bungalow so it was quiet and looked good from the outside. There were safety issues in the room as well as the grounds. The hair dryer had bare wires that had been taped over to attach a different plug, our room only had one key so the cleaning staff could only clean when we were there (instead of making a new key - the lock was changed), the grounds had broken cement covers (or none at all) over open holes. There were empty flower beds that could have been filled with simple cacti and;2
Visited Club amigo Carisol Los Corales Jan 28-Feb 4. Stayed on the Corales side as I usually do. I have visited this resort several times and I will say that this is by far the best visit yet. Many updates done to the Corales side, paint, signs as well as the food was so good! Night and day on the food from last year.  Room: Stayed in the 500 block like usual and was wonderful. Always hot water, chambermaid was very attentive, cleaned first thing in the morning.  Food: Like I said great, I gained weight. Few tips, if you like hot hot food go right when the buffet opens. Lots of selection and never a shortage of staples like bread and butter.  Bars: No problems with shortages this year. One day there was no pina coladas until afternoon but no worries lots of other selections.;5
Jan 29-Feb 5th 2015 When arriving at the resort it was dark but staff tried their best to accommodate us by giving us beverages...The place is nice and welcoming.  before heading down i read reviews about this place.... most are on point.  here are the things that you should know before heading down...  MAKE SURE YOU SECURE YOUR BELONGINGS LITTLE THINGS WILL DISAPPEAR!!!! it may not matter but things you dont expect will suddenly walk out on their own.  Report it , nothing happens... it kind of ruins one day or even vacation so just beware of that.  sorry to be blunt but we had a lot of stuff went missing and we were told our cleaner was the best and trusted cleaner but we ended up not having someone to clean our room. They do clean your room everyday but just be careful know;3
"We just returned from 14 days at Carisol. This was our second trip to CLC. I belong to a private Facebook group dedicated to this resort and even so, I was unprepared to see the further deterioration of this potentially/formerly lovely little resort.   At the risk of repeating myself and others, the property sustained some significant damage in Hurricane Sandy (Oct 2012.) Having said that, it is clear that some minor, but in my opinion misguided attempts have been made to make improvements. It was clear to me during and after this visit, that what the place needs is not a half-baked new ""ranchon."" What it needs is new plumbing and sanitary systems. It needs electrical systems upgraded. It needs steam tables and proper refrigeration and ICE machines!   It needs a thorough";2
January 7-21 was our second visit to Club Amigo Carisol Los Coarales. We stayed once again in an ocean-view bungalow on the Los Corales side.  The room was adequate, the air conditioner worked, there was lots of hot water, toliet paper, etc. etc. We noticed immediately that the work they were doing last year on cleaning up the beach area has continued and it looks much better. We also noticed that the overall food offerings had also improved since last year. We are not overly fussy and after many visits around Cuba have become accustomed to the food at the resorts. Surprisingly the hot dogs and hamburgers at the snack bar and occasionally in the dining room are much better than we remember. it is also nice that they have added a pizza and pasta bar at the Los Corales side for;4
I stayed solo at Los Corales side , January 14-21, 2015. This was my 21 trip to Cuba, and 1st to this resort.  .  Firstly, I will start with this – I will definitely return to Corales many more times! It was clean, comfortable, relaxing, with pleasant friendly staff around the resort.  Especially,  Ibia-Reservations, & Marleides- Public Relations : I received much help, advice, and great conversation from them both.  The two ladies were always available, friendly, and ready to help or answer every question I had – They are wonderful staff for Corales to have for dealing with the public/ tourists &   I hope to see them next trip!  Please keep in mind if you have a problem with your room, that this is Cuba, and there is no Walmart, Canadian Tire, or Home Depot stores down the road;4
Los Corrales Jan 14, 2015 to Jan 21, 2015.  Room 119 in the Los Corrales building.  I read many reviews prior to heading down to Los Corrales, some of them quite accurate and others way off the mark.  The Hotel: The condition of the hotel left a lot to be desired, not only was it old but it had been through Hurricane Sandy. Despite the condition of the structure the staff did a good job of keeping things neat and clean. A major flaw in design is the clay and ceramic tile walkways. During and after rain everything became extremely slippery and hazardous. There were a few people from my flight by the end of the week with bandages on their ankles’ and one person confined to a wheelchair. I pulled my back slipping on the second night there. Given the beads it only got worse through;2
I've been to Los Corales a few times before, but hadn't returned in 3 years. I was there January 7 - 14, 2015, and I'm hooked again! This hotel is not fancy by any means, but everything is clean and adequate. Keep your expectations reasonable, and you'll have a blast!  The staff were so welcoming and attentive, it felt as if I'd never left. They are awesome! The beach was great for relaxing in the sun, and the pool was fun as well. Gotta love a swim up bar! I strongly recommend also taking in the catamaran tour with William, as well as the bus into the city of Santiago de Cuba. Educational, interesting, and so much fun!!!  I will be returning next winter for sure, maybe earlier.;4
I was booked for Costa Morena as a single from January 14-21 but got a call from Sunwing at 5 pm the night before leaving. They said that the hotel was over booked and offered a refund or to move me (and a few others) to the Hotel Carisol down the Carretera de Baconao. I knew this was an upgrade so I agreed to the change. As it turned out, I  am happy that I did as I heard people were getting sick at Costa Morena. There was hot water 7/24, a toilet that worked fine and finally a room that did not have noisy neighbors or had a television on all night. Generally speaking the Carisol was much better than Costa Morena.  Carisol is supposedly the weaker sister of the two hotels at that location. Rumor was that food at the other hotel, Los Corales, was poor and that they ran out of;3
We just came back from another wonderful trip from Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales in Santiago de Cuba.  As our previous reviews indicated we stayed on the Los Corales side of the resort, but this time we stayed on the Carisol side.  We stayed in room #501.  Room was perfect, our chambermaid always kept it clean and tidy, decorating our beds with towel sculptures every day. Nice.  The food - oh, where do I start.  The food was amazing this time around (unlike previous visits where we felt like we were starving).  Morning breakfasts were filled with french toast with syrup, pancakes, fruit juices, fresh bread and eggs and omelets.  Wonderful.  Lunch time we had freshly made pizza and spaghetti.  Dinner time was great.  We had turkey one night, delicious roast beef and chicken;4
"The best part about our vacation here was the weather. 30 degrees C + (92F) everyday add to that nothing but sun - how can you beat that?  We left the extreme cold weather & snow behind and lived in the tropics for a glorious week.  Plenty of sun, fun, scuba diving and a little rum thrown in.   The airport is just mayhem, crazy and unorganized; people and suitcases everywhere.  Welcome to a small airport in Cuba. Hope you packed your patience. Eventually you will make it to the resort.  Make sure you get on the right bus. Travel time is about an hour.  Take a nap or enjoy the countryside.  Grab a beer for the ride!   There are a number of things that, if you can not cope with or move past, then I do not recommend this resort.  It is a 3 star Cuban resort, not a luxury resort.";4
"WHY WE WENT? I chose this city because my parents were with us this time and they're seniors who prefer museums and historical landmarks and such. My sibs & I went to Varadero in 2012 but that's the ""american side"" Santiago is 90 km on sea from Jamaica so beach perfection - so we were now on the ""carribean side"". I took very detailed notes spoiler-alert***  GO (ALLEZ) ONDELAY into the CITY!  Santiago City was even BETTER than Varadero City. It's full of young peoples going to school (free there by the way inc universidad :) the boomers who work not so great jobs but are so happy it's contagious and the seniors who love the city and will share their joy with you! I barely spent any time at the resort unless it was night-time b/c let's face it - we didn't travel for the resort -";4
At the start of the trip two plane loads came at the same time - could have been planned better by the airline. Same on the way back. The weather was excellent we went over Christmas. The hotel was regular Cuban fare with a lot of wild animals roaming the grounds, their droppings are not cleaned up so watch where you walk. The room was okay, we liked our location next to the pool bar and close to the beach. The buffet was good for breakfast and the pizza for lunch as well as pasta was okay, the dinner was not good and we both lost weight! The service at the beach was excellent(Frank at the bar, the guy who carried the chairs (Ernesto?) and the hamburger man. The beach was nicely treed and we always found shade as it was very hot. They are rebuilding from the hurricane and put;3
We had such an awesome time celebrating our little one's 1st birthday here and will be returning to the resort once again for birthday #2 this April. The staff went out of their way to get her a cake and a mariachi band to sing for her ... thank you Barbara and Marileds..it was super cool and created the best memories for our family. For the price you pay...trying going anywhere in Canada for the same $$amount all-inclusive and sun/beach front..oh and not forgetting the unlimited booze...best cuba libres ever!!! Marisol was amazing in attending to us...we never over tipped just smiles and treat them like they are your equal and not your servants...goes along way!!! The buffet was okay but I took my own Club House spices and my Diana's bbq sauce and it was pretty good. My only;4
"I went to this resort in April of 14' for a birthday vacation. it was my first time out of the country and I was obviously excited. the arrival to the resort wasnt anything special and when we got there we were welcomed with rum punch while we waited to check in. the rooms were nice but some of them had a connecting door in the middle of them that went to the room next to them. only problem with that is when you're roomed next to strangers who are constantly having ""fun"". the food was pretty bad, not going to lie. the buffet was bland and the food had flies all over it! the pizza and pasta sides of the dining room were always busy and it was one person making food for at least 40 guests. it took forever to get your food and when you did it was often burned. dogs and cats would";3
The most important things (warm sea, weather, cleanness and friendly staff) are very good. Carisol hotel looks more worn out then Coralles but the food and activities are the same. Bring your water shoes - the plage is not the best, many rocks and corals.  As far as restaurants - do not expect gourmet food. We were surprised, there were no good fruits and vegetables. Tomatoes, cucumbers, papaya, watermelon are tasteless and flavorless.   There are 2 ticket restaurants there. Meat menu in Coralles (pork only) and fish menu in Carisol (basa only).  There is not much to see in the neighborhood. If you like active leisure, there is dolphinarium where you can swim with dolphins, very cheap, and horseback ride. We have bargained with the Cubans - 20 peso for 1.5 hour tour per family;3
Los Corales This coming year will be our 6th year returning to this hotel. We have travelled to 5 other hotels all around Cuba, and although they were nice this is the only hotel we've repeated.  The weather is always perfect!!!! My husband and I are always treated like returning family. Last year our 3 beautiful daughters traveled there for a week themselves! If that doesn't tell you it is a safe place I don't know what will!!! The rooms are always clean and are kept that way for your entire stay. If you need anything just ask, manners and a friendly smile go a long way here!   The pools are always well kept and cleaned daily. If you are an early riser you will see all the workers busy preparing for the guests day. The servers at restaurants and bars alike for the most part are;4
Going now the 10. time to Los Corales and we are by far not the couple who has been there most often. I like the peace fullness of this hotel and the friendliness of the staff. Also they have very nice rooms and the food is good for this kind of hotel. Since this hotel is out in the country there  is no problem with safety [ so far ], one can go for a walk alone up the hills and visit the local people without any problems. The beach is nothing special, but the ocean is warm and good for snorkeling and diving. There is a problem solver to serve the tourists, it's Marleidis, a friend of every tourist. Go there and experience it, you may like it. Harry;3
since im 53 traveling alone with my 4years old dauther nothing is simple but my stay at the carisol-los corales is a good experience instead of babysitting,i can say that im taking vacation. the kindness of the staff ,always overlooking to make sure that everything is perfect made they hotel my destination for the last 4 years. even with the last hurycane i can say that i never saw the cuban back down and you can feel and see that they are whorking hard. each time i go i see some improvement  the beach is now perfect and with the coral reef  protecting the shore its ideal for snorkling. the diving experience is getting back its color and now the fish are back.if you like sea food pork or chicken then your ok with the buffet plus they italian restorante . and for the night show;5
My family is going to this hotel since last few years for Christmas. We always find there friendly atmosphere. People are very welcoming and nice. Rooms are clean,and balconies has good size and nice chairs to sit on. Staff is very helpful with anything you need. I'll recommend Carisol Los Corales to everyone how wants to go for nice family vacation.;5
This is the third time we have been to this resort although every other time we have been on the Corales side.  We were housed in building 5 on the second floor.    Our room was clean and large.  The balcony over looked  the kids club and the pool.  The airconditioner was loud but did the job.  There was a disco each night but we never heard it over the hum....suited us just fine!  The beach was beautiful...one of the main reasons we go here.  It was not crowded at all and Ernesto made sure we always had a clean chair....there were 15 of us so that was a lot of chairs to carry. Guillermo the security guard came over to talk to us the first day...he was quite helpful with information about the area and attractions as well as making us feel everything was safe on the beach.   One;4
"Another trip to the hotel. This time a week in December.  The trip; I went with Sunwing with priority check in Toronto. One way priority well worth it; less waiting in the line and some additional luggage, I think 10 kg for $40. The trip was good, no excitements.  Airport in Santiago; not a big airport and it looks like some people start to recognize me. I think it is good. Buses were ready waiting. It could be a good idea to exchange some money there and it is always good idea to get some beers for the trip to hotel. Beer is 1 CUC. The landscaping on the way is amazing.  The hotel; I was on Corales side. Very quick and professional check in. All was ready, the drinks (most important) music and the key and help to get your things to the room. I always take a packed bicycle, so";5
My family has been going to Los Corales for many years. I love going to this hotel, it feels like a second home. The staff provides some of the friendliest and most attentive service I've ever received. Beautiful and isolated setting, healthy food choices, quiet and clean. Amazing value. I can't wait to return next year.;5
Second time at this hotel. Seems a little better every year. We stayed from Nov.26 to Dec.3, 2014 and me and my wife had a great time. Not too many tourists this time of year, it is still considered off season and the other hotel Los Corales was closed, but almost ready to open by the time we left. We didn't see it as an inconvenience, we like it a little bit more quiet.  The staff was friendly and courteous, and trying their best to make you feel welcomed. Starting with Ernesto who's hard work over the day made our swim in the ocean more enjoyable, Ovidio at the beach bar who was always ready to serve you, Juan Torres, our maid Lidia, Alejandro at the reception, Maria Rosa and so many other people behind the scene who are trying their best. Yes, there is always room for;5
"We loved : the beautiful, well maintained beach and the snorkeling and Ernesto's helpful service with lounges and warning us about the lion fish and sea urchins (priceless!); we did not like: the weeds in the shallow water near shore which made it so difficult to see the sea urchins. We loved: the excellent buffet food, the best we have ever had at a 3 star resort in Cuba, and there was plenty of it; We hated: the hordes of flies which attacked the food as soon as it was uncovered at every meal, as well as the food on our plates. We loved: the beautiful big swimming pool; we hated: the prostitutes who lounged around it with the single tourists; We loved: the friendly wait staff (especially Suerami in the buffet); Osmaris the pizza cook ; the fruit servers, omelet cooks; we loved";2
"We`ve spent a week in November 2014 in Carisol. The hotel is still getting back on his feet from Sandy. Some say, it`s been two years since then but you know ""Cuba time"" everything takes longer to repair. The beach is a bit rocky but there is a nice coral barrier not far from it. Great snorkeling. The hotel isnt so bad ; good Cuban food (no it ain't the same as home). Our room was nice but the AC was a bit noisy (I called it the plane engine all week) but it covered all the other noise that are in the background after dark (shows and all). As for the excursions ; we visited a lot of stuff but off the chart (with a taxi/horse) and it was probably better than if we took a tour with the bus. Great view with the mountains, forest and sea. I`ll definitely go back to finish my";3
Firstly the bus ride was terrible. One of my kids was sick from the plane, and on the 1.5 hour bus ride the bus driver drove like a mad man. He almost got in 2 accidents and it was so bumpy and fast, it made us all feel sick, and was very hard on my child.  We got to the resort, and the staff greeted us with orange juice while we waited to be checked in, which was a nice touch. We were so excited to be at the beach, that once we checked in, we dropped all our bags into the room and then ran to the beach. One of my kids ran into the water, and we were never told that there is a massive sea urchin problem, literally thousands upon thousands. Within 3 seconds of running into the ocean, he stepped onto a sea urchin. We then had to spend the next two hours with a nurse pulling out;2
Hotel Club Amigo Carisol.  A disappointment. I visited Cuba 3 years in a row and have to say that my choice this year has been a let down.    First the positive.  Accommodation in a 2 stories attractive building (500 block) decorated with large river stones imbedded in its walls was very good. We were on the second floor and the high 16 ft ceiling  gave the room an airy feel.  We did spend some time in the room during the hottest parts of the day, so that was important. Hotel Carisol is still being updated and our building was freshly painted. Some bungalows  near the ocean were boarded up or in process being renovated.   The large bedroom,  fridge, bathroom and balcony was more than satisfactory. I would design the building so, that the balcony face the ocean view, but they;2
"It was just ok! The bus ride to the resort was long but really cool to see the area. Check in took forever, very unorganized. Rooms are decent, cleaning ladies are great so friendly! Pools were beautiful, beach was ok. Food was (as expected) not good. There were a few things daily that were decent.. like bread lol. It also took forever to get a glass of water! Waitresses were a little rude about as well. The ""disco"" was a little tent on the beach. Meh. Lots of older people, not many people our age (we're 24 and 28). Overall I wouldn't go back, I'd like to try something new.";3
Let me tell you the plain truth. This place will be disappointing for sure. I'm not one of those people who went to cuba for the first time and set the bar too high or had an assumption Cuban hotels would be somewhat like home. I've been to cuba quite a few times and this place is out of excuses.   First of all I've now learned I'm more of a isolated area kind of guy. I've also learned that in cuba three stars is not enough. I don't need a huge beach, I don't need 5 or more pools, burin do need upkeep, maintained, clean and cared for on vacation. This doesn't meet one of those. I thought I walked into an abandoned hotel. First the room was awful. We had conjoined motel rooms. First the mirrors on the closets were shattered with glass on the floor. The shower heads were broken in;2
Went here last year and still cannot get over how bad this place is. Check in was a nightmare so was the room and especially the food and cheap booze ,it was worse than I thought it could be ,been to Varadero it was ok at best but this place is the absolute worst .People complain about the bus ride from airport to pig pen but I found this to be the highlite of our trip.Do not get the pizza ,we watched the black Cuban guy making it ,perspiration running down and off his arms ,off his neck face ,man it was bad and then take out a rag from his pocket and wipe his arms face neck & stick rag back in pocket and repeat this a few times with no water to wash his hand.UNBELEIVABLE and sickening.But if you enjoy this type of behaviour to save a few bucks ,go for it.;1
This resort is great, they offer many activities such as spanish lessons dance lessons pool activities all water things to do just not motorized.i enjoyed the catamaran ($60) tour which is pretty much the whole day u can drink on the boat they stop for snorkeling and take u into Santiago de cuba u have lunch at the dock, the guide shows u around u can do a little shopping and then get on a bus back to the resort. The night entertainment is ok the comedy and the pool show was the best. The food was yummy but I would go to the A La Carte instead of the buffet just because it feels like more of a sit down dinner u can get pork beef chicken or seafood all inclusive u must book the morning of at the front desk of the hotel by 10 am I was never up early enough to do it but was at the;5
Went to this hotel with my family and 2 other families. Great food, snorkeling, staff were friendly and helpful. Hire one of the 1950's taxis to take you into San Diego, interesting town and very safe. Hotel room was a bit run down and hotel grounds are a bit unkempt but all in all a great holiday.;3
Okaaay... So I went with my friend to carisol Los corales (we're both 20) and I would say... DONT GO THERE ALONE. Only with a group of People and only then you'll have FUN!!  The resort is split in 2 hotels: we stayed at carisol.- The boring one!!! If u get into carisol ask to switch into Los corales because there is all the fun. Walking distance tho. Maybe 3 min, walking to get to the other hotel. Food: was okay. Recommend to reserve in the other restaurant for dinner. Pool. Was nice. Pool bar at carisol u have to wait maybe 2 mins to get a drink. (That bar is popular) Entertainment. Was good but ONLY AT LOS CORALES-go there every night for a pre drink before u get to te disco! Disco.. Here comes the fun.. Lol  very small. On the beach. Looks like a Big big tent form far away.;3
"We've been to Cuba several times at ""affordable"" resorts and have always been pleasantly suprised...not so much this time.  Resort is a tad boring.  I can take mediocre food, mediocre accomodations, mediocre beach but I can't take medoicre activities/entertainment/nightlife.  Luckily, we travelled with 2 more couples and managed to squeek out some fun but had we gone there by ourselves, it would have been uber-boring.... We will not be back to this resort";2
Although this resort  is not the five star everyone searches for, you can't ask for better service..the staff are amazing & make very little money..they bend over backwards to make your stay better...its very reasonable to stay here & they have to separate areas to stay at both on same property but a walk away through a path from each other. the beauty here lies at the beach..it is breath taking. Scuba diving is amazing here as well. The food is average over all depending on the time of year you go. When hurricane Sandy ripped through this resort area it did a lot of damage..so keep that in mind if your planning on going here...;3
I love this resort  my most recent visit was may 5th- May 26th or at least that's what I originally booked about half way through the trip the resort actually closed but my time there 2 as very enjoyable there were very few people there becuase the resort was closing but the staff were amazing finding us suitable places to stay. The foods ... well its food lol. Entertainment was still good I enjoyed my stay there. Definitely a family place if you have kids especially when the other resort is open becuase there more entertainers abs entertaining dome we between both resorts. The resort is beautiful !! Definitely my favorite place in cuba :);5
The resort wasn't horrible, especially for a cheap price ($540.00/person). My boyfriend and I went, we're 29 and 30 and met some great people while we were there. An honestly, you get what you put into the trip. So if you think it's sucks and continue to pout about it you're going to have a s***ty week! The food was alright, it's Cuba. The hotel doesn't except visa for your trips so make sure you bring cash, they can exchange Canadian cash at the resort. The pool was nice, however, it wasn't cleaned so when we arrived it was bright blue and by the end of the week it was very green! (like the water at the front of the resort). A lot of people had ear infections towards the end of the week. The rooms did have an odor, cover the hole in the floor in the bathroom with a towel if you;3
Cuba is a unique destination, when you arrive at the airport you adjust your time, they are behind 1 hour and 50 years! I see a lot of Cuban flags around, I though at first that they are very patriotic, but after a few days you realize that it is for the tourist, to remind you that you are in the third world country and not to expect things to work as you would expect them in the first world countries. The convertible peso is greater than Canadian or US dollar, again, take that as a joke and go along with it.  Loved the ocean, the older grandchildren, ages 6 to 14 years old, swims from the shore to the edge of the coral tidal break and it is safe, the water is calm and warm. The amount of species from that small spot is amazing, it kept my grandchildren busy every time we are at;5
Family of 11 went cost per person was $658. Travelled April 27-May 5 Room was good, maid service good. The food was horrible...many fruit flies, cleanliness in restaurant not the greatest. I didnt starve but have stayed at other resorts in Cuba @3.5 and had way better experience with food. The customer service needs lots to be desired. Staff served before us could wait up to 15 minutes for service but they are looking for a tip.  Staff working at night slerping in lobby when went to lobby bar. 24 hour bar by pool closed due to septic back up.  Pool liner needs replacing feeling bubble in it...but an ok pool.

Excellent resort!! Very nice staff, feels like home here.  Very beautiful. Even after the big storm that hit them this place is in excellent condition and everyone's super cool going back again in may . Love love love it!;5
Spent a week with the lovely people at CACLC. It is important to remember that they were devestated by the Hurricane 3 years ago and do not have the means to make it beautiul in a hurry. The beach is not we are used to but with a pair of watershoes not a problem. The sea was quite warm while we were there.  The rooms are in need of updating but were kept impecibly clean. There was always someone with a broom or mop outdoors as well. The staff works very hard to keep the resort clean. The ood was surpringly good, you dont go to a 3* expecting gourmet meals. I am glutten intolerant and had NO issues finding something good to eat each meal. We sat in Maritza's section, I don't know I could say enough about our singing waitress, she greeted us with a smile and a song each meal. We;3
"Our second trip to Carisol Los Corales - and loved it.  Remember folks - it's only a 3 start resort.  Yes, it needs some renovations and upgrades, but if you know Cuba, you know how difficult it is for that to happen.  We had absolutely no complaints about the food - you make it work for you.  Our only complaint is the lack of sufficient beach (and pool) chairs.  Many people go to the beach very early in the morning and ""reserve"" chairs for crowds of their friends.  Short of  policing the chairs, the only resolution is to get more chairs - lots more!!!  Take a chance - you can't go wrong.  The staff is wonderful!!!  I";4
After an extremely harsh winter, my girlfriend and I decided to get the heck out of Canada as soon as possible to seek the warm embrace of the Caribbean sun. We carefully researched dozens of resorts in multiple countries, and settled upon Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales in Cuba.  This turned out to be an excellent choice for every reason imaginable. The staff were very accommodating and friendly, the weather was unbelievably perfect, the resort property itself is  situated in an idyllic location, with towering mountains and lush tropical foliage surrounding it's  amazing beachfront. The bars were always open (sweet!), food was plentiful and constantly available, and if by some chance you got bored of the beach, there was no shortage of activities, from cultural learning;4
Came for the week of Jan 19th with my daughter and 12 friends.. Our rooms were clean and staff made our beds daily and cleaned our rooms. The food was okay and we never went hungry( its cuba food) The bartenders and the entertainment we loved, the pool was great and we will all be back next Jan for sure we had a great time and we treated very well!!!!;4
We had a wonderful time at this resort. As usual, the Cuban people are wonderful. The location is very far from the airport and almost a whole day is wasted travelling. The food was the usual and the staff was exceptional. Having travelled before, I find the saving of the sun chairs by placing towels the night before is totally unacceptable. One couple saved their chairs the whole week. We stayed at Corales, (I think it was 2 years ago in February), and the Carisol side was also opened. We stayed pretty close to our hotel and the beach.;4
"Had great time again.  I was there from April 6th to 21st for 2 weeks. This was my 5th time at this resort. The weather was just amazing, a bit more mosquitos at this time of the season.  This was end of the season for them. They are closing at the end of April for international guests and run during May for Cubans. They are opening againg in November. The resort was unusually busy, they had to open some parts of sister hotel Carrisol, hence some folks had a bit longer way to restaurant, pool, and other attractions. We could blame looong Canadian winter for that :)  I was nicely surprised by improvements in accomodation level and food quality. Service was excellent, no complaints here.  I had room 506; good AC, good bed, updated fixtures in the bathroom, and no complaints";5
If you are given accommodation in the open part of the resort I would guess everything would be satisfactory, However, beware if you check in and are told that it will be a km  walk to your room, because you have been allocated a room in the mainly closed part of the hotel, which seems to act as an emergency overflow. There are no facilities close by, apart from the beach and a beach bar. The shop supplying bottled water and principle bars and restaurants are in the new part of the grounds. The food was good but I prefer not to share a restaurant with local dogs looking for food and birds who were frequent visitors to the sweet cakes! The majority of the staff, especially those covering room cleaning were great but the staff on the desk were far from satisfactory and lacking in;3
I've just returned from a one week vacation at Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales. This is actually a two hotel resort, Carisol and Los Corales. I stayed at Los Corales, the Carisol part of the resort is closed as there were not enough guests for it to be opened. One of the staff told me that they open from September until May only.  The resort is located between the Sierra Maestra mountains and the ocean, in a small village, 40 KM away from Santiago de Cuba City.  The beach was nice, with many trees for shade. I would suggest to bring a hammock as there are many trees that you could use for hanging it just on the beach. Also, bring your snorkeling kit and water shoes as there are many rocks and water plants and therefore many fish swimming around the area. The water is very calm.;4
I stayed here for two weeks in 2011, one week on one side and one week on the other. Both sides have great pools and pool bars. The lack of snack bar had me hungry more than a few times as if you miss a meal time there isn't much that can be done. The entertainment staff were very nice and the bartenders were on the ball, even remembered my favourite drinks and poorer them when they saw me walking over. Food was decent, nothing special but not bad at all. Wear shoes to most parts of the beach because there are a lot of burrs and nettles. The ocean was filled with sea urchins so be careful of those too. A beach cleanup would benefit this resort a lot. Rooms were clean, everything worked. While we were there a few people's rooms were broken into (clothes, laptops and other devices;3
"We travelled here in April, 2014.  We were ""upgraded"" to a bungalow, without asking.  The hotel is in great need of repair.  The pool liner is coming up, the walkways are chipped and uneven, our safe and fridge didn't work. The grounds need some serious work. The beach was rocky, but it didn't matter as I'm a pool girl. The food wasn't bad for Cuba.  Drinks were ok, ran out of ice alot. A few of the staff were rude, but the pool bartenders and our maid were excellent.  The beds were comfortable, but pillows hard as a rock. We met some wonderful people, who have returned to this resort year after year as the price is right.";3
Second visit there last year service was awesome felt welcomed. This visit not so much seemed like if you didn't tip you didn't get service. You had to ask for everything nothing was ever offered aka water at meals, after glass sat empty you had to ask even after they looked rite at it! I get it some of you are thinking a newb to Cuba not really that was trip 8 and 4th to Santiago area! This is a great resort just very disappointed especially when were a group and celebrating our wedding anniversary.  On that note my hat is off to Julio, Rahul, Ovittio, and Elizabeth.  Without them the resort would sink they make it worth the visit!!! They would be the only reason to go back!!!!  On the last note take your own towel they offer a beach towel but if it goes missing on the weekend;2
Arrived home with a nasty ear infection over 20 people at the resort got it and last day closed the pool . They sent us to the overflow hotel that was all closed so with much complaining we were moved to the side that things were open. Some of the people were friendly some we're not like the lady at the coffee bar was just nasty. Great snorkelling found a lot of shells and all kinds of fish over all not bad for the price! Weekends got really busy with Cuban people and they seemed to get served first we made the best of it and would not go back unless I could get it for like 400 all in . Food not terrible for Cuba;3
Think of a Motel 6 with a Denny's Restaurant and you won't be disappointed.  This is a 3 star and people need to remember that when considering going here.  We had a GREAT time.  We knew it was a 3 star and went with that in mind and had a fantastic time.  Massages are only $15 for half hour!  Try getting that in Canada or U.S., even from a massage school clinic :-)  The food was indeed repetitive, but still lots of choices, even for gluten intolerant folks like us.  Advice that I was happy to have read was bring WATER SHOES.   The beach is rocky with a few nice sandy spots.  Also I almost stepped on some kind of spiky sea urchin and hate to think what would have happened without those had I stepped on the critter.  Most people know this but for those who don't bring insulated;3
I travelled to Los Corales from April 2-9 , 2014. When I first arrived there, they brought myself and my family to the farthest room on the first floor (312), when we specifically asked for a room on the second floor. The room was not appealing at all. My room was missing a telephone, 1 out of the 3 light bulbs were working, there was only one outlet working which was located in the bathroom. We  had no mirrors in the bedroom, only in the bathroom. the air conditioning was very loud and distrubing. The beach party held every night from 12-2 was very loud and you could not fall asleep. There was no toilet paper in the bathrooom at the restaurant. Although there wastilet paper  in the room but it was very thin. You would need several sheets to feel clean after you went to the;3
We returned home last week from Los Corales, we had such a wonderful time!! The stories that someone had circulated about the resort and people who work there are entirely untrue. It's shameful that some tourists tell these lies to cover up their bad behavior.  We have been there many times and this was the best. The food was so much better this time and the staff would do anything for you. They are trying very hard to upgrade this resort. We feel we got more than our moneys worth and will be back next year.  We were there in March. A. J. Beeney;3
This was my first time at this resort and this part of Cuba.  I stayed there from April 2-9th.  I had a good time.  Snorkeling was great, room was clean, food was plain but plentiful.  I agree it is good value for the money. FTR I spent my time at the beach (which I thought was nice) but did hear from others that the pool scene was kind of rough.  I will not go into details since many have here and will instead give tips to help plan your stay.  Tips: 1. ***Bring your own plastic tumbler cup and mug*** - trust me, bring this, if you do not you will regret it and will stare longingly at everyone else who knew to bring one.    2.  Everything is cash only even at the hotel including excursions so make sure you bring enough and do not count on credit.  The hotel will change cash but;3
Room, towels and a/c unit full of mould. Never really cleaned up from Sandy. Service is good if you constantly pump peso's at the staff. Road to and from resort is a goat path. Still,some staff are great, like the lady who makes the omelettes and the wait staff in the dining area. Food was actually better here than at other resorts I've been to. All in all I wouldn't return to this resort. There are far better resorts elsewhere in the fabulous isle of Cuba.;3
We travelled March 26 - April 2nd and stayed at Los Corales.  We travelled with kids and grandchildren this time.  This was our 4th time at this resort and again, we were not disappointed.  This is quiet resort away from everthing.  Perfect for unwinding.  The weather is always good.  The resort is clean, the staff friendly and the food the best we have experienced (between our son and ourselves, we have been at 4 other resorts) though Cuban.  Don't go to Cuba for the food. The staff is friendly and hard working. We were warned about exchanging money before we got to the resort because they apparently had some problems so I exchanged some at the airport.  We didn't have issues getting more at the resort. The Sunwing staff was good, the excursions still good. This is great value;3
We went to this resort from March 30 to april 6th 2014,I wasnt sure what to expect from the negative reviews on here.Let me tell you for a 3 star it was well worth the money.There was no spiders,cock roaches or ants ever.The food was ok its cuban food,take salt and pepper and ketchup.If all fails you cant screw up eggs or fresh baked bread or fresh fruit.Awesome!!!desserts awesome!!!Rooms very clean all staff so very friendly.Raul you rock!!Sure there was issues with some rooms with showers not working but there was always hot water bend over if you have to and wash your hair scrub up and get out and enjoy what they have to offer no complaints other than check in is slow.The beach you do not need sand shoes and always chairs and shade galore.they never ran out of booze like some;4
this resort was far more than I was expecting! friendly faces everywhere! I would love to go back! the beach was quiet and peacful and relaxing. iTS ALL WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT! food was good, I drank strawberry daquiries, rum punch, crystal beer, mojitos, all tasted good! white sand clear water. always a beach chair available. the day excursians were affordable. yes stray dogs, stray cats, stray cow one night that I saw, a donkey, so what! they werent hurting anyone. and everybody must know by now bring your own cup to a resort.   yes there are prositutes there but I child would never know the difference. its not like they loiter around and wait Inside the resort. just egnore them!   make a note of what to bring! condoments from home even if it means stock piling from mcd's, penut;5
The weather was amazing!!that alone sold us! For the money we loved it for what it was!  We Met some interesting people...only complaints would be food that's cuba! But always something the beds are uncomfortable! Wear water shoes take your snorkelling gear! Explore around the resort! It's a good place be open minded!;4
Food-lousy! What you didn't eat at lunch was back out at supper. Drinks-Awful! Rum tastes like turpentine! Room cleaner stole my wife's jacket & then stood there with her hand out for a tip! Sunwing rep lied to us repeatedly. And after sorting out the BS we find out that the nearest bank with money in it is in Holguin( half way across the island!)  Spend a little more and go somewhere else!;1
I don't even know where to start ... The only good things to say about my whole trip was that the weather was amazing and Fernando the bar tender at the 24 hour bar was great.    Now onto the rest of it.  Make sure you bring your own travel mug if staying here, the 2nd day we were there they ran out of cups, and the day after that we saw the cleaning staff going around picking up cups, rinsing them, and bringing them to the bar to be reused ... Disgusting.  The only decent meal was the pig roast on Saturday night, there is a restaurant right behind the resort that is amazing tho, and if you give them 24 hours notice they will get you a great lobster dinner.  There are people begging for your belongings (that is staff as well) at all times.  We were in the 500 building and had a;2
We went from March 16th - March 23rd.We had a great vacation with wonderful weather all week. For everyone that is complaining please remember what you paid for your trip.   I have been to Cuba 5+ times (normally Varadero) and we got exactly what we paid for.  Rooms - We were in room 211 and it was exactly what we asked for. We had sent an email for a pool front room and it was only 5 steps to the pool. We had a brand new air conditioner, a fairly newly renovated room and a balcony that had a great view of ocean. We had no bugs in our room  and if the towels or bed sheets were left on the floor they were replaced. We had a few friends that stayed in the 500's and they were pretty shabby rooms from what I hear   Staff - the staff were wonderful and helpful with anything that we;3
Overall we had a great time! We stayed on the Los Corales side. I'd probably choose Varadero though for my next trip back for the beach.  Food: In general the buffet wasn't great but you could always count on good omelettes for breakfast, fresh pizza, tasty rice and black beans, seasonal fruit, and amazing bread. There are very limited seats available for the a la carte and it really wasn't that much better than the buffet. Don't have high expectations. My friend & I got sick drinking our tap water so I suggest buying the bottled water in the shop (1.50 pesos for 1.5L). The best meal was the beach fiesta on the last day with a roasted pig and great fish. (The fish at the buffet was usually overdone bone fish - not tasty and a lot of work to eat).  Pool: Great! Not many;3
My family stayed in  Los Corales for one week during March break. Totally, this hotel exceeded my expectation. The staff was friendly. Our maid made beautiful decorations on the beds each day. Our room is quiet and clean. We liked sitting in the armchairs  on the balcony, enjoying the evening beach. Although the food varieties were limited, the supplies were steady. For each meal, there were bread, rice, vegetable, meat and fruits. I liked their papaya and guava most. (I guessed they were organic.) The beach was rocky, but the water was clear and its temperature was just right. I enjoyed snorkelling in the ocean, watching colourful fishes swimming around. It was a wonderful experience. We will definitely come back.;5
"So let me start but saying prior to traveling to Cuba I reviewed and reviewed postings about Los Corales II was concern on what type of place I was going to be at but for the price I was still going. Well I had a great amazing and wonderful time from the minute I stepped off the bus to the last minute as I climbed the ladder to the airplane to fly home. So I will list the Pro and Cons(and there is not many)  Pro Price- as a single traveller it was a great deal Staff- where do I start, well lets start with my morning coffee @ the Lobby Bar her name is Yolanda(hope I am spelling it correctly) every morning she was smiling and singing, always happy to talk and ask about Canada, even when come resort guess would ""DEMAND"" service and were very rude to her or the other ladies working.";4
I had my mind set that the hotel room was gonna be awful and the food was going to be bland because they rated it a 3 star. My sister and I took the kids for March break and packed an extra suitcase each of stuff to make the room and our stay more comfortable (and stuff to give away). The dollar store was our friend before we left!!! We brought plastic shower mats, scented candles, pillow cases, bug spray for the room, beach mats, water rings, pool noodles, pepper, ketchup, BBQ sauce, mustard, honey mustard, peppermint tea, honey,  snacks....pringle chips, cookies, candies!  When we pulled in I was upset because most of the reviews I read said to try to stay at the Los Corals side...they had us 6 in the Carisol side. Whatever, I just rolled with it!  We told the pleasant lady at;4
The Bartender Obiddo At The Pool Bar Is Amazing And It Has The Best Service There If Your Headed To Any Other Bar It Is Not Worth The Wait The Food Is Extremely Nasty Don't Eat Any Meats With Beef Ear And Claw It's Nasty Excellent Resort For Family's  No Wifi Or Internet Access Though It's A Great Spot To Get Away And Don't Do Excursions With The Hotel Go Outside To The Horse Caddle Or Horses For A Good Price;5
We stayed at the Carisol side which is supposed to be closing soon anyway apparently. There were less people there but also less of everything else haha.   The good:  The resorts is right on the beach, the water is amazing and filled with fishes. There is lots of broken coral though, but if you bring water shoes it should be fine. We spent 50% of our time snorkeling. If you are into that, bring your own gear. The weather was perfect too!  The pool and pool bar are nice. The barmen are lovely and made us delicious drinks.   Our rooms was our favorite part of the resort. 523 on the far side so we could see the ocean from the front door. The cleaning ladies were amazing, hard working and friendly!!! We left a decent tip on the first day and our room sparkled for the rest of the;2
For a 3 star it was just fine, clean room food not bad but the one pool could be fixed.. and they kept running out of the liquior we were drinking.  I didn't like that they let Cuban's in for day visits, as all they did was beg for my rings or cloths, and offer s-x for money... even the ones with kids with them. Beach was bad , but they look like they are trying to clean it up. I feel we got what we paid for...  I would go back.  Mountains were beautiful, staff was friendly...;3
lost wife's luggage mix up with rooms asked  for adjoining- suites big problemo ,anyways it was cursed from the get go ....waitress at restaurant called us loco .... 1st day .the bistros close the pool bar at 5 pm  then the close all bars at 9 and then ur rationed in the   booze. dept. Been to many places 24 hour  bar service this place sucks  staff crabby and rude spend bit more go elsewhere. food sucks service 2 on 10 beware of ping pong table son broke toe;3
"February 19, 2014 to February 26, 2014: We traveled in a small group 1 couple and 2 singles; we stayed in bungalow C, rooms 1, 2 and 3 on the Los Corales side of the resort. This hotel is very much a 3 star resort, but some of the staff and the weather make up for it.  The food was ok, usual Cuban resort food. Not much variety but always very good.  None of us got sick! Our room was clean and had somewhat of an ocean view. The beds were ok, mine was a little bit hard and had springs poking out of it by the end of the week but that didn’t stop me from getting a good night’s sleep. Had a problem with a leaky ceiling near the end of our trip (our upstairs neighbours had a problem with their toilet) but it was fixed the same day. Our cleaning lady was great very sweet and efficient.";3
Where to start... Rooms: bring a pillow and egg crate mattress. Beds are basic hard mattresses but beats sleeping on the floor. Air conditioner worked well but sounded like the plane that brought you to this hole! The chambermaid did make the bed daily with cute towel animals but did nothing more than that...removing empty glasses were apparently not part of the training...we left them there all week to see if they were ever picked up. Nope! Food: anyone knows you don't go to cuba for the food so it's pretty much as expected, though I did eat bad cheese on the last day and ended up puking it up on the bus ride to the airport. The other thing to be aware of is WHAT you are eating...I ended up being served what I was told was beef only to find out that it was beef TONGUE! Freaking;2
This was our first trip to Cuba, Feb 12th-19th).  We had an excellent time and met some wonderful Canadian folks and lovely Cubans.  The most important piece of advice I can impart is that you will get out of it what you put into it and keep your expectations realistic.  For the price, you cannot beat the sunshine, warm and clean pool and servicable rooms.  We were in an upper level bungalow which had a new bathroom, 'firm' bed and AC (a mini fridge too!).  We had no issues with theft as some other folks have reported, but also kept the room locked and valuables out of sight (not that we brought much of value with us - why tempt fate?).  The food - No Canadian will starve in Cuba if you just go with the flow. Bring black pepper, hot sauce, jam/peanut butter if you care to.;4
"I went there in february 2013 and since it was my first trip to Cuba I didn't know what to expect but I was very pleased with everything. I've heard stuffs about food in Cuba not being good etc. but when we were there it was really good, there was variety at the buffet and the pizza restaurant beside the buffet is really good (but you have to be there early for dinner!)  What truly stands out is the quality of the staffs, they are dedicated and will offer great services always with a smile (or almost), everyone at bars, buffet, etc. speaks good english and I even got served in french twice. Only one time the ""manager"" at the pizza restaurant was being rude with us because we asked when it would be ready but for the rest I don't have anything to say.  The pool is nice, rooms are";5
this hotel is actually 2 hotels in one...so you can go back and forth between the two as you please,with the beach in the middle of the 2...a friend of mine told me of this hotel and to come see her there...and that was about 5 years ago, and too this day, this is still my home away from home in Cuba...Santiago de Cuba has the nicest weather in January/Feb. months and I don't like to take chances when going on vacation of bad weather...always perfect/hot sunny  weather...many repeaters come here because they know from years experience this is the place to go in winter months...I love everything about this hotel,food was great,hotel beautiful,grounds amazing,and the beach staff and entertainment is outstanding...I fell in love with some many things here...not your 5 Star perfect;4
"Unless you dont mind starving, save yourself a lot of trouble and go elsewhere.  There is little to be desired about this hotel with the exception of many lovely staff.  The south of the island has limited access to supplies along with many items dissapearing from resort to help fill the gap at home...these workers are typically only working 4 months of the year.    I would consider this ""classy camping"" with the essentials you may carry in a vehicle while camping....classy for the fact you are not sleeping on the floor but rather a lumpy, hard bed. ?Essentially basic survival with as much as you would like to drink.    Just know what you are getting into before you go, if you desire more than ""classy camping"" pay a few bucks more and go elsewhere.  If you love hot hot hot with";2
Travelled Feb 19-26, mother (64) & daughter (27) - $578pp via CanadaTravels, Los Corales room 324  I did a great deal of research, reading reviews on here as well as other sites and comparing paying $200-$400 more if I was considerably more impressed.  There were some negative reviews but put into context and knowing I have an open mind, they were not overshadowed by the many positive reviews of return guests.  We went ahead and booked sometime in mid-January. N.B. - I have only had one other resort experience to compare to which was Feb2-9, 2013 4* Villa Cuba in Varadero.  Arrival & Settling In – My luggage (as well as another traveller's) was inadvertently left at the first resort we dropped people off to.  I attribute this to the fact that we were 4 hours late getting in and;4
When reading the reviews before leaving I got nervous that the resort wasn't great…. because everyone was bashing the place! Totally not the case, the resort is quite nice and staff are super friendly. Yes, there are some negatives but over all really great.   I spent most of my time by the beach as opposed to the pool (you can go to a pool anywhere). The beach was beautiful. Some parts on the sand are a little rocky, not even rocks… little stones, but either way, not bad... you wear flip flops anyway when walking.  The swimming was amazing! I did not wear water shoes. Yes it was seaweed-y in most parts, but there are other sections where you can go out deeper with no seaweed… most swimmers congregated here. The water is surprisingly warm. One annoying thing was you could go to;4
Horrible disgusting food. No selection bring diarrhea medicine.  Pool was dominated by obnoxious French Canadians. There was a joke of a hotel lobby with Moorhead begging ever where. You need to bring food. The food is inedible. Only the wandering donkeys can appreciate the all cabbage  buffets;1
Ok, let me start peeling the skin off my latest review by saying I owe a debt of gratitude to many people on my trip that have been so kind in helping me properly prepare. Exchange your money when you land in Cuba. Front desk runs out alot. One guy went on an excursion and had to use the rest of the money him and his girl had. A Canadian traveller actually gave him $80.00 to cover the going home Cuba tax, didn’t even know him!!! THAT my friend is a true Canadian! We booked through Sunwing and paid a bit extra for the Elite Service. Awesome! Pick your seats ahead of time and your luggage is hand delivered before everyone else’s when you get to Cuba and when you get back! No waiting!!! The large resort is divided between Corales (better) and Carisol (good). You will see a;4
"We just returned from a week at this resort (Feb 19 - 26). First off, we had a great week in the sun, got away from the snow, and met some amazing people who I hope we'll keep in touch with. I travelled with my 11yr old daughter, a mom and me trip, this was our first time to Santiago, but 5th trip to Cuba for my daughter and 6th for me. First, the hotel itself is older and is need of some repairs. This area was hit pretty hard by Sandy and they have not had much time or resources to repair some buildings; however, apparently they are closing in June to rebuild things like the beach restaurant/disco, dive centre and beach bar. All are currently tents. It is two resorts together and you have full access to both sides. I myself did  not venture over to the Carisol side, but our";4
Love you long time and I'll never forget you.  HEY YOU GUYSSSS!    FYI we paid $705 per person in peak winter travel season. This is like paying $100 a day for hotel, food and drinks for two people.  Now about Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales in Santiago de Cuba. No Sunwing, it's not called Santa Diago, it's Santiago. We arrived at the small airport and quickly transferred to our bus to discover that almost the entire flight was going to the same resort. We all boarded the buses for a one hour, thrilling, blood curdling bus ride to the resort - you drive on the left, the right, honk the horn and then take a detour because the road is broken.   Arrival: Check in was efficient, we were dropped at Corales and were actually staying at Corales unlike the people who had pushed in front;4
I was there 2 times and do not have many complains. the first time buffet just for dinner was so poor, but they changed that and second time dinner was very good. the resort is middle of nowhere and about 1 hour drive from Santiago de Cuba (by buss ). both times I was out of season ( Jun and September 2013) and there were not too many tourists ( sometimes just 10-15). nice place if you want really quite vacation. rooms are nice, clean with comfortable beds( tv with 15- 20 channels). large pool nice and clean  with bar in. service is good and staff always ready to help. at night animation shows usually dancers, magician, bingo.... only the beach is not beautiful like beaches in other cities on Cuba, but that is Santiago de Cuba (  grass and  stones in the water). the grill on the;3
"Hi, as a 24 year old Male who travelled to this resort this past reading week all I can really say is that I had a great time. I had heard before that this resort was generally an older person resort, but because the price was right, my friends and I decided ""hey why not"". I think what a lot of people (who have or have not travelled to Cuba in the past) need to realize is that when a price is a certain price, you essentially get what you get. Ya sure maybe the rooms aren't the greatest, but i've paid twice what I paid here for a 4 star resort in and Cayo Coco, and struggle to find the real difference between the two.   The only real differences are recognizable when you get there and say ""Hey I paid 660 to eat and drink for a week"" and maybe expect too much... Internet was";4
This hotel is excellent.  The service is great, very helpful and the food is good.  You can drink the tap water!!!!!!!! No issues.  After some bad hurricanes they have come back well.  The maid service is good and with access to both resorts there is plenty to do and see.  There was a wide variety of people from kids to university students and older people.  Plenty of shows and the disco was fun every night. Would go back anytime.;5
Just returned from a week at this resort, and I would like to say that i was satisfied with hotel and i think it was worth the price you pay. We stayed on the Carisol side and the room  was wonderful, quiet and clean.No complaints about the Room. The Resort Staff are always smiling and friendly You will need water shoes for the beach as there is still debris from Hurricane Sandy, that hit this part of Cuba pretty bad. There is also some Sea Weed. Wonderful Snorkeling right off the beach and at a nearby Coral Reef. There are 2 pools with have pool bars, you dont even need to get out of the pool if you want a drink.- The food is so so. Most of it was very plain and bland. The food at the Buffet was not marked so we didn't know what stuff was. Nevertheless, we always found stuff to;4
"I've written many reviews, but this is the first time I'm having problems staying positive.  To all the folks who love it there, good for you.  I'm disappointed though if you think this is as good as Cuba gets.  There are some wonderful 3 stars out there.    The people continue to be the most friendly around, and the weather is always guaranteed hot, this is Cuba.  I've often commented that in the last 15 years, the food has come a long way.  While staying true to Cuban food, food can be much more tasty or professionally prepared.  This resort was just bad.  The buffet were covered with flies.  The cooks; pasta and pizza wore latex disposable gloves to handle your food, but wore the same glove for the whole shift!  Two a la cartes, Cuban and Seafood, you book in the morning for";2
Stayed at Los Corales for a week the end of January. We hoped for warm weather and warm sea temperature - and we got that! Most days were 86F, breezy and low humidity, and the ocean was a comfortable 81F. We are beach and water people and our main peeve was that there were insufficient chairs on the beach. We had to get up early and reserve lounge chairs, and most of them were broken.  The water inside the nearby reef is quite shallow, and the snorkeling was limited in terms of tide and coral / fish. We did 4 scuba dives. The dive team was friendly  and provided fairly good  equipment. The under-water world lacked fish and much of the coral was silted and overgrown with moss & algae. Our room (bungalow) was clean although some broken light fixtures and the noisy air conditioner;3

My experience at this resort was not what I expected. First of all I have to warn people about bringing your camera. Apparently you are not allowed to take pictures or video when at this resort!! Let me explain, I was staying on the Carisol side and decided to go to the other side (Los Corales) to hang out at the pool. Spent the afternoon there enjoying the great sunshine. I have a new camera and decided to try and figure out how to film (video) with it. I was panning from left to right thinking I may have figured this out, totally concentrating on the camera and not my environment, when all of a sudden I had the Public Relations women from Carisol in my face and ripping the camera from my hands saying I am not allowed to take pictures or video on the resort and she threatened;2

We stayed at Los Corales. I've heard and seen that it's the better one to stay at. I went with my family, all over 50, me in my 20s. Our first impression wasn't very good but once we got our rest from travel we were ok. This is not a fancy place but the staff is nice overall and Santiago is hot all year round with minimal rain and a warm ocean. This is why we chose this location. You will have guaranteed wonderful weather.  Cuba is never the best for food but I didn't expect such little selection. It could have just been the time I was there. Some days they had toppings for burgers etc and some days not. Just bring spices and hot sauce, the cooks grilling will put it on your fish, beef etc when they grill for you and you should be ok to last.  Drinks are ok but I found I'd get;3
We visited Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales in January 2014. We had such a wonderful time, I can't begin to remember everything! We could only stay for a week, but we hope for two weeks next January or February, and if we can get back sooner, we certainly will.  This is a Cuban, 3-star, operation. It is not at all fancy. If you're looking for something all shiny and corporate, keep looking. (Might I suggest Paradise Island, Bahamas, where you will stay 2 nights for the price of a week here!) If, however, you want a nice, relaxing place to hang out, have excellent and sincere service, perfect mojitos, perfect sunshine, and snorkelling right off the beach, then this is the place. Added bonus--rock-bottom prices!  This is really two resorts side-by-side. Los Corales is the one that;5
We stayed at carisol. Sunwing lost our luggage and never found it as promised. We found it about 2 hrs later at the other resort.Guy at the front desk very rude and would only give 1 key. We offered to pay for an extra as this was very inconvenient ,but no go.Nor he would not give us the key but gave it to the rudest person in the resort, a guy in blue coveralls who found a tip not what he wanted so he stared us down and violently slammed the door. We had no luggage and were only 50 ft from the front lobby by the way. The only other bad thing was getting ripped off for 20 bucks by the xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx. Good news! The food was adequate and even better if you go to corales. The pizza and pasta bar was quite good at carisol All of the employees were excellent,from maintenance to;3
This hotel was a really great authentic Cuban experience.  The cost was amazing for what we got.  Loved seeing all the animals and meeting so many great people.  Snorkelling off the beach was lots of fun.  The food was average, the pasta/pizza and morning omelettes were delicious.  Thanks to some of the great staff.  Rosetta (NO CHEESE!!), the lovely nurse, Barbaro the Sunwing rep and the fun bartenders.  Loved the different musicians who played at the dinner buffets.  Can't wait to go back soon!;3
We had a very nice vacation . Very clean and well maintained room. Food was adequate . Pools sparkling clean and a good temperature . The clean up from the hurricane was evident around the resort in the past year and the sunshades at the beach are slowly being replaced.  Great value for the price we paid !!;4
For the price it was great. Food was taste, staff were friendly.  My buddy was already there 3 times before and he invited me. He love to scuba dive great for that. Keep an open mind for the price your paying. It is a really big place, Lots to see and very safe.;4
My wife and I took 12 friends with us this time to Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales.  Our last visit was in April 2013.  We stayed in room 113 on the Corales side.  Once again the weather was great, the pool was great and the drinks didn't stop flowing.  Yes, there are farm animals roaming around, but I think it adds excitement to the place.  The food continues to be surprisingly good for a 3 star resort.  Whoever bakes the bread everyday . . WOW.  Amazing fresh bread daily.  During my stay I ate eggs, toast and pancakes in the morning, pizza and spaghetti for lunch and rice, cabbage and squash for dinner.  Sometime we would get late night sandwiches at the 24 hour bar.  Not to bad, very tasty.   The entertainment was better than the last time we were at the resort.  I find the;3
"Just returned from a wonderful week in Santiago de Cuba, at the Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales resort. Once again, I wish I was still there. I have travelled to this resort many times and will certainly continue to do so in the future. This time, I have noticed many changes at the hotel. First, they are under new management. This means that staff who were not quite doing their jobs in certain positions were replaced. There is a new P.R. Person and she really gives it her all.  The grounds are cleaner, the food was so much better, the service was faster. Second, I have noticed that things ""work"" better.  The shower and water pressure was good, there was a new toilet in our room,. we did not lose electricity once. Third, they have switched a few things around to make it a little";4
"Travel alert: Bring cash to Los Corales. Credit cards are not accepted and you must travel two hours to get a cash advance.

We just returned on Jan. 22 from a two week stay at the Club Amigo in Santiago de Cuba. This resort is a merger of two resorts, the Carisol and Los Corales. We stayed in an oceanview bungalow on the Los Corales side.The food and entertainment at this resort was much better than expected. The variety of food was greater than expected and actually had more flavour than many other Cuban resorts we have experienced. I have to admit however that after a week I do start to get a little bored with the food at most resorts. The entertainment 5 nights out of 7 was excellent. The beach is not that great compared to other parts of Cuba because it is much more volcanic mixed with coral. If you are a snorkler or diver it is a great place especially just out by the reef. That being said, we;4
Friends and Staff are what make our vacations, and they are great at Los Corales. Bersu, Julio and Big O to name a few. Baseball is a good outing if in season, talk to Julio if you want to go. If you need anything talk to Bersu, Big O or Julio;4
Just got back on the 22nd. Again a wonderful trip.   Food was amazing and lots of it. Not sure what people complain about. Unless they are expecting filet minion.   Had a bungalow this time and it was quieter but do prefer pool side so I can just leave my patio door unlocked and go in and out easier. Yes. I leave my door unlocked. Even the bungalow. Never have an issue of stolen items or anyone in my room.   Lobster at the restaurant next door is a must. Love hanging out with my now cuban friends after dinner having some drinks and dancing. Ridell. Victor. Daisy. Omar.   Staff are more than accommodating considering the demands that tourists put on them. Be nice and they will be nice back. Common courtesy. Just because they don't have much and live in a poor country does not;5
In less than a month we are headed back to Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales for our third time in 14 months .... We always go for two weeks ....We went in Feb 2013 and November 2013 and both times took a group of ten people with us.....We have travelled Cuba for the last ten years, all around the island and several different resorts..... this area of the island is our favourite because of the weather, people, proximity to the city, etc.....The resort itself is a 3.5 star but we always feel like we get good value for our money ..... Our rooms have always been presentable and clean .....You can always find something to eat at the buffet ......Snorklers and divers are quite happy with the beach and the dive team .......Most of the staff are outstanding and very accommodating.... The;4
Just got back on the 22nd and wish we were still there not because of our cold weather but because this resort is just fabulous. This was our second time here The staff are out of this world and will help you anyway they can. The rooms even though out dated are still very clean. We stayed on the Corales side cause we love this side but a lot of people also like the Carisol side so it is a personal preference.  This trip it was only my husband and myself and still had fun with all the other vacationers. Got to go down to the beach this time and it is full of coral at the side but looks very nice otherwise. Just make sure you wear watershoes etc. They have a snack bar/disco down there also a beach bar and scuba. We spent most of our time at the pool. They had music playing most of;5
We travelled in a group with 4 kids and 6 adults and had a wonderful time. We were in the 400 block with no complaints. The kids (under the age of 8) loved the pool. The staff was amazing and the rooms were very clean. We even enjoyed the food!! Only complaint I had was the shower water pressure...but wasnt a make or break for me!! I cant wait to go back;5
This my second time at this hotel.  I have no complaints at all.  Everything was beautiful.  If people stop saying the food sucks maybe you will realize that is does not.  We always found delicious things that we loved there is something for everyone.  We didn't over eat (lost weight on the trip) because it is actually pretty healthy as well.  Rooms are clean, if you normally use facecloths bring your own. (not a big deal)  Beach is amazing - I enjoy it very much has lots of character and snorkeling is great.  Staff are wonderful, warm and so much fun.;5
"From the other reviews, we had low expectations of this resort however once we got there, we had an awesome time.  We were a little confused when reading the reviews as to the layout of the resort so let me clear up the confusion.  Yes, there are two resorts side by side - Los Corales and Carisol.  Each has its own buffets and pools however they share the same beach. It appeared to us that the action/party in the afternoon was at our pool.  We stayed in ""B"" Bungalow at Los Corales which was away from the pool but still close the to buffet, lobby, pool and the beach.     Our room was clean but we did not spend much time there so as long as it was clean we did not care!  The buffet was typical and there was two a la carte restaurants which were both delicious.  There is a";4
Visited this resort (the Carisol side) with a group of friends in early January. We had a lovely time, and would go again. The resort, beach and coral are still recovering from Hurricane Sandy, but work is underway in Cuba time!  The rooms: were clean and made up each day, but the sheets not washed unless requested. And the 500 block, 2nd floor was surprisingly quiet at night. Never heard any of the nightly entertainment (good for this early to bed, early to rise person!)  The food: sufficient. The grill was open all three meals. The buffet cooled quickly...but I didn't have to cook, so still fine. Was nice to get a hamburger or pizza at Los Corales. Only hicks - finding food in the afternoon after 2 until supper, and flies on uncovered food.   Water: Really hot in the room!;3
The high spots: 1. Food: Buffet - beef 4 nights a surprise for sure, good grill service with fish, chicken, pork. Always rice and beans (good) and other veggies, ice cream and cakes and even pie one night. Ala carte was OK but small portion for a big eater. Burgers at pool bar were very good. Pizza and made to order pasta was good but only open 2 nights of our week. Overall I was expecting much worse food  - a pleasant surprise  2. Staff - very friendly service, equal with or without a tip. Chambermaid was efficient nothing special.  3. Room & Bath  - clean, spacious, shower worked well with hot water everyday  4. Pool and Deck - very nice and large with a swim up bar, cleaned with regularity.   5. Grounds - nothing special, clean and maintained but no rain makes for some;3
Ohhhh people.... If you go there for $500-$700/ week, its Cuba !!!!stop complaining !!!! Staff is great- Ovidio, Ivan, Juliet, Frank, Ellian , etc. So, yes sometime the public bathroom run out of toilet paper (make sure you've got your own supply in your pocket/purse), food is blawww  - everywhere in Cuba (bring your own ketchup,peanut butter, ramen noodle, whathever)...... Where else can u go for a week in Canada with room, food, alcool, flight for $500-$700 ???? Dont like it there, pay a one way flight ottawa-bathurst for $1200 and try to have as much fun and great weather, staff for 7 days stay .... Carisol Los Corales is just GREAT !!!!;5
We went on a family/scuba group vacation from January 5 to 12.  We landed at about 10:30 in the evening, bus ride was approximately 1 hour from the airport to the hotel.  Weather was BEAUTIFUL!  Over 30 degrees, sunny and we never saw rain!  When we arrived, the check in process took a long time, there was one attendant at the desk and we (with many others) were not “on the list” to stay at Carisol.  Our entire bus was dropped off at Carisol we later found out that many of us should have been dropped off at Los Corales.  They took care of everyone on the list and then served us.  Our reservation used multiple travel agents so it was not an agent issue it was a resort issue.  We finally got to our rooms by about 1am.  Rooms: We stayed in the 100 block (rooms 106 – first floor and;4
Just back from a week at Carisol side with the family! Wonderful time!   Our side of the resort was full or close to full as there were limited rooms available at check in and a large group as well,  This side was hit harder by the hurricane and you can see lots of debris and yet to be repaired buildings to the right of the front of the resort and behind block 500.  It is slowly being repaired.  The gardeners were planting new seedlings, fixing edging and completing other repairs.   Los Corales looks nicer, has more activities going on and slightly more food choice. I think this side gets filled first. But, the rooms are apparently smaller and there is more noise around the pool and resort area.  Initial evening reception was horrid with us not being on room list and no;4
I stayed at the Carisol section from Dec. 29, 2014 to January 5, 2014 - this was my 6th time in Cuba so I thought I knew what to expect.  I was very disappointed - the room we were put in smelled of mold and the toilette stank (there must have been something wrong with the sewage system), the furniture was worn-out, the bathroom door had a whole in the middle (someone must have kicked it in), the ceiling was peeling, there was no worm water, the mirror in the bathroom was cracked, the shower unit was disgusting.   My several requests to change the room fell on death ears and I eventually gave up. There were a section between the Carisol and Los Corales which was littered with debris from past hurricanes and animal excrements.  The beach has shrunk considerably since past years;2
When we first arrived at this vacation destination we did not have high expectations but we did expect to have TP. We were without toilet paper for 3 out of 7 days. To help matters two out of our group of three got from fairly ill to severely ill due to the food. The only saving graces of this resort is the affiliated scuba diving center and weather. The master diver Ernesto is very safe and knowledgeable. The price is around 30 CUC per dive, one dive boat. If you planning on traveling here bring toilet paper, eat off the resort and bring your dive gear.;2
"We spent a week here in November 2013 and was fully expecting a 2.5 star hotel but we were wonderfully surprised when it turned out to be a ""5"" star.  We stayed in the units facing the pool with a balcony. Get a room on the second floor and you will have a great place to watch the pool and enjoy the music.  Pool was clean. The food was typical Cuban resort food.  Take peanut butter,  salad dressings and a few other small treats if you want a small taste of home. Excellent coffee served at the bar by the pool. You are a little ways out from Santiago but this city is worth a day trip.  We hired Jorge the cab driver for our trips and found him to be fair. His  English is not the very best but you can get by. Horse and cart rides are available just outside the resort and it is worth";4
Let me preface this by saying that we have been to Cuba 10 times and to 8 different resorts most of them less than 4 stars as we tend to like the smaller resorts - so we know what to expect when you go to Cuba. I agree with much of the two reviews I just read.  We also went there from Dec. 25 - Jan 1. The food was definitely the worst we have ever had - very limited selection - hardly any meat or fruit - no bananas - We saw other tourists hoarding food when the good stuff came out and there was some bribing of staff for fruits and bananas.  The staff would help themselves to plates of food before the tourists had all eaten and they would run out of things - I have no issue with the staff eating - they should just wait till everyone is done (we pay for the food and sometimes we;2
You are not going there for the food!  If you are vegetarian you will fair better!.  Hardly any meat offered and what was usually a fish, some pork, there was some lamb Christmas night. Roast beef but very dried out and made into stew for supper.  Christmas day there were  no dishes for lunch or dinner.  Coffee is not served at lunch or dinner just breakfast.  Desserts were usually cake or cookies.  Fruit was very limited and you had to get them to cut it up. It always looked like there was none available.  Lunch and Dinner was usually the same vegetable, squash, cabbage, couple kinds of rice, some cold pasta and a salad bar and fresh bread.  Breakfast by far was the best meal of the day.  Omelets or eggs and bacon (which was good) but limited,pancakes, french toast, bread,;2
All of the comments before is correct. Stayed at this resort Dec 25-Jan 01,2013 and paid over $1000 so we expected a little more.The food was always under cooked making all the guest in the resort sick so you should aways on eat the food that is fully cooked . The Carisol section was completely sick from the seafood a la carte. Word of advise before you go to your room take your keys and check out your room.The Carisol section is about five minute walk to Corales so if you mobility issues you would be stuck in Carisol section.Corales is more busy and a lot more activities for younger people. And the resort could use the same ingredients and make a lot more dishes and serve it hot rather than just making lunch and dinner two hours before. So definitely this resort has management;2
"Words of advise: bring food and water in your checked luggage. There is a one hour bus ride and no food is offered. As a result when you arrive you'll be ""hangry"", a terrible combination of hungry and angry.   The Highlights:  1. Crystal clear water  2. Warm Caribbean Sea beach  3. Snorkelling is spectacular, I'm a novice, I've never snorkelled before, it was amazing all the fish you could see, just steps from the shore!  4. Evening entertainment was great, 90% of the time! the entertainers are very talented and multi-lingual.  5. Friendly and accommodating staff.  6. The tour guides are knowledgable, friendly and multi-lingual.  7. Swimming with dolphins was very cool.  8. Catamaran sailing with Frank, was the high-light of my trip.  9. This area of Cuba is rugged and remote.";3
Visited this area for the first time.  My trip to Baconao last year was called off after my hotel (Bucanero) got completely destroyed.   Stayed in the Los Corales section.  Carisol was not fully operational until the high season.   Room: stayed in section 400 second floor. Great spot. Close to the pool and beach access with less noise. The disco is on the beach, so it's basically impossible to hear noise after hours.   Food: plentiful and varied. Staples were fish and chicken. Rice and vegetables as sides.  Deserts and ice cream.    Morning offerings of omelette and fruit/cereal.   Drinks: all the basics were there. The lobby bar has a better selection f spirits including Cinzano and Martini. The other bars were ok and the bartenders always nice.   Store: all the bare;4
This was our 4th trip to Cuba, we wanted to explore a bit the Santiago area as we haven't been there before. The resort is nice, fairly well maintained, we paid a bit extra for an ocean view bungalow and it was worth it: the room was much more spacious, well kept (a few small gifts to the cleaning lady helped probably too), with a large balcony and lovely view. Relatively quiet, but we could hear the disco noise until late in the night. Make sure you bring ear plugs. And mosquito repellent, if you are sensitive to insect bites. There were some small ants on the balcony and in the bathroom, but we were prepared with a can of Raid.  The staff was rather friendly, but be expected to tip. It is really not much for a Canadian budget and it means a lot for Cubans.  The food was the;3
"This was my second trip to Baconao. The first time I stayed at Costa Morena, but this time I thought I'd try something new. Before I go any further I see a lot of comments from people regarding how much they appreciated the quiet, but then they rank sleep quality fairly low. I wonder why. The beds are too hard and the pillows are too over-stuffed for me to get a good night's sleep. To remedy this, I always pack a 4' x 3' piece of light-weight El Cheapo 1.5""-thick egg-crate mattress topper in my checked baggage, and a thin feather pillow in my carry-on so that I can use it during the flight (and for my back on those bumpy rides in Cuba).   The room was clean, the water hot, and everything worked. The room service was good, and the cleaning staff were very nice and friendly. Some";5
This was my second trip to Cuba, first at Club Amigo, I travelled alone to this resort and was very pleased, stayed 2 nights at Carisol the rest of the time at Corales,. Nov.20 until Nov 27th., 2013. weather was excellent, rooms very clean, plenty of food that I liked., my only problems were my health issues, I found  at the resort there was too much walking for me, aside from that I found it to be a very pleasant and relaxing place.would definitely recommend it for young , healthy people. I also enjoyed the stray animals roaming about, they didn't bother anyone, just wanted a little handout, aside from this staff were very nice and friendly., pool was excellent, loved the ocean, my room was  E2, bungalow by the beach, lovely area.;5
This is our second trip to this resort in 2013. We plan on returning in 2014. Why because $ for $ it is not the best hotel in Cuba, BUT for weather it is guaranteed sunshine day in day out. Dollar value it is a 3* and that is what you pay for. Ya it's not the best beach but hey the water temp was 85 all week be it at the surface or at 100 feet. Yes I scuba dive. :) if any questions about the diving flip me a PM… Ya they run out of vodka or juice or butter or other but to us it's no big deal. we just keep saying how economical this trip is and that brightens our holiday. Staff is very friendly as they are in most Cuban resorts.   Stay was Nov 27- Dec 4 from Montreal;4
Just got back from two weeks in sunny Cuba, 2nd time at this resort, food was very good, staff friendly, weather hot.  The beach had suffered some damage from Hurricane Sandy but the sea was lovely and warm.   Do not expect 5 star for 3 star prices people !!!;4
I have been to Cuba 11 times. I have to say this was the worst beach I've ever seen in Cuba. I travelled here close to beginning of Nov. 2013. When I left home I was worried because the weather had showed 5 days of rain. It rained the day after we got there in the evening for about 1 hour. That was all the rain I saw all week. So don't always go by the weather charts. It was very hot here. 45 with the humid x. Which was fine if your by the water or pool but to go to the city OMG couldn't wait to get back on the bus. The ocean water was warmer than the pool. I have never been in ocean water that warm. It was nice. This would be a good place to go in mid winter. The food here really sucked. And make sure you bring enough money with you because you will have to go to the city of;2
Workers are fantastics and everything was nice except the food temperature. Everything was cold like meat and potatoes while salads were getting hot... But the food from the grill was perfect and the bread and desserts were always fresh and delicious.;3
"To be brief my Cuban friend begged me to come. He didnt tell me he had not made reservation till we got the. Yikes. The beautful internet photos are misleading. Food was hit or miss with days with no vegetables. Avocado  is out of season I think. I saw none. My Cuban friend complained of smelling smoke in his room for $52/night but there was hell to pay. When we returned from a trip that evening we were locked out of all three of our rooms. I saw the old men with escorts, mean/bored with cuba looking staff, unkempt grounds. Some great ice cream before it ran out, the pool was nice, my room was clean and most of the staff were nice. I do not want to spend money on a place like this again. The whole trip if something goes wrong ""Its Cuba.....""";3
"My wife and I are frequent travelers to Cuba and we do not have high expectations ,and up till this resort we were always pleased with the visit.To start with the way the food was laid out was disturbing,the birds and insects were landing on the plates and eating from them the dishes were not very clean either.Then there was the older men who were seen and heard paying employees at the resort for what they call escorts  but actually there were about 10 men i seen with 15-16 year old girls and this was seen by the staff .We mentioned it to them and they said ""they do not allow that "" (ya right )they also were changing the exchange rate on canadian currency and would not give us a print out of our exchange.some were getting 80-90%of their exchanges.Then there was the outings";1
The hotel was recommended to me by another person and they did not disappoint.  The hotel is good, the staff are excellent and the food was great.  Loved two weeks of beach, pool and bar.  Please note there are no telephones or internet yaaaaaaaaaaaa.  But there is lots of sun and fun to be had by all.;5
This was my second time to this resort i went with a friend Aug 12 for 1 week . I had so much fun it was very hot 46 with humidity we stayed in shad most of the time . the staff was great i loved my bartender Renaldo very sweet man if you go bring him shavers very expensive for him to get there.My housekeeper was awesome my air conditioner broke and i waited all day for someone to come. She came and moved my stuff to another room and then told front desk i moved . we didnt have water for 3 days but we made the most of a bad situation they brought us jugs of water and our housekeeper came in and flushed toilets. They gave us a free trip to city and a very nice lunch.When you go be sure to take in the beautiful  surroundings and all the little issues wont seem so bad . my friend;5
The first thing to do before you leave is to buy things that they dont have in Cuba . such as tooth paste . Then give it to the people who do things for you while you are on vacation. Beats having to tip.They expect tips even in the all inclusive resorts. God forbid you don't have money in the local currency.Secondly, drinks are cheaper than water,God forbid you ask for a glass.So take small bills always.;3
we just made our third trip to this hotel in 2013. We loved everything about this resort, especially the staff. The food, pool, waterfront, rooms, service and everything else was wonderful. The hotel is very clean, well managed and other than needing some cosmetic repairs, the property was amazing. We loved the food, always fresh and well presented. The staff went beyond everything to make the holiday enjoyable. We had bonfires on the beach, a trip down a nearby river, with cliff jumping, the traditional trip into Santiago, twenty dollar, one hour massages by nurses at the resort, We quickly became a group of about twenty Canadians and some Cuban folks who had so much fun throughout the whole week. Thank you so much, to all of the staff and management. We will all be back again;4
Been going to this hotel for 5 years now and still going back. The staff are very caring and fun. The diving is great the dive masters and captain Landy are the best. The weather is always nice and hot. You can't go wrong with the price.;5
We have traveled to Cuba once or twice a year since 2005 and always go to a three star resort.  As usual the staff is wonderful - friendly, full of smiles, do not ask for tips or expect tips, however a peso will go a very long way in better service at the bars - do not have to go back the bar as the bartender will bring you your drinks to the table and insure you always have one.  The swim up bartender was so attentive that if you made move for your cigarettes he was there with a lighter!!!  The gardens are incredible and very well maintained by an older gentleman who has been there for 19 years and the topiary  bushes exceeds any I have seen at a Cuban resort.   We were there in a very off season - which is from, what we understand as being from May - December. 15 at the resort;2
Love the atmosphere and people that work at this amazing little resort on the beach.  My son and I stayed for two weeks and were treated so nicely that we were both in tears when we had to return home.  They really made us feel like we were a family and gave so much kindness and care ...although not a luxury resort by any mean, we were able to wonder out of the resort and meet real Cuban people.  Their culture and hospitality and beautiful mountains were all we needed.  Thank you Amigos! Viva Cuba :);4
I went with some friends at the end of April-beginning of May 2013.  The price was right.  The rooms are OK, the resort nice, the beach was good for snorkeling, the food was poor, even by Cuban standards.  This was my 7th time in Cuba and I have typically traveled 3* or 4*.  The hotel was only partially full, about 90 guests I believe.  Breakfast was typical fare, I ate omelets each morning.  Lunch was had at the pasta/pizza section of the buffet.  Now dinner was a huge disappointment.  I'm not sure what the meat of the evening was and seeing the huge platter of fish heads on the buffet left much to be be desired.  The food was quite repetitive.  Some guests I met had been to the resort several previous times and were also very disappointed in what they considered a huge;2
We went at the end of March 2013 for one week.  You could see the areas that were affected by the huricane previously.  There was no butter on the resort at all.  Turns out there was none on the island.    A group of us booked a lobster dinner at the restaurant just off the resort, unfortunately there was a power outage & they did not cancel the dinner. It was pretty dark at that time, used flashlights on cell phone to see what we were eating. Food was a little tough.  May have been better if there was power.  We were in the Los Corales section.  Everything was well laid out.  We were just steps from the pool and entertainment stage.  The lobby, bars & restaurants were in the surrounding buildings.  A few of the waitresses at the buffet couldn't care less if you were there, but;4
This is a fantastic resort for the money you will pay. The Cubans are very warm people. Santiago de Cuba is situated in a little more rugged part of the island and is often a few degrees warmer than Varadero being at the southern part of the island. We love the beach and found it consistently quiet and under used. Beautiful clear water. We have been here several times and would go again. We always bring a cheap sponge mattress pad and leave it behind as the beds are not too luxurious. So no one goes to Cuba for the food and this place is no different. However, having said that we have found some pluses to some of the food. Dairy and ice cream are fantastic. It will remind you of what dairy used to taste like when you where a kid. Old time farming = no chemicals, no growth;5

"What a disappointment. Barely worth two stars. Resort is isolated, about an hour away from Santiago de Cuba down a dangerous and lonely road. As it was ""off-season"" only 30 people at Corales section. Beach was rocky and dangerous to access -- you have to cross a large field, riddled with weeds, rocks, broken glass and sharp coral. Most of the water is riddled with sea grass, only small pockets are swimmable. Rocks and sharp coral also cover the beach and water making it dangerous. Animals such as horses, cows, pigs and chickens run wild here, so the entire resort is liberally mined with feces.  Activities: not much. Entertainment is sporadic and poor. Food is terrible, especially for vegetarians and choosy eaters. The food is also covered with flies and is regularly pecked at by";2
"First time in Cuba and after reading the bad reviews we were a little worry, but we do not regret we took that last minute deal of $512/person all inclusive; for a 3 stars resort is was amazing, it could be 4 or 4.5 very easy.  Buy Cigaretes in resort is cheaper than in Santiago;buy rum in their shop at resort is the same price like in airport in Cuba;take a taxi (the one with a horse) outsite of resort to vizit around because is only $2 besides the one organized by resort for $60?Take the trip to Santiago de Cuba it's worth.";5
First off there is two sides to this resort the carisol and then corals and a distance in between. We mainly stayed on the carisol side as it was much better and the bungalows were excellent as they face the ocean although they may be missing some curtains due to the hurricane. The food in general was pretty bad at supper and sometimes relied on eating my peanut butter from home and their bread as it was good. Lunch they have an excellent pizza restaurant but go early. Breakfast was okay but repetitious but the omelet bar is excellent. pools were good. bars were good at the carisol swim up bar especially francesco , if anyone deserves a tip it is him. He had lost his roof on his house from the hurricane and was saving to replace it. Always very happy and likes to joke around.;2
Absolutely horrible.  No activites other than Bingo on our last night there.  You couldnt use any of the courts because they were full of animal feces.  The buffet they expected us to eat at was absolutly horrendous.  I realize this is not Canadian Standards but to have to swat away flies and make sure there is no bird crap on your food is just unreasonable...even for this country!!  Thank goodness the pool was clean and service was pretty friendly. Thats about it.  Been to Cuba twice before at the same star resorts and have never had such a horrible experience!!  But apparently thats ok....our pictures and complaints got us nowhere!!!!;1
I just returned from the Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales, Santiago de Cuba, Cuba.  The rooms were in need of repair  -closet and shower doors, need light bulbs often in rooms,  The staff however were terrific.  Food lacking variety but they do the best they can. Little fresh fruit this time of year.  Scuba average experience but consistent.   There is a small black and white dog I call Cuban Tippy I wanted to adopt but ran out of time.  PLEASE watch for her.  about a 3 inch white tip on her tail, small streak of white on the top of her head,  white around the neck, four white socks.  She might be 15 pounds, probably less.  Formed an immediate attachment.  Slept on our doorstep B5.  Swam a fair way out into the ocean following me in the dive boat.  We had to return to take her to;3
I just came back for a short vacation with my family from Cuba. We have a nice time and enjoy the accommodations.The kids had fun playing in the pool all day.The staff was friendly and helpful in every way possible and they treat you like royalty!The food was traditional style Cuba very good breakfast which we all enjoyed. Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales is in a great location.  The room we got was  fabulous, with a very comfortable bed and good well lit bathroom with all the facilities you expect in a 4-star hotel. We were very happy to have chosen such a hotel.;4
We just returned from Santiago de Cuba. Some areas of this resort needs updating. We wanted to be close to the pool and were placed in the old section. The water pressure in the room was good. There was not a lot of bugs. It was nice and hot. The food was normal for Cuba. They are slow to replenish. It was very emotional listening to their stories of hurricane Sandy that did a lot of damage to the area. Due to the hurrican the beach is now maybe a 2 star but the pool was nice. All the staff were friendly. There are so many resorts to vacation at I would not return to this resort unless it was an amazing price.;3
This is my forth time to Los Corales,Carisol resort.and 17.to Cuba.Also went to Mexico,Bahamas,Punta Cana,Panama,Hawaii,Florida, Europe...many cruises,but keep going to Los Corales for the fabulous weather,friendly people,nice beach,calm water,never red flag on the beach.The resort was hit by hurrican Sandy,but to my surprise very clean. Staff work very hard to clean up the place.Lost some trees on the beach but no problem still planty of trees left and lots of shads.Some rocks on the beach,but still planty space of white send on the beach and in the ocean to swim.Lots of chars.Love taking a walk in the morning and admire beautiful scenery,going to the village,very safe place.Food was good,lots of chicken,fish,pork chops,beef,fresh vegetobles,fresh fruit and juice,eggs, fresh;4
My wife and I vacationed at Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales from April 14th-21st 2013.  This was our 5th trip to Cuba have stayed in Varadero, Santa Lucia and Cayo Santa Maria previously.  We chose this resort because of the price.  We paid $188 plus taxes each for the week.  We read the reviews before we booked and decided to take a chance on this 3 star resort based on the reviews.  We stayed in a super saver room, which is no different from the rest.  It was large, spacious and clean.  No problems.  We really enjoyed the large pool area with the pool bar.  Beautiful views from the pool.  All the staff was nice and helpful.  The food was average for Cuba, we always found something to eat daily.  The bread was amazing.  Delicious, fresh every day.  My compliments to the baker.;3
Ok lets see if I can get this right this time. I did post one yesterday but somehow it was messed up. sorry. Anyway we were at this resort from Apr 10-17th and as far as we are concerned not long enough. I can not say enough about the staff at this resort they are all just wonderful. They have always got a smile on their faces. From the gardeners, to housekeeping, to front desk everyone. well except for Oscar, we called him Oscar the grouch and he did smile then and left it on. lol Spent a lot of time at the swim-up bar as it was very hot out. Well that is our excuse anyway. Ovidio, his wife and Ivan kept us all topped up and Ovidio was very entertaining. I took the makings for jello shots and he loved them so much that he brought me more jello from town.  Food well it is Cuba;5
Really enjoyed my stay.  The staff are very friendly and it's very safe.  It is a bit out of the way but for beach bums and pool lovers you will enjoy.  Lots of dogs and cats around, they are wild but are very friendly;3
Travelled to Los Corales from April 3rs to 10th, with my mother, brother and aunt and uncle. This was my 7th visit to Los Corales and I will definitely return.  We booked a bungalow and our room was very nice. It was clean and had everything we needed. Our maid, Yamila, was wonderful. There were 3 of us in our room, so we asked for extra towels and they were left for us within an hour.  Our room was cleaned every day and fresh towels left daily.  The food on this trip was not so great. However, we were never hungry. There was always something to eat.  We organized a pig roast for our last night, and it was absolutely fantastic. We were given a separate area in the buffet and our own waitresses - Rolandis and Jaqueline. They were amazing. Kudos to Eduardo the chef and all his;4
I was there at the beginning of the April for 2 weeks. This was my 4th time at this resort and the 1st time after hurricane Sandy. There is probably ¼ less trees on the beach, hence less shade but better view. Beach seems to be OK and I saw people in the ocean as well swimming and snorkeling. There was also good crowd doing scuba diving. The weather was just amazing, as usually it is there.  The accommodation seems to be at the same level. If you get unlucky and something was wrong in your room and they could fix it, they would do that promptly.  I think that food was better and they were not running out of better stuff. You have to be just patient and wait until they bring more. I gained few pounds  Drinks were very good. I stayed this time with red wine and beer, both very;4
Our “go with the flow” philosophy was tested on arrival at Los Corales.  We received the upper floor in the block that we requested and were quite pleased with the condition of the room:  two firm double beds in a clean, bright vaulted-ceiling room. The bathroom was spacious with clean towels, soap and shower gel – although no shampoo.  This was all good! But, when we opened the closet door there was severe black mold on the bottom half of the wall.  We returned to the front desk, where the staffer did not believe us nor could he do anything since the hotel was full. So, we pulled one of our beds out to the very private front terrace on the second floor and slept under the stars.  It was actually great other than having the rooster crow every hour on the hour. LOL.  The next;3
Visited this resort April 3-10.  The staff were fantastic and willing to help in ANY way.  The grounds were clean for the most part. Yes there is horse feces all over the sand and grass areas and obvious issues/damage form the hurricane but overall, clean facilities and rooms. This being said, the public washroom near lobby was always in poor shape - missing toilet seat, never any towels or toilet paper.  The stray dogs and cats everywhere didn't really bug us as they do not jump up or beg. If you don't want to pet or feed them, they will walk away looking for someone who will.  The pool and the pool bar are fantastic. Clean, refreshing and the bar staff are second to none.  The food was very repetitive and bland. Many meals were without a meat dish or the only meat dish was;4
I vacationed at  Los Corales April 3-10th 2013. This time I travelled with my husband and my 5 year old Granddaughter. The hotel was full, the bars were pretty much stocked ( a few issues at different times with  pop).  I was given a room 505.When we went there, I noticed  an issue with a leaking air conditioner which left some mould on the wall. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk and my Rep, they did everything they could to get me a room. They gave us a Bungalow. My room was clean,the bed was not the best, and the furniture could have used a bit of paint however, the maid took the bedspread right out of the package so our beds were very fresh.   The shower had an abundance of hot water, extra towels were provided without asking once our chambermaid saw we;4
My husband and I, both love Cuba and go every year, sometimes twice a year. This was the worst place that we have ever stayed. We went expecting a typical Cuban 3 star vacation, even took food and snacks knowing from the reviews that there was not a lot of certain things.  The horror of seeing and hearing prostitution transactions being made in the vicinity of  families with young children was unbelievable. There is no way that the tour operators should let decent people go to places where this is so obviously common place!!!!!  Some of the staff were wonderful, but a lot were only friendly when they saw something that you had and they wanted...... and asked outright for you to give it them. I was asked for the clothes that I was wearing, my jewelery, coffee cup, shoes etc etc.;2
My wife and I have been to Cuba many times and we do not expect much. This resort was very dirty, the food was worse than bad, and the rampant prostitution were some of the reasons for this report. The prostitutes were pre-arranged and greated their clients right off the bus. Worse than that they were allowed free range of the resort. The entertainment girls were prostitutes as well. The landscaping crew spent their time selling coconuts to the tourists. If we had our 16 year old daughter with us, we would have had to watch over her constantly. Meanwhile the resort grounds are not being kept up.  There was animal feces on the sidewalk by the stairs to the 200 block that someone had slipped on.  This was reported but the feces was not cleaned up for amost 4 days.  The beds were;1
Making the best of a poor situation would be to say the least! I have never been so disappointed to say I was a Canadian, I have to say!!! On the plane back, I was so furious at some of the Men on the plane! I was in shock at the amount of open Prostitution on this Resort!! 60 to 70 year old Men with 13 to 14 year old girls, made me sick!!! I have been to Cuba Many times, but this was the absolute worse!! All day long and in your face.  No Safe in the Ocean Front Bungalows!! Hurricane Sandy Killed the Beach!! Food was Terrible!! Tons of Rice!! No Toilet Paper!! Entertainers begging me to go get them Hamburgers!! No washroom on the bus to resort!! Ran out of Beer!! 4 days to get towels!! Dogs, they are constant at your table!! I wasn't expecting a lot--trust me, but this----this;2
I have been to Cuba 11 times now so know what to expect.Ages were 29,33,51,53,54 and we were there Mar.20-27 We had a wonderful time resort was ok food was not the greatest. Two nights we didn't eat except for some bread. The other nights the best thing was the rice and chicken.The meat on the grill was always nice. Did not enjoy the seafood but the Cuban was good.The weather was perfect the pools and resort were clean staff very friendly. We did have $10 taken from a pocket the day before we left. Went to our room to find five cleaners in there. Asked what threy all were doing and they left. Think more would have been gone except  I have always locked my suit case the second last day of each vacation. If they are going to take something you have no time to deal with it so they;3
"I was at this resort March 31st to April 7th and was in room 421 Carisol side and traveled solo.  The resort is remote off a twisty road in the hills at least 50km outside of the city.  It's remote but you can get away without much difficulty if you are interested in going outside the resort area. There are horses, cows, goats, dogs and cats on the resort; all of whom roam freely.  At night the cows and goats are let out to graze and some of the horses also...didn't bother me none expect the occasional pile of poop.  Saw enormous frogs, a few bats and a few crabs but NO cockroaches!  First time i didn't have to run into one!  I stayed in the Carisol side which was fine but none of the facilities were open until my last day - so no pool, food, bar...nothing just the rooms.  That";4
We went to the Club Amigo Carisol and stayed in bungalow E4 on the Los Corales side.  We absolutely loved it there and wish I could have adopted the 2 dogs that sleep underneath that bungalow!!!  The older black one with the white stripe down the middle of her face was my personal favourite.  I tried not to name her so as not to get too attached, but failed miserably and ended up calling her Sweetie all week!  If you stay in that bungalow, please bring them food and water!  She is the most loving dog I’ve ever met and loves belly rubs and back scratches!  (the other one is very shy though).  Anyway… to the review!  Loved this resort.  Yes, there were issues – it is Cuba after all.  Food:	The buffet was mediocre, but there were always things to eat.  Always something at the grill;4
We spent a great fun filled week at the Corales section of the Club Amigo Carisol Corales hotel complex.  We’d been a little apprehensive due to some negative reviews, but were assured by a friend who is a repeat guest that it was a great place to spend a holiday and we’re very glad we went.    At the time we arrived, the Carisol part of the complex had closed for the “off” season, but actually partly re-opened during our stay, because Corales was full beyond capacity. We had a standard room, which was spacious, kept very clean, had comfortable beds and a really nice balcony.  The shower had good water pressure and hot water. Our maid was very polite, friendly and helpful.  We had a small issue with the safe in our room when we arrived and the matter was addressed very promptly;4
Club Amigo Los Carisol los Corales March 2013 Not a great place.   Before anyone shouts that it is only a three star what do you expect….we have gone to a three star in Holguin, and we did not have any problems. Pros Location of our room was wonderful Room 304 on the Corales side..Front door faced the pool and the terrace faced the Carribean Sea…. Although the maintenance could have been a lot better…Air conditioner good, but the face only held on by a screw and it rattled all night….water from the air conditioner just went on to the tiles on the terrace, very slippery…an accident waiting to happen. Rooms were quite clean, no full length mirror, I am short and had a hard time seeing in the bathroom mirror.  Beds okay…pillow dreadful, bring your own and leave them there. Great;2
We just got back on April 3, 2013.  We had a great time and the weather was perfect every day.  We had no bugs.  Their was lots to choose from in the buffet for breakfast and lunch and supper.  The staff was excellent.  We went on the excursion of the dolphins, highly recommend it.  $65 pesos per person.  I would recommend that the bars, give a speciality drink of the day or have a specialty menu at the bars.  We met so me great friends and hope to go back next year..I miss the puppies....;4
"My friend and I recently went to this resort staying on the Los Corales side in Mid March 2013 and we had an amazing time.  The people were so friendly and helpful and we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  We spent our mornings in the ocean, snorkeling, going out on a catamaran with Frank (who is super friendly), doing water aerobics with Yilan (who is incredibly helpful and fun) and spent our afternoons at the pool.  Both locations are quite beautiful and we were never at a loss of things to do; we tried salsa dancing, pool volley ball and Spanish lessons to name a few.  The entertainment staff is incredibly talented including the master of ceremonies, Julio, and the shows every night were super fun.  The bartenders always knew how to make a good drink and on most occasions, all the";4
Just back from 1 week at this hotel. We had no expectations as price was great. Always something to eat. Tried restaurant just outside of the gates for lobster pretty good! Brought many items to give staff & locals. Massages $20 CUC w/nurse Anna great. Nice people tourists & staff. Beach ok for snorkelling but bring water shoes.Did trip to Santiago bus broke down 1/2 hr into trip finally back to hotel & did it again next day. The fortress is awesome and saw many important places important to the Cuban people guide was very informative. Shows hit or miss. The pool was colder than the ocean so went there occasionally especially for 4:00 pm Bingo. 2 ala cartes Cuban & Seafood. Went to buffet after both! The real downside was dogs (many) and cats at the buffet. No problem w/bugs at;3
This was mine and my bfs first trip ever and we were soooo pleased, and I didn't think at times because of reading such horrible reviews on this site. First of all negative nancys it is 3 star, what were you expecting?? Second, there were NO FURRY SPIDERS, in fact we saw NO bugs or insects are entire week there..not even mosquitos down by the beach late night lol. The food was 3star food, sometimes it got cold but I guess we weren't there quick enough, you will never ever starve there that is certain. The staff were GREAT, as well as their families that visited on family day. I left a package every afternoon on my bed for the chambermaid, they are spoiled so I also gave items to the sweetest guy ever..the gardener, very old man and probably works the hardest, and also the;4
This was our 5th visit to Cuba. First in Santiago area. I will make this brief but add what I feel differs from what others have had to say of late. First we paid about $500 all in for a week of fun. Right there you are getting an amazing bargain. 1) Flight: We flew on CanJet, first rate. Nice hot meal, champagne and wine , a movie and very attentive staff. Very impressed.  And we were lucky that they were on time going down and coming back. 2)Beach: Kind of lacking in Beach, but this is normal for this part of Cuba. If a large beach with miles to walk is what you want, this is not the place for you. However the view looking towards Guantanamo Bay takes your breath away. Compared to what we know of other resorts in this part of Cuba, this beach is actually not bad. Sadly the;3
FOOD - mediocre or even less - husband caught a parasite of sorts - ended up in emerge one day after  our return home.  I was sick for a day and half while at the resort but less severe than my husband.  Food was mostly cold, rarely labelled so you had zero idea just what type of meat the dish was unless you were lucky enough to get the attn of a staff member and ask.  SERVICE - just okay.  Found there to be a lack of motivation to pleasantly care for the visitors of this resort.  Bar staff where generally slow and made you feel as if you were imposing on their time to serve you a drink.  Beach bar fella was wonderful, he was a breath of fresh air, that I do have too mention! ROOMS - once again just okay generally clean.  Sliding doors to balcony do not lock - a stick is placed;1
Food: everyone knows that the food in Cuba is not very good anywhere, it would be a great idea to bring some snacks from home like chips, chocolates, spices . etc. Keep away from the burgers and hot dogs at the snack bars, they are terrible and always under cooked.  In the buffet their is always some decent stuff you can eat like the white rice and meats they make at the grill. During lunch they have a pasta bar which is pretty good compared to everything else.  Rooms : The rooms were really clean and conftorable. The maids did not steal anything , their is also a safe for your valuables. Make sure not too lose the resorts towels or you will be charged 25cuban/$. the rooms on the bottom floor were much cooler then the upstairs rooms.   Weather : The weather is always extremely;4
We stayed in Los Corales for 2 weeks in February. Have been to Cuba 8 times before, we decided to bring our little one to this resort as his first vacation trip (we stayed there one year ago). Needless to say- we had a very enjoyable vacation with many good memories.  FOOD: As have been said before, don't expect too much, it is not a 4 or 5 star hotel, but the food is good. If you want to eat something extra- there is a restaurant right on the right side of the resort, they have lobsters and shrimps and fish (i think the dish is ~12-15$). There is also another one by the laguna, 5 km on the left. Being this time with a baby, I was reluctant to eat elsewhere but resort restaurant, so didnt try their food. However, if you walk through the security at the entrance and turn right;5
My husband and I have been to Cuba over 10 times, a little everywhere.  By now, we know what to expect and are usually pleased.  Apart from being very clean, this hotel offers JUST the basics.  For instance, we did not have any butter for the whole week we stayed there.  Because of hurricane Sandy, the beach and other amenities were damaged.  Nonetheless, if you don't expect much, this is a place to relax.  The food was very basic but very eadible.  I could have lived just on fresh bread and rice!  One down side though is there is dogs,cats and birds in the open dining area.  They walk around freely stopping from table to table in quest of anyone who is nice enough to give them food.  I adore animals, but not while I'm eating...  We took an excursion to visit several important;2
"My wife and I stayed at Carisol for three weeks in February (and it was our 5th time in the Santiago area). When hurricane Sandy wiped out the nearby (30km) Bucanero resort last October we were looking into alternative resorts. There was nothing at all anywhere which compared to the Santiago area of Cuba! Add to that the fact that Cubans are great hosts and very warm and friendly people it was so good to be able to stay 'just down the road'. If you are one who spends all their time dwelling on the negatives, please spend your dollars elsewhere. Cuba, and the Corales/Carisol resort is not perfect. But for the price you pay, it is like heaven for the vast majority who stay there. For us, the ocean nor the pools are the big attraction; we use the pool about 5 times a week . The";4
"My wife and I just returned from a sunny week in the south of Cuba.  The resort was recovering from the effects of the fall's hurricane and the destruction it had rendered was still very evident throughout the area.  As ever, the staff in Cuban resorts were extremely friendly and considerate.  I really appreciated the dive guides and boat captain who made extra special trips available.  The design and access to services was fine.  The beach, the setting, and the pleasant  staff make this overall a fine place to stay especially for the price.  I did have two concerns: Hola Sun offered a ""special"" wherein there was to be a boat trip to the small port of Siboney with national drink and time on Siboney Beach . I had been there before and was looking forward to this excursion. This";3
Just got back from the Club Amigo Colares. Stayed March 10th  to March 17th. on the Corales sde. They shut down the Carisol side for the season.  travelled with 3 adults 50+ yrs and 1 ten yr  old.   We have been to the Riu in Ocho Rios, St. Lucia Coconut Bay, Cozumel-Allegro!  Barbados in dec 2012 and many times to Punta Cana 4 & 5 starts and Varadero 2x.   Please rememer this is CUBA so set you expectations accordingly.  I will be objective in my review.    Check IN:   Slow as there was only 2 people checking you in.  We had drinks to chill with so no bother to us.   Bars:  On average, the service was ok.  NO one rushed to serve you, to put it that way.But you wont go thirsty.   Julia at the swim up bar is a sweetheart.  A tip each day goes a long way!!!!  Servesa is;3
"There are a wide range of reviews on this resort - so I would like to add my opinion, just remember that this review and all others are just that, opinions. Also remember that you are traveling to Cuba and the food will not be to North American standards (I reccomend bringing a bottle of Frank's Hot Sauce).  Personally I have been to Cuba four times, The Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, Most of North America, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, North Africa and Fiji. I have stayed everywhere from a Cave in Greece to a Castle in N.Z. and I have to say  that ""I love Cuba"", the music, people, country and weather are all fantastico! One of my traveling companions and his wife have been to Cuba 33 times and they too love Los Corales!  So if you adjust your expectations you can't help";4
We read the reviews before we went so we were not sure what to expect.  As they say don't believe everything that you read.  Some must have an axe to grind so they write a bad review ...  Here is the true review of our trip ...  Our experience was very good.  If you set your expectations appropriately, remember you are going to Cuba in a 3 star hotel. Don't expect the same North American standards.  The bus ride to the hotel was less than an hour and our tour guide provided us with lots of info along the way.  BTW pay the $5 Canadian for the 3 ice cold beers if available ... (our bus driver was selling from a cooler).  Got money exchanged at airport but we also exchanged more at front desk (Los Corales side - where we stayed was much more convenient).  Check in was a breeze and;4
Couple mid 40s... We really enjoyed our trip, Staff is very pleasant.  We went to Santiago in taxi, we offered the driver to pay his meal if he stays with us and we hand up with a private guide,  Thank you Roddy...it was hot and a lot easier to visit around.  We even went to El Morro ``Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca``.  We bought lots of souvenirs, many vendors before entering the castle, at least half the price than at the hotel, may be because they were closing soon.  We tried both restaurants a la carte and prefered The Cuban at Corales.  The pizzaria was better at Carisol but the wait was long.  Even if the site is not as pretty at Carisol, the pool was always spic and span (better than Corales) and the service was very good.  I really enjoyed  the fact that it was two;4
Travelled with 3 friends to Los Amigo Carisol/Corales from Feb 27- March6 for 625 all in.  Have been to Cuba 7 times before and stayed at all different hotels, different cities. This was one of the best! We ae all in our 40s and 50s and are low maintainence travellers, but not pushovers either. Flew with Sunwing on a Champagne Flight from Toronto, flight was great. Landed in Santiago, small airport but very efficent. 45 minute very comfortable bus ride to hotel-we were on the Carisol side (Stay at 1, play @ both). Check in was quick and friendly. We stayed in the 500 block- room was spacious, clean and centrally located. Read alot about huge spiders and since we travelled with an arachnaphobe it was a concern. Brought spider spray, sprayed windows and doors daily- never saw a;4
Very pleasant staff, we enjoyed every day.  Made many friends, people on vacation and with the staff.  My only concern is that the hotel was short on staff.  The waiters had to serve many tables at the same time, they tried very hard to make everyone happy.  I thank everyone for a nice vacation, our maid, our security guards, our ground keeper..;4
"Here are a few tips: * There is a shortage of pens, so bring LOTS to give. Also, bring a flashlight, it is very dark walking at night around resort.  Excursions with resort: There is a Jeep excursion through the mountains, that one was supposedly the best of all ($43 per person).  I did the Santiago tour for a day with the resort ($35 per person); you stop and see different places in the city. Definitely worth while seeing the city. There were lots of beggars, people offering to buy cigars... Bring soap and pens to bring, those are worth more than money to them.They also like hats and reusable water bottles.  Food on resort: It's Cuba, so you know what to expect. Breakfast: there's great omelets, fruit and cereal. Lunch: I always went to pizza, pasta restau on los corales side.";4
CARISOL LOS CORALES. February 20-27 2013.  WHO WE ARE. Married couple – 70+ years old. Joe and Karen.  CARISOL LOS CORALES HOTEL. There are two separate all-inclusive hotels here, the Carisol and the Corales. If you stay at either, you can consume at both properties. This would be our second visit to this three-star property. On our November 2012 visit, right in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, we were assigned to the Carisol side as the Corales section was closed because of wind damage. This time we were assigned to the Corales hotel side which we are now reviewing. This was exactly what we hoped would happen as it would give us a chance to see what both properties had to offer. The Corales side, just like the Carisol side, is a very nice, quiet, laid-back, no-frills property,;3
Carisol Los Corales : Typical 3 Star & Beginner Snorkelling Only   I stayed one week at this 2 hotel complex from feb 13th to feb 20th 2013. It is a standard typical hotel complex with some hits and some misses like most of the other six  2 to 3 star hotels I’ve been to in Cuba in the last years. It is located 1 hr by bus from the Santiago airport in the Bocanao provincial park. There is an aquarium, a dinosaur park (cement reproductions) and an antique car museum that can be visited in the park. Facing the sea, the complex to your right is Carisol and the one to your left is Los Corales. Rooms are usually given for people who stay more than one week at Los Corales. Both complexes are fairly similar. Los Corales has the tennis courts but I never saw anyone using them. The pool;3
I've been to Cuba twice (this being my second time).  I stayed at the Los Corales side from Feb 13-20/13.  This resort was fine on initial arrival.  The facilities were fine, and the pool was wonderful - loved the swim-up bar.  Clean-up of the beach areas is continuing, as Hurricane Sandy did quite a number on the oceanfront.  You NEED watershoes if you want to swim in the ocean due to fire coral being washed in, and sea urchins.  The resort store doesn't sell these, so bring them with you.  The biggest problem with this resort was the staff.  Some were excellent (Yohanna at the lobby bar on Los Corales side, Milka and Terry - waiters in the pasta restaurant - and Video - the pool bar bartender) and very attentive to our needs.  Most others were neglectful and ignored us.  I had;2
"We are in our early 40s, and stayed Feb 20-27.  This was my fourth trip to Cuba, so I had realistic expectations when choosing a budget-friendly 3 star resort.  However, this was my first time to Santiago.  The arrival at the airport was nowhere near as efficient as Varadero.  Only one money exchange wicket was open, and Cubans work at their own (very slow) pace.  Once we were finally on the bus, the bumpy drive to the resort took about 50 minutes.    Arrival at the Los Corales side of the resort resulted in lobby chaos as the entire bus and luggage crowded in, with only 2 front desk staff to check everybody in.  The welcome cocktail was greatly appreciated; have a seat and wait for the crowds to settle.  Your room was already pre-assigned, so being the last to check in doesn’t";3
This was my 3rd trip to Cuba. We stayed at the Bucanero last time but unfortunately that was no longer an option so we were sent here instead. I was unsure about this resort having read about tarantulas, animal cruelty, crappy food etc.  Well, I can honestly say that if you relax and understand what you're getting into, you can really enjoy your stay at Carisol / Los Corales. We stayed at the Carisol side. Nice upstairs room overlooking the pool. High ceilings and clean. Excellent water pressure, and working A/C. The beds are FIRM, with a thin mattress. I have an old back injury and I believe this is actually much better for sleeping on than a saggy mattress. In fact, I was in the middle of a bad back episode when I arrived and slept fine! There is also a great lady who gives;4
I stayed with friends on the Carisol side Feb 17-24th out of Toronto.I had a very open mind when travelling to Cuba with friends as they had all been before so I was prepared.    What I was not prepared for was watching dirty utensils being removed from tables, put in a container of dirty water with 50 other pieces of used cutlery, with no soap, removed, wiped off and put back in the 'clean' tray to be used again.  Or for plates to be wiped 'clean' and put back on tables.  I witnessed this with my own eyes as did the rest of my party.  We used plastic the rest of the week.  The food was as expected but repeats every day so by the end of the week I was pretty tired of it.  If you see it at breakfast, you'll see it at lunch and again at dinner.  Bring your own ketchup and spices.;2
We travelled for a week Feb 17-24. I would like everyone going to this resort to remember that Cuba is a developing country, and does not have the same luxuries as Canada. We stayed on the Los Corales side, but used the facilites of both resorts.  Room: Three of us stayed in one room, and room was big enough that there was enough room with two beds pushed together. Air conditioner was loud, but worked great. 110 volt in the bathroom, so we did not need to use our adapter. Room was cleaned every day by our chambermaid Mandoella every day by 11.  Food: Pizza and pasta station available on both Carisol and Los Corales, and they were both equally good. The buffet on the Carisol side seemed to have more options at dinner time, there was always spaghetti available there but not on the;5
"Firstly, I must comment on the staff and Cuban people in general; They are very kind, accommodating and pleasant. No complaints about any of them. The rooms were definitely adequate, but without sounding too whiney, it would have been nice if our toilet worked properly, our patio door was closable, and couple of other small issues. The pools were great, bars great. Beach.....not so much. We enjoy the ocean, like to swim and were awed by the beaches of Varadero earlier.  I'm not sure if the shore line at this end of the island has been altered greatly since Hurricane Sandy or what, but there is no real place to swim out at this resort. Very shallow, and rocky, and difficult to wade in or swim. However, beach had plenty of loungers and was clean. The biggest issue at this resort";3
Its was a great place.  It might not have the most up to date rooms.  But they are clean, comfortable,  and more then what you need.  The pools were awsome, the food was tasty,  the people were increadable.  You can snorkle right off the beach.  I would suggest that you not take the boat off the beach to snorkel.;4
Returned from a two week stay, February 3 - 17 out of Toronto. This was my fourth visit to the same resort at the same time each year. Although there is always room for improvement, the improvements already made were wonderful. I travel with a large group each year and always find we have a good time. For those that have yet to travel to Cuba, just know that they do the best with what they have to offer. I came home with a sun burn, bug bites, scrapes, bruises, slight tummy trouble and the biggest smile on my face:)! The staff are fantastic! If you come with a smile on your face and an open mind, they are more than happy to offer superb service. This is not a 5 star resort, nor is it a 5 star price. Sometimes you have to help yourself and even help others. Your vacation is what;4
I wish you people stop complaining about small things, you go out in Toronto with your family you spend 500 dollars and you tip with no complains or questions, people here do their best to make our stay is pleasant, and don't forget this is an area that was hit 3 month ago, these people did their best to fix what they can, if you guys have an issue you should complain to the americans for doing what their doing to cuba. carisol amazing staff, they can help as much as they can, JULIA in reception thank you from the bottom of our heart myself and my friend for helping with the rooms, DAMARES thank you for the best cofe and service, CHINO your great ELYASER you made our food the best, and many more of the staff that made this week a memorable week. not first time this was our 3d;5
Overall the 2 resorts were ok for 3 star rating. Stayed at Los Corales side Feb 10 - 17. The grounds were very nicely done, lots of flowering trees. Many new plants just  planted.     The pool was very nice, spent most of our time there because the beach was not the best. It still had a lot of coral and rocks, but they were always working on removing them by hand. If they just used a tractor and rake it would be done faster. The Ocean was warm and clean, but to much sea grass and rocks. Water shoes needed here. Snorkling was great.     We took the free boat excursion, nothing like it was discribed. The boat took us out in front of the Dophin Aquarium, droped off some divers, then went a bit further and dropped us off for snorkling for 30 minutes. That was it, no drinks, not trip;3
DISCLAIMER # 1 - This is not a 5 star hotel.  The residents are mostly older folks.  If you are looking for a restful vacation, this is the place. If you are looking to party, book somewhere else  DISCLAIMER # 2 - Attend your orientation session, it's very informative  DISCLAIMER # 3 - If you are a beach lover, you will be thoroughly disappointed.  There is only a very small portion of the ocean that is free of weeds/rocks.  Bring water shoes  DISCLAIMER # 4 - Bring your own beach towel(s), or you will be waiting on the maid to get your towels which will be between 9:00 - 10:00am  DISCLAIMER # 5 - Take your pillow with you if you have sleeping issues  DISCLAIMER # 6 - Take your portable coffe mug/water jug/bottle  ROOMS: Adequate, spacious, need some repairs, but you are only;4
I went to Los Corales Jan 13 with my two sisters (ages 17-29).  We got a great deal on the trip - $550 all in for a week from Toronto.  It's hard to complain when you pay those prices!  The Good: - the room was in good shape - we stayed in the 500s, it could be a little noisy if you wanted to nap in the afternoon but the air conditioner drowned out the sound nicely! - also the shower was fabulous - always hot and always great pressure - The management: Merlades in the front Lobby (blonde hair) is super sweet and accomodating.  Alejandro at the check in is wonderful.  Ovideo at the pool bar was also great - the pool: had floaty things, a shallow area and always a ton of chairs, no getting  up at 6am to reserve one required! - the beach - no, it's not Varadero, you want white;3
Up front I have to say that we were Bucanero devotees, and sadly had to relocate here after the Bucanero was totally destroyed by Sandy.  The Bucanero was a very special place for us and we were initially reluctant, but I am happy to say that in many ways this place runs a close second. Also, we encountered many of the same great Bucanero people working here now.  It is a friendly, relaxed place and a great deal for the price.  Don't come here if you are a 5 star snob who is ready to write bad reviews about a place if the electricity goes out for a couple of minutes, or you see a big fuzzy spider. This is not 5 star but it's well run, clean and comfortable and the weather is guaranteed perfect. BTW, the big fuzzy spiders are not tarantulas as some suggest, and they are harmless.;4
I stayed at this hotel from Jan 30 - Feb 13,2013. I thought that the grounds around the resort were Ok.pool was OK. The food was the worst that I have ever had in any Cuban resort, I would like the management of this hotel too at least have name tags on the food so the hotel guests know what they are consuming.;3
Honestly... Stay AWAY from this place! They don't wash the dishes with soap, just wipe with a dirty towel! I cought them in action!!! I can't believe my wife and I spent a week there... It's like sharing the same spoon with 250 other guests! I don't think anyone would be ok with this... I also got served a chicken bone under my pizza one time (they didnt clean the plate after someone had chicken before me!!! the pizza also takes over an hour before you get it... Wow... If it was clean at least, but it's not... Manager is also useless... After complaining he didn't even discipline the waiters... Towels were stained and nasty. Tarantullas everywhere... Real ones! Only 2 scooters available for 2 hotels (500 customers I believe). S_e_x trafficing obvious at the resort... Not a place;1
My husband and I visited this resort for the first time Feb. 1-8th. We are in our 50's. We have travelled extensively including all-inclusive resorts (always a 4-star or better), cruises and escorted tours in Europe. This is our second visit to Cuba, we went to Cayo Coco in 1998. We stayed on the Carisol side, Block 400, top floor. After reading the reviews I felt a little apprehensive about booking it but we found such a great deal, I thought let's take a chance. If nothing else it will be an adventure and we'll get away from winter for a week. The weather was amazing! It was sunny and hot every day. It rained for about 10 minutes the whole week we were there. Not too windy just pleasant ocean breezes. We loved the fact that everything except for our accommodations is open-air.;3
We stayed in the 200 block of Carisol and it was great. However, we were relocated from Bucanero due to its closure and requested Los Corales and the request was not honored. We weren't impressed but, in the end, it didn't matter.  The room was great. Apart from missing out on the ocean view of the Bucanero, it was perfect. The water was hot, the a/c worked and so did the fridge. One of the beds was kind of hard, but we just slept in the better one. The room was so cool, we kept adding blankets, which our maid added when she made the bed.  We had an amazing time. Our only complaints would be the mediocre buffet options. But we always found something to eat. The omelets at breakfast were great, the pizza and pasta at dinner were good, and the bread was AMAZING! We pretty much ate;4
We were at the Carisol side from Jan 27 till Feb 4. We were a gruop of 5. Good or bad first, let's start with the good. Resort is well kept, staff are generally freindly, bartenders were great, so was the maid. We had an issue with no hot water first day and it was taken care of the same day, unfortunely we keep running out.  Now the bad.  Food- Not labbled, hot food was cold and cold hot. Major cross-contamination going on. Raw fish and pork cooking onthe same grill with the same untensils. Next morining same grill is used to cook bacon and eggs. Bacon always raw, eggs undercooked depending on cook. Only one grill for cooking all the meat-breaskfast-luch and supper. Last moring the server took our dirty forks and knives and I witnessed her just wipe them and place them in with;1
"This hotel labels itself as ""Carisol Los Corales"" in its title, however they are in fact two separate hotels.  When we booked we did not realize this, and subsequently the bus dropped us off in the Carisol lobby of the dual resort, and so by default we signed in at the Carisol front desk, and were therefore placed in the Carisol part of the resort.  It wasn't until we tried to attend the Sunwing meeting the next morning and were subsequently told by a fellow tourist that we were in the wrong lobby (which we were told on the bus the previous day was the correct lobby) that we discovered there was another resort.  Los Corales was a much nicer hotel.  Nicer rooms, pools, eating areas and stage area.      We asked at the front desk why we weren't told to go to the other resort by";3
Keep in mind this is not a five star resort. We knew this before we left, so I wasn't expecting much. I was surprised. Brand new expresso machine at the pool bar on the carisol side. new balcony chairs and table, newer flat screen tvs, and new air conditioners going in here and there. So our bedspread didnt match our curtains and there wasnt fancy wall decor, but it was sleepable and spotlessly clean.Our bedspeads where taken for washing and replaced on the same day. And they where for single beds not doubles, but it didnt matter. We have been to 5 stars that are not as clean .The beds are NOT pillow tops but not sway backs either. But sleepable.   Food was good they even had ketchup and mustard. Homemade pizza and spagetti.  Bathrooms are all tiled with a huge walk in shower;4
Just returned from Carisol side of the hotel.    First - things you need to know - Try to find out before you leave whether you are on the Carisol or Los Corales side.  This was a frustration and confusion when we arrived because no-one had been told in advance and the hotel didn't seem to know how to cope.  We were simply told to wait so we checked with the tour guide and he said to get back in the bus because we were probably at the other side. - Money: change it as soon as you can because the hotel doesn't always have any. - Our tour guide (Hola Sun) told us that because they are located within a national park, we would have to pay cash for excursions because they did not have reliable internet service. - Water shoes are a necessity not an option because of the coral and;2
Weather was great and the sea water was warm. My wife enjoyed snorkelling right off the beach but the beachfront is very rough and water shoes are a must. If you enjoy walking the beach this is not the place to go. The price was right but you get what you pay for. This was our third time in Cuba and had this been our first it would have been our last. Our room was fine, air conditioner worked great and we always had plenty of hot and cold water at all times.  The biggest frustration was the meals. The food selection was very limited and repetitive. They frequently ran out of bread at breakfast, scarce dessert at lunch and dinner and the coffee machine broke frequently. It was hard to get cups for the coffee when the machine was working and they were always running out of glasses;2
I went with my mom for our first time to cuba and had the best time ever ! we stayed on the Carisol side of resort its a little older looking then the other side don't let that fool you it was great! we stayed in the 400 block upstairs it a perfect location its close to beach and pool our maid was great if you go say hi to Yamila for me we had flowers on our pillow everyday. we left gifts everyday in room last day we left 20pasos each . the food sucked but that's the normal in cuba the pizza was good . pool bar was fantastic they make the best drinks Tony is the best . the waitresses and waiters are all very nice we tiped 1 paso there is a very nice waitress Gracia every time we went when she was on we were greeted with a hug and kiss and she was very good to my mom there was;4
This was our 1st time at Club Amigo Carisol but our 12th time to Cuba. It is a beautiful resort with very clean large rooms. The food is typically cuban - a little bland but there is always a lot to eat. The staff is very friendly and courteous - of course tipping does help a bit. We were in the 200 block upstairs and it was very quiet but a bit of walking. Watch out for cracked/loose floor tiles on the stairs. We did meet a couple of big black hairy spiders but not in our rooms.  The room safe was free. The trip to the Tropicana was well worth the price. The power outages were few and short. The resort was well worth the money.;4
"First time in Cuba and after reading the bad reviews we were a little worry, but we do not regret we took that last minute deal of $512/person all inclusive; for a 3 stars resort is was amazing, it could be 4 or 4.5 very easy.  First of all rooms are underrated, we were in a 4.5stars resort in Dominican last year and room was not to much different, but food was more diverse in Dominican; so food is good and enough; people very nice, but you mast have change in $1 to tip them all if you can, because they are really poor, only $10/month income; the setting of the resort is fantastic surrounded by mountains and the water is crystal clear , but you need water shoes because the sand of the shore is not so fine; the only complain would be about a couple of dogs waiting for food at";4
Well,I don't  know how to start.The beauty and the beast kind of story.We got home last night, perfect wheather , resort very  clean, you don't  have to pay for your  safety box extra, it was included , no spiders  in our room but we heard story's ,we got the super saver room witch is the same size room with the regular room, we just got a extra bed in our room,but. I didn't care ,we didn't go there to spend our time inside the room. Very safe,staff kind of like alcohol ,but don't we all!! Ha-ha  .Now to the  beast story,no bread for breakfast , I wouldn't  say food was bad ,because there was no food ,and we are no piki people ,and  the night before we left ,there  was no power from 8.30 pm til 10.am,imagine by 30@C ,we didn't like it ,but we managed , very bad  for the young;3
I stayed at this resort from Jan 2-9. There were 10 of us in my group. We got there around lunch time and check in went good. Rooms are clean but very dated. Bed was not comfortable at all, another review mentioned going to bed drunk that may have been a good idea. Weather was wonderful no rain or clouds my whole stay. In our block of rooms we had a Taranchula Spider problem. Never in all my travels have I ever seen this before. All through the hallways ceiling and floors. We tried and asked the secuirty if they bite or poision and they really had no idea what we were talking about. The front desk finally told us they don't bit. I have a hard time believing that something that size doesn't do anything. I always tried to keep my door closed at all time for fear one would get in.;3
We went to the resort from Jan 6 till the 13. It rained for 10 minutes the whole week we were there! It was hot hot hot! Flew direct from toronto and was at the resort within an hour and change of being there. We were greeted with a snack, some drinks and some live music! The rooms are large and have sliding door out. The rooms arent in perfect condition, but the showers blast you! The beds are pretty stiff...... go to bed drunk..... The staff there make the place what it is. The maids leave you a towel everyday that is twisted and folded into things, like swan hearts! the bartenders remember you and always seem happy to see you. Actually, everyone seemed happy to be working there! The event planners, Holla at Julio, got things going! From beach volleyball to the coconut toss to;4
We are loyal Bucanero fans who booked their 3 weeks winter vacation (for December 19 to January 9) since June, so we got relocated to Carisol Corales like many others (for those not familiar with the situation, hurricane Sandy completely destroyed Bucanero, so going there was no longer an option). We were reluctant at the beginning, as we did not know if we would like it and three weeks would be a long time to be in a place we may not enjoy. While seriously considering getting a refund from Sunwing we learned that most of the staff from Bucanero is working at Carisol and that was what tipped the scales in favour of going.   While Bucanero was our Shangri-La and as far as we are concerned there is no other place like it, I will rate Carisol Corales objectively.  Please keep in;5
"Ok how to start this, we were relocated as well. When we arrived the hotel was full. They try to relocate us at the ""sister"" hotel (I had 2 rooms book with Sunwings). That did not work, they sent us back to Carisol. I kept my cool and smile, after one sleepless night in a ""stock room"" wondering ""what the heck"" they offer us a suite. Okay not bad, but I have 2 kids (teen and a 7rs) I REALLY WANTED my 2 rooms. The suite are great (NOT PERFECT) but very spacious and away from the action, sea front. But the are ""open space/split level"" so in a way, every body are living in the same area. We had a king bed with 2 good pillows, my 7 yrs slept with us and my teen in the 3/4 bed. Air condition, water pressure/temp perfect. No hair blower in my suite but lots of toilet paper. Please note";3
Here’s the scoop of our fabulous two weeks at Carisol: Dec 26–Jan 9…  Like so many prospective Bucanaro fans, we were relocated from Bucanaro to Los Corales/Carisol –we stayed on the Carisol section.  Los Corales/Carisol is located on the southeast side of Cuba, approximately 50 minutes away from the city of Santiago de Cuba.  As previously mentioned, we had another fabulous two weeks in Cuba. The weather was unusually warm this time of the year -to swim, snorkel, dive and relax in the sun.  The temperature ranged between 28 - 34C during the day and 25 - 28C at night.  As was the case at the Bucanaro and Los Corales resorts, Carisol is clean and pleasant -the staff are hospitable and friendly.  Due to the unfortunate disastrous storm at the Bucanaro, leaving staff jobless, it;5
We booked this resort for January 2-January 9th 2013 for a great price and set our expectations accordingly.   We arrived at the airport and our luggage was already waiting for us once we cleared security. The bus was there right away and we were at the resort within the hour. The trip is somewhat long but the views are totally worth it. Mountains on one side, the coast on the other and you even get to drive through some smaller communities. A tip: the ride can be bumpy and winding so if you get carsick easily you may want to take a Gravol.  Upon arriving the hotel there was a complimentary drink (virgin or not) and musicians playing instruments. We stayed in the Carisol section of the hotel. Check in was quick and easy and before we knew it we were on our way to our room.  Our;4
"Last year, for Christmas time, we went for the first time to Santiago de Cuba. We were supposed to go with the kids to Orlando, Florida as we usually did. Kids at first were not too thrilled wih this new idea but after our week in Cuba, when we got on the plane they said ""forget about Disney next year, we're coming back here!"".  We met a couple of people, Cubains you can only fall in love with. The resort was so great! Our rooms were great, clean, enough hot water... Absolutely no complaints! We loved it so much that we're going back again. Can't wait to be there!!!  The day of our horse back riding, we met Abel, a very nice guy, promising him we'd be back the next year. We're now leaving in 2 weeks and we're now wondering how he's doing since there is no way to contact him.";5
CLUB AMIGO CARISOL — November 19-26 2012 — Joe and Karen.  OUR ARRIVAL AT SANTIAGO. As we were some of the first international guests arriving after Hurricane Sandy, on exit from the terminal, we were greeted by a Cuban band, exotically dressed dancing girls, a variety of rum cocktails and lots of other hoopla, a relative beehive of activity it was. All this extravaganza with those beautiful Sierra Maestra mountains as a backdrop, was a really pleasant and heartwarming experience and we truly felt welcomed and we appreciated this very genuine greeting by the Cuban tour operators. They were sure glad to see us and we were equally glad to see them. From the airport to the hotel, (about an hours ride) we seen firsthand the physical destruction of hurricane Sandy. We were happy to;4
My girlfriend and I stayed here March.  This was our second time to Cuba, so we knew what to expect as far as food etc .  The resort is laid out nicely, but it's a fair walk to the beach, which is nice, but couldn't believe the garbage along the way.  We even started picking it up, hoping to start a trend with the staff, lol!  There is a another section to this resort that has been closed down and is just left to rot, such a shame.  We didn't expect much especially for the price, but I wouldn't recommend this place due to the staff.  There are a few good people, but most are rude, inconsiderate and just don't seem to give a crap.  One dinner we arrived at the buffet and couldn't find a clean table.  There were many tables available, but they had not been cleared off from the;2
I have been to the resort twice, once in Nov. 2011 and April 2012 and both times had a great time. The staff are friendly and very helpful, the rooms are nice and if you don't mind the music at night during the show you will like the 500 block. The food may not be the greatest but you will find something to eat. The Pool is great and the pool bar you can swim up to and have a drink, the beach is nice but lots of seaweed so just go down a little and go to the public beach and it is nice. Be sure to go on some of the day trips it is well worth it, swim with the dolphins omg was awesome, Jeep Safari was pretty cool, catamaran trip was really nice got to go snorkeling and a short tour of the city, now the City Tour was great went to an old cemetery and got to see the changing of the;4
"We spent two weeks there last March, the absolute worst place. Sent a letter to Sunwing and didn't even get a reply to date (five months). Just unbelievable! We have had better vacations at two star rated hotels and lobster at the buffet to boot!! In Cuba!! Thirty years plus now going there. Just to mention a couple of things, the pork chops at the buffet just had the bone, the meat was removed. The buffet restaurant I called ""The Aviary"" as birds were allowed to nest there and fly in and out (no windows) was the grossest, the bird poop was dripping on the walls, backs of and, seat of chairs, tables, and yes, I accidentally wiped my hand on some of it at the buffet table. Nothing was cleaned that I noticed. The staff was not bothered. The capitana actually told me that it was";1
this resort is sparkling place is so clean if you drop any food on the floor you can pick it up and eat it. beutiful beach close to the laguna, and the rooms with balcony face to the ocian sea very quiet almost 5 bars good food hotel face east and south sunny beach hot water nice pool and ranchero by the beach beutiful entertainment with young dancers and more.;3
First off, I have travelled with my girlfriend to Cuba for the past 8 years which has included a total of 10 trips, almost all of those have been 2-3 star properties, so I know what to expect from Cuba. This place disappointed on every level.  The location in the national park is very nice with a massive beach, unfortunately only a very small part is swimmable – rocks, urchins, etc. The animals are cool and are never a nuisance. The food is the worst I have ever had, the staff was (for the most part) bothered to even say hello let alone if you have a question. We love to travel in Cuba, staying on the resort for 7 days is not our thing. We went to book a scooter to drive to the city the Monday morning after we arrived, we were told we could have one on Thursday, we went on;2
My friend and I (27 & 29) stayed at this hotel in February 2012, we were looking for a comfortable resort to spend 7 days to relax and do some fun excursions.  Trust me when I saw we read reviews that went back and forth on being good and bad, if you want to feel safe and clean - this is not the place for you!  Our first room, had mold and holes in the wall, it smelled of sewage and the sheets and curtains were all stained.  We asked to be moved - we carted our luggage around all night till they found us another room - which had an adjoining room, with a small unsafe slide lock - our main door did not lock and there was no safe.  This hotel says it has many things but when you get there, not so much - the a la carte dinners were gross.  The only one good thing about this place;1
We arrived May14th with holasun.  First time in cuba.  Told in advance by tripadvisor people who frequent this resort that it would be closed and we would be bumped to another resort.  I emailed the manager of the CACC and he confirmed they were closing the beginning of May.  What a surprize when at the airport the holasun rep. piled us into a bus going to the CACC.  There was a total of 34 people at the resort.  It was for the most part closed-down.  We all were in a building facing the entertainment stage....noisy. noisy.. and when asked to move it was not possible. The bars had no supplies, the restaurant were closed except for the buffet.  The food was cold, limited and surrounded by flies and birds.............not very appealing!  We ate while being surrounded and watched;1
The best and worst thing about this resort was that there was only 25 guest there when we were staying as it was only 2 weeks before they closed for the summer.  The fact it was empty meant that we got the beach to ourselves and effectively had a private bar man to get us nicely drunk. However, this also meant that the burger bar was only open for about 1 hour a day, and the restaurant was closed entirely. This left us to get food from the buffet which was rather poor.  The pool was very nice, plus it had a bar in it.  the room was ok, the AC was very noisy and the safe didn't work. Having said all this we had an excellent relaxing stay here;4
So happy to be every year in this Hotel. Thanks again to all the people in the Hotel who works for, for a great time there.  You always do and try the best to spend a great time there, even its verry difficult with some really really difficult and stupid guests. Many people forget that they are in a communistic country. For that they are not fair and sometimes unfriendly with the Managment in the Hotel for exampel some people went to the desk and said that they are affraid about all the dogs and cats in the hotel. What happen, all cats and dogs where catched and killed. Thanks to this stupid ones who where affraid about really really nice and friendly animals The dogs and cats are more friendly than some of the guests But now to my trip. I spend 6 weeks in the hotel and it was;4
I stayed at this resort Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales and would say it is your average 3 star resort. I found the staff was very friendly and helpful at all times, the place was in good condition and was clean. I've been to Cuba before and I know what to expect, the food was ok not the greatest but I knew that before traveling. The beach was nice but a little bit too much coral, the weather was perfect for my whole trip. There was entertainment every night if not at our resort (Amigo Side) then the other resort (Carisol side). There was some damage done to the buildings on the Carisol side but that was because of the Hurricane that swept through that part of the country not long ago, so it was to be expected. My experience there was good and as long as you know what to expect;3
Greetings. Returned recently (last Week) from Santiago de Cuba. First time I actually returned 2 years back to back to the same resort, this should tell the story one, what I had for a vacation Last year. The precise day I left last year, a new Manager was taking over the Resort. This can be good, or bad. Unfortunately this was not a good thing. Managerial experience was poor, at best. Several small maintenance things that in the end added up to a rather large plate full. No water, no power for 2 days, they had been out for 3 days in a row (water) in total, so I should consider myself fortunate in that department I guess. Room not ready upon arrival, a/c not on, Fridge m/t and not plugged in, Toilet paper rack m/t and torn off wall on floor, Showerhead torn off wall and on;2
We traveled Sunwing Jan 18th, and arrived at The Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales at about noon for a two week stay. Getting through customs, picking up the luggage and getting on the bus was uneventful, which is how you want it. The scenic ride from the airport to the hotel took about an hour. The Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales are two resorts operating as one. You have access to the facilities on both sides but they have their own separate check in and front desks.  As we were traveling with another couple we were surprised to find our friends were booked into the Carisol side while we were on the Los Corales side.  While the walk between the two sides is only at most 5 minutes, we had requested (and of course preferred) that we both be in the same hotel, with a preference being;3
"Myself and 3 other girls (all of us being university students) have just returned from a week vacation at Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales (CACC). We stayed at the resort from April 25th to May 2nd. As University students we were looking for a good deal and I won’t deny that we didn’t pay a whole lot for the vacation, however, we were fairly disappointed with this resort.   I refer to myself as a well-seasoned traveler as this is my 7th time to Cuba, and the CACC was by far the worst resort I have stayed at in Cuba. Each time we travel to Cuba (or anywhere), we keep in mind that the trip is what you make it, and that you can’t expect 5 stars from a 3 star Cuban resort. We did make the trip a fantastic one; however our fantastic trip had nothing to do with the resort (which merits";2
I just went to the Club Amigo in Holguin 5 weeks prior, and the main difference is that this resort was much smaller. That being said, it is a well-maintained resort with amazing staff. I recommend bringing clothes, shoes, perfume, and toiletries instead of tipping with money. The food is repetitive but good enough considering I don't expect much from the food in Cuba. They did run out of beer for a couple hours a few times but it wasn't a big deal. I never experienced power outages or loss of hot water as other reviewers had mentioned. The trip is what you make of it and you just have to roll with the flow. I just went to party and have a good time. Don't expect to pay a really cheap price and not expect a few inconveniences. The pool bar staff are amazing! I would consider;5
It was a wonderful 2 week vacation. The sea and the views of the mountains were amazing. Rooms are clean. Food is good, while quite simple. I rented a bicycle and went outside for a ride before sunset, it was so nice! There is a beautiful Lagoon in 10 min ride. One also can get a massage for $10 on site. The water interruption did not spoil the vacation that much. All people who work there are nice and friendly. Neo, the sales manager, is friendly and attentative, while giving efficient service. Nice vacation, overall. Good for money;4
My wife and I were at this resort from Apr 8 - 15 and had the best vacation of our lives. Our room was great our maid was excellent, the pool was great and it was hot. We only had rain for maybe 1/2hour one day out of the whole week. Like everybody says the food is not the greatest but you can always find something to eat from hot dogs and hambugers at the beach restaurant to lobster if you meet the right people(Milko at the beach rest). We did not go on any tours but we did rent scooters a couple of times and that was the best part of the trip.We experienced the Cuban culture in a very different way then you would on a tour. We stopped to look at a school and was invited inside to see it. We drove about 15 minutes towards Santiago and found a public beach where we were treated;4
I stayed at this resort with my husband and 4 children. The mountains were beautiful, the staff was amazing! Everyone had a great time. I for one am not use to this type of resort. No hydro for days, only one hot shower all week. I could handle a cold shower but there were days when there was no water at all. Smelly!! I had hundred of little red aunts in my bathroom sink. Nice cool pool water and always great service made up for it. None of the other family members had complaints just mom. Location for games room and restaurant was good. I could see the kids wherever they went. Kids enjoyed the piano and pool table in the games room. Unfortunately some lovely French people who chose to sit in the games room complained about the noise :-(. Piano was removed the next day. Then;4
The resort was amazing. Very small which I enjoy , great service ! Beautiful beach very rough make sure to have water shoes. Rooms werent the best but remember you are only really in there to sleep. I have no complaints besides that there was a lot of annoying people complaining about everything just ignore them the place was BEAUTIFUL I would go back anyday;5
I actually took this trip in January, 2011 but never got round to reviewing, probably due to the mixed feelings I have about this one.  This trip was booked through Nolitours which means rooms are booked on the Carisol side of this double resort.  The beach sand isn't as white as I prefer, and so the ocean isn't as aqua as I prefer.  But the unique thing about this beach is the way that the shallow swimming area is surrounded by reef.  There is a small opening through the reef out to the open ocean but this opening has crashing waves, making it unsafe for swimmers, snorkelers, kayaks and pedal boats to leave the protected area. However, I had a fantastic coral reef adventure when Frank from the dive shop took me through the opening in a pedal boat and gave me a guided tour of;3
i whent tosantigo de cuba at the club aimgocariso loscorales where here 23 and had a very good time the hotel was very good and the beach part was very fun i love it.and the cubaine guy and so  nice and there tokle good take of me.;5
We went March18. After reading all the reviews for this resort, I went there with low expectations. For the price I paid I figured I was going to be happy with the sun and the sand and if the resort was ok that would be a bonus. When we arrived at the airport we were in and out fast and on the bus. On the way to the resort I realized I didn't have the hotel vouchers and started to get a bit worried. I also thought we were staying at Carisol and we pulled up to Los Corales. But when the bus stopped my husband talked to the hola sun rep, he said that it was fine and that everyone is staying at Los Corales because they have closed the Carisol side. We checked fairly fast. When we arrived someone came around with drinks. That was nice. We got our rooms and I was really surprised how;4
We were a group of four in our mid-40s staying at the Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales (CACLC) for a week in February.  This was our first visit to this resort.  We picked this area for its promise of good weather at this time of year.  We were not disappointed as the weather was hot and sunny the entire week.  Our rooms were located on the Corales side, however we made use of both facilities.  Flight with Sunwing (our first experience with this company) was pleasant.  Check-in was smooth and fast.  Two of us did not pre-book our seats and we had no difficulty getting good seats together, both on the way down and back.  Flight was on time, attendants were nice, in-flight meals were good.  The arrival at Santiago was utter chaos.  Upon exiting the airport, we searched through the;2
…..In a heartbeat!! .....That’s not to say that the Resort is perfect – what resort is?  You can always find something wrong with a resort…if you’re looking!.....But, considering the price we paid for two weeks in February – this resort far exceeded our expectations! We had a wonderful time and we are already planning our return trip next year!  Here is my honest opinion/review of the Club AmigoCarisol LosCorales, Santiago de Cuba.  My husband and I and our cousin (all in our 50’s) stayed here for -2- weeks from February 19th – March 4th.2012.  As you have read from other reviews, there are 2 resorts (side-by-side) just a 5 minute walk separates the two. We stayed on the Los Corales side and we did notice that the Los Corales side definitely seemed “nicer”  - in fact, almost;4
I stayed at Club Amigo for one week, from Febuary 16-26. I was on the Carisol side in block 400. I was with 4 friends in two rooms on the 2nd floor. We are all in our early 20s. Read on for PROS and CONS.   - - -   PROS:   The Carisol side is smaller, but it is closer to the beach. Also, it seems that there are more young people (19-30) on this side. Since it is closer to the beach, it is closer to the Disco, which comes alive every night from about 11:00PM-4:00AM. Before the Disco opens, you will find all the young people at the pool bar, which is opened until 11:00PM. You can also get excellent coffees and cappuccinos there if you are not a drinker.   The Corales side, however, has a bigger buffet, and more food to choose from. There are shows on both sides, but there was a;4
Just got back from Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales for a family March break vacation.  We had read all the reviews on this site and decided to go there anyway.  Our overall ''Vacation'' rating is a 4 but if just looking at the hotel, it was a 1 1/2 to 2.  I think all good reviews on here are on the overall experience and not the hotel itself.  For people traveling on a budget and who can't make lemonade with lemons - it can become a horrible experience  We were supposed to get a bungalow room but they were over booked - we dealed for 2 connecting rooms as an accomodation.  2 Adults in a room and 2 kids in another.  This helped make our vacation much better.  But, for the rooms, the only desk was a work desk so only one drawer - we lived out of our suitcases all week.  The;2
My husband and I enjoyed a return visit to Los Corales from Feb 8th to the 15th.  Being our 2nd visit, we knew what to expect, and were not disappointed.  We booked a well priced 1 week vacation for 2 people for less than it would cost for 1 person to go to another high end island at this time of year.  The beach is perfect for sitting and reading, strolling, and swimming if you have your water shoes.  There is sea grass, and lots to see if you snorkel.  We enjoyed a hobie cat ride and there are pedal boats available.The pool is big, clean and has seats at the bar.  We only swam in the pool on 1 afternoon as we are beach bums.  We did enjoy sitting at the pool bar at the end of the day for a drink on our way back to our room.  The variety of restaurants between Carisol and Los;4
I am a first year student in university and I had decided to book a trip for Cuba with two of my other friends during my reading week. Majority of the occupants were elderly, it was almost as if we had gone to a retirement home. Nonetheless, we were not looking to mingle with others but have a good time with ourselves. However, small groups of young people arrived later on that week. This was my first trip to Cuba and we hadn't picked this particular location and hotel by choice, but mere luck and chance due to restricted expenses.   We came sort of skeptical of the place, almost afraid and reluctant to be honest. Of course, the weather was beautiful. We found the staff to be very warm and welcoming. Their hospitality is almost unbelievable. They're absolutely amazing. We tipped;4
"We are a couple in mid 30 and it was our first trip to Cuba. We stayed at Los Corales between Feb 5-12, 2012. Getting there by Canjet was smooth, arrived to Santiago de Cuba at around 8 pm. Transfer to the hotel was good (except a couple of young men on the bus too concerned about if they were gonna have enough time to get a beer and whose Spanish was limited to annoying ""una cerveza por favor"", which was pretty unfunny).   The room was great, clean, working fridge, free safety box, AC, TV with CNN, CTV, ESPN and a couple of local channels, the only problem was a shower head, but we got used to it. All the staff were friendly and helpful. There is one computer with internet access (you have to buy a card for 6 CUC and it's good for an hour of usage). Internet is very slow, but";4
We just came back from another fabulous week at Los Corales - Feb 14-21, 2012.  The weather alone is enough to have me returning there year after year.....it was blue skies and feels like 38-40 all week long - very hot.  We needed to apply and reapply sun block.  The doctor was making his rounds on the beach and at the the pools telling you to either get in the shade or giving you creams...we spent some time in the sun and lots of time in the shade.  We were three travelers, my 11yr old son, my cousin and myself.  This was our third time in Santiago de Cuba and second time at this resort.  I had absolutely no problem with the food.  I found there was a good selection of food - chicken, fish, pork chops, beef and vegetables galore!    You have to get used to Cuba time;4
I bought trip to Los Corales, however they gave room at Los Carisol Everithing loocks old and never renovated Food was horrible,my son got diarrhea . Programm not funny at all. Territory is durty.Everiver home enemal ship. Stuffs not friendly. Not recomended for yonge people. Not recomended for single. Recomended only for very poor family after 65;2
Only 1 bad thing about this resort they seem to run out of beer & coke so beware if you drink this and get to the buffet early, early as the food gets cold fast & picked over and goes fast. Rooms were clean, maids were friendly, weather was perfect very, very hot.  Good swim up bar,  outdoor b-b-q alacarte was very good, fish,pork or chicken.  Entertainment shows very nice fashion shows and fire eater amazing.  Beach windy at times but very white sand. Vendors on beach would barter I picked up 2 cuban instruments very cheap for 3 CUC's & 5 CUC's on the beach. All in all I would visit again as we only paid $1200 for 2 all in if the price was the same.  Met alot of fellow Canadians there at the time. Next trip will be to Holguin Apr 11- Apr 18 2012 to see another part of Cuba to;3
We have been traveling to Cuba for 8 year, so we know generally what to expect. But this time when arriving at Los Corales I knew I did a wrong step! Everything looks old and run down.  This is a good resort to relax, but the food was horrible! This was the worst food I have ever been served in my life. A lot of birds and bugs in the restaurant. Dogs and cats around the food service areas and asking for food. The pizza and spagetti were OK.  We were shocked at the lack of amenities in this time. But do not worry about lack of drinks, if you want an extra bottle of wine just ask Odalis in the restaurant (little fat, blonde with short hair). For only $2.00 convertible pesos, she’ll give you a good bottle of wine (“Antre rios”, I think) You can buy some other stuff outside the;1
We wanted the south of Cuba for reliable warm weather in Jan. Also the price was great! Good: The Santiago de Cuba airport is clean and efficient.Upon leaving the store there also has some cheaper gifts and booze than the resort.  The drive to the resort is beautiful with lots of mountain views as well as seeing lots of local culture. We were at Carisol which just re-opened Jan. It needs many repairs that are not just day to day things, but results from a hurricaine a few years back. Within a day much of the clean-up and gardening was being done as well as some new windows at the villas. This side was less busy and very quiet. The beach and snorkelling were great. There is some sand for swimming, a large reef and lots of free paddleboats etc. There were shade trees and lots of;3
We started off with our flight being late, but we had no problems at the Cuba airport, getting on our bus and checking into our room. I got exactly what I requested when I booked, a 2nd floor room facing the pool. We were on the Carisol side. Which didn't matter to us. Most people prefered the Corales side. The room was big and clean. We did have some small ants, but not a big deal. Air was great, bathroom was fine and yes the beds are hard. We used the extra blankets under our heads and I always bring an extra pillow. This is a 3* resort. We paid $1729.00 for 3 of us and we got what we expected for that price with the bonous of the beautiful countryside all around us. We walked back and forth the each side to use every thing between the 2 resorts. Yes there is more to offer at;3
This was our 6th trip to Los Corales and will probably be our last.  As mentioned in earlier reviews, this location has gone down hill so badly and as a result, we are not prepared to suffer through another stay.  The food is the same every day with no variety. Cabbage, cabbage and more cabbage.  Bones in the soup, bones in the hamburger, bones in the pasta, bones in just about anything you eat.  You must be careful.   There is little selection of fruit and they no longer have orange juice. Cereal is a choice of one when we left.  It's a little thing but it is just one of the many areas that that are deteriorating.  The number of dogs running through and around the dining area is bad.  The dogs frequently fight.  Guests do not understand that these dogs are filled with worms and;1
"I travelled to Carisol Los Corales with my snorkel buddy and her husband. We had visited Bucanero last January, so we knew in advance the weather would be perfect, and we were not disappointed. Wonderful, warm sunshine every single day! The bus ride to the hotel was picturesque, and check in went smoothly. We stayed at the Los Corales side and began our week in the 500 block, which we found somewhat noisy at night. The next day we changed our rooms to the 100 block, which was much quieter.The rooms were very nice, although I found the beds a bit hard for my comfort, a usual problem for me in Cuba. Other than that, everything about the room was good. The A/C worked well, although it was a bit noisy but since ""white noise"" helps to cover exterior noises, I didn't find it";4
Well, much to our disappointment Los Corales has gone downhill since our last visit in January of 2011.  Very sad indeed.  It appears the Cuban government isn't investing money into this resort and it shows.  The place is in need of repair.  There isn't one 'big' thing that requires repair, it's all the small things that add up.  There has been a lot of staff changes and removal of staff without replacing.  We noticed there were not as many security guards looking after the place.  There used to be one per block, not sure how many they have now, but not that.  We don't got to Cuba for the food, period, but I have to say, this year it was atrocious.  So many people at the resort had stomach/intestinal ailments.  Personally, I ended up with food poisoning two nights before we were;2
This was our 3rd visit in this resort. We knew what to expect from this 3* and we got all we needed: 2 sunny weeks over Christmas holidays, with plenty of simple and healthy food (without cooking or serving others at home!), great beach time (yes, there is an excellent sandy beach with plenty of chairs, paddleboats, kayaks and morning to noon sport activities!) and few interesting area trips. Rooms were very clean and towels changed daily, excellent pool, cold drinks at bars all the time.  New Year's Eve dinner was nice.  Seafood restaurant choices were our favorite. Coffee at lobby bar is the best! The most important, people in the resort are very nice and very attentive. They will always greet you with a nice smile and will be ready to help you if you need it! They are;4
We stayed at Los Corales from Jan. 15 to the 22. Late check-out was free on the day we left. Santiago airport was easy to get mixed up on arrival. The porters carried our bikes to the wrong bus and demanded a tip. They had no idea which bus we needed to be on, just move the bikes 30 feet and intimidate my kids. Bad experience on arrival. Nothing to do with the resort. At Los Corales check-in was easy. The rep suggested getting a meal while the ONE person at the desk handled the 24 people checking in.  BARS.  The bars have varying hours which are confusing to follow. The pool bar is open from 12ish to 5ish. The Theatre bar is open from 5ish till after the show at 10:30ish. The 24 hour bar serves booze when the other bars are closed. It has beer all the time, and the theatre bar;3
We have been to Cuba seven times and this is our third time in Santiago, first at this hotel.   I did realize that we did not pay a fortune for this trip but I was shocked at the lack of amenities in this hotel. Our room was adequate but I heard others did not have power. Washrooms adjacent to the buffet never had paper and also did not have working sinks with soap. Makes me wonder how the food service staff whom I watch use these facilities washed their hands.   While I am on that let me say that this is the worst food I have ever been served in my life. Birds and bugs in the restaurant on the bread and cheese and in the deserts. They never turned on the ceiling fans and that was a good thing as they covered in bird poop. Dogs and cats are constantly around the food service;2
"Dec. 2011/Jan 2012  The good:  -off-the-beach nice snorkeling -lots to see in the surrounding area for a 7-day holiday -laid-back, friendly, casual atmosphere -decent beach - not too busy either -beautiful setting -mountains and large beach  The bad: -  lack of organization -  accountability if something goes wrong.  (this is still pending... I'm awaiting a response from Management and from SunWing on having paid and extra $130.00 for ""Oceanview Bungalow""  and never getting what I had paid for.  So.... I'll give a full rating after I see whether or not they will act honorably....)";2
This time we flew CanJet from Toronto, a first for me.  The flight was very smooth and we landed about 15 minutes early.  The supplied meals were tasty, but still airline food.  Upon arrival, and the customary shuttle through Customs, we retrieved our bags from the conveyor.  For those new to Cuba, all luggage coming on to the conveyor are 'sniffed' by dogs while they are coming out to you.  That friendly  puppy is sniffing out any drugs you may have!  DO NOT try to bring recreational drugs into the country.  The penaly is very severe!  The customary rush by porters to grab your bags and move them the 30 feet to your bus is inevitable , as well as the hands out for their tip!  They will not accept Canadian coins and that leaves you in the unenviable position of having to pay $5,;3
I travel to Cuba every year so I know generally what to expect. When arriving at this resort I knew I made a mistake! It is clean but looks old and run down. I was supposed to stay in the bungalow but there was no water, no electricity, ants in the beds and the curtains and hardware fell off the wall! The food is horrible, not much selection and one day I had dessert and ants were crawling out of the pastry!! The only snacks you could get we're hot dogs and hamburgers (which were raw) and if you could ignore the prep. The guy cooking handled the raw meat, wiped sweat off his head and handled food again with his greasy hands!!  The ocean is warm but you can hardly walk in for coral, so I would say it is the worst beach in Cuba.   My advice is try somewhere else! I would rate this;1

After reading decent ratings on Trip Advisor and getting what we thought was a good deal ($600 plus $200 tax) on Cyber Monday, we decided to take a chance.  We had initially been looking at Club Bucanero which on the same day was $200 cheaper per person.  We thought if we spent more, we would have better facilities since the Carisol/Corales resort was supposed to be a two in one and appeared to have a better beach.  We found out the positive ratings were about Corales side since the Carisol side had been closed for 8 months & opened the day we arrived. They weren't ready for us. Broken toilets, no hot water, no telephone, no tv.  I could care less about the lack of tv and telephone but not having a flushing toilet was annoying and all the decent food was on the Corales side of;2
Hello to all future Los Corales travellers, I just came back yesterday from a week full of nothing but fun! For a vacation under 560$ a person, this place is the best hotel you will find for this price. True, it is more rustic than the Melia and the Riu, but there is also a huge price difference.   ROOMS: This property has 2 hotels, so before you book, make sure you are staying at Los Corales, as it is much better maintained and more people (unless you like the quiet). My husband and I had a bungalow right near the beach and it was very spacious. For me, the most important thing was that there should be no bed bugs, and indeed there werent any. On occaision, there were ants in the room but nothing more than a couple. Also, if you keep the air conditioning on there wont be any;4
"The first day we went to the resort i was horrified because of the food, I know everyone says that you dont go to Cuba for the food..but the food here was destroyed. Luckily we brought our own spices and seasoning. This helped out alot and we tipped the chef to make our food with the spices..this worked out well they were happy to help out. If you go to Carisol ask for Yunior he is an amazing cook and will be happy to help you. Otherwise it is a beautiful resort. I visited Varadero before and  Santiago was so much more""authentic"" Cuba and not so touristy. There is so much to do such as snorkeling, horse back riding to the mountains, scuba diving, visiting the dolphin aquarium, etc...The people on this resort are so genuwine and I would go back just to see them again. Apparently";3
Trip via Sunwing out of Montreal Dec 29th Jan 5th...  The Good:  The location, scenery, ocean, weather, people, relaxation are fantastic. It had been almost 3 years since our last visit and there was a visible small improvement in the state of the resort..we still did not have hot water a few times.. not big deal when its 30+oC .. the power went out a few times.. it was nice to site by the pool without the sound of the filter and the dj  for a bit :)   Our server Rebeca from before was there and as accommodating and wonderful as ever. When she was on we never had to worry if you would find a table... she always had a good one saved for us..  Even over the New Year week the resort was not over crowded. Loungers where easily had at the pool and the beach.. lots of activities for;3
"The resort itself was OK, but the location, weather and activities were great. Nice place to relax and have fun with the family, especially considering the awesome value.  The resort, Club Amigo comes in two sections: ""Carisol"" and ""Los Corales"". We've stayed at Carisol, which only opens during high vacationing seasons when Los Corales is fully booked. There is a pathway linking the two hotels which guests are encouraged to share the amenities (restaurants, pools, services, etc.) and the beach. We were informed that the hotels went under heavy damage from hurricanes, so the resort was not the most sightly scene. The rooms were good and clean, but some have broken water boilers, toilets and lack hot water most of the time. There is a TV, fridge, combination safe (free), air";4
BEWARE THESE ARE FOR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN WHO WANT TO BE IN THE SAME SPACE NOT FOR FAMILIES WITH TEENAGERS. We booked thinking it would be a two room bungalow, but were surprised to find that all four adult size family members were sharing one room.  It took five full days to finally get seperate rooms and way too much time spent at the front desk with unconcerned staff. Take travel candles the Hydro went our for over 24 hours in our Bungalow. The view was amazing and most of the service staff were fantastic, bland food and not best choices for vegetarians, everything (beans and rice) had a bit of meat added. The beach and pool were great again fantastic staff at both locations.;3
Overall, liked everything yes, facilities are outdated and do not always function properly, but the customer service is amazing, will always change (if needed) or fix everything! Nice environment, very friendly local people. Don't see lots of beggars on the beach or on the road. Did hicking and jogging outside the hotel every morning for a few hrs- no problem!  HUGE beach, lots of activities! we went to Santiago de Cuba (tour by bus), costs 65/person (includes guided tour, lobster lunch, and one museum). Heard you can get a cab one way for 40$, so if you don't really want to know the history of the place and there are a few of you- hire the cab.   The food is very simple, but really tasty! No problems otherwise. Will come back there for sure.  PS if you have some old clothes or;4
Cuba is not for the nit- pickers and the haughty. Want satin sheets and yes Masta service, there are plenty of places in the Caribbean that will happily max your credit card. Cuba offers basic amenities and the people are always dignified and smiling. Therefore, leave your prejudices at home and just relax in your shell. At least that is how I approach every new trip anywhere. It always amazes me that for around $800.00 one can spend 14 nights being fed , accomodated, flown to and entertained in Cuba. The whether is almost always pretty good and to think that almost $300.00 of the cost is taxes.   I am not a boozer and thus drinks don't matter to me. Coffee..well that is my forte and the coffee bar at Corales is just peachey. Food...always something available. You cannot starve.;4
Some great reports have been recently posted. Kudos to the writers.  We have submitted a reasonable number, most of which now appear on this site. We hope this provides a somewhat different perspective while meeting  the criteria of the moderators. It is in a manner of speaking an attempt to provide a more two-way view to some of the situations we encountered and/or observed.     This (December 8th) is not our first trip to Santiago de Cuba, nor this facility. First, Cuba is not a good destination for some travellers who clearly get overly consumed by the price. Another consideration, who are your  fellow travellers and can price tell you something about them?   In past posts, we have provided  a laundry list of items one might consider prior to booking a Cuba vacation. The fact;4
"Our room and maid service was very good and the natural surroundings are beautiful BUT the management needs a refresher course on how to run a proper establishment. In spite of promoting itself as a family oriented hotel,prostitution flourished - some of the girls seemed in their early teens.It was disgusting to see them cavorting around the pool with men in their 60s and 70s!Management turned a blind eye to our protestations.We witnessed money being exchanged for services at the front desk.Our Sunwing Rep.( Bobby ) just shrugged his shoulders. Many other issues included the fact the Carisol side of the hotel was moth-balled and looked like it should be condemned;food was lukewarm and boring most of the time;the coffee machine in the buffet restaurant broke on day#2 and wasn't";2
We've been to Cuba 3 times in the past year and love it, only wish we had discovered years ago. Our first hotel was 2 1/2 star and the last two were 3 Star. This resort was disappointing especially after our best experience at another Club Amigo resort.   The service at the hotel was outstanding, the hotel staff were very friendly and did their best to make our stay enjoyable. We didn't see any unhappy staff, only warm friendly smiles and every one of them made an effort to communicate.  The food was most disappointing. The main buffet was nasty and very repetitive. There was a BQ at the beach but not a very pleasant area to eat and relatively remote to the hotel. The game room area did serve sandwiches but got tired of that fast. There didn't seem to be a restaurant anywhere;3
I love Cubian people since I've been in Club Amigo De Portillo. From this vacation feel tired. Entertainment - like in a strip bar. Not for kids!!! Just billiard made my son happy. Nobody entertaining children. Sea weed around you legs in the water. Only one key for three people. Stress from people behind the fence. Give them clothes, whatever - they will bugg you all your vacation.  Suggestion: if you go, take bungalow - far away from the fence, closer to the beach.  By the way employees are very good. Rebecca in the restaurant, Ridia - housekeeper. So: if you single and man - you will like it.;3
Overall: good value for the money, nothing spectacular, good cheap activities available- see below. Don't expect much, be prepared to be firm if you need to, brush up on french (locals speak it sometimes) and spanish. Lots of greenery and flowers. This was in December. I hear it all burns out by March. Mountains are beautiful.  Rooms:  clean, bathroom a bit shabby but everything works fine, good water pressure, no mould. Choose the 100's for a quieter room, 2nd floor to avoid chance of bugs and hearing people's heels, very high ceiling, feels nice a spacious. A/C is pretty loud. Balcony doors- you need some muscle to open them but they're operational. Safe is included in the room so don't let them charge you for it.  Currency conversion: When it's less than 1, they multiply.;4
Visited Nov 10-2011 -  Nov 24-2011. Room 521. Excellent service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will definitely come again.  We normally visit Cuba 3-4 times a year. Just returned from Varadero. this is our first time in Santiago area. About the hotel,-very clean and excellent service. Very friendly people. No complains at all. Food is excellent!!!  Bars, drinks - also excellent. During 2 weeks in this hotel we did not have even a one negative point. They really try to make you happy and take care about your stay. Room - very clean, made daily. Breakfast - eggs, butter, bread, salami, soft cheese, hard cheese, yogurt, cereal, omelets station, fresh juices, tea, coffee,fresh fruits and ext.  Dinner - always 3 different kind of meat, fish, rice, potato, squash, soup,;5

We are repeated customers at Los Corales!  It is situated on the south east  side of Cuba and the weather is reliable -always warm and sunny. The hotel is clean and staffs are great!  We had a day trip on the catamaran that sails to Santiago de Cuba. Our host is William – We snorkelled and had a great lunch at the port of Santiago de Cuba with a beautiful view.  After lunch, William took us around the city to shop and to drink beer at one of the local bars. What a great day…  My husband and I also had the chance to dive and snorkel.  While I snorkelled with Sergio, my husband went diving with the diving team:  Celso and Ernesto.  Frank, sailor/diver and Orlando, skipper were always at the beach ready to take you  out on the hobby-cat and / or speed boat.  Though the food was;5

Where to start first ! ~ The hotel is very clean  ~ Staff are amazing, the omlette lady, Barbo (sunwing) Juliette from the pool bar, I forget there names but the tour guy and the DJ ! They made you feel like family :) Everyone was so nice !!  ~ They have a variety of day trips. I swam with the doplins a must DO ! and horse back ride to the water fall. The guy that does the horse back ride is so kind.  ~ The food, well I dont know why everyone complaints honestly. They have such a large variety like chicken, beef, pork, bread, pizza, cumcumbers, noodles, salads, hamburgers, hot dogs, potatoes, soups etc. ~The night shows were amazing ~ There was always something going on like salas lessons, spanish lessons, aqua fit, BINGO, etc  I recommend this hotel to everyone ! And I will be;5
"i have been to cuba twice and many other carribean places, rating all stars right up to a 5 star. this being a 3.5 star i was unsure of what to expect. i was pleasantly surprised each day i spent there. everything is in walking distance from each other (pool, beach, front lobby, rooms, disco, beach bar, and marina on the beach). they have great staff and great service , they also have great food. i went expecting to loose weight, and i in fact gained weight. i even brought ketchup and mustard packages (but they had that already). the marina offers everything you could want; AMAZING snorkeling, windsurfing, boating, scuba diving, etc. the rooms are clean, the chambermaids are nice, the managers and front reception staff are all very accommodating. the los corales is the better of";4
Just back from Los Corales. Nov 3- 10/11. Overall a pretty good trip. The weather was hot as usual for Santiago. No rain! The resort is very well kept, no garbage laying around. Great gardens! The beach has great sand but a small swimming area and shallow. Water shoes should be used but not a must. Snorkeling was very good. Did not see any Mozzies at all! The food could upgraded substantially. You just get enough to eat as is at most 3 star Cuban resorts. Other 3 stars have had roasts, turkey etc. but not here at this time. High season is coming so hopefully it will improve. Overall the food was just alright. The staff we found were excellent.... from the front desk,maids,bartenders to the gardners. We have spent alot of time on the Cuban south shore so we did not do alot of day;3
We spent a week n this hotel it was nice the room was good but we had company a lizard the staff did try to find it but was no where in sight. Staff are nice always willing to help and never lookin for tips the food was very good thats a plus since my husband is a very picky eater. the enetertainment was good when they have it (usually every other night) the synchronize swimmer was really good. the beach we didnt like it was rocky but its good for snorkelling, too much water plant n the beach we had very liltle space to swim in. The water sports were amazing, we enjoy all water amneties they had to offer with no line up to get ur turn. we enjoy the pedal boat we used it every day and the snorkel device they had, tip on this beach is BRING WATER SHOE. Every tours they had was;4
We have travelled a lot including Cuba.  I spent 6 weeks in India so I am used to adjusting my standards.  We got a good deal on this resort so we went for it because we love Cuba.  Unfortunately it was not the Cuba we love.  The best: snorkellers paradise!  Walk in and snorkel right away.  The rooms were also quite nice and clean for Cuba.  We found no bug issues and it is a nice quiet resort.  They even offered a free shuttle bus to town once a week.  The worst: new staff all around.  They don't seem to be confident or have the language skills.  The waiters try to avoid eye contact and ignore you.  There are a few gems like Natalia but they only work a day here and there.  It seems everyone is getting few hours.  We tipped every time and even gave gifts but still got ignored.;2
This resort is really nice, kind of what is to be accepted as a 3 star hotel but hey the rooms were clean, pool clean, food good, beach was ok, great for snokeling, bars are stocked. I definaly will go back, had the time of my life. The only thing that i wasn't happy with was being as we were the first group of people there this season, the internet wasn't hooked up yet so couldn't email home to let my love ones know i was safe and sound but other than that it was great. Horseback riding was amazing, went into the mountains and went to cool off in a spring fed hole. It was pretty cheap to do this too. Also did the dolphin show and swim, went by horse and buggy, what an experience to swim with the dolphins. Bartenders were amazing, always had a drink ready for me....met some nice;4
We recently spent a week at this hotel. We were surprised with layout and rooms as it shows very well. The pool was large and nicely layed out near the rooms. The rooms were very nice with flat screen TV's and kept very clean. The maid was very nice and helpful she even gave us a bottle of honey when we were leaving in thanks for the gifts we had brought her. The beach is large and quit clean as was the resort. There are many dogs roaming the grounds and occasionly you might see a horse, goat or cow roaming around. This hotel is about 45 min from the airport on a very curvy road and this accounts for much of the time. On the down side the food variety was very poor with not much to choice from much the same every night. For some reason no coffee was served at dinner time and to;3
We went to this resort 2009 for one week and 2010 for two weeks. Both year just after Chirstmas. First of all the beach is very nice, little rocky, be prepared for that. Snorkeling there is amazing. My husband and me really beach people, so we're usually not leaving the beach all day. We eat in the beach restaurant. in 2009 they has fried chicken there, it was perfect for lunch. Unfortunately they dropped that from the menu last year, so we had to go up couple of times to the restaurant for lunch. If you take you own ketchup and mustard with you, you could still eat there....hamburgers and hotdogs are Ok if you have something on... On our second visit the food was much much worse than the first time. We really had to smell the meat before we eat any. Especially on the first;3
We flew Sunwing and arrived in Cuba about 11 PM.  Then the hour ride to the Hotel property.  Needless to say, everyone was tired..... and really surprised when we found out that we wouldn't be staying at the same hotels!  This hotel is 2 properties about 5 minutes walk away and you have the use of either one's facilities.  A last minute change required that 1/2 the bus had to stay at the Carisol side while the rest went to Los Corales.  Registration was slow but once registered we were escorted to our rooms very quickly!  The next morning, a number of guests went to the obligatory meeting to hear about the services that Sunwing offered....tours, etc.  When the guests at the Carisol saw that Los Corales was a little more classy, and a lot larger,  they immediately requested to;3
"We spent a few nights in the Carisol and then were transferred to the Corales, so we saw both hotels.  Upon our arrival in Cuba, the bus took us from the airport to the Carisol, where we were greeted with exotic drinks and quickly checked in.  Julio, a hotel employee, carried our bags to room # 502.  The room reeked of dampness (a little), it had an air conditioner, two beds, safe, TV set, fridge and telephone; since it was located at the ground level, we could sit in front of our room.  There was always hot water.  There were plenty of seemingly empty buildings (bungalows), probably being renovated.  Every morning we left some gifts to the maid and we always had a perfectly clean room, with very original arrangements made of towels and flower petals.  The beach was sandy, wide,";5
It was the third time in the Santiago area - and last time was at the same resort but on the Carisol side.  Had a wonderful time again, met a bunch of great people - and enjoyed meeting the staff members again.  The catamaran cruise to Santiago was a really good outing, and the mountain hike.  Animators and guides were very well informed and gave us a really good time.  The food was OK, not great, but nutritious and lots of it, and the bars were always well stocked.  Nightly entertainment was good, dance lessons were fun and Disco nights at the beach bar were a blast- stargazing was amazing, dancing on the deck or the  beach was always great fun.    This resort is in the Sierra Maestro area, and the drive from the airport is very scenic - the resort is set between the Mountains;4
We stayed at this resort for a week in February and enjoyed our stay for the most part. The resort is by no means fancy or top-notch, but there is still opportunity to enjoy it as long as you go with an open mind. This Club Amigo resort is made up of two sister compounds, Carisol and Los Corales. The facilities on both compounds are open to all guests (including the beach, restaurants, pools, and bars). There are plenty of beach activities to keep you busy if you plan on staying at the resort the whole time, like snorkeling, kayaking and sailing. There are a lot of amazing creatures to see close to shore and we found ourselves snorkelling our days away. The resort provides entertainment every night (concerts, magic shows, etc) and there are many excursions you can sign up for;3
I went into this trip with low expectations. It was organized by a group of friends for cheap cheap ($600 including flight and taxes from Ottawa). How is it even possible to be so cheap? When I got there my low expectations were met, but over the week things got better. At $600 for a week I don't feel I have much right to complain, because it ended up being decent.  When we got there they couldn't find our reservations so they shipped us to their sister hotel where they insisted we must be, and back anf forth we went (walking in 30 degree heat with luggage). Finally someone found our rooms. I am certain this happens all the time as they probably just have an overlap for part of a day. The staff at the desk was incredibly unhelpful and rude at that time. They said we could go;3
"We have travelled all over Cuba,Jamaica,Mexico and Dominican Republic and by no means...""5 star travellers"" but I must admit C/A Carisol was the most run down place we have ever stayed.   Was shocked when I witnessed a horse drinking from the swimming pool (yes there are horses roaming all over the compound) not to mention the ""horse droppings"" all over the walkways and brown grass. Decrepid abandoned villas -Likely damaged from hurricanes but no cash to restore them.   Lovely white sandly beach but very little swimming area of the same (mainly rocky- bring water shoes) Staff are very reluctant to serve you unless you produce the cash....Dont get me wrong- they are friendly enough but very slow service unless you tip well. Witnessed young beautiful latino ladies on the resort";1
"Being somewhat experienced Cuban travellers, we have seen a lot of the culture and have made many Cuban friends, so much so that we forgo seeing many other places. That being said this hotel which we have fond memories dating back to 1998 has seen  many changes and a steady decline. Cuban service at it's best is ""help yourself"" in most cases but it has gotten worse due to economic conditions. The bright light that used to shine through the staff's eyes has become a vacant, ""I don't care anymore but tip many anyway"" attitude. There is always an exception to the rule but this is the general attitude. The chambermaids are overtly desperate more than ever and don't even do a good job cleaning. Front desk reception is fine, though. We still could put up with all this except for the";1
I was at this resort the last week of April with 7 other girlfriends - All of us in our 20's.  We had a great vacation with Club Amigo.  The staff are all VERY friendly.  Sandro - one of the entertainment staff was probably our favourite as he is so nice and always made sure we were having a good time :)   The food was pretty good for the most part.  Bring some immodium as a couple of us were minorly sick a couple of days.  The food is just repetitive.  Best meal of the day was breakfast as there is a lady who makes delicious omelletes or fried eggs and bacon every morning.  YUM! We had hotdogs and hamburgers most days for lunch down by beach restaurant.  Those were really good too!   When the Dr. approached you for a massage I highly recommend you go.  It was only 10 pesos for;4
I went to this Hotel because some friends recommended to me, they are now too old to travel. My family and three other families decided to go for the first time. The hotel is not too bad if you are traveling only to enjoy the Cuban sun but the problems just start when you have to Eat or Drink, the service at bars and restaurants is awful, we decided to have a contact with the person in charge of F&B service but he always had  more important things to do, so we concluded they don't care about clients. Our advice, find another place to spend your holidays, but if you still want to try by yourselves in Los Corales , please be sure to bring your own foods and drinks.;2
We just returned home on Tuesday May 2 after spending 9 days at Club Amigo Los Corales resort.  We had a blast!  The weather was awesome everyday.  High 80's and it only rained two of the 9 evenings.    The pool bar was great...always room to get a drink and we met some great people sitting around the bar...had a lot of laughs.  Juliet and Ovidio were great bartenders...even they had a few i think!!!  Rooms were spacious and clean.  Cleaning staff worked hard to make sure all our rooms were straighted up everyday.  No bugs to speak of although we did have a really big spider in our bathroom, that unfortunately didn't make it........It was either him or me go and well, I won...hahaha!  Food was a little bland for my liking.....but i always found something that i could eat, so it;3
"I don't want to be redundant of so many others who say food and rooms are crap. So I wont say more on that. It is a beautiful no frills resort. You only stay in the room to shower and sleep- so who cares.  Milka ( he looks like John Travolta) at the Ala carte was great, and made the dinners there even better. If you treat him well (tip) wise he may have a ""proposition"" for you, and you may eat better a few extra times.. I have to share my very negative massage experience. As I had read on here a massage was available for $10 for 30min. I was like hell ya! I said I might get one everyday at that price. I went in and as stated the sheet was not clean it was oilyI asked for a clean one she begrudgingly oblidged. I felt a little uncomfortable at that point and chose to only undress";3
"Let me start off with this, this is a 3 Star but the staff is 5 Stars hands down… They will make your stay great… We came in by Canjet and our Travel Company was Hola Sun Vacations. When we got to the airport, some nice Cuban grabbed our bags and put them on the bus going to the Resort. It was the wrong bus that was ok; I got to meet Flex that helped us out a ton. Flex told me that I should talk with Mario from Hola Sun Vacations and tell him my bags are on the wrong bus and we will be staying with our bags and Mario was fine with that and told us to meet him in the morning to go over day trips… Got to the resort and they meet the bus with drinks that was great RON punch… We went to our room and it was a good size for what I was thinking, 2 beds, a fridge, a flat screen TV,";3
"just got back from a 1 week stay on April 17th.  It was my 5th time back at this resort.  As I am a repeated guest at this resort I was invited to a ""special dinner""  which consisted of champagne, soup, salad, turkey and gravey, mashed potatoes, carrots, fish and vegetables on a skewer, rice , fried plantane, ice cream and a cream puff for dessert and a shot of the 15  yr old cuban rum.  The meal was excellent.  Sandros said a speach during this special dinner and it was so true what he said.  We continue to go back to this resort because of the people, not because this is a luxerious hotel.  It cost me and my husband  $1100.00 taxes and medical insurance included. ( you get what you pay for) It is a 3 star hotel which has everything you need.  The rooms consist of 2 beds, air";3
My stay here was very pleasing. The Staff definitely make the difference at this location. For the most part, they are very Friendly, inquisitive, and very willing to help. I did the Horseback 3 hour ride to the Mountains, I would recommend this, however I arranged for 09:00, I would recommend 08:00 or earlier, the heat in the Valley in which you travel is brutal. For the most part not even a gentile breeze, take water, and lots of it.  Arrival in Santiago was almost, well...surprising and a breeze in comparison to Varadero or La Habana. Customs a breeze as well. Ready at the Hotel, though it was 23:50 at night.  I visited Santiago De Cuba City 2 times. Saturday's (this does change so check), there is a free shuttle Bus that drops you off at 11:30 or so and brings you back at;3
First off I don't know why all those people are complaining. This place is AMAZING. I just got back last night and had the time of my life. Met so many great people and learned so much about Cuban culture and their lifestyle. The staff are amazing as well, Miguel always played great music by the pool, our sunwing rep Barbaro made sure we were always taken care of and treated like princesses. The food was really good, very repetitive but if you change it around its not a problem. The staff at the front desk were always happy to help you and always made you smile. Fernedo the bar tender is the best. made the best drink even let me and my friends behind the bar to make our own drinks. The resort is mostly older people but we are in our 20's and had a blast. Our room was great (521);5
Great place, garanteed good time! Staff is extremely friendly, you can tell they enjoy their work. Get to know the locals, you can find some hidden treasures of cuba with them. For about 35$, we got taken on a day tour of santiago, with a lobster lunch at a local house and a visit of a rhum factory. The dolphin show down the road is great fun too, although the rest of the park is not impressive. You can also go horseback riding in the mountains for 4 hour including a visit of an alligator farm for about 10$ a person. Most of these locals are right outside the hotel (although be careful of the fake cigars- make sure you know your stuff if you're purchasing from a local).  Yes the food is average, but it is better than most other places in cuba. Do bring some snacks because you;5
This was my first trip to Cuba, and I went with a friend who'd been to this resort many times over the past few years. I'd read many reviews so I knew what to expect, and I was more than satisfied with my stay. The resort was very quiet, as this isn't a popular time of year to go south, but it was very relaxing. The staff were wonderful, the room was comfortable, I didn't starve or get sick, and I came home with a tan! I made such great friends at the resort that I'm already planning to go back in July.;4
Stayed at Corales the first week of April.  Pool very nice and clean. Our room was right in front of the pool. Sandy beach was nice with lots of chairs and trees for cover but the actual water had small rocks and had sea wead. Water shoes worked good.  Snorkeling was good.  Our room was basic and clean and had very nice towel art every day.  Some of the people we talked to were sent to Carisol which was not supposed to be opened and was not prepared for these people.  Apparently they said they were over booked. The Carisol had no resturants or bars opened.   The food was not bad for a 3*.  Breakfast had eggs and OJ with fresh bread.  For lunch you could go to the buffet (had a pizza and pasta bar) or go to the beach for burgers, hot dogs, fries and chicken. The dinner buffet was;3
"This resort was amazing! Don't get me wrong; it's not Canada but it's CUBA! The beach was gorgeous; plenty of chairs and activities out by the water. Lifeguard on staff, free scuba rentals (get there early) and a catamaran ride and paddle boats. Bar on the beach, get your drinks and enjoy the sun. You have access to BOTH resorts, two swimming pools, 2 full buffets, 2 a la carte (seafood), a hamburger/hotdog picnic and a pasta/pizza bar. Don't expect a four star resort, and you will enjoy yourself immensely.";4
Beach was great, pool was great, the room was great, the people were great, Felix the Nolitours rep was great, but the dinner buffet was awful. It ran from 7:30 to 9:30 and we would get there by about 8:30, food was cold, missing or unidentifiable. We have been to Cuba 5 times and this was the worst.  Breakfast with the nice lady making omlettes was good, burgers by the beach were good and the ala carte restraurants were good.  The cook came out and he was sweating like a dog, and wearing a baseball cap, did not exactly instill confidence. If you go don't have any expectations about food quality, take your own grub.;2
I read many of the other reviews before going and they were mostly very accurate.  Ill begin with the bad & the ugly:  The hotel(s) are filled with old Italians from Toronto and Montreal.  They hog all the orange juice in morning, they cut in line for morning omlettes & bacon (the only really good food there) many of them are very rude.  The resort is run down its 30 years old and farm animlas roam freely.  70 year old Italians (men and woman)  flaunt there rental cuban brides quite shamelessly.  Some of the bartenders will not serve you if they suspect you will not tip.   The Good The coffee is fantastic and there are ripe coconuts everywhere I drank 5 a day.  The snorkelling is amazing around the restort, they have good flippers but there masks and breathing tubes are pretty;3
My wife and are 12 year old son spent a week at Club Amigo Los Corales from 03/24/11 to 04/01/11, the hotel is nice our room very clean and the maid was wonderful.  The food was typical Cuban food which we don't mind at all the fish is delicious and so are the Hot dogs down at the beach.  The pool area is beautiful lots of room plenty of chairs and the pool bar quite nice and the service ok.  The beach just ok lots of Seaweed and Coral but that was expected after reading the reviews.  The scenery is beautiful with all the mountains around the 1 hour bus ride seems long but again the scenery is quite interesting.  I would go back again.  the only complaint is that you have to buy beer after 11pm at the Disco but other than that is was a good vacation.;3
"Sunwing: Good service, on time, courteous staff Nolitours Rep: ""Felix""  - organized,helpful and accessible Check-in : Smooth -again Felix expedited it by having our cards filled in and handed to us on the bus.

I have been to Cuba several times and usually never have stayed at a 3 star hotel but let me tell you that this was probably one of my most favourite places in Cuba. The hotel was very clean, food and drinks were great, staff was very friendly and helpful. Maritza the waitress was a amazing and provided great service and Anna the head of helpdesk was also very helpful. I'm already thinking of booking for next year at the same resort.;5
Trip was amazing, employees were helpful and took care of all our needs.  Food was average at best but other than that it was a great vacation and would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great place to go with friends.;3
The place was nice we had  clean rooms  and most of the staff were excellent. The food was CRAP. The beach was awesome, the shows we seen were ok.They serve Beef tounge most nights, cabbage cooked one way or another some food we didn't no what it was. Hope you like a lot of rice if you go to this resort, its the only thing you can rely on.;3

Myself and 15 other friends just returned home from  Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales on feb 28th and we had a wonderful time. We booked our trip through nolitours and flew through canjet on the 20th of February. We had absolutely no problems with our flights and the service was great. Our Nolitours rep Felix was extremely kind and helpful and he was always on the resort from 8-3. He made sure to find us each day and make sure that our trip was going well and that we had no problems. We stayed at the carisol side of the resort in the 100-200 blocks and had no problems with our rooms besides the fact that some of them had no hot water. These rooms are right beside the pool and pool bar and can get quite loud, so if your looking for something quiet i would suggest picking another;5
My husband and I returned on Feb 17th from a wonderful week at Los Corales.  The hotel met all our expectations, and we plan on returning next January or February. The weather makes this a very attractive area.  Truly a great value, especially if you purchase your package when there is a sale.  Before booking, I read many reviews and the forums. I also contacted Coral Queen for specific information, and DeblovesSantiago also provided me with some good info, so I knew what to expect, and I wasn’t disappointed.  Sunwing flight there and back was great.  Good service, pleasant flight attendants. Flights on time, actually a little early.  We stayed on the Los Corales side, and I didn’t venture over to Carisol this time.  This hotel is not new, but it is spotless!  I requested a room;4
All and all worth the $600 for all inclusive BEACH - was ok, need water shoes, water is clear and snorkelling is fantastic.  Chairs are uncomfortable bring pillows!!    FOOD - buffet was 3 star, not too bad, spice was alright but still brought our own hot sauce.  Unfortunately went when there was an Italian convention and if we didn't get there on time, no seats, no food.  They catered to the Italians, so service was soso...I would hope it's just the week we went, so we didn't bother tipping.  Burger barn by the beach was the best - great fries and burgers.  Pizza joint at the other resort was good as well.  ACTIVITIES - snorkelling was the greatest, paddle boats, kayaking was fun.  We rented mo-ped for 14CUC for a couple hours and drove on the main road, nice drive.  We went;3
Went to Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales from feb. 3 to 10, beautiful weather hot hot hot , good resort for price, next time I would bring condiments to spice up supper or breakfast like little thing of peanut butter, jelly, mayo, bbq sauce, and ketchup. found the food a bit blah but I think you get used to it the hot dog near the beach are pretty good. If you are under 45 stay on the carisol side, los corales seem like an old age home (no offence). We meet this guy who lives up the mountain his name his arragnel just go outside the resort (carisol) first road to the left and ask for him, He will bring you horseback riding and ask him for the cascade (waterfall) he will bring you to them for cheap also dont do dolphin excursion ask to go with george he will bring you to the;4
This hotel may be a 3 star, but it was a 5 star in our eyes when it comes to hospitality!!  The Staff made us feel like we were long lost friends, and greeted us very warmly. We were there for 2 weeks, and the 1st week I spent ill with bronchitis, I was treated by Dr Marianno, who was fantastic, and looked after me, I couldn't have had better care, it was a great place to recuperate. Front desk staff were incredible, Marleidis, Anna, Willy, and everyone else I apologise for not remembering  their names deserve a medal, They are so patient with any problem, I work in customer service, and I believe, everyone should take lessons from these very professional individuals. The food is typical Cuban food, and again I never lost any weight while away. The rooms were great, our beds;5
My cousin and I just came back from a fabulous week at Carisol Los Corales in Santiago de Cuba.  I had done my research - lots of fabulous info on the forum and from the Destination Expert Coral Queen.  I like staying in 3 star resorts so you learn to expect the unexpected.  I am glad to report that everything ran smoothly...not a hitch....the weather was fabulous, basically 38 up to feels like 40 everyday!  not a cloud in the sky and usually a warm breeze.  We did have a couple of days that were quite windy but that was just perfect to go out on the hobby cat!  Captain Frank is AMAZING!!  he's really a one man show!  They do have two catamarans but unfortunately only one is operational.  Imagine how amazing it would be if both were working?!  I spent my last day on it - 5 rides;4
It is, probably, the most southern resort in Cuba, sitting on the Caribbean see shore in the mountainous region of Bocanao Park, about 50 km from Santiago de Cuba. Beside the beautiful nature (close mountain range, white sandy beach and coral reef in swimming distance), there are the very pleasant Cuban employees, who make this resort so wonderful. We were there already seven times and were always treated as almost the family members. Even if all those Cubans are very friendly, there are several of them who are really outstanding and truly make this resort so memorable. They are:   - Ana at the reception desk which with smile quickly and efficiently solves any arising problems,   -  Jacqueline in the charge of smooth run of the buffet restaurant,   -  Jacqueline in the open area;4
The rooms close to the beach are clearly destroyed from a hurricane and it didn't look like they planned to fix it. The resort looks old... BUT we had a blast. The place is cheap... if you're looking for a cheap place and going with a large group of people who enjoy drinking you can have fun here. Also the disco on the beach is pretty cool but, you need to pay for drinks even though the flyers + books say it's included. Animation team there's a couple real cool people on it that I think should work for a higher end resort because of their great personalities.   We also went off the resort on a horse and buggy for fresh lobster at a persons house. Was a scary experience but turned out amazing! And I'm definitely glad I did it because it showed the lifestyles of the people in Cuba;3
This was our 8th trip to Cuba and our first time at a 3 star resort.   After reading all the reviews on this site and communicating with some regular visitors to this resort we knew what to expect and were satisfied with our experience.  The cost and the people make this location very attractive.  We were interested in warm weather, which in January is not always the case on the north coast , a decent beach for swimming, snorkeling and a clean room.  We knew going in the food was the weakest link. This resort delivered all of the above.  We flew with SunWing and were happy with their service.  On time and pleasant. We stayed on the Corales side in block 200 and it was convenient to everything.  The entertainment stage is located in this area so not so good if you have small;3
"Hello; Our fifth time in Cuba and first time in a three star location after four star stays the previous three years. What we love, my wife and I, about the country is the people, genuinely friendly and helpful and this was no exception. Expect three stars service and food and you will not be disappointed.  To start with the airport, this was a long wait, the security service scans your carry on and checks your passports after the customs officers stamp the entry cards. Remember you have to prepare 25 CUC per person to exit Cuba. Do not exchange money at the airport, you get 70 CUC for CAN 100 and the resort pays almost 90 for the same.  The resort is about 50 Km from the Santiago airport and it takes one hour to get there. The area is hilly and the views beautiful driving the";3
Great value for money, especially as a single traveler, as long as you know what you are getting into.  Had some great experiences and met some great people - I love Cubans, they are so friendly.  Was made to feel at home, and never felt unsafe, which is important as a single young female.  The reef here is utterly amazing!  Have Noel take you out, he will show you the ropes.  We found sea urchins, lion fish, colourful fish, lobster, starfish, etc.  The resort is on a wildlife reserve, so there are packs of wild goats, horses, etc.  Great resort if you want something out of the city and and a bit more natural.  Loved all the space to go walking and swimming.  Great pool and swim-up bar.  Took a horseback ride for only 8 pesos up into mountain to check out waterfall - good trip.;2
Three of us travelled with Hola Sun on Canjet to Los Corales resort near Santiago de Cuba on January 9 for one week.  The flight seemed to be a little more cramped then other carriers  but when you  are on your way to a warm beach and a cold drink…all is good.  We arrived later in the evening  so the bus trip seemed longer as there was nothing to look at out the windows.  The hotel kept the dining room open so we could have a bite to eat when we got there.  Rooms were given out after everyone had finished.  The front desk staff were quick to give out the keys and get out luggage to our rooms.  The first room was fine but was on the first floor so we asked to be moved and were told that we would have to wait for the morning…no problem…next morning we were moved upstairs in the;5
Recommended by friends, the price was right at $412. taxes in for Jan 9th 2011. The hotel has issues but if you are a seasoned traveler to 3 star hotel in Cuba you will be fine. Definitely not for young 20 y old's who want to party, pretty far from the city ( 60 km) and not much happening at the time I was there.  Food, just horrible as always in Cuba, no pasta bar at dinner, just typical stew in the two buffets which serve the same food.  A la carte had lobster which was good. 4 or 5 bars, good service in general, tipping or not, great people except for one lady at the carisol buffet who disliked me from the minute she saw me ??? no reasons why... rooms were OK, free use of the safe, good beach, some young prostitutes with older guys, enjoyed the scooter for 2 days, put over;3
"After reading a lot of reviews with such a wide range we decided to take a chance and go for it. This was my 9th visit to Cuba, staying at a different hotel each time.  Being delayed for over an hour in Toronto didn't start us off to well. Just before we landed, our plane developed a water leak which cut out the computers, there was no danger, the pilot did a good job landing manually, some people say we were near to crashing  what nonsense. We were another hour late thanks to the incompetence of our tour guide Mario. I speak with experience as a previous Tour Director. He didn't even know how many passengers he had on his bus, and didn't  take us to our hotel because of other problems that he had, that he could have handled by phone. He was rarely arround the hotel"" I'm sure";4
Well I booked this trip with a friend for a week getaway this is my 3rd time to Cuba and by far the worst experience I have ever had, now in general Cuba is not for everyone but this spot really isnt for anyone. The service you recive is 100% on ur tip don't expect service if you don't tip and everytime, now I get tipping in Cuba but usually a peso is more then enough, also the bar that is supposed to be 24hrs is closed half the time and never open after 11 they always say they ran out of booze, now the truth is there filling up empty pop bottles of beer to take home also many of them will be serving tree Cuban buddy's and pay no attention to you.   The food was really bad at the buffet however if you go next door to the pizza spot it's awesome  The rooms were ok other then the;2
"Obviously from the wide range of reviews, this place is not for everyone. However, it certainly worked out very well for our family. And I think the main factors are 1) what your expectations are; 2) what time of year you go; and most importantly, 3) whether or not the resort's unique personality is a fit for who you are AND what you are wanting to get out of a Cuban vacation.   I booked this vacation months before Christmas because it was such a great price for travel during the holiday break period (we were there Dec 19-26.) There were 6 of us - my wife & me, my three young adult children & my eldest son's girlfriend. And then after booking, along came a streak of negative reviews in Tripadvisor and we became somewhat anxious about what to expect. I contacted ""Coral Queen"",";5
Just came back from my vacation two days ago. I went from December 9th until the 16th.  Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a resort for those used to the five star resort life style. If you go expecting 4-5 star treatment, you will be dissapointed. Keep in mind that this resort is located away from the main tourist destinations in Cuba and is very off the beaten path, that being said, it is, in my opinion more geared toward the recreational traveler.  Before I get to the Details you want to hear, remember to ALWAYS, ALWAYS research a hotel or resort anywhere in the world before purchasing your trip, or you may just of wasted your money at your own neglect.  I really didn't experience most of the complaints made for this hotel on here.  Also the Carisol side was close;4
That was my 12 time in Cuba.First time 3* resort.  We  had stayed before in Rio de Luna y Mares,Sol Sirenas,Brisas Santa Lucia,Melia Cayo Guiliermo,Playa Costa Verde. We paid $500 for a week tax included.Airlane with airport taxes around $300. for $200 left the resort done a great job.O.K.food is the same every day but we did not expect any better.It is a solid 3*resort,very clean,friendly.Good selection of international drinks,Spanish wine from the botteles at Lunch and Dinner.We left the tips.In our country we leave 10-15%. $5 Cuban peso a day for  those people who serve us with the smile I don't think is so much.Beautiful country side.Spent horseback riding 3-4 hour a day for $5/h.Ask for Jorgenis outside the Corales section .;3
Hello There, Just returned after 2 week stay at this place. Santiago is agreat place with a very nice scenaries of Mountain and Oceans but I guess I went wrong in Hotel selection, Carisol and and Los corales are two twin hotles under club amigo chain. Entertainment staff are very friendly but food and hotel sucks big time. Food is awful, thet have almost 95% same food in lunch and dinner and even in brakefast. If they try to anything diffrent like pizza they often run out in first one hour. Important things to know 1. They don't serve beer after 11 pm 2. They have a crappy disco on beach and you have to buy drinks even though it's all inclusive 3. Ala carte dinner is very very below average 4. Spider, flies, bugs can be easily seen in rooms 5. Toilet papers and Towels you got to;1
"We flew in with Sunwings from Montreal. Champagne on the way to Cuba but none on the way back. Sob! The check-in at the hotel was very fast. The room was clean, the beds a bit hard.  This hotel is located between the mountains in the front and the Caribbean Sea in the back. There were beautiful trees and the pool was nice. The food was good although repetitive. But it was better than we had expected. We were going for the sun and the warmth and we got blessed with beautiful weather. The sea was body temperature. There were always plenty of chairs all over. There were only about 80 to 100 persons at the hotel.   The Carisol section was closed so we were disappointed a bit. We had booked this hotel for the 1) price : 465$ per person; 2) the fact that we were getting two hotels";3
The hotel has a good location. The room was very clean, a bit noisy because of the entertainment. Food was not the strongest part of this trip. I eat better at other hotels same number of stars. Few choices, but I always enjoy going for the Cuban singers that entertained us during the dinner. This was very nice. Beach and pool were clean. Bar ok. Entertainment and the evening show is again a minus. The shows were boring. People from entertainment were sometimes too familiar with the tourists, and this became disturbing. Ana from entertainment was nice though. I played ping pong with her. Very friendly. Nice people at the reception desk, the lady (I don’t remember her name but was only one), George. Very friendly and helpful the Commercial director Neorvis.;3
Rooms were just okay....our toilet didn't always flush and the shower drain worked 20 minutes after our showers so you had to stand it the water the whole shower....strange...there is NO way were were that dirty so i'de say it backs up from other peoples. The whole week we only had hot water one day, and no hydro for the whole last day but we could still use the shower. Cleaned spotless & fresh towels everyday !  Food was okay for Cuba....warm most of the time but do not be late for meals or you will not get anything. Didn't gain any weight...yahh. Always fish, alot of roasted pork(yummy), rice, bread, squash, cheese slices, cucumbers and pickled beets. We had lamb one nite(i think) and liver to which both were great !! Omlets in the morning, but again don't be late. Ran out of;2
we booked this very cheap trip around 350 Canadian, taxes included and had minimal expectations. The rooms are decent, service is as one could expect in Cuba. The bars constantly ran out of beer, tequila, vodka.  The food was average and cold but passable.  The beach is a little rocky but there is some very good snorkelling.  Oct. is a little early so not everything is fully operational. There was less tan 60 guests and about 30% were singles with rental companions.  The Cuban government will have to decide whether to stay in the sex trade or curb it.  DO NOT take your family to this resort. Lots of men and women (mostly men) with their rental brides and other young girls around who are trolling.;2
Its sad to report that this hotel in the west of the island.. Santiago de Cuba is really a 1 star.The food is horrible.I go to Cuba often and I am telling you this from experience and not as a first time traveller.In general food  in Cuba is not great unless you go to the big city Havana.Being seen walking with a cuban female is a sin for the police.They will usually pull them over and give them lots of problems.The male workers are always looking to pick somebodies girlfriend when the boyfriend is not around.FORGET INTERNET IN CUBA...to hook up to internet it takes 5 minutes and is extremely slow.As far as using 3G cell phones your emails will not come in..you need to use older blackberry version telephones like 8310 as cuban technology can't support 3G .Iphone for emails;1
I booked this hotel because I needed a good deal and I was interested in going to a part of the island I had not visited yet.  I also had never traveled to Cuba at this time of year - August 29, 2010 to September 12, 2010.  The weather during my first week was hotter than I was accustomed to but as long as I could be by the water or get to my air conditioned room to cool off, I was O.K..  The water was HOT for about the first 4 days.  Then we had some rain (a storm that lasted about 5 hours) and it cooled down a little.  The weather also cooled slightly after that rain day.  I spent most of my time during the day at the beach because the pool was so over-crowded.  At this time of year, the hotel sells a lot of day passes to Cuban citizens.  The Cubans, almost without exception,;3
very clean everywhere, staff is friendly and give good service. Appreciate the countryside. Nice beach very warm water 27-30 celsius;4
I visited the Hotel Carisol last week with my friend , the best experience I had visitting the Caribbeean Area. This place with beautiful weather and gardens had a restaurant they called Ranchon , they offer cuban food everyday , chicken , pork , fish , salad , delicious fruit and icecream!!!!, we all love icecream. If you feel hungry you can have hot dogs at the same place in the afternoon, we also enjoy the pizzeria La piazza, not like in Italy but acceptable. Rooms were clean and confortable . We visited the acuarium and swan with the dolphins , what a great experience!!!!.the staff is just great , very nice people , cubans are always great . The beer was freezzing , so good . the beach is a little bit rocky, I think they should improve that .  I suggest this place if you;5
"We stayed at this resort from May 1 to the 14th, which is the low season where on average, there were 50-100 guests in total on the Carisol side (Los Corales was closed).  To start, I believe in the ""Law of attraction""! You get what you attract!  Recent reviews were complaining about the service and lack of management. The service for one was excellent! If you learn the names of the people that serve you and say please and thank you, you'll get a GREAT SERVICE. If you have no manners, well then, it's your own fault! I was disgusted by some tourists that think that for 600$ a week they can just expect to be treated like royalty! SHAME ON YOU! Learning a few spanish words would not hurt either, they offer Spanish lessons in the afternoon. If you do speak Spanish, which I do, it";4
If you like isolation, lack of shopping, biting insects, a small beach framed by limestone coral, a long trip by bus to santiago, birds flying over and around your dinner plates and buffet, and NO intertnet service, then by all means stay here. Entertainment was pretty good, especially the chap in the white outfit.;2
I dont know how many times i spend in this Hotel but it is always a pleasure to come back. I feel like in a family. Many people from  the Hotel are verry good friends of me. I enjoy always arround 3-4 weeks a year in the Hotel. I always travel with my little boy who is 5 years old. The people in the Hotel are really nice and friendly and do all that you will have a great time there. Food is good and the selection is big. Nobody has to starve. Never forget you are in a communist country Many people think they can have the same like in there home. Beach is small but verry nice. You dont need a big beach to relax and enjoy. A small place under a palm tree, in front the  sea and you will be happy. Sun is shinning, wind is blowing, music is playing and cubans are singing. Thats;4
Please please avoid this dump at all costs. We went down at Xmas and did not write a review but feel now that people need to be warned.It is at best a 2 star, a Cuban 2 star not North American 2 star. Don't worry about the food, they don't have much, in fact one night we went for supper at 8.00 pm in the Buffet and there was NO FOOD, not a bit of meat or fish to be found anywhere. My wife went to the A la carte next door and begged for a table which we did get. Oh on the subject of A La Carte, they have two, one is a Pizza and Pasta bar, worst in the planet, the other is the Seafood one down by the beach where everything is thrown in a deep fryer.This dump was on for $240 for a week at the end of April, it's not worth that, in fact I would never go there again even if offered;1
I went last March 2010 with my wife and another middle-aged couple for two weeks. I need to prefice this review with the fact that both my wife and I absolutely love Cuba (10 trips), and the Cuban people. My wife and I, have visited/stayed all around the island both in Cuban's homes as well as 2,3,4,&4.5 star resorts.  We are down to earth people, keeping  luxury expectations in check.   This resort has dashed any hopes for us returning to Cuba. The hotel room, grounds, beach, dive shop and the one a la carte restaurant were excellent. The fellows working in the dive-shop were very accommodating and their service level was the best I ever received in Cuba. The dive sites, except two, were pretty bad - nothing to see.  Aside from a few, very hard working Cubans on the resort, the;2
Where does one start we arrived on the25th of april and the night mare began.Before i get started we have been to Cuba 10 times .Ok ,The resort what a mess,run down management needs to be fired and replaced for not doing there jobs.The buffet was horrible the food was cabbage,rice bannanas fried,and what looked to be the spines of pig recooked over and over,the odd time they would bring out chicken .The biggest problem was that the kitchen staff would get there plates and take it back to the kitchen everyday.3-4 chickens roasted for the intire resort,not only that but a buffet i thought was what you wanted but they gave you your rason of food ..what they thought you should have snack bar no such thing,bars close at 11pm all of them.Breakfast was the best meal come on who can;1
"First of all, I have to advise that I have been to other Club Amigos many times  (Mayanabo and Marea del Portillo) and am aware that these are basic, clean hotels and provide value for your money.  Nothing prepared us for the two weeks we spent in this ""prison"". (I broke one of my own rules of not booking a 2 week vacation unless I had visited the place before for 1 week) The reason I did so was because of a recommendation from  friends and the Trip Advisor reviews  appeared good at the time.  Big Mistake!!  When we arrived at Santiago Airport a man carried our luggage a few feet to the bus.  We usually do our own luggage but he grabbed it very quickly.  Then when we told him that we had no pesos he said he would take Canadian.  Well I gave him a Loonie, (he was expecting to";1
Was not happy upon arrival , our hotel room was missing several things such as shower curtains, pillows, T V , fridge and blow dryer which we were told each room was equiped with . I can live without most of these things but besides that our sink was broken every time we used it the water would run all over the floor. My friends staying in the next room had several prolems as well. They did manage to fix all of these except for our sink... Food was very poor , looked like it was mostly leftovers most of the time . The staff werent very helpful , most of the time they looked at you and just nodded but did nothing. Our excursions that we book were the best thing of the whole trip , very cheap and had a great time on each of them . Entertainment at night was mediocore as well. If i;2
Our stay at the hotel was a terrible experience. The hotel was near closing and the visitors were being moved to the carisol (almost identical resort 100m down the road). the food was the same everyday and the staff was very rude. there were many locals walking around the resort, some offering sex for money others begging for gifts. we met 5 people that had their rooms broken into and had their stuff stolen. some had their shirts taken, others money. the security was very tight so it seems that the resort was stealing from their tourists.   there is no 24 bar as they advertise, the drinks cost 1CUC after 11pm. there is no fitness center or snack bar. there are no a la carte restaurants available.    we do not recommend the resort to families or couples looking to enjoy a;1
We stayed at Corales 04.04.10 to 11.04.10. . In the airport a bus driver of the coach extorted 5$ from each person for placing a luggage to the luggage area of bus.  Upon arrival to the hotel rooms were not ready so we just droped our stuff at room and went to lunch.  Food. We are very simple so we did not complain for the quality of the food. We got what we paid for. Anyway food was quite adequate and we even injoyed it in limited way. Leftovers are served next meal with some extra ingredients in it, hopefully if leftovers were served next day they were thermally processed. Waiter staff are courteous but take in consideration that they are so until you are in front of them. Their attitude to us (visitors) was visible when they thought that nobody saw them. We ordered wine and a;3
My partner and I spent a week here.  It was BEAUTIFUL weather and the resort was half empty....which meant that there was always a place to land on the beach or by the pool.  The staff were FABULOUS - helpful, friendly, and spoke half-a-dozen languages!  Every night at dinner they had a local band playing and they were all excellent.    The place is 1 hour from the airport (not 35 min) - but it's a beautiful drive.    The food was average - but I did manage to gain 5 pounds while away, so it obviously wasn't too bad (or maybe that was the Rum/Punches I was happily drinking). Breakfast was excellent.  This was the perfect place to go to sleep, enjoy the sun, meet some interesting folks (still waiting for John D's book), and generally relax.  If you're looking for wild times,;4
I went to this resort to get some sun and a rest.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  It was not very fancy but the grounds and pool were beautiful. I would go again in a minute.;3
We visited Los Corales from April 4 to 11th. This was our first time staying at a resort and as nature lovers our desire was to have an interesting place to explore, a comfortable room and decent food. I can honestly say that Corales delivered in all areas.               In terms of exploration there are lots of beautiful sights in this area. The beach does have rocks and shells but if you bring water shoes you can have tons of fun exploring. We spent at least a few hours each day snorkeling in and around the beach. In the grassy areas we saw spotted eels, tons of urchins (another good reason for shoes!) and even a puffer fish! Around the reef areas we saw a number of lion fish, a variety of coloured fish (yellow, electric blue, stripped, spotted etc), lobster and flounders. If;4
We looked at the past reviews before we booked and had an idea what to expect. It seemed that during less busy times the reviews were not favorable and that proved to be true in our case We went during the week of March 21st to March 28th and the hotel was mostly empty. The room was dated but clean as the previous reviews stated.  Broken toilet that would never stop running, very noisy AC and cold water for the first couple of days. Yes there were birds and cats in the restaurant but that didn't bother us, it's an outdoor facility and nature will come in.  The food for the first part of the week was very bad.  By bad I mean swarms of fruit flies sitting all over the salad bar and the fruits.  The food was constantly recycled from days before and mostly cold.  The bread was;3
We have been going to Los Corales for the past 12 years but this was our last time going. The place has gone down the tubes.  First when we arrived we were sitting in the lobby with no one around except for two workers. Mu mother forgot her wallet on the table when we left not even five mintues past and the wallet was gone. Not to be seen again. We looked everywhere.Made a report but after acouple of days the story from the lady at reception changed. So kiss any report down the drain.They could have done more about it. A lady lost her camera and they announced it at the show, So how come not with my mom's wallet which is a hell of alot more important. Shame on the person who took it and didn't return at least the papers and bank card that were in it. Thanks for making our;1
Went to this hotel during the March Break (march 14-21) with my husband and 2.5 yr old son.  Our first disappointment was to find out that due to the fact that the two hotels werent full they closed down the carisol side so we were limited to only 1 ala carte restaurant.  We booked this hotel because of the variety of the two sides...very frustrated by this on the first day.  We arrived on a Sunday and the food was crap.  It seems as though the standards drop on the weekends.  On Monday though, we were happier with the food.  There was much more variety during the week.  Also on the weekend the locals come and get better than the tourists I found....bartenders would spend minutes talking with the locals before serving the tourists....the cups were about a 6 oz cup at most so be;3
We were at the Corales for a week over the March break holidays. Our expectations were not high, as we knew we were going to a 3 star resort.   Good points: the large clean pool, wide beach with lots of chairs, great for sunlovers, food, nice staff. Kayak, canoe, snorkeling, etc is lots of fun.  Bad Points: Resort is in desperate need of repairs, hasn't been painted in many years, weeds everywhere on the grounds, birds flying in building where food is cooked and served, bird crap on the walls in the buffet area, front entrance yard is horrible (no appeal at all), old hard beds and pillows that give you that creepy feeling of bed bugs, grass doesn't get cut, very run down roof tiles and building structure. Not appealing to be living in for a week. Even the patio tiles were caked;2
"I stayed at this hotel March 07- March 13. It's a good overall hotel, food is good for 3 star resort in Cuba. Excellent diving places. Very experienced and helpful diving instructors.  And at the price 30CUC a dive is a steal. The location is ok too, about 60km from Santiago. The taxis to the city are not cheap however, around 30-40CUC one way. One word of advise, don't bring any gold items or relatively expensive watches, specially if you have partying to do. I accidentally  ""lost"" my gold chain after my first visit to the hotel disco the first night I arrived.";3
In summary, I think this resort is perfect for nature/animal lovers, down-to-earth people who aren't snobby and want to get to know the real cuba, people who are not picky eaters. I (24year old female) went with my mom from Jan 28th to Feb5th. I can honestly say that this was one of my greatest vacations (I've been to a total of 2 resorts in Cuba and 2 in Mexico), although the resort itself was the least fancy I have ever been to. The staff were amazing, weather was perfect and I learned alot of Spanish while there. If you are planning to go and are leaving from Hamilton/Toronto area, can you please send me an e-mail so that I can send a message to a friend there. It would be much appreciated!   CAUTIONS to the sensitive people: - there are wild horses, goats, cats, dogs running;4
"My boyfriend and I have just returned from a one-week stay in the beautiful mountainous province of Santiago de Cuba. I cannot understand the complaints I read on this site about the resort, the food or anything else (though I have to agree with alletas' review, just two reviews below this one... some of the tourists are just SO rude, I couldn't believe my eyes/ears!). The staff were generally very friendly, attentive and efficient (in a less-hurried, non-American way, of course!). Yes, sometimes a few members of the staff were perhaps a bit slow, or tired, but they work long hours, and most importantly, they have to deal with many rude tourists who constantly request this-and-that, complain (""there is no ketchup! oh my god, the horror!"") and NEVER leave a tip. Come on, the";4
"Myself and 4 friends aged 25 - 40 stayed here April 2008 and I was like we were stranded where we were not welcome.  Staff ignored us no matter how many times we said ""excuse me"". They allow locals in the resort on day passes and they run the place.  One of the days there were 2 couples that came and were having intercourse in the pool, in the broad daylight while we swam.  Staffers would not handle so we ventured down to the rough beach where there is a 10 foot area to swim, the rest is rock and weeds. The food was cold by the time the tourists got to it, staff ate first. Entertainment staff were nice... but all were owned by a few older ladies who they dined with each night so not like entertainment staff I've seen at other resorts that truly get the crowd involved.   We all";1
We usually don't write reviews, however, after our recent vacation experience, we thought we should write one. First of all, we went to Cuba from Feb.7-21 staying at Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales, which was a great resort.  My husband and I were there for one week and than his parents and sister joint us for the other. This was our second trip to Cuba, last year we stayed at a resort in Jibacoa. The area is poorer than Varadaro, but the mountains and the warmer water made up for that.  There are a lot of things to do as well, take a horse drawn carriage into the village and excursions into the mountains on horseback, rent a scooter and see the sights.  We could use both resorts, the Carisol and the Corales.  Both were fully staffed and had restaurants, stores, pools and bars to;4
"My family (my husband, myself & our 4 children aged 10-19 years), arrived at the resort (Carisol side) on Thurs Feb 11th at 11:30 pm. Approx 2 bus loads of guests were there to check in, yet the resort only had 1 person working at the reception desk, not a good start, and at that point we said okay things can only get better right?  ROOMS: We had booked 3 rooms; the lady said that we couldn’t get 3 rooms all together (2 together & other 1 couple doors down...and that was fine). Our rooms were in the 200 section. 1 room was great, had hot water, good ac & tv...2nd room had a toilet that wouldn't flush all the way (flush about 4-5 times before toilet paper would go down) a spider that looked like a  mini tarantula & huge cockroaches (both the size of a loonie...no joke!) no hot";1
A group of 15 (9, 45-59, 6 17-21 yo) just came home last night.  Most of the young ones said that this was the best week of their lives!  The week we were there, it was a spring break for a lot of Ontario Universities.  The 21 year old boys we were with were surrounded by beautiful bikini clad girls and couldn't have been happier!  Let me start by saying that of the older group, all of us are more use to staying at more luxurious resorts but we are all easy going and fun loving.    Food:  A la Carte restaurants are an improvement over the buffet but not always availble.  We never got into the Seafood Restaurant.  Breakfast was good if you like bacon and eggs and there was often delicious fresh orange juice.  Lunch and supper at the buffet were pretty similar every day.  Some;3
I was here for one week in Jan to Feb with my little baby boy.  Check in - was OK but it was only one person doing it and she try to be as fast as she could. Room - I was in the 400 block the room was very simple, clean and beautiful no complaints at all. I tip the maid everyday and it was always clean and tidy whenever I return after lunch or before. Food - simple but delicious I'm sure I gain some pounds LOL. Me and my friends that I gained simply couldn't believe how great the food was after some of the reviews on here I was expecting nothing great but the food blew my mind. We're all girls but just one taste at breakfast and we never missed a meal so basically all the restaurants at the resort was excellent unto this day I'm dreaming of the food!!!!!! Beach - simple but;5
My family had a wonderful two week stay at Club Amigo Carisol de Los Corales.  As we traveled out of Montreal we stayed in the Carisol side of the hotel. They seem to like to put the French in the Carisol and the English in the Corales (Two Solitudes?) I had read here that the Carisol wasn’t very good, but we were pleasantly surprised. The only drawback to the room was when we first entered it smelled very musty, but once the room was aired out it was fine. The ceiling in the bathroom also had a leak in it, but it’s not like we spent a lot of time in there so it was easy to ignore. Everything in the room worked - fridge,safe t.v. The electrical outlets were the old kind so leave the hair dryer at home or bring a converter.The cleaning staff were excellent. Having two resorts in;4
"I have just returned from my trip from Club Amigo; this is an honest review with regards to this hotel. I travelled with my wife and my 5 year old son; from Feb 4-11/10. Keep in my mind I got my trip for all 3 of us for a grand total of $1400 and change. We stayed at the Carisol side and in the room 507. Here are notes that might have already been mentioned from other reviews. Notes: -Safe door unhinge (repair man put the door back on but safe not functional through stay; nothing missing though but would have put my mind more at ease) -Balcony door cracked (the property is older and has seen it's fair amount of guest) -1 pillow per bed (after requesting additional pillows we were given the number we asked for) -Fridge is empty (they offer a VIP service of $10 per night were they";4
I have returned from a wonderful week at Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales, we stayed at Los Corales but honestly spent most of our days at Carisol. The Los Corales which is mostly for the older crowd (and i do mean older crowd) where the Carisol is for a younger group. With that being said the food seems to be much better at the Los Corales and we found that most people from Carisol came over each night for the buffet dinner. A la carte dinners were also very good, and they allowed us to dine at them more then once (Italian twice- delicious and the Grill twice). If you like lobster there is a lady who offers lobster lunch/dinner out of her house for 12.50 per person and a couple we met who dined there said it was great. The guest rooms are alittle dated, however we stayed in room;4
second trip to this resort and they have done alot of cleaning up with fresh paint  and repairs. The food had spices in it which was a nice supprise. Pool was spotless and the whole resort got new lounges and tables. beautiful area for walking dont be alarmed by the locals asking you for stuff just say no and keep going if you dont ave anything for them. if you take the scooters to the aquarium you can swim with dolphins for seven pesos( resort charges 35) everything is cheaper if you find your own way there!!! oh and rum is cheaper at the airport on your way out. This resort is very safe for kids and the security guards do a great job. Yes there are goats and horses wandering the resort freely and dogs and cats that show up at meal time(which irratated a few people) but this is;4
An amazing and ausom time.  Played the keyboard and got the Canad. Tourists up dancing, taking vids. etc. and had the time of my life.  The hospitality was excellent.  The food for that Hotel was o.k. with the resources they had and the manpower they had to work with.  The chef was great and deserves credit.  The musicians were spectacular.  The weather was hot after a cold two days but nothing we can do or control here.  All in all, a fun two week's vacation in the sun and water and the Cuban people are the most dynamic and electrifying people in the whole globe.  Had a great time and it went FAST.  TOO FAST.;4
Me and my partner stayed at Club Amigo Corales from Dec. 27-January 10, 2010.  It was the most fun ever.   We thought that two weeks would be too much time at one place but this one place is amazing!!  You cannot get bored about any of it.    The snorkeling was wonderful ..just be careful..there are many sea urchins..black and white with long prickly pins on them.  The beach at the front of the hotel is perfect for snorkeling but the local beach is better for swimming.  The local beach can be busy over the weekend but during the weekdays it's quiet.    The most wonderful thing to do at this resort is to take a hike in the mountain.   You take the road going up beside the Carisol section and there you will meet many Cuban folk that live in the mountains..we went for three-four;4
"My teenage daughters and I booked last minute for Christmas. We have been home now for 2 weeks and they are still saying it was absolutely the best Christmas ever and want to go back there next year!.  You will not find FINER STAFF anywhere. The beach is WONDERFUL . You never have to fight for a beach chair or shade.  We had no complaints about the food. Christmas dinner was, well ""I could not believe my eyes""!! You name it they had it. Two things which need improvement, the double beds were table top hard, but the extra single they gave us was fine and the girls were OK with the doubles. What I would do next time is bring a couple of those cheap air matresses from the Bargain shop use them and leave them. The other was NO coffee until 7:30am. I get up early, but it is all very";5
Summary: this resort is a solid 3 star for Cuba with standard Cuban food and drinks but the biggest selling point here ( and the reason we will return) is the weather !! In the high 30's every day and no rain. For more info and some tips to make the most of your stay please read on... We travelled to Los Corales Dec 27 - Jan 3 with a family of 12 (aged 12 yr to 78 yrs). We have travelled many times to Cuba including Manzanilla, Santa Lucia, Cayo Coco as well as other parts of the Carribean ( Mexico, Antigua, St. Thomas, San Juan, Costa Rica). I had researched this resort and we new what to expect. The resort was not even 1/4 full so we felt like we had it to ourselves. They just opened the week before we got there. The sister resort the Carisol also had low occupancy. We could;3
This had to be the greatest time i have had in forever.. The people were amazing, from security, to the dj's. I have never met better people in my life. We made so many new friends and we are goin g back for the bartenders birthday...(enuale). The food was good, and the live entertainment during dinner was phenominal. The late night shows were a sight to remember... from the dancers to the aquatic ballet... and the comedy skit put on by the staff was gut busting funny, Even though there was not alot of people my age the locals would come and dance with us at the disco, and once word spread about how much fun we were having , then the crowd came ... I could go on forever about how great it was but i think you need to find out for yourself. and remember it is oonly as fun as you;5
My first trip to cuba, and perhaps the best vaction I have ever had. The resort was beautiful and the staff were amazing, making sure we were well taken care of and always having a good time. If you socialize with the people and take advantage of all the activities offered I promise you will enjoy your stay. My whole family loved it and we all plan to travel back as soon as possible. We made lots of new friends, and learned a lot from the experience. Food was great and always a huge selection. For all the negative reviews you see, you have to remeber that you only have as much fun as you allow your self to have.;5
I booked a vacation package with your company on April 5, 2009 to April 12, 2009 in Santiago de Cuba at the Carisol  Resort. My holiday was RUINED for a variety of different reasons:    1. There was livestock running throughout and defecating on the resort 2. The mattress and the sheets were bloody  3. A hotel representative told me he would NOT eat the food on the resort and that we  4. should not either.  5. Grass on the resort was all burnt brown - no green gras. 6. One half of the resort was closed for no apprent reason 7. The beach was filthy. 8. Most of the resort staff were fairly rude and unpleasant   As a result we had no other option but to LEAVE this resort and go to another hotel, Brisas Sierra Mar. However, before we could change resorts we encountered additional;1
"Yes, there are animals on the resort, yes, the food in the resort is not Canadian 5 star, but once you have actually lived in Santiago city and only found crackers and beer to live off of, you realize the resort is providing the best it can...and let me say after the going to the city for a week I sure would have loved the resorts meal. What do they say, ""When in Rome!"". Cuba is not like other counties, lets get that straight. I have been there three times in less than a year. Yes you go because it's cheap, so don't expect 5 star...but you don't go there for the food, nor the resort, nor even at times the beach, but for the people of Cuba. A friendlier, safer place I have never found. Made some great friends from there and from all over the world. I have gone off to the night";5
This resort is incredible - good service, amazing rooms, pools and beach! Went with my boyfriend and had a great time. Weather in April was perfect and activities on site were all-around good. Suggestion: Take a day trip - We went with the boat, snorkling, lunch and into the city and was worth it for sure!;5
I could write a novel about my trip to Santiago de Cuba, and more specifically, my stay at this place. Let me first state that for a last minute deal of less than $700, taxes included, it was more tropical and more affordable than spending a week in Toronto at Aunt Betty's house.  Now that the positives are out of the way, let me say what you really need to hear, from absolute worst to bad. I heard the food was bad in Cuba, even from people going to 5 star hotels. This food was like eating dog food. I had sliced cabbage every day for lunch and dinner, and the cabbage had no dressing on it.  The staff are unhappy, ask you for belongings from the day you arrive, to the day you leave. I can handle peddlers on my last day of my trip, but from day one - forget about it! One bartender;1
For the price this is probably the best bet for Santiago beach hotels. I have been to this hotel more than once.  THE FAT - this complex was once divided into 2 separate hotels. A major plus for going there now is that you have access to both hotels meaning use of both pool areas, all restaurants (5), all bars (7), lobby lounges and nightly entertainment shows. Not all the bars and restaurants are open at the same time though. The beach although not comparable to Varadero, Trinidad or Holguin is very good for Santiago beach standards. There is also a local beach right beside the Los Corales section where you can swim, sunbathe and mix with Cubans. The nightly shows feature dancing, fashion, comedy, magic or aqua ballet depending on what is scheduled. In high season there usually;4
my 1 week stay went from bad to worse! upon arrival we met another couple who said they were very disappointed & were leaving the resort to eat & drink.nothing was open so we thought it would be better the next day.all inclusive meant be there at opening, because when its gone, youre out of luck.rum is my drink of choice,but i couldnt drink their rot gut  rum, had to settle for their beer flavoured water. staff was ok considering what they had to work with,maids were great but security were terrible.having said all this, i believe the main reason for the splotchy amenities, was, we found out on day 3 of our trip,that the resort was closing for the season on the day we left which explained why supplies & fun dwindled as the week progressed.I WOULD URGE ANY FELLOW TRAVELLERS TO;2
FOOD:  i stayed away from the buffet and never went to the seafood restaurant.  i also never went to breakfast but i heard the omelettes are great.  every day for lunch i ate a hotdog and fries at the beach restaurant.  really good fries.  for dinner every night i ate pasta and pizza at los corales. my friend would get pizza and i would get pasta and we would split. it was good and its made personally for you. no food is 24/7. i believe there is no more food after 8 pm (or some time around there).  NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT: there is a show every night with the dancers. except for 2 nights, 1 where they had water ballet in the pool and then another night it was a magician. i only saw the entertainment on the corales side. it was fun to watch and the dancers were good. some nights are;4
This was a fantastic vacation for the down to earth typed person.  I can see why Posh uptight people complain.  If you want a Hilton or a Riu go there.  This Resort is not very fancy but is beautiful.  I travelled there with two friends for one week.  It is low season for them so there were not very many guests and the age groups were 15-18 and 40 plus.  Us being mid-twenties we were a little out of place.    The Corales side was closed which was disappointing but when we walked over there and saw the damage from hurricane season we were glad were not on that side.    THE ROOMS are big and kept very clean.  Our chambermaid was very nice and we left items out for her everyday.  Just leave wahat you want to give on pillows.  There were very few mosquitos  or any insect.  THE;4
"This was our fourth time visiting Santiago de Cuba with Sunwing and staying at the Club Amigo resort, although the first time at the Carisol side.  We always thought the Carisol side was where some Canadian groups (not to be mentioned) were put due to their major complaining and locust-like behaviour at the buffets but this was the side that was open this visit so we had no choice but to stay here.  To our surprise, it was quite acceptable.  The rooms were larger in size, although balconies were smaller and the overall appearance of the property was more updated than the Los Corales side.  The bathrooms were updated and our shower had a massaging showerhead; there was a screen on the bathroom slatted window (Los Corales side did not) to prevent mosquitoes from coming in.  The";3
We have been choosing a resort for our family (two adults and two kids) for a week getaway. We decided try the Santiago de Cuba area recommended by others for it’s beautiful dry weather and close locations to several tourist attractions. After spending some time reading reviews and checking prices with several Toronto travel agencies, we decided to book our vacation trip to Club Amigo Carisol los Corales through Red Tag, Hola Sun for last week of March. The description read that the resort had two separate hotels with bars, restaurants, pools etc. and we would be using both facilities with access to all amenities.   When we got off the bus and began to claim our rooms, a shocking statement was made by hotel staff was that the Los Corales resort is closed as well all facilities;1
It was a experince that we won't forget . We ran out of water for two days and had no electricity in your room for 15 yours . The beach was the worst i have ever seen . They ran out of beer and coke and one night even rum.The 24 hour bar close at 11:00 pm every night just as well no booze. The pool was great and the friends that we met were fantaastic so that made the trip eveen better,thank god for good friends. The staff there was also very nice they couldn't do enough for you .There was horses and goats even cows it was like being at a farm and there was alot of what goes with them.The birds in the dinning area was just awful they were on tables and at the buffet there was dropping everwhere. Good Luck if you decide to go.;2
"Well im siting in front of my computer trying to think of a way to some up our vaction to club amigo los corales the only word that comes to mind is "" CRAP "" . from the time we arrived the halosun rep was trying to take advantage of people by over charging for excurtions around the resort at least by double.Then we entered the room yes clean but old bed frames broke,lamp shades hanging off lamps. The beds were extra firm .The shower head was rusted to the point no water would come out.There was half of shower curtain so water was on floor. There was never toilet paper around the resort so you had to carry a roll with you when you left your room.The padio door handle was broke off and someone shoved toilet paper in the hole to prevent bugs from coming in.This was the";5
Wednesday March 11, 2009 After work, I picked Lynda up and we headed off to Toronto, after stopping at Siem Reap (or Seam Rip, as Paul calls it) in Kingston for supper.  Lynda was in charge of all the non-driving related car dials, such as the heater, mp3 player, ceiling light, and seat adjustments.  At one point I was scowled at for overstepping my bounds when I infringed on her territory and changed the radio station.  In retaliation, as a punishment, she put the left turn indicator on.    We arrived at the Belaire Hotel at 10:00.  For $97.00 they provided us with 2 weeks parking (we only needed a week), a nice room and a free shuttle back and forth to the airport.  We celebrated our vacation in our room with some mini bottles of Bailey’s that Lynda brought along.  Already I;3
I just got back from staying at this resort (Mar 26-Apr 2). I was in Santiago de Cuba last year, and stayed at Club Bucannaro, so I did not have high expectations of the area. I know it would not have been great, considering the cost, however, this even fell below my expectations. First issue was that for the first two days I did not have water in my room. I was lucky I could flush my toliet at times and had cold tap water, but now shower.  They did give out bottled water.  I also lost power in my room for a few hours the first day. (I noted that a previous reviewer had the same problem the week before I went). I also experienced the resort running out of beer and coke on a daily basis. Also the so called 24 hour bar closed between 10:30pm and 11pm everynight. Then the had;2
Okay so first of all, I don't know why so many people are complaining about this resort. I went with one of my girlfriends Feb 12-19th 2009 and we had a wonderful time. Keep in mind it is a 3-star resort!!  Arrival: We left Toronto at 630 am with Sunwing. I highly recommend Sunwing by the way, Pablo, the sunwing rep at the resort was awesome! When you arrive in Cuba either carry $5 bills or exchange many at the airport right away and ask for small change. As you walk out of the aiport towards your bus, your bags will get torn out of your hands and they will then expect a tip, therfore carry small change, and they will not take canadian coins. Arrived at corales side at noon, received a complimentary drink as we got off the bus, and got our room key right away. Staff was friendly;4
Food was horrible, ran out of beer every day by the afternoon, we had to buy a case of beer outside the resort one night. Horse and goat crap everywhere. Very dangerous walking due to hazards and limited light at night. Seafood al a carte closed mid week without warning, they are rationing beer and giving it to specific people only, we ended up giving away clothes to get special treatment at the bars. We feel sorry for the staff here as this resort will end up out of business without serious changes. If it wasn't for the great friends that we met from Kingston and Tilsonburg then the week would have been absolutely awful. Ran out of water the last three days - deplorable conditions!;1
I traveled with 5 other people that stayed in the Los Amigos side of then had friends book separately and stayed at the Los Corales side of the resort. The 6 of us that stayed in the Los Amigos side got 2 rooms (both with 3 beds - which was a great surprise). These rooms were also adjoining which made it a little easier to keep track of everyone and designate one person with the room key!   First off I should say the airline was AWESOME. I have flown to 14 different countries - backpacking and staying in hostels. The attendants were friendly, funny, and helpful. The food was good (i was surprised there was even a breakfast on a 3 hour flight), earphones were included, a movie was played and baggage was quick to be received at both our destination and depature point (a little;3
just came back from here and would not go back. The hotel ran out of beer  and coke all the time. the food was nasty lots of cats and birds eating off the tables. the rooms were very clean the houskeepers did a very good job. The staff were also very good.  We had no water the last 3 days of ot stay so it got pretty bad in the toilets. People were washing in the pool. We were eventually given 1 bottle of water per room on the 2nd day.  We talked to people who were going there for years and loved it until this stay so we don't know why it was so bad. It was the end of the season and the staff were taking home the alcohol and the food. We were hasled by locals every time we went off the resorts for our clothes. It is very poor there and we felt very bad for the people. the Hola;2
We spent a great vacation at Club Amigo. Los Corales. I never went to the sister hotel  Carisol. The beach is very natural with lots of palm trees. There is a lot of space on the beach so it is easy to relax and even sleep through the afternoon without being disturbed. The hotel is about 50min bus ride from Santiago in the country side, which makes it a great space to explore Cuba without meeting large groups of tourists everywhere you go. The hotel offers a number of excursions, most of which cost about CAD 40. We visited an artist village, hiked at la Gran Piedra, went to the zoo, went to a snorkeling excursion and to Santiageo and went horseback riding in the country side. All excursions were great and well organised, but noteworthy was the excursion on horseback, which led;4
"Food: limited choice and variety, wines watered down, run out of orange juice and wines very frequently. Noticed that the staff help themselves before the guests can even start!

"I went just before March break and I got a really good deal- so it was worth the price. The beach was good. They was a nice place to swim. They are a few rocks but not at the center of the beach. We even went snorkelling on beach. Most equipment on the beach was free to use for the day.  The food was okay it was a repeat at times-  but we tried different things ..the beach place for lunch and dinner al-carte. Also a Italian al-carte for dinner. So if you like hot food; bring some hot sauce...or any sauces you like from home. One day they roasted a whole pig that was really good. We also adventured and went for Lobster Dinner at Bacano at someone's house it was great- Huge lobster for 10 peso. Amazing experience take a few things and give out in village.

We are just back from Carisol Hotel Club Amigo. We spent a week between March 4th and 12th. LIke a lot of people we had read reviews and didn't expect much. We had made reservations for 3, and I was already contemplating sleeping in the same bed as my 6 ft tall son :( But the minute we got to our room Ana, the maid, called for help and they installed a 3rd bed for us :) :) This was off for a good start!  The beach was fine, the sand is a little dark but it's still very nice. There are only a few areas were it's only sand, the rest of the beach has spots with sea weed but there's still lots of room for those who want to swim without the felling of weed under your feet. I like snorkeling and was not disappointed, it was my 6th or 7th time I was doing it, so I'm not an expert but;4
We were there for 1 week from Sun Feb 22-March 1st.  Went with my 11 yo son and my Dad. The dates and price were the main reason why we booked and we weren't expecting a lot based on reviews read on this site.  Our room was average.  Old but clean and with no problems. Air conditioner worked great, infact too cold sometimes and we had to shut it off.  When I booked I thought I would have to share a bed with my son, but to my great surprize on arrival my Dad, my son and I all had our own beds.  The food was fine.  We don't expect a lot when we go to Cuba.  Always found something and never went hungry.  They have cappucino at the pool bar which was lovely and the drinks we had to wait for but we were on holidays and brought our big mugs so we didn't have to go up as often.  The;3
Stayed at this resort the end of Jan. beginnning of Feb. for two weeks.  Weather was excellent (no snow to shovel).  The resort is old and needs work but was fine.  Food was usually cold but edible.  My wife is a picky eater and she did not go hungry.  Coffee at the pool bar was excellent.  Snorkelling was good.  The Beach Grill and Pizza restaurant were both excellent.  Food at these places was hot and delicious.  The beach was rocky  but lots of chairs.  No need to stake one out early each morning.  The only problem was the resort was catering to large groups and these groups would hold large tables in the main restaurant and at times there were no tables to be used but these were empty.  You also had to be creative to get a reservation at the beach grill or pizza restaurant;3
My friend and I always come up with the most spontaneous and random travel adventures. Usually we go on roadtrips, camping at various parks on the way to our final destination to lower the cost but back in November we decided that this year we would celebrate Reading Week in style.  Since we are both university students, money is never in abundance and so we set out to find an affordable vacation that would meet our standards. First off, I must say that reading travel reviews online is essential to having some idea of what to expect when you arrive at your destination. However, keep in mind that to certain things, particularly food, people have many different reactions. My advice would be to keep an open mind.  After reading many reviews and searching the net for photos, we;4
My girlfriend and I have just returned from two weeks at the Los Corales. We are very pleased with our holiday and would recommend it very highly. We would suggest the following: If you have a choice, fly down with Sunwing as opposed to TransAt. Fly directly into Santiago de Cuba and avoid the 3 hour bus ride from Holguin. The food on AirTransAt was terrible, so if you don't have a choice, bring your own packed lunch and buy water on the other side of security. Be aware that you are not allowed to bring laptops into Cuba, so save your fellow-passengers waiting-time upon arrival!!! The exchange at the moment is about 71 pesos to $100 Canadian. We suggest you buy the Serrano brand coffee (ground or in grains) at the airport's Duty Free shop. It's less expensive than at the hotels.;4
The pools were great, so were the acivities at Los Corales. Even though the hotel was at three stars, it needed more work as to maintenance, because there were problems in the rooms. WE had stayed at Carisol. The food was neutral (i was a picky eater and had only fish wish will last me for a whole yr). Our flight bac to Ottawa was delayed several times. I wish they would have had more activities for kids.;3
"All-in-all I got what I paid for...under $1200 for 2 people taxes included, for 1 week.  I am not a picky traveller, somewhat the ""roughing-it style"".  The hotel was older and ruined by a couple bad storms.  The staff continue to manually clean the beach by hand and repair the buildings.  The Beach: - Is not the best, the sand is coarse and full of broken shells and coral, water shoes or sandals are a must.  The swimming area is small, because there is a lot of seaweed, rocks and sea urchins. + Lots of loundge chairs, snorkelling equipment, paddle boats, catamarans.  Resturant, Bar and toilets close by. Lots of trees. Great snorkelling! Lots of coral and fish of all kinds! The fish LOVE bread and boiled eggs, bring a water camera! The trick to having a leak-free snorkelkling";3
This is a place to vacation. Wonderful staff.   Our room was very clean on the ground floor with a walkout veranda and a view of the big pool and beautiful grounds.    All of our meals were perfect. You may also enjoy their adjoining hotel for their food and pool etc.   The snorkeling was so beautiful, just like in a movie.  The shows were very entertaining, clean and fun.  The disco was fun. We met a family with 3 children and they were also welcomed at the disco. Good clean family fun.;5
Booked this resort based on research of other resorts in the area and chose Santiago because of the location, mountains and old city nearby for tours.    Airport is fine. Money exchange out the door to the right, time enough to get money changed before bus leaves. Rate at my time was about $1.35 for 1CUC, slightly better than at hotel.    Arrival at hotel was good. We got placed in Carisol which we were not too sure about, again based on reviews but after a day and looking place over it was fine and at the end of trip I actually preferred where we were. We went directly to room within 5 minutes but they were in the process of being cleaned so we changed into suits and went for a swim, had a bite to eat and went for a walk.    Our initial impression was not good as we arrived at;2
Stayed 2 weeks, have been to several other Club Amigo resorts and am quite satisfied with 3 star resorts as far as comfort, food and entertainment.  Loved the area on the southern coast.  Vegetation quite different from the north coast.  Went to the Tropicana cabaret in the city.  The fine white beach sand has been washed away by recent hurricanes but still quite nice, lots of trees for shade.  Enjoyed the evening entertainment and the musicians at dinnertime, quite a variety.  Not much action at this resort, most of the guest are there to relax, (maybe the disco at night is lively but did not venture out to see).  Staff are very nice and always asking if everything is okay and if you are enjoying yourself.  All in all it was a very nice stay.  Would return here another time but;3
This resort is rated a 3 star. It was my first time out of Canada, so I didn't have much to compare it to. We booked with sell off vacations 7 months prior, and paid $1000 all inclusive, however last minute you can get it for $600-700 AI My experience overall was great.  We had a group of 18 travelling together, and the service and staff were very accomodating. ROOM:  I had no problems with the room in terms of bugs, I was on the 2nd floor, but I do know that some of my friends on the 1st floor did get alot of ants, and changed rooms.  I was without water completely for about 4 days in total (Mostly at night though) FOOD:  There isn't much variety in the buffet, and only one A La Carte Restaurant. The food is average. Rice, pasta, beef, chicken. Be careful that the chicken is;3
We just returned from a one week trip to Club Amigo Carisol/Los Corales and loved our stay. Jan 8 - 15. Sunny and over 30+ every day!!  The resort was well equipped, the staff were great (except the daiquiri bar - where all of the staff at that bar were notably aloof and uninterested and constantly messing up orders), the food at the buffet was quite good, the weather was to die for, and the drinks were strong.  We spent a lot of time researching destinations and packages and decided to give this resort a try. As per several recommendations, we specifically asked to be booked at Los Corales as opposed to Los Carisol.  Our visit exceeded our expectations based on the reviews. SunWing was quick and efficient to get us from  Ottawa to Santiago de Cuba and then from the airport to;4
Stayed second week of January 2009 with a friend. Been been to Cuba several times before although not to this area...which seemed alot more in need of the neccesities ( ie. shampoo, toothpaste, makeup, lotion, etc. for the staff) than anywhere else I have been.  Food was okay but if you are a picky eater......dont even bother. You probably wouldnt find much to eat other than rice, fries(when available) and chicken ( check to make sure its actually cooked). Like most people said, food is left uncovered, so my suggestion would be to go right at lunch, and dinner before the flys get to walk all over the food ( or birds get a chance to pick at it). Not a big assortment of fruite ( but it is January, technically thier winter month, so understandable). If you are looking for coffee,;2
We stayed at the Club Amigo Los Corales near Santiago de Cuba from 25 Dec 2008 to 1 January 2009. We had a choice of staying at either the Los Corales or the Carisol section which had just opened but selected the former.  On the whole, both are comparable but we found the Los Corales section somewhat better.  The nationality of guests included Western and Eastern Europeans and Canadians.  There was the inevitable underlying tension between Canadians and those Canadians who would prefer to be independent.  The beach is pretty good (sand fleas were very annoying for some) and the water level is fairly shallow out to the offshore reef.  The fact that the resort still has a beach after a series of hurricanes has either removed or reduced the beach at other resorts along this stretch;3
We just returned from a wonderful week At Los Corales in Santiago, Cuba. Considering the turmoil Cuba has went thro with the hurricanes this past season, Los Corales had survived quite well. While we were there Dec 11-18th, we totally enjoyed our stay. Carisol was not open as yet & Los Corales was about 1/3 booked. They are expecting a full house for the Holiday Season & 50th Anniversary Revolution Celebrations. Carisol will open on Friday 26th to take the overload. Some of our favourite staff were not working as yet, so we made other arrangements to visit them. We took many gifts for all the staff, as well as the locals. We took the horse & buggy ride to Bacanao Village (2 CUC's each way), and gave out goodies to the locals there as well. Everything we gave out was well;5
We went to this place for two weeks in Dec. 2007. Carisol section was closed and we stayed at Los Corales. I have to say that the hotel, food and service were OK and completely acceptable for the price we paid. We went to enjoy the sun, beach and scenery and that was Awesome. It could always be better but I can not complain. If you are looking for a peaceful time this is a Great Place!!!  I won't go back because we always go to a different place.;3
We ( my girlfriend and i) stayed at C.A Carrisol Corales for one week in the month of april.......April 29 to May 6 to be exact. We payed about $1200 for the two of us through a local travel agent. For $1200 this resort was great. The Staff was friendly and everyone on the resort were great. The food was fine, but dont expect the best. Theres a bunch of tours you can do.....We did the horseback riding up the mountain to a waterfall....alot of fun.The only bad part of this resort in my opinion was the bartenders.....if you aint single prepare to wait at least 5 min to be approached ....The beach had alot of shells and the water was very shallow.... the water was very warm( wear water shoes). We are in our early 20's and i must say we had a great time.!!!!!!!!!;3
We just returned from the Carisol Los Corales. We spent a week there from April 17 to 24 th.  We booked through Sunwing.  We had excellent service with Sunwing, nice flight + meals while traveling.  The bus ride from Santiago airport to this resort is 1 hr. Please note that there is no toilet paper at the airport...and sometimes not restrooms in the buses.  So think about this if you are traveling with children. After the 1 hr bus ride through the countryside we arrived at the Carisol Los Corales, which is directly on the beach.  These are two resorts side by side.  However, only the Los Corales was open when we were there.  This hotel is quite big.  The pool is wonderful, huge and very clean, with a swim up bar.  We were greated by wonderful staff and musicians (and a welcome;3
I went to Cuba 3 times, always in a 3 star resorts and will be going shortly. I found the reviews very helpful every time and decided to write some tips. We (3 girls in 20’s) went to Los Corales in 2005 and had a great experience for 2 weeks. Food was good for the 3 star, however if you are too picky, I would suggest to go for 4 or 5 star. But for the money you pay, is amazing. Staff, resort, entertainment, rooms, etc. for a 3 star resort was above average. There is always going to be something that is missing or not the way you expected, but hey, it is Cuba, we have to be a little bit more empathetic and see the world and things around us from their standards of life. I would suggest reading all the reviews and being optimistic. Do not go to 3 star resorts if you are looking;5
"April 10th to 17th / 08 ($558.00 AI) Sunwing Vacation Package  What can I say that others have not already said;   Location / Location / Location; it was an amazing / outstanding experience.  The resort is indeed a solid 3 star resort, a very standard property for Club Amigo;  Resort facilities; The Carisol side was closed during our stay, so we were situated on the Coralas side / Power shut down twice for a matter of one minute; no big deal, it’s expected.   Standard very clean room; comfortable beds, some may think they are too hard, but we had no issues, clean bathrooms, never ran out of hot water, mini fridge in room, small 14” TV, in wall A/C work perfectly, in closet safe (punch code) key access for doors not time lox cards as on most resorts, we received amenities daily";3
It is late March in Montreal and the radio announcer has just announced that it is minus 20 and who can forget the record mounds of snow. If you are not a skier then Viva Cuba! Why? Sun , beaches and a lot of nice people. Need a better reason?  Again, we must caution travellers that Cuba is not a good destination for everyone. It is funny how we hear the same old complaints so, when will some people finally learn?  In several previous reports, we have listed factors one should consider before booking a Cuban getaway. Many others have also tried to make these very same points. The information is there so, why are people still taken by surprise? We do appreciate constructive criticism that helps us make better decisions since we seldom return to the same resort . We prefer to;3
Just got back from Santiago and the trip was amazing the weather was perfect the ocean was warm and the list goes on. The hotel staff were wonderful we met many new friends and had a great time. We had a really nice pool front room that was kept really clean. For the price of this resort I would definatley recommend it for a 3 star it was very good value.;5
Our first time in Cuba and will not be our last. We stayed at the los Corales from feb 28th to march 12th, I can honestly say with no complaints at all, apart from a group of italians that were there our first week. They were really rude and overbearing not only with the patrons but with the wonderful staff at the hotel, I must say the staff handled it with such diplomacy, whereas my travelling companions and myself were just disgusted by them.The rooms were spotless, the food was great, good beach wonderful entertainment and again the staff I can't say enough about them what a lovely group of people.If you want a excellent mojito go see Joanna in the lobby bar she makes the best!Can't wait to go back next year to continue building wonderful memories of cuba;5
Just back from Carisol, stayed March 5-12, 2008.  Flew Cubana with my husband (50's) and girlfriend and her 3 sons ages 10-12-15, she's 40's.    Flight: Cubana, great going out of Montreal, not crowded, served a salad with chicken, good service. Returning? crowded, hot and stuffy, served a 'snack' of bread roll, mini potato salad & cookie, it was dinner time and nowhere to buy real food... take something from hotel or you'll be hungry,  poor service.  Rows 9,10 11 seats do not recline but have extra leg room.   Carisol: I think it's all been said, but this is the most recent as I was just there.  Hotel is a Cuban 3 star therefore food and service is average for Cuba. We decided that lunch is the best meal as it comes hot (if you order pizza) go to buffet for salad or pasta if;4
My stay was Feb 25 to March 5, 2008.   I stayed at the Carisol.   There are 2 hotels (Los Corales & Carisol)    Los Corales has more to offer in terms of Banking & doctor, etc...  It is only a 2 min walk between the two hotels, and I enjoyed my stay at Carisol.   Power shortage seems to happen often (at least every 2nd day I was there) and from what other people have told me , Los Corales did not have a generator.    At Carisol, we had a generator.    NOTE:  Bring a flash light ! Weather was amazing, very hot 34 degrees plus Beach was great, (they received a shippment of beach chairs the wk I was there, so the problem with the beach chair war is over) Do not bother to use Loonies or Toonies there (they can not do anything with them, you cant even exchange them at the bank) Bring;4
"This was my first time in Cuba and I  was blown away, from flight approach, to 1.25 hr commute from the airport through the Cuban country side, and to the resort.  I was placed in the Carisol side; and it seemed like there was preferential treatment to those who stayed on the Los Corales side... Los Corales definitely had the better of the two in terms of rooms. Bigger patios/balconies, etc.  But otherwise, no matter where you were staying, you were able to any of the facilities that both resorts had to offer (ie: you could eat at any of the restaurants, use any of the pools, etc).  Most of your time is spent outside of your room anyway!  I had a bit of an ant problem in my room, but it wasn't terrible... Just make sure all food items are stored away and sealed properly.  I was";4
We stayed at the Los Corales section of this resort as a family of five,three children, 10,11 and 12 and  all  enjoyed ourselves. We had chosen this resort after reviewing comments on this site and were well rewarded with our choice of resorts. The Corales section has mainly older tourists with the younger set being at Carisol . Downfall for the kids is that there was only one other child at the resort  close to their age at the time of our visit, but that could be due to not going during march break. The staff on the resort were wonderful and do a wonderful job despite how little they get paid. My youngest child had birthday while we were there and the staff went beyond with what I expected in celebrating her birthday. Its nice to bring down items to be able to give to the;4
I got a lot off this site so I figure i should give some in return and write a review. I was at the carisol Los Corales from Jan.31st to Feb 7th. A lot was said in the last 3 reviews but I will try and add more. I have been to Cuba 3 times so I have somthing to compare it to.  I was on the Corales side. You get to use both hotels. The room was fine. We had a clean comfortable bed, a working toilet... and a shower. That's all I ask for. I thought the air conditioning was kind of a joke. It was just a big hunk of metal making lots of noise. We turned it off and had the patio door open all week and it was ok. No bugs, no mosquitoes, no ants inside. We had hot water at any time excpet that one afternoon where it was luke warm. They don't supply face cloth. This side of the hotel;4
We stayed at the Carisol from Jan.24 'til Feb.1. I pretty much agree with the last 3 reviews on this site.Our experience was nothing but possitive,starting with the arrival at the hotel. The staff at this resort will go out of their way to help you with anything.Now let me put down my impression of this resort: The resort itself could use a bit TLC but the main thing is that it is very clean and the rooms are surprisingly large.It is located between the beautiful mountains and the ocean.  The water is heated by solar ,that's why the showers are cold in the early morning but you'll get a nice hot one in the early afternoon....just something to consider.. The food was good and there was always something to choose from....I had no idea that you can do so many different things with;3
Los caroles, cuba, we just returned from los caorales we were there from Jan. 24, to Feb.7, and had a wonderful time, ok where to start. Upon arrival  we were greeted and given our rooms, went very smoothly. beautiful resort but could use some TLC to give it a boost. Rooms very clean and  large but again could use some fixing but how time do really spend our rooms not much.Beach very nice  water absolutley beautiful warm , warm warm, but water shoes are a good idea there are patches of grass, but you can see the areas where to swim water very clean and clear, the best part for us, love the beach althought its a wee bit rough from the hurricanes  so it has taken a beatten. Snorkelling FANTASTIC, and our friends one of whom is a diver went diving everyday, there is a dive center;5
We travelled as a group of 8 and stayed at Los Corales on the last week of January. We had been to the Bucanero three years previous, and can easily say that Los Corales was a much better stay. The chamber maids are friendly, as well as the wait staff in the buffet dining area.  We booked a la cart three times (twice for seafood). The extra $25 for lobster is well worth it.  We could barely eat it all, it was so huge. The beach isn't that great, due to the recent hurricanes, but not all that bad, and the snorkeling is fantastic.  Water shoes are a must. The food at the buffet (you can go to either Los Corales or Carasol) was quite good.  It's repetitious, but there's plenty of choice.  The fresh pizza and pasta are terrific, but expect to wait in line (30 minutes or it's free ..;4
Los Corales was a great place to go for a family of 31 (ages 3 to 80) to celebrate an 80th birthday party. Terrible commotion at the airport due to a SunWing screwup (we had booked into Bucanero, and they wanted to spilt us up), but from what we heard from people who had visited both we were lucky - a real beach and lots of shade. No kudos to Sunwing - I would have real reservations using them again. The hotel rooms were pleasant - the power did go out from time to time, but our room had a backup light source, and you are in one of the poorest countries in the Carribean. Food was OK generally, but outstanding on New Years Eve. Pool was great, and the beach was wonderful. Snorkellling not fantastic. Did two of the day trips - Santiago by boat, and the 450 steps one. Both well;3
people, DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL WE paid 788$ for 1 week and this is what we got: cold food no electricity from time to time cold water in the shower or no water in the shower at all bad smelling sheets & pillows a doctor the is really a pervert a beach with piles of rocks and sticks  this is a 2 in 1 hotel meaning that there are 2 hotels: the corales and the carisol. We were in the corales hotel, which ment that we had to walk for 10 minutes on a little path walk surrounded by fields to the corales hotel everytime we wanted to eat or drink!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i dont think it is safe at all at night for women to walk in the fields alone, with electricity going off a on regular basis  the food was always THE same white rice and red rice green salad, cucumbers, tomatoes WITH NO DRESSING;2
Hey there.  Stayed at Los Corales from May 1st to May 8th.  Here's a detailed review of my experience. Booked the trip with Hola Sun. Flew in with some Cuban Airline.  No problems during the flight, whatsoever.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they charged $1 for non-alcoholic beverages on the plane.  Water, however was free.   The plane was punctual to the minute both ways.  Gorgeous view while landing in Cuba.  The sea coast is less than 30 metres away from the landing strip, and you watch the waves bask the shore as you're landing. After the landing, no problem with the customs officers, whatsoever, however, it took us 2 hours to get our luggage, as the luggage conveyor kept having mechanical malfunctions.  So even though the review says that the hotel is 60;2
"This was my first trip to Santiago (after previous 3 stays at Varadero). After trying hotels with 3, 3.5 and 4 stars I can say that this 3 star hotel was very solid, with enough to offer.  Hotel was clean, stuff friendly and organized properly (no perfect but whatever you need, someone will be around to help and accommodate your requests). Food was good, especially domestic pizza, fresh orange juice and eggs with bacon for breakfast. Wine wasn’t my favorite. Red I didn't like, white was cooled and good with fish. Cocktails were good; I switched to ""Pink Frog"" (no alcohol) after few days of rum and salsa.   Beach is lovely, but swimming less that I expected. Snorkeling great and catamaran ride fun-go for it!  Tour operator: Sunwing, excellent. Plain, both way trip, crew lovely.";4
I just got back today and i thought i'd have to write a review for Corales. I read some of the reviews and was afraid that it'd be bad. I guess everyone has their perceptions in things but seems like during my stay, i still loved it. Even everyone else that i've spoken to loved it as well. Its my first time in Cuba but i've also been to the Dominican. Just read on!  I loved it for a 3 star resort:   i'm in my 20's, i love white beaches, and if you expect a beautiful white sandy beach with clear blue water... don't choose this resort.  other than that, i went with 2 other of my gf's, and we had a lot of fun, the first day we got there was at nite!!! which we were quite mad about, but the next day we went straight for tanning by the pool, and one of the reasons why i booked this;4
We had a beautiful time at this resort...loved it and would go again... food was excellent...staff were great...water warm(beach and swimming pool). Flight was great and of course the weather was hot...about 30 degrees C. and sunny all the time.I suppose that there is always something a bit negative to talk about and there was just one thing. Without going into great detail and spending tons of words on this issue: We would NOT advise going into the city of Santiago...VERY,VERY disappointing...we are sad to say that the city is polluted beyond belief from all the cars and buses not having anti-pollution systems....A bit like Mexico city...and we were harassed forever so we stayed only 15 minutes!!! But again the resort is great and we will for sure go again...Norman and Heather;5
we have been to cuba 10 x now and this is the best 3 star we've been to. we love to snorkel and were able to do so right off the beach and across the reef. the food was the best we've had in comparable resorts. we came home well and loved the staff, service etc. the rooms were clean and spacious.carisol was closed because you folks seem enamoured of varadero beaches and 5 star hotels! we've always found the weather on the south coast to be better than average.13 days of sunshine and 85 degree weather with balmy breezes.our response from forums and reviews was a terrific help in what  to expect here. thank you all.;4
I just returned from my third visit to Corales. As always, I had a great time. I love the resort, it's very clean and modern. Lots of hot water in the showers. The grounds are very well kept. The pool is beautiful and very clean.   The people working at the resort are so friendly, Gabriel, Odalis, Suramis, Charlie, Tony, and Frank. I was disappointed that many of my other favorite people were on vacation.    The food is okay. You can always find something good. The pizza and the orange juice are great! Also, the omlettes. The shows at night are very good. I saw some of the dancers practicing in the afternoon and know they put their heart in their work. I especially liked the dinner entertainment. One band imparticular. I bought their cd and have listened to it over and over;4
"Just got back on March 20th. I have been going to Cuba since 1984. Went with 5 children under 12, parents over 65, and the rest 30-40y.o. Thirteen people altogether. Cannot get beer at most bars. They ran out everytime. Nothing else to order because everything would run out, even coke for the kids. No fresh fish like you'd expect from a beach resort; food was really really bad and I KNOW what to expect in Cuba. Pizza and pasta was the only thing and the kids would look forward to it and rush to the buffet only to find out they ran out. You had to go right when they opened or the cheese ran out. The kids were bored. No animation team around that didn't look ""hung over"" from the disco night before. You couldn't even exchange towels daily because the guys were never there. Mother";1
Just returned from an amazing vacation at this resort.  I had read through all of the reviews I could find before we left and was a little disappointed to find out that we would be staying at the Carisol Section of this resort because of the reviews I had read.  But let me tell you, the Carisol was great!  OK, so the food sucked, but who goes to Cuba for the food anyway?(The food at the Los Corales is much better and you can eat there everyday so no biggie.)  The beach was nice, and there were lots of chairs scattered all along the length between the two hotels (Not to mention the two beach bars).  The pools at both hotels are great and both have swim up bars.  This is the perfect resort to visit if you are looking for a nice, quiet, peaceful vacation.  We spent most of our time;4
Our visit was from Mar 1 -8, 2007. This is a girl friends week away. This was our 3rd visit to Los Corales and it won't be the last.  The first 2 times we stayed at Los Corales and this time they put us in Carisol. When I found out we were to stay at Carisol I was really worried but when I saw the grounds and room I was thoroughly pleased. We stayed in room 414 which is on the 2nd floor facing the pool. The room was very clean and there were 3 beds even though we were 2 people. The rooms also have a small fridge. Yes the beds are hard but I asked for another pillow and that seemed to help.   If you are looking for 5star food you will not find it here. You definitely do not go here because of the food. We brought some of our own food - salsa and nachos, peanut butter, M&M's (my;4
"We didn't actually book Club Amigo, we booked Club Bucanero and they ""overbooked"" so we got shipped off to club Amigo.  It was a blessing!  The place was so empty, the twin resort Club Carisol was busier and you can go to either hotel for meals and entertainment which was nice. The beach was not the greatest, too much rock and coral.  You need water shoes.  Rooms were clean and some of the staff were nice.  I've stayed at other hotels where staff are kept pretty seperate, not the case here...the staff are the majority of the population at the hotel. Most staff played harder than they worked.  They ran out of beer everyday but there was plenty of rum punch.  There was also a wide selection of farm animals, cats and dogs.  I unfortunately have a soft spot for animals and found it";3
Just got back from Club Amigo and had a blast.    But here are the facts...  1)  Stay on the top floor!  The staff stay in the bottom rooms when they need a place to stay, so you do the math. 2)  Food was typical 3) Fresh Pizza at lunch was great, breakfast not sooooo much 4) staff was friendly 5) not very busy.. good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. 6) Beach was about a 3/5.  7) Relatively clean.....3.5/5 8) Play volleyball at the beach with  the Oscar and his crew! 5/5 9) Fun entertainment night life 4/5  And when you go to Santiago if you like the feeling of everyone asking you for change.....your golden!  be careful......  I'd go again if the price was right!;3
I've been to Cuba several times and I liked this hotel. I thought the food was good. I could always find something decent to eat though the lines were sometimes long at the breakfast grill or the pasta station. I was there for 2 weeks in early Feb. At that time, the hotel did not rent scooters or have bicycles. If you are interested in a scooter, contact Delvis at the hotel Santiago. She might be able to make arrangements to bring it out to you. Katia, the rep from the Bucanero rarely returned calls and did not show up when promised.   The weather was great and I will most likely return to this hotel. There often seem to be great deals here, and I think you can't go wrong as long as your expectations aren't unrealistic. It is a 3* hotel, and it is Cuba.  I posted pictures;4
I've been to Cuba 9 times and I would have to say this is the worst one. The grounds were poorly kept, poor choice of food and the staff weren't all that friendly. The rooms were like any other room, and the beach was only okay too. I've stayed at better resorts and I wouldn't recommend this resort.;2
If your looking to get away from civilization this is the place! No where near any major towns. Beautiful resort. Clean and comfortable rooms. Bring your pillow! Lots of resh fruit!;4
We stayed here for 3 days in Jan. 2007 and had a blast!  The property is absolutely beautiful with lots of gardens and a very large pool with kids' wading area and swim-up bar.  The rooms are large, spacious and very clean with large bathrooms, ample closet space and a free safe which you should definitely use.  You should bring washcloths and hand towels with you because you probably won't get any, but the bath towels are huge and luxurious.   The entire property is very clean and the food here is some of the tastiest I have ever had anywhere in Cuba!  Lots of local dishes accompanied by more standard fare.  The beach is large and clean, lots of shady spots for me and sun for my partner,  I loved lying in a hammock under a tree and reading on the beach.  The entertainment team;5
Good choice, better place to stay, if you want to get to Santiago de Cuba and relaxe on a nice sandy beach.........  This accomodation has 2 different hotels on the same property.  Be assured to choose the Los Corales hotel which is a lot better, newer and renovated.  The food is better than the Carisol and the gardens around the property are luxurious.  I had a very relaxing week and plenty of time to enjoy the tranquility of the resort.  Quiet place.  Dont go there if you want to party all night........nothing to do after 11h00pm.  Distance to Santiago: approx. 45 min.;3
My husband and I went down with my friend and her parents for some R & R.    Our travel agent did not know anyone who had gone there so we took our chances and really lucked out.  First of all, I have been to Varadero four times now and down in Santiago it is quite a bit warmer and the views are incredible with the mountains and lush greenery.  Los Corales is beautiful and the rooms were fine.  There was an Italien manager when we went and the food was to die for!!!  We all gained weight because there was alot of Italien food and it was wonderful.  There was entertainment every night and one night they had it on the beach which was great.  The beach bar is actually ON the beach which is nice.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We walked over to the other resort which was the;5
It was great, great food, no problemon the beach because of guards, free safe, beach towels, domestic and international drinks, etc etc etc..;5
I just returned two days ago from one of the best vacations I have ever went on. I absolutely love Los Corales and all of the staff at this resort.  If you are looking for 5 star accomodations and fine cuisine, this may not be the place for you...  BUT...if you are looking for an awesome pool, bars, nightly shows, amazing staff, great pizza and pasta bar, this is the place for you.  My friends and I (ages 27-29) went down on Boxing Day this year for a vacation.  The plane ride was a nice surprise as Cubana Air has lots of leg room and free drinks on the way down. Plus - they give you a meal!  The ride from the airport was about an hour....It is beautiful during daylight (which we saw on our return to the airport).  We had booked a triple and arrived to find three beds, just as;4
"We spent a week at the Los Corales, the worst experience we ever had; the food was horrible (no variety and cold), tables were dirty and bugs were all over the place(some  food trays had a lot of bugs on them). The room had no privacy (you can hear every single sound people in the other rooms make, even when they are using their washrooms). Under Canadian and US health regulations this place would be shut down.  We paid for a scuba diving option with the hotel and we were promised clear waters and a lot of fish; well I saw more fish at the beach than I did through the excursion (I personally think it was a rip off).  The city of Santiago de Cuba does not have much to offer so if you can avoid it try to (otherwise you will waste your money as the guides are unqualified and there";1
We first stayed at Los Corales in 2003, and found it be everything we had hoped for. Having stayed in Playa Del Este near Havana one year and Varadero the following year, we were pleased overall with the quality of the room, the food, and the beach. Although the beach was not as nice as Varadero, the water was clean, plenty of shade on the beach, and there is a little reef off the beach for some (unadventurous) snorkeling.   The pool is very pretty and there is a sunken bar there staffed by Francisco, the man who I truly think IS the best bartender in Cuba. We are also well acquainted with Charles (Carlos - AKA Charlie) in the lobby bar whom someone mentions above and I would have to say he is the second best. Francisco has greeted us by name,  with unfailing warmth, on every;4
I went to Los Corales in April of 2006. I had not been away for many years and was extremely exited to go on vacation with my family. I was quickly disapointed by almost every aspect of the resort. Like I said it was April and so maybe as others have commented it would be much better in high season but it really was not good at the end of the season.   The food was horrible. The very first night I saw bugs crawling through one of the pasta dishes at the buffet. The food was cold and extremely bland. Extremely greasy. There were birds flying around and flys were every where.  Not to mention the stray cats and dogs that also joined you while you were dining. We ended up eating a la carte for the remainder of the trip which meant pizza every night for dinner and spaghetti for;1
We stayed at Los Corales (April ’06) for 2 wks. and have this to share with you:   * The Resort features nicely landscaped garden paths, mature palm trees, and cactus surrounded by large tracts of grassland used for grazing by goats, sheep, horses, cattle and even piglets – one couldn’t ask for a more picturesque pastoral setting! Situated among the beautiful UNESCO-declared Bacanao Park on the south coast, it lies on the Caribbean Sea where the Sierra Maestra mountains can be seen in the distance. For anyone looking to relax in a tranquil, isolated setting, this is a place for you.    * ACCOMODATIONS are well kept, clean, although some rooms are better than others and the necessity for minor repairs isn’t uncommon (e.g. running toilets, burnt out light bulbs). Staff are pleased;4
"After reading all of the reviews prior to our trip (Apr. 23 to Apr. 30 ) my wife and I had a good understanding of what to expect before we arrived.  The friendly staff , warm but not hot meals, beach shoes , tipping etc. Also there is a good selection of pictures here except for the famous honeymoon couple that went out of their way to portray a ""different"" Los Corales. For a 3 star resort we thought we got our money's worth and more. Knowing what to expect we had few surprises which helped to look at all the negatives in a better light.  I found the food to be good.  I wasn't expecting 5 star meals. Bringing gifts was definately a bonus for us and the staff .  One highlight was a bike tour we took with Frank the entertainer for over an hour and a half. It was informative and";4
My wife and I like to thank all the staffmembers of los Corales for a beautifull and relaxing holiday.They did everything to please you and for us everything was excelent.I am a small business man for almost 35 years we traveled a lot,and let me tell you,we got value for our money and much more than that.There was excelent snorkeling right in front of the beach.exelent swimming on the beach or in the pool.We always went swimming at high tide.(or snorkeling)Alittle further down the beach,on the rocks,I did some exelent fishing.And when we wanted to cool off we went under the trees in a beachchair or in a hammock,enjoying the breezes of the carrebian wind with a refreshing drink of the beachbar.The rooms were spotless(all of thehotel)The food was excelent(hey you are in Cuba and;5
I went to Hotel Amigo Los Corales with my 2 children for a week April 23–30.  Perhaps it’s into the low season, the Carisol section was closed down, so less the facility that the other reviewers were raving about. I have been to Cayo Coco, Punta Cana and Panama City and I feel this is definitely a 3-star resort.  I paid $750 (from Toronto) per person, including tax through Nolitours via Exitnow.ca, booked 14 days prior to departure.  Flights and Customs: Flights were smooth, the in-flight meals were okay and there were no checking or questioning at the custom. The guide tried her best to make the 1-hour bus ride not boring.  Accommodation: We stayed in the 400 block, upper floor, facing the pool and backing to the mountains. The room is spacious and the washroom is clean.  There;3
Accomodations very well taken care of. Rooms are great for the price. Staff is great. Beach is mediocre. Unfortunately I would take a beach tent in exchange for good food. I love my food and variety and this place DID NOT provide it. Everything was okay but that. It is the only thing stopping me from ever returning.  Was hungering for home desperately after two weeks. This is also not a location for looking for excitement and fun. It is pretty laid back and meant for peace and relaxation I think.;3
My mum and I stayed at Los Corales from March 9th to 16th this year for one week. We had absolutely perfect weather, and a beyond fabulous time. Our flight was pleasant with Sun Wing – we even got complimentary champagne on the way there.   FOOD: The buffet restaurant was average. I personally disliked the breakfast. The fresh orange juice was lovely, and is squeezed all morning long. The lunch at the sister resort was usually better – they have burgers and great potato fries! The lunch buffet at our hotel was very bland and boring unless a pasta dish was on the menu. We ate a lot of cucumbers and raw cabbage – which was okay for a week, but I was happy to get back to real salad dressing and other veggies. Dinners were usually okay, although again, not much flavor. Had dinner at;4
I stayed at the Los Corales last week...April 6 - 13th.  The trip was with Hola Sun, which was ok, but didn't make too much of an appearance in the hotel.  Sunwing was great.  The airline served pretty good meals and they were always available at the hotel if you needed anything.  I believe the guy's name was Gabriel and his English was perfect.    I guess our biggest disappointment was that since this is the end of the tourist season, staff and services were greatly reduced.  We had several people tell us that, who had been during the winter months.  The beach was interesting for finding shells and sea life like crabs, but certainly isn't like the typical Caribbean beach of white powdery sand.  Water shoes really are a must.  The water was incredibly warm!  The pool at the;3
My wife and myself stayed at the Hotel Los Corales for a two week period starting the last week of March. We have travelled for the past 9 years all over Cuba so we are very open minded about the resorts we visit for the first time. We decided to come to this area based on reviews from this site and because friend's had visited in the past and enjoyed it. This review will try to summarize the positives and the negative's in order.  The flight down was with Sunwing Airlines and I am confused why people have been complaining about this airline. The flights were on time with excellent service and had many extra's (hot meal,free earphones,good movies,drinks) that you do not see on other charters. Based on this experience we would fly with them again in a heartbeat.  We were met at;2
I went to Club Amigo Carisol on the 23rd Feb, 2006. It was not a destination that I had researched, but it was the only place I could get to with the one days notice I had given my travel agent.  So on her recommendation I booked it.  I was a little apprehensive as I was travelling by myself, and had no idea what the resort would be like, I had gone to Cayo Largo before and did not have a great experience in that part of Cuba, as a matter of fact I said after that trip it would be highly unlikely that I would return to Cuba at all. So I arrived and I can tell you that I was more than pleased. The Low Down: Check in and Check out- arrived pretty late at night, and was greeted by a very pleasant man our Hola Sun Rep Elbert, who helped get us all on board and off to the resort, I;5
"We got a great last minute deal on this trip so we weren't expecting the best...what a bonus we got!!  The hotel is very nice, clean and always someone around to help in any way they can.  The shows were great each night and the food was good as well.  I had read reviews of Cuban food not being all that great so I wasn't expecting to gain weight on our vacation.  As in another review that I read...the only thing that made me crazy was the other people that got a great deal as we did and did nothing but complain about it not being up to ""standard"".  If you want a 4 or 5 star hotel, pay the money and go there, otherwise be quiet and don't make the rest of us listen to your whining.  I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.  The staff is amazing and can't wait to see them again";5
I feel it is important to comment on the honeymooners review of this resort.  Our party consisted of 4 adults and we had a great time.  From doing homework and reading reviews that other travellers had posted, we got exactly what we wanted.  The beach was great, however, if you are looking for perfectly white sandy beach, you are not going to get it here.  Watersocks are a must if you want to go snorkeling.  I did not snorkle but the other 3 members of our group did and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are two resorts and you have a choice of eating at either one.  We did not eat at Carisol but the food at Los Corales was fine.  You are not going to go hungry and if you wanted hot food it was available at the pasta bar, ie fish, pork, chicken and pasta on a daily basis.  There was;4
I am a single mother and brought my fourteen year old daughter. It was perfectly adequate and if there were shortfalls it wasn't because they weren't trying. First advice bring whatever personal supplies you need it is hard to get toiletries and medicine (suggest sunbock, pepto bismol, antihistamine, cortate cream-sun rash, and tylenol). Food was very healthy, lots of fresh vegetables and fruit. Their cookes were the best. Cake was delicious when available. They are not cheap with their drinks. Mohitos with mint delicious. Bring your oversize mug and a water bottle, so you can get larger drinks and have your water nearby. Make sure you have your change for the day so you can tip when you feel like it. Good security all the time. Disco at night at 11 pm is fun to go watch the;3
I would first like to start off by saying that Los Corales and Carisol are one resort and you can take advantage of facilities at both. I was a little leery about booking this resort, due to reviews I had read, but I am very happy that we went ahead, as we had a wonderful vacation.   Rooms: Our room was in the Los Corales section and we were happy to be on this side. I have no idea what the rooms are like on the Carisol side. Our room was in the last section just before the tennis courts and could not have asked for a better location. Our front door was steps to the pool and swim up bar and our patio had a view of the ocean (although not real close). Our room was not huge, and the beds were only about a foot apart, but we did not spend much time there. The bathroom had a walk in;4
First of,I am Armita Iravani giving my opinion on a trip I just had almost two weeks ago at Cuba. When I arrived in Santiago de Cuba, I thought to myself that it would be an average trip.Guess I was wrong because I felt like a queen day one till day seven. I had a trip at the resort Club Amigo, Los Corales which is a three star hotel that feels like a five star.Why, it's clean environment to begin with, very nice people which make you feel warm and good. The food was exquisite and healthy. Foul of vitamines,iron,protein,fiber and passion because that was the chefs secret ingredient to their successful cuban dishes. The pool was fantastic and the disco club was smashing. I couldn't stop dancing and even came up with a few dance moves that I never thought I would come up with.;5
This was suppose to be our unforgettable honeymoon and it sure was – however terrifying and regretful. We wouldn’t want anyone else to have to go through this experience ever.  We were there for two weeks (Feb25-March10) and believe me when we say this, after the second day we wished we were back home in Canada.  Here are some terrifying aspects of the trip: •The food selection and hygiene was terrible – birds were flying over the food and eating it straight from the food platters or even your places.  Table cloths were covered in bird droppings and previous sittings. •The food was served barley warm.  •Fruit selection was minimal (unripe pineapple, papaya, grapefruit, oranges and watermelon sliced thinner then paper) There would be two platters of fruits and it they were gone;1
This was the first time we visited a country somewhere in the Carabbiean and it was spectacular! My mom, dad and I went there together and pain a very small price.  Food: THe food was good, alot of variety. THere is breakfast where you can get omlettes, veggies, cheeses, sausages, fresh squuezed juice etc. FOr lunch there was ALOT of variety, my favorite meal there. THey had the normal buffet open, plus the A La Carte buffet which served pastas with whatever you wanted on them. ALso there was a burger/french fry place open on the beach, it was very nice to eat right by the ocean. The food was free, and you could eat as much as you wanted. FOr dinner it was very plesant because they had a salsa band performing every night and they had good meats available too, there was a Grill;5
This place is just amazing i'm so satisfied with the service and the staff is so friendly they make you just wanna come again or even better never leave..thats why i'm going bacc this yr probably in december :);5
March 2nd 2006 just returned from Los Corales. Arrived at the resort and was booked into Bungalow E1 it is rustic but we loved it as it was away from the main area also close to the beach. Beach is golden sand with some shell/stoney parts so water shoes recommended, lots of loungers and shade trees also hammocks hanging in the trees were wonderful. Snorkeling is great just off the beach and I recommend the snorkel trip. The coral reef that runs the lenght of the shore provides a break wall so that the waters are calm on the beach side however the ocean side of that reef has strong under currents at times so ask at the snorkel hut for tidal info if you intend swimming/snorkeling on that side. I don't dive but saw lots of trips going out to dive sites.  Note, there were no small;4
We have just returned back from our trip to Los Corales. Let me tell you I have been to alot of places and nothing beats this resort.  The staff is excellent the disco rocks!!!!!! and the resort is just so relaxing.  Our Sung Wing rep Gabrielle was excellent he helped us from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  I will surely miss him.  The kitchen staff was also very friendly, Rayzeer was number 1.  The food well not bad at all since I am a vegetarian, there is lots to choose from, well breakfast all three of us always missed it but the cappicinoes at the bar were spectacular. We did the excursion swim with the dolphines that was worth it but not the remaing of the excursion, the excursion in which you must do is the trip to Santiago, I would never give this up, it is;5
"My husband, our daughter and I were at Corales from Jan.1/06 to Jan.15/06. We are both in our 20s and our daughter is 4. We have enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel has beautiful landscaping, and the mountains in the background just adds to the scenary. The Hotel in itself is very well planed out everything is close and is easy to access. We had a room in the triple section ( meaning with three twin size beds)with the view of the pool and the stage. The room was nice and clean, air conditioner worked very well and we always had hot water. The safe was very useful and we did not have to carry the key around, we just entered our own password (safe was 2 Convertable Pesos a day)Caution: Always ask for corner room because the rest of the rooms have very ""thin"" door in between the";4
i had just came back from a trip with my mother! we had the best time ever. this was her second time to the resort and my first! i had such a good time. the food was good, so i dont see why everyone complained about how much they did not like it. i loved it! the staff was so friendly! i got along really well with the entertainment staff. Geroge looks really good dressed up like a female! anyways the disco at night was really good they played lots of interesting cuban music. we went into town with some friends and had a blast! i am going back in April and i cant wait! miss you guys! see you soon! the beach was nice and they had many interesting things to do, such as snokling, paddle boating and they played music too. they always had music playing both at the beach and the pool.;5
"This property consists out of 2 seperate resorts that have recently been taken over by the Cubans(Amigo Hotels) We found the staff average, food below average,line ups for ""special foods like pasta etc.  Beach (as well as the rest of the property) heavely damaged by the huricanes; tennis courts destroyed.

"Three women from our family (myself, my mother and my youngest daughter) have just returned from a week long vacation at Los Corales. We arrived at our hotel late in the evening and found that we were one of two families not on the hotel's list of guests. The hotel was apparently full so they offered us one of the units in a bungalow they keep unreserved. The problem was that the unit was beside a parking lot, with two narrow beds (not three as I reserved with my travel agent)and a flooded bathroom to top it off. I went back and complained and we were send ""next door"" to hotel Carisol. With no transportation available, the 15 min. walk at midnight (there is a large strip of empty land between the two hotels)was no fun for any of us, especially my elderly mother. PLEASE NOTE: If";4
My husband and I, with 3 girls, just spent 2 weeks over Christmas at the Los Corales. The bus ride to the hotel from the airport was long, about an hour. At this moment, Carisol and Los Corles are two separate hotels and do not have exchange priviliges. Merger talks are underway and a deal may be close in the near future. The Sunwing rep, Gabriel was excellent and helpful at all times.  The hotel grounds was very nice. The whole place was very clean. The rooms were renovated and the cleanest in the 4 Cuban hotels that we have stayed. Rooms are of average size and adequately furnished, although no remote for the TV. Sunwing provides free safe and fridge in every room.The caulking on the shower door was not done properly, so our bathroom floor was wet all the time. Our chambermaid;4
My Wife and I just returned from Los Corales.  This was by far our best vacation together as a couple.  We are in our early 30's and found the resort and people grew on us to the point that we were almost crying when we left for our plane.  It was VERY hard to say good-bye to the staff when we left.   YOU MUST HAVE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS when going to the Los Corales.  It is not glamourous as other resorts in Mexico and elsewhere that enjoy large US investments.  It is charming, clean, fun but not overly loud, and the pool was huge and refreshing (not too much chlorine).  Raul gave us salsa lessons and danced with us on the beach in the evenings.  He is the nicest guy on the planet and was sure to help us find our way around. Leo took us on an incredible 2 hour bike ride down;5
The Two Hotels The Club Amigo Carisol Los Corales that you see advertised by travel agents actually consists of two hotels – The Club Amigo Carisol and the Hotel Los Corales. The Carisol caters mainly to French-speaking Canadians whereas the Los Corales mainly to English-speaking Canadians with a sprinkling of Italians and Cubans. When you make your bookings, if, like us, you do not specify a hotel, your travel agent will make the choice for you. If you book from French-speaking Canada, you are usually allocated to the Carisol, and the rest to the Corales.  These two hotels are a few minutes apart and guests of both hotels wonder in and out of them at will. Having been to both, I highly recommend that Corales because both the facilities and the food are better and the staff are;4
I was in Cuba from March 27 till April 3 and had the time of my life... this was my first visit ever to Cuba.. the hotel was immaculate.. the staff were inviting and friendly and ready to assist at any given time..  we were greeted with a smile no matter what part of the hotel we were in.  At no time during our stay did we ever feel unsafe or disrespected... we were three Indian women, two sisters and a cousin, travelling together.. we brought with us a part of our culture to the hotel which fascinated the staff and other tourists.. i have recommended this hotel to all my friends here in canada... we actually bonded with some staff members at the hotel.. and they became like our extended family.. we exchanged addresses and hope to keep in contact through email or regular mail..;5
My sister, another friend and I went to Santiago Du Cuba last month. My sister and I have been to other places in Cuba previously like Veradero, Houlgin, San Fiegos. While we enjoyed most places, we found Veradero to be very commercialized and crowded. We especially liked the natural beauty of where the Hotel is situated, surrounded by mountains on the three sides. The beach is beautiful with white sand and warm shallow water. This area seems to be greener than some other areas we have visited before.   We were a little concerned after seeing the reviews that only the French people were visiting this place and that this hotel was rated only 2 1/2 stars. But the French people were friendly enough. And the hotel was very well kept. The swimming pool was nice with the swim to the;4
We spent this past March Break at the Carisol. We loved the tranquil atmosphere, clean beaches and the very friendly hotel staff. While the resort catered to Francophones, we went just to unwind and didn't feel the need for western-style entertainment. It was a great place to take the family. It caters to tourists who want to experience another culture, it's not for those who want to take a piece of home wherever they go. While it helps to speak Spanish, the staff were very accomodating. The food was varied, some days more appetizing than others, but always lots of fresh choices. We felt completely safe on the beautiful grounds of the hotel. We highly recommend it for those who want to get to know the real Cuba.;4
My wife and two kids (under age of 7) went to Los Corales in Santaigo de Cuba for a week in early April 2005.  We have been to two different areas of Cuba and this area is unique in that you have nice beach ( with coral for snorkelling) but also mountains in the background.  Also, this was our first time on the Caribbean, and the water was so warm.  Resort was not a 5 star but I didn't expect or pay for a 5 star.  We were concerned being a 3 star in Cuba but were quite happy with facilities and ESPECIALLY THE STAFF !!  Food was average but we all managed to eat well.  Kids especially liked the pasta bar and beach hotdogs.  Coffee is from a machine that dispenses one at a time but we both enjoyed it.  Great thing about the bars was the lack of waits like I have had at other;4
I went to Los Corales in Santiago de Cuba for 1 week (March 29-April4/05) with my mother and sister for a wonderful trip. The resort was very clean and the staff very friendly. Rooms were clean and air conditioned. TVs were in the rooms with a couple of english channels if you were missing home! There is also a good internet service - 1 hr for 6 pesos but it is realtively fast internet and nice to touch base with those at home!  FOOD  The food was average on the buffet. Lots of rice and veggies. It was best to get there within an hour of start time for it to be the hottest and freshest. They also had an a la carte area for pasta and grilled meats - Excellent!! There were also burgers and occaisonally french fries on the beach. They had fresh bread every day - this was my;4
"We just got back from Los Corales 5 days ago. It was a fine resort. Clean. The hotel was nice (block#100 is very average, Block #200 & #300 have a view of the garden and some ocean. Block #400 & #500 have a view of the pool) The food was average. The buffet was open from 7-10 am, 12-2pm for luch and 7-9pm for dinner. At 4pm there was some small snack too. Bars are open all day at different locations so you can get drinks all the time. At 12- 2pm luch was also available at the beach. A cook prepared a barbeque hamburger and really really good fries. This was a great change from the buffet since the food there was very repetative. You could also make reservations for dinner at ""the grill"" It was also a barbeque kind of meal. For extra $ you could purchase lobsters and shrimps. I";3
I have to start by saying that these two Resorts, Club Amigo and Los Corales, are different resorts. Cluba Amigo is 5 minutes down the beach. We did share the same beach but they had their own facilities as did we. I can't say anything bad about Club Amigo, I did visit the disco one night and there was about 10 people in the whole place. Most nights, guests from Club Amigo would visit the Los Corales disco on the beach. With that said, here's my review.  My friends and I visited Los Corales during the week of March 12th - 19th. The place was amazing. You could almost eat off the floors there, it was so clean. I don't remember once not seeing someone sweeping the pathways. Our room was immaculate.   The staff were extremely friendly and would help you out in any way they could.;5
The terrain is arid, wild and mountainous, removed from most major attractions - this matters little when you have a mere week to tan, relax, snorkel, swim, kayak in the Caribbean and lounge about the pool bar.  These were our goals so we didn't care about the terrible shows (despite the very hard working staff), or the weak cocktails (drink more), or the broken beach chairs (be creative with extra parts).   We found we could be in company with others, or have lots of solitude simply by choice of beach area.  The staff are great, but do exchange lots of small convertible $$ (at airport but the hotel will also exchange), and do tip as you go - you'll find it improves your service.  Lovely landscaping, low rise and spread out buildings makes it feel like a small resort.;4
We stay at Los Corales in April definitelly we will back again,everything is  fine with this hotel, there are always people who complain for everything, you can't pleased them, the problem is they want to pay a little and they expect 5star for return, hey body then you go to States and you can complain. Ok. Place is clean, you have food( who needs a 100 variety of selection), staff is friendly, there is always sun.For average people who is going for vacation to relax is Ok.;4
We recently reurned from Los Corales after spending two weeks there during the march break. This hotel is a good value and  would be a reccommeded trip for most people. We have been to Cuba 7 times in the last 10 years. we were not expecting much but we were pleased with the resort as a whole. I can address  a few of the things vacationers would be concerned about.  The beach was very nice and long enough for pleasant walk. There is sea grass , not sea weed as the water is shallow to the reef about 1/3 of a mile off shore. Watershoes are reccommended.The good thing is you can snorkel right there and see lots of different fish. We enjoyed this as did our teenage children. There is a tour for $25 that I would advise as we found it a good value. You are taken by  boat (outboard;3
"We recently returned(April /05) from a first ever trip to Los Corales and Cuba.  Our biggest problems were ""prior expectations"". Our last two trips south were both on 4-5 star venues so we had kind of set ourselves up. It took us a couple of days but once we acclimatized it was fine and with the exception of the food it got better every day.  The weather was awesome, high 20's to low 30's everyday. You could be in the ocean or pool at 7:00 in the am and not be uncomfortable. The locals were helpful and friendly and we met lots of great people there.  Live stage shows every night with a variety of entertainment. The best thing we could say about the food was that it was cooked and no doubt nutritious. Flavour and taste were another matter. And while you generally don't go on a";2
We stayed at Los Corales March 14 to 21.  It was an awesome holiday.  We were there with our children 10 and 14.  There were plenty of kids there (March break in Ontario) and activities to keep them busy all day long.  They did not once complain about being borred.  After reading some of the reviews, it makes me shuckle to read some of the complaints people have.  When we go on holidays, especially to a 2nd or 3rd world country, we don't expect things to be like at home.  You have to be open minded and go along with their culture, whether it be with food, service, accommodations, facilities, etc.   If you don't want a culture difference then I suggest you travel within north america.  Los Corales was an extremely clean and safe resort.  Our children could roam the resort and;4

Club Amigo Carisol-Corales is horrible. Unless you are french speaking, spanish speaking, or even italian speaking. dont bother even booking at this hotel. Heres the break down. Im going to make this very brief indicating the good and bad in categories.   People traveling: 4 Rooms: 2 rooms with 2 queens  The good: Beds kept.  washroom cleaned daily. the disco at the surrounding resort played great music. it was on a deck close to the sea. and the drinks tasted a lot better at this place. This disco wasnt the best, but it was a lot better than the disco on our resort.

There was only a couple of people in there 20's at the resort.  The resort is open from November until April.  It closes for the summer months.

Don't get Club Amigo Carisol and Los Corales (caters to Italian patrons) confused as they are not the same club and one cannot use both facilities as stated by your Tour Operator (World of Vacations) Also the 2 Al la Carte meals you are promised are not included or recognized by the hotel.

We stayed at Los Corales Feb 14 to Feb 21 , tour operator Hola Sun.  It was a great week. Our party consisted of 2 families, with kids 15, 16 and 17.

There were a few college students,  a few young families  with babies, quite a few middle age couples and a large portion were retired people of European decent from either Toronto , Montreal or Europe, quite a few italians. Some of these oldsters could use some tuning in about butting in line and complaining in general!We met some nice French Canadian people from Quebec. The resort is very clean with decent rooms, always hot water. Maid service was excellent. Generally the service was friendly but not necessarily quick. Food was OK but not a great;4
Visited Los Corales in January 2005 as a 'last minute' vacation.  Totally all and more than we expected! It is a hotel with alot of warmth, down to earth and relaxing atmosphere.  Welcoming committee and band were awesome - everyone made us feel right at home!  Staff were excellent - always smiling and eager to please!  Rooms were very, very clean and roomy and comfortable...never went without hot water or air conditioning! Food was fabulous - tons of selection and very, very tasty!  The entertainment staff were phenomenal......Miquel, Raul, Jorge, and Leo!!! Great bunch of guys!  The shows at night were really, really entertaining and finishing the night at the beach 'disco bar' was awesome!  The band that played during dinner was SUPER as well. There was a mixture of ages -;4
had an awesome time . Animation team was excellant . they kept everyone involved in games , dancing, etc. Rooms were very clean. Beds were made up with new designs everyday during our stay.Hot water everyday,no problem what so ever.Shows were better then I,ve seen at 4 and 5 star resorts. This resort is rated a 3 to 3.5 star.Very cheap resort. Well worth the money. Not as many choices of food ,but who needs 50 choices each seating. Would go back in a minute.Could go back 3 times for same money as a 5 star.;4
1.	The reception guy said there was no password for WiFi, but the GUEST network for which there was no password did not work, and the MANAGER network that worked required a password that I had to call and get. 2.	There was no place to eat a traditional breakfast. Even the Valentine Café was not open in the morning every day. 3.	The thermostat in the room could not be set to a level to produce heat. It was blowing out cold air when it was already cold outside. I called for assistance and was told the engineer would come to my room to fix it. After an hour of waiting, when the engineer did not show up, I called again, and was told the engineer was not coming to my room but was fixing it centrally. 4.	There were tiny black insects all over the bathroom sink. The more I killed, the;1
What a huge disappointment of a hotel most four points are a lot nicer this needs some serious upgrades! Lightbulb out in room and housekeeping just rings and rings also dirty vent in the bathroom-to name a few! Would not stay here again!  Only perk is it close to LAX!;1
Discard any notion of checking in even a little early.   Sea of humanity crowd the lobby from morning until 2pm when rooms are released.  Your status in this situation means nothing and don't expect any details or empathy from the front desk.    Seems one would capitalise of this situation by having the restaurant/bar open, but it is not until the evening.  Scan and go shop, while interesting, has zero healthy options.   Light sleeper?  Get ready for the loudest closing hotel doors on the west coast.....;3
Great customer service, horrible pricing for what you get. No fridge, No microwave, Tv doesn't change channels so you can watch a streaming service…on top of the crazy pricing, hotel guest have to pay an extra 42$ a day for parking….;3
Okay for an airport hotel. Room was clean, but not great as far as an American hotel... The layout of the floors and towers was super confusing, the shower had a strange controller and leaked a ton of water onto the floor, tiny bathroom (door hitting the toilet small) super loud old AC unit.;3
Must be ⭐️instead of ⭐️⭐️⭐️  Check in Experience:   Ok   Room condition:  Very poor , all furniture and door entrance damaged . Toilet need to be completed closed at the time of flushing because water splashes up . Paid $ 204 dollars and the room view is horrible  Cleanness:  Ok;2
Once we got to the parking the guy there was supper rude, when getting to the room I felt uncomfortable because there is a big window next to the door and I don’t consider it something safe the room was small but ok for the price once getting to the bathroom the door knob was nasty and dirty there was finger prints on the wall and black dots in the wall the shower was also dirty when showering we realized there was no shampoo or body wash, wile brushing my teeth I felt a water drop fall on my head coming from the roof, to top it all off the was a roach coming from the AC vent over all bad cleaning will never be coming back here;1
For an overnight airport stop this hotel was satisfactory. Our room was large but purely functional - there was nothing attractive about it ….. all rather dull, brown and worn with appalling lighting ……. but you get what you pay for and this wasn’t too pricey. The plumbing was the worst feature, taps very wobbly, uncontrollable faucet, etc. It was surprisingly quiet which was a great benefit, though to be woken in the early hours by an alarm clock set by the previous occupant was pretty annoying!!! (Perhaps that’s something housekeeping could check for?) Arriving too late for dining, the grab’n’go shop seemed like an excellent idea, however it was primarily very unhealthy food! Our room didn’t have a kettle or microwave (maybe some did) so the microwaveable and ‘add hot water’;3
The rooms are very nice. They were clean and smelled good. Great Beds. We got in late. The downstairs bar was relaxing and offered decent food for us to take back to the room. The overall atmosphere at the hotel is vey relaxing. I would have given 5 stars except for the parking situation. You pay good money for a hotel and then are charged 40 plus dollars for parking. Just seemed ridiculous to me. But the rooms are nice;4
Stayed for 2 nights with my family. The hotel just needs to be renovated. The bathroom is tiny and dirty, rooms are small and stuffy. One of the automatic entrance doors wasn’t working. They have a tiny market with overpiced snacks in the lobby. You can find much better hotels near LAX for the price.;2
"Lowest priced hotel near LAX, until you check in and find out parking is $42/day. Why not just market the true price rather than gouge people at the front door?  The lamps in the room reminded me of an overly lit corporate office building. Bed was old, worn and uncomfortable; sheets thin and cheap. Shower—terrible (water was hardly even the definition of warm..)  Definitely will not be staying here again.  I did not ask to speak to a manager. Karen rant over…";1
Here’s what you need to know: It’s basically a dorm room, not a hotel. extremely basic hotel with no frills but also has serious maintenance issues - AC and elevators not working. We stayed here for an overnight stay between and evening flight and an early morning flight from LAX.  On the positive, Check in process and shuttle pickup was smooth enough and there are plenty of outlets for charging all devices in the room. Also, Room gets dark enough at night to sleep lightless.  but then the room is in pretty shabby state (with NO WORKING AC, picture frames cracked and peeling, a bathroom that is scuffed and bruised and hasn’t been updated in decades. Also, there was a tiny spider dangling from the ceiling of the bathroom.  2 of 3 elevators (yes, 67% of elevators in the hotel) are;1
Waited an hour for the shuttle as it passed by twice in a far left lane away from the pick up stop. Called the hotel and the front desk manager said it was probably full and that it is not guaranteed to stop since it’s complimentary, now that’s a first time I heard garbage like this. She transferred me to the transportation supervisor, who said, that’s it’s impossible and that I didn’t wait an hour. He was very rude and unprofessional. The third time this shuttle tried to pass us by a ran at it and literally forced it to pull over, as the driver had no intention of stopping again. It was practically empty inside, so the statement made by the front desk manager was nothing but a lie.;1
the service is lousy they have not trained the workers well because they are aggressive and rude you cannot ask for a favor because Mr. Lorenzo Yesterday he wanted to hit me and threw me out of the hotel that security is going to throw me out Only because I asked him for three keys and when he I said let me see her name she covered it up because she knew she was doing wrong;1
Stayed here prior to a long trip and used their long term parking through an outside vendor.  Great rate and very convenient to get shuttle to and from LAX.  There was an issue when I was leaving and I got charged the 1-day rate as their system did not account for the grace period as I was about 2 hours later than billing period.  Worked with Omar Ordonez, Parking Operations Manager at AAA Parking who quickly was able to solve my problem.  Great service.;5
This hotel is really really bad .   It’s old and run down.  My room was so small and so out dated.   There were hairs on the floor and in the shower too.   The hallways smells old too .   If at all possible do not waste your money here .   The lobby area and bar is nice but I was there for 60 seconds.    I wish I read reviewers before I booked;1
We ended up here with a voucher from United Airlines as several delayed connections meant missing our international flight and having to spend an extra 24 hours in Los Angeles.  We had a choice of 3 hotels and picked Four Points thinking that as part of the Sheraton Group it would be of a good standard. Well it may be part of the Sheraton Group but it's nothing special. In fact compared to the other United hotel options (the 2 Sonesta hotels) we've used the Four Points is a poor choice.  The shuttle from the airport at 10.30pm on a Sunday night was fine, about a 30 minute wait but it arrived. The hotel is only a 5 minute drive from the airport. Check in was smooth but don't expect a smile. As we were due to fly out at 10.30pm the following night we were told late check out;2
I was put in this hotel after a flight was cancelled. It's convenient to the airport with a shuttle. But after checking in, as I dragged my suitcase to my room across the dirty carpets, through dark hallways with chipped paint and dented doors, I knew I was staying at a glorified motel.  The room is old, dated and depressing. Some effort has been made to update some of the fixtures, but all the rooms along the hallway have no outside window, with only one window facing a walkway (and you need to shut the blinds to avoid other guests from easily seeing in you room). I felt like I was in a prison cell.  There is one restaurant which is closed much of the day. I was told it served breakfast lunch and dinner when I checked in, but when I turned up at 1 PM the lady said it was closed;2
Stayed here after my plane was late and I missed my connection to Australia and there was not another until the next evening. There was some wait for the shuttle, 8 saw a lot of other hotel shuttles before I saw this hotels one.   The hotel is very dated and depressing. The location is fine for airport hotel and easy to walk to Denny’s etc. if you have other options I wouldn’t pick this one;2
Was it fine to crash for a couple hours in between flights? Yes. Was it nice? No. Honestly it’s a sad looking hotel that may leave you feeling depressed but the bed was comfy. I’d recommend other hotels near the airport over this. The shuttle was prompt early in the morning to take me to the airport but expect a wait if it is picking you up from the airport in the evening.;2
This hotel is generally outdated and not particularly clean.  The bathroom/shower is particularly bad.  Two unauthorised payments made on my Credit Card and attempts to try and resolve this issue for the month while I was in the US and since i've returned to NZ have NEVER been resolved, despite numerous phone calls and emails by myself to resolve.  No doubt someone will reply saying how disappointed to see this and that they will be in touch.  I was given a case number 382591811 by Marriott Bonvoy on 1 September and never heard from them since.;1
The bathroom in my room did not have a fan or window and the cotton cloth shower curtain did nothing in keeping the bathroom floor dry, upon exiting the shower, I stepped into a puddle.  The bed was poorly made and we had to wait over 20 minutes to place our breakfast order.  $42.00 a day for parking was the straw that broke the camels back!  Don’t stay here.;2
For the most part, I had a wonderful stay here.  The staff is very friendly, helpful, and polite.  The atmosphere and food in the restaurant are great.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  Also, I like the decorations in the lobby.  The front desk staff checked me in quickly and even allowed me to check in early!  The only reason I can't give the hotel five stars is that I waited for the airport shuttle for 25 minutes, and when he finally arrived, he did not even stop to check if any of the ten people standing to wait for the airport shuttles were waiting for his hotel.  He was driving fast when he approached, so I came forward with luggage in both hands.  I couldn't wave my hands and didn't think I needed to anyway, as I thought he would stop. He looked at all of us and I guess;4
"I cant believe how awful my stay was. A lot of things were wrong with my room, but what really ruined my trip was the parking. Why charge 42 dollars a night to park? That just blew my mind. I had to speak to someone about this cause surely I thought it was a mistake but nope, there was nothing they could do and I'm just going to have to get scammed I suppose.   Next, my shower barely could function. There was so much buildup in the shower head and while it ran, half the water would not come out and was functioning like a bath. Also I've noticed the air vents don't look so great.   There isn't even a free breakfast because this hotel is so greedy and the only ""free"" thing I had access to was a grimy old coffee maker that I cleaned myself cause no one else is ever going to. I";1
I came into town for a conference arriving late Wednesday night. The lobby was beautiful and staff was friendly. Although No direction on where to park. Very  unsafe parking lot. I saw a security guard asleep by the elevator. I went through the back door (the only way to reach my room from the parking area) paint chipping in the hallways very dark and smelled of mildew. I was staying alone as a single female and felt very uneasy. Low ceilings dark musty hallways and nothing like the pictures online. I arrive at the top of the elevator and round the corner to find double doors and about 7 steps to reach my room….. I thought I was on level 6? Why do I need to drag my suitcase up 7 stairs alone after I just had knee surgery? What if I was in a wheelchair? I enter my room flustered;1
Cleanliness was only ok with rooms being quite outdated and in need of a revamp. Shuttle service was complimentary and all worked fine with our 04:00 am pick-up to get to LAX.  Not sure if I would recommend it though - there are other more modern options in a similar price range.;3
In LA on a. Hai was trip and looked for a hotel near LAX due to an early morning flight the following day.  I was very surprised to see graffiti in the elevators and trash on the floor on the lobby.  Employees were not friendly bordering on being Rude.  I had to change rooms after checkin due to a broken thermostat    Towels are few and hard. Think sandpaper.   Rooms say “Welcome to 1970”.  Too few outlets, poor lighting  and an extremely small TV compared to todays standards.  They charge $42.00 for parking which seems a little outrageous in relation to the cost of the room.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS !;1
We stayed one night at the hotel before flying out. I do not consider the Four Points a vacation hotel. I think it is an excellent hotel for travelers or, I suppose, for businesspeople. For travelers, it’s perfect! I am a lifetime titanium elite and got upgraded to an excellent Jr. Suite. No problems catching the morning elevator for the easy-to-catch shuttle, which runs every 30 minutes starting at 4 AM. We went diving and brought our equipment, which the shuttle could easily accommodate. The rooms are clean and quiet and have a microwave, fridge, desk, wifi, etc.  The staff helped us with our parking. We used way.com, and the QR code of the app did not function well. The staff said they would validate our parking when we returned. The hotel served its purpose. And the price;5
Upon arrival they will keep 100$ on hold, BUT BE CAREFUL SINCE THEY RETURN LESS MONEY (SCAM)!! I paid through the money on hold the dinner I had the night before, but then they charged me more then the dinner bill, with no reason and no explanation!! Tried to contact them several times, but no answers at all!! Fortunately it wasn't a lot of money…;1
Booked hotel and paid in advance for the convenience to fly out the next morning. Thought I got a good deal but was taken back after I was informed of the parking bill for 1 night.   In hindsight I should have driven the rental car back. Exhausting;3
The pictures posted by the hotel are deceiving. The hotel is a rundown dump. You will be shocked, trust me. Read the other reviews on this site and look at the guests pictures they took. The manager’s at this hotel are belligerent and unprofessional, and you will regret booking this motel unless, of course, you’re used to staying at Motel 6’s and Super 8’s.   Read the other reviews before you book. And if you want a good laugh, read the pre-written canned responses by the hotel to each negative review, it’s hysterical!;1
After trying unsuccessfully to get this info from the hotel I can advise that the shuttle bus from/to the airport is wheelchair friendly with a lift in some of the buses. After collecting bags go to Level 2 (checkin level) and we located the pickup spot between T4 and T5 (due construction at the moment) . Drivers are excellent but hotel manager on duty was less than poor and had no idea where the pickup point was.;4
This hotel is gross, many rooms do not have exterior windows, and my kids (who are not picky about hotels at all) said the hallway reminded them of a horror movie.   The hotel shuttle service was convenient and quick, however, and why I rated it the two.  Unless you’re saving a TON of money on the rate (and I don’t feel like we did), I recommend staying somewhere else’s nearby.;2
The hotel is ugly and not very clean, the rooms are at the limit of decency, is very clear that there is a big lack in maintenance (take a look to the pictures) Prices at the restaurant are crazy compare to the food quality, the restaurant and reception personnel  are not very polite, Not suggested, I would not go back.;1
"Decent enough hotel. I liked that it was close to the airport, could literaly walk there from the SWA terminal and my 7th floor room had a nice view of the airport. Unfortunately, at the end, after checking out, they won't return my $100 security depsoit. Even now, a month later, after many calls to the hotel, corporate customer service, something thbey call the Elite Service Team and many assurances that they'll ""take care of it"", I'm still chasing after it. I'm thinking they're deliberately trying to run out the clock and frustrate me to the point of just saying screw it and letting them keep my money. That's not going to happen. I'm thinking of taking legal action.";1
I am surprised that Marriott has its name associated with this property The air conditioning is horrible, rooms are tired. Even after asking for service the rooms are not made.  It’s worse than a platform at a railway station in a developing country.;1
Avoid this hotel. It is embarrassing that this is a Marriott/Bonvoy property. They need to unload this property ASAP. I have stayed at the Westin and Sheraton previously by LAX and while I knew this was a lower category I didn't realize how awful it would be. I have also stayed at four points in other locations in the US and abroad that have been good. But this place is disgusting. The hotel is falling apart and everything is dirty. The first room we were given the AC was broken. The second room wouldn't lock. The halls and rooms smell very strongly of weed. It doesn't feel safe or sanitary here. The workers at the front desk were nice, but they don't pick up the phone if you call from the room....;1
MAKE SURE you insist upon room with a window!  Yes, that's right! Would you expect to be allocated a room at the hotel's rear without a window - essentially, a cupboard with NO exterior/natural light!  Can you believe it?! And this wasn't simply a single overnight pre-flight visit!   C'Mon Sheraton - this is appalling! Not our first stay at this Four Points, but questionably one of [if not actually] the last.;2
Reading the reviews on trip advisor, I was not really looking forward to staying here, however as a brief stop to collect a car early morning it was the right price and location. My review is exactly as I experienced it: Staff were really helpful and friendly - especially while checking in, room was good and clean - a bit dated however perfectly acceptable. Pool and pool area was nice, bar area was good with attentive service and tasty food. We had water in the room and ice machines available on odd numbered floors. Bed was comfortable although we could hear people in the next room. As value for money, this was a good hotel.;4
The hotel looks pretty decent from the outside and in the lobby area, however, the room has very old furniture with no refrigerator.  Hence, the beds are good and the bathroom is clean and functioning well.;3
NOT SAFE AT ALL!  Do NOT stay at this HOTEL!!!  I WAS ROBBED while sleeping in my room with my children.  Our personal belongings were stolen and when we realized it, I tried to call 911 and the phone cord was taken out of the room.  I am a single mom and was targeted.  DO NOT STAY HERE!!  THE STAFF WAS HORRIBLE!!!  They do not care!!  Yes, I filed a police report.  If you are a mother or have kids, STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!;1
Not a food experience at all. Originally had booked a 4 night stay  but checked out after 1 night. The room wasn't the greatest but at least have a working ac. It was so hot but we got in late and was past midnight already so decided just stay the night and deal with it the next morning. There's only 1 person working at the front desk so when you phone down to try and get extra towels no one answers so you end up waiting in a long line up. Also the shower and sink would not drain. We checked out and got a room at the Hyatt. I would not stay at this hotel again. Only decent thing was the staff we nice.;1
the first room that was assigned to my party was smelly, we complained and were assigned to another room.  The next day, we discovered that the lock on the new room did not work, in other words, we were in a room, all night, that was not locked, AT ALL.  We were assigned another room, mind you this is the 3rd room in a matter of 3 days.  When we checked out, we were charged an additional 173.80, on BOTH CARDS, when we were told that we would receive a credit for one night, instead they charged us double for the credit that we were supposed to be credited for.  DON'T STAY THERE, I've notified my credit card company regarding this charge.;1
"Reception refused to acknowledge our booking confirmation and payment (confirmed by email, tax invoice, our airline, and charged to our credit card) which meant we were double charged for the room.  Appalling service, and all at 11pm after a whole day of travelling. Having read previous reviews, this hotel has a habit of being 'unable' to find reservations and double-charging guests. Further: 1) our room keys didn't work; 2) there was no soap in the room and the sink didn't drain; 3) there was a frightening verbal altercation at reception due to a guest being double charged for parking.  We continue to seek a refund and remain out of pocket $300.";1
This hotel is not what it seems from the photos and booking. Let’s start with the parking! $42 a night when you stay.  The rooms are dirty. Wasn’t sure they were cleaned. TVs don’t work. Smells like cigarettes and weed all over . They charge $4 for generic coffee and $16 for a crummy breakfast burrito. I guess if you like to think it’s fancy they charge crazy prices for crap!  I would never stay here. Everything is dirty and not maintained. They elevators are not clean at all. I feel like you’ll need a bath in alcohol to get the grim off.;1
We booked the night before flying to Hawaii as well as the night we returned (since we live in GA).  The first night was pretty bad…hot room thermostat at 82, would not cool down.  Finally changed our room…beds/pillows were awful but room was better.  We messaged via Bonvoy app after checkout and we’re assured our next stay would be better.  Upon check in we were told they didn’t have any notes/requests from me.   The room/bed size we booked was not available (so had 4 people in two double beds). If that wasn’t bad enough, my hotel profile says “away from elevators and ice machines”…they put us in a room right next to the ice machine AND the elevators.  We were exhausted and thought let’s just try to sleep through noise….walked in the room which smelled like someone just smoked;1
This is a very nasty hotel, please stay away. They assigned us to a room that was not clean at all. The staffs are very unprofessional. We checked out right after we saw the condition of our room, which was not clean at all from the previous guest stay. Stay away from Four Points at the Los Angelos  Airport location.;1
THe hotel pickups are at a specific area.  The signs inside the airport just point out into A area.  I had to ask a cop where it was as there was no help inside the airport.  At the pickup area 2 buses came by that had Sheraton on them.  Not the right place.  Was told in 4 min.  10 min later another one stopped.  Said he was not the one but would take me.  I just had to walk about a block to the Four points.  Check in was good.  On the 6th floor.  Clean room and had a fridge.  The phone had no dial tone. AC worked fine and not loud.  Went to the front desk to tell them about the phone and saw a computer.  It did not work  I asked if they had a business office and was told no.  I told them about the computer and phone.  I was told that way all the time.  I as told somebody would;4
Let’s skip past the run down rooms,  and jump to the shuttle service to and from the airport… going to the airport was fine, because you are standing in the lobby. The return trip was awful. We were the last stop (United) and were passed up by a full shuttle. Total time standing in the shuttle red zone… 1 hour.   Run more shuttles please.;1
the room I was in was so hot and the employees sent up a repair man and he WALKED AWAY WHEN WE WERE TELLING HIM OUR AC WAS BROKEN, our room was burning hot all night and the service was terrible, also the security outside was very rude. I would never be this mean in a review but this hotel was so bad 0/10 Would not come again also very dirty cleaning;1
Things started off well with an easy check-in process. But things took a turn when we tried to find room 659. The hotel is a maze which includes additional hazards like a random half flight of stairs if you are disabled. Signs such as rooms x - y (odd) to left other rooms to the right still were unhelpful and we spent 10 minutes going in circles until we found the room - which was more like a windowless jail cell since the hall is between the room and windows. So, unless you want the world to see your goings on, you'll need to close the curtain leaving you without natural light. The worst part was that the room smelled of cigarette smoke. That was the last straw - we ended up getting a refund and going to the Westin. Do not risk staying here - you'll waste your time at the very;1
This hotel appeared clean enough but it left much to be desired. The app and website stated that there were mini refrigerators in every room. We arrived to find that wasn’t the case. When I called to request one they stated they didn’t have any available. They said they put my name in to have one the following day, it never showed up.   The towel bar was pulling out of the wall and the tub stopper seemed to be broken.   I wouldn’t recommend staying at this hotel.;2
Location is close to LAX airport. They have a shuttle service. Checkin was alright. They recognized me as a Titanium member and offered late checkout (which I did not need). I asked about the free breakfast that I was supposed to get and it took me asking for them to tell me they did not have a restaurant !!! He offered that I could purchase breakfast at their Coffee shop. No apologies for not providing free vouchers to the coffee shop etc. Pathetic lack of customer service. Off the 3 elevators only 1 was working. One was stuck on Floor 4 and the one in the middle wasnt even lit up. Looooong waits if you want to use the elevator. They said there is coffee in the room. Went all the way to the room to find that all they had was DeCaf in the room. Another 15 minutes were wasted;1
"Was staying at the hotel for a night on June 4, 2022, as had a flight to catch the next day to Mumbai via Dubai. Chose the hotel only because of the location near the LA international airport.  The hotel is under staffed and you should be prepared to wait for more than 30 minutes (after on-line check-in) for your check-in and check-out.  On the hotel drive way there are people smoking weed as well in the lobby area, so if you are travelling with family and kids MUST AVOID  May be I am spoilt by the hotels in India, but the hotels in the USA do not provide, free parking, luggage assistance, complimentary wifi and host of other things which are standard for a hotel in India. Just for reference and cost comparison; if you stay at the ALoft (a Marriott signature hotel) at the New";1
Stayed overnight after a late arrival because this hotel, as well as its neighboring corporate brother Renaissance, are convenient to the rental car agencies nearby (Budget, Avis, Hertz). The Four Points was the cheaper of the two, but I probably should have splurged.  The first warning sign was the shuttle driver, who, despite having three empty seats, waved us off saying “there is an empty one right behind me”. There was, indeed, another shuttle right behind him, but we never got to find out if he was empty or not, as he simply sped by. The next shuttle took another 15 minutes to arrive.   The hotel has reception windows. One was staffed by a clearly overwhelmed front desk clerk. One more had a young gentleman who was in such a hurry to get out of there, that manners weren’t;2
At first impressions the hotel seems good enough to lay your head down to sleep. But check-in process has taken over an hour.  The line went to the door.  Think twice before booking unless you have an extra couple of hours before you get to your room.;1
Although plagued by the staffing shortages affecting all hotels at this time, this hotel is well-maintained with a good restaurant/bar and prompt shuttle service to/from LAX. A great value surrounded by three other Marriott properties . . .;4
The limited staff at this hotel was kind. The rooms were filthy and uncomfortable.  Restaurant/ Bar was very inconsistent about their hours and it was impossible and I get a hold of the front desk from your room. Skip this hotel. There are so many others.;2
On hold for central reservations at 12:00 am, hotel was booked due to flight cancellations.  Front desk supervisor who refused to give his name when he weaved a fairy tale.  Earlier he had told me to wait he will find a room.  In appreciation I gave he and his lady coworker 25 bundles of coffee collected from hotels plus each a Lindt Orange chocolate candy bar.  I presented my card and it was declined.  I called the credit card company and they had no record of any transaction declined.  At times like this the smart front desk people enter the card manually in their computer and it always takes.   As 4:00 am approached as was on hold for over an hour, I approached the desk and asked them to manually input the card.  They would not and asked me to leave.  At LAX I called back;1
"There seems to be a slew of 1-star extreme negative reviews in recent months, glad to say I did NOT experience any of the complaint. Rooms were clean, albeit a bit aged. No foul smell or homeless encampment as accused. Pillows were NOT flat. Staffs were all courteous and friendly, from front desk to the Brewster Bar. Can't comment on the shuttle, and parking was $42 + ""convenience fee"" of 4.20.";4
I am a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite member and booked my reservation via parksleepfly.com. I paid a portion of the bill via the website at the time of reservation and was to pay the remainder at the hotel. Ok, cool. Upon arrival, my reservation was unable to be found. Thankfully, the hotel staff did whatever it is they do to find it/ensure I had a room. Other than poor communication (I waited for 10 minutes at check-in while they were in the office) the experience was fine at that point. I was then told that my card was not on file, so I swiped it for the remainder. Upon checking out this morning, I requested a hard copy of my folio at which time I was told that my card was not on file again, so I swiped it again. This did not sit well so when I arrived at the airport I;1
I stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton near LAX after landing from SFO for my flight to NRT the following afternoon. It took a bit to find the shuttle stop at the airport but it arrived after maybe about 15 mins and took us right at the entrance, which was about a 10 min drive away.  As what most have described, check-in was a bit long with many travelers arriving late at night and two agents manning the front desk. I commend the staff on handling a few irate customers with various problems, as folks were tired and cranky.  As a Marriott Bonvoy Titanium Elite, I was neither offered an upgrade nor greeted as such in other hotels. I also did not receive the two bottled waters that were offered to other guests, though I noticed that it was mainly one agent who gave out the waters.;3
That the room are old and the obscene bathroom is the best thing about this hotel, but the front desck is awkward.  after three days I asked for a room service to change at least the towels, but They said that I asked for a service that is done only after 5 nights of stay.  the only positive thing are the Houskeeping, adorable and ready to serve the customer;1
What a hotel! It gets one star for the fact that I had somewhat of a decent sleep.  Aside, the shuttle service was awful. We waited forty minutes with many other confused people who were expecting one.  Secondly, the room was tidy, yet filthy. The bathroom was coated with a layer of dirt on the walls. Our telephone was not working initially to call them. And when we traced the line, we found rubbish under the table which had not been picked up.  The shower head was leaking and loose. Worst of all was that I reported this via the Marriott app 11 hours ago and it’s not even been addressed.  We’ve stayed in four Marriott hotels across our trip and this is by far, the worst hotel I’ve stayed out for shuttles, service and even acknowledgement. Yet I was charged over £150 for my room;1
Hotel smelt like a weed convention. Room smelt of weed, corridors smelt of weed.. walking through reception smelt of weed. If you like weed, you'll love this place.  Rooms were run down and could do with a little refresh. Could not open windows so had to rely on air conditioning.  I'd never say here again.;1
We stayed here before going overseas.  The check in time was decent.  People in line but were expedited quickly.  Our first room we had, a room change was needed due to wet carpet.  The second as well.  Apparently there was a flood on the floors above us and had soaked the carpet in the rooms adjacent.  But our third room was a hit. Plus we had the nicest security guard that escorted us to our room just in case. Roger was the security guard.  The food was definitely a plus. Prices were a bit higher than normal.  But I guess due to the inflation rate.  Overall it was a good stay and would recommend staying again.  Definitely choose a lower floor until they fix the rooms above.;5
It is your typical airport hotel. Nothing special but it served its purpose. We arrived at LAX and needed a place to crash before picking up our rental car nearby. We got there as the shuttle arrived so there was a line at check in but it moved reasonably well. We had a late dinner at their restaurant. Again, nothing amazing but it did the job. The room was fine though they had an extension cord duct taped to the floor at the threshold to our room. A little sloppy but not a big deal.;3
"We stayed at Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport at the beginning of April 2022 and it was extremely disappointing. The room was not cleaned properly, there was a condom wrapper in the nightstand drawer, the tub was clogged and the shower faucet was broken. The lines to check in were very long, the parking is $42 + tax per day and the parking area is really bad, almost no parking, it felt unsecure, and the small garage is horrible; if you drive a SUV or truck good luck parking in the small garage. Thank goodness we were there only one night,  I will never stay there again, I honestly believe we would have been better off at Motel 6 than at this hotel. It also felt like a very sketchy place. I will never recommend this place, they shouldn't be part of the";1
Arrived at LAX at midnight.  Every hotel shuttle appeared except for Four Points.  Finally after 1 hr wait, we took the shuttle to the Uber/taxi place, got to the hotel, saw the shuttle relaxing there with a driver.  Check in line was really long.  The hotel system was down.  They ended up checking people in by hand - writing down names, IDs, credit cards on a piece of paper!  It took us almost 3 hours from landing at LAX to getting into a room at this LAX hotel.  The bed was very comfy.  I'll give them that.;2
Un secure yet expensive parking.  Paid $46 for 6 hours of outdoor parking surrounded by homeless.  The fan was louder than the nearby airport.  Disgusting room in every way.  Please do not ask to contact Trevor.Stewart since it’s undeliverable.;1
I don't know why people gave this awful hotel star. They charged us $44 for the terrible parking which was uncovered and without securities. Our Tesla took bunches of pictures that homelessness wanted to open the door and get in, I am glad tesla is smart enough to put all cameras and the door is locked if we forget.  The very bad thing for other cars around us that the homeless could enter to the cat and super bad for Marriot. Stay awai from this hotel. Don't risk;1
Horrible place to stay and the front desk gives you minimal information about the hotel.  The guy that helped me said you can bring your ticket to the front to validate. Lol that’s a joke, They charged me $44. they can’t do anything about it. The room was outdated,  pillows were flat. Fortunately they give you four pillows to bed so I compensated a little. Room door was having a hard time staying closed. I rarely write reviews because I’ve worked in hotels before but hidden fees upset me very much. Avoid;1
The bad: Dated furniture and carpet, scratched furniture and doors, peeling wallpaper, loud wall-mounted A/C unit, damaged bath hardware and paper-thin bedding and towels, horrible tub drainage.    The good: pleasant staff, TV was fine, good water pressure and the bed was pretty comfy. 5 minutes to the airport.  The ugly: $44/night for parking in an uncovered lot, which is the same rate as non-hotel guests. And of course Marriott does tell you about it, but only in miniscule text on their website, so it's easy to miss.  Overall: It's fine. It's an airport hotel. You're probably staying here one night. But just be aware of what that means, especially if you have a car with you.;2
Scratched furniture, peeling wallpaper. This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in.  Plus, the AWEFUL smell of chemicals when I first entered the room. May look nice on the outside, but it’s NOT all that it seems. Definitely not worth the price.;2
I have suffered through this budget airport parking for long enough now after 2-3 years. I have parked there 3 times this month. Although this is one of the closest and more reasonably priced parking lots near LAX the service is just too lacking. More often than not, I have trouble either scanning in or out of the lot with the QR code on my phone. This must be a common issue, because recently they have a gate assistant out there - still no fun when you have a car or two behind you trying to get out of the only exit. Last week my entire family waited 45 minutes for a shuttle bus at Lax which allegedly run every 30 minutes. The latest excuse was that “traffic was heavy”. Well, send more buses so you stay on time - not rocket science. As we waited we saw numerous buses from the;1
We stayed at this hotel recently.  We chose it because our flight was getting in very, very late and we wanted a hotel close to the airport after a long flight.  We really didn't explore the hotel since we were only there less than 24 hours.  But it is close to the airport and is walking distance to 1 or 2 rental car locations.  Kudos to the management staff for taking care of our needs.;2
The downstairs lobby was nice. However, when I checked into my room it was a different story. The bathtub wouldn't stop leaking, the room was outdated, the tub had rust stains, and the room had a smell.   What made me furious was the mold on the wall and the curtains. When I pulled the curtains back to look out the window, there was MOLD! That is unacceptable and in my opinion the room/hotel need to be condemned before someone get sick or worse!;1
I stayed here twice. I honestly don't see what a lot of reviewers are complaining about. It did take a while to get checked in at midnight on a weeknight on my first stay, but they had 3 clerks working (more than I expected) and they did a perfectly good job. Keep in mind we are just now coming out of a pandemic in which many hospitality workers lost their jobs and restaffing has been difficult. It also seemed a few people had never checked into a hotel before- the stupidity was thick among the guests in line. I had zero issues checking in or out.  Yes, it does cost $44/night to park a car, but it costs about that at all the hotels near LAX. I wish I'd known that going in, but now you do.  My first room didn't have a USB charger by the bed. Guess what? I plugged my phone into;3
"Booked through expedia and because of my marriot membership I kept the reservation and did not cancel at the deadline and mainly because I did not expect it  to be this bad. Pictures are outdated. Attempted to call front desk to ensure room is reserved as I was arriving in very late; that took 85 minutes. Arrived and gentlemen at the desk was polite but shared that only doubles were available and did manage to find one king. Room looks like red roof inn location; pillow cases were not changed; garbage can full. No soap for washing hands and 2 towels were left. Very disappointed and I hope this place is forced to refurbish.";1
Just a one night stay at the 4 Points Marriott LAX. Met by Jose at the front desk. Kind professional and understanding, Due to several issues I was very upset with management and voiced my complaints to the assistant mgr Maria. But then it dawned on me. The staff is doing their best to work with what they are given. For a run down old hotel , it is relatively clean. The towels are old and thin but clean. Most hotels have a charging station by the bed, the 4 points is across the room. No bathroom amenities, like soap , shampoo, lotion they must have a very low budget. One out three elevators work. My sister stopped by and as she exited the pay park the pay machine was not working, so security was present assisting in taking cash payments. The restaurant opened at 4:00 but we were;1
"I pre-paid a reservation for a room, arrived at the hotel, and was told there were no rooms available.  I slept on a couch in the lobby before returning to the airport for the remainder of the night.  Then--my credit card was charged twice for the room.  A hotel manager said that neither of the charges would be refunded because I did not show for the room and did not cancel.  The manager said that he would contact the desk agents and find out what happened and respond--I did not get a response--so assumed the charges would be refunded.  They were not.  Several weeks later, during a second inquiry to the hotel, another manager said it was hotel ""policy"" not to turn patrons away and that their records showed they there was a room available.  Unfortunately for me--policy or not--I";1
We only had a couple of nights in LA and found this to be most geographically convenient for us. This hotel has many conference rooms so it can get quite busy in the lobby, etc. The staff is friendly. The workout area is very small but adequate for a cardio/weights session. Nothing remarkable about this hotel. It’s centrally locates so very easy to get to various highways. Many convenience stores surrounding. I would stay again if we needed to stay close to the airport.;3
Good news: well located 5 minutes from LAX and across the street from Budget car rental and a few blocks from AVIS and Hertz.  Good bed and shower.  Bad news: property is very tired snd worn.  Lighting is hot white LED which gives the place an industrial feel…definitely not warm and welcoming, particularly in the rooms.  Virtually no amenities.  For breakfast, best they can muster is a heated burrito.   Gym is tiny and poorly equipped.  Many dumbbells missing, rust on the equipment, benches showing wear and tear.  If you simply need a bed, ok.  Otherwise give this a miss.  And certainly not worth more than the basic rack rate (avoid if there is surcharging rates due to events like the Super Bowl).;2
Do not stay here!! My girlfriend and I stayed here TWO nights- booked through Expedia. First impression, the room was dirty. There was hair in the shower and on the photo frame in the bathroom. The shower curtain was covered in mold. As with every hotel, they have your card on file for emergencies. No big deal. BUT THEY CHARGED ME FOR THREE EXTRA NIGHTS. I saw it go through on my bank and called- the person I talked to (forgot his name) said I was charged for the three extra nights I stayed. I explained I did not stay three extra nights and only stayed the two that were on my Expedia reservation. I offered to show rental car receipts and flight details. The man was very rude, did not listen to me and said no I stayed five nights and hung up. THAT IS NOT TRUE! I called my bank;1
We had fine service. However we started there with a hotel voucher from the airline and we ended up getting a bill. In trying to correct it we have called many times and left voicemails with no return call. We have also sent multiple emails with no response. This is horrible business p practice.;1
One of the worst hotels I’ve ever stayed in. #1 The front desk never answers the phone #2 The front desk never responds to guests texts through the Marriott app. #3 Good luck trying to get the airport shuttle, the driver never stopped! Drive right by, I had to step into a lane of traffic to flag him down 25 mins after he first drove by, then it’s a death ride to the hotel #4 From the moment you step off the shuttle, the hotel smells like weed, really gross #5 The rooms are beyond outdated and gross, mold, hair, peeling paint in the bathroom, ac had an odor coming out of it and there were stains on the bed sheets and carpeting #6 OVERALL DISGUSTING   This hotel has the feel of a bad 80’s hotel where patrons would pay by the hour…  STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!;1
I am a lifetime Marriott Titanium member and I cannot remember ever being this dissatisfied with a Marriott hotel. Lesson learned, check TripAdvisor reviews before booking and stick to the original Marriott owned properties and avoid the Sheraton acquired properties.  My daughters and I had a flight delay which caused us to overnight at LAX. I used the Marriott app and found a hotel with availability near LAX and the agent said it had a free shuttle and provided us the phone number. We waited an hour for the shuttle and it never came. We called the shuttle and hotel numerous times with no answer, after 45 minutes the hotel finally answered and confirmed we were waiting in the correct spot. After waiting an hour we looked up the hotel next door and hopped on the shuttle for that;1
How on earth this place can claim to be a Four Points brand hotel is beyond me.  Firstly, the incredibly loud humming of the air conditioner unit (even though I turned mine off) was so loud it was hard to sleep.  The elevators are extremely slow and are filthy inside with graffiti through it.  Not only that, you wait for ages for the elevator to arrive.  Outside in the main car drop off area, ferals and homeless regularly hang around the entrance.   The restaurant downstairs had very few items In the menu, however they were also extremely overpriced.;2
It says on smoking bit it was not. Someone had definitely smoked in our room. Dark and dingy. No services. Shuttle was good. Close to the airport. Used a free night. Marriott free nights are usually at the worst hotels.;2
Stayed two nights with family of four.  Hotel is obviously short staffed.  20+ minutes to check in.  Only one receptionist handling everyone.  Lots of rude customers.  First room AC wasn’t able to cool room below 78.  Second room got down to 73.  Engineering staff was very polite but said that’s the best it gets in this facility.  Hard to believe since the hallways were more comfortable than rooms.    Both rooms we tried smelled like smoke.    No microwaves for guest use in the hotel!  That was a shocker for a family trying to warm up kid’s meal’s and snacks.  No microwaves is definitely a poor management issue.  The airport shuttle driver’s were very helpful and timely.  The facility is definitely worn and heavily used.  Definitely not the normal condition I assume under the;2
Ok Hotel for the price,  but bathroom needs maintenance. Needs very good including feather pillows. Breakfast bag with content that is in par with US: coffee, orange juice. sausage sandwich, apple, banana and granola bar. I suppose the Hotel has been refurbished som years ago.;3
Stayed for one evening. Nice hotel. The staff was courteous, the airport transfer was quick and easy and the room was clean and neat.  The shower drain was clogged. I reported it on my way out. I am assuming it was taken care of.  Overall, an enjoyable stay and I would stay there again.;4
This is typical airport hotel. What they don’t tell you is that they have people I quarantine  from Cruises and they are all over the place. You would assume they would reserve an entire floor but instead they are all over. We had a room on the 6th floor and in the rooms right  in front and right next to us there were people with COVID. Plus they actually leave the room and wander around without masks. Thankfully we just stayed a night.   TDLR don’t stay here unless you want to get COVID;1
COVID Epicenter - We only stayed for one night but when where leaving we noticed that ALL our floor was full with COVID quarantine people, they where doctors nocking doors with Hazmat suits, is so IRRESPONSIBLE to allocate guest in the same floor even next to those who are in lockdown. This hotel is very irresponsible in doing that!;1
Expect to see ladies of the night and their dates in the bar, lobby bathrooms screwed shut, night security officers getting high outside, employees getting high on their breaks in the parking lot, thieves casing you on the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel asking questions to see if you might have something they can steal, toothless men who are not hotel guests wandering the halls, rolling joints in the lobby and smoking them outside who pull the race card when daytime security officer tried to inquiry about his hotel patron status and verify he should be there in the first place (doing his job to keep the actual guests safe and comfortable with their surroundings), watching a woman get arrested and taken out the door in handcuffs by 6 policemen, having your car broken;1
A few nights ago I was a guest at your hotel. I proceeded to check out the next afternoon since I had a flight to catch. However, my flight was at midnight and therefore I decided that instead of going to the airport 9 hours early, to spend a few hours in the lobby of the hotel I had just spent the night at. As the hotel lobby is FREEZING, I asked the front desk for a towel in order to stay warm. They replied with “you’re not a hotel guest anymore so we cannot give you a towel”. I was completely caught off guard and insulted with the thought of the staff “not considering me a guest” three hours after I checked out, yet they seemed more than happy to take my credit card the night prior (not to mention they had only one of our two rooms booked). As I lay near the windowsill;2
No frills and basic, but certainly a more than adequate option for a layover at Los Angeles International. The place looks a little bit ‘tired’, but the rooms are certainly big enough and have all the basic amenities. They even have a fridge and microwave. The hotel just doesn’t possess that immediate sparkle…However, that said, my stay for overnight was very keenly priced and that aided a comfy sleep.;4
Horrible service..even housekeeping person said “I don’t know how they’re still in business, they have terrible service”.  Called for iron and towels and 90 minutes and 3 calls later, I’m still waiting with an event to attend for which I needed the iron! Coffee and creamers available but no stirrers. Tiny 32” tv in a giant room, too far to see. No parking available but paying $42/night. Parking ticket never worked even after validation.  Completely flat worn pillows on bed, bath towels are barely larger than hand towels. Booked 2 separate rooms, told them to change billing on one to the other couple, who gave their card upon check in- they still billed it all to me. Rooms are old and outdated. Expected much better from a Marriott Bonvoy property. This place doesn’t deserve the;1
I decided to fly to Los Angeles earlier than I planned so I booked my daughters and I for a 2 night stay using my Bonvoy app. It was near LAX. And since we flew for 12hours, we were more than glad to finally be able to rest.   Check in didn't take long and the front desk agent was very helpful. The only open place onsite was some sort of a pub . The front desk agent was very helpful when I asked about nearby restaurants or convenience stores. She pointed out a new Target nearby which was 5mins away via Uber.  The elevators reeked of weed. When we got to the room and tried opening the door, the keycard worked but the door would not open. I had to use the hall phone and ask for help. After a couple of tries, I was able to open the door by almost kicking it. It seemed as though it;1
Quite a few negative things:  1. 2 of our 4 nights stay had fire alarms go off in the middle of the night. (12/23/2021, 12/26). Walking down 9 flights of stairs in the cold wasn't fun. 2. Guests must pay for parking: $44 a day. 3. Our keys kept on becoming invalidated. Two occasions when are keys simply stopped working, and we had to go to the front desk, wait in line, and be handed new keys. 4. Furniture, rooms are a bit outdated/old.;1
Wish i can give this hotel minus four stars!! This is the worst hotel i ever stayed at !! Our check in took for ever only one desk clerk waited over 30 min and Every time me and my girlfriend wanted to go to the room or leave it needed to wait for the elevator more then 15 - 20 min so we just had to take the stairs multiple times. no towels in the room Upon arrival. And every time we used the phone in the room to get some kind of room service no one answers very frustrating lets not talk about the over charge parking for each night here never coming back here !!!                           B E W A R E ! ! !;1
My family and I were stranded after Our fights were canceled.  We thought this would ne okay based on the name. This hotel is a farce of an establishment.  It does not match what is on the room photos for advertisement.  We were moved 3 times for various reasons. 1. Room smoked out, couldn't breath. Rooms in back were motel 6 accommodations, and leaks, no water running in one room period. 3 room no air, temp never went below 77 degrees. Thermostat on the wall didn't work.  Just a horrible  experience to the end of a good family trip.  We will never stay hear again. I will be calling corporate.;1
I travel quite a bit and I have to think back ten years to find an experience this bad.  The entire hotel is very tired.  We visited a week ago, arriving about midnight.  The heat didn't work and we were too tired to call maintenance.  It was a rare cold day in LA and the room was in the low 60's.  We alerted the desk to the problem upon checkout.  A few days later my boyfriend happened to get the same room and specifically asked if the heat was working.  He was assured it was, and had the exact same freezing night.  No do-not-disturb tags are not available, and trying to sleep after flying all night was impossible as housekeeping kept on trying to enter. My car doesn't have a bathroom but it does have working HVAC, so sleeping in it would have been about as comfortable.;1
I had a really disappointing experience at this hotel on Dec 13 check-in. The rooms were overbooked so we were forced to wait at 9 pm for an hour for our rooms.  I asked the desk staff what the issue was and she said it was rooms overbooking, but she had the keys in her hand and was waiting on her manager (Randall) to release. I asked her again afterwards what the issue was and she said they were trying to figure it out but didn't know, and I could reach out to Randall.  We arrived exhausted and late after a flight but being unable to check-in was frustrating. This isn't the level of service I expected from this hotel chain.  I would add that both our rooms were loud from the highway, my window wasn't even fully closed when I entered the room, and my room clock was set one hour;1
United Air paid for our room for the night due to a flight cancellation. I had to give them my credit card # for incidentals. They charged my card for the room 2 days later on top of United paying for it. I left 3 messages with accounting and no one returned my call. I finally got help from their party planner who told me the refund would go through. That was a month ago and still no refund. Avoid this hotel! If anything goes wrong with payment they will make no attempt to correct fraudulent charges!;1
Hotel with few services and very sloppy for room delivery. Poorly maintained hotel for the price they offer should be much better care and service. In my case refrigerator and room entrance light did not work. Room also had no coffee, etc.  poorly assembled and (not reviewed the room).     If you are in the area look for another option if you can. Do not hesitate.;1
Hotel is dirty! My room clearly wasn’t clean- drawers left open, trash cans clumped together, microwave moved away from wall but the kicker was the jacket in the closet from the previous guest. No I take that back- the kicker was when I called the front desk who said I could call housekeeping and ask if it was clean, which I did, no answer. Then I called the manager on duty, strait to voice mail, so I’m left here with uncertainty if even my bed linens were changed and a stranger’s clothing in my closet;1
room smelled horrible, had to call security on our neighbors who were partying until 5 am, shower flooded and tub did not drain. Hotel parking lot was close to 50 / night - much more expensive than covered garages at nicer hotels in the area. Recommend spending a bit more money for a much better value in an LAX airport.;2
"Where do I begin? Landed at LAX for a layover to the portal of hell that they call the Four Points Sheraton. The Shuttle never arrived after an hour of waiting. Sure, the lobby is nice but don't let it deceive you. IT'S A TRAP. RUN. The rooms are triple deed: dark, dirty, and dingy. The bathroom furnishing was nice until I turned on the shower and pube hairs came shooting out from under the tub drain like a bunch of baby spiders. :( I opted for a ho-bath in the sink, instead. The bed was okay. The curtains were stained mysterious colors, and the ceiling had water spots over the bed which concerned me.   The real issue with the 4 Points is that they held my deposit for a month, and claimed that my ""card declined"" after checkout...  I went back and forth for over a month to get my";1
Trevor, in particular, was extremely accommodating.  I had a problem and he went out of his way to help me out, which made my day.  The staff was also very friendly, and I think the hotel is Dog friendly because I saw a lot of dogs in the hotel.  I stayed here because it was close to the airport.  The room was good and I thought the bed was comfortable for me.;5
It’s just a matter of time.  Either a massive upgrade or Marriott dumps them.  Rooms and hotel in need of massive upgrade.  Heater in room didn’t work. Outlets with no covers.  Wallpaper falling off the all. Furniture stained and scratches.  Hotel shuttle driver said only one driver “because they are so cheap”.  Hour wait for pickup.  Unhelpful check in “we check on at 2” I was told despite many open rooms and finally was accommodated.  I know it’s LA but tattoos on all fingers etc with attitude isn’t what made Marriott a brand.;2
"Overall my stay was satisfactory.  My first room 356, was fair.  It was clean, but the darkness of the room was unsettling. ( The only window, was a ""view ""of the hallway)I know there is nothing they can do, but that is my experience.  The privacy shade would not operate, it could not be pulled all the way down.  I contact the manager on duty, he tried to fix the shade, and was not able to.  He changed my room without any hassle.  My next room 608 was much better.  The window faced the outside and thus i had some daylight in the room.  Waited over 45 minutes for the airport shuttle; it never showed.  took a nearby shuttle and walked to the hotel.  We were a group of 6. Check in was very slow.  Granted it was past 11pm (delayed flight arrival) but we were not the only ones in";2
So first when we went into the hotel there was a huge line with no one at the front desk to help us, then we went to see room it immediately smelt like cigarettes, the bathroom had dirt on the walls, the toilet was dirty, the light fixtures had dirt on it, the carpet was nasty like not kidding you could see old dirt and food on it,  the window had dust dirt and grind, AND DONT get me started on how hard and stale the bed was I am a single mother with a kid you think I have time to wake up on a dam hard prison bed. The bed sheets were also dirty the door had a seal on it WTF?!? I would never wish this pain on my worst enemy I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!!             From an unhappy 🙁 customer;1
Checked in September 27/2021 prepaid with Groupon when we got home we discovered our credit card was also charged for one night stay. Emails are not being returned no one answers the phone. Check in process was horrible.  Could not find reservation then brushed us off;1
Where do I start? the room was old and with a musty smell. The furniture was coming apart. This property does not meet the Marriott standards. The garbage can by the elevator was so dirty. Amazingly enough when we checked in a pilot was upset because his room had not been clean.;1
I stayed at this Hotel August 3-5th and was disappointed over and over again. They do not have washers and dryers as advertised and have charged me $118.00 without an explanation. I have called them again, and again over a week, the first time they answered they claimed it was due to using a third party to reserve the rooms (I used T-mobile), I contacted T-Mobile and they contacted the Hotel. The Hotel claimed it was a hold charge and would be removed in a few business days. I waited and the charge was still there. This is not a damage hold charge (which was $75.00 and $74.00 for each room). When I called again, the employee had difficulty finding a reason to why I was charged the $118.00. She said James from the financial Dep. could help. I called James during the hours she;1
Horrible hotel and service, dirty, and old. Will never stay here.  As soon as we checked into the room, it had a moldy smell and carpet was clearly not properly cleaned. Small flies were all over the room and bathroom  Pillows were uncomfortable, called front desk, room service, housekeeping from 7pm till 10pm with no answer. Sent a request from the app, it was answered the following morning. Bathroom ceiling had mold spots all over. In the morning, we turned a pillow over and it had black spots (looks like mold) all over 1 side.  Guests should not be worried about COVID, you will get sick from how dirty everything is in this hotel;1
NO CRIBS AVAILABLE- Landed after a red eye from LAX with our 6month old. They said this is because their housekeeping is gone for the night. How ridiculous is it that they apparently “cannot access” their cribs ?!?! Either they’re lying or they have no clue how to share staff keys & roles 🙄🙄;1
Against my better judgment I allowed my friend to book us at this hotel. The only good thing we can say is that the staff was super friendly and kind. However, the hotel in general is falling apart and in desperate needs of renovations... looks more like a Motel 6 than a property owned by Marriott.;1
Stayed here for one night paid over 100$ for the room plus their outrageous 40$ Parking fee just to park in the building. Not even 30 minutes of being in my hotel room I get up and see a roach running away. I called the front desk to report this issue and receptionist said the house keeper would come to catch the roach. What the hell is that? I had to go back and forth with him about it and eventually he agreed to give me the parking for free as a discount for the roach problem. Still paid full price for my coachroach infested room. Not right. Do not stay here. It looks nice but it’s deceiving.;1
The location was great, the staff was excellent. only had one down fail was the parking was a bite excessive and hardly worked. I think they should lower to $25  for over night guest. and a Grab and go breakfast like muffins and a fruit;4
"Shuttle driver Frank (that's the name he told me) was racist, sexist, overall offensive, most uncomfortable and awkward shuttle ride I have ever had. I took a shuttle from the hotel to the airport on Oct. 8, 2020 around 1:50pm. As I board Frank wouldn't let me on, I figured it wasn't time yet, he makes a joke and says I can't get on because ""where's the rest of your luggage"" I told him I travel light and my backpack is all I have. He says ""you're a girl you're supposed to have all this make up and tons of bags"", I was off put but his judgement already but I brushed it off as some awkward joke. As I board the shuttle Frank goes ""you're right you don't need make up you're very beautiful"", as much as he meant it as a compliment it was just random and I started to feel very";1
3.30am and have had no sleep. The hotel is being used as a bikers rave with full on party in the car park below. Waited 40 mins for the shuttle bus. Place stinks of dope. Elevators in dire need of refurbishment. Room old and tired - visibly stained towels. Stay somewhere else and do yourself a favor;1
I spent one night here on a long layover at LAX.  I needed to stretch after sitting on a plane for so long and did not really want to figure out the shuttle situation (LAX gives me a headache enough as is) so I ended up just walking to the hotel.  It was a little less than a mile away.  There are a couple cafes and some places to get food around the hotel.  Customer service at the hotel was great and they did a good job adhering to covid safety when I was there back in June.  The room itself was pretty nice, the A/C worked great.  No complaints.  The shuttle took about 20 minutes to arrive in the morning to take everyone to the airport.;5
"I had to travel during the Covid 19 quarantine mess.  The Airline cancelled many flights - so I had no connection to my destination and required an over night - barely 10 hours. I arrived at night - no view of property outside; and all amenities were closed - due to covid.  The Staff was very helpful and friendly, and the property inside seemed very clean, shiny floors, fixtures ... .  I made the reservation on my phone curbside at airport - but the Hotel still hadn't received the res. until at least 20-30 mins after my arrival at the Lobby.";4
The room was fine and the shuttle service to the air port was handy.  From the airport you could take the train to any place in LA  for  a dollar.   The bar had good food and reasonable prices.   You could walk to a convience store.  the;3
I stayed here upon recommendation from an airline when I missed a connecting flight. I called to book and paid, then when I arrived, the front desk attendant was very rude and said there was no record of it and I would have to pay again. I was charged twice and had to make several calls over two days to have one of the charges removed. The front desk also informed me that I only had 5 minutes prior to the restaurant closing at 10, which the bartender told me was incorrect and they remained open a couple more hours, including for food. The room smelled musty and like stale cigarette smoke. Very disappointing experience for a name brand Sheraton hotel.;2
Hotel is nice and close to the airport with a shuttle that goes frequently. Front desk service was good. When I walked into my room which was right right in front of the elevator I immediately smelt smoke. It smelt like it had been smoked in many times. I opened up the window to air it out and noticed an empty orange juice bottle behind the chair. I called down to the front desk to request a new room but no one answered the phone. I was tired and jet lagged so I couldn’t be bothered to go down to the front desk so I sucked it up and went to bed. In the morning when I walked out of my room it smelt horribly of marijuana and the garbage can in front of the elevator was overflowing. I was happy to be leaving. Smoke in the rooms and hallways is unacceptable and I will not recommend;2
My experience here was nothing short of 5+ stars.  I accidentally left a garment bag in my room and with tremendous help from Paulina & Monica at the from desk, I was able to recover my belonging.  Not only were both Paulina & Monica a dream to interact with, but their willingness to go way above the measure of reasonable expectable was truly remarkable.  These ladies are outstanding representatives of the Marriott family of hotels and should be recognized for their excellence!!;5
The hotel is located just 10 minutes from LAX airport. The have a free shuttle in every 20-30 minutes. The rooms are spacious and the bed is comfortable. The cleanliness is average. The pool is good... the property is non smoking, so if you are a smoker you can do that only in the designated area in the front of the building at the left hand side. The breakfast is really good, tha staff is very friendly but I missed the vegetables ( tomato, cucumber and some cheese and meat) Overall, it is a good choice if you wanna stay near the airport.;3
I frequently stay at this Four Points in Los Angeles and I’m always pleased. Friendly staff, modern clean and quiet rooms. This location is close to all the wonderful beaches and places in Los Angeles.;4
I stayed for 6 nights at this property for a meeting and then a mini-vacay with family. The meeting rooms were perfect for what we needed and convenient. The rooms were clean, perfect temperature and quiet. I did have some billing issues that were cleared up. The only downside to this location is if you don't have a car, it is SUPER expensive to uber or cab anywhere. We couldn't get an uber because it was such a busy area. Parking rates are sky high. You can walk to someplace to eat, but plan on walking a mile or so. The restaurant in the hotel is pretty good though and reasonable.;5
We stayed here one night to catch an early flight out of LAX - which is basically the only reason you would want to stay here. Property is just ok. Lobby more updated than the rooms, which have thin pane windows and teeny dated bathrooms. But....they are pet friendly! Yay!   Tip: Get a room facing the pool area rather than the front of hotel as there is noise from valet, busy road, etc.   Tip:  Although you are super close to LAX, plan on it taking at least 20 minutes to get to a terminal due to crazy traffic.;3
The staff were very nice, helpful and made us feel welcomed. From the check-in process (found a room ready hours before check-in) , Musie Kahsay, who went out of his way to suggest ride options and point us in the right direction,  to the staff at luggage check and the gift shop, all were pleasant and kind.  I would give 5 stars but the room was a tiny bit outdated. Although I must note, it was very clean.;4
We stayed here while waiting for our next flight. It’s fine. It’s clean, beds comfortable, a bit noisy but for an overnight it’s fine. We stayed in room 570. Staff were polite and courteous. We didn’t use the pool but it looked fine;3
Overall really good costumer service We were greeted by the best guest service Musie Kahsay. His social capabilities and care made us feel as if we were at home. He recommended many destinations for us to visit and made this L.A. hotel experience amazing! Thank you Musie!!;4
Stayed for 1 night on Jan 13th.  The front desk staff that checked me in was very nice.  I stayed in room 653.  Room was tired looking.  Desk chair was very worn.  The thermostat in my room did not work.  It automatically would go to 85F and I could not change it.  I ended up just leaving it off all night.  The walls are paper-thin.  I heard the person next-door snoring for a solid 30 minutes straight and it was like they were in the room with me.  I've stayed at most of the hotels located within a couple of blocks so I will likely stick to those in the future.;3
This is my second time staying here. Awesome place and staff. I can confirm a second time—great place to stay. Great for families and businesses. So much going on. They had a graduation for transformational motivation and World of Dance meetings. The business area conference rooms and ballrooms are huge! The staff handles everything you could want. Valet and self parking. See pic for prices. Nice breakfast area and bar/restaurant. They have a small “to go” area for snacks and coffee. I used self parking and stayed in the back. The exercise room and pool are very nice. The hotel is right across from budget rental. And well located near airport. I could not hear the planes or neighbors. The shower is fantastic!! The room was large and nice but the bathroom was a little small. It;4
Okay, the staff is extremely nice and very efficient and knowledgeable.  But the rooms are dismal, the carpet dirty (keep your socks on), the furniture worn and dated   The bedding and towels are plentiful and clean. But the bath hasn’t been updated in decades, and sports warped doors.  It’s REALLY overpriced.;2
It is not a pleasant place to say. There are better LAX airports. This one has few redeeming features. The rooms are not that big, and they look tired and in need for a serious refurbishment. The toilette is pretty ugly and should be renovated. It is not a disaster for one night (and nobody stays for longer) but there are better in the vicinity, and even next door.  Staff were courteous and they allowed me to check in earlier.;3
"I travel frequent to Los Angeles and when I do I try my best to stay at this property.  Let me first by starting off by saying the staff is amazing! This includes the front desk staff, restaurant crew, all the way to housekeeping.  I can honestly say out of all the properties I have stayed at over the years I am the most fond of this staff.    I have stayed at this property for almost 6 years now and each stay has been pleasant.  I am quite surprised at some of the negative comments I read regarding this property.  True this hotel may not be the most up to date property, however I have never experienced any mishaps that would make me not want to stay at this hotel.  The rooms are nice and always clean.    Furthermore whatever ""modern"" features, as one reviewer put it, this hotel";5
The hotel is hopelessly outdated. The room had mattresses that were worn out and hopelessly curved in the middle. Two light bulbs were burned out of the four the illuminated the room. Ugly old carpet and furniture coverings seemed to be clean. The bathroom was generally very clean and brightly lighted. The lights for the bathroom were in timers though and would go out before you were done. The tub seemed to have a connection to the room next toor and would gurgle water when the neighbor used his tub. The room temperature could not be adjusted. It always reverted to its prior selection as soon as you let it go. The elevator arriving lights didn’t work The promised mini fridge was non - existent. And the phone hand set didn’t work.  The staff seemed very nice as was the shuttle;2
At this location, you get what you pay for. Nothing fancy, very standard with clearly outdated rooms. However, does offer a less expensive option if staying one or two nights by the airport. The shuttle to the airport was very nice and prompt!;3
Alejo the valet manager was extremely helpful. Would come back just based on his customer service. Was helpful and went above and beyond for my family and would easily give him five stars based on his service;5
A very nice hotel clean beds everything look at nice hot showers staff was very friendly my wife and I enjoyed our time here I would say parking is a little rough but shorter than that we had a lovely time;4
We had a wonderful dinner at Brewsters Bar in the 4 Points Sheraton. Not only did we have a tasty dinner with everything just as we ordered, the service by Marco G was so outstanding I felt compelled to let his boss know how much we appreciated him.  The place was packed but he still found time to check back with us several times, bringing fresh drinks. He was friendly but still professional. As far as our room, it was very comfortable and clean. The front desk, bellman and tour guide desk were all very friendly and helpful. We  booked an all day  tour of LA that was fabulous. I will definitely use this hotel whenever I fly out of LA and have a stop over.;5
The location is excellent if you want you stay close to LAX and need access to car rentals, most of which are just a mile away.  However, - Parking is exorbitantly priced at $35 per night. - No complimentary breakfast - Super old rooms with not so pleasant vibes - The WiFi was terribly unstable and slow. And guess what, pay for higher speeds.  Further, I needed a quick meeting room and wasn’t able to get one. So much for advertised facilities.  Overall, not worth the money as you can find similar priced places for better worth.;3
We had an 8am flight and did not want to chance the traffic in the morning so we got a room at Four Points.   The location is good, the value was good and the place looks nice.  The negative part would be the loud street noise.  Not sure how often the sirens go down that street but it was a very busy night.  Also, could hear regular street traffic which could keep you awake or wake you.   The airpost shuttle was excellent!!;3
Stayed at this hotel for the second time this year as it is a great place to stay if you are in layover mode. The rates are cheap. They even have a day rate where you can rent a room from 10am - 5pm for almost half the price of a full nights stay. The hotel is always clean and the staff are super friendly. The food is yummy too and the free airport shuttle makes life easier for sleepy travellers. The only downsides are that you have to pick up your food order yourself from the restaurant as they don't offer room service, and the place is a little old so not super fancy but for the price, you get more than you paid for. Will stay again.  A nice touch was the two bottles of comp water.;4
Don’t stay here if you want efficient shuttle service.  They run two an hour vw their competitors who run every 10 mins.  Also Marriott bought them and they are THE worst treat their staff and customers like crap.;1
Been here Twice now & EVERYBODY has been out of this world Helpful, Attentive Amaazing! I mean EVERYBODY!! Starting fron the the front @ Valet!! the people @ front desk, greeters inside, the security,  I mean you name it. But a super shout out to the VALET TEAM!! Last year it was Victor Valencia, today it was Omar & his counterpart, & now its Alejo, who is phemonenal! Super polite, genuine, attentive,& helped me expidite a situation with the utmost manners & professionalism.  You can tell he is well versed in hus position & has management/Boss written all over him with the BEST custommer service ever!  Seriously, THANK YOU Four Points LAX you are the BEST!!;5
We spent 24 hours in LA on the way to the east coast.  The staff were friendly and the room very nice and comfortable. We caught the number 3 bus from half a block away which took us straight to the Santa Monica pier and back. There were also a couple of places to eat less than 2 blocks away. We would definitely stay here again for an overnighter.;5
If you’re looking for a nearby hotel and affordable with close proximity to LAX, I would recommend this property. The staff were very welcoming, our groups had to have our luggages on hold upon arrival and before departure and they accommodated our luggages on two occasions!  The property also has a few restaurant establishments and if you’re on a business trip around the area - one do not have to go far. There’s a sit down breakfast buffet and one grab and go called Valentine ( open all day ) that serves coffee, pastries and light sandwiches. They also have just a FREE stand alone coffee stand in the morning if you’re just needing that caffeine boost ! The furnishings in the room is dated but clean ! I’m good with that !;4
My visit to the hotel was great because of the amazing customer service from the valet Maria. Some days the little things in life make all the difference and her kindness has helped my week end on a positive note. Thanks Four Points!;5
I stayed here for a while and I met a Valet attendant named samuel he was very helpful called me by my name and every question I had he answered for me. He has made my stay so much better! He’s a very nice person and always helps I see him helping everyone and every time he saw me he helped me with either luggage or even a short conversation. He is an amazing person and he made me feel like I was at home. Thank you to whoever hired him.;5
I had used 4 Points Sheraton in the past long ago and tried this time when several methods of getting toLAX had fallen through.  Alejo arranged to help me get Parking, even went so far as to walk me in to the concierge to get the parking arranged.  He also helped me with my luggage and getting on the shuttle.  He realized better than I that if I didn’t park and get to the airport terminal that I was not going to make that vacation.  He and the shuttle driver both could teach lessons in customer service.  Thank you again for such great service.;5
The hotel itself could use some upgrades and a little renovation, but the staff more than makes up for what the rooms are lacking. It was my initial room that brought me to the front desk seeking Myra’s assistance. I was less than pleased with its ratty furniture and overall worn down appearance, however clean. Myra did not hesitate to offer me another room option & even offered me the chance to check it out before making the move. She enlisted Marvin in guest services to show me around and he was absolutely accommodating & couldn’t have been friendlier. I made the switch and it made all the difference in my stay. I had a pleasant evening from there and woke up ready to continue my travels. I also must mention that I forgot my phone charger at home and desperately needed to;4
"This hotel has gone from bad to worse.  Where shall I begin, oh yes - I was approached by TWO security guards in the hotel lounge because... I fell asleep and was asked not to sleep in this area.  I'm a dumpy 40-something white guy with a laptop - not exactly threatening.  Now let's get onto the rest of just how awful this hotel is:  The breakfast buffet cost over fifty dollars for two people. And forget coffee, better not be in a hurry to go anywhere because table service... there was none the entire time I was seated; if you need something from the menu, better plan two hours for breakfast.  Same goes for lunch and dinner, super expensive and super not tasty - skip the hotel restaurant unless you've money to burn. Hotel bar restaurant cannot turn customers around in anything";1
I came in for a business Meeting running terribly late and this kind gentleman helped me with my car and led me straight to where I needed to go he gave me amazing customer service! I’ll definitely be coming back here ! Thank you Alejo for your professionalism!;5
Would be two-star review if not for staff. Plain and simple - this hotel is old and tired. And in desperate need of a renovation.   Elevators - old and rattling. Floors in the elevators I took were completely worn. Can’t speak for the other elevators.   I had a large corner room which I assume was an upgrade. The room was extremely large, which was nice. The downside is that there was nothing else to make the room seem upgraded. The outdated decor clearly showed its age, from the worn thermostat on the wall (which did not work), to the wall paper, and the worn caulking around the shower. There were odd areas of open space near the front door where they could have installed maybe a small kitchenette or decent coffee station and mini-fridge. Nope - just open dead space. Not sure;3
Kudos to Paulina at the reception desk.  She graciously booked us and upon learning it was my birthday, upgraded our room.  The room was clean and  comfortable. What a treat.  She also learned we were expecting our daughter's arrival after midnight.  She explained the shuttle process and directions. Unfortunately, our daughter was experiencing trouble finding the shuttle.  I inquired with the night attendant Elena who dismissively told me all arrivals are on the first floor. I asked my daughter to look for the shutlle on the first floor.  20 minutes later, my daughter said there was no shuttle even though I had seen three shuttles arrive with guests in that time.  Again, I asked Elena about the shuttle pick up location.  Without making eye contact with me, she rolled her eyes;3
"Beware do NOT stay here! This hotel was like a horribly ran down 80’s Motel. It was extremely busy at night with lots of sketchy ppl. I saw several women who “looked” & were dressed as prostitutes & a man with them who appeared to be a pimp. He was cussing and speaking aggressively to the three of them. Also the halls are VERY dark, no cameras! The rooms are medicine; warped and sagging mattresses. I changed rooms twice and both were horrible! The rooms are PITCH black &  have very little lighting; and my entrance light would no stay on. The room was old, musty, but the restroom was very clean.  The AC wouldn’t work; it was hot even after the air was on 67. My threshold was broken and you could literally see light under my door!  The lock was quite shabby and didn’t appear nor";1
We arrived exhausted and waited 25 minutes in a line to check in. The king bed room we booked was unavailable and the check in clerk said she would “upgrade” us to a room with 2 queens. Bathroom was dirty, fixtures above the mirror had gunk and dirt caked on.  No hotel info AT ALL in the room.  Concierge was called four times to ask where we could get pizza, no answer. Called main desk, put on hold and never got through.  Spoke to manager about the check in wait and he was dismissive, said we received a room upgrade. When I pointed out we received a 2 queen bed standard room because the king bed one we booked was apparently unavailable he said “have a good night” and hung up. We received $5 off the expensive $35 parking fee. Breakfast is extremely expensive, be aware of the;1
I booked a room for king size bed which was reserved 4 days ago was given to other people, staff was not very helpful. I call customer service which had no answer except telling me to go to the manager next day. It is disappointing at the way the handle situation and not honoring guest reservation despite booking it through their website directly.;1
Booked a night here as we had a long drive before flying back to the UK so wanted a relaxing evening before a long flight. Turned out to be as far from relaxing as possible! Minor issue to start with - no remote for the TV. Bit weird but sorted with a visit to reception. Next issue was the noise level. Now I appreciate it’s an airport hotel so was expecting some noise of planes but being on the 3rd floor and being able to hear the car rental people on the ground word for word gives you an idea of what the planes sounded like - bit like being in a tent at the end of a runway I imagine. Not sure if the windows were shot or the retro-fitted air conditioning but they were terrible. Lastly and worst of all a member of staff (I assume so as they had a key!) walked into our room around;1
We stayed at this hotel the night before our early 6:00 am flight.  Such a nice hotel and the staff was so kind, especially at the Sports Bar where we watched the Dallas Cowboy game and ate dinner on Sunday night.  The rooms are very big and comfortable.  The free shuttle bus to the airport in the morning is a plus, but they should have some sort of number system of who gets on first.  There were alot of people at 4 am catching the shuttle and the people that came at the last minute push their way up to get on the bus and the people who got there early in the morning were not able to get on the first ride.  So, I think they should hand out numbers and that is the order you get on the bus.  Overall, I would stay here again.;5
Stayed one comfortable night before an early flight the next morning. This property is standard fare the Marriott chain. The only complaint and it's minor is there was no microwave in the room and you had to share one located in a common area on the floor.;4
My family, Justin Heywood, Lelia Lee-Heywood, Anthony Rutkowski-Cesaire and I are here on vacation for two weeks and the staff Jazmin Hernandez, Monica Quinonez, Paulina Martinez are extremely professional and kind. A very special thanks to Juan Vasquez who goes above and beyond his normal duties to make sure guests are comfortable and welcome.Thank you all again for your attention and service.;5
As a Bonvoy Titanium Elite, there are some expectations within the Marriott/Bonvoy brand.  The Four Points Sheraton seemingly is 4 points out of 10.  The rooms leave a lot to be desired.  Received a package and they charged $3 as a handling fee. WTF?  I have never been charged a fee at any of the Marriott brands or SPG brands previously.  If this were a Four Seasons, I could understand, but even Four Seasons does not charge. Unfortunately, I am day 1 into a 7 day stay here.  May move across the street to a Marriott.  So disappointing for a Bonvoy branded hotel.  Will not stay here again.  I am at a workshop for business being held in this awful hotel.  If future workshops by the company will be held here, I will stay at the Marriott across the street or the Residence Inn a half;2
The hotel is very close to LAX which is great. When we arrived, we pulled up and used valet parking. Hotel staff unloaded our luggage an took it to our room. Check in was easy and paid for valet during check in. The hotel lobby is nice. The room is fine for staying overnight before or after flight. The room is showing some age. The pleather chair for the desk was worn and the pleather was cracking everywhere. The rest of the room was fine and somewhat updated. The bathroom is showing signs of age. Rooms are not large or small, typical hotel room size.;3
Let’s face it...hotels at airports are rarely the best places in any city. That said, the Four Points at LAX maybe one of the better hotels in the airport group. First...It’s gigantic with 3 major buildings all connected with a common lobby, pool, and restaurants. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  My room was clean with a nice view of the nice pool. While that’s nice, the real advantage of this hotel is it’s located adjacent to LAX and Hertz.   Would I want to spend a week there...probably not. But for a few nights...it’s a great little place.;4
A 100 point shout out to Victor Valencia (Hotel Valet) for going out of his way to help me. Unusual in so many ways, Victor demonstrated an acute sense of awareness (he noticed and acted before I could state my need) making my visit very memorable. I wish those employed in the service industry could approach their jobs with the sense of dignity, pride in his job and commitment demonstrated by Mr Valencia, Kudos to the hotel's management for hiring and inspiring this type of work ethic.;5
We stayed for 4 days (that we booked on 2 separate reservations), had 3 different rooms, none of them were what we paid for. We paid for a room with 1 king bed, had 3 rooms with 2 beds.. All of them were really unconfortable at the point we almost didn’t sleep. 1st one, the AC was not working, so they moved us, 2nd one window was broken so we had all the exterior noise, they didn’t want to move us… After multiple complain and 2 sleepless night they gave us another room. They gave us the keys the morning and certified that the room was booked for us. We went out during the day and came back at 11pm to find out that they gave our room to another customer because we didn't showed ourselves on the afternoon. We’ve received no email, no text or calls ! We didn’t know that there were;1
I didn't stay here, but parked here for a flight. It was a very good experience. The shuttle was on time and Victor was communicative. I even had to extend my stay for a day and it was no problem. We communicated via email and Victor took care to make sure my car was safe. Thanks again. Will park and stay here again in the future.;5
Went to dinner in their restaurant/bar Brewsters.  They sat us adjacent to where the servers hung out and the cash registers.  They were loud carrying on and had no respect for us sitting only a few feet away. Very annoying and disruptive. Food just okay.  Seems run down and worn. Avoid;2
Although not all our rooms were ready, this was quickly rectified. Some modernisation has gone on downstairs in the lobby and pool are in particular. Rooms were clean but still need more work to match the feel mood downstairs. Okay for short stay or as a stop over;3
Room was run down (furniture was shabby and beat up) and the conference facilities were small and uncomfortable.  Food options were minimal. Very close to the airport. Not much more to say, don’t know why I have to keep typing...;3
After arriving late due to a medical emergency on our flight we were told that there was no room booked and non available. We showed the clerk the booking which included type of room, reference no and date booked.  She still told us that nothing was available and was there anyone we could call. After calling the UK and speaking to our rep, who told us it was definitely booked and had the ref no on hand. He spoke to clerk who again said there was no room booked. While all this was going on, when our rep asked to speak to the manager she promptly handed the phone to the guy stood next to her who had been there all the time, never made himself known to us and made no attempt to help, before wandering off and leaving our rep hanging on our mobile phone. After what seemed an age he;1
We arrived after 10pm due to travel issues... very tired from flight to be greeted by a surly young lady on reception who insisted there was no booking for me. Tried to get me to leave and go to another hotel.   I had to contact agent in UK who spoke with her at length confirming my prepaid booking. The hotel manager stood next to her during the entire discussion and when needed he had to do something else. Eventually they 'found' a booking not the room I had paid for. No apology for their error.  Managed to get meal in restaurant again rude and surly staff with customers. First time I have refused to give a tip.;1
WOW WHAT A GREAT SERVICE...I have been traveling around the world to different places. I've been to New York, Florida, and other impressive places in the United States. I dont really take time to do reviews but this time, I feel that it is important to note my experience at this Hotel. On this day, I rented a car and arrived to the hotel to stay over the weekend for a meeting. When i arrived to the parking lot I was greeted by a really helpful person in the front by the name of Victor Valencia. He grabbed my car and parked it. I did this 3 times thought the week and each time it was like we got to know each other even more. I had other parking attendants that assisted me but this one stood out to me. I would like to extend my thanks to the team for having such a helpful;5
The stay itself was pleasant, however I see myself forced to only give one star as I’m extremely dissatisfied with the customer service. From what I’ve experienced and read in some other reviews, I have the feeling that they try to scam people that don’t pay close attention to what happens with their credit card.  This was my encounter (which is still open and without any satisfying solution):  1. We had a pre-payed room. They still locked the costs for a full room on my card for a week (on top of the deposit!) until I asked to finally release the money. This took 2 phone calls.  2. We stayed for one night which would have cost 35$ for parking. They charged me double. After problem 1 was finally solved they promised to rescue the parking fee to 25$. That’s been over 3 weeks now.;1
Quite a depressing looking hotel, expensive for what you get, nothing is included, eg wifi, mediocre service, boring interior, there is no reason why for all their profit, they could not update and create a more pleasant hotel.;3
Staff was very efficient and friendly, check-in was fast.  The airport shuttle runs often and both drivers that we had were helpful.  Our room was clean and comfortable, not a great view but we don't really expect that at the airport....  Plenty of places to eat that are easy to walk to (under 2 miles).  We would stay here again.;3
I’ve never written a review on TripAdvisor, but I just received such great customer service from Victor Valencia at Four Points Sheraton LAX that I felt compelled to.  My son booked long-term LAX parking at Four Points through a third-party website.  He was parked there for almost a month, and had prepaid a discounted rate.  However, somehow when picking up his car, he spaced and forgot that he had prepaid and allowed the hotel to charge him over $1,000 for the parking.  I almost had a heart attack and called the hotel.  The hotel quickly connected me with Victor.  He calmed me down and assured me that if I emailed him the website receipt, he would immediately reverse the $1,000 charge.  In no more than 5 minutes I received a phone call back from Victor, as well as an email;5
Front desk “platinum line” would rather stare at you waiting in line, and attend to aviation that arrives well after you, rather than doing what’s right (which is attending to customers who are actually physically present and waiting to be checked in). Its the little things that add up.;3
We stayed here for two nights before flying on to Miami.  It suited us but is very much designed for a person using LA as a hub to fly somewhere else.  Not really a tourist hotel due to location.  It is an older style, very small rooms.  Our booking didn't offer breakfast. There is a bus stop very close which we used to catch bus to Santa Monica.;3
Wow!!!! . great valet young lady!!!! Very sweet!!! Maria has made my day since the day I arrived. Always leaving with a smile. Everyone here treats me very well. I’m definitely coming back next time.😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊;5
Nice Hotel close to the airport. Check in after 9pm and greeted by a nice front desk lady. Parking is expensive and the parking spot is very very narrow. Good for a night stay but t not for long stays.;4
I reserved 3 rooms for my family before an early flight to Maui the next day. Walked in to the hotel and noticed it was hot, as the doors were open, we didn't think too much of it. When we got to our rooms, all different floors and no where near each other, we found our rooms were even hotter. ALL 3 OF THEM. Call front desk numerous times, and no one came up. It was 78% at 9pm at night! We are top tier with Marriott, now Bonvoy, and we still haven't recieved any information or compensation even though I've call many time. Totally disgusted.;1
This is a classic around LAX.  Had a good day rate (9 to 5) through a search engine.  The hotel has a small friendly front desk, and nice lobby facing a nice pool.  My room was in 2nd floor and although the view was boring, the room was very comfortable and good for a rest and a hot shower between two long flights.   Maybe one thing that I miss from other areas nearby LAX is the lack of restaurants or supermarkets. The closest super is around 1 mile walking along the Sepulveda Blvd.   Maybe not a problem if you have a car, not the case If you have to walk under the sun and maybe with bulky items.   Didn't try hotel cafeteria or restaurant.;4
"Stayed at this hotel twice for business. Check-in can be rather busy around 8-9 PM with guests and airline crew members arriving from their flights. After 9 PM, it starts to quiet down. Aside from that, the hotel is well maintained. Rooms are a bit dated and are showing their age. Hoping for a remodeling or refresh soon. Bed is comfortable enough and in the two times I've stayed; the shower pressure has been very strong and has good temperature consistency. Buffet is decent enough although the hotel does cater to Chinese travelers by offering congee (rice soup), and was good enough though not at the same standards as Chinatown or Monterey Park. The biggest reason why I stayed at this hotel was to utilize the airport shuttle. The shuttle seems to depart every 30 minutes. The only";4
Stayed here for a friends trip to go to Disneyland and University Studios and the place was very welcoming! The location is key! Very friendly staff and shuttle bus is provided to get around which I thought is very accommodating.;5
After 15 years of coming to the same hotel, 5 times a year - and surprise charges coming up more and more - it’s finally time to say good bye and make a change. Find out exactly how much and what you are paying for! Airport Shuttle service is terrible (infrequent), rooms are not very clean and smelly. Room next door loud with two dogs!!!!;2
We are in Los Angeles for a few days before a Cruise staying at the four points Sheraton. Seems to be a very nice clean and hospitality filled Hotel. Our room is clean. And quiet. Pool looks inviting we will hang out there later. We are renting a car from them tomorrow in the hotel so we can go explore;5
I stayed there with partner for 5 days . The worst hotel I’ve never seen in my life . It’s a motel by Sheraton . We checked in with a very rude agent st the front desk . when we got to the room the tv was not working they sent an engineer so instead of resting and enjoying our vacation we were waiting for the engineer to fix the tv because they didn’t want to give another room. We were on the sixth floor where the ice machine is broken and there was an AC at the hallway so loud we couldn’t sleep then the ac inside the room is so noisy as well. The cleaning could be improved , the room looks so old and they offer coffee and creamers  in the room that are expired. Not worth the money at all plus they charge 35$ plus tax for the parking while they charge others for 20$ for parking;1
Firts time staying at this property. The check in too longer than expected as they had flight crew checking in which did not sit well with me since I was in the Elite line as being a Titanium Elite  expected to be taken before them but they dealt with them first.   The room was comfortable and overlooked the pool area. I had a suite which was nice. Large with a sofa and chair in a living room area. They have a restaurant in the lobby. Good food but the service could be improved.  They have a shults to and from the airport which is a short drive. I would stay here again.;4
Stayed with family for 3 nights Plus: Clean, friendly staff, pool Negative: Noisy Outdated, for the price you pay, really bad Expensive and bad breakfast option - this is for the buffet Parking is not free of charge;2
Had an opportunity to stay at this hotel and the service was amazing, my 10 year old son who travels with me quite often said it was the best hotel hes ever stayed at.   The only downside I can say is that getting to the hotel when there's a lot of traffic going into the airport can make it difficult.   The hot tub is a little small seats 4 people maybe...  But the pool is heated which is nice.  All in all it was a nice stay and I would recommend this hotel.;5
We checked in using the Bonvoy app and by the time we arrived at 1030am our room was ready. Free bottles of water and very friendly staff. Suggest using valet since self parking is a hike. It’s only $4 more per day and pretty fast. Great for a quick in and out to the airport. My new favorite LAX hotel.;5
Pro: The staff was very kind and professional. Had a few parking ticket issues and I accidentally demagnetized my room key and they were more than accommodating. The room and bathroom were very clean . Bed was oddly comfortable too me.  There’s a nice restaurant and bar downstairs.   Con: The hotel rooms could use a few upgrades. Carpets seemed old and a little outdated. The bathroom in my Delux King Suite(which the wonderful staff upgraded me to) was super small and oddly placed. I don’t think they have air conditioning..There’s a thermostat that you can control and you get coldish air . It’s more of a fan ...But the good thing is your window partially opens so you can get fresh air and a breeze. Parking is $35 a night!!!! Ouch! Also the lot isn’t all that big. The elevators;3
Hello,  Just wanted to say I stayed the night at your hotel and the valet man Alejo was wonderful! He was very nice and helpful to My friend and I. So thank you for helping us and being kind Alejo! Made our stay very pleasant.;5
Above and beyond Bonvoy/Marriott plummeting in an upper scale brand such as Hilton/Embassy Suites/Hilton Garden, this hotel pure garbage.  A tired worn down motel type property full of sketchy people who are high on pot.  All electrical fixtures were black with grime.  AC did not function at all.    Shuttle busses to/from airport ran very In-frequently.  Avoid this place.;1
Basics were available and okay. Check in took very long after a 14 hours flight and a wish for a bed we had to wait another 20 minutes till we got our room. Was okay so far, two beds and a bathroom, nothing special. But the shower was the problem. Tap and instruments were very lose in the wall, we feared to tear them out when using them. All in all the hotel was very old fashioned, there were no windows to the outside but just to the corridor. Okay for a one night stay with airport shuttle but for a longer time in LA I wouldn’t recommend it.;3
I landed in LAX relatively early (about 10-11 AM.) I set my Marriott Bonvoy app's check-in time at 12 noon, and ran out to catch the shuttle, which did not leave without me. The shuttle driver would stop at the terminals and reassure guests that another shuttle would be coming for them (a nice touch compared to other shuttle drivers, who will just drive off or leave abruptly.)  I walked into the lobby and was checked in by Paulina M., who graciously received me and provided exceptional service, with an early check-in on the 6th floor to boot. Check-in times are normally around 3 or 4, so I was grateful that I didn't have to wait in the lobby for my room after a 12-hour flight.  The room itself is clean and comfortable. I was able to order Uber Eats and get some sleep.  Check-out;5
I had a great experience today. Maria, Alejo and Victor were very friendly and gave excellent service at the valet parking area. Again, great job!! Good employees are the key to success. These people are ideal associates.  Antoine V Roberson;5
Friendly reception!  We were able to have late checkout till 6pm (staggered pricing - for 6pm it was 75 US$), and it had everything we needed!  I didn’t leave the room except to have dinner downstairs in the bar/restaurant.   The bed was sooooo comfy!  I had the greatest sleep!   Very generous with the aircon - it was blasting all night, which I love!    The bathroom is small but it was serviceable and clean.  The airport shuttle was free and was easy to find and use.   I think it’s a great choice - especially to relax between flights!;4
The check in staff never be welcoming, with no smiles, no talk, looks lazy to process check in, even never explain about the room amd facilities. verY disappointed since the hotel is still the starwood and marriott group. The room is old and not really comfortable, no view from the window, poor amenities.;1
"We stayed in four points by sheraton in May not a pleasant stay, the room that was assigned to us had people sleeping already in it, ""they up graded our room"" didn't look any different then the previous one. After we return from our cruise my son was not feeling well and vomit, they wouldn't come and clean the room, so we had to sleep with the smell all night long, very upsetting.";2
Recently my wife and I stayed one night at this hotel prior to our trip to Chicago the following day. They now have their own shuttle buses to the airport and run frequently. Paid parking is available on premises including handicap. We had an early dinner in the bar.  Food was good as well as the service. There are other dining options but we had an early am flight the next day. This hotel is now part of the Marriott/Sheraton merger and as such I used Frequent Traveler points for our stay. Hotel personnel were very pleasant and accommodating.;4
Well, I choose this hotel for the simple reason that it was the cheapest, most decent looking hotel in LA. I got exactly what I paid for. It’s decent. Paying about $160/nt + $35 parking. Pro’s : Hotel is fairly clean, location to airport and freeways and employee service is good. Con’s: The hotel is outdated, bath tub overflows when taking a shower and elevators take a really long time ( only 1/3 seem to be working). None of these cons are soo bad that it makes me want to spend about $50-100 more per night plus $50 for parking for the next better hotel. This place does the job, able to sleep comfortably at night and go out and be a tourist all day!;3
good hotel to stay...prices are half from down town properties..free shuttle to airport  it was a better idea to stay here and explore down town....breakfast is good with over   all selection..check in is very smooth....;4
I now know why there was a deal on this hotel. This is was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Be prepared to wait everywhere in this building. There is valet parking available which we waited in line for when I finally got to the front of the line, rude nasty guy working the valet just hands me a 15 minuet ticket for valet, I explained I wanted to park over night “well then you have to go do it yourself” was the explanation I got told. It’s also 35$ dollars to park there no matter if you are a guest at the hotel or someone off the street. Fantastic. There was a motorcycle convention going on when we stayed, 100+ people, so tons of bikes. We had to wait in line to check in to the hotel for over 45 minuets and the line just kept getting longer and longer as we waited to check;1
My review actually surprises me, as I had stayed in this hotel twice previously this year and my experiences had been good. However, on this occasion had a room in the West Wing for the first time - it was awful. Who wants a window opening on to the corridor. We were 3 adults and 2 small children. They provided 'one' bottle of water, and one cup for coffee. The aircon did not work. I mentioned this at reception before going out for dinner. When we returned, some more bottled water had been provided but still one coffee cup and the aircon still did not work. However, it was late and we were all tired and did not relish the idea of someone trying to fix the aircon while we were trying to get children to sleep. I never had a bad experience with Starwood before the Marriott;2
Sorry this is so long in being posted and so long a post. This hotel is very much in need of refurbishing, if not a thorough cleaning. I checked in on Apr 22, for one night and was given a card at reception that I earned a room upgrade. If my room was an upgrade I can't imagine what other rooms are like. In addition when I phoned reception to inquire about restaurants and shops nearby instead of connecting me to the concierge she informed me that there was only 1 place, In & Out Burger, to eat within walking distance, this woman must not have been able to walk but a very short distance.  There were a number of issues with my room, some photos below, so I went to speak to a manager. I spoke to Mr. Saleeb the evening mgr who said he would follow up with the hotel manager. At the;3
Every single person that we’ve talked to has been friendly and helpful, room was awesome, AC was cold! Pool was fun family activity. Not a lot of places in walking distance, but you can uber easily. Also, they have a free shuttle to and from the airport.  I would definitely stay here again.;5
This hotel is AWFUL and I can’t believe it’s a Marriot property. I’d rather stay at in my car. The rooms are very dark. No lighting other than 2 small dim lamps and no natural light since the window looks out into the buildings hallway. It’s an old building and old hotel. SUPER YUCK! I couldn’t stay and changed my reservation.;1
The hotel location is really near the airport but far from any establishment. It is also lovely to walk in the evening. The room is really clean and neat, comfy. You can relax after a long travel. There were infused water near the elevators.;4
Good idea to stay close to the LAX airport as the traffic is crazy to get to the airport to take a flight. The room was clean, quiet and got a good night's sleep before travel the next day. Parking the car is $32, so we dropped off our car the night before and used the shuttle service the next morning to the airport, took about 5 to 7 minutes. All the restaurants nearby close by 10 p.m. but the restaurant in the hotel has decent food with reasonable prices. Check-in staff very polite. Printed out our booking to check in.;4
Booked a king room got two small doubles in a small room like a ninties motel room. Only window faced the enclosed walkway. Pretty horrible. Bed was clean which was good. Elevators incredibly slow and not enough for size of hotel;2
Had a flight cancelled and was put up here over night on the house. Not too shabby to be totally honest. Swimming pool is warmed to a good temperature, with plenty of sun loungers and clean towels. Room. Everything was spotless and lots of clean towels with a super comfy bed. Food in restaurant is good with very attentive staff, prices are crazy. $10 for 2 tiny glasses of apple juice!!  Shuttles from airport are scarce and jammed when in them so be prepared 🤬;3
The hotel is fine for one, two days stay.  Cons: We came late at night, with kids and the check in lasted more than an hour. We were so tired and was dreaming about the rest.  Pros: the good thing is that you can open the window in the room and get fresh air.;3
Stayed 1 night before flight from LAX to Paris. Good location for hire car drop off at Avis, approx 10m walk. Hotel looks good from outside and in the foyer too, however it quickly appears dated one you get in the elevator and go to your room. I was staying on the 4th floor in a room overlooking the main entrance and Airport Blvd. whilst the room is big, the furniture is dated from the 90s, and the windows have no double glazing for noise reduction. In fact a price of foam between the windows was all it had!! Therefore traffic noise was a real problem for me. One other room point, the bathroom was very small. On a plus point, staff were helpful, bed comfy and breakfast was ok for price. Wouldn’t recommend the hotel as it does need a update;3
My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a few days in May. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly and attentive. The bed is comfortable and the room is and adequate size. This hotel offers a shuttle service and it is in close proximity to the airport. They have two restaurants downstairs that provides breakfast, lunch and dinners. The breakfast does not come with the cost of the rooms.  The food is good and they offer a wide variety of beers for you beer lovers. In addition, if you forget something in your travels, they have a boutique on the first floor. This hotel does not offer room service.;4
It was a miracle meeting Maria at Valet. My truck battery had died and I didn’t know what to do till she immediately ran to her car and brought jump start cables. She is so Nice and treated me like family! I’m definitely coming back at this hotel. My stay was AWSOME!;5
We stayed here one night after a long flight into LAX from Dublin Ireland.  The beds were comfortable enough, which is what counts, I guess.  This is an older hotel that is barely keeping up on maintenance.  Nothing particularly wrong with this hotel, but with this brand name and the cost, I would have expected much better.  They do have a shuttle that gets you to and from the airport.  There really is nothing in the way of food within reasonable walking distance, except maybe Jersey Mike’s and a pizza joint.  Burgers in the bar are $16 and take forever to come out.;4
We stayed here for a night when stopping over from Vegas as we had a early morning flight.   They offer a shuttle service to and from the airport which is great and very quick.   The hotel itself is average, nothing spectacular. But the staff are very friendly and helpful. And it's great if your looking for a place to stay near the airport and only in LA for a few hours.   The rooms are very clean and generally so is the hotel.;5
My husband had this to say about his stay: I had a quick turn around trip to attend a good friend's memorial service so wanted to be within walking distance to Budget Car Rental which was across the street. I had flown in from Geneva, Switzerland the evening before the service so that I could get a good night's sleep before driving to San Clemente the next day. I needed to have Wifi in order to keep up with my work emails, so appreciated that the Wifi was free. The day of the memorial service I walked over to Budget, picked up the car and drove to San Clemente. I returned the car by 6:00 pm that evening and got a good night's sleep before heading back to Geneva the next day. The only thing that didn't work properly was the TV. Other than that, I appreciated  the location of the;4
The valet at this hotel was exceptional! I had the pleasure of speaking with Patty and she was such a delight to meet!! Very personable, friendly, and just a delight to interact with. I would totally recommend this hotel because of my experience with Patty!;5
I travel a lot for work and stay in a lot of different hotels. For this brand, the location and the cost, I was very surprised and disappointed that they didn't have a refrigerator or microwave in the room. Motel 6 has a microwave and refrigerator in their rooms! Not only that they've been working on repairing a couple of the elevators for over a year now. We have an annual event at this property and last year the elevator was being repaired leaving only ONE elevator working on one side of this huge hotel, so you're waiting 5-10 minutes for an elevator to arrive. And we just had the event again and the elevators still aren't repaired so it was again a waiting game for an elevator on that same side. Not cool. With all the money they're saving not having microwaves and;3
Alejo made me want to stay at 4 points in the future. We came for a conference and stayed at another hotel. Each time we came over to 4 points we we're greeted with a smile and genuine kindness. Thinking of next time in the area to stay at 4 points  ty alejo for making a memorable experience;5
Hotel was fine in every way.  But your front desk clerk made us feel like home.  Warm greeting.  Told us where to eat, about room.  Even phoned to be sure we were okay and our needs met.  We both have special needs and were moved and delighted by the extra care Joannaly provided us.  Your hotel should be proud to have someone like her.;5
We stayed overnight and left our car here for a short trip of 6 days. . Had a very early flight out of LAX so we were looking for a place to leave our car.  In addition to being a clean , comfortable place to overnight, they have a plan for Park & Fly where we could stay & leave our auto for $241. This was cheaper and more convenient than an airport hotel plus airport parking lots. Very nice staff, great room. Shuttle to the airport. Very satisfied.;4
Great hotel and great location... a little outdated but it could have just been the color of the carpet. Housekeeping is impeccable and the room was perfect and clean. Staff is amazing and friendly and helpful. Many choices for food... we ordered food at the bar and it was great... we picked up things for the kids at the counter which they had salads, cold items, muffins, juices... everything you could use. Teens loved it!;5
We arrived here Saturday night Sunday morning 2am after a long flight from the Dominican Republic to be told their computer system was down and so they did not know what rooms were available. This was a total lie!! A few minutes later they said they were sorry but they had oversold the hotel and had no rooms available, but in a few days we would get a refund of our money, No offer of any other was given to us. We had parked our car here for a week and so we ended up driving 80 miles to my sons home at 2am. I will never stay at a Sheraton property again, Not even a real we are sorry.;1
Stayed here while taking family to Manhattan, Redondo, and Hermosa Beach. Good location for getting to the beaches without much traffic or difficulty, so great location at a good value. Nice restaurant and bar at the hotel. Can walk a bit to get breakfast at Denny's if you don't want to overpay for a decent breakfast.;4
Very good option right in front of the airport.  Very clean, very comfortable beds, it is a bit noisy but not unbearable.  Check in and out very fast.  Friendly and helpful staff and they have shuttle to the airport.  I do not give him five stars for the restaurant.;4
I’d like this hotel because of its local proximity to the LAX Airport. The shuttle bus service to and from airport was great and the drivers were very funny and friendly. The hotel itself is quite decent, and they have their own car rental towards the end of the parking lot exit with another car rental facility. Across the street it is Budget Car Rental so it’s very convenient. The room itself is quite clean. The only item I don’t quite like is the light colour tone. It’s too white and not yellowish warmth so I’d kind of feel that hurt my eyes. Other than that, the interior is quite good. Staff members are very friendly.;4
Good location for an airport transfer and a nice outside pool. The rooms were incredibly basic and the bathroom very dated. The rooms could be better cleaned and the lifts struggle to maintain the demands of a large hotel. The staff we encountered were helpful and pleasant but we got the impressive priority is always given to airline crew that use this hotel.;3
Overnight stay here between flights. Did not start well asn had to endure the hotel van driver engaging in road rage during the trip to the hotel with him  leaning out the window with his finger in the air aiming at another driver while yelling obscenities in the most definitely not church like phrases. Registration area is somewhat underwhelming though efficient and room on first impression was spacious and clean however in the bathroom he provided soap was actually an open pack with an already sued bar contains someones hair - soap dispenser in the shower did however suffice. Down stairs small bar was nice and good food and drink. Nights sleep was quiet and van ride back to the airport could not have been more different than the ride to hotel the night before had been.;3
very close to the airport, spacious room, friendly stuff. We only stayed one night. I would booking it again.The outside pool area also looks nice. We also walked a bit around and found a nice breakfast place on the next corner.;4
We have stayed at this hotel many times and the room are nice, the staff is friendly, the bar can be fun, the shuttle to the terminals run well.  What we don't like is Marriott Bonvoy changing our benefits as Gold Members in 2019.  Before when we would check in we would receive two free drinks in the bar.  Of course we have another drink and then dinner.  Now with the new Marriott Bonvoy Gold Member benefits we received nothing, not even a cup of coffee.  Sorry Four Points, there is always Hilton & Hyatt that treats their Gold Members well.;3
I stayed 4 days at this hotel and everyone was very nice. The valet was superb! Maria treated me like family and I would definitely stay again. The room was very clean. Everything was very very nice.............................................................................;4
Good service, nice room They provided all what i need, i was so enjoy staying at four point los angeles because i can sleep well, it was so quiet, near for airport, i can be ontime to go to airport and also there is a shuttle bus to go to airport.;4
I would like to share we stayed at Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport and it was excellent. In particular staffmayra was excellent with providing optimal customer service. the foof was delicious, enviornment cool, hip, relaxing and enjoyable. Pool, room and overall hotel excellent condition and location. Recommend you falling up in her b/c worth it.;5
Thank you for your hospitality, Fourpoints ! We were warmly welcomed by Joannaly at the front desk. She was so kind to us and very thorough with her check-in. Thanks for the comp upgrade ! You truly have a great employee in her. Everyone was very friendly. Diosdado helped with luggage and he was so nice and careful with our belongings. Very professional and sweet man. Thanks again ! Seamless stay !;5
1.) Some of my belongings were stolen by housekeeping. I called and went back to the hotel to retrieve them just to wait an hour plus with zero answers.  2.) My friend prepaid for our room online. I got to the hotel before her, so I was told by the front desk that they needed a credit card to check in, so I gave them my card. And was told that when the other guest (my friend) arrived the card could be switched and charged to the person who booked the room. The cards were allegedly switched over but BOTH of our cards were charged instead of 1. This issue has yet to be resolved. I’m just getting the “run around”. We have proof from both of our bank statements. This truly has been an awful and stressful experience for the both of us, especially because they’re telling her they;1
Prior to checking in I emailed the hotel to arrange the shuttle to collect us from the airport, however I had no response and had to get an Uber $13, which was no issue but I thought is was poor service from the hotel not to respond to my email. Check in was quick and easy with a friendly informative lady.  There is no room service which surprised me for the size of the hotel. We ate in the Brewsters Beererie, good food large portions, but the AC made it very cold in there.  Service was normal.  We stayed in a Standard room in the tower and like many other comments it's dated, Half size bath, dated furniture, there was a bug on the bed, however the beds were comfortable and the shower worked well and facilities were ample.  Wifi is good all over the hotel, I had three devises;3
What an unusual place. Our room was on the fourth floor. We exited the elevator and went through a door and were suddenly on a “sidewalk “ with the pool on our right ( below) and rooms on our left with large windows facing on the enclosed ”sidewalk “.   The room was clean and updated and functional.  No breakfast included ($21 buffet or $19 continental or menu). Later saw the cooler next to registration with individual takeaway items.   Beware: a man on our shuttle from lax said he waited 45 minutes for shuttle. He checked in ahead of us and was back to the desk before we left. He reported that he scared the heck out of the person who was in his assigned room!  Shuttle was quick and easy. Less than 10 minutes door to door.;3
I highly recommend this nice hotel.  I was impressed with the staff especially the Valet Sergio.  It is so important to have Valet that are personable and outgoing as well as professional.  Sergio greeted me with a big smile.  Although I was stressed out from my trip to LA.  His smile truly was genuine  and encouraging.  I would not hesitate to return. It felt like home.   I am looking forward to return on my next trip to LA.;5
It was a nice location near the airport. The shuttle service was very quick and prompt getting us to and from the hotel. The hotel check-in was quick and very professional by the young lady. However they didn’t look at my profile being a Marriott titanium rewards member. They stuck us next to the elevator. I had to ask to be moved to another room. Once we got to the room the air conditioning was not working. We left and went to dinner, when we returned the AC still wasn’t working. We had to call engineering to come and fix the situation. If you have other options take them!;3
Stayed here after my Uber dropped me off at the Sheraton Hotel about 1/3 mile away.  Don’t get confused between the two hotel properties similarly carrying the name Sheraton.  Clean and basic.  Front desk staffing minimal and nobody around at checkout.  Simply left my key.  Good airport shuttle.;3
Older, Decent Airport Hotel. You can tell this place is very old but has been renovated. The renovation is sub-par at best but the beds are comfortable. Staff was very friendly. However I just don't know if I would pick this location again.;3
We had booked two rooms in order to drop off my daughter who was flying out of LAX. We traveled to the hotel and reached around 9pm. Our rooms were stuffy and given the price we didn't even have a refrigerator in the room. There are no reasonably priced eating places nearby, so unless you bring your own food you will be forced to eat in the hotel restaurants. Then to top it all we got locked out of our room when the security latch closed on its own, and then had to call the security to open up the room. They took a while to get to our room and open it. The highlight was the shuttle service to and from LAX. That was smooth and convenient. I am not planning to go back.;2
The hotel may be a bit dated but well maintained. Has everything you need for a great stay. The staff is amazing and makes sure all your needs are met. Also, very clean. I highly recommend staying here due to their great team of employees.;5
"Lobby was nice, bright, clean and check in fast  now...walk to room was creepy. I got off the elevator and was transported to a crappy 70s/80s hotel/motel. Dark, dingy, and the rooms were internal...as in they do not have windows to the outside, just into he hallway.  After getting into my room and locking up/stacking furniture against the door....the room itself was nice. I was only there for 1 night for a long layover.   clean and contemporary room.   woken up at like 1am to a guy gabbering away on his cellphone AT my ""window"".   just a little creepy. I don't wanna tell him to quiet down, bc he is literally at my door.   Overall id stay again for a cheap flight, but not if I WAS SOLO AGAIN";3
"I stayed only one night to prepare for a next-day flight.  I would have been happy with much less than the Sheraton provided.  Fair disclosure:  some of the outer corridors looked a bit down-at-the-heels; some sprucing up is in order (paint and carpet at the minimum).  But my room was clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated.    There was a restaurant (limited menu) in the lobby and a very nice seating space in the lobby where I read for a time the next morning, before going to the airport. Staff was helpful and airport shuttle ran regularly.  Thank you!";5
An ok visit for one night, roomed with a friend.  Kind of the ugly stepsister of the Marriott and Sheraton properties at LAX. But surely passable for one night.    The event staff was great for the event we had on site. Very accommodating and responsive and just darn nice on site day of.     I have stayed there on and off over the years especially when a conference i worked on was there. It still attracts quite the mixture of people just jetlagging or leaving, a slew of foreigners who love the lower prices, some flight crews and more.  An odd juxtaposed mix for sure.     Some odd decorating now in the lobby with some big metal chairs that are hung from the ceiling and seat 1 person.  Not sure what they are going for with this but it wasn't working for me.    Not sure I can;3
Walking through the doors first appearance looks amazing. Elena from front desk was super helpful. The beds were actually my favorite. I'm a picky person when it comes to pillows A+ for that. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that there wasn't a way to connect my Netflix account to the TV only by installing an app was I able to connect my phone but with the same options as the TV amenities so my friends and I just used our phones till we all fell asleep. I was the first one to wake up around 6:00am and everyone was still asleep so I showered thinking I would start slowly waking everyone but with no success I left downstairs and wanted to surprise our friend who was leaving back to the Philippines and wanted to buy flowers and luckily I found Roberto from transportation;4
As we were looking for accommodation near the airport, it was a perfect choice.           We stayed here for 2 nights, everything was fine. Room with clean, comfortable beds. Very delicious candies at the receptionist :-);5
I bring my own towels when I travel. I don't bring white ones thats for sure. My towel was stolen/ taken my accident? whatever the case may be, it was not in my room after i returned from being out. I reported it to the MOD and left my info but no call back after I was reassured I would be notified. I called twice and left messages but still no response. I know its only towels, but its the principal of the matter.;2
We were recommended this hotel by work colleagues as a hotel close to the airport. The free bus collects and drops you at the hotel which is a five minute drive. Most of the car rentals are across the road from the hotel.  The hotel itself looks a little tired but for one night you can put up with it. Food in the bar is average but expensive for what it is but it’s a captive audience at the airport location.   Staff are friendly which helps.   Would I stay there again?? Probably not as I would look to try somewhere else.;4
"Stayed a couple of nights at the Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles Airport to see the sights of Los Angeles while on route to south of the border. Was satisfied with this property. Room was clean and staff were helpful. My main criticism would be that the elevators and corridors reeked of pot smoke. Smells like they were having a weed convention at the hotel. Not good, because not everyone smokes weed. The hotel should do more to respect the non-smokers on property.    And the other thing; the price of the onsite parking. At $32 I found this pricey, and it caught me by surprise as I rented a car to visit Hollywood boulevard and popular LA sites.";4
"I stayed in Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport end of January 2019 for a stop-over and it was a very good decision. The room they gave me was really big (I could have danced a waltz between the Bed and the work desk if my partner would have joined me). ;-) The staff was very friendly and the shuttle buses on both ways (from and to LAX airport) free of charge. If you have an stopover and looking for a good hotel with good quality - I'd pick this one.";4
If you want a good feeling about your stay, this is not the spot for you and your family. If you are on a budget and by yourself for one night, you might be able to bare this place. Overall feels like a cheap motel and not worth it if your expectation is a decent hotel vibe. Everything seems worm down and feels dirty. Nothing more to say other than I wont be coming back here unless I am broke and all other decent hotels are booked up and I have absolutely no choice.;1
I arrived at the hotel from a late evening flight and had to wait for the hotel staff to finish talking and attend to the guests trying to check in.  When I finally got my room key, I went to the lifts - two of the three were out of service - and went up to my room only to find it hadn't been cleaned and that the curtain was hanging off the window.  I went downstairs and showed the person at the desk the photos and asked for another room.  Although I got another room, which was marginally better and at least clean, the staff member didn't seems that concerned that I had been checked in to a room that wasn't clean. The room I stayed in had no sound proofing and you could hear planes taking off.  Bed was comfortable enough though.  I was happy to get out of there the next morning.;1
"Joke of a hotel. In my opinion, they have one,  just one job. To get me to and from the airport. That's it nothing else and by George does the Four Points by Sheraton suck at it. Had to take Uber because their ""shuttle"" is nowhere to be found.";1
The overall experience was not good. One bar restaurant with terrible food. Ordered a burger with an egg on top for $2.00 and took it back to my room only to realize there was no egg and it was awful. Went to get ice and the machine was busted. The shower was broken and it sprayed up on the ceiling. And the worse part was I was awakened at 1:30 by the neighbors talking. Walls are like paper. I will not go back.;1
It's useful if you rented a car with Budget because you have to drop it off in front of the hotel. BUT, if you're not the case, skip this hotel. The rooms are old, crappy, smell horrible and they're barely clean. It's confusing to find the front desk and the attention doesn't make it any better.;1
Hotel is a little bit outdated and needs renovations.   Check in went smooth with very friendly, smiley and helpful Paulina (Polish first name of Mexican descent born American).   Room was ok with basics and cheap finish. Air-conditioning on the floor at the window was huge and took a big part of a room space. Window didn't see window cleaner for very long time, also you need to use force to open it. I did love the shower tough - very powerful and the double shower curtains didn't leave floor soaking afterwords. Also bed very comfortable with lovely clean sheets and nice soft pillows.   Swimming pool area with plenty sunbeds and the Sun in right time - it went behind the high buildings after 4pm though and it was a little bit to cold to stay at the pool. The gym small, but well;4
It's very conveniently located hotel, free airport shuttle service takes about 10 minutes to get to the hotel. Room was basic and clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom was spacious. Staffs were friendly.  Definitely I will stay here again.;4
The porter Miguel was very rude and was making racial comments. The hotel itself was nice but the bell service was awful. It was so bad that it ruined my stay. The bellman Miguel spoke down to my wife and brother and then when I called him on it he said racial comments in spanish thinking we wouldn't understand him. I won't say exactly what he said but just that it was derogatory towards caucasians.;1
Excellent hotel for LAX access. Has everything you would expect from an airport hotel, and also has a few good restaurants on property. The rooms are in need of updating, however interestingly...the bathrooms have been updated to the new Marriott style (all white, etc). While the rooms are older, they are in good shape, and provide a great place to get some sleep, and again excellent quick access to LAX.;4
We stayed for one night, actually about 7 hours on Feb 6 - 7.  While this hotel is close to LAX (we had an extended layover) that is about the only good thing we found during our stay.  The hallway was noisy due to the building design.  Parking was poor - old and tight lot with security not working the night we were there - anyone could enter and leave the parking lot without requiring a room key or other form of control.  The shower in our room did not work - the knob you pull up to get the water to flow from the shower head would not stay up.  We woke up at 4:30 AM to leave the hotel by 5:30 AM in order to get to LAX for an early flight.  By the time we realized the non-functional shower there was no time to move to another room or do anything.  We had booked the room thru;2
Came here for a night. Quick ride to airport. Nice staff at check-in and bar. Room had comfortable bed 😴 and despite being near airport, slept fine.  I requested a quieter room. The room was cold however, and I couldn't get the heater to blow out warm air. There also wasn't a central light in the room, which meant lamp-only light--not the smoothest when arriving in room or checking out. Overall decent, efficient, and double up the blankets.;3
We stayed only one night and it was really just to sleep. Check-in was smooth. We had a nice quiet room, not a lot of noise in the halls or from other rooms. Of course, this is at the airport so you will hear airplanes landing and taking off, but even that wasn't too bad. My only complaint is parking is $32 per day. Lame.;3
After Delayed Delta flight caused me to miss my international connection, I had to spend the night in LAX hotel. Found this reasonably priced hotel and my down mood was elevated by the amazing staff. FREE Shuttle driver , check in staff, housekeeping, concierge and restaurant staff were incredible. Arriving @ midnight, got late checkout free. Lunch was amazing with the LAX morning sandwich with best fries I’ve had in a long time. Having Delta ruin my carefully planned trip, these Four Points staff really elevated my mood!! And the lobby is REALLY cute & comfortable!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼;4
Check in was smooth and easy. Paulina was very welcoming by recognizing me as a Marriott employee. she made it a great stay already . got us in a nice clean room and let us know about happy hour which is always nice !;5
Hotel public spaces are fresh, open and well maintained, the gym is also well kept and equipped.  Rooms were a little dated but everything worked well.  Staff was polite and professional.  Shuttle service to LAX worked well too, no complaints.;4
Driving up to this place it appeared like what you’d expect from a four points. The lobby, the front desk area were really nice. But you go down the hallway to a bank of 3 elevators.. 2 of which were in disrepair. The part of the hotel they stuck us in was out of a 70’s motel room. Old broken furniture, old carpet, old doors. Housekeeping was knocking on the doors at 9:30pm to clean. Breakfast buffet was $21 each and was something typical of a free buffet offered at a motel 6. Waste of money. Not impressed. Lipstick covered ... you get the drift.;2
Just had to swap flights and needed 24 hour check in this hotel obliges but be warned we checked in at 2300 and 24 hours is not being asked to vacate constantly from 1800 the next day.  I did have to tell housekeeping that we where going to be out at 7pm and we constantly got bothered trying to pack up and leave which only delayed our departure. Other than that breakfast was great and server Jesus was awesome.;4
I was there for a conference, and got to be assisted by Estela Estrada! By far the most attentive and amazing customer service I have received by a hotel staffer. I would recommend her for every conference they have!;5
Usually stays at Sheraton Gateway LAX, but thought I would give it a shot once at Four Points LAX instead.  Room is fairly simple and basic, but has large space considering I was staying in a basic room (can't remember the exact room type). In general it was clean and I did not have much of an issue staying there.  What was interesting to note was that there was no room service menu in the room, which in turn I did no bother to ask further and just head down to ground floor of the hotel which has a small restaurant. Food was OK and inexpensive.  My only comment is about the shuttle service. So most of the hotels around LAX has frequent shuttles, but for Four Points I had to wait 30 minutes. By then I have seen at least 3 to 4 rounds of other hotels' shuttles gone by. I am very;4
Firstly, arrived at 4am,at L. A. X and was told I would be given a hotel shuttle service, WHICH NEVER TURNED UP!! So with no mobile to use to ring a cab, I asked a employee of lax to phone me a cab, cost $20 as it was the lowest fare he would take. Then arrived at the hotel, to be told, they had no reservation for me, and even worse no room to give me. After explaining, I had emailed the hotel twice, telling them I would arrive at this time, and used their live chat service. Who had told me to book, their would be no problem. The young lady was very abrupt and difficult. Still kept telling me, there's no room. Then I started to get annoyed, and magically after going into her screen, a room suddenly appeared?? Why couldn't she just apologise and give me a room immediately? Never;1
I left a cruise - where I work - and was at this property before noon, wondering what kind of wait I would have, and was checked right in!  Had a comfortable day of rest before a long flight the following morning.  Lastly, the shuttle service to LAX, only five blocks away, was courteous and efficient.  This is your go-to for this airport!  Plus, reasonably priced.;5
"I recently stayed with a friend for three nights.  The room was clean and everything worked.  The bathroom was small, but efficient.  What really stood out to me was that every single employee I came in contact with was friendly, courteous, and helpful.  That is priceless.  As others have mentioned, only one out of the three elevators, in the area where I stayed, worked; however, it was never an issue.  I never had to wait longer than a minute or two.  Also, the shuttle to and from LAX was extremely helpful.  If your plans bring you into the city, depending on traffic, expect an hour drive.  So, traffic aside, I highly recommend this Four Points by Sheraton.";4
I stayed here on the night before my flight.  It served it's purpose of getting me to the airport quickly and the shuttles run frequently.  The room was in pretty bad shape.  I felt like I was back in an old 1980's motel, so hopefully they are renovating the rooms soon.  If you want a convenient place to avoid the morning rush to the airport, and don't mind a fairly basic hotel room, this is the place for you!;2
I needed an overnight stay at LAX and though this might not be my first choice, Four Points is a very good option. The hotel is in fine shape. The rooms are quite spacious and the bathrooms good, too. It has a gym and pool (though untested by me). I was warmly welcomed and helped by the staff so this is a warm recommendation. By the way, the cost is very competitive...;5
We stayed here for two nights including New Years Eve. The hotel rooms were very nice. We were not at the hotel a lot. We got picked up by the free shuttle at the airport and it came every 30 minutes. The driver wasn't the friendliest however.;4
I stay at this hotel when in LA on business. It’s conveniently Located to LAX and, as such, you do hear the planes and the hotel can be busy late at night with pilots and airline staff, but this was not an issue for me.  There are some wings that have been remodeled and while I have stayed in these rooms, this trip I stayed in one of the older rooms, which was still adequate. However, there was no overhead lighting (lots of lamps!), so it was a bit inadequate for me when working.  The Wi-Fi can be slow at times and the TV was incredibly slow in between commands. There was a fairly large refrigerator in the room, which I always appreciate it and while the bathroom was small, there was plenty of counter space. If I’m correct, I believe the hotel may still be under construction.;4
This hotel has wings that have older rooms.  All were too small and I upgraded - ie. paid more because I booked online with a non-refundable .  The hotel has some maintenance issues so did have sections under construction.  Huge airline clientele so late night the lobby fills with pilots and airline staff.  The room was not to my teenagers standards who would prefer large rooms and greater amenities.  I most didn't like that sports channels weren't part of the cable so to watch the local World Series  I had to have dinner or drinks in the lounge.  A huge breakfast buffet isn't important to me, I'd prefer hotel packages that include a breakfast because this cost was higher than the value to eat breakfast at the hotel.;3
I booked a short stay at the Four Points at Sheraton near LAX recently. The front desk clerks are friendly. The lobby and rooms are clean. There is a timely airport shuttle. However, the elevators call-buttons don’t work well (there is a sign apologizing as they are under construction), I heard loud clanging several times during the evening, breakfast is not complimentary, and the area in general is a food desert in that there aren’t many restaurants within walking distance to buy from. I asked the front desk clerk and she stated that options are mostly this hotel and other nearby hotels (probably averaging $17 per meal). Needless to say, if you are on a fixed budget, I wouldn’t recommend this hotel for this price currently because of the added cost of food, it’s renovation;3
"Be careful, this hotel has an old building annex beside it. Rooms are outdate, bathrooms are small, sheets are old and disgusting (they've changed color into like mold). The blinds that cover the complete glass windows was broken. 2 housekeeping agents just woke us up in the middle of the night and asked for our personal information. And when I informed front desk, they made it seem like I had to ask for a complimentary breakfast, instead of just offering it. ""Do you want free breakfast?"" Instead of just offering free breakfast for the inconvenience. Not that I want it. No, thank you.  I have worked in the hotel business for years, and these brands especially have to maintain a standard, satisfy a customer experience, and provide great service. This hotel has none of that. It";1
Let's start with the elephant in the room, their elevators are death traps. No, literally. They  have a glitch where they stop at EVERY floor. Imagine being placed on the 9th floor, going up and down is a hassle. The rooms are moldy, the carpets smell wet and they have some sort of 70's pinstripe wallpaper that has food and other matter encrusted on it.  The staff is incompetent and gives you false information, and you have to pay to use the computer in the 'business suite'. Stay across the street at the Renaissance if you can. to be fair, their breakfast was good, and the service in the breakfast buffet was great, that's the ONLY good thing about this dump.;1
Booked this hotel for a 2 day stay on business. Noticed mold in a picture in bathroom first night and was very disappointed considering the cost. Second night noticed dirty carpet, stains on walls and urine stains on wall behind toilet. Not acceptable! Decided to leave. When they asked why I was leaving they said I should have said something and they would have moved me. Given condition of room, it should have never passed inspection and should not have been assigned to any guest;2
"We've used this hotel in the past and always enjoyed our stay.  However, this time we were left to stand over 30 minutes in the cold and windy weather at the airport for a hotel shuttle that never came.  We gave up and took a taxi.  Once at the hotel, we were told that there were plumbing problems and the higher priced room we had reserved was unavailable.  We were given a horrible cheaper priced room with no working heat and were told that we would be given a complimentary breakfast as compensation.  Upon checking on the breakfast, my husband was told that the complimentary breakfast was the ""free"" coffee in the room.  The elevators we used were creaking and rumbling and other guests told us that all the elevators were scary. We were so cold all night that we had to use bath";1
I have read a number of the reviews, not sure what people are expecting.  This is the Four Points not the Four Seasons.  Hotel is very convienent to LAX and the rental car lots.  We waited for about 15 minutes of the shuttle that took us to the hotel.  I’d say that is very good considering the amount of traffic in LAX.    Check in was fine.  Was upgraded to Junior Suite.  All that being said, hey its next to an airport and two busy streets, it is not quiet.  Walls between guests are thin, easy to hear your neighbors.  But like I said, what are you expecting.  Wants high quality construction, you don’t get that for a 109 a night.    For what it is, I think it is a pretty good value.  Location is hard to beat.;4
the accomadation and room was fine , the clocks were wrong and the quilts were washed so many times and the stuffing was in a ball  , very uncomfortable to have over you and of course the parking is 32.00 bucks a day;2
I am an SPG and Marriot member. I enjoy their hotels around the world and I also expect that any car rental agencies in their hotel is approved by the hotel and upholds their standards.  In August I booked a car at U-save car rental in the Four Point Sheraton Hotel LAX. The rental was for November 21-25. (Thanks giving weekend) When we arrived at the car rental agency, everyone seemed to be upset. U-save car rental was insisting that everyone purchase their extra insurance. It did not matter if you where Canadian or American. They were forcing people to buy their very high-cost insurance ($27/day). When it was my turn I showed them I have full insurance coverage with our credit card and with our own car insurance. I also showed them both insurances and the part where it says to;2
I stayed here in July for a night and the workers were very nice. Everyone welcomed us every time we can inside and the lady at the desk only charged me for one parking spot when I had 2 cars because I rented a sports car in LA and I had my own car as well. I didn’t try the food because I woke up too late but the hotel itself is very nice, had a pool and a gym and many other rooms to explore. The only downside were he elevators.. I had to wait over 10 minutes for my elevator to pick me up when I was headed home, I didn’t want to use the stairs because I had luggage other than that I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to LA and it’s near LAX!;5
"I work for a company that likes to ""try out"" hotels in each city. Needless to say, of all the airport hotels in LA, this one so far is the worst of the five I've tried. It is a ""tired, dated"" property that feels like it a flash back to the 80's. Clearly the hotel has renovated certain spaces to appear modern but it literally is a dark, depressing property that is working in bits and pieces on how to bring it up to date. Having said that, the rates are not less than the other better properties on the strip.   I was checked into a room who clearly had carpets cleaned that same day and after 5 minutes in the room, I was congested and wheezing so requested a change. I got to the second room and similar to the first found a dark room (they use only lamps but have the ""blue white";2
Maybe it started bad because i waited 45 min for the shuttle and I just wanted to end my day.  I got to my room that was tired an old.  Put the window blind down and the chain broke.  Went to use the bathroom and the light switch was not totally attached to the wall.   The tub was old and stained.  Lucky for me I got to the hotel at 11 pm and left at 8 am.  Can’t say I would be back;3
I have always had a very high personal opinion of Sheraton in general. I send my employees to stay at Sheraton’s and always try and stay at a Sheraton when I have a chance.  My last stay here has made me rethink my preferred choice of hotel.   This hotel shows well from the lobby but that’s about it.  After a long drive with my family it took 20 minutes to check in with 4 people at the front desk but only one checking people in.  We then waited for the elevator which seemed like an eternity. Later we found out from other guests that the elevators seem to have a mind of their own and stop at random floors.   Unfortunately they do not have room service so I had to wait for 45 minutes to get a couple cheese burgers to go for my kids before bed time.   The rooms we very dated and;1
We purposely chose to stay in the LAX area as it appeared on the map as a good home base and picked the Four Points after viewing traveler photos in TripAdvisor and reviewing the most recent comments. We arrived on the redeye and were greeted by a pleasant front desk clerk. The room was nice and the window looked out to planes landing but surprisingly we could barely hear any noise. The bathroom was clean and for two persons it was supplied with four sets of bath linens. The only hiccup here was that the lotion appeared to be a used one. The bed was very comfortable for a good night's sleep. Our grandson came to visit one day and as toddlers are wont to do, he walked and played in the room barefoot and that is when we saw that the carpet was dirty so I left a note to the;4
Spent one night before flying back to Europe the next day, staff was helpful and friendly even though the hotel was super busy with people coming in an out. Location is great, it's super close to the airport, they even have an app to let you know when the shuttle will be there.;4
The Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles Airport took three $50 deposits from me -- for a total of $150 -- and 11 days later my money has not been returned. I have incurred late fees from other merchants because the hotel has kept my money without a legitimate reason. I have called the hotel several times. I have spoken with at least three different staff members. I have emailed the hotel twice. I have left at least two voice mails. The hotel responded by minimizing the inconvenience, asserting that the delay of my money was not unusual, and finally, when they did admit there had been a mistake, the desk manager Maria acted like she was doing me a favor by finally admitting they had not refunded my deposits, which I had been telling them for several days. To break it down: 1. I;1
You can tell this hotel supports mainly travelers to and from LAX. All night you could hear people arriving and departing, doors slamming, talking in the hallways, constantly being woke up. We stayed here as it one of the hotels United Airlines uses for vouchers on missed flights due to mechanical issues. The hotel does have a free shuttle to and from LAX. Luckily the night was free compliments of United but would not select this hotel if you are paying and you need a good nights sleep.;2
Choose this hotel only for its convenience to the airport terminal. All other hotels seem to run more frequent transfers between the airport and the hotel. Food is average and grossly overpriced. Room standards are tired and need to be upgraded to merit the cost and the rating. Lastly don’t leave anything in error at this hotel, you won’t see it again even when you contact the hotel and tell them exactly what you left and where. Disappointed!!!;2
Stayed here for 10 days for a conference. It was nice and only 5 minutes from the airport. Staff is extremely friendly, helpful and full of smiles... And Graciela is a gem!!! Just the sweetest lady :);5
I Love this hotel. The staff are all nice and helpful ,Front Desk, CONCIERGE and Bellman and Driver of the shuttle to the airport. The nicest shuttle I Have ridden in for free. The rooms very clean with amenities. The Bed was very comfortable.;5
Nice place, everything fine, 5 minute ride in the free shuttle to and from LAX. Will stop here again for an over night stay when flying elsewhere onwards.  Food nice and Beer nice, but its the usual 'Close to the airport expensive prices';5
I travel a lot and this is one of the worse stays I've had. Let's start with the back elevators. After waiting for minutes for the elevator to arrive, it would stop on every other floor, if not every floor. We were on the 7th so imagine dealing with that all weekend. Then the shower was clogged. Maintenance had to be called so I wouldn't be taking a shower & a bath simultaneously. The arm to to parking gate was malfunctioning & the line would build with people complaining about paying $32/night to park. Breakfast was mediocre, I've had way better. I could go on but I'm done. I won't be returning here.;1
This is a big hotel, and as such is a bit clinical and faceless. We were only staying one night before flying home and as such it was more than adequate. The complimentary shuttle is a nice touch  Their systems were down when we arrived so check in was a bit of a nightmare plus service in the bar area could have been a lot better. Location is good for LAX and drop off for hire cars.;3
This is the perfect location ifyou are without a car. Cheap to take a taxi to or hotel shuttle. Airport is less than 10 min. away. They have a pool, restaurant and gym. Seems like it's a lot of business clients. Easy commute to the beach which is about 15 to 20 min. down the street. Hermosa beach is our favorite spot.;4
"This hotel should NOT be part of Mariott...it is so low class. Old rooms, that smell. Horrible night sleep. Front desk changes depending on who you speak to. They leave in the middle of a question to go to the "" back"". HORRIBLE service. I think Mariott should get inspectors in there and strip their name. This hotel is a dump with a miserable staff of dopes at the front desk and managment! AVOID at all costs!!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Angel at the front desk has zero hospitality or manners.  All the other bad reviews are correct, The worst hotel and should be not part of Mariott its a horror! If you go for your work, internet is slow and awful!";1
We stayed one night at the hotel, our check in was quick, we asked for a toothbrush and toothpaste, they deliver it to our room. Our room was clean with a decent size of a tv. They had a safe box but not a fridge. Their parking fee is $32 per night. They have a decent breakfast buffet. There is a small cafe at the hotel, that serves coffee, juices and snacks;5
We stayed for one night to catch a 6am flight the next morning. There happened to be a motorcycle club staying at the same time. I was hoping they would tire of revving their engines before 11pm, but I was not so lucky. The revving, loops around the parking lot, and vulgar music continued through the night. In fact, it was still going on the next morning at 4am when we caught our shuttle. The hotel staff chose not to engage the club members.;1
We have spent the night of 2nd November till 3 rd November. We choose this hotel to be close to the Airport and to rest from our previous long trip. We had the whole day and night to suffer with considerable permanent noise -  and full non stop high level radio - of a group of Harley Davidson motorcycles just on the parking lot of the hotel, which is just down under all the rooms facing the main entrance of the hotel. This situation did not seem to trouble the hotel reception who naturally answered me that they were clients of the hotel and that they have the instruction to stop their noise at 10 p.m. This finally ended to be a lie since the whole night started back during the night, where we could hear the huge noise of motors as well as radio.  I can understand that Sheraton;1
We were upgraded to a deluxe King room for no additional charge, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The bed wasn't very comfortable either. I wasn't in the best mood due to the fact that the Dodgers were in the playoffs and due to insanely stupid tv contracts, the hotel rooms didn't have the game. The staff was friendly.;3
Had booked a one night stay prior to an early flight out. When we arrived around 11pm we notice that people was waiting in the lobby witch we didn't think much of, but when we wanted to check in we were notified that the internet was down and that it had been down since 10am. The manager was clearly overwhelmed and had no idea or plan on  how to handle the situation. nothing was offered to the waiting people in the lobby... no drinks or food, no shuttle service  to neighbor properties. What surprised me is that not even to gold or platinum guest was any information passed or contact to let us know about the issue. I could even cancel my booking, called Marriott/SPG customer service and had them help with a new booking at a neighbor property. Still haven't heard anything back;1
Stayed here for one night on our way to Puerto Vallarta. The rooms was everything we needed. Clean, cool and comfortable. Free shuttle from the airport and the shuttle driver was really cool. By only complaint was a slow check in but to be honest they had a tour group and a flight group checking in while I checking in also so that’s kind of a push. The room was basic but served its purpose as we both got enough sleep to head to LAX in the morning. My wife and I joked about what happened at check in. When I checked in the clerk thanked me for being patient while waiting and said she “upgraded” us. When we got to the room we were on the 2nd floor above the front door to the hotel right next to where the shuttle parks. We laughed when we asked ourselves what kind of room they were;4
This is a very basic airport hotel, good for quick overnights. It has a free shuttle that helps but otherwise, I would probably give this a miss if other options are available. Price while not expansive was certainly not not cheap either.;3
I was TERRIBLY disappointed with this facility. Although this is a Sheraton/Marriott, and it has the right colors and the right curtains, clearly the owner does not give a flip about the property. It really is a dump. The carpet in the rooms is buckled, the chairs are threadbare, the pillows have not been replaced in I don’t know how long, I didn’t even know that there was a “duvet” on my bed because it was a thin as a sheet...I could go on. And, the parking was a NIGHT.MARE. When I returned from dinner one night, I had to drive around for 15 minutes looking for a space, and I ended up illegally parking by a garbage bin. We had a conference on Friday and Saturday, and on that day, the attendees could not find parking—some had to park at two other nearby hotels, some had to park;2
I cannot believe that this dump is owned by Marriott! We were 4th in line to check in, but it still took 40 minutes. Then, even though we had paid online they still made us sign a BLANK credit card slip. We asked to have the amount included on it and were told “l can’t do that, and I will cancel your reservation if you do it”. Once he had the signed slip he disappeared into the back room for 5 minutes. It seemed awfully fishy. By that time the line to check in was out the door. We finally got to a room, but there was already someone in it. So we dragged our luggage back down 4 floors and started over. It was miserable! The halls are dark. The room was more like Motel 6 than a Sheraton. The inside of the comforter was so filthy looking my son would not sleep with it. Oh and the;1
When we checked in, the desk clerk, Courtney Peters, did everything to welcome us. She was sweet, generous and professional. I hope her manager recognizes her.   Unfortunately we did not have a favorable experience when we checked out. They charged us incorrectly for almost 40 dollars and when we spent way too much time addressing this no one apologized. This should be addressed.;3
Unimpressed. Very average. The shuttle took atleast a half hour to get me from the airport. The driver was very niice and helpful but then check in took forever and then food at the restaurant took forever and the room was not very nice and just very blah ! I wouldn’t rebook.;3
This is a decent hotel at the airport. It’s a short shuttle ride, and the shuttle leaves regularly. The front desk is nice and check in was pretty quick.   The hotel is undergoing renovations, which it desperately needs. The lights in the hotel were very white and not relaxing. The bed was comfortable, and there is a nice plug next to the bed to charge your phone. The doors though, are very thin and I could here people opening and closing their doors all night long.;4
The place is in good location but rooms are out dated and after many calls I still did get an other room if I had a choice I would stay at an other place they definitely needs to improve rooms to keep this brand reputation;3
The hotel itself was ok, the problem I had is trying to get the $50.00 deposit back that they put onto my credit card.    It has been over a month now. I did learn a lesson from this and that is pay the deposit in CASH, don't let hotels put a hold on your credit card.;3
The quality of hotel rooms is not good in comparison with other Fourpoints hotels over the world, location is near to the Airport but far from the downtown, reception, restaurants, and lobby are fine but the room it's looking old and the bathroom as well, overall not very comfortable stay;3
This hotel used to be one of my reasonably hotels to visit but NOT anymore. The service has gone down & the rooms are not as clean as it used to be. Checking in takes along time & I was not pleased with my room. Front desk workers need more training & help to lessen the wait time.;2
I booked and pre-paid for a king bed room. When I checked in at 11:30, I was told they’d given the room away, despite acknowledging it was prepaid and non-refundable.   Put me in the worst wing of the hotel. The “centre wing” which have windows facing a hallway and blinds that let in a ton of artificial light from the hallway. Felt like I was in a prison cell with no natural light or airflow.   Room was old and very noisy. Anytime a neighbour used the bathroom it rattled in my unit. I got no sleep when the whole point of staying near the airport was to get a good might’s sleep.   The room was hot and stuffy.  Bed was small and uncomfortable. If I couldn’t decide to change bed preferences for my prepaid room at the last minute, how is it legal for the hotel to unilaterally;1
Can't believe some of the bad reviews, did we stay at the same hotel or just a different wing?   We stopped here three times during September (on arrival from the UK, Prior to a flight to Hawaii and returning from Hawaii prior to return to UK and had no problems at all!!) On our first stay (tired after a long flight from the UK)we were allocated a room in the east wing directly above the pool area which was very noisy due to a Labour Day Pool Party in full swing with loud music, we rang the front desk with our concern and within ten minutes the front desk manager and bell boy arrived to escort us to room 611 on the 6th floor of the west wing. We requested this room for our 2nd and 3rd stay and were happy to be allocated it, even when checking in at  4am following a 4hr flight;4
"My wife and I stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel near Los Angeles Airport (LAX) one night September, 2018.  I had booked and paid for this some weeks earlier.  When we checked in in the afternoon, we were assigned to a room on the third floor with what looked like two double beds. We immediately called the front desk to request a change to a room with a King Size bed.  The man who had assigned us our room agreed without hesitation to give us a different room, and directed us to return to the front desk to pick up the key to our new room. He told us that he was moving us to a ""deluxe king"" room. When we got to the room, we found that it had two queen size beds. While we prefer a king size bed, we have no problems sleeping in a Queen Size bed. We were in a hurry, and did";2
I'd give 2.5 stars if I could.   Pros: -shuttle service to/from the airport was efficient  -clean  Cons: -confusing layout  -very slow elevators in back -remodeled lobby looks pretty good, but every piece of furniture was uncomfortable -less than mediocre food at the restaurant  -room feels old. Not a huge deal, as it's a quick overnight stay, but it kind of screams out for a remodel  -here's the worst part. Check in. For us, it was slow. We watched the line grow while hanging out in the lobby. Two people checking in a line twenty deep.  -$21 for a buffet breakfast seems steep;3
Thick fluffy towels. Heated pool. Free wifi. Spacious rooms with fridge and coffee maker. All the basic amenities you need in terms of toiletries daily in your room. Luxurious bedding. Across a mall. Perfect choice. Would book here again;5
Damaging Sheraton name!  The room was dated, hard to maneuver with your luggage from one wing to the next, no bellboy service, the room reminded me of Motel 6, bathroom was old and hot/cold water didn't work right. For the amount of what I paid close to $200/night I should be better than this. But the shuttle bus drivers provided great service. The bar area was nice at least I can get a late night food there since the restaurant closed, didn't feel safe walking by myself to the fast food restaurant near by.;1
Great location for LAX flight transitions. Hotel shuttle runs every half hour. Across  the street from Budget Rent A Car. Other car rental companies nearby. Rooms have been recently remodeled. Restaurant and bar are average.;4
First off...beds are like sleeping on a slab of concert.  No sleep all night.  After flying for five hours back from Maui, waited 45 minutes for Four Pts shuttle.  NEVER SAW ONE.  Tons of other hotels shuttles going by and stopping.  After 45 minutes, saw one Four Pts shuttle in lane four, as far away as possible, with no passengers.  Never stopped.  Finally called the hotel, who informed us they would let the shuttle driver know we were waiting.  After waiting another 20 minutes or more (I'm so tired and mad by now), we got on a Marriott shuttle, and WALKED DRAGGING OUR LUGGAGE A BLOCK TO FOUR PTS. where we see the shuttle with no one in it.  WTH?  I will never stay there again.  May never stay at another Sheraton period.;1
Check In Check in process was pretty good once I found the reception desk, which was hampered mostly in part to a very large number of people who had arrived in front of us clogging up the lobby. Staff were pleasant, that's the best I can give.   Room Clean but outdated, in need of a revamp and freshen up. Bathroom was just as bad. Room did not meet the description on the hotels website. Beds were uncomfortable and pillows hard. Beds were meant to be pillow top didn't look or feel like that to us and the view was meant to be of the runway or pool we got the parking lot. (See next point) Cup and glasses in the room was disposable not glass or china.    Customer Service None. I went down stairs to question the room we were given as it didn't meet what had been described. Only to;1
The shuttle service was excellent (only a short wait, both round trips), checkin was fast and professional and our room though a little tired, was spacious, clean and very quiet - no aircraft noise. My only negative comments would be that the room was a bit dark, there was no frig and the toilet/shower was very small.   We went into the bar a couple of times, the staff were very friendly and the bar snacks very tasty.  The location was good, only a short walk to Dennys and other fast food outlets if you don't want to eat in any of the hotels.  Due to a change in plans, we ended up having to stay an extra night. It was Labour Weekend, and very busy, however, staff were extremely helpful. Special thanks to Monica and Hugo who both went the extra mile for us.  The pros quite;4
Excellent customer service.  Location was great.  Stepping inside the hotel, it gave us a positive impression- surroundings was neat, organized, clean smelling environment.  The overall ambience of the hotel was elegant and modern which was a reflection of how they can keep up with the competition in the area.  Will definitely come back!;5
Hotel is 5 mins drive from LAX airport and you can get to the hotel v.v. via shuttle service which runs every 20-30 mins. Look out for the bus in black (with Four Points Sheraton logo).   If you need a place to rest for a stopover or a short trip, this hotel is decent enough. It has a very comfortable bed for a good night rest.   However, if you are particular on location and room interior, this hotel may not be for you. Room interior looks a little run down and the lift needs maintenance.;4
Landed and waited for the shuttle for 30 minutes. The driver was friendly, got me to the hotel. Quick check in. The room was on the small side but the bed was comfortable. Usual Four points amenities. Remember you won't get individual soaps or conditioner. The shower curtain was more of a suggestion than a barrier to water so the floor was soaked when I got out. quick checkout then no wait for the shuttle back to LAX.;3
I booked this hotel several months ago for one night (8/30/18) prior to a cruise out of Long Beach. After booking I read reviews and some were positive but the vast majority were negative, some even very negative. Since I pre-paid the booking through Priceline I was stuck with it. I was not very optimistic about what I would be walking into.   Was I surprised! My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised! The hotel’s shuttle bus was clean and roomy and the driver was pleasant. Every staff member that we had any interaction with was also very pleasant and helpful.   We were meeting another couple that wouldn’t be arriving until about 10pm and I asked the front desk clerk if she could put them near us. She said sure, and gave them room next to us.   Our room was spacious and;5
What amazing staff they have here! Early checkin - no problem, park the bikes for a couple of hours - no problem. Free shuttle to the airport - no problem.  This speaks to really good management because it doesn’t matter what staff member you speak to the answer is YES!  They helped me out last year too when my flight was cancelled so was my 1st choice to come back. The same fab service is on offer, so I will be choosing this hotel again next time I’m in LA!;5
I've stayed at numerous LAX hotels and went to the Four Points on account of value.  The plus is their bar area is actually craft beer focused.  At other hotels in the area they have a minor selection of local California beers, but here they do take pride in offering a bit more of a local flavor.  The food was average but beverages certainly made up for that.  The rooms are decent.  A bit dated but clean and nice as expected from the Four Points brand. My only complaint was the shuttle bus.  The pick-up frequency was abysmal.  I waited curbside over 20 minutes while watching several other shuttles pass by multiple times before the first Four Points shuttle arrived.  That detail alone will make me rethink this hotel before booking on a return trip.;3
The staff here are welcoming and the lobby bar a great place to grab a bite, have a drink, or just hang out. The facilities and the rooms aren’t fantastic, but comfortable and everything you need for an enjoyable stay. The pool is great as is the gym. I felt at home here, relaxed and well looked after from the time the shuttle dropped me off at the door to the time the staff bid me farewell. I’ll definitely be back;4
This is a great hotel ninth making but they appear to be dragging their feet especially the lifts. The rooms have been updated and are in generally a good standard but the windows need double glazing-real double glazing as the airport noise as well as the air conditioner units on the roof of what is probably the convention rooms can keep you awake at all hours if your a light sleeper. If you are staying there make sure you ask for a high floor to minimise rad, airport and air conditioning noise.  Bathroom has been upgraded to a good standard since my last stay and appear to be holding up to the general wear and tear that usually disappoints the travellers looking for a clean room.  Restaurants, pool area, gym and business centre were all more than adequate and the 3 day stay was;4
The lobby and the surrounding area were very nice - modern and updated.  But our room was out dated.  But when I saw white sheets and noticed they were clean, as well as the bathroom that made all the difference in the world.  This was a final stop for us before getting on a plane to head home.  So - quick tip - less expensive, and close to the rental return locations.  We got there, checked in, then I returned the rental car and walked back to the hotel.  The next morning (way too early in the morning...) we took the hotel shuttle to the airport.  It saved us alot of time.;4
This place calls itself a hotel. It is no more than a glorified MOTEL. The walls are paper thin and you can here every single noise in this place.We ordered 2 chicken panninis are were proudly brought 2 chicken burgers with every soggy buns. Wasting your time complaining as the waiters suffer from selective english. On the up side like everywhere else at LAX the pickup and drop off serice from your terminals  is free and pretty good. Sadly only 2 out of 10 from me.;2
I work for a cruise line and was sent here from the airport before signing into my vessel the following morning after a 12 hour flight from Vienna. My stay was comped by my company, as were my two meals. I was happy with lobby, and the check in process. The lobby is more updated than the rest of the property.  I stayed on level 4 of the east wing. I appreciate the efforts they are making to update the property and think that I would rate a weak 3 stars, with these updates earning a solid 3 stars. Room was quiet, television had a non functional and dated remote, bed was VERY comfortable, and the ac worked well. I turned it off since t made a fair amount of noise, but enjoyed the white noise while sleeping. I ate at the comfort dining room for breakfast and enjoyed the service, as;4
The Four Points at the LAX is the worst Sheraton I’ve ever stayed in. I’m a huge Sheraton fan. My first job was as a busboy at the Sheraton Anaheim in the 1970’s. But people, this place was as uninviting as you can get, starting with the entrance. There’s no place to park you car to check in. You have to go into the dumpy, overcrowded paid parking lot ($32 per day) before you can get to the very hard to find front desk.   Rude staff, dilapidated elevators, outdated rooms with cottage cheese ceilings and a mediocre restaurant await your arrival. (Jaime at the restaurant was a fantastic employee who helped improve my experience with this hotel.)   This place needs a major overhaul if it expects to get repeat customers. The Sheraton Gateway, only 1/2 mile away, is vastly superior;2
Check is was very smooth as we arrived late on at night. The room was very clean and had shampoo, conditioner and body wash provided. The bed was super comfortable. As the hotel is right beside the airport I was surprised at how minimal the noise affected the room, we could see the planes but could hardly hear anything. When we went down to get our shuttle we were lucky the shuttle was waiting there. It is every 15 to 20 minutes from the hour which i super convenient.;4
"30 minutes spent waiting for a shuttle -- that's absolutely unacceptable! You're only 1 mile from the airport! It's a cruel joke that when you get to the room they have a little flyer in there asking for a 5 star review and they list ""increased shuttles"" as a reason.  Yeah right!   Lots of other annoyances but they're mainly related to status.  I would post on the Marriott site but apparently they don't allow reviews from verified stays.";1
Spotlights illuminating outside of hotel building made it impossible to sleep. The blackout blinds left space all around, causing our room to be bright as day. Picture was taken at 3AM.   Drain did not work. Tub filled during shower. I expected more for this type of hotel;1
"Used this hotel for 1 night when I was in LA; I was going to a different city the next day. So I chose a hotel that is relatively inexpensive and is close to the airport & rent-a-car shops.   There is nothing around the hotel (other than other hotels), so you definitely need means of transportation. The shuttle to the airport is free though.  They had a billing mistake (putting an incorrect fee on our bill), but the front desk noticed it and made corrections for us. So no problem in the end.";3
It was just an average hotel with average services except for the staff at the tour desk which provided exceptional service.  Got a room that had a locked safe and it took 4 call reminders to have it opened.   Failed to replenish water, tea coffee unless reminded.;3
We needed to leave our vehicle while we traveled to Europe. This hotel seemed to fit the bill with hotel stay before and after flight, covered parking and airport shuttle service. On site restaurant was convenient as well.;3
We checked-in to this hotel after a long drive across the desert.  We were hungry and decided to settle for the hotel's restaurant as there isn't much else in the area.  I had the chicken wings and they weren't very good.  The restaurant is poorly lighted.  My wife was using her phone which shone on my wings.  One of them was completely black inside.  I'm just glad I was able to evacuate this unpleasant meal before my flight home.  Service was unacceptably slow.  The house beer is terrible.   Overall this hotel is decent in terms of a place to sleep.  Four Points can always be counted on for a decent sleep.  Front desk staff were helpful and friendly.  We enjoyed the pool even though the heater was reported broken.;4
Everything about this hotel is great except the bar and pastries. Drinks had no sophistication, service was ok. Breakfast pastries were stale, but tables by the pool are nice. Didn’t try the buffet after tasting a really poor croissant. Other than that, the staff was friendly and rooms were perfect. Lobby was bustling at all times but no long lines for anything.;4
This is in definite need of marriotts intervention as soon as possible. It needs a lot of work to bring it up to standard. It’s just dated. The rooms are adequate but very old fashioned even down to the switches. Having said that, it’s clean, bar is good, food is good and the staff I came into contact with were friendly. Free shuttle, free WiFi, extortionate parking fees are the norm for airport hotels and this is the case here. Once spruced up a bit it will hit the button,  it’s wedges between a Marriott and a Renaissance so needs to up its game;3
Traveled on business and had an extended stay of 10 days.  My room did not include a refrigerator or microwave. i could have PAID to have one but common on, I'm there for 10 days.  Couldn't you have at least thrown in a Frig?  Room was clean and comfortable. I liked the restaurant especially the locks and bagel in the morning.  It's quite large and sumptuous - if they have bagels.  First day I ordered it, they didn't have any.  Bummers;3
Came to LA to visit my cousin who was visiting from London. I prepaid for a 2 day stay and extended for another day. The room was very clean and nice. The room was very spacious, but I wished that the dresser had drawers to place my clothes in. There was an iron and ironing board which was a big plus. I like the fact that they stock the rooms with complimentary water.;4
Some mixed reviews of the LAX Sheraton.  LAX is really tough to get in and out of, so you might be in a bad mood before you even get to the hotel.  We spent a night here for an early morning flight to Costa Rica.  I would probably try harder next time to set up my flights so that I don’t have to leave the airport.  The 4 points Sheraton is definitely a tired hotel.  The elevators are bouncy and slow, the A/C fan in our room sounded like it had rocks bouncing around in it, and everything is a little dated.  We had asked for a room with two beds, and they gave us one with a single queen bed.  They weren’t able to change it so we made due.  On a positive note, the small restaurant was pretty good and the staff was good.  On the way home, we stayed there again and at the airport, my;3
I am a big fan of Sheraton properties and try to stay in them whenever possible.  This one has me baffled. It is the dingiest, most depressing of their properties I have ever stayed in.  The room is crammed full of badly worn furniture that you can’t use because of how tight the space is and the second bed touches the window. The lighting is all fluorescent and you can hear all the street and airport noise.  For the price, which is in line with the rest of the nicer hotels around here, this is really disappointing.;2
From the beginning, from airport shuttle to the hotel itself. Terrible! The shuttle bus is shared between several businesses, by the time the bus left the airport for the hotel, there were so many people on board, feet were getting stepped on... I'm sure it was beyond legal capacity! When we arrived at the hotel, there were many peopl waiting to check in, at least a dozen! The process took forever. When it was finally my turn, the gentleman helping me was short and to the point. Not unfriendly, but definetly not welcoming. When I entered my room, there was an overwhelming smell of cigarettes! Disgusting! The room was just okay...nothing special. One problem in the room, there was no information for guests. Nothing! My room faced a large parking lot, very noisy. As were the;1
"Best customer service person here is Paulina M! She is patient, helpful, and always cheery. The pool here is lovely, food is just okay (no room  service). We spent several weekends here for conferences and Paulina is our ""go to"" person, reliably helpful every time, with a great attitude. Other staff is also tuned in to guess needs. Outside noise remains a concern, but actual rooms are clean and some are updated.";4
After long flight from London, friendly and courteous staff welcomed us to the hotel. A pool party was in full swing, but tired from the 10 hour flight, it was no problem to find us a quiet room away from the music. Room was very comfortable for a good nights sleep, and the in-house restaurant fayre was filling to eat! Refreshingly lively for an airport hotel, and gave us good rest to start our long road trip ahead. Only temporary downside was the lifts are under repair (Aug 2018) & we had to wait patiently multiple times!;3
Avoid this hell hole at all costs . Fire alarms constantly go off in the middle of the night and management are useless and rude. After the alarms went off for the second time around midnight we could not get an answer if the hotel was on fire or not or another “test”. The elevators stop at every level and don’t bother trying to use the fire escape stairs - the doors are locked. Management ignore phone calls and emails when your stay is terrible in this dump . You are better off sleeping on a bench at the airport , safer and most likely cleaner too ! Avoid . Avoid . Aviod .;1
We stayed the night before our flight left because we wanted to be close to the airport. The hotel overall was nice, but the room was very outdated. The lobby area has been renovated, but definitely not the rooms. It was OK for what we needed, but a little pricey for a Monday night. The shuttle was perfect for our short drive to the airport and the shuttle driver was very nice.;3
We spent here 2 nights with my families and we got 2 rooms. The rooms are without windows. The rooms of my suns booked for 4 people had 2 queen beds (a bit small for 4 people). The second night I tried to park the car inside the hotel parking (very expensive) and after more than one hour and a half looking around for a place I decided to leave it out of the parking. Later I found out they had an event and even if the parking was already full they were selling parking space.  At the check out I claimed about it and they did not asked me to pay for the parking.  In general it is a good hotel.;3
Recently stayed at the four points Sheraton by the Los Angeles airport great hotel I totally recommend five star service five star staff restaurant has delicious food rooms are very spacious beds are comfortable very clean as well.;5
I recently stayed at the Four Points LAX hotel and my stay just like most was wonderful. I must state that on my very last visit I had the pleasure of interacting with two employees who define what going the extra mile for the guest experience is about. They promptly brought a resolution to my issue and with a transparent sense of pleasure for not just doing their job but helping people. The two employees are Trish D and Pauline M. Both ladies are front desk staff and their actions truly embodies extraordinary customer service.   Thank you ladies and all the other warm and smiling faces at the Four Points LAX hotel, Hi 5 to you guys.;5
My family and I have been traveling the U.S for 3 weeks,we wanted a week to relax in L.A with a rental car,Four Points LAX is surprisingly perfect for this,we have parked our car easily at a discounted rate and we have managed to get to everywhere we want from here,staff are lovely,clean rooms- not the largest bathroom,lovely pool- maybe needs bigger pool towels,bar,fantastic restaurant for brekkie & dinner and Denny's a short walk,my only dislike are the lifts- apparently being upgraded but an air hostess told me,the lifts have been a pain for over a year,please hurry and get them fixed;5
They gouge on the parking. They severely limit the free Internet. We were on the second floor, and the nearest working (and nearly empty) ice machine was on the fifth floor. The bathroom had soap & shampoo dispensers on the bathtub wall like a cheaper hotel. Our room had no refrigerator (I'm assuming that's reflected on the amenities list on the booking websites).  The overall vibe is they're cutting corners and charging or overcharging for services just to squeeze an extra buck, without adding value for money.  Their upfront price might be a bit better than some other hotels near LAX, but if you need anything more than a bed, I'd choose a different place.;3
I know this hotel is relatively well-reviewed, but our experience wasn’t good.   The good:  The lobby is new, clean and modern. The bar is large and well-taken care of, and the bartender was friendly.  The bad:  On one bank of elevators, only 2 of the 3 worked. Long lines and very slow. And the other bank didn’t work right either - automatically stopping at every floor.  The room was so-so. The thermostat wasn’t adjustable so hope you like the current temp. The bathroom was tiny - like TINY tiny. There was also no hand soap or cups. The beds were supposed to be queens, but were basically just full.   Parking is $32/night. That could be standard around the airport, but still expensive for a hotel of this caliber.  Finally, the bar is very expensive. A standard size glass of local;2
only good thing about this hotel is the early check in stayed here one night before moving on first room had noisy air conditioner asked to be moved to another room .The next room was fine except it was  facing the airport and had no block out curtain on large window. Did not get much sleep because of the lights from airport and budget rent a car directly opposite kept me awake  got up early morning to have a shower in the bath tub combination only to find the lever for the shower did not work.  On my way back home I had already booked a further 2 night stay so asked for a quieter room the room was quite except for the a/c which sounded like a jet engine and the room was full of furniture and cramped the bathroom was small and pokey but the room did have full block out;3
Arrived the afternoon before our early flight (0545 am) and decided to park and use the shuttle from the 4 Points Sheraton LAX in stead of waking up at 0 dark thirty. The hotel is older but looks like they are trying to update it. Nice room, it served the purpose of sleeping.   We hung out by the pool for drinks and relaxing.  Some guys outside the pool were blazing up with some bad skunk weed.  Didn't want to engage some hood rats so I went to management and the hotel security jumped on it and chased them off.  Ate in the restaurant and food was good. Very accommodating for my wife and daughter who are GF.  Chef came to the table and personally took their orders and made their food.  Good beers on tap. Shuttle was easy and quick.;4
"The hotel is located right up the street from LAX, so I'd have thought the airport noise would be worse.  I was glad to find out that it wasn't.  In hindsight, I wouldn't have booked the hotel, simply because it isn't close to anything.  Everything we did required a long drive in the rental car.  It's something to consider if you are planning trips to Disneyland, Hollywood, etc. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  Because we were staying for a few days, the woman who checked us in ""only"" charged us $19/day for parking, which still seemed steep, but considering we had no other options, we were grateful for the discount.  The parking is tight, but I found that to be the case in almost every lot I used in California. The room we had was very clean and comfortable, and";4
I want to thank the front desk ageint Hany S.  individually. He is so great, eager to please and good man, my flight was delayed , so i arrived next day, Hany S helped me to save my booking, i am really glad that in the hotel is still working good people ready to help you;4
Arrived late at night with small children for early morning flight the next day. Check in was smooth, though hard to find registration desk. Parking was in the back of the hotel in poorly lit, desolate lot with small spaces—did not feel particularly safe ($32 per day). Elevator was momentarily stuck on one floor. Room was very dated and “exterior” window faced a hallway..could tell this used to be a motel and that they slapped on a hallway in a “remodel” to give impression of a hotel. Muggy and hot in the room with no A/C unit or control to be found. Phone to ask front desk for help did not work. Won’t be staying here again..or any Sheraton property for that matter.;2
We only stayed one night after flying in from Australia, hotel was clean and facilities were good. Left my phone on shuttle bus, fell out of coat pocket, concierge was excellent in helping me get the phone back.;4
I’m not from a big city, but LA is too much.   Check In was slow, parking way too expensive and the smallest spots ever. Pretty tough to fit a full size SUV in the parking lots and still attempt to get out of the doors.   Older hotel and the rooms feel dated. Lots of street noise in the west tower.;3
We both stayed here from our road trip from Las Vegas Very nice room staff great restaurant quick and prices ok. Shuttle bus to airport every 30 mins. Tip the staff after getting your luggage from your room and you are first on the bus. Return hire car car parks within 1 mile from hotel Would use and recommend this hotel;5
The check in process was quick and the staff member was great. The rest was downhill from here. Lifts pretty much did not work, restaurant had mysterious opening times and returned one evening to find blood stains on our “newly made up bed”. Call to front desk and not even an apology or acknowledgement of how disgusting this was. To top it off our second night of a 2 night stay we were treated to absolute chaos of multiple fire alarms (including a number of evacuation alarms). On entering the lobby on 2 occasions the staff did nothing to explain or enact any type of emergency protocol to a number of irate and confused customers. The LA fire department also looked frustrated with the staff and process. There was no direction and staff continued to work at desks and not even;1
Our experience at this property on July 25th and 26th was truly disappointing and frustrating. First, the property definitely requires renovations. Rooms are dated and need to be thoroughly cleaned. We had dust and dirt all over the stuccoed ceiling, in particular over the bathroom sink. The ventilation vents were disgustingly dirty making one wonder what exactly is blowing into the room.   We were only at the property one evening with our 2 young daughters the day before we departed home. For 2 hours, ending around midnight, the hotel alarm sounded. Although a false alarm, it took hours to resolve with tired and frustrated families in hallways and in the main lobby. Our daughters actually felt ill due to the stress of the alarm sounding and inability to fall asleep. Thankfully,;2
Stayed one night after a flight from Australia and pre our flight to Vancouver the next day. Hotel lobby is located inside the hotel and not near the front. I found the low ceilings a bit claustrophobic but the staff were ok. Gym on the ground floor, well equipped. Pool area adjacent to the lobby. One bar/restaurant for dinner serving mostly pub style food and a seperate breakfast restaurant. Rooms were a bit dated but functional. No in-room safe and like most US hotels, no refrigerator. Unfortunately our night was not a pleasant stay as the fire alarms kept going off, apparently a fault in their system. Just get back to sleep and off goes the alarm again. What was disappointing was that there was no advice forthcoming as to what was the problem, was it a false alarm etc.;3
Bad hotel. Rooms are very old and moist. Not really friendly staff. Have to pay for parking place. Close to the airport. There is a shuttlebus from AirPort to hotel. There are no restaurants in the area.;1
Nicely renovated and conveniently located close to LAX.  Rooms are clean and spacious.  We had a corporate event at this hotel and the service was ok but not excellent. The meeting rooms were spacious and clean.  AV equipment worked properly, although very over priced.  Communication was slow to get things done (pre meetings) and on day 1 the food was terrible .  After giving some feedback, they delivered better meals and service.;4
I was there for a meeting that happened at this hotel that is a few minutes from LAX, where I landed.  There is a complimentary shuttle that is frequent and dependable.  The wait staff in the bar are fun & food is good.  The rooms are clean but simple. Staff very helpful with local suggestions.  I’m going back in August for another meeting.  The price was modest.;4
This stay was a complete disaster from the beginning. The front desk staff was rude and seemed inconvenienced by any questions. The elevator was in the process of being “modernized” ,which meant it stopped at every floor. Once we got to our floor we were punched in the face by cigarette smoke smell, and had to lift our bags over a mini fridge that was blocking half the hallway. The rooms were okay until the A/C unit turned on. It was extremely loud and turned on even when we had turned it off. To top all this off they make you pay $35 for parking and $21 per person for breakfast. Do yourself a favor and don’t stay here.;1
Monica was very professional, caring and knowledgeable at the SPG check in.  Her kindness, communications skills and understanding made our stay very enjoyable! Our rooms were very nice.  The facilities were clean and updated.;4
During my recent stay, the type of room was not reserved for me/family.  We had to stay in a small one bed room for the night because it was late and we were tired from a long commute.  The room was quite small, no small refrigerator.  Loud AC unit.  Outside noise from nearby warehouses was annoying, the window not double pained because Airport noise could also be heard. Bedding stained and didn't look clean.  Bathrooms are very small and shower knobs are reversed. Breakfast buffet is too expensive. The best thing about the stay was the on-site restaurant which had affordable delicious meals. The parking area is very crowded, dark at night and located at the back of the hotel. There's an outdoor heated pool with plenty of lounge chairs and a bar. No Jacuzzi though.  Elevators;3
overall: Good location. Hotel seems to be currently under re-construction but does not effect guests (e.g. during my stay repair of the elevators). Breakfast needs improvement (for some Europeans the scrambled eggs are disgusting). Interior fitting modern and not too overloaded (i.e., in a pleasant way this hotel lacks somehow the typical American 'interior-bombastomania'). Rooms and bathroom very clean. Swimming pool in rectangle shape (i.e., for a swim this is a better shape than the round one in the Sheraton Hotel 'next door').    in particular: Staff is very helpful, very friendly, and is providing very good service. There are some staff members that do even more and have made my stay a nice, relaxed and very comfortable one. One staff member stands out: The receptionist;5
I had early flight so i booked this hotel. I made a request thru email that i needed early check in and i was glad that when i check in at 11 am, the room was already available. Comfortable bed, clean and spacious room.;4
Hotel is ok for airport hotel. Just know, they have rooms that have a window to a hallway. Hotel staff moved me to a room with a window to outside without a problem. They akso had know problem with my late checkout request.;3
When we arrived we couldn’t check in until 3pm which isn’t a bad thing but when you’ve flown 14 hours and arrive at 8am you kinda have to find stuff to do. The guest services guys were 10/10 for customer service we were looked after amazing by these guys. The room is self is old and outdated the bathroom was dirty and there is no black out blinds so the sun shines right in at 5am. It’s also very noise you can hear doors slamming all night. The hotel lobby has a great coffee spot had great service and coffee there and the dinner bar was great. There is no room service and Doing your own laundry will set you back 24 quarters $8usd  (the machines only take quarters). There is no shuttles from here into town but they do offer a free airport shuttle, this price for hotel is a bit;3
On the way out to Asia, I was forced to overnight in SFO due to a delay by United Airlines for a full 24 hours but I didnt expect to overnight again in LAX on the way back. This time I was simply shocked at the quality of hotel they had sent us to (esp. after the outbound trip UA had initially refused to put us up in a hotel and all the other inconveniences).     The hotel is the usual property one can expect for a tourist class/category. The public spaces seemed ok (looked like they had renovated). The hotel seemed to be linked by a center tower (which turned out house the room we had stayed in). This tower seemed like an old motel that linked the two tall towers. One had to passed thru' a set of old door by the vending machines and a very old corridor that leads to the rooms.;2
Dreadful room that had a window onto the hotel corridor. It had supposedly been upgraded but it looked old and tired and smelt mouldy. Air con didn’t work properly and no one answered the phone when I rang down to ask how to get the temp changed. (It kept flicking back to 80 degrees) Think there are better places at LAX to stay.;1
A couple of friends and I planned to stay for 4 nights. When we first arrived the light was broken and so was the air conditioner. We asked for room service and they fixed up the light and tried to fix the ac. The next day rolled around and the 117 degree weather only exaggerated our problem. We were kindly moved to another room but again the ac was horrible and loud. The staff were extremely cooperative and friendly especially seeing as many people were complaining about the ac. We decided to cancel the remaining two nights and they did not charge a cancellation fee, they also gave us an extra night free as well as a breakfast for 7. Unfortunate circumstances considering the friendly staff and close location to LAX.;2
This is perfectly okay for one night having just landed at LAX.  The bar area also doubles as a cafe and is okay for a beer (although the food is not so good).  There are worse places near to LAX to have to stay in.  It's not cheap for what it is but then it is an airport hotel.;3
Stayed here one night in a King Deluxe Room.  Shuttle was quick and easy.. the motel is only about 1.6ks away from United's Terminal 7. The check in was quick with only 1 person in the queue in front of me and three check in desks were open. The lifts/elevators were not busy but so so slow. Finally got to the room which is a strange mix of modern fittings and old furniture. Bed was comfortable with nice pillows (bigger than regular size). Towels were a good size and fluffy. Double glaze windows .. so the plane noise was minimal. Transfer back to the airport was again simple with the shuttle running every 20-30 minutes and only taking 10 minutes to get back.;4
Nice hôtel vert well located near the LAX Airport. There is a swimming pool and two restaurants. Breakfast starts at 06.00 and costs 21 $ (plus tax) not a rich buffet, just ok. There is a shuttle service to and from the airport every 20-30 minutes which Is very convinient. No shops around except if you wish to walk for 20 minutes where you can locate an AT&T shop, some dinners and few more.;4
First our room was not cleaned, left over food in the fridge and blood on the papers. They moved us to a junior suite, the TV didn't work, the sheets were filthy stained, half the light bulbs were burnt out and the tub drain was clogged. They sent someone up to fix TV, he shifted it back and forth for about 20 mins, said it's good to go and left. We turned it on and it still didn't work so my fiance spent a half hour fixing it himself. We left a note for cleaning lady to please replace the burnt out light bulbs, which she clearly ignored. Parking is $32 a night but we stayed for 10 day's so we got it for $18. We got a huge door ding and witnessed someone else getting a door ding the next day, and when we called to tell them someone was sitting in their car with their door up;1
Crazy bad. Sevice is bad. Card is not working. Parking ticket is not working. Why I have to so many times stop by front desk? She gived so bad room. Front desk person,she is not qualified. I will not use this hotel forever. Please I hope you do. So stupid woman.최악의 호텔 프런트 데스크 여자는 숙련되지 못했고 업무를 잘 몰라서 고객을 아주 불편하게 했다 이 여자 직원 때문에 아주 많이 화가 나고 다시는 이 호텔을 이용 하지 않을 것이다 고객을 불편하게 하는 이호텔은 반성하기 바란다;1
We waited for 30mins for the hotel shuttle to pick us up from terminal 6 at LAX at 7.30pm on a fri night. It wouldn’t have bothered me but we saw most other hotel shuttles pass us by two or three times. Checkin took a while as there were only two staff working at the time so they clearly weren’t prepared for the large numbers of people on each shuttle, even though the driver radioed in to someone. Had a drink at the bar and ate some light supper, service was slow to initially serve our table but improved after that. Food was reasonably priced and tasty. Room was ok, beds and pillows comfortable. Aircon was noisy and clunky. Was a little annoyed there was only one bottle of complimentary water in the room even though there were 3 of us, and 3 towels. Our room was in the East wing;3
We stayed here on a layover on our way to Hawaii.  Newly updated and clean.  About 3 minutes away from the airport so it's easy access and a nice hotel for the location.  We did not eat there but the bar area looked nice.;4
I am really shocked that this is a Sheraton branded Hotel with 4 star rating. Absulotely the worst you may think of. DO NOT book a room in this hotel. The worst treatment you may expect from the managers. No safe books and they will act as if they don’t know that. No self parking !!!! Only valet for 50$ per night !!!! Very noisy as it is close to the airport and the windows are poorly sound prove.  Basically, Bad Expeience.;3
This is not fancy but it gets the job done.   Stayed here for four nights with my family while exploring L.A.  The hotel is a bit tired. It doesn’t feel very modern. A renovation wouldn’t hurt. The rooms are clean though.   However, I’m still satisfied. That is due to the fact that we didn’t have any problems of any kind during our stay. Everything ran smoothly. Every staff member we encountered was very polite and helpful. The restaurant was good. Housekeeping did a good job. Parking was fine, even got a discount upon check in.   So, to sum up, on par.;4
The place is clean and is easy to get in and out of...The rooms seem dated and small, friendly staff, easy check in...Popular place for conferences...Bar and restaurant located on the main lobby floor and close to LAX;3
Absolutely terrible experience and hotel. East wings rooms are like a old bad motel with terrible linens. Manager unwilling to assist me but willing to assist walk in with no reservation paying cash. I would never ever stay here again. Terrible Terrible experience. Frequent traveler and tops as worst hotel and experience.;1
We booked this hotel just after I booked a flight from Australia that would have got us there at 7.30pm. Qantas changed our flight to arrive at 6.20am rocked up not knowing what to expect ,Friendly staff could not do enough for us room available and after 14 hrs  THANK YOU  This hotel has everything you need if your just overnight and flying out the next day Really Friendly Happy Staff ,Great Bar/Restaurant that we enjoyed after a sleep, Next time we are back No Brainer  you got us;5
There seems to be some difference of opinion about this hotel. Four points is a step down from a strandard Shreraton but still quite good. It is in no way a budget hotel. Therefore, since I was able to book the hotel for the same price I would pay for a Best Western or a La Quinta, I feel like I had made a really good deal. The hotel is only about 5 minutes by shuttle from the airport. The shuttle circle the terminals so no need to phone the hotel. The only downside is that the shuttles only come every 20-30 minutes so you may have a bit of a wait. Check-in is quick and simple. There is an advantage of being a SPG member since you get a room on a higher floor plus the hotel was happy to oblige with a 1 PM check out time (I had a late flight). The rooms themselves are perfectly;5
Stayed here for one night, 0.5 miles away from LAX. very busy roads, parking for one night was $30... hotel itself, was nice and clean. room was a different story. very old and bland. kind of wished i didn't stay here. i would not stay again, its good for a quick night stay if you are waiting for a flight. pool looked nice from afar. bar downstairs had good drinks. staff was friendly, they also have  a car rental place inside.;3
This hotel is having the best hospitality. The best person we met in this hotel was Mr. Musie Kashai And Faruqque, they guided us everywhere we required as we were new to their country. They made our journey very comfortable and superb. Thanks to them for their best hospitality.;5
This hotel is total mixed feelings. The hotel itself is nice, the guests are completely mixed. Some guests are great, wonderful, normal guests, others are less than savory characters. I forgot my room key and the front desk was wonderful with their security procedures. Night security guy, he's a character but completely amazing and our favorite employee we met!;3
Booked a 24 hour stay at this hotel. This was perfect for us as we flew in from Australia and wanted our room from 8.00am. As promised the free shuttle bus was running approximately every 15 minutes, so we hadn't long to wait before we were whisked away to the hotel which was at the most 10 minutes away. All the staff were great very helpful and welcoming. Our room was ready immediately and we had use of it until 8.00am the following morning. The room was spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. Good shower and nice toiletries. There was a bar, which served basic snacks in the evening and the restaurant was good value for a buffet style breakfast. We found a local bus which took us to the local mall about 20 minutes away. Great Macys store there.  On check out, once again;5
The check in process is smooth and fast. The staff is friendly. The room is great. However there are no nearby restaurants. Need to walk around 10-15 mins to nearest eatery. Overall its a great SPG hotel;5
Have long layovers in LAX recently and have used this hotel 3 times , once as a dayroom and other times for overnights. It is a busy hotel and older but perfectly adequate for a layover and good value at LAX. the staff are all super sweet and are really accommodating to travellers that lets face it are mostly tired and weary.  they don't do room service anymore but do a grab and go from the two restaurants or they have a coffee/muffin bar. The cleaners keep the rooms super clean.;3
reached around 9 pm for checkin but there was no one to help with the parking. stay was good, they provide fridge, coffee maker  as well as microwave in the room which is very useful. one thing which needs improvement is bathrooms, the fittings are very old and the exhaust does not work. no kids channel on tv.;4
Stayed here for one evening in February 2018 whilst picking up a connecting flight from LAX to Cabo San Lucas (We flew into LAX from London Heathrow).  The hotel runs a shuttle which collected us from just outside the terminal and took us to the hotel which was quick and easy.   Check in seemed to drag on a little but maybe it was because we were jaded from the flight.  We arrived at the hotel around 11pm LA time and they had stopped serving food, so we headed to our rooms.   The room was large and clean, but outdated compared to other hotel which I have stayed in during time in the US.  The bed was comfy and the air conditioning was great.   We had to be back at the airport at 5.30am and there was no food available in the hotel for breakfast which was disappointing as we;3
Avoid, low value for the price. The room i got had the electrical outlets not covered, cables sticking out the wall, it is an electricity hazard. I wrote an email after checking out to the management but they did not bother answering. Parking is a ripoff.  The brand would suggest you are getting something good. In this case you are not.;1
On Friday, June 1, 2018 my sister and I checked into this hotel after enjoying graduation ceremonies and activities for my niece.  We had an early morning flight and the location could not have been better with the Hertz rental car location for drop off in walking distance and the hotel shuttle to the airport operating 24/7.   We checked into room 531 in the evening by a very friendly hotel front desk clerk. Our room was just right for our needs since we were only staying overnight. It was a good size, clean and comfortable.  Cleanliness is top on my list when rating a hotel room and because of that, I would return and recommend. There was nothing out of the ordinary here, so consider this a solid place to stay if you need Airport access and proximity to basics ( Starbucks, CVS;3
It’s close to the airport and has a 24 hour shuttle. That’s the positive. For the rest.... check out is long with surly counter agents, you can hear everything from outside, oh and the bathroom lights have motion sensors that will make the lights come on if you move on the bed.;2
Stayed here for one nite for a layover with my family. The room and bathroom was very dated, old and musky. I really would NOT recommend this hotel for anyone.   The only good thing was distance to LAX for our next flight next morning.   I am sure there would be better options around.;1
Needed a room before we took flight from LAX the next morning. This hotel had a good price that fit our needs. Free shuttle to the airport next morning worked out great. Room was very good, plenty of room and clean. The staff was very helpful and showed us when and where to be ready for the transfer in the morning. Only negative was one place on-sit for dinner and it was a bar area. Had to walk a ways to eat.;4
"We just spent five nights at his hotel for a jazz festival. Yes, this is a three star hotel that is rather dated.  Yes, it can be rather noisy both from the AC/heat unit and noisy area.  The bathroom was tiny.  The best part of the hotel were the people.  Our cleaning lady, Aurora was outstanding.  She made sure she made up our room while we were at breakfast.  The breakfast crew where fantastic! One gentleman had been there 22 years and took very good care of us.  The waiters in the bar/restaurant did a great job.  The rest of the staff were friendly and did a great job during the festival. I guess my biggest ""beef"" was with the free shuttle and the cost of the parking.  I had done some research and found that people complained about this also.  We were renting a car from";2
Nice hotel. Would chose a better room if stayed longer than on night. Nice clean room but basic no aircon and right at the back wing. Nice pool and friendly staff. The shuttle service was great. Nice bar and restaurant in hotel.;4
We recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while visiting LA. We were looking for something that was easily accessible to The Forum since we were there for a concert. The Uber ride was less than $10, which was great. The hotel was nice and clean, and the front desk staff were friendly and knowledgeable.;4
After a horror flight from Australia with many problems it was great to arrive at this hotel, we arrived well after we were expected and it was not an issue, we were greeted by a lovely lady at check in who got us settled quick smart, our room was very clean and comfortable, after cleaning up we headed to the bar for a bight to eat and something to drink, staff were amazing, food was great and drinks were nice and strong, used the free shuttle from the airport with no issue and used it again the next morning with no issue, highly recommend this place to stay;5
We stayed here for one night prior to our flight home to Australia. After checking in we discovered that our room was opposite the elevator so we requested to change rooms, which the reception staff did without question. Our second room had a faulty air conditioner which wouldn’t turn off, consequently the room was freezing cold. Back down to reception, who said that they would get someone to look at it while we went out for dinner. When we came back from dinner the AC was still blasting non stop freezing air so back we went to reception at midnight and again the reception staff moved us to another room. Feeling a bit like goldilocks we stepped cautiously into the 3rd room but this one was “just right” and we had a great nights sleep.  All in all an adequate hotel for what we;4
Very clean! I always look for cleanliness and this one was definitely clean!  Bed was super comfy!  Didn’t have to deal with the staff much except at check in and check out but all were very nice! Would definitely stay here again!;5
Had a one night stay and was booked into the Four Points for the night. Decent hotel, though I would have expected faster check-in at 11:30pm. Overall the staff was friendly, the room decent and they have Brewster's for drinks and food. Not certain I would stay multiple nights given other choices around LAX, but worked for a 7 hour stay;4
Needed somewhere close to airport for 2 nights before flying back to Aust.  Caught the shuttle from airport after downloading their app adter flight from Seattle.  Professional and friendly check in, quick to room which is always appreciated if late at night. Room comfortable with all the right amenities eg comfortable pillows, nice towels etc. Had breakfast first morning in restaurant but went to coffee shop the next. Granola, fruit and yogurt was good, ordinary coffee but that is just indicative of North America amd there lack of coffee culture. Last day after check out I needed something to fill in time so the concierge arranged for me to go on LA tour. Worth thinking about if time to kill, tour goes for 5 hours and got dropped off back at hotel at 7.45 with still enough time;4
This was a great stay. Juan checked us in and was awesome. We had champagne and a cheese plate sent to the room and a $25 credit. I am a Marriott employee celebrating my college graduation and i appreciate them making it special for me. We had lunch at the restaurant and it was good. I love the fact that you had a little coffee area with snacks. The only downfall was my room was 81 degrees when we checked into it and it took a long time for it to get cool in there. But overall great stay;5
"The difference between a three and a four for this hotel has to come down to the staff.  Everyone I've spoken to (or whom spoke to me) was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The rooms do seem to be a bit dated but they are spotlessly clean and well furnished.  As expected, the food in the on site restaurant is a bit costly, but consistent with similar hotels of this caliber.  The real downside for this trip was the $32 daily parking fee (no ""in and out"" privileges either).  That makes a somewhat pricey room downright expensive and that's the only reason that I feel compelled to lower my rating to only three stars.";3
Left clothes in the wardrobe on 11th May 2018, rang the hotel on the 13th and spoke to housekeeping - yes they had found the clothes and it would be no  bother to Fed Ex them to me.  Reunited with my clothes 2 days later.   Thanks  Juano from housekeeping.  Fantastic service;5
"The Front Desk Staff at Check Out were GREAT!! Very nice ladies and always carry a smile! When I called to ask about the shuttle and other inquiries the lady that answered me was great at answering my questions and didn't seemed rush at all; At least I was not transferred to a dispatcher or another department.";5
Whilst not the cheapest option near the airport, it certainly is a good mid-range option. The shuttles to the hotel are very frequent, from both the domestic and international terminals. The hotel itself is spacious enough with ample on-site parking available for a fee. Inside, the lobby is welcoming, with plenty of seating space, a cafe and easy access to the pool, although it was too cold for a dip when I was there.   Checking in was a little slow, about 20 minutes before I got served. It was just bad timing, I think, as when I was done, there was no one else waiting in line. The common areas of the hotel seem a little dated, but most importantly, it was clean. I had a room that was in the tower at the back, so maybe the tower closer to the lobby desk may have been more;3
The room looked like a cheap motel.  Screws were jutted out of the shower handle and ceiling was moldy.  Closet was dinged up real bad and outlets were broken.  The bed was really bad and the springs in the mattress were super squeaky.  I didn’t think they had Spring mattresses since the early 90’s either?  The breakfast was very bad and very expensive.  While paying, the waiter asked if it was a lot more than I was expecting since I didn’t eat 75% of it.  Honestly, it was the first meal I walked away from hungry in my life.  That is saying something.  The parking lot was a bad situation as well with trash all over the place.  Finally, the bar was falling apart.  I got a drink and as I sat in a booth the bench seat flopped backwards and the wood trim on top flopped 6” up and;2
Great location relative to LAX. Okay neighborhood. Good service staff. Full services including great bar. Hotel clean but becoming dated as a facility. Good food. Plenty of parking. Lots of escorts stay here.;3
The Sheraton Four Points is a perfectly good hotel.  Everyone there is extremely friendly and hospitable and responsive to taking care of things that need to be taken care of.  That's the only real problem, there were things that needed work.  A typical problem with hotels these days seems to be maintenance.  There is no proactivity in fixing problems, problems that should be noticed by housekeeping or regular inspections.  The room didn't have some of the typical amenities such as a microwave or fridge.  They did send up a fridge, but whereas most hotel refrigerators don't get things very cold, this one literally froze everything that went in it.  There was no way to adjust it.  There were problems with the TV, the shower didn't drain well, and lamps were unplugged.  All minor;3
"I always hate leaving peoples names in reviews but front desk agent ""M"" was training someone when I checked in. She informed me that she could not find my reservation, which was prepaid, and instead processed me as a walkup reservation, meaning I had to pay again to get my room. All that hassle and I never even got credit for that stay! I had to contact the property to have the double payment reversed. The room was missing the tray that you put your coffee pack into. After two calls and one trip with the whole coffee maker, I was told in a rather condescending manner that someone would come up and show me how to use the coffee maker. Yep, never happened, nor did I ever get a tray for the coffee pack. I'm not sure what it is about broken windows and LAX but he is yet another";3
Nice Hotel not too far from Los Angeles International Airport. Free shuttle to and from airport helps after a long international flight. Rooms nicely appointed with everything needed for a restful nights stay. Bar area nice with good bar food. Will stay again when next in the area.;4
I only recommend this place if you’re trying to save some money. Otherwise this is a cheap place to stay.  The 8th floor is only accessible by stairway and it is haunted (no really...go see for yourselves).......  The shuttle never arrived at the airport so I hoped on the shuttle for the hotel renaissance and walked over  They don’t use fitted sheets  House keepers started knocking on the door around 9am  No microwave or fridge (and I was told my room was being upgraded)  Arm and a leg to park here;2
Spent one night at this hotel near LAX. Good hotel, good restaurant, good clean room and comfy bed. Free shuttle to the airport and a decent gym. The only negative was that it was a bit noisy due to the thin window pains and lots of traffic outside. Also, the restaurant in the hotel was very good.;4
Stayed here for one night only thankfully. In my room I had a stand-alone fridge with a microwave on top????? The AC was so loud it was almost defining. The pillows are dreadful cheap and nasty. I rang housekeeping and asked for a firm pillow she arrived with two more of what I already had!!!!! The rooms and bathrooms are small and the updated furnishings just don’t go far enough. You pay a premium price for a below par room. I will not recommend or return. Also I had to ring them to get them to e mail my bill it took 5 phone calls. They said they had the wrong address yet there marketing team seemed to have the right one as they e mailed to ask if I had enjoyed my stay! No I didn’t;2
I had stayed by the LAX at another comparable hotel last year and Four Points by Sheraton was by far better in terms of sleep quality.  I heard no airplane noise and it was a comfortable stay overall.  However, the rooms were outdated and it was motel style (i.e. your window looking into a corridor, but not directly to the street).  As I said, overall it was comfortable but nothing to write home about.    The check-in experience was very fast and friendly and the shuttle arrived in about 5 minutes of wait at most.;3
My stay here left quite a bit to be desired. The hotel shuttle eventually came after seeing other hotel shuttles repeatedly pass me by. I arrived at the hotel and was checked in. Check-in was average, and the lobby was noisy with a few seedy characters hanging around.   The room itself was on the small side. I was disappointed to find noise from the neighboring streets and airports could be easily heard throughout the night. The bed was comfortable. The shower was poor and the amenities, in bottles attached to the wall versus individual bottles screamed cheap. The shuttle back to the airport in the morning was PACKED with a noisy and obnoxious (but what else would one expect from such an airline) Spirit Airlines crew.   Overall, there are better hotels in the area. I'd avoid;2
Stayed at this hotel twice now and still not impressed. Used this location as it was close to LAX. Shuttle service from airport was poor. First time shuttle ride from airport during first visit, the shuttle driver made eye contact with me, he asked me to move aside as people were getting off. I had two luggages with me, I thought he would help me after the passengers left,  instead he hopped back on to his shuttle THEN LEFT! I later saw him at the hotel after I checked in. The 2nd time again from the airport on Monday, April 30th shuttle #23 around noon -hoped in on her shuttle as it clearly said the hotel name and on her next stop said, “I don’t stop at FOUR POINTS LAX” so my sister and I hopped out... and later saw the shuttle driver at the hotel! Talk about par below customer;2
Before I left Cairo, I emailed the hotel and asked about the shuttle service for arrival in LAX.  I landed, turned on the phone, and had a response.  I was happy to know that I didn't have to arrange the shuttle, as it arrives every 30 minutes, so if you miss one, there will be another around shortly.  One thing that stood out was the staff.  They were gracious and friendly upon arrival.  Although it was a quick stay, it was a comfortable one.  We flew in from London and had a layover before we returned home.  The room was clean and well prepped.  Beds were comfortable, and I was able to get a great nights sleep after a long day.  Wake up call come right on queue, and we were met by the bellman at our room shortly after our call to the Front Desk.  We were back on the shuttle,;3
We stayed there for a night layover because we had the flight next morning and for that it's ok! They provide a free shuttle. Now, when you put Sheraton in the name of something your expectations REALLY grow.. and that was only makes us be more critical about everything.;3
I went on their website to book a one night hotel room and up to 14 day parking.  Their website clearly states you can book one night and park for up to 14 days.  They actually offer three rates depending on the number of parking days you need. I went through the process and booked the hotel.  However, the hotel booking never said anything about the parking.  So, I called the hotel to make sure we also had the parking.  They said they did not have that type of rate.  I directed the manager to their own website, which they pulled up while I was on the phone with him.  He acknowledged what it said, but said they do not have that rate even though they advertise it.  We cancelled our reservation.  Not sure it is legal to advertise a rate and amenity that does not exist.;1
I stayed in this hotel overnight with husband and two kids. We checked in around 9:30 pm so it was already late. When we got to our room and settled with the kids , the AC fan was extremely noisy , we complained and someone came over but could not help except suggested to slow the AC fan down , which made it even more noisier . Opening the window was not an option as it was even more noisier outside with those machines on the roof right outside our room. I am surprised how come the hotel finds it okay to give people this horrible room . We did not have the option to move around the hotel to switch rooms with a 4 month old baby and a 4 year old , late in the night. Worst hotel experience in USA. I m not able to attach the video I recorded of the noise here but that would have;1
This hotel is just ok. I booked as a surprise deal where you don’t know that hotel name.  If I’d known I probably wouldn’t have booked it.  But actually hotel is fine.  Clean enough. Location fine.  Coffee machine in room. Pool looks fine for kids  Cons: -noise. I stay at lax all the time.  I found the plane noise really loud - self carparking is $34. Say what?  That obscene  I don’t think I’d book this hotel but it wasn’t terrible.;3
Have been Platinum Elite with Marriott for 6 years going into my 7th, Gold with SPG 2 years before the merge and now Platinum with SPG since the merge.  I travel a lot and stay in hotels around the world about 230 days out of the year.  This was the worst stateside hotel experience ever.  If I was alone things may have been different but I was in LA for 1 night with my mother and brother to see Adam Sandler.  We arrived at the hotel at 12:30 and was told they can put us in a regular tower room right away, or wait until 13:30 and will be put in their remodeled SPG Tower where all rooms come with refrigerators and are nicer rooms.  So we drove around and returned at 13:30 to check in and head back out into the city and explore since we only had 1 day.  The first room we were moved;1
Just needed one nights accommodation prior to starting by USA adventure. Arrived early and Monica on the front desk was super helpful. The sight I’d booked via had gotten my last and first name around the wrong way so when I was trying to checkin there was no record of my booking. Monica did all she could to help me and eventually found my booking. Was able to check in early which was great after a 14hr flight! Room was good, clean and refreshed from last time I stayed here!   Free shuttle from airport was also convenient.;4
The hotel is fine really, big lounge, airport transfer and helpful concierge. However it’s let down but the dining options. Online there appears to be several available but in reality there is one bar serving bar food and a small coffee/cold counter serving take away stuff, that’s it. We had hoped to have a nice meal in the hotel and make the most of a night in a hotel before a flight out early the next day. In reality there just wasn’t the options for that to happen. We ended up walking round the corner ten minutes or the Marriott and eating there which I would highly recommend. Fabulous food and service. The bedroom on floor 8 and corridor also smelled of smoke. It clearly used to be a Smoking floor, just FYI. Room is also quite small, and bathroom tiny. Glad we were only;3
Living in the Midwest and travelling in January to Australia, I could not depend upon the weather so I decided to fly into LAX the day before I would be leaving at 11:00 p.m.  I needed a place to stay where I would not have to check out at 11:00 a.m.  I found the Four Points Sheraton which offered free shuttle to and from the airport and a rate to keep the room for up to 24 hours.   I was there for about 22 hours.  I appreciated this opportunity to rest before the very long flight.  The room was very average.  The lobby and pool were nice.  Any contact I had with employees--behind the desk, coffee bar, and restaurant was very positive.  If you are in a similar situation and do not want to spend hours and hours at the airport, I would recommend this property.  I had reservations;4
I was in LA for two days and I have no ideas about the hotel there so I chose the First good one comes to me in search  I have to say that is ok and good for a short period also the morning breakfast is good and diverse;4
If it weren’t for the location of this hotel I would’ve rated it even lower. The front desk staff was friendly, but the bellhop was super pushy and almost rude when directing us with our luggage and where we should unload our car and children. When we got to our room the bathtub was filthy. As it was late at night and our family was tired and needed to bathe after being out playing all day, we weren’t thrilled to say the least. My husband called the front desk and a manager came up to our room to help. She was friendly and helpful and offered us another room, which we took. It was another 20 min for our new room to be ready. The beds were hard and uncomfortable but fortunately for us (I guess?!) we only had about five hours to sleep before we had to get up and catch a flight.;2
I only gave this Sheraton 3 stars, because the hotel needs some updating. However we used it for a park and fly packages, because we needed a convenient place to stay the night before our flight to Miami and park our car for two weeks. The hotel was clean and staff was very courteous and helpful. Like I stated the hotel could stand some updating, but room was clean and they have 24 hrs. shuttle service to and from the airport. The Hilton wanted wat too much for their parking and the Marriot was did not accommodate 14 days. Yes I would use this hotel again for the convenience and great price and very frequent shuttle service.;3
Ok hotel close to the airport. Positives include quiet room and good gym. Negatives include expensive car parking and room was quite smelly, squashed and dated. Breakfast and bar were both good. Ok for an overnight stay.;3
I had a package delivered to me and was informed by the reception. When I came to the customer service, they told me to wait and I saw them shouting at some walk in guest who decided not to stay in this hotel. There are two girls also waiting to claim their luggage. After the shout, one staff said follow me with no further explanation and it turned out to be for those two girls. Finally when I’m ready to get my package and they could not find a record...... It took them quite some time to find the package and recreate a record. They were rude and made no apologies to for their negligence. Afterwards when we come downstairs to fetch the luggage from the car, they shouted at us and required us to move our car from the free parking slot to the non free ones. Luckily, we were going;1
came here by business purpose. This hotel is looks old. And the decoration also old. But they have nice ambiance. The staff was so helpfull, and the breakfast selection was so nice. The pool not to big.But its good because not to much people.;5
Second time staying at this hotel. I got a good online rate but had forgotten how egregiously expensive the guest parking is. At $29/night, it is truly a ripoff and at least $5 (if not more) expensive than comparable hotels. Hotels should not charge guests more than $10 for parking! Especially when there was plenty of parking available. Do what I did: I parked overnight in one of the nearby parking lots (like QuikPark or Joe's Airport Parking which were around $13/night). There is also the LAX Parking Lot C for $13 but it can get full. Its' about half a mile of a walk.  The room itself was fine, if a little stale of a smell. The toilet seemed in need of an upgrade but otherwise, no complaints about the room. Very nice hotel staff.  Some of the hotel needs some upgrading. For;3
Very nice hotel near LAX, clean spacious rooms and great bar with surprisingly good food. A good Greek restaurant nearby. Regular shuttle. Friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable lobby to hang out in, much preferred to waiting at the airport.;4
My husband and I stayed here in March of 2018 for 1 night. We only chose this hotel because of its proximity to LAX. We needed to be close to the airport since we had an early morning international flight. The hotel offers a free airport shuttle which is easy to catch and runs frequently. The rooms are very basic, outdated and not very clean. I would not stay here for multiple nights. 1 night was enough and served our purpose of convenience. I would only stay here again because of it's location being right near the airport.;3
Needs to be updated, the hotel needs a facelift. electrical tape holding the drain together, peeling paint. but nice pool and clean rooms, free shuttle to airport and lots of them. convenient to rental cars.;4
The room was a little outdated and had discoloured tile grout. The beds were comfy. The sheets were pristine. No USB outlets next to the bed which was irritating for international travellers charging phones. Had to use PowerPoint on the desk. The coffee shop in the lobby was great with very friendly staff. The front lobby was modern and well presented. The exterior of the hotel was outdated. The car parking was not included in room rate which was annoying. If I had to choose between this and the Renaissance next door I’d go next door after having stayed at both. Also no breakfast was provided with room rate as opposed to next door which has a great breakfast included.;3
They misrepresent and are unhelpful. Bad service.   I booked this hotel specifically because of the Your24 benefit to get an ‪8pm‬ late checkout.  After making a reservation I get a message telling me the form requesting the late checkout (that’s linked off that page) has been submitted on my behalf. I submit one myself anyway as to make sure the hotel knows I’m looking for the Your24 benefit and that I’m arriving at 11pm and leaving at 8pm.   After waiting in a long line to checkin, I’m told I have to leave at 4pm because of an AMA rate (which according to the online reservation system is a difference of $15). That’s not anywhere listed as a condition, but fine, I’ll pay the normal rate so I can check out at 8pm. I’m told no. It’s late, I’m tired after a day of traveling, and;1
Booked this room through parksleepfly.com. Do not use that service! The hotel did not have the information we provided. Book direct instead.   But not here - ever. I thought it might be nice because it’s a Sheraton. The room was dumpy and smelled like everyone before us smoked in it, despite a warning stating that a $200 cleaning fee would be imposed if you smoked in the room. They either pocket the money without cleaning the room or $200 is simply not enough to repair the damage.   As we walked to our room, a guest was walking a dog and the dog peed on the rug! The owner just shrugged her shoulders.   Finally, the cars are parked outside, unprotected from the elements.;1
We stayed one night, with 7 days parking with a park and fly rate. Room was small (but fine). Bathroom was definitely small and was hard to maneuver around in. Parking was great, shuttle was fine. It took 35 minutes in the morning for the shuttle to come but we were there super early because we're familiar with LAX hotel shuttles. At the airport we waited less than 10 minutes and then were on our way home.  Check in was quick and efficient, but we had no other dealings with other staff. I'd stay again if we can find a competitive rate for the park and fly.;3
While convenient due to LAX proximity, the hotel rooms are very small (the mini fridge was on the floor next to the furniture and the microwave was perched on top of it). The bathroom door didn't close. The shower water was barely warm. The windows let in all of the noise of the busy street below. And the bed sounded like it was going to fall apart. The carpet was dirty. Disappointing for the money paid.;3
This was the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at in Los Angeles. Let’s start with the $29/ Day parking which is ridiculous. The rooms are very small and gross. Paint coming off the walls, broken door handles, dirty closets.. this place is an over priced rip off.   I went in expecting a 4 Star Hotel and ended up paying for that, but getting a 2 Star motel... also, the staff was TERRIBLE.   I would NOT recommend staying at this hotel. The surrounding area has nicer options that are much more affordable and treat you like a guest rather than an inconvenience..;1
what to say about an airport hotel? You stay for a night and you move on. The shuttle works fine, the car rentals are all close by and the rooms are made for one-night stays. The breakfast is fine, but instead of spending 21 bucks on the buffet in the morning, order from the menu: it is cheaper and gives you better value for money: their omelets are pretty good made to order and much cheaper;3
I stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions. Each time the shuttle took a half hour to arrive and was incredibly crowded. Check in and out were easy. However, the rooms were both musty, and the lightsources were unpleasantly bright fluorescent. The shower temperature was difficult to control, and overall the room felt dingy. Service was friendly but incredibly slow. Also, on the second stay housekeeping stopped by at 8:30 am even though check out wasn't until 10 am. I will not stay here again. Other Sheratons are much better.;2
Compared to nearby hotels, this hotel is way overpriced and has several shortcomings in the service:  - The shuttle for the hotel comes less frequently than other shuttles and more than once it passed my terminal without stopping. - When I arrived in my room there were no bottle of water and no large towels.  - When I asked for large towels that were missing in my room it took them more than 30 minutes and two phone calls to bring them.  - The premium internet would not connect and when I called they said they would have to connect me to some other provider.  - The breakfast service took them forever to seat us, and the poor service personnel is way understaffed.  - The rooms and bathrooms are old looking  - The elevators take forever to arrive  Overall a poor experience;3
Never stay here!!  Shuttle takes so long it’s packed.  Check in is a disaster. Slow.  Rooms are ok but 15 Years overdue for Reno.  Windows are thin and it’s so so so noisy.  Barely any blankets on beds so cold at night.  Will never return.;2
Made reservation for Jr Suite.  Was shuttled around to five rooms, running all over the halls with luggage.  First Jr Suite, reeked of smoke. Second, Jr Suite but kicked out as soon as we got our luggage in the room.  Probably saving for another guest. Third, downgraded to double room.  Hey, give me at least a king size bed! Fourth, King Size but air conditioner did not work,  Fifth, finally a King size bed in tiny tiny room.   Manager simple said ... too bad and offered no other choice.  That night way over booked with many customers yelling, screaming, storming out.   No restaurant open, just bar food.  Manager said ... after all we are not a full service hotel.   That's his excuse.  We checked into the wrong Sheraton and it was all our fault.   If you want a real Sheraton go;2
We waited 45 mins for the shuttle. The diver was extremely aggressive and threatened us when we complaint.  He insulted my family for no reason.  We did not feel safe.  This service is unacceptable.  That person should not be working with customers.  This reflects very poor management by Sheraton.;1
We waited 40 mins for the shuttle and called the hotel 3 times. They have no way to contact the shuttle and left us stranded. The shuttles for the A Loft, Homewood, quality inn, and Marriott come by every 5 mins with multiple cans. I would never stay here again.;1
I stayed here recently for a business trip to LA. I had to book travel through my employers travel website. So as a SPG Gold Member I was not fully aware of the type of room I would get, we had more than one in our party. I had to call FOUR Time before I was able to actually speak with someone at the front desk. When I finally reached the front desk, I spoke with Johnny and he was very helpful. He informed me I had a room reserved with 2 queen beds and it included breakfast. Great news! On the evening of my check in, I walked into the lobby and there was only ONE front desk employee working. There was FOUR stations for check in, but only ONE currently manned. Approximately 13 parties inline to check in, shortly after I got in line another patron walked in yelling out expletives;3
Well appointed room, very clean, everything worked. Check in was fantastic. Great staff. Close to everything. Would definitely stay again, good rewards offer, program. Better value than surrounding properties.;4
Positive review: Good frequent shuttle service close to airport whether you choose to take the shuttle or walk. Nice restaurant, pool and exercise room on premises, Friendly and helpful staff. Good value for the money. Renovations planned and in progress. Negative review: Somewhat expensive parking with small parking stalls. No microwave ovens in rooms. Smell of marijuana can be strong in the evenings. Remote control for TV difficult to navigate quickly or easily.;3
The hotel location is very nice in Lax airport area They have a very good and active shuttle service that is going around the clock between the hotel and the airport  The staff are friendly and helpful  Food is good Rooms are nice and comfortable will equipped with good WiFi service;4
I’m very disappointed in the way the hotel handled an item that I forgot in my room.  I stayed from the 15th Till the 16th room 265. I forgot an iphone case charger and it’s charger. I called in the hotel and spoke to the director of house keeping and he promised to investigate and call back me which he never did. I Called again and was transferred to the director of operations and she didn’t answer so I left a voice mail and till now no response. This is not acceptable from a respectful chain like yours and my next step is to reach out to the HQ of four points directly.;1
Definitely aware of its age but very clean and had a great stay in the east tower. did peak the west tower which looked very dated. The king bed was comfy and the washroom was small but also very clean.;5
Had a great experience here. Check in was easy, they gave us some options for rooms even though we had a reservation. No issues with loud neighbors and the housekeeping was super nice and thorough. Unfortunately weather didn't let us try the pool or anything.  Location was perfect - shuttle was often and nice drivers.;4
"The room , prepaid and sold through a web site had the heating / AC not functioning ( thermostat unit not functioning( diagnosis of the maintenance operator who intervened  immediately. The unit was a simple plug in probably common to all rooms but the hotel had no spares External temperature 11 C it was really hard to stay in the room . Not possible to have a shower. The general condition of the hotel is not reflecting a brand like Sheraton although with an ""entry level sub brand "" like four Point. The hotel should be refurbished completely. Bathroom are old and not well kept, The room has a bad smell even if apparently clean .The hotel manager on duty offered additional blankets because they do not have portable electric heathers ( 20 € value in Europe). Never ever reserve for";1
Its a old hotel, but its very good. Good room space, free wifi and free water on room. The parking its expensive $29 per day. The shuttle from airport its free and fast. Just the A/C its old and make a little noise.;4
Upon entering this hotel I WAS very impressed, the Lobby looked very nice but that all went down hill. DO NOT BE FOOLED!!! Once I got in line there was only one person at the front checking people in, if you are prepared to wait in a line like the ones they have in vegas (not exaggerating) then go ahead and stay here it will only take you about an hour of your time to check in and make it to your room with there complicated check in system. That was just the start of it. When I finally made it to my room I was definitely underwhelmed, Old TV, the restroom is very cramped and there is TERRIBLE lighting. If you want your makeup to look on fleek this is not the place. Haha, I am not exaggerating when I say that the motel 6 in inglewood rooms are better, they just do not have the;2
i do not fell verry inspired today so i will keep it short. i was verry pleased with the experience. it is close to the airport, of course, big room, clean, great value, clean bathroom ( no slippers though).  after a wild search for a good hotel in LA ( i did not knew the area ) it was the best option and i was happy with mu choice. Parking not included in the room fee ! i recomend!;4
A good hotel with a nice restaurant with good food, great location with only a short drive, the rooms are spacious with good comfy beds, the staff is courteous and pleasant and the shuttle service is good.;5
Had an early flight out so I stayed here the night before. Convenient to LAX, the parking was easy and the room was pretty nice. The room was comfortable for the little time I was there and the bathroom was clean and well appointed. Lots of people stay there so I had to wait to check in and wait for the elevator, but not unacceptably long by any means.;4
Hotel shuttle from the airport was quick, and a quick check in.  The rooms was good for a Four Points Hotel.  Even that we could see planes coming in we didn't hear them.  It is in a good location as we got in late at night and the next morning we just walked across the street to Budget and picked up our car;4
We had arrived at the hotel a bit earlier and we were told that the room was not ready. That was fine as we had a car and were able to store our luggage there. We were not offered the chance to leave the luggage with the hotel. We were told the room would be ready in three hours, so we returned four hours later.   My first impression of the room was dirty and uncleaned. There was a pile of used tissues left on the bathroom counter.There were stains left on the toilet, that we washed away ourselves. There were a couple of dried and chunky stains on the carpet. These stains looked like dried vomit. The room looked like it was never cleaned, despite our waiting for it.   When we showered, the bathroom drain was plugged and water pooled at our feet. It was not very pleasant. I had;2
We stay here for the weekend!! Bedroom was very clean,totally comfortable king size bed they offer breakfast,you have to pay parking it run from $10 to $29 at night  Service people are very friendly I highly recommended this hotel it’s not too price at all!! Really close to airport.;5
I have had multiple visits to this property hoping it would be good and each time to be let down. I have had many times that my HVAC did not work and they did nothing to fix it. My WiFi yeah you can forget all about that you won’t get connection at all. This place needs to be fixed.;1
Hotel was clean we stayed 2 nights, very small room for family of four. Beautiful lobby and waiting area. Price resonable.   We asked for good view and the receptionist said we have a good view but when we got to the room it was facing the parking Lot,...  Rated 3 star to receptionist over all hotel 4 star.;3
Booked a room for 3 nights . As we were flying in at 6am we paid the extra night so our room would be available when we arrived . We struck Juan on the front desk we informed me that we were listed as a no show . Tried to explain we had already paid for the night but he advised we should have rung them. I produced our booking confirmation which stated our arrival time but he said we should have rung them . He found me a room which was  like a motel with an outside walkway. Traffic going past regularly and dingy. I guess he won the argument. The concierge staff were great arranging tours etc . Overall not a hotel I would ever use again;2
Like the other reviewer noted, I had a room with no window to the outside. Just a hallway window. I am a nurse at a large urban hospital. I travel all over, alone at times. I've never been as sketched out as getting to room down this dimly lit hallway. So odd for a Sheraton brand, and highly rated hotel. Not worth what I paid. With the lobby as nice as it is it's like a bait and switch. My favorite were the men talking on their cellphones in the hallway outside my room til 1am. Don't stay here there are better places for the $. Water bottles in room were nice and shuttle worked out for me.;2
I've stayed here before and the room was adequate for an airport hotel. Checked in tonight and was given a little interior room with no window, just a fake window,that is a window to the interior hall.   Room small, little bitty tv, is motel 6 like.  It would be one thing if they gave you a cut rate for this cut rate room but it's the same price as the others.  I travel a lot for business and this is WAY below standard.  I'd rather be at a Holliday inn, anywhere.  I will not be returning.  Beat up furniture like they got it at a second hand store.;1
I can tell you the rooms are updated and considered very clean. I rate the bed a 9 for comfort. The bathroom although small was updated and clean as well. The property is gated and very safe. plenty of parking. Breakfast was very good with option to get omelet in the buffet. Unless you get the breakfast included in your rate you will be shocked to get a $20 charge for breakfast buffet.  Main issue for us was the booking agent included parking in our rate, but when I checked in they said it was $8 per day. Now that is not a huge fee, as I have had much worse up to $50 day, but when you book it as included and then they change it when you check in, I do not like the way they treated me or the management. I will not ever stay there again...So make sure you have your confirmation;3
I stayed there last night and it was not great. I had a room with 2 queens and the one I chose had bottom sheet that only covered 1/2 the mattress and the mattress pad was old and too small too. Very creepy. Luckily the other bed was fine. I asked for a 5:45 wake up call which never happened. The shade on the bedside lamp was half off because it was missing a screw. the place is a little run down. The staff were very nice and the shuttle was prompt.;3
I have stayed many times at the Four Points by Sheraton at LAX. The staff is great. This hotel needs to get into the 21st Century. They had one elevator out of commission and the other two groaned and jerked a plenty. There were signs all over telling of changes to come...in September..and this was January. It is tired and it's rooms need to reflect the needs of its guests. My room had many signs of wear and frankly, neglect. It feels like it was planned a long time ago when our electronic needs were not what they are now. There are way too few outlets especially across the room from the bedside. The AC was not adjustable. The pillows and bedding are just average. The staff is great but they deserve a hotel that reflects their wonderful hospitality...and currently, it's not Four;3
Nice place and a very pleasant employees, nice size refrigerator and microwave USB hook up next to the bed for all of your electronics, shower water pressure is amazing.   No pay channels that comes standard with most hotels, like HBO, SHOWTIME,  ETC... however very small TV, the free internet is too slow and keep on disconnecting.  Continental breakfast Just had breakfast it good, not the rubbery looking stuff you get in some hotels, like the egg suffered of depression before the made into scramble, however it wasn't the best breakfast I've ever had but it was good quality.  The Seventh floor elevator button to go downstairs to the lobby is broken so I had to push up first and if somebody in there you have to go up first then go back down, if nobody in it you can just go back;3
We just needed to spend a night somewhere close to the airport. This hotel was just fine. Shuttle from/to the airport is coming every 20 minutes, quick check in, comfortable beds, complimentary coffe and tea in your room... Ok for one night stay.;3
This hotel's rooms are clean and nice. It has a restaurant that looked good though we didn't partake. Only a mile away from LAX, this hotel has a shuttle running 24/7 every 20 minutes to and from the airport. A very convenient and nicely appointed hotel when flying in and out of LAX.;3
Needed a room for last night stay in LA.  Very cheap rate at $125 before tax.  Room was adequate, nothing wrong w it.    Con: 2 out of 3 elevators were not working  Pro: Nice bar and lounge area. kids enjoyed the pool off the lounge   Tip: for the penny pincher U can forego valet parking ($49) by parking down side street (W 96th St). That street is located one hotel over next to Renaissance. Just be careful. It is an industrial street that after dark seems shady. However I survived 2 nights parking there.  Also Starbucks is within walking distance around the corner at the Marriott.  Overall I would definitely stay there for quick stay while waiting for a flight in or out.;3
I stayed here for a night recently. I arrived mid-afternoon and was quickly checked-in. Being SPG Platinum it was nice to be recognized and allocated an over-sized room on a high floor.  The hotel is getting a little dated now and it shows in the design, particularly the tight bathroom that was common to most hotels built in the same era. Nevertheless everything in the room was clean and worked and there are elements where the technology reflects current standards. The wifi was strong and stable.  I ordered room service and was pleased with the salad, steak sandwich and key lime pie that arrived. Next morning breakfast was the usual standard fare although the service staff did seem a little more switched on. I was left in no doubt they were keen to assist.  All in all a good;3
I can't actually say what the rooms were like, as I never actually got checked in.  After making a reservation on the SPG website over a week before my intended stay, and after selecting a check-in time of 11 p.m. (and a check-out time of 7 a.m.), when I arrived at the hotel around 12:30 that night, due to a delayed flight, the front desk operator informed me they didn't have a room for me.  He went back to speak with his hotel manager, wasting an additional 15-20 minutes of my time, before coming back out to say they were working on finding a room for me.  The two good things to come out of the situation: I made sure they did not charge me for a room I never used, and they did lend me a couple towels so I could wash my face and get a little cleaned up before heading back to the;1
Four Points is a basic airport hotel with OK rooms, but surprisingly slow operations.Check-in was slow, dinner was particularly slow, and breakfast exceedingly slow... And: that slowness is NOT a merit for a Sheraton!;3
Nice front desk staff with customer service, location near airport with shuttle to terminal, no pet fee. Being in LA which you kinna have to drive everywhere with $26 parking fee is a bit high for where the hotel located (not in city center). Other than restaurant in the hotel, no other walking distance food outlet location.;3
"My boyfriend and I stayed here the night before an early flight from LAX, looking forward to a relaxing night in what looked like a great hotel. The only positives: convenient location with a free airport shuttle and a nice lobby area. Otherwise, it turned out to be a very disappointing stay.  We arrived at our room to find the window wide open with no screen; I went to close it and close the curtains and they fell off of the track. The room was extremely small- you could barely wheel your suitcase in between the bed and dresser. The bathroom door didn’t shut all the way and didn’t latch, the toilet was constantly running or sounding like it was going to clog when flushed, there was no mini fridge, and worst of all, the bed was broken. As in, sounded like the frame was cracked";1
"The good: Great customer service. Location and regular free shuttle to LAX. Great pool area and atrium area. The bar with good food and drinks that is open long hours; the cafe with good variety of healthy foods. The newer rehab-ed rooms. The not so good - lazy porters who make you walk to retrieve your stored luggage and make you (6o+) reach and lift your cases down from height and walk them back to the lobby while expecting a tip. A real contrast to the porter who delivered bags to my room and collected for storage. The reception desk needs extra staff as the wait can be long though they give great attention to each and every guest. Overall: a good price for a convenient location with good facilities. Tip: do upgrade for a nominal fee to the newly refurbished rooms - makes a";4
We stayed one might on our way to NZ. Comfortable room, lovely heated outdoor pool, adequate for laps, near LAX. They allowed for a bit later checkout due to our late flight out. Will stay here again when at LAX.;4
Close to LAX, quick, friendly service, bar and restaurant, however, the hotel itself is old and tired. The rooms need serious work. The price was in-line with that though, which makes it a decent deal.;2
This was just to be close to airport. The accommodations were alright. The pillows were just ok. The view outside my window was nice. The room size would of been enough had my 3 kids & husband traveled with me. The hotel does offer free airport shuttle.;4
An SPG member we got a dark room with window to an inside walkway. Like a tomb. we asked for something else as we are not vampires. Got a room with view of an metal staircase (220) I will call this a 2,5 star hotel with a motel  feel. Have stayed here i 1989, 2010 and now. Will avoid in future;3
We wanted something nice and central, with easy access to many places. This is close to airport, 30 minutes from Disneyland, and good distance to Manhattan City, Venice beaches.  Staff very nice. Our room was a small King, but I think they have larger Kings as well. It was tight for my husband, toddler, and I. We didn't spend much time in room, so it was ok.   Great Value. Walking distance to mall. Parking 22 dollars per night.;4
I thought this looked like a very nice place judging from the pictures. It was definitely a great location being right near the airport since I would only be here for one night and fly out from lax the next day. But I arrived and immediately had a bad feeling just walking in the lobby. Once I reached the hallway to my room I knew I had make a horrible decision. Entering the hotel room I felt like I was in a hotel room that had not been updated since the early 1980's. So unbelievably run down and dirty looking. Throughout the night I heard a couple fighting and screaming and slamming doors in the next room. Those walls are paper thin. The staff was nice and accommodating but this place is just a dump and my worst nightmare in the form of a hotel. I'm very unhappy and wish I never;1
We were there for one night and it was fine. Room was nothing special but clean and comfortable. Parking wasn’t great (not covered) and $29/night. A buffet breakfast is offered at $18 which I found expensive for what you got. Ordering off the menu might be a better option. It’s very convenient to the airport - just 5 minutes away - and that’s why we stayed there.;3
Since my regular LAX was booked, I wanted to try this place again since the fixes to raise the bar from my previous stay were relatively easy. Check in was excellent with LT. Breakfast was superb. But the parking was actually worse than before, too many long term, not enough spaces, and there were some other problems (handled satisfactorily by the morning manager).;3
This place works for an overnight stay in close proximity to the airport.  It’s not quite as nice as the brand name suggests, but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean.  Staff were friendly.  The room was a little small, but fine.  The shuttle was reliable. It runs every 20-30 minutes without a fixed schedule.  Priceline advertised our $108 (inc. tax) rate as a substantial discount.  I wouldn’t pay too much more than this to stay at this hotel.;4
This hotel is far below the standard that I expect from a SPG property. It is poorly maintained, dirty, and unsafe.   On January 11, 2018, my husband and I missed our connecting flight from LA to Sydney because our flight from Houston was delayed by three hours. The next available flight from LA to Sydney was at 10:45pm the following night. United gave us vouchers for two nights at the Four Points so we could check out late. We checked into the hotel sometime after 2 am but checked out around 2 hours later after getting stuck in the elevator.  When we arrived at the Four Points, there was no desk agent in sight and it was unclear where we needed to go for check-in. A security guard saw that we looked confused so she helped us to find the agent. We were given a key card and we;1
I stayed for two nights for a meeting held at the hotel. After seeing the location and assessing the food options, I wish I had booked something in Santa Monica. If you're staying here for a quick overnight to catch a flight, it's a reasonable option. Otherwise, choose something else. The staff is friendly, the beds are ok, the rooms a decent size--all just average, nothing special. The biggest downside is that there are very few decent food options available close by. Another negative, especially for single female travelers, is that the parking lot is dark and behind the building. If you're coming back to the hotel later, beware of that. If I needed to stay by the airport, this is a valid option. Other than that, I'd choose differently.;3
I usually stay at the LAX Westin, but the price was too high for the night.  I took a chance on this property.  Here are my observations:  Good * Price at $120 was ok * s\Staff seemed attentive * Great feather pillows * Rooms have been somewhat updated with newer carpet and furnishings * Good shuttle to airport  Bad * They cut corners in the bathroom renovations * Missing trim along the windows * Bathrooms didn't feel clean  * Breakfast buffet is so-so at best  Lower your expectations, and you will be ok.;3
I stayed here for a night in December '17 and I found that it was reasonably OK. It is close to the airport and the biggest advantage is the complimentary shuttle that they have. I reached LAX after a very long intercontinental flight and I was happy that I was able to reach the hotel immediately. The hotel service was good.   As someone has already pointed out, there is Burger King right opposite to this hotel and I went there to grab a quick bite for the night. The rooms were not that big as compared to some of the other Four Points that I have stayed before.  The hotel also has a restaurant within in case you want to eat within the property itself.  Nice property for a quick stay.;4
Stayed here at airline expense because of missing a connection.  Picked this over the option of a Hilton, since I am a Gold Member with SPG and Marriott.  Was told I was upgraded as a Gold member, but doesn't seem like a room upgrade.     - Windows are very cheap, letting both air and sound in when closed - after working had as closing as far as possible.  - Very few outlets and what I could find are actually extension cords running around behind furniture.  Only way to plug in something bedside is to unplug something else.  - Room has a refrigerator, but it has a three-prong grounded plug with no outlet in reach of cord - only an extension cord with two-prong receptacles.    - Coffee maker is in room, but has to be taken to the bathroom to plug in. - To plug in laptop at desk I;3
Will definitely stay here again!! Friendly , clean,  great restaurant and bar!  Room was spacious and clean .  The shuttle service to and from the airport was a little slow. Great location from the airport.;5
Four Points Sheraton is a very convenient for families or business people connecting through LAX. Less than ten minute shuttle ride from airport. Helpful staff, good service. Pool, gym. All you’d expect from Sheraton.;4
Stayed here 2 separate nights as LA stopovers to be near airport.  Very nice rooms and adequate facilities.  Enjoyed the Brewsters Beererie bar & food a lot, hit the spot nicely for this tired traveller.  Recommend this hotel for comfort, value and convenience for close by LAX.  Free shuttle bus to & from as well.;4
I only visited the hotel for an event but did not stay in the rooms. The conference room was large and comfortably accommodated all in attendance.  There was valet parking at a rate of $43 for the night or self-park at $29 or $12 with event validation.  There was a small cafe in the lobby with coffee, tea and sweets. Next to that was a bar and restaurant. I ordered coffee and a muffin from the cafe and because of the event, there was quite a line and wait. There were 3 workers manning the cafe but seemed very unorganized.  I got a glimpse of the pool which looked amazing.  There were two restrooms I found on the main floor. One was completely out of toilet paper. The other was clean and well-maintained.;3
My 70 year old mother and I stayed at this hotel because she had an international flight out of LAX at 5am. We were in the room less than 12 hours. The room was perfectly fine and the bed was comfortable but the service was a HUGE problem.  I dropped off my mother at the airport at 2:45 am and was going to take the hotel shuttle back to the hotel to sleep before heading back home. I called the hotel to pick me up and waited 20 minutes. Nothing. I called the hotel again and they said it was on the way. Another 20 minutes goes by and the shuttle arrives to drop people off. I get in the shuttle and the driver takes off then drives right by the hotel and stops at a check cashing spot about two miles from the hotel. I asked her what was going on and if we were going back to the hotel;2
The hotel is close to the Los Angeles International Airport and has a shuttle service to each terminal.  It's a budget style hotel that has some conference facilities and 2 restaurants.  The food was good and although our stay was short it was pleasant.;4
Stayed just 1 night on our way to Asia. Quick check in/out. We barely used the facilities of the hotel to have any negative or positive remarks.  The A/C in the room is old and very noisy that's the only remark, everything else was fine.;4
We stayed at this hotel for a few hours until our flight was ready to depart. Lobby is modern and clean. Staff are friendly. Rooms are terrible. Out of date, dirty, single glazed windows.   I would recommend you stay somewhere else.;2
This hotel is old and dirty. Very noisy. In the middle of the night I woke up with doors slamming... the room is very small. You can hear the other room guests. The only thing good is staff, very kind.;2
We used this hotel as a transit hotel for just 1 night. Ideal as they have a 24 hour pick up and return to all LA terminals. Our room was big with a king bed. Room had a safe and large TV. We had spent all day on a plane being shovel fed so only dined in the bar. We didn't have breakfast the next day so little can be said about food quality. Bed was very comfortable. Only issue we found is their express need to get the bill paid on your credit card irrespective that I told them the holding card was NOT the card I would be using to settle the room. Seems this was not understood but in fairness they seem to have fixed this - until I check my credit card statement. In reality this is not a bad place to stay. Close to airport and comfortable.  Free wifi makes it even better b;4
We traveled from New Zealand and our flight was early morning arrival.  Reception understood we were tired and arrange for our room to be services.  We didn’t wait long and had an lovely early check in.   Reception was fantastic, staff friendly and our room was clean and comfortable. Will definitely stay with them again when the opportunity comes up to visit the USA.;5
Stayed at hotel for four days as part of attending the Tournament of Roses parade. Close to the airport but did not notice jet noise most of the time. A little outdated but the staff more than made up for it. Every staff member that we interacted with was friendly and more than helpful. Did miss having a refrigerator or microwave that seems to be standard in most hotels. Will stay there again next time we visit Los Angeles.;4
Booked this hotel through SPG ( Starwood preferred guest) programme as a member on our last  day in the west coast..  I did not know what to expect as had not stayed at Four Points before. However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Reception staff was really helpful, there was a minor system glitch but he upgraded us by a notch, it is a shame we arrived so late ( just before midnight)  The hotel is reasonable old but rooms are very clean, up to date and have tea coffee facilities. Bathrooms are practical, clean and have everything you need.  In the morning of our check out I discovered that it even had a pool, had I known it was open, I would have used it as it look great. anyway we sat by the pool had lunch was a nice sunny day. The pool looked very clean.  The gym is well equipped.;4
Can’t fault this hotel staff are so kind first time in Los Angeles & we where a bit unsure if we picked the right area to stop over, we only here for two nights so we didn’t want to venture to far away from Airport. Hotel is very comfortable beds are lovely & comfortable. Great sleep but you do hear the planes at times. But it didn’t bother us I liked watching them from our room window. Food here good nice coffee & snack bar also. Housekeeping very good standard.We went on a VIP tour we used the concierge desk in reception highly recommend this tour as it got us to lots of places we wouldn’t have seen it was very interesting. And a nice day out;4
The staying is very pleasant. Mr Cesar Lopez has been immensely helpful and graceful during our stay here at Four Points. Cesar treated us with not only hospitality but also made the entire experience as wonderful as he could. It is my wish that the customer service department knows how amazing of a job he did.  His customer-centric experience deeply impressed me and my family.  Thank you and we will definitely come back for more vacation fun.  Jing;5
I love the stay, people were amazing. Great for business trips as I travel a lot for. Thanks be back soon. Some things did not work well, but for a quick day for business, and very close to the airport i just had to give it a good review.;4
First time that i have ever stayed at this hotel.  It certainly will not be the last !  The hotel was spotless, the service was impeccable and the rooms were very much up to date.   Everyone knows how busy LAX is and that flights leave at the oddest of hours.  Don't worry, the hotel offers a free shuttle that leaves every 20 minutes, 24 hours per day.   You will not regret staying here.  I didn't......and i will go back again !;5
I would have given this four or five stars as my stay was nice and pleasant and aside from the slow check in it went well... Until after my I woke up I realised several of the pillowcases had old marks from lipstick and blood on them. This made me uneasy and I question the hygiene and cleanliness of the establishment. If you want clean sheets I'd recommend staying somewhere else.;2
Staff is friendly.  Went above and beyond expectation. Checked in late and had late check out.  Our heater in the room did not work.  They called for some one to look at it.  It could not be fixed so they gave us another room.  Ferdinand was extremely helpful and helped us move to the other room.  Breakfast was included and the staff went above and beyond to please. The pool was heated to 85 degrees. It was only cold when you got out. Bathroom is tile and a little slippery when wet, so put a towel on the floor.;5
Check-in took very long. Hotel is in major need of a renovation. Housekeeping could do a much better job. I would never stay here again.  Run down and totally out of date.  I can't believe this is a Sheraton hotel.;2
I arrived with trepidation after reading the reviews here and elsewhere. Yes, this is not a new property. However, my room was nice, fairly quiet (considering the proximity to LAX), the food was good, service was excellent, and prices reasonable. I had little wait for the airport shuttle. I took the #3 Big Blue Bus to Santa Monica on the way home (the stop for this and the Culver City Bus are just to the south of the property). I walked to a nearby mini mart for dinner snacks. The free WiFi was fine. The catered food at my event was excellent. A few issues (new batteries needed in TV remote) were rectified quickly. One elevator was down for maintenance and the other 2 seemed they might be headed that way. Would stay here again.;4
Neat and clean rooms, also very warm staff! Couldn’t love it more. Extremely recommended. Shuttles to and from the airport were very helpful in my case. Would definitely come back whenever I visit LA again.;4
We arrived very late into LAX & was greeted by a wonderful, friendly shuttle driver. I regret that I don’t remember her name, but I’d like to give her a nice shout out as she packed our shuttle with weary travelers, yet maintaining her friendly, vivacious demeanor! Thank you Four Points Sheraton!;5
Only stayed one night as we had a long layover, and it was more than enough...dont let the sheraton name fool you, it wasnt anything like the sheratons that we've previously stayed...lobby looked nice but beyond that it was in need of refurbishment.  The hotel had a strange and confusing layout and the rooms which were accessed from an interior walkway, appeared as though the walkway had once been open air, but had been closed in, as the hotel room window overlooked the hallway. The beds were creaky and sunk a bit when climbing in, yet wasnt really soft. While the bathroom features where nicely decorated, they were dated, and the paper thin walls needed good sound proofing as we were awoken by a noisy group of people two doors down reenacting a police raid.;2
We had to stay in LA for one night on our way south and the Sheraton fit the bill because its proximity to the airport and the fact that it is dog friendly. The hotel is nothing fancy but it is decent enough and has a very friendly staff and a good restaurant. Our room was large enough to not feel crowded with our doggies. Clean enough and quieter than what we imagined.  If in need, we would stay here again.;4
Got a great deal on Hotel Tonight. Room was clean but not so quiet. Lot of outside traffic and plane noise.I turned the fan on high which helped a bit. Comfortable bed, very friendly staff. Big pool. Airport shuttle runs often.;3
Was unfortunate enough to be stranded overnight in LA.  Hotel lobby looks nice enough, but rooms are total piece of $&!@ and that's saying a lot given I'm an SPG gold member.  Room was old and dingy and desperately in need of a remodel. Bathroom was ok until you looked up and saw the mildew fighting its way back through the paint that was used to try to cover it up.  Shower head and shower fixtures were well beyond their life as well.    As I was preparing to go to sleep, I noticed that one of the queen beds (might have been a full, not sure) had a couple of black ants crawling around under the sheets.  Switched to the other queen bed as I didn't want to be rude to my guests.  Thought about complaining and asking to be switched to another room, but it was late and I was tired;1
worst experience of how dirty the blanket was. It looked clean when there is no sunlight but when the sunlight came through my window and I lifted my blanket inside you can see the dirty stains inside my blanket. This was  Absolutely disgusting  I couldn't believe it.;1
Nothing all that glamorous, especially not for the price. The place works well for a quick layover at LAX.  Service was friendly and rooms were clean. For SPG members that have status staying here isn't the greatest. There are other properties that can likely provide upgrades. This property also appears to be popular for conventions so something to keep in mind if you want to avoid crowds.;3
I was well received at the front desk. When i told them my room location was noisy they did not hesitate to move me. Unfortunately the second room was still very noisy from car alarms, truck back up alerts, sirens, traffic etc.  The hotel food was good.;3
Flew in late and just needed a close hotel for a few hours.  This was perfect.   Nothing special but clean, big room, great staff and 5 minute shuttle from airport.  Can’t go wrong do a airport hotel.   Will be back when i need a hotel close to LAX;3
"Spent an overnight stay here as a senior couple. Loved the cleanliness, bath amenities, luxurious towels, comfortable room, and free Wi-Fi. Quick check-in, but slow check-out. Buffet breakfast was good, but limited; lesser starred hotels offer the same, if not, more variety. Suggestion: add veggies to the variety of breakfast buffet.";4
帰国前に空港に行きやすいホテルを探し、予約しました。 空港からはシャトルバスが出ており、アクセスは便利です。 部屋も綺麗でバスルームも清潔で快適でした。 しかし、チェックインの際にありえないミスをされました。 部屋をアサインしてもらい、カードキーを二枚発行してもらい、封筒には二階の部屋番号が書いてありました。この時点で一度ルームナンバーの記載を間違えられてます。 カードキーの封筒に書いてある部屋番号はエレベーターから遠く、スーツケースを二つ引きずりやっと到着したものの、カードキーが使えず部屋はあかず。なんどやってもエラーなのと、ロビーまで行くには遠いのでフロントに携帯から電話したところ、部屋番号が違うとのこと。2階ではなく、7階と。 汚い字で読み違えたか？と思うも、ルームキーの封筒には一度書き間違えた7の数字があり、確実に2階の部屋番号を書いてある。一度書き間違えられた部屋にもカードキーを使うも入れず。 新しい部屋番号を聞いたので、仕方なくもう一度荷物を引きずり、エレベーターまで歩き７階へ。 ここもエレベーターから1番遠い端の部屋。やっと到着し、カードキーを入れるとまたエラー。二枚とも使えない。仕方ないのでフロントにもう一度電話し、事情を説明するとセキュリティが部屋を開けてくれるとのこと。 部屋番号はあっているらしい。 カードキーは一切使えず。仕方ないのでフロントへ行き、事情を説明。 今まで世界各地、いろんなホテルに泊まりましたがこんなこと一度もありません。 チェックインのスタッフは何をしたのでしょうか。部屋をアサインしても、間違った部屋番号を書き、カードキーも使えないなんてまったく仕事をしてないのではないか。;1
I booked a king room online but received a room with 2 twin beds. Since I checked in at 2am I didn't have the strength to drag myself down and settled for what I got. If I asked for something once I never got it. Toiletries, getting stuff fixed, everything needs to be followed up on. Finally they gave me a room that controls the air of the hallway so I can't increase the heat in the room. Did I mention the service was terrible. Avoid this hotel!;2
I stayed at this location last night. While it was very clean, it really needs a face lift. The room felt very stale and the carpet needed to be refreshed. The bathroom reminded me of the 1990s. There is absolutely no decor in the room. While the lobby looks contemporary and modern the rooms felt old and stale. They were really small. I felt clostrophobic. I was disappointed as I am a loyal SPG member and I can typically rely on this brand to exceed my expectations. I will commend the bar. The bartender did an excellent job customizing a fresh berry martini according to my specifications. The bar was excellent and made my night more tolerable. It is a great airport location for anyone with an early morning flight.;2
Recommend staying here because of location, accommodation, cleanliness of rooms and nice bed!))) I was here for one night stay and will be back again if have a chance.   The only thing I did not like tv on demand that you have to pay for.;4
The shuttle bus picked me up from LAX the driver was very friendly. The property is a very short ride from the airport 10-15 minutes depending on which gate you are at and traffic.  When I got to the property I was very impressed. Check-in was supper fast and the receptionist was really helpful. The lobby area is gorgeous and they have multiple bars.  The room had a great view (for a airport hotel) If you like watching planes land you will love it. The room and halls smelled nice. The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was very modern.  The room had a coffee machine, fridge, and safe. The bed was very comfortable and quiet. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud (in the good way)  I went to the restaurant which had an all you can eat buffet for $20. I could't believe it.;4
Stay here ONLY if you love 1. Waiting in line forever. 2. Extremely incompetent staff and management. 3. Staying up all night with a noisy air conditioner. 4. Shabby and smelly rooms at Sheraton prices. DO stay here if you hate: Yourself. We booked here because we had an early flight and wanted to park our car during our trip. Check-in took 30 minutes waiting in a line of two other people. The front desk is actually a stand in a food court, with two agents who randomly disappear. The room was appalling, especially for a Sheraton. We shrugged it off, since we were just there for one night's sleep. Not so much. The bed was actually a very uncomfortable trampoline. The air conditioner seemed have given itself a cold, as it wheezed and shuddered all night. The worst feature of the;1
Quick check in and check out. Friendly staff. 5 minutes from LAX airport. Their restaurant takes dinner orders till 12 am so there is something to eat if you check in late. Rooms were as advertised, clean and spacious. Paid overnight parking is available.;4
We stayed here one night before our flight back home. Loved the proximity to the airport and free shuttle service. They had guest appreciation night with free beer samples and snacks, which was AMAZING.   The only thing I was not a huge fan of, was the elevators were undergoing maintenance, so the wait times were almost painful. They put out muffins, coffee and tea at the elevator entrance to apologize for the long wait times. This was a nice and courteous gesture.   Overall, this hotel is clean, comfortable, and a great place to rest before or after your flights. Would stay here again.;5
Arriving at LAX I had no problem finding the shuttle bus to the Hotel. Check in was a breeze and I was soon on my way to my room on the 6th floor, ( Room 642 ) The room that I had allocated was down what I can only describe as an internal motel style corridor, not what I was expecting, if you did not pull the blinds down, anyone walking past your room could easily look into your room. Room was dark and did not smell that fresh. Carpet had seen too many feet, bed was comfortable, shower facilities, old and not very appealing. Since this was just an overnighter I was just looking for somewhere to sleep after a 12 hour transatlantic flight. If it was an extended stay I would have asked for another room. Breakfast way overpriced for a buffet $ 23 without tax and tip. No problems;3
"Comfortable room and bed, quiet at night, great shower, pleasant staff.  Best of all was the casual restaurant, ""Comfort"" with simple, tasty, reasonably priced food.  We had soup and salads plus carmelized Brussel sprouts.";5
Conveniently located near the airport with shuttle buses. It is also walking distance to a Burger King and Carl's Jr. This hotel has a nice facade from the outside. However, there are different classes of rooms. I booked through Expedia sale not knowing that our room was at the back section with motel style corridors. When mentioning to hotel personnel, I was told that to avoid being in those rooms have to look for deluxe rooms.;3
There were nice people working here - they were just always out of position.  I got to the front drive and no one was anywhere near the bell desk (so the nice people at the front desk helped cover for them while my car was in the drive).  I tried to pick up luggage and again the front desk people needed to cover for them.  I tried to get a beer and waitstaff were nowhere to be found so a bar back covered.  When it was time to leave, the shuttle bus wasn't prepared for all the passengers so half of us were left on the drive until another driver made it happen for us.  Nice people but it is like they didn't know the kind of hotel this was and weren't prepared for the volume.  Elevators were VERY precarious (bouncing all over the place).  I was always scared I wasn't going to make;3
"Getting into LAX at night, I waited for the hotel shuttle with about 10 other people - after about 45 min of waiting, one full shuttle stopped and one drove by.  Every other shuttle came by over and over.  Ended up spending $20 for a taxi and many others did as well.    Now the hotel staff was very understanding - I was given $20 credit in the restaurant bar AND free parking - I was very pleased.  However, I found out that by using the ""voucher"", I was automatically charged 16% gratuity (I always tip 20% anyway). I had no idea about this and this should be communicated at the least.  The hotel is definitely in need of an update although they are going through a remodel so maybe it'll be nicer next time.  Last issue was that for the price, about $140/night, I could've stayed at a";3
Stayed in 2 night. Location is super close to LAX with shuttle service provided, quick check in, quiet environment even though there are many guests with the ongoing event. Room is clean and tidy. This is the seamless connection service that i am looking at after a long flight.;4
Dear staff, my apology for showing up on your doorstep at 1am, trying to contribute to your wage with my spending. How rude of me. I should have known that you cannot be bothered. I’m also sorry to complain about a rather diabolical room including broken electrical fixtures and trashy furniture. I’ll promise to not bring my kids to expose them to any life danger, nor will I be spending a romantic night at your property to save you from any embarrassment. Well done Sheraton brand.;1
This was the last stay on our motor cycle odyssy across the US on Route 66.  It was a Great place to ,at back and rest. Before moving on.  Nice clean rooms and free shuttle to the airport.  It has everything that you want.  There is also a restraint and bar if you need it.;5
This is a good hotel close to LAX. The rooms are clean and tidy and the staff excellent. This is a good option if you need to stay close to the airport. They also have a convenient shuttle to and from the airport;3
Overnight between long international flights, we needed a dark and quiet room. This hotel provided that plus the usual amenities. Right by the airport, with frequent shuttle service to and from LAX. We had a ton of luggage and the hotel provided great service and accessibility.;5
Basic Four Points hotel, I arrived late in to the, after midnight so I did not get to do much other than sleep. The room showed its age and is in need of updating, the shower didn't really work correctly had to fiddle with it for a good five minutes.;3
I am a SOLO traveler and I was traveling since march. In USA most of the Hotels ask a deposit at the arrival. Everyday I changed hotel and if I need to hold a deposit on the credit card is just crazy because the bank hold the amount for days or months, on top of that, the credit card has limits as well, so make some payment will be a nightmare for who change everyday hotel.  I asked at the Receptionist to take the payment of the room straight away and if they could take the deposit in cash. They accepted even if wasn't their policy but they wanted to help. Thanks.  The Receptionist explained everything about the hotel, check in, check out, elevator, breakfast, bar, mini bar etc.  They have a swimming pool and a cool area.  The breakfast was AMAZING and full of different quality;5
We recently stayed for 1night at this hotel , transfers were great from LAX airport to hotel and back , checkin was great very friendly staff , I understand the hotel is about to go under some renovations which is good as our room was big but very aged , when we arrived the air conditioning was off so the room was very hot and had a really bad musty smell , also the bathroom had marks up the wall and didn’t seem very clean , the air conditioning took several hours to cool the room down which wasn’t good as we did arrive at 8 at night , most hotels I have been to when checking in have a light and the air conditioning on ready but this wasn’t the case for us , at reception they did note the coffee, tea and water in the room was included which was a lovely touch , the breakfast was;2
Very nice hotel close to LAX.  Highly recommend for a stay if you have to catch an early flight.  Shuttle goes 24 hours every 20 minutes.  Room was spacious, good pillows, nice bath.  Grill had good pub food.  Would like to see the coffee bar open later and earlier for convenience.;4
"I flew into LAX from Uk so booked this hotel so that I could go straight to the hotel from the airport for one night. It’s quite close to the airport and there is a free shuttle bus but I had to wait about 30 mins for it to arrive; whereas in that time I saw several for Sheraton Gateway.   However, arrived ok. Check in was quick. Room on 3rd floor clean and spacious with free water and coffee machine. Comfortable bed.   Breakfast next morning was nice but pretty typical for these hotels and about $20. The elevators were not working very well (at least one of the three was broken) and so sometimes there was quite a wait. Staff were friendly.   It’s not spectacular. A tiny bit run down in parts. The shuttle seems a little infrequent. But overall I was satisfied with the stay and";4
I arrived last October 5 and stayed for 3nights the shuttle pick up driver from airport was very helpful when I arrived the hotel around 5pm its quite busy at the reception area from reception to restaurant I can say the staff are friendly and attentive just a little lack of personal touch thou but that can be improved the hotel has its own fitness gym without a gym instructor so you have to take extra careful in using the gym equipment, an outdoor swimming pool is huge to accommodate big group but since its colder at that time I preferred to have my hot shower inside the room the breakfast doesnt have any varities for straight 2days so I decided to have my 3rd day breakfast on the next block hotel.;4
Arrived LAX Term 6 Tues 7:40 pm. After waiting 20 min & seeing many hotel shuttles go by twice, called hotel & asked eta. 'Momentarily' was reply.  After another 10, took a $6 uber that took 5 min.  On arrival, noted hotel shuttle just sitting there. I prechecked in on SPG app so got to my room swiftly. Fired up the laptop & immediately noticed despite a strong (4 bar) wifi connection, email taking eternity to sync, websites ten minutes to load (if they loaded at all.). Called front desk & they said 'to try again later.'  This problem continued all night & following morn. Elliptical Machines in gym are old, tired, & need overhauls. My machine said 'paused' whilst I was pedaling every 5 minutes.  Wasn't just me. Noticed same on 2 other machines.  Bar food response time is hit or;3
First off, if your flight is arriving LAX past midnight just get a cab and bill the hotel. The shuttle does not come every 20 minutes (nor even 45 minutes rotations). Repeated calls to the hotel to rouse the driver from his stupor were finally successful. I was told by other travelers this is not uncommon. So touch down at midnight and in the room by 1:30 a.m. for a 10 a.m. meeting in Santa Monica.   Check in was efficient as was the upgrade. The rooms reminded me of my old Soviet Union student days updated with used Ikea furnishings - admittedly though it was clean. The hotel itself is sort of faded and ramshackle, which sort of fits of the post industrial, post service sector ghetto that area of Airport Way is. Be aware of the local wildlife in the form of bums, transients and;3
Room had a musty smell, bathroom door had paint peeling away from it, and no real amenities in room to write home about.  An average hotel, incredibly difficult to find parking and will not stay here again.  Dissapointed in Sheraton since my last stay was so wonderful.;2
Had a quick stopover here while we visited the Rose Bowl for the CU/UCLA game. Not the best hotel property but it did the trick for a few hours of sleep. Hotel is average at best and the rooms could use some updates. Rooms are small and ours had a small odor. For the price, you can deal.;2
Not a Five Star Hotel by any stretch of the imagination, but clean, convenient and catering well to the transit individual or family. Opposite the drop off for Budget Rent a Car, not overly priced and safe;4
Strange furniture distribution in the room, the TV only faces the windowd well,it didin't work and nobody would come to fix it, anyway). I found it very expensive for the very limited service provided;2
The best thing about this hotel is that allows early check-in if pre-booked. This is a fantastic feature after arriving on an early morning flight from Australia. Check in/out speedy and efficient. Nice pool to relax with jet lag. Fairly expensive but with the early check-in makes it worthwhile.;4
Excellent two nights in the conveniently located airport hotel. Shuttle bus prompt, Lawrence in Hotel Guests (Concierge) extremely helpful. Front Desk - Monica - very considerate and pleasant and made you feel welcome and understood issues with late flights. Brewster's Bar & Grill ideal to watch the game, enjoy a refreshment and reasonably priced snacks. Breakfast Buffet in the morning ideal to start the day off. Four points out of four.;4
Well I would have to say we wont stay here again but it has nothing to do with the Hotel. Loved the staff and the room was wonderful.  OMG, the bed was amazing.  It's just a bit to far from the family and the little downtown area that we love to go to when in Culver City.;4
Nice welcome at the Check-in and the room was clean and comfortable. We only spent the one night there, and it was fine. We at first thought the Concierge very helpful when advising us that Taxi to Hollywood Boulevard would cost around 30 USD - unfortunately it ended up costing 3 times that much due to the traffic - though this is not the hotels fault - just beware of the timing of your taxi!  I was disappointed with the fact that we had only disposable cups, stirrers and plastic 'glasses' - we soon found out this was common - but the impact that these have on the environment is immense - and surely, it is cheaper in the long run to have re-usable china and glass - PLEASE BE MORE 'GREEN';3
Stayed on the Hotel before a early flight out of Los Angeles, The Hotel was as expected not reale a hotel with soul just a plain hotel with a bed to sleep in. location i regard to the airport is very good.;3
I've stayed in this hotel 4 times always had a good experience but this time we needed a good night of sleep before taking our long flights so we chose to stay close to the airport   The rooms have been renovated and look nice but they forgot to take the extremely noisy AC I am not fuzzy about noise but I literally couldn't sleep because of the noise of the AC if we turn it off we were hot so we ended up having it on which really disturbed our sleep.  It's like having a big truck in your room just awful!   For a price of nearly $200 USD a night I will go somewhere else where is peaceful .. probably my last time in this hotel.;1
Really awesome hotel. Neat and clean, super friendly and helpful staff, shuttle service, nice pool, good sized rooms and lovely baby cot. There is a nice restaurant/bar downstairs and it’s only about a 30 minute drive to Hollywood Boulevard. Downside is it’s obviously a bit noisy at night due to the planes and fact that it’s next to an international airport - but it’s expected and really not unbearable unless you’re a super light sleeper. I loved it though. Would go back anytime.;4
I did not even know Four Points was connected with Sheraton until I stayed at this hotel. It was conveniently located close to the airport (LAX), meaning there was a free shuttle to/from the hotel & airport. The shuttle didn't run very regularly and seemed to miss certain terminals so if you need a shuttle, I would anticipate waiting time.  There is a parking lot available behind the hotel - it is quite pricey but we went as a large group so we were able to get a group rate on the parking. There are many places to eat a drives distance away - it is difficult to get food anywhere outside the hotel without a car. However, the hotel does have its own restaurant that offers a variety of foods and a bar area as well as a cafe.  The building as about 6 floors and an east wing and west;4
My room was good sized and most of all, important to me, had a tub ( so many business hotels have taken the out). I liked the espresso place in the lobby - handy and good coffee ( although I always had to wait for someone to appear). and the breakfast place was quick with good oatmeal. I thought it was pretty quiet and I slept well there. I did find the lobby really cold while I was there- air conditioning run amok? Good prices!;4
Rooms are nice comfortable with a helpful staff. I like to use their park and fly offer however it does seems like we wait a long time for our transportation back to the hotel from LAX. A bit pricy but overall not too bad of a deal. The food at the hotel is so so but edible.;4
This was a great hotel to stay at especially for the 2 lay overs I had in LAX. The staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel was clean and well presented. I also used the hotel gym and wasn't bad for a hotel gym. Rooms were tidy and great beds and pillows.;4
We took advantage of their park-sleep-fly deal. Expected a nice Sheraton property and a shuttle ever 15 minutes from LAX as advertised. Didn't happen. Although the lobby area is impressive, the rooms are jus a step above Motel 6 (complete with paper cups). One of the reasons we picked this hotel was its proximity to the airport and their advertised 3 shuttles running 24/7.  After a very long flight, it was irritating to wait well over 30 minute for the shuttle.;2
I think that out of all the hotels I have stayed in, this one was horrible. The room I was giving felt liked it was just cleaned up by a dirty rag. I asked for another room and was told that it was sold out. On top of the front desk being rude and myself feeling uncomfortable, I had no choice but to keep the room. I hope 2017 brings this hotel a new management.;2
We stayed here one night before flying home.  The room was very damp - even though the A/C was on everything felt damp.  There was a funny smell in the hallway.  Bathroom very small.  Room service trays left in the hall until late afternoon.  The elevators were not working consistently at all - much confusion about whether we could take them or not.  On the plus side, the complimentary breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful.;2
Everything was good, the service, check in so fast, our room was ok with all the facilities. The airport was near. I went there because someone told me it was the perfect place for just a few days. Overall a Nice experience.;5
Stayed there for one night in May 2017. I had requested in advance that our room be cleaned without fragrances and toxic cleaning products, and they seemed to have done just that. The air inside our room was just fresh and breathable, with no chemical odors or discernible fragrances. This was the best I had ever slept in an airport hotel.;5
The airline stranded me at LAX and sent me to this hotel. Had to wait a long time for the airport shuttle. I watched the vans from other hotels pass three or more times before this one arrived. While other hotels have more than one van running on a Sunday, this hotel has one. The same was true first thing Monday morning when you'd think they'd put a second driver on knowing people would be traveling.  The staff were very helpful and nice. Check in was incredibly fast. The room was as you'd expect - clean and usable but nothing special. For some reason neither the clock nor lights near the bed worked. I'm sure they would have addressed this if I'd called the desk but I only had a few hours to sleep and didn't want to be bothered. It does seem like something housekeeping should;3
We stayed here the first night in LA after a 14 hour flight landing at 6 am. We went straight to the hotel from LAX. I had requested early check in but nothing is guaranteed, much to our delight after the long flight we were checked in straight away. The hotel is located right near the bus stop for the big blue bus if you want to go to Santa Monica beach and sight see. In the early evening we went to the pool bar and stumbled across free beer tasting and pulled pork tacos, this happens every Wednesday in the pool area compliments of management. We had a great stay here and for the price compared to some of the other airport hotels we have stayed at this was more than comparable if not better. We will definitely return.;4
Great for the airport and free shuttle provided. Staff very friendly. Pool was great and the poolside bar tender Jose was so helpful.  Room clean but small and bathroom needs renovating.  Did not have breakfast at Hotel. Concierge very helpful and a safe room provided to leave luggage on day of departure. Good for one or two nights only as far from the centre of Los Angeles.;4
I was impressed that checkin took less than a minute, and I was headed up to my room shortly after I arrived at the hotel.  Unfortunately, while much of the hotel has been updated, the rooms and elevators are still pretty dated and don't have much more than a new coat of paint or furniture to hide it.  The LAX shuttle is functional and the wifi is ok, but still rather slow.;4
stayed with them for 2 nights. lobby looks nice but the smell of the place is old. once  you get to your room you would realize that it's only a normal room, i thought a sheraton badge means superior quality, it's not...a potential fire trap because the exit are too far out on some of the rooms and inadequate signage for exit or emergency. the carpets look so old to me. the hotel shuttle is unreliable if you get to LA at night. hotel food is average, find somewhere else to get the value out of your money...;2
This hotel is quite dated and the shuttle service is terrible compared to other hotels in the area. The driver only leaves every 20 minutes no matter how many people are waiting. They really need to get the shuttles going more often if they are advertised as an airport transit hotel. The restaurant closes early but room service was available. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.;3
The lobby may look nice, but the room was a dump.  It smelt bad, very musty, and the bath didn't drain properly so your ankles got a bath while the rest of you had a shower.  Bathroom was tiny, and there were large rust spots on the door and walls.;1
Wanted to like this property but it was straight out of the ghetto. If they are advertising remodeled rooms they need to keep up with the freshness of the room. Picture frame in the bathroom was pealing apart. There was rust on the hinges. The beds were NOT comfortable at all. The TV was smaller than expected.  The vending machines by the ice machine were all sold out. Went down to the cafe only to find out it closes at 8. Overpriced water and soda. No snack shop available for sundries.   I'll gladly spend an extra 20-30$ and have much better amenities from Hilton, Sheraton, Marriott,  etc.;1
I stayed a night in an upgraded room on my status with SPG. It's a busy hotel that looks like it's had a fair amount of updating in common areas including the lobby. The rest of the hotel is on the dated faded side. Comfortable but a bit tattered. Comfortable bed and large room was nice for my upgrade. Shuttle in the early am was packed and a 15 min wait. Nice they had guest laundry machines available.;3
"Just so you are aware the room was nothing like the pictures, they should mention online that the bathroom is tiny, the furniture is gross, sheets and carpet are stained up and tell people that we would have been better off in a Motel 6 for half the price. I hope you do not get roped into staying in this dump. Also when they change the sheets they should make sure they aren't stained from someone's sweat or God forbid period blood. I have also removed this hotel and hotels from my corporate list so that none of my employees are EVER booked into a Sheraton Hotel or a ""low rate Sheraton Hotel"" as this was an unpleasant experience. Also you should note employees speak to their guests like trash, as my oldest son was called ""hey you kid"" by some weak excuse of a concierge. Just so";1
Recently stayed at Four points hotel at LAX. Booking was made easily price was reasonable. Pickup from the Airport was confusing  as i rang the hotel to advise them i was ready and what was i required to do. I was told stand under red hotel shuttle sign and wait for a black bus. I waited and waited and saw a white bus go past but knowing there are other 4 points in the area didnt really take notice of it. Then another white bus appears and it clearly said 4 points Sheraton LAX but not black. So i had missed the bus a few times waiting for a black  one to arrive as advised. Front desk reception isnt clearly marked or in a place you quickly identify as reception. I went to the desk near the door where the staff member was busily and fully engaged in a personal discussion with;3
Given the extent to which I travel, I'm tolerant of minor matters in hotels and the Marriott / Starwood chains are usually good. However, I was surprised by Four Points by Sheraton at LAX.  The hotel is large and handles a transient population, so one has to factor this into matters.  However, I encountered a tired hotel, a damp room - in which the main room light switch was not working and the drainage in the sinks was very poor. This was a surprise given the pricing of the hotel.  I will do my best to avoid staying in this accommodation again.  As no staff member asked how my stay was and I was in a rush, I did not raise the matter with ground staff.;2
We stay here for a night after a trip back from Hawaii. We use to travel a lots so we test many facilities and we are not usual to send negative reports. Unfortunately this experience was not positive. Rooms need to be renew asap, as you can see in our pics. All looks old. We save only the lobby, that looks really new and cool.;2
What a great hotel close by one of the busiest airports. Short taxi ride but they do have a free shuttle that runs frequently and is no more than 10mins away. Excellent facilities. Rooms were very tidy and service was terrific.   My only complaint with 24hr Airport Hotels is that they don't cater for early arrivals although they did their best and we had our rooms by 10-30am but this was 3 hours after we arrived from a very long flight from Australia. What I find intriguing is that this Hotel said their cleaners only started at 9am. From a business perspective I can't see why they wouldn't employ cleaners around the clock, charge us extra to access rooms upon arrival. They had plenty of rooms because many guests left at say 4 and 5 in the morning to catch flights so it was only;4
Location , convenience , friendly staff , cleanliness  ease of access from the airport make this hotel exceptional .  Booked in and was immediately offered free membership of scheme giving e free parking for my stay saving $30 pd .;4
"I had a work convention for the weekend of Aug 11-13 and stayed at this hotel;  Pros: > Decent room; it was kept clean and had most amenities but I did have to call front desk to ask for more items > Quick service- items were brought up very quickly and housekeeping was great as well > Good price- for a weekend trip, this was a very good hotel > Convenient location- it was a quick 20 minute drive to the Santa Monica Beach and Pier > Check in/out was very efficient; I ended up checking in and out later than planned and there were no issues  Cons: > The shuttles are running but they aren't very convenient or reliable";5
"The hotel is okay for a 3-star hotel.  The rooms were clean, the bed was somewhat comfortable. We asked for a quiet room, so we had no disturbances.  My biggest issue was the shuttle from LAX to the hotel.  Supposedly, they run at least 2 shuttles all the time.  However, after waiting for almost an hour for the shuttle to arrive, calling the hotel three times to find out where the shuttle was, I was finally told that they were ""sending a shuttle to pick us up"".  There were so many people waiting for the shuttle at the airport terminal, that everyone couldn't fit into the bus.  When we finally arrived to the hotel, I went to the manager at the check-in desk and told him about this.  His response was ""Yeah, about an hour wait sound just about right.""  Then he went on to do";2
Ideal for a short stopover. Free shuttle to and from the airport.   Easily accessible downtown or Sta Monica by uber for $20/25 a time.   Rooms clean and comfortable.   Lobby bar offers a reasonable menu and food drinks selection.   Overall does the job very well.;5
The room was nice but needed some updating. That honestly didn't bother us. There were just a few hiccups during our visit. We actually landed a lot earlier that we thought. The lady at the front desk on Monday 8/14/17 at 8am was very rude. I was trying to ask her if we could check in or at least leave our luggage while we roamed around and wasted time but she kept interrupting me. She made me so angry I just walked off. I've never been treated so badly at any hotel and we travel a lot! Most of the time the hotel will accommodate you but not this time. I couldn't even get a word in. We finally decided to go to Universal Studios and spend the day there so it worked out. When we got to the room it was clean so no complaints there. The second night our room key stopped working and;3
We Stayed here with a 1 year old and a 4 year old...to have a rest after long international flight from Australia to lax, before next domestic flight to Milwaukee. Calling the hotel, spoke to a woman who wasn't nice or friendly at all, but on arrival got served by a lovely gentlemen who organized early check in for us. My 4 year old was hungry and eyeing off the banana that the lady behind me was eating, telling me how much he NEEDED a banana!!! Lmao. After check in, I asked the guy where's the closest place I could get a banana, and he went into the kitchen and grabbed me a bunch. Great customer service. 50 room deposit for the 2 nights. Had room service, was expensive but very convenient and fresh. Had Denny's for breakfast which was ok, bout 10 min walk. Budget car rental is;3
Not thrilled by this place. The carpet had big stains on it and the walls had lots of scuff marks. The lobby is nice and the staff is friendly.  Pool is very nice. Restaurant and bar are ok.  The menu for the restaurant and bar were mostly the same.  Wifi in the room sucked.;3
I stayed one night because I had an early flight out of LAX the next morning.  Couldn't have been better!  Terrific front desk staff at check-in and check-out, spotless room, great amenities, fast WiFi, awesome water pressure.  Room service was speedy and the food was excellent!  Although I was within a mile of the airport, there was no airport noise to disturb my sleep. Took the airport shuttle the next morning and was dropped right at my airline in plenty of time.  Highly recommended!;5
"We stayed here because our conference was being held in this hotel. We ended up leaving early because the hotel is so bad. We changed rooms 3 times. Every room smells like smoke. Banged up furnishings. Dirty bath tubs. Dirty ripped carpet. Noisy. The staff is awful and non-responsive. If you're looking to save money, go to a Motel 6 or something because honestly it will probably be better and certainly can't be worse. Don't pay the SPG prices for nasty roadside motel accommodations and service. See photos for our ""upgraded"" room.";1
I got in late from the airport and they had a 24 hour shuttle and a check in until 2am which is nice. Its very close to the airport. I arrived a little after 2am and they had no problem. The hotel lobby is nice, cool lounge area, and has a view of the pool.. It seemed all good until I got to my room. Right when I walked in, it smelled like old rug. It was a basic room which was fine since I just needed somewhere to sleep for the night but it just felt old and dirty when looking around. Everything was dusty, the bathroom was a bit rusty, and that rug smell. The lighting could've been way better.  The only thing I really liked in the room was the bed. Very comfy.. Also don't expect good wifi.  It was so slow and barely worked. Even in the lobby it was very spotty.  This was fine;3
The hotel overall has wonderful services and wonderful staff especially Martha Esparza who assisted us and give us her undivided attention. She was genuine and super informative. The only reason I do not give this place five stars is because of the inconvenient fees for parking and for breakfast which most places include. However Martha assisted us with that as well and I'd like to give her a big shout out. If it weren't for Martha and hard-working people like her, this place will just be another hotel on the strip. Thank you for making our last day of our honeymoon memorable.;4
Rust all over bathroom that keeps just getting painted over. Not sure if that is blood on the door or what. You can't even open the nightstand and no outlets by the bed for your phone. The ice/water machine missing.;2
"Other than comfortable beds, a nice pool area and close proximity to LAX, this hotel does not offer a lot. The wifi might as well be nonexistent, it's unusable. I wasn't able to use my Roku (streaming devices are not supported by the hotel-for security reasons, supposedly...plus the lack of wifi would render it useless anyhow). On my first night, only 6 channels on the TV would come in. Someone was sent up and after talking to the cable company, he rectified the problem.  There isn't any complimentary coffee in the lobby, just a Mr. Coffee coffee pot in the room. The menu selections at the hotel are meager. The nighttime buffet at the ""comfort"" is a joke (especially for the $20 charge). We went on a Sunday night and the ""buffet"" consisted of a salad bar (which offered about 5 or";2
The only positive for this property is its location close to the aeroport.  The food is terrible, the room, they upgraded us to 688 a Junior Suite was poor at best.  The bedside table draws would not remain closed and it was th absolute worst WiFi connection I have ever had at any hotel.  Dial up speed was better years ago.;3
Its near the airport, its reasonable priced compared to the other hotels in the area. staff is very friendly, pool is plain but they have one, elevator is slow, but room is okay. Lights are only from 4 different lamps.. So everything is okay except that they didnt give a toothbrush 😭 breakfast is 20 dollars so little pricey And limited selection but they had all my favorites to eat in the morning so no complaints there really;3
Check in was super quick, super essential after a long or early flight.   had a shock in the room because the curtain couldn't be drawn all the way, and im one whom sleep in total darkness. I later realised that behind the white curtain there's an extra black out curtain that you can pull downwards which was awesome.   check out was smooth and there was the shuttle bus that runs every 20 mins to airport.  we travelled in a party of 3 and 2 of us had 1 luggage and 1 additional box each ( less than 10kg). we were going to terminal 7 ( last terminal) the driver helped took the boxes and luggage down, turn to look at us and asked explicitly for tips!  I mean, we would have given him anyway as a good gesture but that was really rude for him to ask.   We later asked the other 2 locals;4
"This was the ""preferred"" hotel selected by the organizers of a conference I attended. I decided to stay there so I could spend more quality time with fellow attendees. My experience from the start was not a pleasant one. The self parking garage was dirty with litter strewn about and poorly lit. The room I was assigned was very dated with popcorn ceilings and in need of a complete remodel. On a positive note, the front desk staff were very friendly and after I complained, they assigned me to another room. My new room had been upgraded and, although nicer than the first room, it was far from great. Size of the room was good but it had a very small tv and a very noisy a/c unit that made it difficult to sleep. I did not get one decent night of sleep during my 4 night stay. The";2
This hotel did not satisfy all my expectations but I will start with positives: 1. Excellent staff - very friendly, engaging, supportive and cooperative.  2. Beds: comfy as would expect from this brand. Same for pillows.  3. Cleanliness: very clean and tidy.  4. F&B: reasonably priced options within the hotel.   The negatives: 1. Room: it is a very, very old layout where the hotel block may have originally been built in 1960s with a corridor along the perimeter (like in an inn or motel) with the rooms (door opening and adjacent window) inwards. Therefore everyone walking through the corridor is heard through the window, let alone the door.  The curtains are sheer but a roll down blind is provided however this doesn't completely block out the incoming corridor light nor the;3
Somewhat dated hotel and in need of a refresh (maybe already underway). Benefits, close to LAX, clean, spacious, friendly service, easy checkin/out, comfy bed, moderate price, shuttle, pool (not used), restaurant (not used). Good WIFI, no cable TV, but paid on demand. Close to car rental companies. For an older hotel the noise from the airport was much less than expected and we had a good sleep. Shuttle to and from hotel was good and not issues, just watch for them and flag down. They also provided an early check-in and also 24 hr reservations which is great for a late night flight. Some food nearby (Dennys, Burger king), not far from Westfield Culver City for more food and shopping options.;3
The hotel was nice...people were friendly... the rental car service was was horrible...dont do it...got the car for 2 days... got charged a great rate..returned the car the same as I got it..filled the tank.. dropped it off early.. was charged an additional $425.00 after I dropped it off..What the hec? And they wont even answer the phones or call me back..They say that its not part of the Hotel..but guess what..Its in your lobby...;2
This hotel is great to stay at if you are looking for something near the airport. It is only about a 7 minute drive or so to the airport from here and there is a free shuttle. This hotel did seem a bit busy, so give yourself some extra time to check out and catch the shuttle. The pool area was better than expected and had towels and enough chairs with cabanas. The rooms are standard Sheraton sizes and are bit older, but perfect for short stays.;4
"I was forced to wait an hour and a half for a shuttle to return me from the airport to the hotel.  Recall they advertise a shuttle every 15-20 minutes.  NOPE!  That’s total BS!  When I called the hotel to check on the status of the shuttles, after already waiting 45 minutes, the staff would either: hang up on me; place me on hold and not return to the call; or just laugh at me.  RUDE!  The entire staff was so completely rude to me relating to this entire experience that I will NEVER return to this property again.    I witnessed shuttles from many of the surrounding hotels such as the Renaissance, Aloft, JW Marriott, Double Tree by Hilton, Embassy Suites, Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites, Park Plaza, LAX Marriott, Hilton LAX, Sheraton Universal, Sheraton Gateway, Westin LAX, and";1
Old hotel. Needs renovation. Smells bad outside the room. Air conditioner is loud.  Parking fee is very high. Not your typical Four Points Sheraton. Stay elsewhere. Location is ideal only for airport transfer travellers not for others.;1
Of all the hotels I have stayed in the world, this was THE BEST welcome I have EVER received. I had worked a full day then flown overnight from New Zealand, so wasn't feeling amazing. Went to check in and was greeted by Trish. I was an hour early for check in, but Trish found me an available room.  When the check in process was complete, Trish asked me if I had any questions. As I was travelling to El Salvador the next day I needed to change my $100 notes for smaller ones. Trish changed a couple for me and advised me when the cashier would be in the next morning and they would be able to change the rest. This is going above and beyond!  The room is your stock standard American hotel room. Clean and tidy, and by this point that is all I cared about after a 27 hours of no sleep.;5
I have to be honest and say that I was a little disappointed by this hotel.  As it was under the Sheraton name I was assuming it would be better than it was.  The photos make the hotel (and especially the pool area) look a lot better than it was.   The hotel itself was fine, although the reception was not labelled and I dragged my luggage to the other end of the hotel before being sent back the way I'd come!  The staff were very friendly and greeted us very warmly.   The room was fine, but on a very long corridoor with a bizarre window facing the corriddor and no other intenal windows - if the curtain was open everyone could see in meaning little privacy, but if it was closed then it was dark as there were no overhead lights and only lamps!    We tried to go for dinner in the;3
Great location, nice room, great service. No free breakfast ☹️ Will stay again. Close to airport and car rental. Good price. Great amenities, pool, bar, lounge, restaurant, conference rooms, guests services...;5
The only reason I give 2 instead of 1 is because the foyer (restaurant, bar, front desk) is nicely organized, and they would check in people in the morning.  The rooms are poorly renovated. Bathrooms (at least ours) were untouched. Our bathroom door wouldn't even close. There was a significant lack of power outlets that they tried to compensate for with extension cords that were all used for the lamps. Soy we had to pick between charged phone or light in the room. The only mirror in the room has no power outlet nearby. The faucet in the shower was kind of broken. Worst part of all: The elevators. These were the slowest elevators I have ever had to use. I would wait up to 5 minutes in the morning for an elevator. By the time I make it to the lobby the elevator was always full and;2
Hotel really just ok and that's because it's proximity to airport and the shuttles service.  Check in quick and easy, then you have to wait forever for the elevator only 1 working!!!!  Room not a bad size bathroom the same maybe a little small but OK,  room had no fridge, TV frozen on welcome screen, aircon not working well.  Other issue for me no restaurant (are you kidding) was starving and all the had was a little coffee shop/bar and limited menu like burgers and wraps!!! I went to the Crowne Hotel around the corner for dinner.  Only reason I have 3 stars was because location to the airport.;3
The most convenient thing about Sheraton's Four Points was, of course, the location. I was already checking my reservation at the lobby just twenty to thirty minutes after getting to the hotel from LAX. The service was pretty good, the room was nice and contained a rather homely atmosphere, but what I liked most was the view from my fourth floor window at the busy and lively city. I really believe this hotel is over its four points. I'd honestly give it five stars.;5
Our stay was comfortable. Room size was decent. Hotel is next to airport and provides free transfer to and from it which is good facility. There was no issue on any front. Check in counter was efficient and very helpful.;5
We were greeted at the front desk with fresh cookies and 2 vouchers for the breakfast.  We stayed in a newly renovated room and it was a king size with comfy beds. It was clean, comfortable and had a view of the Budget rental car parking lot across the street, which is very convenient. The breakfast area had tons of tables and the service was excellent. The hotel in almost located right in the middle of everything and very easy to get around with uber. There are a few places to eat in the area if you don't want to eat at the restaurant and all within walking distance. [ we never ate at the restaurant ] My only complaint would be that the rooms that face Airport Blvd are a litte noisy with all the traffic.;4
The Four Points by Sheraton was our headquarter hotel for a recent conference in Los Angeles and provided a convenient location close to the airport and LMU. Rooms were average but comfortable and having food and beverage onsite was a plus. Only criticism was that the concierge was a bit rude and not helpful when asked questions about nearby restaurant options.;3
Free transfer to and from the airport. Easy check in and out. Nice bar downstairs. Pool and small gym. Free Wi-Fi. Very comfortable big bed. Only downside is that after dark it's quite isolated i.e. no shops nearby (apart from 1 fast food restaurant across the road);3
There's a bloodstain on the curtain. I was trying to close the window and I accidentally just touched it. I then threw up a little bit in my mouth.  Will update on status of my AIDS once I'm done with staying here.;2
I know there are a lot of Hotels around LAX area but I don't think you can go wrong staying at Four Points by Sheraton I requested a early Check in cause of our early flight arrival into LA at 6.30am Trish at the Front Desk managed to get us into our room after only a short wait. The Rooms were modern with a nice comfy Bed and our  room was very Clean and looks like there just been updated. We had a few drinks that night in Brewsters Beererie  and the buffet breakfast. Great Hotel in the LAX area.;5
After a 24hour travel experience from Jakarta, we wanted a hotel close to Los Angeles Airport before exploring the city because we had a lot of luggage. At the time of writing, we experienced extreme hot temperatures. So we always wanted to have cold drinks, to our surprise we do not have a refrigerator in our room. This hotel charged us $10.00 for the refrigerator, and they actually have someone bring up the fridge to your room and install it. Never experienced this.  Additionally, the rooms really need refurbishing. The interior is rather old with dated carpeting, We did not have any view because it is a room along a corridor like a Motel, but the difference is that it is indoors. We had to take whatever situation comes our way including the Fridge Fee because we had heavy;3
Overnight at LAX airport. Hotel was your average airport hotel, except in-room wifi was literally unusable. Staff were friendly but powerless to help with wifi issues. Connection in common areas was decent but unusable in room wifi for an airport hotel full of international travelers in 2017 is unacceptable.;1
We had an early morning flight out of LAX ado decided to book a room.   We get there around 9 pm.  We get off the elevator and I think we got the not so newly  renovated wing.  Looks like what used to be an outdoor hotel that they enclosed to make it indoor.  We walk into a dark room in which we flip the light switch and get nothing.  We have to proceed to dings our way around the dark room tho locate switches of individual lights.  There was an odor.  I swear it was from someone smoking.  Muy husband thinks it was just a stake room that needed aired out.   Either way it was rough.   Pillows stunk.  You could hear every time another room door opened or shut.   Bathroom couldn't have been any tighter but regardless it felt dirty.   Rust on the bottom of tub around drain.;2
I took my grandkids for a staycation on July 4th mostly to use the pool. Overall good experience. Basic but clean with friendly service.  On reviewing my check out bill I saw a $10 refrigerator fee.  I thought it must be a mistake but the hotel said no it's correct. Every room is charged for the refrigerator.  Has nothing to do with using it!  How damn chintzy! Charge $10 more for the room instead of adding a ridiculous fee on to get more money! You already charge an extra 30 to park and you know there is no place else to park.;3
Overdue review from Nov 2016... I booked a one night stay before an early morning flight. Well, pregnancy brain kicked in and I booked the wrong location, eek! It wasn't until we arrived onsite that we realized my mistake. Monica at the front desk was AMAZING!!! She called the other location and explained the situation then worked on her end to get us into a room. She spent 15 minutes on the phone to ensure everything was settled and we wouldn't be out of pocket additional money. Thank you to Monica. Truly impressive service.;5
The hotel overall was OK, rooms were clean, bed was comfy, etc  BUT, if you ever have a problem you will never get it resolved....They double charged me for the room, meals I never had etc, and the managers are horrible. They will not give you their cell number, no way to contact them, and they even tell the front staff to not tell clients when they are working.;2
My husband and I chose Four Points LAX purely because they are among the only ones to offer 24 hour check in. After a long haul flight from Australia and a full day tour booked for the same day we really wanted to be able to check in early so we could freshen up before our day out. The rooms are good with comfortable beds, they're in the process of being updated. I did find the process for organising the early check in a little tricky but I sorted it in the end before we arrived and we checked in about 8am , hassle free. Staff were friendly and helpful and the room service was prompt. The free shuttle bus to the airport was also convenient although most hotels in the airport offer the same service. All in all, a pleasant experience wouldn't hesitate in revisiting next time we;4
Our family stayed here at the end of our two-week road trip. We chose this hotel as it was conveniently located near the airport and car rental where we need to return our vehicle. They also have a airport bus service and the driver was friendly and seem to love what she is doing. The hotel is clean and has a no nonsense atmosphere. There is pool where we could unwind and cool down after our long trip and the lounge area was a great place to have coffee or tea to relax.;5
as you walk in the lobby look great, front desk person very nice and professional, once you get to room it began it look like a motel that a wall was built on the outside leaving windows to let the sunlight to come in to the window of your room. so it like a hall way guest are passing up and down at one point I had at least 5 guys look into the window when the TV was on ,why had no curtains that you could close there I was not able to sleep thinking someone looking in the window. never again!;1
We drove up from Auburn the night before to pick up my brother flying in from out of town for my nephew's wedding!  So glad we did he had an early flight.. we met him and went straight up to the room to relax before getting ready for the busy weekend! So convenient...;4
My husband and I stayed one night at this hotel before catching our flight back to Charlotte the next day.  We had a pleasant experience.  We were greeted by a Bellman named Musis who was very friendly and eager to assist us.  He had a positive attitude which gave us a good first impression of this hotel.  All of the personnel we had contact with were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel was clean and lovely inside.  We had a king room with a view which was nice.  The room was a decent size and the bathroom was spacious.  The hotel has two restaurants which include a main restaurant and a sports bar.  It was our anniversary and we thought the main restaurant of a 3.5 star hotel would have a more relaxing atmosphere and warmer setting, but it reminded us more of a cafeteria-type;4
Worst night of sleep. Took an hour to find a parking spot (after paying $30 a day extra for parking). Walls had zero sound proofing so heard doors banging all night and by 8 am we could hear the rooms around us talking. Rooms have little natural light because there is a hallway in front of the windows. When we told customer service about the bad night of sleep, they didn't seem to care about our negative experience. To top it off, though we were told the night before that we would have breakfast, it was not included and we had to leave the hotel to eat. It is not worth the stress and exhaustion of staying in this hotel.;1
Missed my flight to Thailand and had to spend a night. It was either too hot or too cold and noisy. The food at the restaurant is a disappointment, pricey and misleading and plagued with misrepresentations. Lomo Saltado is from Peru and they are lying when they say it is flamed with pisco, seriously? I bet 5000 they don't use a drop of pisco to flame it, it is a total lie. Note to management, before you reply to this review go to your kitchen and see if your cook uses any pisco then change your menu and then write me back;1
This is a pretty good, pretty busy airport hotel.  It is very very close to LAX.  I was surprised by how busy it was.  The bar was packed and it was quite a scene in there. There was a convention going on when we stay there, so it was just packed!    I would stay there again, but it's a little pricey and they charge a lot for parking. FYI you don't actually have to valet, you can self-park.;4
Came here the night before my flight. Went to the room and noticed it felt warm tried turning the ac on and it wouldn't get cool. Laid in bed and the sheets felt damp from the humidity of the room. Woke up at 230 to find the room at 88 degrees called downstairs and they said they couldn't get us a new room because they were sold out. We checked out the next morning and we're refunded 50 percent of our stay. Wish I could have better things to say about this experience.;1
This is a very poorly maintained and sadly decorated, run down hotel . The smell in the room and super noisy AC were unbearable. We arrived late ( no valet) so we moved to a different hotel the following day. Never again!;1
With shuttle service to and from LAX, this was a no brainer for us.  The hotel was perfectly adequate, and what you come to expect from Starwood, albeit not the best property I've been on, but it's ultra convenient to the airport, and it's a great value for the price.;4
We stayed overnight before our flight the next day. Beautiful hotel and great rate. The only downside is waiting forever for the lift. They were always full and when you have kids you can't exactly separate and go in different lifts. The shuttle service was great and very nice driver.;5
I stayed here for one night because of an early morning flight the next day. The attitude of the front desk was the worst I have ever experienced. They stood around and chatted whilst I waited for service. I was the only guest in line. There was no greeting, no acknowledgement of my presence. The room itself was clean though the bathroom was tiny and oddly-shaped.;2
I am a gold SPG member and requested a room that has already been renovated. So apparently after renovation  the rooms have no curtains . Only blinds . As you can see in images. I think a spg property cannot look like this !  The room seems more like a motel room . The lobby is impressive and the bar is good . But rooms are sad and the white led lighting in the room doesn't help ! And if you are a spg gold member don't think you will get any special treatment !;2
I enjoy the Sheraton 4 points hotel LAX. Juan and Johnny are an asset to Sheraton. They are always smiling and personable during check in/out. It is nice to know, after checking in to the hotel room, beds, bathrooms are clean. I always know, I can get at least 40 winks of sleep during my stay.;5
The common areas downstairs, bar, lounge area, reception, lobby etc appear to be have been upgraded sometime over the past couple of years and these areas were comfortable & fine.  The reception staff at check in were outstanding, especially Caesar and Pauly.  They were super friendly, helpful, courteous and kindly allowed us a 6pm check out as we had a late night flight.  We cannot speak highly enough about them - thank you!! The pool area was pleasant, although there are large floor to ceiling windows from the main lobby area that overlook the pool so there is no sense of privacy out there. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.  Upon exiting the lift on our floor, there was relatively new carpet however everything else was just plain outdated, old fashioned, dingy and;1
Great place to rest your tired body for 1 night before a long haul flight back to Australia. Has all the facilities including laundry and a great bar  for a wine or two. Free wifi is important to me and worked well and was fast!;3
If you love being just being one of hundreds of guest and feeling like your invisible this place is for you.  Check in is okay but it's a money making machine. Outrageous parking fees to ridiculous prices for a breakfast buffet is the name of the game. No breakfast included here.  The worst part was the fight in the room next door late at night along with the constant door slamming. I didn't even try to report it because of the poor response from the girl at the front desk before going to bed. The room was very hot with NO control over your a/c other than 3 fan speeds. When I called to ask I was told it had been corrected and should be cooling off soon. According to their brochure fans could be requested. I asked for a fan and she told me she would get me one. I waited about an;3
I used this hotel at the start of a motorcycle tour and found it welcoming. Adequate rooms and the breakfast buffet was fantastic.  The swimming pool was well used by us. The staff were extremely friendly and approachable.   God airport access with shuttle bus service.  Not difficult to get to most places and Venice Beach and Santa Monica were are just a short hop away by bus which is a lot cheaper than the taxi's and the bus drivers give you a yell for where to get off...;3
Booked this for a one night business trip because of price and location near LAX. The lobby and staff were nice. Lobby had bar and good work areas. Now the dislikes...parking. Had to pay $28 to park in a lot behind the hotel. I though that was excessive. Hence the cheaper rate. Also the room had newer furnishings but still was average at best. I would not stay here again. Took 10 minutes for hot water for the morning shower.;3
I had booked this hotel because it was coupled with the flight I had booked online via Expedia. Note to self: Always look at Yelp reviews first before any other reviews. I was mistakenly lead off by the reviews posed on the Expedia website, stating it was a four star hotel, I disagree. In regards to the price I paid, I thought it was not worth it. The hotel was fairly small, although it had a lot of floors, but the hotel was simple consisting of rooms, pool area, dining area and lounge area, not as ravishing as Expedia made it to be. Our rooms were clean and simple. Be aware that you will have to pay a 29.00 fee for parking daily, which is not included into your stay, to which if I would of known I would have not booked this hotel. The parking is horrible, very few parking, and;2
"The rooms look a little old; they need a little renovation , the rooms did not match how nice the lobby really looks. Good food (breakfast & dinner). Nice staff, clean pool& clean rooms.The wifi SUCKS.";3
Very close to LAX airport. Great shuttle service. Stay the night and include parking in gated area. Highly recommend using for park n fly. Rooms aren't fancy but affordable and clean. Less than 5 minutes to the terminals.;4
WiFi service is terrible. Stayed multiple times but the same. Wifi is unreliable, disconnects all the time. If you need wifi, stay away.   The window isolation is bad. Due to proximity to the airport there is too much airplane noise to prevent a good night's sleep.   Otherwise rooms are standard and clean. There is a reasonable work desk. Bathroom is small, Cannot get into the bathtub without closing the door first :-);2
Great place to park and fly if you leaving out of LAX...  super easy process, and reasonable.  Shuttle worked great, and staff inside the hotel are helpful even if you don't stay there. You can choose to use Valet for an additional cost if you want, but I don't think it's it is needed.;4
Worst experience ever at a Sheraton property. We stayed in one of their 'newly renovated rooms (#416).  There was at least a half-inch of dust accumulated in the bathroom wall vent.  The shower/tub drain was so clogged it wouldn't drain even with the stopper removed, so you finished your shower standing in dirty, soapy water over your ankles.  They have installed motion-sensor light switches in the bathroom.  Good idea, bad execution.  The sensors are located around the corner from the actual bathroom, in the small entry.  So after showering, and while sitting on the toilet, I had the nice surprise of the lights going out.  Total darkness and there was nothing I could do about it.    The actual room was large, but poorly designed.  The small TV is so far away from the bed that;1
So my airline made me miss my connecting flight so they provided vouchers for our stay, food and the shuttle service to and from the airport. The wait for the shuttle was about 30 mins and the ride to the hotel was about 5 mins. The driver was very helpful with my luggage. Upon arrival at hotel, I had to wheel my luggage in. Reception was a bit busy as it want just me that missed connections that night. They checked me in and explained how the vouchres for food worked and gave me the use of the Wifi as well. I lugged my suitcases to the room where I settled in for the night.   The room was adewuate. Clean and a bit cozy. Bed was very comfy.  Equipped with a small coffee pot to make tea or coffee and both of those were provided with osper cups and creamer/milk. The room had 2;3
I booked this hotel due to the fact it was so handy to the LAX airport and also had a free shuttle. I wasnt disappointed and for the price, was very pleased. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. There was a fault with one of my pull down blinds and it was prepared very promptly. I had a good nights sleep and was offered a late checkout due to my flight being in the afternoon. Would definitely stay there again;4
I have stayed at this property for over 15 years of travel to Asia. On my recent trip the shuttle service to the hotel was nonexistent. I waited for over two hours at the airport calling the hotel frequently without any shuttle service. I finally had to take a cab. I talked with a shuttle driver on the way back to the airport and he shared with me that the hotel contracts out its shuttle service and the contractor has not been paying drivers for over 4 months so they were not showing up for work. Additionally the propertyhad been upgraded to 5 stars which didnt seem accurate to me. I did not observe any of the so called upgrades to be a 5 star. Avoid this property!!;2
"Based on a review I read, I was about to book this hotel. Called to inquire about 24 hour checkout and was told only late checkout when available. When i mentioned the trip advisor review and the hotel's own website, she said ""third party reviews are not reliable and unsure why website claims 24 hour checkout.""";1
This hotel is very close to the airport with 24-hour shuttle service. It is convenient when you have a layover at LAX or a morning flight the next day.  The property is old and it needs a renovation as it shows a lot of wear and tear. My room was quiet although the old through-the-wall style air conditioner was noisy every time the AC compressor cycles on.   I ate in their restaurant and my steak dinner was good and properly cooked. Overall a decent choice when you need to stay overnight and be close to the airport terminals.;3
Decided on this hotel the night before flying out to hike 'The Big Island'. Clean, comfortable room, price was good, staff was very nice and accommodating. Exactly what we needed at the time. Would stay again if in the area.;4
This hotel provides a free shuttle service from and to the nearby LAX Intl Airport which is excellent. At reception the staff were polite and efficient. We did not try the restaurant on the evening following our arrival but did have breakfast there the next morning prior to our departure. We found it to be pleasant with nice food and good service. However there the pluses finish. The hotel has a sign next to the front entrance advising that the building contains materials found by the authorities to cause cancer. I immediately thought of asbestos. I did not notice this however until our departure and would not have stayed there had I known. On reflection a lot of older buildings probably contain asbestos and provided it is contained it won't cause a problem. However the hotel is;3
Great Hotel very curious staff, location and food, the exhibit hall for this show was very big and roomy. very day we were served lunch and everyone liked the luncheon food. I would stay at this Sheraton anytime we would do a technical program.;4
I had to pick my college son up from LAXv at midnight but then had a 5:30 am early morning departure so I decided to spend the night at the Sheraton to give me few more minutes of sleep. The hotel was incredibly convenient. It's one of the closest hotels to the terminals which is especially helpful when there's traffic on Century. They have a shuttle which took me at 4:30 that saved me an Uber trip and took all of 3 minutes and 2 stoplights to get to the airport. Check in was speedy and friendly. The lobby was bustling when I arrived and left, full of people from faraway time zones who were wide awake. There are restaurants and a helpful table with computers to print things out. My room was fine. Comfortable bed and sheets. Bathroom was too small and had to close the door to use;4
It is a good hotel but some areas are a old and not well maintained but the room was ok and the service really good.  The lobby area is big and spacious which I like. Airport shuttle runs very frequently and they have free wifi I would stay in this hotel again. I do recommend it.;4
This is really the perfect airport hotel. Why? The 24 hour checkin/checkout. I really don't understand why more hotels don't take advantage of this?  Is this hotel luxurious and beautiful? No. Is it totally convenient for a weary traveller? Yes!  We arrived at 5.30pm from a Miami flight and checkin was smooth and easy. The rooms were clean and comfortable. And 24 hours later at 5.30pm, freshly showered and well rested we checkedout efficiently and caught the short mini bus to the airport to board our flight to Australia. Keep up the great work guys!;5
I stayed here for a couple nights in March of this year and figured that, for the price, accommodations would be decent. The room was a bit run down, there was hair from previous guests in the bath tub, etc. The little bar area is cute and the staff at the front entrance was amazing. Even though I wasn't the happiest with the room, I booked another stay here for the next wknd and when I tried to cancel to stay at a different hotel, Sheraton kept my money and refused to refund. Disappointed.;3
Many thanks to receptionist Paulina Martinez who was very efficient, friendly, thorough in explaining hotel policies and procedures, and particularly helpful re parking for a handicap person.  Excellent welcome to the hotel.;4
Great hotel but you get charged for everything even the water in the room.NO Shower gel? Odd Bed was enormous. Clean rooms Good food but a bit pricy Great pool Great bar Kind and warm staff Close to airport but it is quiet in the rooms. Though people checking in and out are less considerate.  The rooms are large. .noisy air conditioning but needed.;5
We had to stay in LA on a layover and this was an option. If you use the shuttle from the airport make sure you get on the right Sheraton bus, there are several and it can be confusing. The rooms are outdated, the bed was comfortable, and the staff was pretty good. If I was going this way again I would probably choose somewhere else.;3
Has gone down in the last 2 years since I last stayed - a supposed refit has gotten better Wifi but otherwise the IT is a mess and you have to pay for it in the foyer.  Food has gone from bland to bad and the prices continue to rise - avoid the breakfast as this seems to have been sitting there since 2015.  But the staff are good, the queues are fair and the pool is OK.  Don't expect any extras - they are chargeable, but for what it is - perhaps 3 stars with a good location (DONT WALK OUT ALONE AT NIGHT !) it is fine;4
I'm so disappointed I will not leave a long review. They have a nice down-stairs bar, and the Desk staff were very personable. But the room was bad.  The mattress was extremely uncomfortable with old springs, the pillows were over stuff so they look good but really hurt your neck and could not be used. This hotel does not give you a little thing of shampoo but rather has a community dispenser attached to the wall in the shower.  There were body hairs on the sink wall and also on the floor near the toilet. The chair in the room was tattered. I could go on but there's no need to.  If you absolutely have to stay right next to LAX this would-be acceptable. But for 225 plus dollars I was expecting something at-least as good as Motel 6 and it is not.;2
Spent less than 24 hours here on my way to NYC. Hotel is not a number of other hotels near lax with a  bus from the airport. If you have a early morning flight this is a very good option.  There is a bus that picks you up just down the road from the hotel and will take you to Manhattan Beach and two other shopping centres.  The bus cost $5 and does a loop. You can hop off at all three places.  Manhattan Beach is the first stop. You can purchase your tickets at the hotel. The staff member who sold me the ticket was so helpful.  There is a nice big lobby area which I sat in while I waited. The rooms are big and have cable tv.  Overall very impressed with the hotel.;4
I had to stay there for a night recently. This hotel is old and needs some major renovation. Having said that, the staff are very nice and helpful, much better than some 5 start hotels. Overall it does the job if you need to stay next to airport and for a short time.;3
Positive: nearby the airport Negative: room was old, windows dirty and bathroom falling a part. It's far away from the main attractions of Los Angeles and the windows are not noise proof (it seemed like we had the airplanes flying in the room). BUT staff is really nice and helpful, and as I said, for only one night it's ok.;3
There is not much to say. This hotel is ok, but nothing out of the extraordinary. The property has seen its best days already. I would recommend to refurbish the property, esp. the carpets in the hallway.;3
Good value, rooms were clean, did the ride and fly, so easy to have shuttle take you to the airport!  We ate 2 meals there and both were very good The bar was a little high for dinks but staff was friendly!;5
This hotel is located very close to LAX. We stayed there the night before our early morning flight. We got the Park and Fly package. Everything went very smooth at check in.  However, when we got to our room, the air conditioner was not working. The room was stuffy and hot. I called down to the front desk and they immediately changed our room with no hassle. The second room was even more up to date. The shuttle to and from the airport ran like clockwork. We waited less than 10 minutes at Terminal 5 for the ride back to the hotel after a very long day of flight delays.;4
This hotel has very reasonable prices and is located close to the airport.  I stayed here when flying so I did not have to deal with traffic in LA.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  Bedding and other items in room are top notch.  Shuttle is on time and driver friendly.;4
The staff are very friendly and helpful, the hotel room has all the basics and is quite large and roomy. The bathroom is a bit run down but still acceptable. I found it to be good value for money. The room was also quiet.;4
The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable but restaurant and coffee shop are very basic.  The coffee shop hardly had anything to eat at breakfast time and the service attendant disappeared for a period of time and we had to find someone to serve us and provide coffee.  Not what you'd expect from an SPG property.;2
This hotel was a great value in LA when we were in town during spring break season, compared to what we would have paid at most hotels (100€ vs 120-150€ at comparable hotels). The rooms are clean, the furniture is of pretty good quality, the pool and gym are nice, the lobby looks good.  BUT: they charge $29 per night for parking!! I won't pay what almost what a crappy motel would cost to park my rental car. And there is no mini fridge in the room, you can get one for $10 a day, which is ridiculous. TIP: if you're visiting LA, chances are your car isn't going to be parked at the hotel all day long, so just park in the W 98th Street across the street from the hotel. You'll have to put money every two hours from 8AM to midnight, but if you leave the hotel at 9 or 10 in the morning;4
My company has put me in this hotel was a little skeptical at first however the people were friendly. The elevators were the slowest I have ever been in I waited 15 mins just getting a elevator. The room was nice for a junior suite overall alright.;3
Had to stay here due to my reservation at another hotel being cancelled due to overselling of rooms. It's located near to the airport so that's a plus, breakfast was good but not free. Rooms were large and comfortable, hotel itself looks a bit old but not a bad stay, we stayed 4 nights on business. I found the parking rates for the car to be a bit excessive like 25. Day or something close to that I forget. It's a nice place to stay if you are on a layover and want to get refreshed before you have to fly again. Would recommend if u don't mind spending a bit on the room, you pay for location, if u ask me. Similar hotels are available within half a mile. I use booking.com to generally book my rooms when I travel.;4
After having a very stressful flight from Australia and eventually my flight cancelled all together, my airline arrange that I stay in the 4 Points Sheraton. I was greeted by a young gentleman name Johnny who was nothing less than excellent! He checked me in early (which was such a relief after a 18 hour flight) and hooked me up with the strong wifi so I could knock out some work. After finding out that the airline misplaced my bag, he made sure that I had all the amenities I needed and recommended places to go for food and places to buy additional clothing. Being in the hospitality industry myself, I greatly appreciate all of Johnny's help and I am very grateful that I was placed at the 4 Points Sheraton. Great service goes along way and I would recommend the 4 Points Sheraton;5
"This hotel is very old, the bedding and some furniture has been updated; however, the bathrooms are very dated.  The tile in the shower has chips or missing sections, the floors and tile remind you of the 80's.    The pool and pool area get a definite thumbs up.  They have a very nice section of cabanas so you can watch the kids and be out of the sun if you'd like.  We were there during Spring Break and the kids swimming were all behaving.    Unfortunately, the breakfast gets a thumb down.  The food at the bar is very good, just skip the restaurant breakfast.    Also, the hotel shuttle is a dark brown with a small sign in the window, so it's very easy to miss.  (I'm guessing that it's leased.)  It may have circled me four times or more without my knowledge as I finally had";3
I have stayed here numerous times on trips out of Los Angeles for business and pleasure. Their Shuttle service is good and the staff is very helpful. The also have a Stay and drive program to leave your car up to 14 nights. Pretty good. Considering the cost per night otherwise to park. $ 35 to $ 37 standard in LA area....The Hotel is starting a remodel in late March 2017 so this may help many of the dated rooms. The lobby is very nice and the restaurant is passable but pricey. Overall it is a quiet place to stay with a nice pool to sit by or get sleep before an early AM  domestic flight or a  late PM flight overseas.;4
It was a life saver. Great place to stay Great Price especially near the airport. Room was comfortable and relatively quiet. Bed and pillows comfortable.Clean room.Clean bathroom like the soap dispensers in the shower.My room had a beautiful view of the sunrise.;4
Had a morning flight out of LAX, had been staying in down town, figured it would be less a stressful morning if I stayed close to the airport.  The rooms have been updated, but the property is probably really old, or at least that is how I felt.  Probably needs a tear down and rebuild to make it feel young again. Basic hotel, easy to get to the airport, slept well enough, I would stay again, as the price was not too bad.;3
Stayed over 3 nights on business.  The room was really old and I could tell they spent the least amount of $ to look better cosmetically.  The room smelled mold and I felt I got what I paid for (paid very little per night).;3
My husband and I stayed and parked our car for long term at this hotel because  they a have a stay and park your car package. The staff was very friendly. The room was a bit dated but clean, and the LAX shuttle was on time.;4
Free shuttle to Hotel to and from Airport. Circuits every 20 mins....to far to walk, had no probs at all on return Airport transfers. Friendly check in, basic rooms that are a little tired. No luxuries or extras....including what I think are the basics for this price bracket...no loose soap yet there was a soap dish. Shampoo, conditioner and Soap in liquid form screwed to shower wall only...no shower caps. Rooms were clean bed comfortable and a good size. Noisy aircon unit.;3
What can I say.  This hotel is very near the airport and convenient for people with a layover.  However, rooms are dated    and the carpeting  was gross.  Bed was OK and the food in the bar/grill was decent but overpriced.  Just OK;3
"Because of a missed flight, we had to spend the night in LA.  The first hotel we were booked into (by Choice Air) was so dirty that we didn't take our clothes off and we had to ignore the drug deals and ""dates"" being set up in the parking lot.  After many calls and complaints,  this hotel, the Four Points by Sheraton l was provided for us to spend the long day before a midnight flight to Australia.  We were assured by the help desk at Choice Air that we could have an early check in.  So we waited about half an hour and then uber-ed over to 4 points..  Of course, based on their track record, Choice Air was wrong and our room was not ready. The thought of waiting for hours for a room, when all we wanted to do was sleep and wash the last place off of us, seemed impossible.However,";5
This is my second time to this hotel. The hotel itself is fine but it bills itself as a convenient airport option.   But both times I've waited over 30 minutes for the shuttle.  Today we waited over 45 minutes even with me calling the hotel.   I figured the first time we were just unlucky but again today every other hotel shuttle stopped at least 4 times before 1 of their shuttles came.   I won't even both going back to the airport.  I will take a taxi.  And next time I will stay somewhere else.;2
We had an overnight layover and opted to stay at the Four Points.  Staff is very friendly, from the shuttle driver to the front desk staff to the bar staff.  The rooms needed a refresh, more lighting would have been nice.  The price of drinks at the bar was a bit ridiculous - my husband and I each had 2 drinks and it was $72.  Granted he was having a double but still - $12 per shot for something that especially in CA might cost 50 cents?  Tip-if you're going to LAX on a morning flight, make sure you get downstairs with LOTS of time before you really want to be at the airport.  The shuttle van gets full very quick and you may have to wait.;3
"If u need a place to simply crash, cool. If your expected a level of service, absolutely not. This place is missing a lot of basic hotel amenities. IF your a SPG member, they advertise free wifi, but that's for any hotel guest. SPG is not worth it here. If u need to utilize a safe, it's in the front lobby like halfway house arrangement or ""indoor"" motel.";1
For how crappy most hotels are, this is a decent, value choice. We usually stage here or the Marriott for our LAX flights. There is much better value here. The rooms are clean, if a bit dated. The bathrooms need a bit of maintenance (ours came with a slowly running toilet). Most annoying thing? No fridge in the room.  It makes it difficult when you have kids that want milk. The room was a bit noisy than I prefer, not with planes or yelling, but bumps and creaks.   The lobby is very nice, large and separated. It's not too noisy with people going in and out. The grab and go is good and fast, the restaurant was better than expected.   Shuttle service is better than the Marriott. They have 5 shuttles running in the morning on 15 minute intervals. Front desk was VERY honest and said;3
The hotel provides basic accommodations. It is very convenient to LAX so if you have an early morning flight you are good to go. The hotel shuttle runs 24 hours and is very handy.  The rooms, however, are very dated.  The hotel has seen a lot of traffic.  I will say that the staff is extremely helpful, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating rather than a 3 star. If you manage your expectations, you'll enjoy your visit.;4
We stayed at the Four Points during a quick visit to LA.  My wife is a Gold Level SPG member and we got an upgrade to a HUGE room.  The staff is nice.  The location is convenient to the airport.  However, when we first got into the room it was noisy due to airplanes, however, it eventually quieted down.  Not sure if they changed runway direction or not?   The room is a little dated, but was fine for our quick stay.  If you need to park a car, it is VERY VERY expensive.;3
When checking in to my room Saturday morning I was kindly welcomed by Martha! She exceeded my expectations of customer service with a kind friendly face, and willingness to answer questions. The transition from check in to getting my room was seamless and efficient.  Overall I was pleased with 4 Points and extremely pleased with Martha's customer service and spirit.  THANK YOU MARTHA!;5
Disappointed at best. I've stayed at this property and was excited to be back here after awhile away and I  was not impressed with the condition of the rooms.  The SPG floor was lacking and room not tidy or clean. With the renovation of the lobby area and front reception I figured more would be coming.  My surprise and confusion.  Same Ole room and nothing new. Time to maybe try another Marriott/Starwood Hotel in LA.;2
Four Points hotels are a mixed bag in general, and the Four Points near LAX is itself a mixed bag. Before I begin, let me state that the service was excellent, the hotel has surprising in-hotel services that are excellent, and I'd definitely stay here again. On the other hand, with so many hotels in the area to choose from, there's not a lot of reason to select this one unless it's much less expensive.  The layout of the lobby is a bit confusing. When you work in, there is a staffed service desk but it's not the registration desk. The registration desk cannot be seen from the entry. Not a big deal, but the staff at the first service desk clearly don't like directing people to registration. Registration was very busy but the staff were friendly and efficient, and really wanted to;3
My room, despite being on the club floor,  was in need of a complete refurbishment, tears in the carpet, dirty net curtains, stain and dents in the walls  all of which give a shabby impression that you might expect in an old roadside motel but not a Starwood/Marriott property.Had to wait in long line to check in even at the SPG preferred guest desk. Dinner at the bar was quite good.;2
After travelling from Australia on the long haul it was really nice to arrive at the Four Points by Sheraton, arriving at the hotel on the complimentary shuttle I was greeted by the doorman who took my bags and all I had to do was book in and go to my room. The room was comfortable and clean and I got a great nights sleep.  The Four Points by Sheraton is located right next to the car rental businesses so I was able to walk to get my rental and head back to the hotel to get my bags. All in all a great start to my holidays  Thank you To the crew who made my stay a pleasant one;4
Have been here at the Four Points Sheraton on Airport Blvd in Los Angeles for more than 2 weeks. Not very Impressed. The rooms have no safety deposit boxes, no microwaves, and no Refrigerators. Untill yesterday the room did not have a clock untill I asked for one. I asked for a refrigerator and they are charging 11 dollars more a night for the fridge. The wifi connection will not stay connected. Must constantly sign back in. Parking is 29 dollars extra each night. I must say the staff is very friendly and nice. I wanted to do Laundy and they only have 2 washing machines and 2 dryers one of which has been broken since I got here. I have eaten at the breakfast bar and it was ok. Nothing Special. Had lunch at the Brewsters Beererie and the California Burger was nice. Location is;2
I had called and made a reservation after deciding I did not want to spend the night at the airport.   The person making my reservation was great and searched for the best rate.  Upon arriving, the reception staff was friendly and helpful.  The front desk helped me to get pop from a small area that appeared closed for the night.   The bed was comfortable and the shower just the right temperature.  I didn't bother with television or internet.  The room was clean.   The restaurant provided a buffet or off the menu for breakfast.  My food was good and quantity was large. I would definitely go back.;5
We were expecting much more in a Sheraton. We stayed at LAX to catch a plane the following morning. We used the park and fly option. This hotel is dated, in need of numerous upgrades. Even the hallway carpeting looks old. The room was spacious, but contained only the minimal essentials. The windows opened, but were difficult to operate from corrosion. We ate in the bar, the food was good and the service was outstanding. I suspect this hotel was a much better value a decade ago, now there are much better options at LAX.;3
i didn't get to see too much about this hotel because we got back from a cruise and we had a late night flight back home so we rented a room so we could put our feet up and take a shower, and to basically store our luggage while we did a bit of los angeles sight seeing. We got off our cruise ship at about 8 am and we knew we wouldn't have a room ready for us, but i decided to try anyway, because the very least i was gonna ask them to store our luggage. upon arrival i explained the situation to the front desk clerk and i told him we wasn't going to sleep and we had children, if it was possible to have a room, any room in the morning. the Gentlemen was more than helpful to get us a room, he told me to wait about 10 minutes and got us a room with two double bed. i was able to see;4
After flight delay due to bad weather, and other circumstances I found myself stranded at LAX. I was issued with a complimentaty Hotel Authorisation Voucher from the airlines for a one-night stay at this hotel. I overheard the ticketing agent making the arrangements. On arrival well after 10 pm, a very unhelpful front desk attendant and according to him the Supervisor and Manager, claimed not to have received any such call and they all refused to even check with the airline in question despite my request and having presented the authorised voucher.. Having no choice I ended up having to pay for my accommodation. Very surprised I however, remained calm and did what was necessary to ensure safe and restful accommodation. The room was comfortable.  I had 2 large suitcases along;1
If you have to travel for a day its a good option. free shuttle from/to the airport . The free wifi wasn't great. It got disconnected everytime I didnt use it and had to reconnect. Free two bottles of water for spg members. If you have some hours to kill I recommend to go to manhattan beach and go shopping.;3
"I'd been in the LAX area several times for years now, & had enjoyed Brewster's regularly. The lobby & pool area seemed nice enough, so I decided to give them a try.  Sadly, the shine came off the apple shortly after check-in. The room was warm, so we turned the AC temperature down. I did my usual bedbug check, sheets & towels looked clean. Came back later that night & it was just as warm as it was. I called the front desk a couple times & it just rang and rang for a minute or more. I called the operator (who said she was the ""front desk"" too, not sure if that's true--I think her name was Vanessa?), who said it was a problem throughout the hotel, & moving us to a different room wouldn't make a difference. I didn't think hotels with individual thermostats had central air, but";2
Mr. Juan Vasquez was very adamant about finding my husband I a room at the four points LAX. We were celebrating our 60th birthday and on our way  to Hawaii . Our first room didn't work and then he moved us to another we wasn't happy there either. He then mention that the hotel would be going through a renovation soon. We then sat in the lobby waiting for them to clean our room. I just wanted to change our hotel for the duration of our stay, But little did we know Mr. Vasquez was looking for us another room while we were sitting in the lobby. We were so happy with our new room and happier that  Mr. Juan Vasquez never stop trying to accommodating us. So we give Mr.J.Vasquez 10 for outstanding customer service.;4
The hotel was beautiful.  Check in was easy.   The hotel is right on the airport so the scenery is basic.  The room was clean and well made.  The one hitch is that the curtains did not completely block out the bright fluorescent lights from outside of the room.  This made it a bit hard to fall asleep right away.  I guess it could be a separate review but the bar and grill downstairs was great.  Awesome food and good beers on tap.   Oswaldo does a nice job down there.;4
Great location -very close to LAX their super friendly staff helps, got in late to fly out early the next morning. We were greeted by Mantha E. she was so sweet getting us checked in and then a quick pit stop in the nearby bar ! Room is as you would expect from a Four Points, comfy bed etc. Parking was easy and convenient to  rooms and there was plenty of spots the night we checked in.... The van service took about 20 mins. to do the round trip for picking us when we got back.;5
We stayed at the hotel overnight before flying out the following morning.  The hotel is a typical airport hotel.  We had a reasonable rate due to the AAA membership.   Check in was quick.  We ate at the hotel restaurant for dinner which was typical food -- happy hour pricing from 5 to 7.;3
"I came in from the airport and was greeted by a friendly smile, thorough directions, and overall helpfulness. (Thanks, Johnny!) He also recommended the Wednesday evening free sample tasting which I wouldn't have known about otherwise.   Definitely thankful for his greetings on arrival.    I also ordered dinner from the hotel (rye sandwich and the chocolate lava cake) and LOVED it. So good; so worth it. Maybe because I'm back in America after a long time without western food, but recalling it now is making my mouth water. So good.    Great distance from the airport. If you're not hauling luggage, you can walk it no problem.  I'll definitely be coming back to Four Points by Sheraton if I'm ever stranded at the airport again. Staying the night at this hotel was a major stress";5
At $29 per night for parking you would think they would have parking.  But they don't!!!!  We circled the lot 3 times and finally found someone leaving.  We asked for help from customer service which was useless.  They said they have an event that would be leaving soon, but I am watching at least 5 other cars circle as I write these review.  They also block off part of the lot for rental cars.  This is a disaster and I will never stay here again.;1
So overall if you don't expect the ritz, you'll be fine.  The shuttle driver was great, check in was smooth, and I was recognized as SPG platinum member with some extra perks.  I think they are working on a remodel (needed) and I wouldn't hesitate to return.;4
Nice room, very helpful and courteous staff, reliable and helpful shuttle service.  Because of location airplane noise is noticeable. The location is strictly commercial, so there is little to no walkability.;4
The hotel is very close to LAX, offers a free 24 shuttle to and from the airport.  This hotel offers a day suite option for travellers stuck between flights. Hotel is older but well maintained and the rooms are clean.;4
This hotel is among the myriad of hotels next to the airport. Drawbacks were the location and lack of shopping and restaurants in the area. Still we were there for a brief stay before boarding a cruise ship and it served our purpose well. Our room was clean and spacious. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast and our dinner in the bar was good. Reasonably priced. We would stay again;4
Check in was smooth but got to room and it stunk like fish.   Went back down to change rooms and they weren't overly thrilled to have to change us.   2nd room much better until we were woken at 3am to the sound of the radio from next door and a couple having... a good time.  Sounded like they were in the same room as us.  You can hear everything from neighbouring rooms as the walls are paper thin.  Not the place to stay if you are looking for a quiet night.;2
It's a good hotel for transit but it is far away from any tourist attraction areas. We rented a car and it was quite convenient for us to get around. The interior is very 90's and the service is very friendly. We had a pleasant stay.;3
24 hour shuttle from LAX to hotel every 20-30 minutes.  Stunning lobby with lit up pool behind computer station.  Made reservation frim baggage claim on cell phone and timing perfect for shuttle pickup since was 57 degrees F.    Room 365 was large with 2 comfy queen beds, good size bathroom.  Very clean.  Location close to airport but we were told no restaurants in walking distance so we ate in the hotel.  Our service was prompt and efficient. The grilled shrimp cocktail was scrumptious.  Based on my ribs, I would pass on that selection.;4
We stayed here 23rd to 25th November'2016. It was in the airport area but downtown is also not very far from the hotel. Lyft and Uber taxis were available. Hotel was clean and noise free. Prices are very reasonable. Unlike other airport hotels, it is very far distance from city to go to tour;5
I made a last minute reservation to avoid the long drive to LAX and with that came a hefty $ rate for the night.  Parking - I did the park and fly option.  Parking was easy, plenty of available spaces.  Spaces were in an outside lot however they are in the hotel parking lot and not an external lot as some other hotels do.  Check in - Good, A staff member popped out from behind a door to check me in which was really nice to see an attentive and friendly staff member.  Check in was quick and painless :)  Room:  King Bed Deluxe, The room was a nice size for 2 with basic but useful amenities including a desk/drawer area, coffee filter machine which coffee and tea bags, a bottle of water for SPG Preferred guests only (I hate this! It's water... if you can't offer guests free water;3
Stayed here more than a year ago and came back so that we could get a 24 hour room and were very happy. After an overnight flight from Oz we slept from 8:00 for three hours and suitable rested went out for the rest of the day. Even in the morning the hotel was quiet and we slept well.  The check in was efficient and friendly, much better than out last encounter, and we were quickly off to our room.  Room was big and the beds very comfortable.  Wifi was fast and free.  Will stay here again soon as it is great for a 24 hour period between flights and provides a great service.  Parking is expensive.;5
Comfy room but really a disappointing stay.  Attempted to get an airport shuttle pickup.  Website says every 20 minutes, called at 25 minutes agent said no it's 20 to 30 minutes.  Waited until after 35 minutes and another hotel driver came by for the second time and noticed how long I had been in the cold and asked which hotel, so I told him and he was nice enough to bring me to the Four Points for free!  (I wish I had stayed at his hotel).  Things missing in the room but better to go to the desk and ask instead of expecting them to bring it.  Even so I waited 35 minutes in the lobby for them to get a replacement item.  Breakfast is way overpriced at $21+.  Four points had some salesperson sell them a cool idea to stop giving bath essentials like soap, shampoo, etc and instead;3
3 1/2 stars might be more accurate, but this hotel served our purpose of an inexpensive  one night stay near LAX with car rental (USave) on site.  The room was good sized, quiet, clean, and the bed very comfortable.  Bathroom was clean and adequate even if the door would not stay closed.  View was of the parking lot but didn't care.  Did not use the restaurant or bar but they looked acceptable as well.  Parking is pricey at $25 or so per night but we didn't need it as we turned in our rental car there and took their free shuttle to the airport in the morning.  All in all, a very satisfying stay for our needs.;4
"I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the AVIS car rental location at LAX.  Overall, it was a decent hotel. I stayed here two nights, one night on either end of a week long trip. I did not utilize the parking nor did I eat at the restaurant. The room was large and both times I was given the ADA room as an ""upgrade"". Surprisingly quiet given the location so close to the airport runways. Nice that they provide at least two bottles of water. It was clean and decent. I might stay here again if my first choice hotel is booking out as too expensive but this would not be my first choice by any means. Staff is pleasant. OH, here's a tip. Make sure you hop on the right shuttle. I mistakenly hopped on the Sheraton Gateway shuttle (two long walking blocks away down dark streets).";3
Stayed here for 1 night before our morning flight out of LAX. We booked the hotel through the Sheraton (Starwood) website and we purposely booked a Deluxe 2 Queen room which is a higher room than their Traditional room as we wanted a bit more space and comfort.  We checked in and the room was dated, small, the view was of the car park (the view didn't really bother us) but there was missing furnishings like a couch/chair and lamp. The walls are very thin too so you can hear your neighbours showering and closing the door etc.  Phoned Reservations after 20 mins of trying to reach the Front Desk as they were not answering the phone. A lady name Jo from Customer Care confirmed there was no mistake, we are booked in the deluxe room and maybe the chair was removed due to a previous;1
I was very disappointed with this hotel. The lobby was nice and the staff was very friendly, no complaints about them. The rooms were very run down, paint was peeling off and windows were dirty. The carpet in the room didn't appear to be vaccumed. It's amazing how inconsistent this chain is, we were at an amazing property in Seoul and an extreme opposite in LA.;2
This is hardly what one would expect from a FOUR POINTS SHERATON. Checked in - nice lobby area.  Room is stark white and needs a serious update.  There is one lonely picture on the wall.  Bathroom light does not turn off so have to keep the door shut at night.  There isn't a pen or piece of paper in the room to write on.  Parking is $29 a day - you park or $39 a day for valet.  The shower is terrible - barely any water comes out and the bathtub hardly drained so I stood ankle deep while I had a shower in water.  Hair in the shower from previous guest.  Wi-Fi was not good - kept getting booted off from my iPhone and my Mac laptop.  Called the front desk and they put me through to internet service person.  He got me on a different Wi-Fi (LAX) which was slightly better but still;2
One night on arriving in LA left us disappointed. Expensive parking, room and drinks were the reasons and the hotel is overall in need of modernisation. Swimming pool was out of order and no credit given though requested;2
We stayed from Thursday to Monday. The first couple of nights, we noticed that the room was cold - very cold. The heater didn't work, the phone didn't work, the faucet in the bathroom didn't work, and hair dryer, which we use to warm up the bathroom, didn't go about the low setting. So, we got another room. The first night in that room we noticed that the floor was damp. Naively, we thought it was because they had freshly shampooed the carpet. It wasn't. It was because it had been been raining and the windows leaked. The next day  when I came back to the room, I noticed the towels on the air conditioning unit to absorb moisture--a lot of moisture. In fact, I pulled the curtain aside I noticed that rain was pouring both outside AND inside the room. So we got another room, which;2
My wife and I have stayed at this hotel several times. It's much quieter than the hotels on century Blvd. ( don't hear the airplanes taking off). Food and accommodations are good as is the price . Easy check in an check out and a shuttle to the airport. If you rented a car on your trip to LA, Avis, and Alamo bring you directly to the hotel. We love it .;5
I cannot believe this is a Sheraton. Its old and dilapidated. It reminds you of an old run down motel. The front desk staff was nice, the bartender at the restaurant sucked. I can't understand why it has the rating that it has. It should be classified in the catergory of a motel 6. The rooms are old looking and has very cheap furniture. I think the only newer thing in the room was the television. I was only here for one night and I will say that it was clean but they will never see me in that place again.;2
Very nice hotel. The personal was very nice and the rooms was good. The beds was amazing and confortable, one of the best sleep i has had. I can recomend this hotel if you need somewhere close to the airport to sleep;5
We wife and two teenage girls stayed over for 3 nights before coming back to Australia. We booked 4 nights but the last night was a late flight so we only used it for showers ect before departing to LAX. I have mixed feelings about the hotel. My initially feeling was one of  dissapointment as there was a big crowd in the foyer entrance, lots of smokers outside the entrance, the place looks drab from the outside and even worse from the rear car park entrance. To be fair despite the crowd, and after a very short wait, I was checked in by a very polite member of staff. The staff member even took it upon herself to reactivate an old membership, which was nice.  Now for the rooms? Ok, if youre expecting Sheraton style rooms then forget it -The rooms are old with dated decor. Our;3
Stayed here for a 2 night stay on my way home to Australia from US/Canada. Price was good so thought why not.   Check in process was pretty quick, it is an airport hotel. The rooms are much older than the pictures of the lobby would have you believe. We were placed on the 2nd floor looking over the carpark. I did not come here for the view so didn't mind, but the place just generally smelled old.   The room was in a poor state when we arrived. Walls pretty dirty that kind of stuff. Bed was comfy and we were tired so didn't make any fuss.   We were woken at 530am by the fire alarm. The speaker in the room did not function properly so all we heard was crackling, nevertheless, other guests told us that it was a false alarm and we were about to check out anyway.  I wouldn't stay;2
My wife and I are just back from a 3 night long weekend stay at the Four Points by Sheraton at LAX. It is a 4 star property that we booked via Booking.com for a 3 or even 2 star price. The property is minutes from the baggage claim area and there is a complimentary shuttle. Staff is knowledgable and friendly. The hotel itself is older but the lobby / rooms have recently been stylishly updated. There is a restaurant, bar, pool on the premises. Just across the street is Budget rent a car and a small well stocked liquor store where we picked up a bottle of wine for the room (the bartended pulled the cork and gave us proper glasses to take to the room.   One early morning, the fire alarm sounded, sending confused and afraid travelers scrambling to get out of bed and think through;4
We had a twelve hour layover on our way into LA and a twenty-six hour layover on our way out of LA. We chose this hotel based on last years experience and have nothing but good things to say about 4 Points LAX. The check-in is prompt, the staff is efficient and friendly. The rooms are a little dated but clean and comfortable, and that is all we ask. We will be back here again this year.;4
Great location, very close to the airport  free shuttle bus every 15 minutes to the airport  Friendly staff nice restaurant and close to other food outlets  With food delivery from other hotels  Rooms are basic with only the basic style furniture in there  But you pay for what you get  Very reasonably priced  And most time you can check in early if rooms are available  They will also hold luggage for you if you are returning back to stay and want to travel light for your travel around he US;3
I needed a hotel for overnight stay before my flight back home at LAX. So I randomly chose Four Points by Sheraton, as I hope this hotel chain offer me a good experience.   When I arrive at the hotel at the lobby it was actually fine, it is far than the luxury, it was ok since it is Four Points. But when I get to my room, it was not as i expected. I feel this is more like motel than a hotel.   My room was a twin single bed, size is small, funitures were worn out, bathroom is small as well and the hinges of the door is rusty. I could chose a better hotel than this, even it is only for 1 night.   And to check out, it was very long to wait person in front of me.;2
What a dump. Use only as a last resort at LAX. Fire alarm went off at 6 AM with no explanation whatsoever... avoid at all costs! Room was 80s relic complete with antiquated shower. They try to charge same prices as surrounding properties but sub par!!;1
We were looking for a place to stay overnight near the airport so we wouldn't have to deal with traffic on the way to the airport in the morning. We used hotwire, so we got this place at random. It's perfectly adequate for an airport hotel. It's actually designed more like an indoor motel, with a large window in your room facing the hallway. That part is a little weird, and you need to keep your shades closed at all times unless you want everyone walking down the hallway looking all in your room. The doors slamming closed every time someone entered the hallway were loud and annoying. Otherwise it was a basic hotel with nothing special to it. I wouldn't stay here if I wasn't catching a flight, but for that it was fine.;3
Heat didn't work in our room (kids were 1/2 asleep by the time I realized it wasn't working), lots of door slamming at all hours, chaos boarding the very full airport shuttle in the morning.  Not a great experience.  At the least, they need to have a system in place for loading the shuttle.  For example, we waited in line and placed our bags in the back.  When we went to board, all the seats were taken--yet our bags were loaded.;2
Very nice hotel for a reasonable price. I definetly recommend it. Nice, spacious rooms, good WiFi, small clean bathroom , comfortable bed. Very nice and helpful staff. I will definetly come back there :);5
My whole experience at Four Points LAX can accurately be summed up as disappointment after disappointment, especially after my good experiences with other Four Points hotels. The good: room service meals were of high quality (even at midnight), the rooms were spacious (upgraded to king suite) and the beds were very comfortable. The bad: arrived at 11pm with long queue after flights were cancelled at LAX, managed to finally get into priority queue with Gold status, got given room. Wheeled all my luggage upstairs, opened the door to find it was filthy and hadn't been cleaned. Called the front desk and was told to go back downstairs. So wheeled all my luggage back downstairs and got back into queue. The ugly: When I was finally given the right room, the overwhelming smell as I;2
While the location is convenient, this property is very dated and doesn't have the nicer amenities as do some nearby properties. Of course there price is often very competitive as well.  Transportation to and from the airport is a nice amenity however give yourself plenty of time to departure time of flights as traffic can easily add an unforeseen 30 minute wait. If you don't have much luggage you can make the walk.  Check in desk is typically understaffed for busy check in times and Starwood gold/platinum line is nonexistent.;3
Checked in for one night en route with a little trepidation after reading some of the reviews. No problems with the front desk staff who were cheerful and helpful. The room was quiet, clean and tidy with two enormous beds. The courtesy bus from the airport arrived within ten minutes but that may just have been our good luck. The trip back to LAX was efficient. All in all a good result all around.;4
"We walked in to ask for the rate of the room for that night which was 149$, we packed our things and came to check in and the same clerk started to check us in took our credit card first then proceeded to tell us ""oh by the way the rate has changed since we last spoke it is now 165$"" Basically tricked us into booking the room at a rate after we had walked in with all of our stuff and given them our card. The room was underfurnished,no plugs next to the bedside tables. The bed had a flat sheet instead of a fitted sheet on the mattress which came off during the night, pieces of walls that had been patched. Overall a very disappointing stay.";1
This was an overnight stay after flying to LAX. First the positives. The airport shuttle was prompt, nice comfortable shuttle and great service from the driver. Check in was fast and efficient. Now the negatives. This hotel is tired and badly in need of renovating. Hallway carpets are worn and stained. Our small room smelled musty. Beds very uncomfortable with sheets that needed replacing as they showed their age. Small bathroom with no soap other than gel in the bathtub shower. No note paper or pens in the room. Stay away until this hotel is renovated. Certainly not worth the high price we paid for our room.;2

We stayed here from Dec 29 through Jan 3 ,2017 as we were in town for the Rose parade and Rose Bowl.The king room was spacious , the carpet was old and there were stains on the walls.The bed was clean and comfortable and thank God for the thick comforter.There was  no safe or microwave. We were there for 5 nights during a cold snap of highs in the 50s. But our heat didn't work! We called the desk nightly to report no heat but no one ever answered.Finally on the last night we went to front desk and told them we had no heat and were freezing! My parents were in room across the hall and also were freezing! We were informed that they were aware of problem and that heat had been out all week!  They never told us this or that we could have moved to a room with heat!!Our room was 62;2
I was staying in this hotel for two days and really like it. They have a large and comfortable room. It was also very clean. The staff were really helpful and responsive. But they do not have a microwave in the room. We need to go to the hotel microwave on first floor. The wifi was not really good. They do not provide free breakfast. But overall I had a great experience in this hotel.;5
We had a quick overnight layover at LAX, and we decided to stay at this hotel since it was relatively close to the airport.  After landing at 2AM along with thousands of other passengers, we had to wait for the hotel shuttle for a very long time.  Once we got on, the shuttle was full, and no more people could get on.  I felt bad for the people at Terminals 6 and 7 who had to wait for a shuttle with available seats.  Check in was quick and friendly, and we were offered a complimentary breakfast (which we didn't use because we were running late).  The room was a good size, except the restroom seemed pretty small and narrow.  There were a few hairs in the shower that disgusted me, and the curtains were stained badly.  Also the bed sheets were too small for the bed, so our feet were;3
After getting to to the shuttle area we only had to wait 5 minutes for the free shuttle direct to the hotel. Our room was alright without being exceptional, but we only wanted the hotel for a layover, and it was perfect for that. Great if you're only transiting through LA, but i imagine theres better places to stay if you're doing anything in the city.;3
We didn't like this hotel at all! Luckily it was only one night and we arrived late and leaved very early...  - the room didn't had a window, only one to the corridor  - it smelled very humid  - carpet was dirty  - tiny bedroom   I wouldn't recommend  it !;1
We stayed last year and in a way you have certain expectations when it comes to the hotel and services. Last year we felt very welcome because of the way they treated us upon arrival they did an exceptional job and the room or tower they put us on was great. This time a year later in our opinion the service was even better welcome us congratulated us for our anniversary did many small little things that they didn't have to but made the service stand out I think every staff member we encounter was friendly pleasant and very welcoming.  I would have to agree with some of the reviews maybe it's time for some remodeling or at least new mattresses and pillows.   If you drive a car be ready to pay 29 self 40 valet;3
This hotel did not hit the mark for what was expected of a Sheraton Hotel.  We stayed here on Christmas night and again on New Years Eve with a reservation for two rooms both times.  We were in different rooms each time, but on the same floor in the East Tower.  To start, the smell in the room was unacceptable.  Although we requested a different tower for the second time, we were denied as they said all other rooms were booked.  In one of the rooms, the vent over the bathroom sink was leaking a lot of water, causing a slip hazard, which was ignored when brought to the attention of the front desk.  There was no way to adjust the heat in either room, so you were at the mercy of what they deemed was the acceptable heat level.  In the bathroom, the showers did not work unless the;2
I just completed another overnight stay here and had once again a pleasant experience. The staff are courteous and willing to go out of their way. In my case, they nicely let me have a late check-out beyond the normal amount to help minimize the gap until my flight. The shuttle service is efficient and the hotel is close to a fast rood restaurant, cafe, and grocery store if you need something lite. I will stay here again!;5
I was put here for an interview in LA. I rejected the company partially because their cheap decision to put me here. bedsheet with stains, intolerable noise and housekeeper's loud laughter from the next room (like a tractor or something, even vacuum is better). everything was done in a minimal style. the body wash and soap were hung on the wall just like the locker room. housekeeper was trying to enter to 'clean' the room right after I checked in. made me think that the room wasn't cleaned at all. no restaurant, just a sports bar.;1
We spent a night in the West tower and it is a complete dump!!!! The beds were lumpy with very wrinkles comforters and the carpet and side chair had stains all over them! There was a portable closet (piece of furniture) that was all beat-up and looked like it came from a garage sale from someones basement from 50 years ago. The bathtub, shower, and tile floor were so very old! The thermostat showed 72 degrees but it was hot and the air did not work. The fan barely worked on a very slow speed and got louder through the night with a high pitched noise like it was on its last leg. We finally turned it off. After taking a shower in the room, it was very humid and you couldn't do anything about it. Also, all the rooms in this tower look like they were once outdoor rooms, with the;2
Got laid over in LA gor two days but I found this place online for $82 a night. The room was nice big and clean, and Martha E. at the front desk was amazing, she made sure we were taken care of the entire two days. If I ever have the misfortune of getting laid over again in LA I know where I will stay. Thank you;5
Seriously???  They pick you up in a nice Mercedes black sprinter.....(once the driver decides he goes off a does whatever he does for an hour or hour and a half.......front desk says he is on the way.....but he apparently likes to make a pit stop?) They take you to a pretty decent lobby area and then BAM....Send you off to your fly by night, outdated, carpet & chair stained, wrinkled bed, non working a/c, second hand store furniture, 1955 bathtub, talk to your neighbors next door through the wall, 19 inch television set room.  -----I have stayed at Sheraton gateway 2 blocks down........do yourself a favor, stay there.   One word describes this place.......RUN!  From Run down to Runaway as fast as you can.;1
The room was decent, genuine customer service and spacious. Wifi wasn't working but there was cable so it didn't bother me at all. Also the lobby was very welcoming, felt like a living or lounge which was awesome.;4
We often spend our last night by Los Angeles international Airport before returning home. One of our preferred hotel is the Foir Points by Sheraton. Simple and clean. Staff are always professional and price moderate. Rooms needs some improvement, but for a very short stay it can be good;3
After 30 days travel throughout Europe, staying in hotels whose buildings were sometimes over 600 years old,  and beibg amazed at every stay, it was DISGUSTING to spend our last night at this Sheraton Four Points LAX. The room was way beyond need of full reconditioning as were, all the public areas. Priceline rates this hotel 3.5 stars which is why I no longer book through there site. Room was dirty, sheets dirty, bath room mirror broke, loose tiles. I have stayed in Motel 6 that were cleaner and far better maintained. They, like many LAX hotels take advantage of the fact that most visitors stay one quick night and just deal with the poor value and poor conditions.  Never a Sheraton of any type for us.;1
I stayed one night at this hotel. It is starting to show its age. Old fixtures. Could use a coat of paint. Impressed that they are environmentally friendly and do not have the tiny bathroom bottles of shampoo etc. The price was low and you just basically get what you pay for. I rated two but only because I have stayed in some amazing hotels. This one met my expectations.;2
The hotel is very convenient for a close to airport property.  (There is a free shuttle)  The hotel is a bit dated, but is very clean.  This feels like a safe hotel and there was no issue with the sound of the airport.  On the downside the parking is expensive ($30.00 a day);3
Due to flight schedule I needed to overnight in LA so selected somewhere near the airport. I selected this hotel purely because of the name 'Sheraton'. This turned out to be a mistake. My room had no direct windows to the outside, the only windows were looking into a corridor so I had little choice but to have the curtains closed or people walking past could see into the room. The room was very dated. Under the beds, behind the tv hadn't been dusted or vacuumed for a long time. There are no safes in the rooms and you have to put valuables at the front desk, which they charge for. I went out for a few hours returned to the room at 10.30pm and my room was like a sauna, I rang reception and they informed me that the people in the neighbouring room were cold so they pumped up the;2
This is so far the WORST Four Points experience, and being Gold SPG Member, I've seen a lot of Starwood properties, including quite serviceable Four Points. Service, staff,  and parking situation killed it for me. Stayed there one night on business before morning flight from LAX. Rented the car, and problems started immediately upon arrival.  First:  they have a nerve to charge almost $32 per day for this horrible parking! Front desk rep was pleasant, but forgot to give the parking ticket to me with in/out priveleges. Couldn't get out while going to meeting, , so had to park, walk back to reception, and get it! Waste of time: terrible! Then in the evening, coming back around 9:30 pm, no parking spaces at all, another 15 mins lost. The parking is poorly designed and managed.;1
Curt, welfare-office attitude at the front desk.  Unconcerned, uncaring, dismissive, weary.  Room early Motel 6, without the crisp cleanliness and bargain prices.  Door scarred and in dire need of paint....in fact entire room needed paint.  Furniture scratched, gouged and dented.  Noisy.  Lack of amenities in bathroom.  Parking lot cannot accommodate the number of cars they sell parking to.  It was  just a horrible experience.   Never again.;1
Four points Sheraton  Cleanliness  This hotel is clean, the rooms however are a bit tired and need trained staff to clean them, so many areas lacking attention(i put this down to it being a transit/ airport hotel)  Noise levels  The noise levels as fine as long as neighbouring rooms abide by the rules   Value for money  The cost of this hotel was ok  Hospitality  The staff were receptive and helpful when needed  Location  This hotel was a perfect stop of for my family prior to driving to San franscisco and prior to flying to Hawaii (couldn't be bothered staying on the I 5 (LA's biggest car park)  on arrival or departure from the USA. The hotel  restauarant has real good staff and good food. This hotel is conveniently located one block form the hire car hub and it also offers;3
The Hotel is average and the rooms aren't that great. Room size is ok (not very big, neither small). Decor is ok and the bathroom n eeds a total makeover. At 160 USD per night i could have got better hotels in LAX. If you just need a shower and keep moving, this is ok, but i wouldn't recommend this hotel as a great relaxation place with family. Also the city and all other attractions such as the Hollywood Boulevard & Dolby Theater is quite far away from this hotel.;3
Not the Sheraton or Four Points experience I am used to.  Rooms were very old and worn.  Looked like it has not been updated since the late 80's early 90's.  Bathtub/shower did not drain well so it backed up over 6 inches even with a quick shower.  Wi-Fi repeatedly disconnected so I had to burn my cell data plan to do any work.  Bright spot was the bed was clean.;2
Hotel was comfortable and very close to the airport. Have to commend Johnny V. Who checked us in, superior service. Staff was very nice. Food in the grill was excellent. For being so close to the airport, traffic noise was not overwhelming.  Thank you Johnny for your superior service.;4
This was an average hotel, okay for a layover while at LAX. The staff was nice, but the room was definitely not worth the price. I know that you are paying for location, but the wallpaper was peeling, the room smelled musty, and the shower head was super low, that you have to duck to get under the water.;3
Checked in after a long drive. Turned in rental car and was easy walk back to hotel. Found hotel to be clean and staff was friendly and helpful. They were having problems with internet and was given two wi-fi address and was able to connect on second wi-fi. Got in late so did not use amenities. Slept well and had an uneventful transfer to LAX.;4
"The only reason to stay at this hotel is if you are flying out of LAX. It's close to nothing of interest and no walkable restaurants nearby.  We stayed here for the ""Park and Fly""  which offers one night stay and up to 14 nights of parking for one fee.  You are entitled to take the hotel shuttle to the airport, a short 5 minute trip from the hotel, for no additional cost. Upon your return you grab the shuttle again, back to the hotel and pick up your car.  There are lots of hotels in the immediate vicinity of LAX doing the same, and all charge about the same rate. All of them are big, busy and homely hotels and all of them circulate huge numbers of people thru their doors 24 hours a day. For what it's worth, my room at the Four Points was clean (if dated) had working air";3
Recently, my wife and I stayed the evening at this hotel prior to traveling to Chicago the following morning.  Excellent location with shuttle service every 20 minutes to the LAX Terminals.  Hotel offers many services including an outdoor pool bar and restaurant.  Rooms are comfortable  and well appointed although the bathrooms are a bit small. We have stayed here many times in the past and will do so in the future.  On site parking is available but is a bit expensive in my opinion.;4
"Booked a 2 night stay here as a ""trouble free"" end to a three week holiday. Somewhere close to the airport. Location is great.   The issues started at checkin, we were advised that the booking was for only one night and as it had been prepaid they were unable to extend it, fortunately I had all the documents on hand to prove I had paid for 2 nights. Eventually the staff member extended our stay for the prepaid 2 nights, stating that the back office would sort it out.   All seemed fine, the next day we went out shopping and on return our keys wouldn't open the door to the room! Another trip to reception and speaking to a male staff member who asked if we were checking out today, advised no and that it was a 2 day booking. Appears the initial staff member made a note on the";1
"Normally, this isn’t how I would start a hotel review, but hey, what airport hotel serves Orval Trappist beer and at only a 50% premium on its normal bar price? Not bad at all, not bad at all. We’re off to a good start if they’ve got Orval, Duval, Firestone, and so on. That said, you better have a thick Texas roll in your pocket if you want to have lunch or dinner in the restaurant, even if it is pretty tasty for a hotel restaurant (the fish and chips were nicely done, at least for me). They know they’ve got you because you’re not walking the flight long blocks to the In ’n Out at 9:30pm on a Friday night; on the other hand, it seemed to be that some folks from Australia had their Orvals and then ordered some awesome-smelling Indian food for delivery from around here somewhere.";4
The lobby, pool, restaurant and ameneties of this hotel are very good. The public areas of the hotel are quite attractive. I don't know about all the rooms but ours was quite tired and in need of an upgrade. The windows could use replacing they were fairly flimsy and definitely didn't muffle the sound of the planes much. The bed was very comfortable though and the room did the trick for an ovenight stay. All the staff were very helpful and friendly so I would recommend the hotel for sure.;3
You know, it just might be that I'm getting spoiled going to countries that have very nice hotels for far less per night.  Maybe most of us living in the US have to suck it up and take the big money hit for far less levels of service amenities and ambience?    I've stayed at a few different four points locations and I've generally been pleased.  The one near MSP is particularly top notch.  I've given them a rave review.  Thinking that extended to LA, I gave my SPG a workout.    My stay wasn't bad, nothing was awful, it was just a bit dingy for the asking price.  You could tell the room was a hasty re-do from an older hotel.  The beds were a little too firm for my liking, a previous tenant had pulled the phone cable out of the wall so I had to fix that problem.  The curtains in;3
Decided to break up the long trip from Boston to Melbourne (via Auckland) with an over-nighter in LA. Excellent rating for this Hotel being a great fit for what we needed and the price we paid and how we were treated. We left it late to book, and paid $130 US which I was happy with, but maybe could have got it cheaper if I booked earlier. Not sure. Chose Four Points because of their 24 hour check in / check out where you get a full 24 hours from when you arrive till you have to check out. As we were arriving at 10.00 pm and then flying out at 9.00 pm the next night it would save us the cost of 2 nights accommodation anywhere else. Booked it only to find that deal is only if you spend 2 nights... but requested the 24 hr deal anyway and were given a 5.00 pm checkout, which was;5
I found this hotel through Expedia . They said they had a shuttle service from the airport to the hotel. I called the night before & ask them as how often the shuttle comes ? They replied every 15-20 minutes. We had to wait for an hour and in that time period we saw the shuttle of the other hotels to go by more than 2 times. Once we got to the hotel, nobody to help and the wait line took a long time . The room is really average. 2nd night we were up from 2 am until we left since the people next door made a lot of noise and slammed the door many times . Security showed up at 6:00 am to kick them out. I mentioned it at the front desk and they reimbursed the parking fee. The price quoted by the concierge & the registration for the parking were different . Good things about the;2
An excellent option near the airport. As expected from a Sheraton hotel, the rooms are great, good service and very clean. Love the fact that there were nearby restaurants and walking around there was great. So if you seek an option near the airport, I strongly recommend this great hotel.;5
My wife and I had to find a hotel near LAX. The price was good and the customer service was great. This was very nice after dealing with airline employees most of the day! Monica at the front desk was great and bartender was perfect. Our driver back to the airport was great also . I would recommend this for a quick stay near the airport;4
Havent stayed here in years. Still the same friendly place I remember. Excellent rooms and friendly staff. Some of the staff are people that were there 15-20 years ago when I stayed frequently. Breakfast not included in rate but there is a fast food place across the street.;5
Bathroom door didn't close, carpet was frayed, the very heavy dresser was pulled out away from the wall making a tight room even tighter.  Elevators were a long walk from the front desk.  Dispensers in the shower didn't work.  Lack of maintenance attributable to the sheer size of this hotel probably. Smokers were RIGHT outside the door and unavoidable if you wait for a shuttle, and we did.  On the plus side, if you're renting from Budget car rental, you can turn in your car rental mere steps away and NOT pay valet parking.  The airport shuttle was reliable, the driver exceedingly polite and helpful.;2
"Stayed here one night in November '16. Staff was very attentive. Greeted me as an Honors member and said ""Happy Birthday"" to me. That was a surprise. The room was clean and seemed to have been updated. The bar was open in the evening after the restaurant  was closed. My wife said the fish tacos were excellent. In the morning we had the breakfast buffet which was $21 plus tip. Other choices are available for a little less. Service was good. Food  good. The Budget rent a car lot is right across the street. Very easy. Shuttle service to the LAX is constant most if not all the time. Room rate was average for the area and level of hotel. Around $150 including taxes.  We will be staying here again very soon. Look forward to the same good experience.";5
Room extremely clean, ready when requested, room staff, especially  Este Estrada were very accommodating, courteous and efficient. Breakfast set up on time and cleared away magically and the same with Lunch on all three days. This lady is a credit to the Sheraton on Century Blvd.;5
I stayed here while in town for a conference. Everything downtown was too expensive. Shuttle from airport was quick, restaurant food was decent, and overall the hotel was as expected. I'd stay again if back in town.;5
It's an airport hotel, nobody should be expecting a luxury experience. The hotel was clean, and the airport shuttle was reliable. If you want to walk, it's quite close to LAX. Check in was efficient, and overall, this hotel was a pleasant experience while traveling. The price was very reasonable.;4
"This was a family stay for 3 nights. The location is rather inconvenient if you wanna explore the city. Probably it is good for those who are staying just for 1 night and heading back to the airport. We bought some tours from the hotel so we got all the sightseeing covered. Dining area is rather small. Service was not so great. It took a long time for our bags to be delivered upon arrival. I had to go down to the reception to check on our luggage. Then the room stewards didn't come even though we put a ""service"" sign on the door. As for me its not worth the money. For example we stayed at the same 4 points by Sheraton in Indonesia and it was no comparison. There was even special playground area for kids available in the restaurant and moreover it was even supervised by the hotel";3
We booked this hotel as it was close to airport and this was a one night stay. We usually stay at Embassy Suites but since this was a short sleep over thought we would save a few dollars.  Pros The staff were great. They gave us an early check-in. The bellman in particular was very helpful. The first room they put us in had no AC. He promptly called the front desk and secured another room and moved our bags.   Cons The hotel is in need of a major overhaul. I do not think there has been updating of the rooms for many years. Hallways smelled musty and also smelled of cooked food. Walls were thin, someone next door kept slamming their door all night and it actually rattled our beds. AC worked in the second room but was very temperamental. The window frame is so loose that you can;2
The hotel served its purpose for what I needed, which was to stay one night in LA.  The rooms are old, some of them still have the window ac.   I actually had to switch rooms because the one they had given me originally was one of those rooms with the window ac (It made so much noise and you couldn't change the fan speed).  Also the mini fridge didn't work, so I just ended up asking for a new room. If you need a one night stay then the hotel is ok.  It is clean and has airport shuttle service.;3
We made a one night stay,but had our luggage stored after checkout for a late evening airline departure.This was well done,in a secure room with proper receipts,although we had a half hour wait for the concierge on return to retreive our cases.Return to airport was fast and simple,by free shuttle bus .     The hotel is a big H-plan building amidst a howling wilderness of traffic.Our room was in the centre of the 'H' ,and was oddly arranged.The window opened only into the corridor,which forbids real ventilation and cannot be good for fire safety( there is ,however,a sprinkler system in the rooms and corridor).The side arms of the building have a normal centre corridor with outward facing rooms.    Two queen beds left little space,but there was a reasonable amount of;3
"This stay was one of those ""Need somewhere cheap to stay before an early flight"" situations.     The lobby looks ok, and you can immediately tell this huge hotel is geared towards conferences.  Well, the fun ended there.   The room really had a bad odor to it, think old 1970's casino.  It also looked like the room hadn't been updated since about 1970 either.  Needless to say, it was in dire need of a makeover and about 400 bottles of Febreeze.    A shuttle from another hotel came to take us to the airport as the driver said the driver of the FP Sheraton van was late.   The price was right for the shortness of the stay, but I gladly would have paid a few bucks more for another name brand hotel in the same area.   And there are PLENTY to choose from.  Unfortunately, I can't";2
I booked a last minute room between international flights for somewhere to rest and be refreshed. It was just what I needed! I was especially attracted to Sheraton, Four Points because of the location, free airport shuttle, free WiFi and affordability. The hotel has a restaurant on site and there is a burger King right across the street. In N out burger was just a mile, $5 uber ride away. I used the hotel pool which had a very nice pool deck, and very clean pool facilities. The staff were very helpful and room service was professional and quick. The room itself was basic but clean and everything you could need. I recommend this hotel, especially those who need to be near the airport.;4
Upon arrival I was greeted miserably by the agent and I asked for a quiet room as I was over 15 hours ahead of time from my flight from Asia. The agent insisted it would be. The room overlooked the roof and had two beds. I called to move, was on hold for twenty minutes. Finally got back to phone to say I could move. Was offered to have key delivered, I said ok but then put on hold again to confirm that someone could. This took another 10 minutes by which time I grew impatient and hung up. Waited another ten minutes for a call back or someone to arrive.  Nothing. Got in shower. Banging on the door begun 15 minutes into shower. I yelled to tell them. Came back ten minutes later - just out of shower, in my towel, I told them to forget it.   Room had gross carpeting, aged;2
Came here after been to business meeting in SAN Diego, hotel is located near the airport , it is not exactly modern but good enough for a stop over.  My room had two beds queen size which was ok.  There is a bar downstairs serving drinks and cocktails together with a restaurant.  It is a 3 star hotel and it offers shuttle 24 hour to the airport every 20 minutes.;3
My family of four stayed here for an overnight prior to a flight home from a California trip. They accommodated a late checkout request, staff was friendly, hotel restaurant was good (pricey, however), shuttle was prompt and easy. They impressed us with complimentary treats at the coffee shop after our clumsy two year old accidentally smacked his ear on the counter, a totally unexpected nor necessary gesture! That said...the room was pretty gross. There was dried green mucus on the wall of the bathroom, a smear of what looked like blood on the door, stained and cracked tiles in the bathroom...kinda over the top yuck for a hotel of this rating and price. I'm not sure I'd chose this airport hotel if others are available next time.;3
i liked the hotel!!!! it was not cheap at all, but the shuttles ran every 15 minutes and on time, check in was quick, and staff was nice. rooms were ample and clean. there is a small supermarket close by if you need water or to grab a bite. is is not cheap, but If you are willing to pay it is a good place to stay.;4
I needed a place close to LAX and stayed at the Four Points Sheraton.  They have a 24 hour shuttle service to and from the airport.  Just wait under the Hotel Shuttle signs and a black van comes around about every half hour.  The rooms are basic but clear and quiet.  The hotel has a good location close to the airport.;4
I had an early morning flight, so I chose this because it was a good value and close to the airport.  My room (519) was big, clean and quiet, and the desk staff gave out delicious chocolate chip cookies at check in!  The bed was comfortable, and in the morning, the shuttle ran on time and dropped me right at my terminal.  The hotel was a good value.;4
First impressions look really good in lobby ....then you get to your room , doesn't look like it's been decorated since the place was built . Only had three towels for four people,which were more yellow than white , went down to reception and asked for another and never received it useless .rundown outdated and smells damp!! For that money try another hotel as there are plenty to choose from  very disappointed.;2
"After looking at property after property among our partner alliances, I landed on this hotel.  I was not disappointed, because I wasn't expecting much.  It was a solid option for the price.    For an airport hotel you mainly need convenience and comfort, and this place provided both.   1. It was close to the airport, and literally right across the street from Budget car rental (save your money on the exorbitant parking fees at the hotel and just pick the car up in the morning) 2. The beds and pillows were fantastic...just the way I like them, soft.  If you need more, just ask.   3.  Restaurants on sight.  Surprisingly good!  I had a tasty quinoa salad, and they happened to be having an all ""you could eat"" prime rib buffet that night.  Didn't partake, but it smelled awesome!   I";3
"The check-in can take a while, so be patient.  The staff is very attentive and the manager is ""super"" helpful.  If you have any problems let the staff know and they will correct it if they can.  This is an older property, so don't expect luxury.  The food is good in the dinning room and at the bar.  Again, be patient.  Best part of my stay was the shuttle service to and from LAX!";3
Thanks to the staff members including there management I will NEVER attend this four points again, the front staff miss informed me after a 5h drive and a very long night after arriving here  giving me the run around and basically voluntarily canceling my reservation after a disagreement we had. The staff was very snobby not to mention laughed at the fact I couldn't get my room the manager Lupe decided that the line was to long at 1:30am so she needed to push me aside and felt the need to take care of someone else. Worst hotel ever do not recommend!   If it wasn't for Hony at the four points by Sheraton La west side which is 3miles away from this four points I don't know where I would have stayed now if your looking for a great place to stay visit the four points not this this;1
Stayed here one night to be close to airport. All of the staff I encountered were very nice and helpful. They get a A+ for customer service. My room was average, and certainly fine for a single overnight stay. I did not eat at the hotel, but I did walk the couple of blocks to a sub shop for dinner. The price was very competitive compared to other hotels in the area, and I would stay again.;4
Stayed here for one night for a business conference. Staff was great especially the concierge/bell desk.  They went out of their way to help me with whatever I needed. The room was mediocre.  It was standard.  Sheets were clean but bathroom could have used a little more cleaning.  I didn't have any information about the hotel in my room and did not know they offered room service.;3
After a long flight from Europe, we arrived in LA and went with the Hotel/Airport shuttle to the Four Points by Sheraton.  Our check-in was fast.  Went to the room and found it of a very good size, although a little out-dated.  Breakfast was reasonable. At the end of our tour throughout California, we stayed the last night in another airport hotel and found that the breakfast was even more basic...;3
The shuttle was the best part, the driver Pedro was very nice. On the other hand, the check in was a disaster. The guy sent us to a room with only one bed, our reservation was for 2 beds. I came back and he gave us other room - same problem. Only after 3 tentatives the room was correct. The attendee gave us a Usd 15 coupon to be used in the restaurant, was nice but didn't change my mind regarding the quality of the service.;2
First impressions were good. Friendly staff at check in, one guy took the bags to the room. There was a bar that was open next to reception that looked good but we didn't use it. Rooms were a decent size and comfy beds, maybe a little dated. The bathroom was decent though clean and up to date. Had a good sleep. Breakfast was ok, not fantastic but adequate. Pool was nice, good area and clean. The main problem was the payment. They took a swipe of my credit card for authorisation (which is fine) at the start and then a swipe again at the end to pay (which again is normal) but they took full payment twice. One is an authorisation as I said but if you use a foreign credit card (as most people would at an international airport) that authorisation stays on your credit card statement;3
Its a very nice hotel and well situated for the airport. Rooms are very nice, clean and well maintained but the wifi is very poor infact we could not get anything in the east wing. Even in the bar the wifi was pretty near non existent so would be reluctant to evan recommend.;3
Stayed here 1  night before flying home. The porter brought our bags to the room unloaded them took he trolley out the door came in shut the door saying nothing but obviously waiting for a tip. Gave him a tip but was horrified. Would not stay here agiain;4
Our parents and we were staying at this Hotel in our LA trip. On the second day, there was severe water leakage in the room above our parents’, and their room got impacted as well. There was NOBODY contact us at the first point until we got back and found it out. Our parents’ stuff have been moved around. My husband and I went to the front desk immediately, but the person knew nothing. After he talked to manager, he gave us the key to another room. I’ve asked if there is anything got wet/damaged, whether the hotel would help deal with them. But he said he doesn’t think there is anything got problem. When we went back to the room, Mom told us one of her shoes seems soaked in the water and very wet, and her sleepwear which she put in the bed got badly soaked as well. In addition,;1
We stayed there because of the Sheraton brand. Disappointed because the room was rather small for four sharing it. One bed was right up against the wall so if you had to get out of that side you had to climb over your partner.  Expensive too! Taxes in it amounted to US$170.00. Breakfast was good but expensive too! $30.00 for two plus tip. Concierge told us it was $30 to $35 to take a cab to Marina Del Rey. We took the local big blue bus for $1.25 each way. I am an spg member and only got 593 star points for the stay. My daughter suggested Hotwire and doing a search for a four or five star and see what you get. She said it was much cheaper! She stayed at the Crowne plaza doing this 3 times. Very close to LAX and could hear the planes in the room.;3
First off staff is nice... The bed and bedding are great. AC worked great. All electric wall plugs need replaced. .worn out. Tile on bath floor cracked chipped. Bath door paint worn off. Every time I get discount, they put me crummy room.;2
"The hotel could not get the fire alarm to stop going off at random times. We needed to get some sleep so we moved across the street to the Embassy Suites.  It's an ok place to stay - if they got that problem solved- if you want to park and fly. They have a shuttle to and from the airport. The hotel is older and could use some updating.  I was surprised at how dated it looked. For a ""Sheraton"", I thought it would look nicer.";1
I have stayed at this hotel for one night on two separate occasions. My son was already put up in this hotel as this is the place that the MEPS uses for the kids when they need a place to stay the night before their testing. I got my own room and was really pleased with the amenities. The gym was great for a hotel gym! I plan on working out there on every visit. The pool is great as well. Restaurant was just ok, but worth it if you just want to stay in. Now I'm planning my 3rd stay and a sad but exciting send off for my boy... into the armed forces he goes.;4
Quick facts: Pros: Close to airport, clean room, morning shuttle performance Cons: Late-night shuttle performance, small room, outdated, lack of HVAC control  We spent a night here because of the airline- we took them up on their offer to take a later flights in exchange for a generous travel voucher.  Since we needed a room for the night, the Four Points was what they provided.  It fulfilled the basic requirements of a hotel and not much else- definitely not the kind of place one would stay if expecting more than that.  The airline said that, even late at night, the shuttle comes every seven minutes.  The hotel said that wasn't the case- we had to call after waiting outside the airport for fifteen minutes with other shuttles passing repeatedly with apologetic looks. Someone was;2
It's a really nice facility. My room had a microwave and fridge and was pretty big! The breakfast on the other hand wasn't good at all. It was overpriced (20 bucks a person). I've had better breakfasts at cheap hotels for free. Go somewhere else to eat instead of the buffet breakfast.;4
I waited more than 1 hours for this hotel airport shuttle bus pickup at LAX. During the waiting period, I made 3 calls to ask about the shuttle bus, every time I was told by its customer services that it was coming. Finally they let me take a taxi to the hotel and reimburse me the tax fee. No more business!;1
We stayed at the Four Points for 3 nights and were thoroughly disappointed with the hotel. It is in dire need of an upgrade with power points not working and wall sockets falling off the walls. The rooms were dark with no direct light and smelt damp. The food was below average. The whole place is very tired, they need to invest some serious dollars to bring it up to the lowest Sheraton standard.;2
Experienced a few issues this stay: 1) most annoying, the wifi kept kicking me out at the most inopportune times - like when I was submitting my expense report, downloading files, etc.  I must have re-logged in 15 times in an hour. 2) hot water took 5 minutes to come up to my shower at 5 am - didn't plan on that - hope other pax on my early am flight won't notice. 3) For check-in at 8 pm they had two clerks - a SPG gold/platinum and the masses - something funky was going on with the gold/platinum's computer and he kept having to run down to the last computer to validate parking - it took 20 minutes to check in and there were only 2 guests ahead of me in the queue. 4) Had been waiting 40 min for the shuttle bus which allegedly comes every 30 min.  A neighboring hotel bus driver;3
After the taxi driver dropped us at the wrong Sheraton lol, this was a nice place. Very modern, friendly, had everything there kind of place. Great pool. and the bar was really good with cheap beer and tasty food.   Easy transfer by free shuttle bus in the morning.   An all round good place to stay.;4
"The ""Red Zone"" is where a traveler waits at LAX for his hotel shuttle; the air is thick with diesel fumes, I was tired after fourteen hours in the air and eager to be picked up by the Sheraton shuttle and go to sleep. I called upon arrival and was told they run their van every 20 minute service, so after waiting for 20 minutes I called again and was told ""it will be another ten minutes...the van is coming.""  Fifteen more minutes passed, Hilton and Best Western vans passed by--again and again--but no Sheraton.  When I called for the third time, they said ""the driver is being expressed from Terminal One."" It takes about two minutes to drive from Terminal One to Terminal Six, where I waited for thn more minutes.  On the fourth call, they said ""Take a cab, we'll pay for it."" The";1
We were very disappointed in our stay here. The restaurant was pretty bad. My husband was feeling ill after eating the greasy ribs. Our bed was hard, there was hair in our bathroom and the front desk person had an excuse for everything. NOT what I expect for $200.00. It was our third hotel in the area over our week and by far the worst.;2
Stayed one night, was able to return my car rental and walk back to the hotel. My grandson enjoyed to pool. Our room was as expected but nothing fancy. We had room service for dinner and I do have to say the food was very good and they were very quick in delivering.  We had early morning flight, left at 4:45! Shuttle was timely and friendly. Very quick ride to airport. My biggest problem was the wifi, very slow, we were not able to watch Netflix for the buffering.;4
This hotel was a great find for the long term parking! We had the 21 day package and stayed the night before our flight. The bathroom was clean, hotel well laid out and service was great..many thanks to Cesar for being so helpful! The shuttle was quick, timely and great customer service getting to the airport in the morning Overall the rooms are worn, bed and pillows were decent. I would stay there again.;4
"3½* Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles Airport Complimentary shuttle service to and from airport Friendly staff Happy Hour in the bar area Room are nice; bathrooms are clean I didn’t like the bed; it was too soft";3
Stayed for 2 nights. Easy to get to this hotel from airport. Easy to go to down town LA. Not so easy going to my room though. While staying there one of the elevator is broken. Difficult to get to my room. Guests were complaining but no action is taken.;3
Not the best hotel I've stayed in but I sure do like it. Close to the airport and just a few minutes walk from some nice places like CVS, Trader Joe's and a few restaurants and tattoo shops. If you catch bus number 3 in a bus stop nearby you'll be in Venice Beach in less than 25 minutes. The hotel is pretty clean, the restaurant is decent and the employees are very helpful. I've been there 3 times and like it more every time.;4
Room was not clean. We found a neck tie underneath desk. Curtains were torn and ragged, but that was in the reviews. We would have hoped that would have been corrected. Employees gathered at the end the hotel lounge bar laughing and joking about the guests, complaining about upper management, ignoring the customers, then clearing out when the boss came around. Happy hour was not offered until we asked about it. Parking lot and spaces too small. Gentleman handling shuttle rides in the early morning was very good.;3
I advise you do not stay at this hotel! Upon arriving the hotel pre authorised $50 a day for a 11 night stay, nowhere on the hotel confirmation via Booking.Com does this clarify this. So basically they charged my card £1200 and put a pre authorisation hold on my account for an additional  £1500 . Completely ruined my whole holiday, so I had no money in my account other than the US dollars that I had on me, thankfully my friend that was saying with me helped me out otherwise I would of been completely screwed. Had this $50 a day charge been made clear when booking this hotel I wouldn't of had a problem but this was unexpected. The hotel manager Ed told me he would take the hold of on the 4th night of our stay but after just speaking to my bank they have confirmed the hold for the;1
Stayed here for one night after a late flight into LAX. Staff were very friendly and room was spotless. You can't really hear noise from the airport - the only noise we experienced was some people partying a few rooms down until 4am! Overall this hotel does the job and would stay here again.;4
As a Platinum SPG member I am very picky with my hotels and when I find a place that make me feel like home... I make it my home. The staff is great and very knowledgeable of the area. If you go to the Restaurant as for Marcela, Patty or Don Jose or Doña Maria... They will treat you like a VIP.;5
I had opportunity to stay a lot of times, all staff are very kind, special Juan front desk, Jess, Thereza taking care about transportation with airport !!! Congratulations for Sheraton !!! Very nice staff;5
All ok except the wifi would not connect in the lobby clean and comfortable. The cafe is expensive and so is the beer. We were happy with what we paid and got a good sleep. The shuttle was excellent. Pool average better than no pool;4
Had to spend a night here because of messed up flights. Used SPG points because they wanted over $300 a night for the short notice stay. Since my last visit to this hotel they have done a lot of remodeling. They now have three airport shuttle buses that are very nice and run regularly so you don't have to wait too long to get a ride to the hotel or be taken back to the airport.  Rooms are clean though very basic with amenities. It works for an overnight close to LAX.;4
We have stayed three nights in this hotel when visited LA for business. Check in was painful. It took a while to get our keys.Walls are not soundproof and I could hear everything from the next room and corridor. My room could be definitely better cleaned. I read a review here that somebody had a hair and blood on the bathroom floor. Seems that we have shared the same room. it is funny but I had a feeling that somebody got killed in my room. My laundry didn't arrive on time so I had to check on the reception the next day. They founded it but it was not the way I wanted. Reception immediately responded that they are not liable for any laundry and it is not their problem. Overall the place could be better managed and better cleaned. My rate was not that cheap. You can definitely;3
Definitely a great hotel to relax, work, whatever suits your needs! Was especially relaxing for us staying here the night before our flight, due to their shuttle service to LAX, and of course, to get some good rest here!  - I was surprised at the magnitude of this hotel. Lots of space to work, relax, eat (restaurant or snackbar style)  - Rooms are very clean and spacious. Missed a fridge (ask lobby if that concerns you) - Everyone is very welcoming, and guest-friendly. Really plays an integral part for the overall experience - Pool is very spacious, and looks great at night with lots of people there creating a nice atmosphere  - Desk charger was inoperative and damaged (see image). Only found this out the next day, so neither of my devices were charged, causing quite a hassle at;4
From the beginning it was a mixed bag. Check-in was slow but they were nice when I made it up to the front desk. The lobby was directly behind us and then a glass wall with the pool behind that. The pool was smaller than it looked in photos and not a great place to lay around in the sun since it was ground floor surrounded by the high walls of the hotel. Small cafe for a quick (albeit pricey) croissant/bagel & coffee style breakfast and a bar next to that.   $25 per day parking but, if you are lucky, there are some sketchy street parking areas outside the hotel for free.  Upon arriving on our floor we began discussing the smell in the hallway - it had the old cigarette smell of a hotel that used to be a smoking hotel...then we opened the door to our room. The smell in there made;2
Booked off of Hotels.com.  Very nice hotel.  Updated lobby.  Check in was easy and friendly.  Room is great for business traveler.  Plugs on the desk.  Fridge in the corner.  Comfortable chair and big desk.  Free wifi was too slow to stream football.  Air conditioner worked great as it's a hot day in LAX today.  Price value was excellent.;4
Nice Lobby and Staff. Elevators are very slow and one was out of service. Lobster Mac N Cheese was pretty good at the bar.   It was the smallest hotel room ever.  I have been at at least 100 hotels. The room was comfortable but the furniture and bathroom is kind of tired. Blankets on the bed were very worn, small holes.  For the price, I expect better.  It was a fine stay for one night. Hardly enough room to open or store 3 suitcases from 1 week vacation, it left no room to navigate the room.   The pool area is nice considering mid city.;3
A lady with a large pit bull greeted us in the lobby and there was hair and blood on the bathroom floor.  There was a sound in our room that sounded like water, running down the walls.  On a lighter note, the check in process was pleasant, and Juan was professional and tried to be helpful. I think they need more help and they need to pay more attention to detail.;1
The Front Desk clerk at Check in did not give me my Breakfast Coupon , he told me to just tell them in the Morning, but instead I had to have it and had to go stand in the check out line to retrieve our passes. Then my parking ticket was not validated right had to back out of the parking area to leave and go back to front desk to have this corrected. Concierge working on Aug 27th 2016 was outstanding and helped our Party out and got us a Town car driver to take us to Sur Lounge and then up to Sunset blvd and he set us up with a driver to come pick us up when were ready for pick up and back to the hotel. Both drivers where so nice and friendly. Breakfast was very good and great selection and the Juice was fresh Yummy. The down fall to this Hotel was the internet did not work well;3
We stayed one night at the Sheraton hotel which was quite pleasant. The staff was very helpful and kind with us. TV didn't work in our room. This was very rapidly solved by substituting our room with a more spacious one. The rooms are clean and the King beds are big.;4
This is an airport hotel and with that not a lot around it but that's what we were expecting. Free wifi, they have a gym mini fridge in room. The bathroom (see attached picture) and other areas of our room could have been cleaned better and the maintenance of the room looked like it needs cleaning of the walls paint etc a little dirty for a Starwood property in my opinion. Not sure I would come back here just because of the room cleanliness issue. The location is great though for the airport and they have a free airport shuttle.;3
Very comfortable stay before AM flight from LAX. Great shuttles. New buses always ready to go. Nice pool. Good breakfast. Used Starwood points - good value. Stayed here many times . Ask for free breakfast. Very close to terminal 1 at LAX. Can't go wrong here.;4
everything was clean . there wasnt any drawers to put my clothes other than the closet. the breakfast was very good here and the pool area was clean and modern . there were nough lounge chairs inaide and out. close to thw airport;4
Located close to LAX and priced reasonably. Nice and clean, fast check in and check out. Comfortable room with some newer renovations to what was an older property. With both a Bar and Restaurant on site you have some choices, overall for the location and price this is a good choice.;4
Great hotel priced reasonably right at LAX airport. Convenient to beach restaurants and great shuttle service to airport terminals. Relaxing bar and easy check-in / check- out. Try them on your next visit to Los Angeles.;4
This place has a great location, close to the airport (LAX) and with a pleasant staff.  The rooms are a bit dated, though it was clean, the place could use some cosmetic touch ups.  Given this, it's a bit pricey for the condition.  Very comfy bed, prompt valet parking, free drink in the bar coupon is given when you check in.  No in-room safe...which I just totally find ridiculous these days.  Parking was quite expensive too.;3
I stayed here while on corporate travel. It is a nice, modern facility. It was in close proximity to my meeting location, airport, car rentals and shopping and dining.  The hotel has it's own restaurant, bar and coffee kiosk.  The rooms are clean, quiet and spacious.  The hotel also offers a secure parking lot (approx. $21/day). So if you are here on business or to stay overnight to catch an early flight for LAX this is the place for you.;4
Pretty good-value airport hotel and does what it says on the tin. The central location of the airport made this hotel a good base for exploring LA's western beaches.  The housekeeping unfortunately was not up to par. One night our son wet the bed (thanks, Universal Studios Zombie attraction) and we called for new sheets which were brusquely delivered and turned out to be thoroughly damp. We had to call again to get a new set of dry ones. On neither occasion did the fellow offer to take away the soiled sheets so we piled them in the bathroom for the day maid to take. Finally for whatever reason no housekeeper came at all that day so we had urine-soaked sheets sitting in our bathroom for almost 24 hours.  One expects better.;3
Very outdated, dark.  Took forever to check in.  Place was old and nothing felt clean.  In for one night, early flight and I couldn't wait to leave.  I think there is s nicer section of hotel but if you get the old dirty section, they need to inform you and give BIG discount.;1
Great hotel staff! Everyone from front desk, waiters and housekeeping were very friendly. Nice cold rooms . Clean swimming pool with ample seating. Awesome chicken sandwich at the bar and really big local beer selection. Definitely coming back when in town.;5
"The positive points of the hotel include:  location to the airport; free airport shuttle; pool and other outside areas and the public rooms.  Now the negative:  although the room was very clean and relatively nice the thermostat was set at 62 degrees and literally an ice box upon arrival; the port on the desk to set up a computer did not work; the USB charging port did not work; the phone did not work (At All).  Checking in was easy, checking out was easy until I tried to explain what was not working in the room.  I then felt rushed and felt that we were not communicating on the same page.  I do not speak Spanish and I would say most of the staff spoke Spanish as their first language.  Communication was a problem.  Restaurant was ok, but over priced and the service was really";3
Super friendly staff, nice quite rooms, that were well kept. Also close to westfield shopping centre, if you need some last minute shopping before leaving.  They also have very nice airport shuttle, that is not like the other super noisy once. The food was good, they offer both a nice dining restaurant and a grill place for more basic foods like sandwiches and burgers.;5
Riza Mellendrec, the manager on duty, made my stay exceptional.  She was so warm and welcoming and did everything possible to accommodate my family of four, including two young children.  Also, Johnny, who checked us in, was extremely professional and friendly.  The room was perfect and the breakfast was delicious.  The shuttle to the airport, both to-and-from, was timely and courteous.  We used the long-term parking which was affordable, convenient and secure.  They made this Gold member feel like a Platinum member.  I get that this isn't a 5 star hotel, but the staff made it 5 stars.  We are frequently travelers and have the highest elite status with Ritz, Hilton and Hyatt and Gold with SPG.  We regularly stay at 5 star resorts.  For an affordable overnight stay before an;5
Lipstick slapped on a strangely configured old property. Cheaply done renovation - just felt cruddy.  Primary problem was the walls were paper thin - you could hear every noise from at least two rooms down in either direction.  There was a fellow coughing his lungs up in the next room, and even with earplugs in and pillows on either side of my head, I could not block him out.  I was so desperate for a couple hours of shut eye that I ended up taking a cab to the Westin in the middle of the night and getting a room there.  The only reason the rating is 'Poor' and not 'Terrible' is that the restaurant made a decent effort.;2
I have stayed here more than six times in the last ten years and unfortunately the hotel -- service, room quality, bar and food -- have declined over time to a point where there are much better options for the price in the LAX area.     First, it took 30-40 minutes of waiting to get the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel.  Second, the check-in process took long due to insufficient front desk staff. Third, the corridors on the floors need new carpets and painting -- frayed carpets and dirty walls -- and the air conditioning in the room was VERY loud, so much so that I had to turn it off to fall asleep.  Fourth, the bar, which I used to like a lot, seems to have had a downturn with fewer beers on offer and no pretzels or bar snacks -- although the chicken wings I ordered;2
Quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  Old, smelly and load.  Very, very loud.  The rooms were like a dorm.  No windows to the outside.  Just a window to the corridor.  Being a airport hotel people were coming and going all night.  This is to be expected but the noise is unbearable and it is not managed.  All the doors slam like a jail cell and keep you awake.  Like a dog barking in the middle of the night.  As soon as it stops and you start to fall asleep up it starts again.  Do not stay here if you want a good night sleep.  There are plenty of other hotels in the area and I would check this out before staying in this hotel.  Staff are also quite inattentive and unhelpful.  Having said that I did complain quite bitterly in the morning about the condition of the;1
It was clean. Bed was good. Quiet. It was a hotel room that met requirements. Small TV, almost no decor (one hidden picture in the room - otherwise blank walls).  Had a coffee maker, free water. No bath amenities.  Bath towels weren't absorbent.  Group rate was $139. So I guess in LA it's a good price.;3
Sadly the team at Four Points let us down. The hotel has basically 2 sections. In the section we stayed in, the air con is central and no way to adjust. secondly the beds in this section are terrible. After a horrible nights sleep, we phoned first thing in the morning. The staff at the desk were great and offered a new room and a full refund for the night. The manager on duty gave us his business card and then said he would contact the travel agent and sort out our refund. sadly he never did this. we have emailed him 5 times and he hasn't had the decency to even reply. the hotel has some great things, but surely that means nothing when management lie...;3
Stayed here for 1 night to accommodate our 1 day visit to the LA area before heading home the next day from LAX to Toronto, Canada.  This Hotel was located down the street from the Airport Car Rental locations, which made it convenient for us to drop off our car quickly and arrive at the Airport to catch our 6 am flight.  Getting to the hotel upon arrival and back after a day in LA was another story.  Traffic was terrible, but at the same time expected when passing through LA and LAX area specifically.  The front of the hotel, lobby, and pool area all look great, but things go down hill from there.  We had a room on the 3rd floor.  The hallway was dark and depressing.  The rooms were clean and the carpet looked pretty new, but hotel doors, furniture, and bathroom fixtures;3
Has a beautiful lobby but rooms need updating.  Lamps in bathroom were broken, drapes were old and stained. The room itself smelled musty, I'm guessing it was the carpets.  I waited too long for the shuttle to take me to the airport, was told it would be about 15 minutes.  A couple standing beside me ended up taking a taxi.  I don't think I got what I paid for.;3
Having stayed in over a half dozen hotels near LAX, I found this one to be an adequate one to spend time before a flight.  The room was average in size.  The bathroom was a bit small, and slightly dirty. Wifi worked well and was free.  Parking is $25/day.  Okay place to stay if the price is right.;3
The hotel is good but the rooms are not worth 3 stars.  My room felt like 90% humidity with the air conditioning not functioning, just a crappy fan.  Asked for a room change (2 beds), as no room with the same bed config was available I asked for two single room. The girl from the laughed...  The best solution was: go to another hotel  Don't visit this horrible rooms hotel and crappy service.;1
"Like many hotels close to international airports, they tend to be more worn down from constant use. The Four Points was no exception. The room just never felt clean and that was before I found a large yellow stain on one of the pillow cases. I got into my room late and after driving for almost 5hrs to get to LA I had no energy to wait around for someone to bring me a new pillow, so I just threw it on the floor in hopes it would be taken away in the morning. To my surprise and disgust, when I got back to my room after a conference the next day, the same gross pillow with giant yellow, mystery stain was back on the bed. This time the stain was touching the bed and behind another pillow; like housekeeping was trying to hide it. After I called housekeeping it was almost 45 minutes";2
"I stayed here for the weekend while in LA on business.  The hotel is very close to LAX and all the major car rental agencies (DIRECTLY across the street from Budget)  For a 3 star hotel this place was definitely lively.  When I arrived there was aDJ spinning at the outdoor pool and it seemed to be the place to hang out.  There is the requisite cafe/bar with a small coffee bar as well as a full menu of lite bites as well as entrees.  I had a few appetizers and they were pretty good.  The drink menu was creative and I tried a few of the selections; enjoying them all. My room had 2 queen beds.  It was small but it worked for me.  Not overly fancy, definitely 3.5 stars, but it was clean and quiet.  I rested well.   All staff I encounter was extremely helpful and polite.  Kudos to";4
After a 7 hour long flight I was looking forward to getting settled for the evening and a chance to catch up on emails and work. The shuttle service is complimentary and it was very easy to find and access from the terminal I came into. No call necessary and the driver was nice, polite and helpful. The ride didn't take more than 5 minutes.  The hotel itself has a small, but nice enough outdoor pool, right outside the lobby which was a nice touch and there is also a fitness room/gym. Check-in was fast and efficient and the lobby area is modern and welcoming. The hallway leading to the room had ripped carpets which was a shame.  The hotel room was very spacious and the bed amazingly comfortable which is of course very important. The bathroom was clean and felt nicely done up,;3
I stay here a lot on business. It's a fair hotel to me. It's usually clean. The gym is pretty good. The business center is nice but you pay a lot to print. The bar/restaurant area is nice as well. The pool area is nice with a lot of lounge chairs around the pool. The rooms are a decent size, I've stayed in a fewer rooms that are newer than others. Overall, I don't mind staying here at this hotel in one of the newer rooms.;3
This hotel is reasonably close to LAX. We spent two days here and the staff are wonderful. They do have a swimming pool but nothing fancy though. But at least the kids like it. Nice, little restaurant. A bit expensive though. What's also nice during our stay is we get to request as many water bottles as I can without a frown or something. Accommodating staff with all the smiles on their faces.;4
One of the three elevators was constantly not in operation.  A convention was going on at the same time I was there..so wait times in the elevator lines was the order of the day. Fire alarm went off at 4:30 am..then an all-clear announcement over the hotel intercom.  Only to have it do the same thing every 20 minutes two more times..  Luckily, no fire, but it did start my morning three hours before I had planned. Parking is expensive ($25 a day)..;4
Most airport hotels are similar and this one is reasonable for those seeking a short stay near LAX. The staff were friendly and accommodating, both on reception and throughout the hotel. The room was nicely furnished and equipped, and as quiet as airport hotels can be with the traffic and plane noise. The gym is good and all equipment worked. Didn't try the pool but it looked nice. Breakfast was a typical but unimpressive fare - lacking any really healthy options. In the room, a faulty radio alarm emitted strange noises during the night for no apparent reason which robbed me of much needed sleep. The worst thing is the shuttle bus service. I stood at the terminal for 40 minutes waiting for the shuttle - sure the traffic was bad, but in the same time 3 Crowne Plaza shuttles went;3
Love this hotel, it's comfortable, staff are very nice, nice pool. Tv has a lot of channels, everything is clean, the bed is comfortable, shower is great. Close to airport with a free shuttle. Close to sepulveda boulevard for some shopping. Bus station is near for any bus, rapid 3 brings you straight to downtown Santa Monica. Yes there's some noise from the planes but oh duh you're right at the airport. I always travel with earplugs.;5
Stopped here for a night for an introduction en route further into the US from China. Shuttle service from the airport was efficient and the drivers friendly. The check-in was painless and the room adequate.   Wet floor after shower, expensive water/coffee downstairs on the down side. Extremely comfortable bed and friendly staff on the plus.;4
This is the only 24 hours scheck in/out for LAX  Very nice & recently upgraded hotel. Room is nice. Spacious and clean.  Suitable for night departure as check in is based on 24 hours. Good location. Shuttle is 24 hours.   Good for business & family friendly stay.  Definitely recommend & stay again for night depature out of LAX;5
2nd time staying here was hoping it might be better than the 1st ,paid for a deluxe room under the 24hour room policy ,but the room was the same  as a standard we had last time . Rooms are very small and need updating along with bathrooms ,don't think I will return gave it a second chance but no better than the 1st time;3
"Arrived late but there are shuttle from airpot every 30mn. I chose this one because it was near the airport, a gym and a shuttle;  The room was spacious, very friendly staff. 2 free bottles upon arrival in the room, a fridge (really nice). It's only at 13 US dollars from Westfield mall (one of my favourite in Culver City) there are taxis outside the hotel all the times.  Free wifi.  I was on the 6thfloor but I dont remember the number....  I will go back.";4
We were put up here when United forced a missed connection on us.  Front desk area looked nice enough, staff was friendly and efficient.  Once we got out on our floor, we encountered throughly confusing signage directing us to our room.  The room had the feel of aged update from on old motor lodge.  We found a random t shirt hanging up on the curtain rod.  Unsure how housekeeping missed this.  The white bead spreads had stains on them.  Tattered shower curtain. Random safety pin sitting on top of the coffee machine area.  Just get the idea that attention to detail is not a top concern here.  That all said, bed was comfortable one you set aside your suspicions about overall cleanliness and there is free wifi.;2
From beginning to end was amazing! We dropped our bags to this hotel for 10 days and returned before boarding our flight back to New Zealand. Bags were well looked after. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Airport is very close and they have free shuttles that run very consistently. Pool area is great while you are waiting for your flight. Very clean rooms and lovely housekeepers;5
"Checked in the evening before an early morning flight. Friendly staff, very nice room. AT 1AM A GROUP ENTERED THE FLOOR, MADE CRAZY-NOISE, KIDS JUMPING, SLAMMING DOORS.... Ok, ""this is going to go away soon"" I thought. No. Kept going. Frolicking in the corridor, adults voices, kids screams...  CALLED hotel security. ""We will send someone up in a few minutes.""  10 minutes go by: no one.  Call again.  5 minutes later a security person arrives, who is slight build and 5' tall.  Good luck.  Talks to disruptors on either side of our room.  1 minute later, noise resumes.  HOTEL has NO Control over rowdy tenants.  Amazing.  Then.... at 6am got a wake-up call !!! (never asked for one).   Then... at 6:40 am the FIRE alarm goes off.  Many foreigners in hotel did not know how to evacuate";1
It's a Sheraton so you know what to expect. It has that Sheraton feel. Clean, comfortable rooms. Very close to the airport if that is a must. The only thing that irked me were the extra charges. No free breakfast (it's expensive), no free coffee (really?), no free computers. With what you're paying the extra fees feel like a slap in the face. This is why I had to give it a three out of five. There are pros and cons with this one.;3
With all of the major hotels in the LAX area, its easy to overlook the Four Points Sheraton on Airport Blvd. But you shouldn't! Conveniently located, it offers the best service that I've encountered at any of the other major hotels in the LAX area (Marriott, Hilton, Westin). Particularly noteworthy are the staffs at Cnfort Restaurant and the Front Desk. I firmly believe that this level of service emanates from the top. The general manager, Peter Kolla was most hospitable and understanding during my lengthy stay. His attentiveness to the guest experience is reflected in the service level of his staff. Also helpful was F&B Director Roberta Enriquez and her outstanding staff at Comfort Restaurant. Do yourself a favor the next time you're looking for a hotel at LAX and stay here.;5
Great stay, good staff, close to everything, the only thing that was frustrating was trying to get an Uber there. The bar was exceptional and the pool area was also, no pool heater but still was ok to swim;4
Beds not made up properly so needed to ask more sheets. Front desk and guest services doesn't answer their phone. Beds small. Shower luke warm. Humidity in rooms such that everything felt damp. Bathrooms not fully clean. Would not stay again or recommend to others.;1
We had a 12 hour lay over in LAX so we decided to stay here for a day rate of $139 from 10am-6pm. the shuttle from the airport was roomy and nice. The lobby of the hotel was also clean. Our room was NOT ready when we arrived and the lady at the front desk named Jazmin was not friendly and did not apologize for the delay. She did not smile and acted almost annoyed every time i went to the front desk to check on the status of our room.  Our room looked dated and the door to the bathroom wouldn't close. Overall the room was clean and the bed/pillows felt comfy.  It had good wifi, a place to shower, and a nice bed to unwind before our long trip to Australia. The kids enjoyed the outdoor pool. The area was clean with plenty of seating and the towels were stocked. The pool itself is a;3
What a dump!!! Pictures bare no relationship to the actual rooms!! Rude staff, long lines to check in and check out and dreadful restaurant (I walked out without eating)! Reception area is nice but that is where it ends, felt like a cheap motel.......  Avoid at all costs is my advice!!!!;1
This is close to the airport and it is fine for a standard hotel. The room had some maintenance issues that just seemed like something housekeeping should have noticed. The room was very humid and we could not get comfortable all night. The servers in the sports bar were wonderful, we enjoyed dinner there. The staff at the hotel seemed to be wearing many hats and not very eager to assist. I'm not sure I would stay here again unless I had to.;2
"We stayed here for a quick overnight before an early flight.  Arriving about 4 pm, there were two employees doing check in, and we waited over 1/2 hour.  We had two rooms.  The clerk asked if we wanted to be very close or very far apart.  We said, ""Same floor would be great"".  He gave us 216 and 218, telling us they were next to each other.  When we arrived at the second floor, we realized that 216 was all the way at the end to the right of the elevators, while 218 was to the left.  Not impressed.  We asked about food.  We were told to go to the bar, as the dining room didn't open until 5.  We did this, and this experience was great.  Food was good (although the burger price was $1 more in the bar than the restaurant) and the bar tender was very accommodating.  My co-worker";3
We stayed here for 4 days on our arrival so the we could do all the LA sights amd then be away from the City. We also stayed on our last night before getting our flight home.  The locarion to the airport and LA was perfect.  The hotel itself is nicer inside that it looks from outside and has everything you need, including  online check out.  The only thing that needs to improve is the check in desk.  As this is for for both check in and normal hotel enquiries the queues are long.  On both check ins, we waited more than 30 mins, this after a 16hour flight was horrendous!  Other than that everything as perfect...friendly, clean and good food;5
I stayed here for 1 night whilst on business. It ticks all the boxes as it were. The staff were helpful and very efficient, Jonny on CheckIn was very good. The rooms are quite big and comfortable. Everything was tidy and clean on arrival. The shower and bathroom whilst basic are perfectly adequate. The towels could perhaps do with renewing but again perfectly suitable for the task at hand.  It was quite a late arrival so I just ate in the bar which had some good craft beers on tap and friendly staff.  The wifi throughout the hotel is free although the connections in the room was a little slow compared with the main areas. It was hard to check in for my flight in the room.  The hotel is close to all the car rental firms and it was a simple walk across the road to collect my car;4
We stayed here overnight after arriving in la. Great location for car rentals pick up( budget rentals across the road ). Got two rooms for the family of four. They put them side by side. Burger King across road 4 min walk . Hit the spot for late night nourishment . All in all I would recommend.;4
The Four Points Sheraton is very close to the airport, which is why we chose it. When we arrived, our initial impression was very positive. It was clean, nicely decorated, etc. Check in was efficient and the staff members were all friendly.   Then we went to our room. There is a new wing that we walked through to get to our wing. I mentioned how great it smelled as we walked through it. Then we arrived out the west wing. The rooms here are very old and look like a closed in hallway was added and that the hotel used to have outdoor open air entrances to the rooms. (Which was also clear based on the giant windows outside our room.). This room smelled old, musty, and nothing like the other wings. The rooms were kept clean, but everything was VERY old. (Like there weren't even plug;3
The hotel is huge, long walk from the front to check in and elevators. Sheets on the sofa bed didn't look clean so we called down and they brought up sheets and pillow in a large, clear plastic bag. About midnight we discovered that the sheets in the plastic bag were wet! Hubby took them down to the desk and got dry sheets.The handle on the bathroom door seems to be installed backwards, the door does not close securely.The room we are in is outfitted nicely, newer furniture, curtains. The hallway has really ratty carpet but if you could only spend your money on one thing I guess it had better be the guest rooms. Support staff, housekeeping, etc. were very nice and attentive. It still shocks me to pay over $200 per night for a hotel room AND $25 per day to park your car, but LA;3
The lobby and the public areas downstairs are very nice.  My room was older and could use some updating, the air conditioner didn't co below 74 until the morning I was ready to check out.  The bed was comfortable and clean.  Some of my co-workers mentioned the noise from the airport disturbed them, but I didn't even notice from my room.    This hotel is very close to the airport and the hotel shuttle wars great for pick up and drop off!!!!;3
Reception area very smart and professional. The gym is adequate with 8 or so running/step/bike machines & they have a few free weights, 2 benches and a cable machine, so it's OK. The rooms and facilities in them are not up to scratch, however. Electrical pugs that didn't work, flaky TV remote, bathroom taps loose from walk, noisy air con in the room and the corridor, towels that were fairly worn, no in-room fridge... But I have to say the bed (mattress) was very comfortable. I stayed there about 7 years ago and it's had a refit on the ground level but otherwise not much...;3
We used this hotel as a brief stopover prior to a late night flight (didn't actually stay the night). Its probably amongst the older hotels next to the airport and this shows a bit in the rooms. The bathroom was quite small, but otherwise it served our purpose and was comfortable enough. We ate the restaurant, which delivered a pretty good meal. Interestingly, they offer a remarkable list of boutique beers.;4
I live in Santa Barbara and getting to an early morning flight out of LAX means driving and parking or taking the airbus which for an early flight means leaving the house around 3 AM. Many times I will airbus down the night before and stay at the Four Points. The rooms are good and clean as they are at their other locations. This one has a really good selection of beers on tap and in the bottle (like over 100 if I recall correctly). They have a shuttle that runs to LAX and it's only a few minutes away. Good option to keep in mind.;4
Good overnight for early morning flight.  The rooms need major update.  Good beds but bathroom super old. Had an AC problem but was able to have an electrician fix it. Make sure you in line for the bus they only can take 11 at a time.;3
We stayed at the Four Points Sheraton LAX and paid for the additional parking (six days) and shuttle service to the airport. Check in at the hotel was efficient but there was literally one parking spot left in the self parking lot and the spaces were VERY tight, even for a midsize car (all parking is outdoors).  Our room was well appointed and our stay was pleasant with an efficient shuttle to the airport the morning we left. Unfortunately, we were not happy with the shuttle service when we returned on a Friday night at 9:00 pm. After securing our luggage we made our way to the shuttle pick up area at LAX. (Please note that this area includes all passenger drop on/drop off from every hotel shuttle, parking garage shuttle and passenger traffic. This area is an absolute disaster;4
The location of the Four Points Sheraton is desirable, just minutes away from LAX.  The shuttle service from the airport to the hotel is horrendous.  There's just too much traffic and there aren't enough Sheraton shuttles.  It took us 35 minutes for a shuttle to come by.  A flight crew boarded shortly after we did and the pilot let the driver have it because he claimed he was waiting for 45 minutes (which is ridiculous).  To the driver's credit he was apologetic and informed us that they didn't have enough vans which is what caused the massive delay.  The hotel is nice, but the rooms are very old and need new carpet badly. The bathroom had dispensers in the shower (Shampoo, Conditioner, Body Wash) and as I attempted to dispense the body wash, the entire cradle came off the wall;3
Good stay and was clean. Nice enough but a bit dated and in need of a refresh on some of the in room amenities like fridge, tv, desk, and decor.  Mostly slept here and did not utilize any other amenities really other than fitness center.  That was solid and had a mix of runners and climbers as well as machines.;4
I would like to recognize Tito or kuya Jess (guest service) for his warm treatment, friendly smile.... i arrived at 6am in the hotel, unfortunately my check-in suppose to be at 11 or 12pm, now imagine where i can go with 2 luggage of almost 100 lbs after a long flight with 2 stops. Philippine  - Guam - Honolulu - LA...so i meet Kuya Jess, a friendly person who keep me update with what should i do, or where i can go....without to worry about my luggage...  Salamat po, ingat ....;4
We have stayed here every year for the last five years and I have reviewed this hotel in the past but there are many great updates and refurbishment in 5 years. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are sufficiently big enough for the stop over. Big King beds and good linen. Large sunny outdoor Pool with Bar and food, with plenty of loungers to get rid of the jet lag. Restaurant and bar food much improved and very good for a meal, breakfast and lunch. Budget rental cars right across the road which is so convenient. Four Points has its own shuttle bus running every 20 minutes but best to ring the hotel on flight arrival to make it a short wait as the hotel is only 6 minutes away.  A short walk to the Manhattan Beach Pier and Village Express Bus which runs every 30 minutes.;5
I've stayed at all of the best/better properties for LAX.  The Four Points is a great choice whether for an overnight, or 1-2 week stay...I've stayed here about 10 times over the last few years.   BUT, its all about the room location (3 to choose from)  See below.  They recently renovated a few years back, so the rooms still feel fresh.  The bathrooms smell of bleach (in a good way)  Every time I stay at the hotel, the rooms are CLEAN!!  The bed is 4points comfort...so not the best, but good enough, a little on the harder side which works for some.  Asians will love it, since beds are so stiff over there. I also love the old school New York white tiled bathrooms.  They are small, but not cramped!  Room Location: Front of the hotel facing LAX is my preferred spot.  Nice views of;5
This hotel is a good option for those traveling through LA on business. The hotel is pretty standard for a Sheraton, but the room is a nice size for a large US city. Breakfast is served at the restaurant found across from the front desk and features a standard buffet style breakfast with an omelet bar.;3
Booked here because we wanted to leave our car while on vacation and stay when we returned. On arrival to drop the car off the staff were extremely helpful and I was looking forward to our stay on our return. Having been up for 20 hours, it wasn't a great start when the free shuttle decided to drive past the pick up zone when we waved them down and we had to wait 30 mins for another one! Slow check in, but pleasant staff. The room was not the cleanest though. I always do a quick check when I enter and it looked ok, it wasn't until after the kids were in their pj's and room service was ordered that I noticed stuff stuck to the front of the toilet - gross! I know they have to work quickly so I'm never too worried about corners or under night stands being a little dusty and less;3
There wasn't major problem with this hotel just a lot of little one  Decor tired and not very clean , smallest bathroom ever , food over priced with poor quality  . Shuttle to airport great as were most of the staff  Have stayed in Sheraton's before and always though of them as better than most but sorry will not come here again;2
I was on a business trip to phoenix, I stayed in this hotel and the service was great, very comfortable rooms and bed, they have all amenities in the room, very convenient if you are taking a flight early.;5
We've stayed here several times when leaving on an early morning flight from LAX since we live 2 hours away from the airport. The shuttle(s) run every 15 minu between the hotel and the airport and back again. The parking lot is outdoors and uncovered. The rooms are fine. Checking in was slow--there was only one clerk although the front desk had spaces for about 5 clerks. It was annoying to have to wait behind 4 other guests checking in at 9:30 pm on a week night. My daughter liked the well-equipped 24 hour gym that she was able to use before our morning flight.;4
I stay at this hotel frequently when coming or going from LAX.  The rooms are spacious and it is one of the quieter hotels around the airport. Shuttle service is timely and the staff is always helpful. Also the room service food is excellent.;5
The room was spacious and the beds were like a dream with all the pillows.  The lobby was very nice with check-in, coffee bar, and bar with many tvs. We went on bus tour of LA that was impressive.  We went to Griffith Park, observatory and zoo.;5
I was so nervous about staying at this hotel at first, just because it is right next to the airport. I thought for sure there would be lots of noise from airplanes. But my fears were totally unfounded. It was absolutely quiet in the hotel. The breakfast was really good there. The staff was friendly, and over all it had the feel of a high end hotel. I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Los Angeles.;4
I had a good experience with my stay, upon arrival at LAX, I didn't have to wait long before the free shuttle to the hotel arrived, check in was fast and easy, they even gave free 'welcome' cookies.There was fast free wifi in the room and all areas of the hotel. Pool and gym area looked nice. The room and bathroom were very spacious and clean! I enjoyed breakfast as well. I didn't mind staying at this location because there are so many car rentals and/or uber cars around. It is easy to get around. Only downside is the parking fee, $25 per night is not cheap. But overall, it was enjoyable and I would stay here again.;5
Convenient to LAX - ok for a short overnight stay - ok value for money. There are better furnished and more comfortable hotels by LAX. It would not be my first choice. Worn carpets and bathtub very slow to drain;3
Overall lobby was very nice. Great location! I think they could of spent a little more time in bed rooms. For the price I think they could of done a better upgrade(s) for the rooms. T.v, showers, etc. For the price if I ever was to come back I would stay in a different hotel. Staff was great and very friendly.;3
Stayed here after a late flight into LA, with plans to uber to port terminal the next day for cruise. After waiting for the shuttle almost an hour (after repeated calls assuring us it should be there any minute), and watching them pack on way more than they should, we got to the hotel to then wait in line as they checked in all those people from the shuttle. Very slow elevators didn't help the rush of people trying to get to their rooms.  I'm not super picky on cleanliness, and the bed was comfortable. Bathrooms need thorough cleaning, as there is visible mildew in shower. If you need to take a shuttle to the airport, I'd allow a lot of time.;3
I spent one night here before an early morning flight. The property is located near rental car facilities, allowing you to return your rental car the night before and take the hotel's airport shuttle to catch your flight.  The price was about average for hotels in the area. The hotel is an older building, but the room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The TV channel selection was good.  There was a free appetizer reception the night I stayed, but I was unable to attend.  Parking is $25 per day, so add that to the room rate if your car needs a place to sleep, too.  Even though the property is near the airport, I barely noticed any plane noise.  If you plan to take the airport shuttle to an early flight, allow PLENTY of time because it can take a while to get to the airport.;4
For me this is one of the best hotels at the los angeles airport. I have stayed here numerous times and have gotten great service. We get upgraded when they can, the new shuttle service is a wonderful addition, directly to airport, no waiting like previous. rooms are very spacious and light. one of the most important features is the windows open, letting in fresh air, so you do not keep breathing disgusting recycled air from ac. Parking is easy and lots of room, try to get weekend parking package including with room. Lots of weekend deals to be had. Midweek is more corporate so don't expect any deals or the best of service when busy. new renovated lobby and bellman are always cheerful and ready to serve. excellent bar with plenty of tap beers.;5
This hotel was very disappointing. My room was very small, the bed was uncomfortable, and there was no alarm clock in room or outlet by the bed to plug my phone in. It was also very noisy. I did find the staff to be accommodating.;3
Avoid this place. There was smoke in two rooms. Front desk can hardly speak english. Managment is closing a blind eye to problems. Tried to speak to managment about this. Had to speak to corporate. This hotel is not in starwood quality.;1
"We had an overnight stop in LA and stayed close to the airport and Manhattan Beach at this hotel. The room we had was very spacious, the service was great for both dinner, breakfast and lunch. The bathroom was a bit small but not impossible and the lifts had an interesting up and down motion - bouncing; the shuttle to and from the airport was excellent so overall this is a good hotel to stay at if you are not venturing too far from the airport.";4
It was a quiet place with lg rooms.  Not the latest in decor but clean, classic bathrooms. A value for location. Restaurant was basic and fine.  Good drinks. Good tv, great shuttle service to and from LAX;4
The lobby of this hotel is very nice, but the rooms show their age.  I was only here overnight due to a layover.  I took the free shuttle from the airport. My driver was very friendly and chatted with me all the way to the hotel.  The beds were comfortable.  The rates for the room were very good.  You can hear hall noise, though.;3
Stayed at this room on the last night of a 7 day trip to Los Angeles area before flying out the next morning. Hotel restaurant was great and service at Concierge was fantastic - helped my friend & I by booking us a Disneyland tour. However, our room on the 7th floor was very disappointing - carpet was old and scummy, window was definitely old, beds felt unclean, shower didn't drain, and curtain and vanity was old. For the price of $189 USD (much higher Canadian), it was a definite disappointment!;2
Our room was nice, but parking costs $25 per day in addition to your hotel price. We were not aware of this until we checked in and it was not well-publicized when we booked the hotel - never saw it listed anywhere.;3
Close enough to airport free transfer and reasonable rates.  Rooms were reasonably basic but clean and had all you need to freshen up between flights.  The food in the bar downstairs was ok if you needed to eat staffs check in and check out were friendly and efficient;4
Clean and relatively modern hotel depending on what floor you get. It's definitely worthwhile to sign up for a Starwood rewards account, which will put you on a more recently renovated floor for free. It's clean, quiet, and has very reasonable parking packages. Shuttle is quick and frequent too.;4
Was trying to go to the hotel to stay after a missed connection at LAX.  Waited in the Hotel Shuttle pickup for more than 1 hour.  Made several calls to the hotel and was told each time shuttle would be there in 5 minutes.  Finally after a call and talking to the shuttle dispatcher the shuttle came in about 10 minutes.  Driver complained they only had a few shuttles and the airport was busy.  Several of were waiting from 3:45am to 5:00am for the shuttle bus.    While waiting we counted 8 Hilton hotel buses come by.  Guess which hotel I will choose next time.;1
"I stayed here for the night to catch an early flight out of LAX.  The room is alright.  Bed was comfortable, but the dirty grout line in the bathroom did bother me a bit.  Overall, it was alright; nothing to write home about.";3
The bathroom door will not stay closed on its own and the fire elevator would not go to the 8th floor kept skipping it rode the elevator two or three times before we finally just took the stairs in order to get to our room stayed in room 875;4
This hotel has a convenient location to LAX.  Rooms are clean and spacious.  Hotel restaurant is average and parking is on-site for $25 per day.  The only thing they could upgrade a bit in the rooms are the bathrooms.  They are clean but outdated.;4
Check in was ok. Our sink wouldn't drain as mechanism fault but we didn't have time to tell staff so left it full of water. Check out was different matter. Tried to charge us $35 for parking when we had no car and were reluctant to remove item. Had to explain we were on motorcycle tour and had turned bikes in and been bussed to hotel. Ate in restaurant and it was very expensive and average at best. 2 entrees 1 glass wine for $80 is a joke. Won't be returning here for sure.;1
A nice hotel situated near the airport, Helpful and friendly staff, they successfully arranged a tour and a cab for us. Room was large and comfortable, very clean but view overlooking staff car park and bins. Unauthorised $143 withdrawal taken from my card with only an explanation stating 'sorry, the computer just grabs an amount' ?? Yet to have it returned.  Keep an eye on your card payments.;3
We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel.  It fit every one of our travel needs. It was within walking distance of our rental car return, so we dropped our bags at the hotel and returned the car, walked back and took the convenient airport shuttle the next morning. No parking fees! The restaurant was open late, food was decent and it's a pet friendly hotel. Clean too. I'd stay again.;4
The FREE SHUTTLE is really easy and so fast - gets you from LAX to the hotel door to door in under 10 minutes. Check in line was busy on a Saturday night, but got through pretty quick. Hotel is dated and dirty to say the least which is why I gave 3 stars otherwise the beds are super comfortable (like all the SPG chain beds). Airconditioning was the old style so it was very noisy. Check out is fast and friendly and shuttle comes every few minutes back to the airport. All in all, a solid stay.;3
Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  This hotel is not the same caliber of other 4 Points I stayed at. Room was extremely mediocre, ... outdated and very basic.  I got the room through Priceline so perhaps some of the other rooms were higher standard.  If the price is right I wouldn't avoid the hotel but for the same price I think there would be better options.;3
We chose to stay here based on our prior experiences with the Sheraton/Starwood brand hotels.  This was, hands down, the worst Starwood property I have ever stayed at period.  We checked-in for Memorial Day weekend.  The staff we dealt with were all very friendly and accommodating (I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 because of the friendliness of the staff), but clearly overloaded and the hotel appeared understaffed.  There were bits of trash in the hallways and in the elevator.  The parking is listed on the website at $15/day is listed on the lot as $25/day.  We stayed in a double queen, booked through Expedia.  I can only describe it as shabby.  Linens were off color, and extremely worn/threadbare (including bed sheets).  The bed skirts had markings and clearly hadn't;2
The hotel appeared mildly renovated. Despite its location at LAX, there was little or no noise from the descending aircrafts. My particular room had no kitchen amenities (i.e., microwave and fridge) which could be used to absorb the cost of dining out. In addition, this location charges an additional premium for daily parking from $25 - $38 per day. 🤕  On the up side, hotel staff provided a sense of happiness. With certainty I will revisit Los Angeles, but likely I will not stay at this location ever again. I found Long Beach, California may serve a better stay for me and my family which offers more in its immediate area.;3
We stayed here for 3 nights. The beds and pillows are really amazing! We needed to arrange new passports and other documents. The staff was really helpfull. A special thanks to Jess and Trish, who made our stay much more comfortable! They helped us with many things without us even asking for it. What an amazing service!!! Thanks again!;5
located closer than westin to LAX, easy access n parking was behind hotel, would be great if they comp parking fees to SPG members. is a 4 points like any other, quick basic no frills with 2 front staff located right at entrance. friendly and helpful , had pc access to help check in and print boarding passes, very thoughtful and free.  rooms are decent n nice , have to walk around as building is L shape like to find room. nice as next door had a steak restaurant waking distance;5
We enjoyed our stay here and a special thanks to Martha Esparza she went above  and beyond  to make our stay pleasant. This hotel was only 3 minutes  from Lax. Breakfast was delicious the hotel was quiet and i got some of the best sleep;4
We chose this hotel solely based on it's 24 hour check in policy.  We checked in after an early morning arriving flight from Australia - 7am.  We found the shuttle to be pretty quick on the way but on the way back, we exited the hotel at 5.25am the next day to be met by about 20 other people also waiting!  We ended up getting an uber which turned up the same time as the shuttles (they ordered two because so many people were waiting).  I think they need to get this better organised.  I have read other people moaning about the same issue.    The room was very average.  The bathroom was tiny with a leaking shower - which they fixed after we asked them to.  No shower cap, toothpaste, nothing.  BYO everything basically!  Considering this hotel was $200 USD, I think that they could;4
"I often stay at this hotel when i am on business travel and am flying out of LAX. I live in Santa Barbara and find there are countless additional flight options if I make LAX my departure/arrival airport.  The Four Points by Sheraton at Los Angeles Airport is convenient to drive to/from, has ample amenities nearby for last minute purchases of travel supplies and meals, and has a regular shuttle service making it very convenient.  The only thing preventing me from giving this a ""5"" rating is that the parking at the hotel is not covered.  The staff are always friendly and very accommodating.  I travel a LOT and rarely do i leave reviews like this however I feel this location merits me taking to time to make this recommendation so others can have a positive trvel experience like I";4
The hotel is located nearby the airport which is perfect when time to leave.  The rooms were a bit small but quite comfortable . The staff was  friendly.  I really enjoyed the selection for  breakfast buffet.;4
My friend and I stayed at this hotel for just one night and it was great.  The service, food and facilities were excellent.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. My daughter did it as a Mother's Day gift and when she told the front desk, they gave us vouchers for food and drinks (even room service was included for the vouchers).  The rooms were beautiful and clean.;5
"Heavy doors SLAM shut. Rude neighbors means you will be awake throughout the night.  East side of the building is like a motel. Large glass window doesn't  buffer hallway noise.Thin walls; hear talking in the room next door.  Difficult to get the room temperature balanced. Needs an upgrade. $25.00 per day parking.WIFI sucks. Not worth price. Positives= staff were nice, towels soft, good food. Comfy bed/pillows. Lobby is nicely decorated and inviting.";2
We stayed here for one nights layover. We were able to check in early which made a big difference to us as we'd been travelling for the last 20 hours. Shuttle bus from LAX was easy and very convenient both ways. Furniture in room was in need of an upgrade but room was clean and beds were comfortable. From some of the reviews I was reading before we left I was a little concerned but all was fine.;4
Good hotel for stop over in LA. Close to all rental car companies. Most offer shuttle to you hotel.  Hotel shuttles run ever 20 min to LAX . Rooms are quiet Hotel has restaurant and bar. I don't know what other four points her life. But this hotel for this night was in my Perdiem. It's fine.;4
"The staff is the star. Great folks, helpful to a tee. The restaurant serves some awesome food. Delicious! The prices are high as one would expect, but I felt like we got the service of a meal at that price. The rooms are so poor they aren't even laughable. Not worth the breath. The ""towers"", as they call them, are nothing more than old motel buildings they put a front wall on, so they could call it a hotel. For a Four Points, the rooms were unbelievably run down and in very bad shape. For us, it was down the street from LAX and had free shuttle service, and the driver was a very nice lady, so the convenience factor was high. With the Four Points name on the front of the building, I expected a true Four Points property. What I learned was you might not be able to trust Four";2
this is definitely a 2nd tier property for a named brand hotel at LAX. if this is only place you can stay, you can tolerate one night. but for a few extra $ id recommend staying at a Marriott or Hilton branded hotel. the lobby has been done over but it deceives you. terrible checkin process. the shuttle to the airport for an early morning flight was efficient and friendly.;2
My girl friend who is a flight attendant accidentally left her uniform and a few other belongings in her room as she was in a hurry to make her flight.  The next day she called to inquire whether the items were found.  The manager on duty immediately contacted the hskp manager who advised her they did have the items and would send them fed ex the following day.  I work in the hospitality industry and fully understand how challenging lost and found can be.  The hotel could not have handled the situation any better.  I know we will be staying again on future travel to LAX.;5
Seriously, for these prices and a rating of a 4 star hotel. It's the worst I've been to.  The stay was for 4 nights Monday-Friday.  Checked in at 11:30pm, found a condom wrapper on the floor...now I don't even feel like getting on the bed. Went downstairs to change rooms, the guy says... sorry for the inconvenience, I'll upgrade you to a better room- Deluxe.  The room was smaller than the one I had, carpet was peeling off and the view was the back of the hotel, not a pretty sight. The restroom had the panel off that accesses the plumbing behind the shower, looked like any rodent or something would eventually crawl out of the hole.  I called the front again, this time Lawrence, room manager, said he heard about the room and is there anything he can do.   If I have to tell you to;1
Getting in to park was a joke - there were cars everywhere parked in plainly marked No  Parking spots, as well as in the lanes of the lot, making navigation ridiculously difficult.  No one there seemed to care.  Then you go inside and find a hotel that is more beat up, by a wide margin, than any Sheraton I've ever stayed at.  To get to our room, we had to go up one elevator, down a hall, then up some stairs, then into a back hallway in the stairwell, then back into a regular hallway, then into our room.  It was like being a maze getting in and out.  Once we were actually in our room, it was AMAZING how small the room was and what poor condition the bathroom was in.  Then, get this - not once - but TWICE - a hotel employee used their hotel key and just walked into our room.  No;1
The hotel is basic. Its clean and close to the airport.   Why the one star?? They ran out of parking due to a convention. I understand it brings hotels money to host conventions and meetings. I have worked in the hotel industry and I understand. So I returned my rental early and caught the shuttle to the airport to catch the hotel shuttle back to the hotel (since I was leaving the next day).   The it shuttle info on the website says every 20 mins so I waited and waited. Then I called and they said 25-30 mins. OK fine. Then the shuttle drove by and never stopped. It couldn't be full because we were the first stop. I wasn't going to wait again so I got on the Marriott lax shuttle which is next door to the four points. That shuttle made a stop at every section and open its doors;2
This hotel is one of the worst I have ever stayed in at this cost level.  The internet does not work at all.  Like, not at all.  The room as an AC unit that is inside the room and is incredibly loud, making a constant sound that is so loud I can barely sleep.  Like the sound of ten house fans.  The late-night room service menu consists of only 4 items.  The decor is worse than a Motel 6.;2
"Really disappointed with this hotel's housekeeping and general condition. Let's face it, you often don't have the highest expectations for an airport hotel but a Four Points should generally be a pretty decent stay no matter where it is.   The first thing I did upon opening the door to my room is notice the strong cigarette smell. I called down to the front desk to make sure they were aware of it so I was not charged for unauthorized smoking in the room. I elected not to change rooms or have housekeeping come up to ""deodorize it"" as the front desk staff had offered.  I also was very disappointed with the housekeeping and cleanliness of the room overall. I found dried food on the dresser the TV sits on, fingerprints everywhere on most  horizontal surfaces, and spots on the";2
Rooms too warm, front desk and lobby chaos, restaurant for those stuck at hotel to eat was very overpriced, hotel needs a lot of upgrading.  We don't recommend this hotel unless you have an overnight emergency stay.;2
The hotel offers free shuttle. Room was a bit old but still fine. Breakfast was fine. I would love to say thank you to all Front Desk staff and even the housekeepers are very helpful throughout my stay. Thanks to Martha E. at Front Desk and Musie at  Concierge. Both of you are amazing, very accommodating, and attentive!!!!! Definitely will return.;4
Clean modern hotel airport.  good for short stay.  good price for small room.  very big hotel. lots of pilots and business people.  good shuttle to airport. nice to have shampoo and body wash already in pumps in shower.  comfortable beds.  nice view of mts.  good for sunrise photos.;3
The shuttle transfer was very good but that was the only thing. Staff totally disinterested, bedroom with window looking into a hallway , bathroom that is good for a midget and a breakfast that scored one out of ten . This is the second worst hotel I have stayed at in 55 years of travelling ..best to stay away from LAX as well;2
"A very basic hotel, with core advantage being close to the airport; plus they provide a good quality airport shuttle service every 15 minutes. They have a very prompt and efficient concierge coupled with good team at the bell desk.  The place can be boring, the true saviour from any boredom is a visit to Manhattan beach, which has great sand, nice pier, very good views and nice restaurants. Plus for retail therapy Westfield Culver city mall is a short distance away. At the most it is a basic hotel for transit purposes only.";4
The hotel is not sound proof so the noise of nearby aircraft is disturbing. In addition the in room air conditioning was the noisiest such machine I have encountered.  Not a pleasant choice: aircraft noise and overheating or airconditioning noise.  Either way it was not a comfortable night.   The hotel is tired and shabby.  We couldn't check in on arrival.  So we left and came back late at night.  We had an 8 am flight the next day, so we didn't use any facilities.  The hotel is not good value.;2
I flew in from Miami to attend a wedding last weekend at this property. The service was exceptional. The staff in the ballroom (all the servers) was attentive, working quickly to serve and clear the tables and very friendly. As a Manager in the Food Service Industry, I would recommend this property to anyone looking to have an event in the LAX area!;5
We stayed one night for the early flight from LAX. This hotel is a bit old, but still comfortable and cost-effective. The laundry machine is available for 24h , which really helped us a lot. And their shuttle bus to LAX is available every 15 mins.;4
Did a park and fly.  Good for that.  Rooms are dated and need refurbishing.  Staff friendly, room clean. Food available. Shuttle service very convenient 24 hrs. Good pkg,when you do the Park and Fly. Left car there 14 days.;4
Arrived 10pm and had a 11.30 pm flight next day and this hotels 24 hour check-in was perfect. Toured LA next day went back to hotel at 7pm for shower and dinner then off to airport. Great. Now the bad news. The free shuttle is very unreliable we were told it was full until I pleaded with the driver to let us on as we had waited 30 min. Trouble was all the air crew were on board and when we arrived at hotel it was a sprint to the checkin where one person was working and 20 people were waiting. Returning to airport we gave up waiting (40 min) and got a cab. We were also double charged 2 days for our room instead of 1 but this was finally sorted out by the manager after 6 emails.  Room was good with a comfy mattress. Overall if it wasn't for the 24 hr room check-in  I'd  look;4
Just a quick stop off after we landed. Reasonable hotel for a reasonable price. The room had really comfy beds and a pool of you wanted it. We didn't eat here, instead we went around the corner to the Marriott and ate at Z pizza and breakfasted at Starbucks. We were also walking distance to the car hire place and there's a free shuttle bus from the airport to get you here. All in all very convenient if you're landing in LAX.;4
I travel every week and I can tell when a hotel is well run. This hotel understands what makes the frequent traveler keep coming back. They reward your status and they have really nice people working there. This hotel has an outstanding location, great rooms, excellent bar, Starbucks, nice pool, and super people working there. Only complaint was the shuttle service which they say they are addressing. Will always stay here when I come to LA.;5
I used to stay here due to its proximity to lAX and its lounge.  The service was always C+ to B at best.  Now its rooms are not what was promised (no fridge and not quiet) it smelled, and the staff while polite were working at their top capability.  I will not return.  I hope when Marriott takes over the chain it improves.   I stay about 100 nites a year in hotels and this hotel is so far the worse one this year.  It is run down, everything is expensive (juice, cola, etc.) my TV did not work and I called and was told someone would come to fix it immediately.  1.5 hrs. later i let the room and decided they did not care.  My room overlooked the front parking lot with no way to close out the view except by completely darkening the room.  I am a SPG,member of long standing and have;2
I have stayed at lots of Four Points and this was the worst one I have stayed at. Service was fine, lobby seemed fine. Room was not welcoming or fresh, very tired. Smelled odd. Bathroom was tired and had no ventilation. Would not stay here again. The rate was not reflective of this hotel, maybe if it was $99 I would understand.;2
Nothing wrong with this hotel for a short stay.  We flew in to LAX around 10:30pm, caught the shuttle and grabbed a bite to eat at the bar/restaurant.  I didn't pay for the breakfast buffet and it wasn't included in the price I paid.  I think it was supposed to be $21 if I wanted to pay for it.  burger King is about a half a block up the street but that's about it for food near this hotel.  The shuttle runs every 10-15 minutes. The shuttle driver that dropped us off in the morning was wonderful.  We had to go back to LAX to meet up for a cruise ship transfer.  The driver took us to departures and showed us exactly where the elevator was to get down to arrivals which was where we needed to be.;3
Have a couple of business opportunities that needed to be finalized. The Hotel I originally booked was disastrous so I changed to this one instead. The staff was friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was pretty good the location for me was excellent. The room was clean but I discovered a slow leak in the bathroom which was not repaired during my stay. The beds were a little firmer than I prefer but still provided a good night sleep.  If you drive or rent a car parking is $25 a day (come and go as many times as you like)   I Would stay here again for sure.;4
I picked this hotel because it was near the airport and would allow me to get to LAX for an early flight out.  Check in was a breeze and the staff were quite pleasant.  The rooms themselves were nothing special, but certainly functional with good wifi.  It certainly served its purpose for one-night, though I'm not sure I'd want to be here for a longer stay.  However, the bar in the lobby has a fantastic selection of beers and wines.  My main concern with the hotel has to do with the complimentary shuttle to the airport.  I asked the concierge how long it would take to get there in the morning and was told that the shuttles left every 20 minutes and it would take 15 mins to get to the United terminal at LAX.  However, once I got on the bus, there were numerous signs that said to;3
Nice resort for business, I spend a day in the and I had free breakfast and some discount for dinner which it's really nice. The resort has a pool and very friendly people working in there. The advantage I If you are traveling it just spending a night it's perfect because it's really close to the airport.;4
Very nice hotel &conviniet .the hotel have shutele from the air port .even to the rental cars. The lobby very nice the breakfast tasty they have every thing what we need .the parking free .the beds very well. The price for this hotel i thik cheep and good price. The hotel far from the city like 20to 30 mn I think it's good hotel with good price;4
I stayed at the Four Points LAX overnight  before a Mexico cruise leaving from San Pedro.  The Four Points was convenient for the proximity to the airport and 24 hour free shuttle to and from.  The room was spacious and clean, and the bed was quite comfortable.  The bathrooms could stand to be upgraded.  The bathroom is narrow and the shower is tiny.  Free bottled water, coffee and wifi in the rooms.  The downstairs restaurant has both buffet and menu breakfast.  I would use this hotel again for overnights when I need to be near LAX.;3
I've stayed at Four Points LAX several times in the past, but this was the first time that I booked a room through Hotel Tonight. It was $30 cheaper than booking through SPG and too late to ask for the price guarantee.  While the shuttle arrived quickly at LAX, I was given a room without windows facing outside. Basically I am just facing a hallway and can't see outside. I got a feeling the receptionist hated me, and I got that confirmed once I saw my room.  Other than that, the beds are comfortable and there's free internet, but make sure to get a room with windows if you want to be able to look outside.;3
We stayed here twice in the past few weeks. Used the Sheraton as a layover before our overseas flight to Tahiti. The hotel is very clean, and for the most part, what you would expect for a Sheraton. My only concern was that the rooms were on the small side and the bathrooms in the two different rooms we had were tiny and odd shaped. It is apparent that this was not a Sheraton built hotel, but taken over at some period in it's history.;4
We have stayed at this property a few times and are SPG members using reward points for our stay. The hotel has 24 hour airport shuttle and the staff is very professional and quick to respond to any request. Room was a king on the SPG floor and was very roomy and comfortable. Bathroom was large but could use some updating. Also room had free internet which worked well. Hotel charges $25 per day for self parking, but we were able to find free street parking all 3 days we were here within a 10 minute walk. There is a Denny's a short walk away and Budget Rental Car directly across the street next to a Burger King. Overall a nice hotel and would stay again. Only negative is the cost to park if you choose to use their lot.;4
Upon entering, the lobby was modern and inviting. A great place to hang out and get a little work done or meet up with others. Enjoyed the bar for dinner and a hockey game - the food was good and the wait staff very friendly.   The room was rougher. Another review describes the room as shabby, and that's a perfect adjective. The carpet seemed old and frayed, a picture was missing from the wall in the room with the dirty outline of the frame and exposed hanging brackets left in the void, grout needed replacing, furniture with lots of miles on it, etc. I felt that it was clean, but just worn.   It was a great rate so near the airport, but I have to admit that I'm surprised the Sheraton would put their name on it. Maybe they're close to doing a remodel and aren't doing much to the;2
My co-worker and I chose to stay at this hotel because of its proximity to LAX and because we trust the Sheraton brand.  Well, after our stay at the Four Points, I no longer wish to stay at a Sheraton hotel again.  When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the modern style lobby and were looking forward to relaxing in our rooms after a long day.  There were two people ahead of us at the reception desk.  Both had complaints regarding their stay.  One gentleman in particular told us on his way out that it had been a disastrous stay.  My co-worker and I just thought he was being too critical.  That should have been our first red flag.  We checked in with no problems and were sent up to the 7th floor to find our rooms, except after walking up and down the hall we couldn't;1
if you have an early flight do not stay in this hotel, not hot wáter, not confortable, no one indicate directions to get to my room, it is a funny door with a sign exit, I couldnt imagine the room will be located after the door.;1
We were on a long trip and picked LA as a place to adjust to changing multiple time zones. The Four Points was clean, comfy, and cozy. The beds were outstanding. Customer service is great. There is a bar with a large dining area that you can order food off hours as well. The food and service there were outstanding as well. I would definitely stay in this hotel when in LA again.;5
"I paid $50 premium for the 24 hour check in/out for 9:30am. Arrived 9:50am and was told they ""oversold"" last night and didn't have my room ready, check back in 15 mins. 20 mins later they gave me a double bed room when I had reserved a King, and they said the King would be 2 hours more. Offered buffet or lunch coupon and was nice about it, but still didn't get what I paid for. I did get a ""Deluxe"" room that I had reserved, but 3 years ago gave this hotel a great review. Now the rooms are very run down, furniture is torn up, gashes dings, carpet is old and smells, not enough electrical outlets at all, and small TV, like 32"" not the 40"" that most hotels have. I was VERY disappointed in the condition of this hotel and them not honoring the reservation. It always is a busy hotel and";1
We just had to stay by the airport to catch a very early flight because we live 2 hours from LAX. We decided to drive to LA and do the one week park and fly package that this hotel offered. The hotel had really nicely appointed common areas, an open bar concept in the lobby, a nice looking pool and cabana area right outside and a fast and easy check in. The staff were very friendly and helpful, we had a couple of drinks at the bar and some snacks, and the food was good. The room was a little bit less appealing because the bathroom was small and the shower head was set so low my husband had to duck down to wash his hair. The vanity only had one sink which was OK, but the counter was so low that it was almost sitting height, he's tall so he had to stoop to use the sink. The room;4
I had an issue with a reservation, that four points employees were able to resolve completely. I am so happy that my reservation and stay worked out the way it did. I will definitely come back. Had the reservation not been handled the way it was, my daughter would have been stranded at the hotel without a room in a large city she has never been to before.;5
"I cut airport hotels a fair amount of slack because they're short stay, high turnover etc so its unreasonable to expect too much. But this is a poor example of the type - the key word is 'shabby;' carpets, room fittings etc were old and tired.   The rooms on the outside have a standard courtyard design familiar to anyone who uses Embassy Suites - this means that the windows look out onto a depressing corridor. If you forget to draw the blinds, people walking past can see in, so something to bear in mind for single or nervous travellers.  When I checked in, there weren't enough Reception staff; ok, it happens but at 10:30 at night, it does test your patience to spend 15 minutes waiting to be served. The first room they gave me, the a/c didn't work; the engineer came up, told me";1
We book this hotel for as a place for our 13 hour transit in Los Angeles. Choose this hotel because its close location to Airport. We arrived at 9 am in the morning and even though this is an airport hotel, they couldn't accommodate for early check-in.  Hats off the concierge, we still can store our luggage and also took a 4.5 hour tour downtown (Venice Beach - Hollywood Boulevard - Farmer's Market).  The room is clean and has free wifi.  We went back to airport using the free shuttle.;3
The room has been updated some time ago. It is an old hotel.  The room was very basic. We stayed two nights and two different rooms.Check in line was long both times we were there. One of  the beds was only half made. It was missing a sheet of the bottom half. One of my pillows was smelly. Both rooms had no place to charge your phone by the bed. In one the charging station on the desk was missing- just an empty hole. Some lights in the hallway were blinking...The Staff is super helpful, particularly in the restaurant. and breakfast was great. I gave three stars because the room had hot water, it was generally clean and the staff was super nice.;3
DO NOT STAY HERE  THEY CHARGED US $300+ FOR A NIGHT WE DID NOT STAY HERE  We contacted the guest services upon our return no one can do a thing about it and they are not even trying to they keep passing the buck!  They charged us for a room TWO days before we even stayed  Manager was on a break and wouldn't take the time to come address our issue  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE  NEVER STAYING WITH THEM AGAIN  ALWAYS STAY HILTON;1
We have used this hotel quite regularly for several years when flying out of LAX and have utilized either their own parking/sleep package or ParkSleepFly.com.  I don't know what has happened since the last time we stayed, but this experience was a total nightmare.  To begin with, it took 3 attempts to get keycards that worked so we both ended up going back to reception.  Second, we got one of the crappy rooms that are like a motel with the enclosed corridor outside the door.  It was so noisy and very unrelaxing - the whole point of staying is to be in vacation mode when you arrive at the airport.  The Brewsters Bar staff could barely speak English and were very unattentive, they have a large beer menu which is apparently out of date as everything we asked for they didn't have.;2
We flew in and out of LAX in April of 2015 - as the fares were significantly cheaper than they were into San Diego, which is where we spent our week.  We wanted to see a bit of Los Angeles before traveling back to Ottawa, and needed a place to spend the night prior to our flight home.  I used Booking.com to find a hotel, and the Four Points was being offered at a decent price (relatively speaking).   Overall I would have to say that we were very disappointed with the room.  It was smaller than most rooms you would typically find at some of the less expensive chains such as Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn etc.  Very very basic, paper thin walls, not very clean, and really more like the quality of a road side motel than an actual hotel.  The lobby and the restaurant were quite nice;3
Stayed here one night connecting flights. The location by the airport was perfect for my purpose, the shuttle runs every 15-20 minutes so about 30 minutes after plane doors opened I was in my room. The room was clean and fresh and appeared renovated. Nice quality bed and work desk.   If you are light sleeper, you might want to request a room towards the back since there is some amount of early morning traffice noise on the street side. Not too bad though.  I would probably stay here again if connecting, but not for visiting LA itself.;4
I killed a day here waiting for an extra late red-eye. My room was a good size and clean - no issues with the bathroom or anything else for that matter like I saw in other posts. The pool was surprisingly nice. It was a large size and had cabanas for shade. I also ate a couple meals there and the food was good for an airport hotel. All the staff I encountered were helpful and pleasant. The shuttle comes around every 15-20 minutes and was easy to navigate to LAX.  I'd stay here again if I need a room near LAX in the future.;4
I was very impressed by how organized and client driven catering manager Mariano Valverde was during the planning process for a conference I hosted for 200 attendees. Mariano went above and beyond to ensure that my event was a success from start to finish. He was very attentive and personable! I host conferences in different cities and this was by far the best experience I've had! The event received raved reviews, and it would not have been a success without Mariano and The Four Points by Sheraton-LAX staff. If you are looking for a budget friendly and accommodating venue, then look no further! You and your guest will not be disappointed.  The hotel was reasonably price and close to the airport. The bed was comfortable  and the food was EXCELLENT!! I typically rent a car to do;5
Hotel was nice. The location was convenient to stay by the airport, but not the best location if you want to be right in the heart of all the Los Angeles attractions. Still, they offered tours and services that help you see and do all you want. I'd recommend the hotel. Room was good.;4
Had an amazing stay the staff and manager Lawrence are super friendly and provided great hospitality. The rooms are spacious and clean. Great place to stay after a long flight or before a trip!! Thank you sheraton for such a great stay.;5
We spent the night here before heading out on a Carnival Cruise.  While we stayed in the older part of the hotel, I was able to get a great deal through Travelocity.  The room was quiet and clean.  The bed and pillows were super comfy.  Flying with my husband and teen, I always shop for rooms with two queen beds and this fit our needs.  The transportation from the airport was a breeze which is a plus given this size and traffic at LAX.;3
It needs renovation. Bed cover were dirty. Although the manager said sorry and they changed them still you feel that hotel is not clean.  If you need a refrigerator you have to pay 10 dollars extera per night!  Location is away from everything except the sirport.  I hate my stay there.;1
We stayed here the night before our early flight the next day. Check-In was quick and easy, nice service. The hotel is clean, but the room was worn down, especially the bathroom. The shower was very bad, tub that wouldn't drain and leaked!  For one night and the price it would do, however, next time I will spend a few more dollars and stay elsewhere.;3
We had a one night layover before our flight to Maui and we chose this hotel based on price.  Big mistake.    Two positives - the shuttle service was on time and quick and the lobby has been well taken care of and is clean.    All the negatives - the rooms need major renovations and look like they are from the 80's with popcorn ceilings and very small bathrooms.  The beds are spring mattresses and make a lot of noise as you roll all over the place to get comfortable.    I wouldn't stay here again.;2
We arrived late at night without a reservation. At first it didn't look like we could get in. Then Julian and Martha found us a room at a good price and made us feel welcomed.  They also have a 24 hour shuttle to the airport.;5
Pros:  1) Airport shuttle was convenient and comes regularly (every 10-15 minutes).  2) 24-hour check-in is a great feature. (Note: If you need this, be sure to book 48 hours in advance. I booked the day prior online and my room wasn't ready upon arrival). 3) Comfortable bed. 4) Various excursions can be arranged onsite (for a fee, of course).  Cons:  1) I stayed on one of the higher floors and there was a very odd smell in the hallway for my entire stay. 2) Slow elevator. 3) The room was NOT what I expected to get for $189 per night. The wallpaper was peeling, the floors seemed grungy, and the bathroom looked like something from a college dorm. I kept my shoes on... 4) TERRIBLE wifi! I even tried going to the lobby to connect - it was no better there. I had to wait to get to;2
We checked in very late after a long flight. Though I mentioned I was an SPG member, this comment was disregarded, perhaps because I had booked through a 3rd party. The East Tower room we were given, though large and seemingly clean, had a window that overlooked the hallway!!!! The bathroom was very dated and in need of TLC.I was too tired to protest. The next morning I looked onto the rug and there was a cockroach! It was promptly squished under a shoe, security called and a report taken. Told to see manager when I checked out, which was almost immediately after the incident. I went to front desk and told to wait. After 10 minutes I raised a very vocal protest about the wait and the fact that I had a cockroach in my room. The manager suddenly did show up, apologized, agreed;1
We stayed here on a stopover during our trip to Southeast Asia. The hotel is super convenient for a short stay in LA, as it is just next to the airport and has a free shuttle bus. They even let us check in very early at no extra cost!;4
Shuttle bus driver complained regarding taking ski bags on board stating that was not a class of luggage that was allowed, however there was no indication on the website that this was the case. He still took the bag and on the return journey a different driver did not have an issue. Luggage storage not complimentary for greater than one day (stored for 3 days) even though we had a returning booking (understandable if no future booking in place). Room numbering not consecutive (odd numbers and even numbers in separate wings making tired travellers confused). Room booked for 2 persons and only one small complimentary bottle of water, cracked basin in bathroom, odd rooms with windows (rather than solid wall) facing enclosed corridors therefore no natural light or view from room and;3
Close to the airport, 5 min by shuttle that runs every 20 min. Average room and service. Many towels, some are rough. Comfortable bed. Fast wifi. Breakfast at 6pm: $21 buffet, ala carte will total the same after ordering juice and coffee. Dinner can also be buffet or ala carte, until 10pm, average taste. Across the street is Budget Rental Car. Good location for tour pick up. Many staff roaming around but do not appear eager to help. Calls to guest services are answered fast, not helpful either. When I checked out at 4 am, no one at the desk, no button to ring. Staff was laughing at the back office.;3
After we drove for 5 hours and finally arrived at this hotel, I was looking for a lady's room. The hotel staff looked so indifferent and used his finger to point in the air and also cleaned his teeth. After I asked again where exactly was the restroom, the staff looked so annoyed and put a face. I felt it was inconvenient him to tell me where was the restroom.  Later we found the internet not stable and got disconnected several times and called for assistance, try to know if there was a paid service. The staff was rude and transferred me to an outsourced IT company which only led to the voice mail. At 12:12 a.m. with loads of work undone, we felt so frustrated. The staff later shouted at us saying they not able to further the conversation over the phone because we complained of;1
The room we were assigned on a recent trip was a stripped down version of what we have gotten in the past -- but for about the same money.  Gone was the La-Z-Boy knock-off, and gone was the refrigerator.  We know the hotel, having stayed there several times, so there were no general surprises -- just the sense that we'd been had as when you pick a breakfast cereral off the shelf in the grocery store and notice they've (once again) reduced the number of ounces of product in the box but charged the same or a bit more.  All that said, the location is great.;3
"It's always a pleasure to meet competent staff who welcome you with grace. Lobby is appealing; rooms are OK. The hotel doesn't claim to be a W so I'm satisfied with the value. I wish there was easier to access the parking lot (or maybe I didn't see one). I walked where cars enter/exit.";4
This is the second time I stay at this hotel. There is no words to describe how bad the service was. The AC in my room was non existent. Twice I reported it and both times I waited for than half an hour for someone to come and check it. I had no room service menu, no door signs and graffiti on the walls. When I asked for quarters to do laundry, no one had any to give me. This was by far the worst stay I had in a Sheraton hotel...;1
We flew in from Australia at 8AM and stayed at the Four Points until our next redeye flight to DC that evening. Had to wait a bit for the shuttle (though it was awesome they had one!), but check-in was smooth. I wish the minimum rate for 24-hour check-in wasn't so high. The room was kinda blah -- really old small bathroom. Tiny old bedroom. All we did was sleep though, so it was ok. Cleaning staff woke us up, which was annoying. Would recommend for the 24-hour checkin feature, but not otherwise.;3
Not sure if it was because we had airline voucher but had a very average room no more than 2 star . Was shocked this was a Sheraton . We arrive at 3.30 am exhausted as it had taken 9 hours to get from Las Vegas. At 8.45 we were woken by house keeping to do the room.  Breakfast was really average . I really am shocked this is a spg hotel;1
there wasnt anyone this year at anyplace ive stayed that was as professional,efficient,or as helpful as trish at the front desk,and i want to be sure that the management at the hotel is aware of that fact!!!!!;3
Staff very helpful, slept very well , good location , transfer free to the airport  Arrived very late but it was no problem to go to the hotel , fast check in and the room was also very nice clean and not noisy at all;4
Made a quick overnight stop here before picking up our rental car. We had a suite and it was clean and spacious with the basic aminiaties needed for an airport stop over.   Rental cars are a 5 min walk across the road so handy if you need to collect.   Breakfast was basic but good quality and included in our rate.   Air con in the room was a bit dodgy and made a dripping noise that kept us up a little hence the average review.   Staff were all friendly;3
Only good thing I can say is the 24 hr checkin & staff at reception lovely. Room was tired, no fridge, when I went to reception & explained that for the amount we were paying I thought we would have a fridge we were given one at no cost which was nice. We had to carry our bags to room as conceige wouldn't let us use the trolley. The guys on this front desk except for 1 or 2 were unhelpful and uncommunicative. Wifi hardly worked. Food was expensive, and there is nowhere close by. Our room charge of over $240 AU did not include breakfast! I suggest waiting to get to airport as they have good quality well priced meals there if you can wait. Appalling hotel for the Sheraton brand.;1
used shuttle from Airport The hotel is not to my expectation every hot place is far from here. Santa Monica - we used bus No.3 to reach and come back. Rooms were not that great Staffs were not friendly except one senior person at bell desk. it doesnt seem to be a SPg hotel.;3
We've stayed here on several occasions due to the 24 hour check-in and the proximity to LAX. There's no doubting the hotel is a little tired, but we've always found it clean and quiet.  The only reason we don't give a better rating is due to being disturbed 5 times by house keeping and the chamber maids during our stay on Wed. As we had the room booked till 3pm, we didn't feel the need to put the 'do not disturb' sign out. However after the chamber maids knocked and entered twice before 9am, we thought we'd better put the sign on the door. We had another knock several hours later and two phonecalls from house keeping asking when we were checking out. Whilst all were polite and apologetic, we feel that better communication between the check in desk and house keeping would have;3
Honestly, this hotel is very dated, dark and just completely worn out! The lobby area was deceptively updated, but the room size and quality is comparable to a LaQuinta, but at a much higher rate!  We stayed (thank goodness) for a single night before our early morning departure out of LAX.  Our room smelled of artificial air freshener (not good) and was small, dark, and sparsely furnished, but I will say, the king size bed was fairly comfortable.  As for the service, we called down twice to have extra pillows brought to the room...when they finally showed up 45 minutes later, we were delivered....a mini-refrigerator???  We sent the fridge away and called a 3rd time to get the pillows which were finally brought to the room.  Also, there is a small store/gift ship in the hotel;2
"If you need a place to stay on the West side of Los Angeles, then the Four Points by Sheraton just might be for you.  This is a basic hotel, very moderately priced, yet is clean, comfortable, and has a very friendly and caring staff.  My room was on the 6th floor, and was bedded King.   The furniture, certainly not brand new, but was in good condition.  The desk was large and connected to the dresser and had an excellent desk lamp.  There were 2 desk level outlets, albeit a bit hidden behind the 43"" TV.  The WI-Fi appeared to be included for all guests and the signal was strong and supported multiple devices quite easily.  The bed was comfortable however, the TV was at a slightly odd angle because I think the furniture was of older construction and probably designed for an older";4
"We stayed here because a bridge tournament was hosted here. Room was clean, but the room and the furniture were sparse and dated -- e.g. no chair other than the desk chair; no dresser; dated mattress and bedding. Towels were thin, limp, and dingy. If you are looking for a place to crash before or after a flight, this hotel would be OK. If you are looking for anything else, this probably is not for you.";2
Our large group arrived - everyone with confirmations and deposits taken - and yet they did not have rooms for us.  The previous day we confirmed our stay with the hotel and there are emails to back that up.  With some of the most brutal customer service I've ever experienced - our check in took 7 hours! We tried to find a different hotel, however there were no vacancies anywhere near LAX. My understanding is that they overbook the hotel on a regular basis, as we overheard this happening to others.   We were in town for a hockey tournament so there was a lot of children involved.  Some of the rooms had dirty linens and towels, blood stains and poor condition overall.  Add to that the drugs that our boys found under their bed - it was turned over to the hotel and they called the;1
My husband and I stayed at this hotel at both the beginning and end of a two week international vacation. We had very different experiences on either end.   Overall I will offer that the common areas are updated and new. We used the shuttle service both to and from the airport on both occasions and found it took much longer than 15-20 minutes to arrive as advertised. Also, LAX is undergoing major construction. Not the hotel's fault, but it took us almost 40 minutes to get to our terminal in the morning. The shuttle stops at another hotel, and dependent upon who's on your shuttle you'll be stopping at all the terminals as well. Just be sure to allot time. Also, just know check-in will take a bit if you arrive with the shuttle, as a number of people will be getting off with you.;3
We had a group reservation that was canceled even though we had paid deposit and had paper proof of the reservation. We had to wait 3 hours to get that sorted out. The hotel smelled like weed.  After we checked in, one of our rooms had  a bag of cocaine stuck in the mattress left by the previous guests... we proceeded to call the police. No help from the hotel. I will never book there again. Horrible experience.;1
"Arrived around midnight to check-in for a two night stay, and there was a bit of a delay to check-in, as I arrived with a few other guests and some airline crews.  Once I got to check-in, however, it was very quick and was able to get to my room without much hassle.  The location of the hotel is convenient, especially getting to and from the airport, as the hotel does provide a free shuttle service that runs every 15-20 minutes or so.  However, the hotel definitely shows it age - the wallpaper seemed to be peeling off in certain places near the windows, and it just didn't feel as ""homey"" as I've felt in other hotels.  Hotel does have a restaurant for breakfast and dinner - I only dined there for breakfast, but they have a pretty good-sized set menu and buffet for reasonable";3
We didn't see any of the hotel beyond the front desk, so other than the room and service we received, I can't say much.  I will say that when we got into our room it was quite nice.  We did have an issue with the AC as it was not cooling at all.  A phone call to the front desk brought Luis right up.  He quickly found the issue and got us fixed up in no time at all and the room cooled off in minutes.  We had a good experience here for our quick one-night stay.;4
Location - superb, Check In - very fast and friendly, Staff - very happy and personable, Room - nowhere near what the brochures and advertising show, but a very comfortable bed, and good toiletries in bathroom. towels jaded. The room was clean and comfortable but A/C troubelsome. So what was wrong? No outside window, an internal window overlooked a passageway outside your room;3
I needed a hotel room prior to a very early flight the next AM, so I booked a room here.  Arrived at 10P & the parking lot, located in the back, could have been lit better, especially for females walking.  All looked ok upon entering the property & the desk agent was very pleasant.  However, when I got up to my room & went in, the room was dirty.  Not sure if someone was still in it or not. Looked like it just didn't get cleaned when someone else checked out.  Awkward!  Went back down to front desk & was able to bypass a line and get assigned to another room.  Agent felt bad & offered me dinner....I already ate as its late!   Was then offered a $15 credit in the bar/restaurant.  It's 10:30P & I'm leaving at 5 AM.  I just wanted a Diet Coke!  Went back up to the new room....& the;1
After a 14 hour flight from Australia I needed the day use of a hotel room for a shower and rest. Four Points sounded good and close to the airport. Unfortunately the room I had was not soundproof or comfortable. There was no hot water and the reception staff were definitely not helpful. Will not use this hotel during future stopovers.;2
I stayed 3 days in the Four Points by Sheraton and chose the hotel based on location to the airport. Had a very nice visit, the room was quiet and clean. I planned to use the pool but was distracted by numerous meetings ... the parking was a surprise to me. In addition to the room price, I had to pay an additional $19/day for parking. We went to the beach while staying here, and enjoyed the boardwalk at Muscle Beach - very interesting crowd!;5
"I would like to start by commending Asst Manager Lawrence for being so gracious with helping me with my reservation. I truly appreciated his assistance.   The hotel is conveniently located outside of LAX. It's a large hotel with multiple conference rooms, so there is a lot of traffic in the lobby.   The room is standard. It was very clean and had all the  regular amenities. I stayed in a ""deluxe king"" which was quite small, and there was nothing deluxe about it. It costs more since there is one king bed instead of two doubles.   The only downfall is hotel guests have to pay $21/day for parking.";3
This place is a scam! Charged me for a fraudulent smoking charge and accused me of having a party. Full story below! Checked in for one night with my gf, because her daughter was admitted to UCLA medical center. Lupe at the front desk was very nice and gave me a complementary parking pass along with breakfast vouchers,  this is just one of their scams because I later found out  we were charged full price even though we presented the vouchers for breakfast and parking. These vouchers are a trap they will still change you regardless! When we first entered our room we immediately noticed the smell of smoke. I thought we accidentally booked a smoking room. I then opened the window and when I looked out I saw that down to the left, some of the hotel staff had a bench against the;1
A group of us are staying this weekend and I am so blown away by the exceptional customer service. Martin at the front desk went out his way to take care of all our concerns. He was patience as we figured out a bunch of logistics and was just totally friendly. I felt we were guests at his house. Thank you!;5
This hotel is conveniently located near LAX and I've stayed here before. I was actually standing in line for more then 20 minutes waiting to check in, the funny part is that people that weren't SPG members were in the SPG lone booking rooms, not to mention over 40 minutes waiting for the shuttle.;1
We had reserved an early check-in after an overnight flight from Australia. We were in our nice room by 9.30 am which was fantastic service. They also have a good heated outdoor pool. Our 2nd stay here and will definitely be back.;4
I stayed at the Sheraton gateway a couple of weeks ago which is around the corner which is kind of rundown, and this four points makes the Sheraton look luxurious by comparison.  They have a valet in theory but he never came out to help us park at 11:30 at night.  I self parked out back which wasn't too bad, $24/day for self parking.    We went in and the smell of this rundown hotel was quickly apparent.   The smell of exhaust and oil in the elevator was so bad that I could barely breathe.     The room itself was tough.  Light switches aren't hooked to any of the lamps.  Have to walk around to each lamp to turn it on and off.  Definitely hear the planes worse than the Sheraton.  All the furniture is just cheap.  The shower is pretty narrow.  I appreciated strong water flow but;2
good, beds, shuttle every 20 minutes,  for each terminal  there was 1 elevator  working and  2 never worked during my stay  nobody seemed to care  the spg gold status only gave me 1 apple juice and  some pretzels  but overall  it is close to the airport;3
On a 14 hour layover in Los Angeles I thought I had made a day room reservation but the hotel had no record of it.  However.... the staff at the reception desk were exceedingly helpful (thanks Trish) and were able to get us in for the same great rate and also included a $10 coupon for a drink in the bar to help ease our stress.  The hotel was conveniently located close to LAX with a free shuttle and the day room allowed us access to the pool and fitness centre.  The room was a little dated but was clean and certainly fit the bill for what we needed.;4
Stayed here for one night on a lay over waiting for a cruise out of San Pedro  First impression is from the outside ok typical Sheraton hotel Came in at noon room was not ready no problem expected this Disappointed was we had to sag our bags around for an hour with no offer to check with a Bellman. No big deal  Had lunch in the only restaurant  good value huge portion good service  Talked to concierge to arrange a tour of LA  very good service Got a good tour for a discount for 5 hours on VIP tours And also arrange LImo to San Pedro for also a discount  15 dollars more than a bus of people  Impressive work   Now the room was ready on the second floor across from the pool  Pool was not used winter too cold out but available Room was ok nothing special lay out ok  a bit worn but;3
This a great hotel for location, quality, and value also.  Everything we experienced from tho the staff, to the amenities was great.  The bed was very comfortable and room was well designed and equipped.  The only problem is that sounds carry too well through the walls.  I heard three separate conversations from surrounding rooms.  Plumbing noises, footsteps, etc were enough to cause a lack of sleep for even myself who is usually a heavy sleeper.    We may have had bad luck with noisy neighbors, but if you're a light sleeper, you may want to keep this in mind.  Car parking is $21 per night.;4
Just around the corner from LAX, a comfortable bed, airport shuttle and complimentary in room wi-fi: perfect for a one night stay if you don't need five star luxury.   Had no problems with the shuttles (Four Points and Renaissance share a shuttle). You just walk straight out of the terminal from the baggage carousel and look for the red shuttle signs, easy to find. Caught them at 7am and 1am, on both occasions the waits were about 15-20 mins. LAX felt safe waiting, even late at night. Shuttle drivers were courteous and helpful.   Stayed at Four Points twice, the first time in a standard room facing an internal corridor. Arrived about 8am after a long haul flight and we just wanted to sleep for a few hours, however housekeeping tried entering three times in as many hours even;4
Stayed here for less than 5 hours after a long flight from Asia and before an early flight home the next morning.  Had to wait a while for shuttle and check in took a long time as there were many people checking in and only two clerks. Check in took nearly an hour and it was midnight before I got to my room.  Rooms are basic and dated, but it was clean.  Within minutes of getting to my room, there were loud noises and music coming from the room next door.  The music stopped and then the sounds became louder and louder and the things I heard made me fear for my safety.  I went back to the desk and reported what I heard and asked for security to check their room.  When I returned to the floor, you could hear the sounds as far away as the elevator.  There was a maintenance man near;2
Have used this hotel many times.  Very convenient hotel.... -close to the airport -free shuttle to and from the airport -clean room... not noisy considering it being close to the airport -Budget across the road, so if you renting a car get from there. Makes it so much more easier and convenient. -has a coin laundry which was handy  Will be using this hotel again on a future visit.;5
Good place for your commuter to LA airport and going to downtown. Pros: free bus to airport and wonderful breakfast  Cons: the LA is a little messy and dirty. Overall the best place for you to travel from airport of LA.;4
Four Points by Sheraton offers an upscale stay for a very affordable price. Located less than a mile from LAX, this hotel has 24 hour airport shuttle service and is a great place to stay if your flight is delayed overnight.;5
Ok so checked in, looked ok but was very rude staff on reception , thought not much of it as its LA  Rooms are OK a little basic but they do their job  Worst thing is they have No sound insulation at all which for an airport hotel is just terrible   I complained and got moved rooms away from the runway side (as plane was taking off every 5 minutes) which was better  And cancelled second night and moved more downtown   But generally the condition of this hotel and attitude of staff make me recommend to try the other multiple options u have here in area   Invest an extra £20 and enjoy some quite and decent service   This is just bad, sorry;1
When flying to LAX from the east coast, and arriving in the wee hours of the morning, it's always safer to stay the night vs. driving home.  So, as SPG members, we always try to stay at one of their LAX properties.  This visit, however, was an eye opener.  The hotel was not full, but we were offered no upgrade.  The room was tiny, and looked worn.  When we entered the room overlooking the parking lot, it was very hot!  The window had been left open.  It took almost an hour for the room to cool to 70 degrees after I closed the windows. The room was tidy, but askew.  The shade on a large lamp behind the small corner chair was tilted and clearly broken.  Inl lieu of a dresser, there is a TV/desk, with a few removeable baskets to take the place of drawers.  The baskets are so tiny;3
I just completed an overnight stay at this hotel and was very pleased with the experience. The staff were courteous and helpful. The location is approx. one mile away from LAX with complimentary shuttle service to/from the hotel every 15 minutes 24/7. It is also within walking distance to a number of rental car spots. Highly recommended!;5
Needed a hotel close to LAX for an overnight layover while traveling to Mexcio. This hotel was solid.  It provided a clean room at a reasonable price for the night. Service was quick and polite at check in.  Shuttle runs every 15 minutes and is free. Overall a very solid place to stay for an evening.  No complaints.;5
Just about everything was exceptionally sub standard about this hotel, the room, the Internet, the common areas. You must book a deluxe room to get a room with a window to the outside rather than overlook the narrow public corridor, the Internet was a joke and we tried all over to get a decent signal, the room was shabby and worn out. Somebody had tried to slop a bit of paint here and there which was like putting lipstick on without brushing your teeth. The cookies were delicious, though.;2
This was my second stay on Four Points by Sheraton LAX. The first time i had a room almost inside the laundry, old and smelly for 99usd plus tax a night. I decided to give it a try again and made my reservation with 7.000 SPG points for one night before leaving to SFO. Well, this time a got a room with a view, spg floor and no different smells... The experience was better and probably i'd come back for a 3rd stay. Nice hotel for 1 or 2 nights when you're in transit.;3
Our stay was for overnight and to get sound sleep for early morning flight.  Service is ok. We were given keys to room where guest was already sleeping. It was very unfortunate episode and resulted into stressful situation for my family. Hotel front office manager Lupin did give us 50% refund on our room rate but that's not enough or make up for what we had to go through. Note that we checked in at 8 in evening so it's not busiest time for any hotel  Rooms are big but it has issues, heating doesn't work  but we were so tiered that we figured to just sleep as much as we can.  We were woke up at least twice due to lot of noise outside our room , guest either  yelling or talking loudly not sure as it was pretty early time and I was very sleepy.  This establishment is cheap 3 star;2
I enjoyed our one night stop over at this hotel. We found it conveniently close to LAX terminals and appreciate the free shuttle from LAX that is easy to board from red sign marked 'hotel shuttles' straight in front of the arrival terminals. Sheraton beds are always comfortable and this was very welcome after a long international flight. Room service food was high quality and plentiful in volume on plates. Hotel room was quiet with shuttles arriving every 15-20 minutes as promised for airport transfer.;4
We booked this hotel as we were flying out early. I guess a lot of airlines also use this hotel for their staff. Having a shuttle with the airport is very convenient. The price is reasonable for the hotel in LA.;3
Stayed for a night on a quick LA trip.  Hotel staff friendly, room clean and adequate.  Had issues with the coffee maker not working and they were quick to come replace it for me.  Had dinner in the lounge, very good food.  Bed was comfortable.  Close to the airport so a bit noisy.;3
Very nice hotel,my room was lovely,I had nice breakfast in the hotel but the highlight of my stay was dining at the restaurant Brewster which is in the hotel,the grilled Salmon Burger was a perfect ending to my stay.. One of the best burgers I've ever had.;4
Four Points LAX is the best SPG hotel near LAX. Wifi is fast and free. No password is required. Shuttle to LAX is available every 30 minutes (it takes about 15 minutes to the airport). Room is equipped with refrigerator, LCD TV, and several outlets on the table. Fitness center on the ground floor has three treadmills, static bikes, and weight lifting machine.;5
This is a nice hotel - free shuttle from the airport - convenient, clean, friendly staff and the rooms are comfortable. However, we will not be able to stay here again due to the 'free' wifi. It doesn't work . . . at all. We ended up going to the nearby Marriott for coffee so we could use their wifi. A real inconvenience for the holiday traveler and a show stopper for the business traveler. Hope they can get this fixed or they will continue to lose customers.;3
Getting to LAX for an early flight is traumatic enough at the airport let alone the LA freeways! But staying at Sheraton 4Points makes all the difference.  Rooms are clean, free bottled water and wifi, courteous staff and shuttle bus drivers, early opening coffee shop (not complimentary), and frequent shuttles to the airport.  I have stayed here before this time, and will do again.  And they gave me a very good rate for park-n-fly, leaving my car for 7 days in their parking lot.  The total cost was much less that 7 days in a parking structure at LAX.;4
we booked this hotel because of a twelve hour layover in LA. Checked trip advisor reviews first and decided it met our needs. Upon an early arrival that we informed the hotel we would have, they did not immediately have a room for us so we waited a short while so they could get one ready, no big deal we just hung out in their lobby to kill time. Once our room was available we found it more than adequate for our needs. The room was clean, the bathroom was immaculate, we were happy. Spent a few hours in their bar/restaurant and killed time chatting with the bartender. When we were checking out the lovely lady at the desk went out of her way to get us an even better deal because we were given the nightly rate when we booked so she managed to reduce our rate. I wish we remembered;4
"We used this hotel as a layover break on our trip from Ontario Canada to Hawaii.  We had to wait over an hour for the hotel shuttle to arrive. The room was very average...nothing special... We witnessed the most horrific customer service EVER when a very tired family arrived with a voucher from their airline and asked for their room.  The absolutely ignorant customer service rep said there were no rooms ""made up"" at that time....her tone of voice and "" I don't give a damn attitude"" was a disgrace to the FOUR POINTS label to say the least.  This potential customer with her very heavy accent was handed a horrible case of discrimination right before our eyes.  The CSR went to get the manager when the guest asked to speak to the manager since she was ""speaking like she did not";2
Good for overnight stay. Close to the airport, reasonable rates, free Wi-Fi, breakfast available (not complimentary), free shuttle to LAX and they gave us a 1 for 1 free beer at the bar. Room with 2 queen beds was spacious and comfortable for 3 adults.;4
Maybe I should give it 4 points!  We arrived early but as the rooms were not ready until 1 or 2pm they stored our bags and we used time with a walk to the Marriott next door. Room was ready and were given a king at rear of building - didnt bother us too much had a top view of flights on final approach. This is not a large hotel and very popular with asian groups. So dont expect an early checkin.;3
Due to last minute travel arrangements we were desperate to find overnight accommodation at LAX. Given that it was New Year's Eve rooms were in very short supply and rates were increasing by the minute as I served the net at the airport. In any event, although I had to settle to pay way over the odds from the usual rate, this hotel served our purpose very well. Contrary to some other posts, following a swift and courteous check in, our room was clean and quiet (despite overlooking the car park), and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in. It was also a huge relief that a room was ready for us at 11am. There are many countries in Europe where this hotel would have been granted a 5* rating. Our only small gripe was perhaps the prices of the coffee and;5
Stayed one night due to plane having maintenance problems? The airline had a choice of hotels to choose from and we have had good luck with the Sheraton brand so chose this hotel. Lobby is nice and modern. Room was like a 1 star hotel needing updating. Bathroom was tiny and had difficulty getting hot water in shower. I generally would expect more from a theoretically 3 star hotel.;1
"I had been in Australia, and used Los Angeles as a mid-way stop for my return back to Europe. I stopped at this hotel for two nights.  Room: Very spacious en-suite double room. Resembled Hilton Hotel in a way. Room amenities included TV with lots of channels and ""on-demand"" options, although it seemed quite pricey at around $20 to view a movie. The coffee machine was fantastic, and felt like this was a great addition to the room. AC was great.  Lots of storage space, and a study desk.  Service: Both check-in, and check-out were smooth. However, I was not informed of the shuttle bus on either occasion, and therefore caught cabs from/to the airport, although this was very reasonably priced. I did have a minor issue one evening, when I ordered room service and my cans of coke";5
Lovely hotel with very friendly staff.  My room was huge with a queen size bed and the softest pillows in the world!   My only comment would be on the room service. I ordered a cheese pizza and a sprite, it came to nearly $30 without a tip and the pizza was just bread with an excessive amount of cheese.   I would visit again!;4
"I have stayed in motels to high end 6 stars hotel. The room is clean; clean beds and bathroom.  Upon arrival, there is no staff to greet you. Lobby has business-outlook. I got walk around abit to find that the check in area is in the middle of the building. It doesn't have clear indication of ""check-in, check-out, concierge.. .etc""    Shower has strong water pressure which is a plus point. Bathroom looks bare partly because the shower gel & shampoo are located on the wall within bathtub area. So the ususl mini bar soapIt feels like in a public club's bathroom.  Only 1 bottle of mineral water offered. No breakfast inclusive. For the price i paid, i would have booked the 2-3star hotels/motels near LAX which offer free continental breakfast and cost much less. I probably won't come";3
This is a great hotel in lax airport. I have stayed many times in different airport Hotels. All the car rental pick up and return are within walking distance. Free shuttle 24/7. Friendly and helpful staff. I recommend this hotel for overnight stay ay the air-port at a reasonable tariff.;5
Used points to stay over here before flying out of LAX the next morning. I wasn't expecting much beyond a clean room, clean hotel, and maybe a decent hotel bar.  When I checked in, there was some kind of fire drill going on with two fire trucks, and the constant blaring of the alarms.  Apparently someone drove into a pipe or something like that.  I checked in, went to my room (which was clean) then left since the entire hotel was bombarded with the noise.  Before leaving, I mentioned to the desk that there was a refrigerator in the middle of the 4th floor for some reason.  I returned a few hours later - alarms were off, fire trucks gone.  The fridge was still sitting in the same place.  Not exactly classy, is it?;3
We spent a night here while waiting for friends to arrive in LA to start a road trip. The hotel shuttle took a while to arrive at the airport but the traffic was crazy that particular evening. Check in was efficient but as many others have said, the room left a lot to be desired.   Rooms are extremely old and dated (to the point where stains are permanent and they don't look clean) and the windows face an internal corridor so we could hear everything. There was also no privacy if we wanted to pull the blind up and allow some light into the room. Annoyingly, the light in the bathroom was not working - I am not sure how they managed to clean the room without switching this on. When we reported it, we were informed it could not be fixed so we had to move rooms very late in the;3
Used this hotel as a base for our family tour of the US  we are still on your and Four Points LAX is a great hotel. Friendly and so helpful. Makes a difference when you are traveling with children     Nothing was too much trouble and they organized cars and taxis. Just great service. At a very good price.;5
Had a great stay at this hotel. The staff was excellent. Would recommend to anyone needing a hotel at LAX.The front desk staff went out of their way to accommodate our every need. Just returned from a long trip from Japan, and needed an early check-in.;5
Stayed one night having arrived late at LAX. Check-in was super quick, rooms and hotel look great - reception and lounge over look the outdoor pool. Rooms are spacious, recently refurbished with stripy wallpaper and quality wood and chrome furnishings. Bed was amazing...big thick duvet..did not want to get up. Room super quiet - did not hear anyone all night. Room comes with 2 free bottle waters and coffee etc. and free wifi Receptionist gave me a comp breakfast for having to wait 1hour for the hotel shuttle bus - LAX was swamped with holidays travellers. Nice touch. Only negative is that some rooms look out onto an internal corridor so limited privacy if u pull the blind up. Having stayed at other LAX hotels this is comparable in terms of comfort and facilities with other more;5
Check in was efficient and the room was a decent size, as was the bathroom. We arrived later than expected so were unable to try the restaurants.  Bed was comfortable although the air conditioning was quite noisy. Left early to get to the airport which is only a short, free bus shuttle away.;4
I missed my connection in LAX and treated myself to a night in a hotel vs a night sleeping at the airport.   Location is great, about a mile from the airport. They have a shuttle 24 hours day that runs every 15 minutes.   The room and floor left a bit to be desired. Thankfully I had 2 beds as the one bedspread had stains on it. The ice machine on the 4th floor doesn't work, on a normal stay this would be a non issue but at this time I'm wearing a walking boot and need to ice my foot 3 times a day.;4
Not sure where to begin but I'm too exhausted from not sleeping and being treated like an infectious leper that I'll keep this short and sweet. (Hoping no one stays here for the upcoming holidays and ruins their life)  The heater is blasting for a few hours now in my vintage room and it's still freezing. I'm guessing if I sprayed luminol on the vintage carpets, bedspread and drapes, we'd solve countless unsolved mysteries of years past and several hundred guests ago of not laundering things. So, I remain gloriously fascinated in a sick and twisted kind of way, in spite of it all. Freezing. Good thing I packed my parka. It makes for nice pajamas and keeps the ewww factor in check while curled up on the bed with socks on my hands for warmth. To curtail the inner panic of germ;1
Having booked six months out we thought we had paid for the room, but it didn't appear so. We booked for four families travelling together and in a single booking with arrival at different times. The first to arrive had no problems checking in, the next two had to wait for rooms to be ready even though it was late in the day, but when the final family arrived they were refused check in as the person who booked the room wasn't with them! Caused a lot of difficulty with small children.   Overall check in experience did not meet expectations or the standard of the rest of the hotel and first impressions count.  The rooms were very good and the beds comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. The wake up call was on time, important with an early morning flight. The shuttle bus to;4
Everything that could go wrong did and 90% was preventable. I will never stay at a Starwood property again if I can help it. They are doing construction in the wing I am staying in which caused the walls to vibrate on top of the loud construction noise and the baby crying next door. The walls were so thin I could hear the family coughing. Really shut the wing down. They did change my room and give me a free drink, which they could not find at the front desk when I went to redeem it. My new room only had one light bulb in one of the three fixtures. The next morning the card for the parking I am paying $21 a night for wouldn't let me out of the parking lot at 5:15am on my way to a clients and wanted me to pay $24. Then that night the evacuation alarm went off for 4 hours;1
My husband and I just flew in to LAX from spending 8 days in Puerto Vallarta, where we were celebrating our anniversary. We were really looking forward to relaxing in our room and going to bed early but the fire alarm was randomly going off and the hotel could not get it to stop.  This hotel offers park/sleep/fly so we left our car here while we were gone and spent one night before our trip, and the fire alarm went off randomly that night as well.  NEVER STAY HERE!!!;1
"My family and I just stayed here. The restaurant didn't know what ""gluten free"" is (my mom is celiac) so we left. The air conditioning didn't work in the room and the beds are super hard. If you like comfy beds stay away. I'm glad we only stayed one night";2
Nice hotel, very close to the airport. There's a Brewster's restaurant/pub in the hotel which is an added bonus. Food was decent but the drinks were tasty :)  Definitely a business travellers hotel as there were many of us individuals in the pub. Good atmosphere.;4
The hotel itself is nothing to brag about but it's clean, comfortable and offers great service. The hotel itself is a old and the hallways are a bit dark. However, the lobby area though is bright and the breakfast cafe and bar are decent. I have to highlight the service. The front desk staff, the housekeeping and everyone I come into contact with at this hotel is very friendly and provides outstanding service with a smile. Very good rating for the service.;4
My wife and I stayed one night at the Four Points Sheraton Los Angeles Airport hotel upon our return from Tahiti. Tired from our travels, we were able to check into our room a little early. Prior to check-in, we spent some quality time at the outdoor pool soaking up the rays and resting. The rooms were very nice, quiet and contained many of the amenities that we expect from a top rated Sheraton. We had dinner at the restaurant which provided a long list of menu items and good quality food.   One staff member who stood out was Trish. She was an exceptional front desk employee who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. She was so nice that my wife bought her a small gift in the hotel shop.  We travel a lot and this hotel was one of the best airport hotels!;5
I highly recommend staying here if you have an early flight out of LAX.  Very close to terminals at airport.  The hotel hallways, rooms and the bathrooms were standard and a bit dated but we were there to sleep and catch an early flight so the bed was most important and it was very comfortable.  There was a nice outdoor pool but didn't get the chance to use it.  t great perk at this hotel is that you can pay to park here while your out of town and they have a shuttle back and forth to the airport.  This option was priceless to us as the lot was secure and we didn't have to go looking for another place to park early morning before our flight.  Daily prices for parking were the same and even less than some of the other parking places.  When we returned a week later our vehicle;5
The property is decent, the rooms are NOT fresh...  But, I want to share this with you...  if you're traveling on business you may appreciate this.  Never having been in LA, I had an 11 o'clock appointment moved to 1, with my flight schedule for 4 pm, and I couldn't miss it.  I was worried I wouldn't have time to return my car and get to the terminal and thru security to make my flight.    After explaining it to the concierge, Jess who got off at 2:30, he told me not to worry, he would make sure Esteban who comes in after him would have a taxi waiting for me and they would personally make sure the car was returned.  That comfort was an awesome experience, not just knowing that someone gave me help above and beyond their responsibilities, but that they cared!   Long story short,;2
We stayed in this hotel prior to a flight to Thailand Very easy and fast to get from the airport to the hotel with hotel shuttle bus  Ver comfy bed with plenty of pillows and very good mattres for good night sleep prior to taking next flight Very friendly employees;4
I booked this hotel after originally booking another airport hotel as we had a VERY early flight.   Huge mistake.   Originally impressed by the hotel, the lobby is gorgeous - then we got to the rooms.  VERY small, VERY uncomfortable beds and just really unimpressive.  Should have paid an extra $50.00 to actually get some sleep.   I realise that this is a an airport hotel and it was a great rate...but sometimes you get what you pay for.  Sorry For Points, just not impressed at all.;2
Mrs. Rxgeek stayed at this property three times due to its airport proximity. Each stay was worse than the previous. On the first stay, the handle fell off the shower. The hotel refunded the points used to pay for the stay. Everyone deserves a second chance, but the next two stays had numerous problems.  It took 45 minutes and 3 phone calls to get the shuttle from the airport. The wait for check-in took 15 minutes, even with Gold SPG status. Since the clock in the room either was missing or did not work, she called the front desk for a wake up call. However, no one answered the front desk phone. SPG status was not acknowledged on 2 of the 3 stays. With this many issues, perhaps this hotel needs a new manager.;1
Great hotel near less than 20 min from the airport. My first flight was delayed causing me to miss my flight to hawaii. I was given a free night at this hotel. Friendly service. They serve hot and delicious food until 12:30 at night. Food and service from the checkin to the check out was great. Shuttle runs every15-20 min. To and from the hotel.;5
We thought that the room was a nice size and a great large bathroom.  Usually Sheraton Hotels have such small bathroom - - but not at this Hotel.  We thought the Hotel was very clean and comfortable.  We ate lunch and dinner in the bar.  Great food with large portions - - - especially the fish tacos and the salmon burger.  I expected ground salmon - but it was a very large piece of salmon with an abundant amount of great seasoned French fries.;5
We are four people travelling to LA and stayed in two rooms of 2 double beds, both facing the west. Although many reviews complained about noise, none of us was bothered by the noise from the street or the planes. The bathroom appeared a little small because of the non-optimal configuration but it was okay. Beds were okay. We were glad that we booked the hotel just two days in advance and the cost was around $100 each room after tax -- many other hotels around the whole LA area were over $200 even $300 per room.;4
Stayed here while visiting coastline near LAX (sister was looking for a place to live).  Solid enough accommodations near hotel, with decent pool.  Just wish there was a hot tub!  But over course, that might be too much.  Free breakfasts and bar with some actual craft cocktails was welcome too.  It looked like the shuttle was convenient as well.;4
Okay so I was at this hotel in August only for a day as a part of my journey to Fiji. I arrived from the airport in the shuttle bus. There was a long queue at the reception so after a long wait when my turn came I was told that there is no rooms available for another 2 hours even thought I had a confirmed booking. I was asked to wait in the bar cum restaurant next to the reception. I am not normally fussy about these these things but since I had been travelling for the past 28 hours and had another 20 hours to go the next day, I was annoyed to say the least. So I waited in the bar and had a burger and a coffee which were not bad. After that I walked around the hotel. It is a big hotel for a airport hotel and has everything you'd need. So after a 3 hour wait I finally got the key;4
It had been several years that I last stayed here, but this visit was a pleasant surprise. Had a room in the San Diego tower which was well appointed. The desk had a multi-port charging spot so my three devices could charge in one spot and still left room for my laptop plug. Room service order of fish tacos and with side of onion rings was a good choice. The tacos were tasty, the guacamole though was mediocre, but the onion rings were the best. Good coating of batter and crispy but not greasy. Portion was huge for $5! Breakfast was uninspiring, hotcakes were ok but served with cold butter, and room temperature syrup. The breakfast offering could stand upgrade like dinner/bar meals the night before.  Popular crew hotel, but quiet. Staff friendly and helpful.;5
"We found a great deal for the Sheraton by LAX on Trivago offered by Getaroom so we drove 30 minutes to this hotel. When we arrived, we found the Sheraton did not have any rooms, that Getaroom offered us a room w/o even checking Sheraton's inventory! SO NOW WE HAVE NO ROOM BUT IT'S PAID FOR THRU GETAROOM so we have to call the company to cancel the fee. AFTER REACHING ""BARBARA"" AT GETAROOM, WE WERE PUT ON HOLD FOR 15 MINUTES, THEN ASKED MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE NO ROOMS AVAILABLE, THEN PUT ON HOLD FOR ANOTHER 15 MINUTES, THEN TOLD WE WOULD GET A REFUND IN 2 WEEKS. Two weeks?!! So they could use our money interest free?? And after losing an hour to the night driving to hotel with no rooms and then suffering thru another 30 on the phone with this shady company?!!! HORRIBLE COMPANY!";5
"My sweetie and I stayed in this hotel for two nights--on the way to and from Maui.  On the way there, we waited the full 25 minutes for the free shuttle, and arrived at 10pm to a lobby packed with a line of 20 people all wanting to check in--and just one desk clerk.  Everyone was tired and cranky, and we were mostly there to head out in the morning, so their lack of organization cost everyone sleep.  They found another clerk, and a manager stepped in, too.  Our room in the Central tower (there is also an East and a West tower) looked to be a former motel room.  The only ""window"" faced a corridor where people walked by, so we had to close the blinds and had no outside light.  All night long there was a machine droning noise that was so loud that I couldn't sleep--even with";3
The decor of this place is kind of outdated -- beige, beige, and more beige -- but it's convenient, the room was huge and the staff was friendly. The workout room was what you'd expect (just about enough equipment and space for everyone in there) and the shuttle service is easy to flag down.   The bathroom was the highlight of the place -- the water pressure in the shower was divine!  Our only drawback was when we noticed a stain on the sheets that looked like either rust or blood. We called downstairs and asked for new ones, though, and they were quickly brought.   Will we stay again? Probably not, but that's because there's a Westin right next to the car rental place that's a smidge more convenient.;3
I stayed one night after a flight back to LA which landed me at rush hour. The hotel is close to the airport and actually near parking lot C (0.7 mile). The room had free internet, flat screen tv with usual movie choices. The desk (below the TV) has ports for usb charging of items and electric plugs on the desktop (convenient). There is free coffee which can be made up in the room. The bathroom has the usual amenities. I had a handicapped room (perhaps how I appeared after a 5 hour flight) so the soap, shampoo and conditioner were in dispensers on the shower wall. The bed was comfortable. The air conditioner is one of those old types by the window with a fan which can be a bit noisy but you adjust the temp there and not on a wall thermostat.  The carpet looked a bit old but the;4
Arriving late from Cancun decided at the last minute to stay overnight near LAX.  Found this hotel and a new clerk gave us our room only to discover in opening the door that a lady just out of the shower greeted us...we  laughed ( she was a good sport ! ). We were given a new room. Next morning Patty gave us complimentary meals and  an apology Then we were given another apology from the director of operations Mohamed . our party grew and both Mohamed and Peter Kolla the general manager insured that all of our meals were complimentary.  Our Waitress Trish was very efficient and helpful. In all, our visit ended in a positive note and the staff's efficiency made up for a simple mistake.  We all laughed as we enjoyed the delicious meal !;4
Lots and lots and lots of road noise.  Lots and lots and lots of TV noise.  At 3:00 am could hear TV's from other rooms like they were right next to my ear!!  Nice bedding is about the only plus I can say for this place.;2
It was nice enough and we got it for a good price.  As a nursing mother, they brought me a fridge quite quickly which was nice.  The food was good at both the bar and the restaurant.  We enjoyed our stay.;4
We stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton on a layover to Belize.  The hotel is conveniently located near LAX with free shuttle service to and from the hotel and airport.  That was about it on the positive side.  We were given a room in the east tower which was probably remodeled some time ago and not what you come to expect from a Sheraton hotel.  The room smelled of chlorine and was dirty.  Hair on the walls, beat up furniture and that chlorine smell was way too much.   Will definitely not be returning.;2
"The hotel is one of many close to LAX, but it is well located with respect to the car rental sites, especially Budget, and the staff is extremely helpful. I had an electronic key that refused to work and on returning to the desk, they immediately ""comped"" me with a full buffet breakfast for the next morning and an offer for a drink at the bar. My visit spanned two different days during the week and they were even more helpful on my return.  Try to stay in the East wing of the hotel, which seemed to be nicer than the West.";4
Close to the airport and most of the car rental return places. The rooms are big and the bathrooms are clean. There are two good restaurants. There is a really small shop down the street. There is a free shuttle that brings you to the airport.;4
"Very dated room. I felt as though I had entered a time machine taking me back to 1969. Obviously, that was either when it was built and/or last remodeled; complete with the sound absorbing acoustic popcorn on the ceilings. Frankly the only surprise was the TV didn't have rabbit ears (antenna). With that said, the bed was sleepable, and the bar was open. What more could I ask for from an older airport hotel.";3
I'm unfortunate enough to stay here about 10 times a year. Each time there is always a chaotic crowd around the front desk with only one or two guest service agents. The agents often become short and downright rude to the customers. I assume because of their workload.  The rooms are hit or miss. Mostly miss with cracked tile, mysterious stains in the baby room and beat up walls in desperate need of new paint. Do they bribe Starwood to keep their flag?;2
"My dgt and I were on vaca in California we are from Boston and on our last night we booked a hotel through trip advisor at the LA airport to catch a morning flight home. When we got to the hotel the hotel personal told us they had no room for us that trip advisor ""does this all the time"" ""over booking"". My dgt and tried to find another hotel with trip advisors help and unfortunately on a Saturday night in LA there are no rooms to be found! When I got home to Boston the next day and checked my bank account I found out that Trip Advisor took out the money so now it is 15 days later and 3 phone calls later I still have not been reimbursed my money! ""Sorry the ticket got closed by accident, we are reimbursing your acct now""...Oh yes and my dgt and I did find a room that night 21/2";1
This hotel was your average stop over hotel, for the price I paid, it was sadly overrated. If you are looking for frills and luxury, I would use another hotel, it is aging and could do with a refurb, pretty soon. The staff were pleasant enough, but getting booked in was a bit of a shambles, the queue for check-in, was extremely long, and they only had 2 receptionists on, so it took forever.;3
First let me say that this review would have been very different if I had not discovered the bar.  The hotel is very close to LAX (shuttle service) and convenient to get in and out of.  The parking is secure, but it does cost extra (they offer valet or self park, both with different fees).  The bed is consistent with the quality you expect from SPG.  Great mattress and pillows, very comfortable.  The room however was small, the window faced main entrance and would not close completely or seal so I had constant noise all night from people checking in and out, shuttle buses, people and cars.  The bathroom was small and below standard, in need of updating.  The late night check in process was slow, unfriendly and in general not very customer service focused.  If I am checking in;3
My husband and I had the greatest customer service experience. They gave us cookies galore and after a small misunderstanding we even got a voucher for milk to go with them. I am thrilled with their customer satisfaction and am looking forward to staying with them again.;5
My was was a good size room, the hotel is starting to show its age. My bed was comfortable. The best thing about this hotel my be the lounge and  restaurant good food and beer selection. There is a small coffee bar open in the mornings. Free airport shuttle.;4
Got stock in LA for a missed flight connection and had to overnight in the hotel. I got an Awful room with the window on a corridor, a nasty bathroom. Breakfast very poor (quality of food) despite expensive! I had a table with no chair. TV was very small and internet medium speed. Never again...;3
"I stayed here for the past two nights (november 2 & 3) & last night when I returned back to the hotel at at 2:45 am after having a show and being exhausted I was told that my room was changed. They said that I had a new room and proceeded to give me the key to it. Confused because I did not check out I asked how this could happen and where were both me and my friends belongings. They told us that they didn't know but it was probably in the new room. I said so someone just took my things out of my room and moved them to a new room? She said possibly. She also said that she could not let us into our ""old"" room bc it was now occupied by someone.   The lady named Helena had no compassion for what we were going through and the fact that she didn't seem to care was absurd. She made it";1
The hotel is quite strung out across its site and lacks a central reception, the reception is a small area tucked in one leg of the sprawling ground floor. At first I thought this was overpriced as some of the decor needs improving in the communal areas but actually the rooms were very nice, well appointed and comfortable so by the time I left I thought it was good value.  The airport is close but I cant stand paying for a room and then finding I have another $21 for parking overnight! My fault, should check before. Would not have stayed if I had known, its America, we have a car, we need to park it if we stay!!;3
The rooms are spacious and really comfortable, with really modern decoration. Wifi is free and really fast. The shuttle service to-from the airport is really efficient, and at check-in the employees at the desk are really helpful. I ordered room service a couple of times and the service was great, the food really good and delivered fast. I recommend this hotel.;4
Before I could get up to the door, someone was directing me anxiously to help me.  I was directed to the check in desk and my luggage was unloaded from the trunk and awaiting my check in.  The bellman was so friendly and full of delightful conversation.  Reminds me of the good old days when people were excited about what they did.  They delighted in making the guests feel like guest and not just a customer.  The stay was great.  Nice spacy room with awesome view of the airport.  Comfortable bed and good service.;5
I've stayed at a number of Sheratons and Four Points hotels as part of our SPG loyalty program. This is definitely the nicest Four Points by Sheraton I've stayed in. The lobby is beautiful, the staff greeted me at the front door and kindly again at the front desk.   The room is big and clean. Wifi is free with no password. They've clearly renovated recently because the decor and finishings are all modern, plus it looks like they're doing construction near the lobby (in an nonobstrusive way).  I would definitely stay here again. Way above average, especially for the price of $130!;5
Stayed for a stopover after a long flight. Free shuttle fine with very helpful driver both to the hotel and back again. Check in efficient. Room was spacious, clean and beds very comfy but there was a musty smell. Wifi worked perfectly but USB point which I needed to charge phone and iPad didn't. Pool area looked really nice and opens early but in the end I didn't get to try it.  A very long wait at the small cafe booth for a coffee in the morning. Only one staff member working there which is just not enough for the size of the hotel and hard on those of us really needing a coffee fix to get us going in the morning. Having said that, filter coffee was available in the main bar/restaurant area which was decently staffed on the previous night.  Overall fine for a budget stopover;3
I had stayed at this hotel several times about 10 years ago and always felt that it was a very good, upscale hotel that is close to LAX.  I haven't been at this hotel in a few years and my, what the years have done.  Very, very slow check-in at 8:00 PM on a Monday night.  I had made two reservations for this night (one for myself and one for a friend) and made a third reservation for my friend for a week from now. I have three confirmation emails all with the right guests but when I got here tonight I was told that there were FOUR reservations, all in my name.  So first I had to straighten that out.  Then as I got to my room I noticed that everything in the hotel is worn / dated.  They do give you a nice sized refrigerator and a decent coffee machine and lots of bottled water.;3
Average hotel with comfortable bedding and average room.  Shuttle to and from airport is a hot mess. Restaurant onsite was good and staff is friendly and accommodating. Okay to stay for business, they seem to always have some sort of meeting/event going on - plan on taking some time for check-in and be early for airport shuttle as it fills up;3
We stayed at this hotel for one night before we head off to the next destination. It was close to LAX and the staff were really friendly and excellent service. We even got help with suggestions for dinner around the area. The breakfast at the hotel was good with decent choices and variety.;4
Although the room we stayed in was a bit outdated and had ripped curtains, the bed was really comfortable and the room was spacious. We were disappointed that there wasn't a safe in the room. Wifi was reliable. We were really glad that we paid a small extra amount to have a late 8pm check out as we had a midnight flight and were able to have a shower before going to the airport for our 14 hour trip home.  The foyer and public areas downstairs and really nice and the bar was a pleasant way to spend a few hours relaxing after a big day. We ate in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner.  We didn't have the buffet.  Meals were nice but a bit expensive.   The hotel shuttle to the airport was really handy and arrived frequently.;4
I liked the entrance and lobby area. However the sleeping room needs a major update. The size of the bed room is very spacious but I did not like bathroom. The housekeeping forgot to clean the coffeemaker. I wish the side table by the beds would had outlets to charge a cellphone. But the staff were very friendly.;3
I booked this room to earn some SPG points while I visited some friend over the weekend in LA.   The hotel is very close to the airport and there are several free shuttles that go back and forth about every 15 minutes. I arrived late on Friday night but was able to get checked in quickly and was given a room at the end of the hall on the 4th floor.   The room: Nothing special but clean and large with a large window where you could watch planes landing at LAX. The blackout curtains worked very well and the hotel was quiet. The bathroom was a little tight but excellent water pressure. The bed was comfortable and I slept really well and I'm pretty picky about my beds.  Dining: I picked up lunch from the bar - Bangers and mash. Pretty tasty. I also had the breakfast buffet before my;4
Warm, welcoming staff and lovely rooms.  Spacious and well-appointed, nice bathrooms and good quality soap and amenities. The outdoor pool area looked nice but unfortunately didn't get a chance to try it.  The lobby Sports Bar was busy and a great meeting spot.   The coffee bar had a coffee machine grinding real coffee but sadly, only available for limited hours.  Would definitely stay again.;5
I have been staying here for 3 nights every other week for the last 15 months.  I'm fortunate that my status and the consideration of the front desk staff generally get me upgraded to a Junior Suite.  Even  the standard room have very comfortable beds, and good baths/showers.    The location is great, easy in and out. The hotel recently did a major renovation of their lobby and it looks great.  The bar at the hotel has a great menu and always interesting beers,    Any hitch that may come up with the room is promptly addressed.  One constant problem has been with the Internet. I thought it was to be updated, but nothing evident so far.     The upstairs  hallways and rooms are being refreshed and make a nice difference when completed.;4
The rooms looked to be in need of upgrading (including better soundproofing for the windows), but the staff was friendly and accommodating, the breakfast buffet was excellent, there was free wifi, and it's convenient to LAX (via shuttle).;3
We usually do not stay at airport hotels, but it was convenient for our short trip to LA. The biggest seller point was the proximity to Budget Rental care.   Most of the airport hotels charge for parking, and this hotel is right across the street from Budget.   We just needed a car for a day trip and it was convenient to not deal with parking costs and shuttling between the hotel and rental place.  We also pre-paid and received a good deal.    The shuttle from LAX was prompt, even though we had a delayed flight and didn't arrive until 2am.   The staff were all friendly.   The hotel is showing it's age and probably is due for an upgrade.   I would not recommend getting the 2 queen bed because the room is quite small and you can't control the temperature in the room.    Did not;3
I stayed for a night in August 2015. Martin at the front desk was very friendly, efficient and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. The staff we great. It's very convenient and the shuttle service to and from the airport made the whole journey very smooth and hassle free. I will use this on my next trip as well.;5
Stopped for one night before travelling on. Hotel was clean and basic. Noisy at night. Ok for a quick restbite for travelling on- not really suitable for a holiday destination.  Staff were friendly enough and the hotel Shuttle was a good added extra.;3
We had a nice stay at this hotel, it has been kept up very well.  Two exceptions were the windows are not double-paned and we could hear children in the pool outside at 8 in the morning from our second story room.  And the air conditioner was noisy and hard to program.  But the king-sized bed and pillows were perfect.  I appreciated the extra plugs for all our phones, etc, plus free wi-fi was nice.  We did not eat here outside of our event, and we appreciated the 12 noon checkout.;4
"When you book this place, AVOID the standard queen room. Make sure you're getting a DELUXE queen.  The standard queen rooms are terrible! The beds are most definitely NOT queen size, and they're even small for a ""hotel queen.""  These rooms do not have individual climate control, instead relying on a cooler/heater in the hallway to regulate temperature. This means, when you wake up in the morning, the rooms are nearly 80 degrees. When we asked the front desk why this was so, they told us they couldn't do anything about it. Apparently the deluxe queen rooms have their own climate control.  Overall, not the best experience traveling. I will avoid this place in the future.";2
I very rarely stay at airport hotels. On the whole I don’t like to feel isolated out by an airport. On a recent business trip I was criss-crossing the US several times and it became a necessity to use these hotels. The Four Points by Sheraton at LAX for me was just a place to sleep for a few hours between flying and getting to an appointment the next morning. The staff were well trained cheerful and very helpful. I did feel the rooms and the hotel in general were getting close to their “use by date” some screws missing on the control panel in the lift, a cracked tile in the bathroom. The room was perfectly comfortable and functional, but seemed just a little sad. Despite obviously being intended to service travellers at one of the world’s major international airports did not;3
I spent a one night on a lay over at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX and I was pleased with the SPG status recognition and the service I received upon check in. The staff went far and beyond to accommodate my requests and needs. Th restaurant service was average but the staff was friendly. Last but not least, the room was clean and well kept.;4
I booked the hotel for the location (near LAX airport) and because it was promoted as available for 24 hours from check in (if check in time advised 2 days prior). This was all a bit awkward. I arrived at the hotel about 7 pm and was hoping I could check out about 7pm the next night as I had a late night departure to Australia. Initially I was told that check out was at 2pm. After explaining my expectation I was offered 4pm check out. Whilst the staff were friendly and polite, they didn't seem to know about the '24 hour room' use promoted spefically for this hotel. Anyway I was eventually given to 6pm which I appreciated. As I checked out I was asked to pay a late check out fee! This was sorted promptly...but added to the bad taste theft with me.;4
"When my sister and i arrived at ""Four Points by Sheraton"" we not even had a reservation for a room and expected the worst! But Martin our receptionist was so helpful, nice and friendly. He was very active to give us a good room at one of the upper floors so that we could stay the night at the hotel near the airport. Thanks to him we had such a great stay and this made our last day in beautiful LA less sad!  5 points for Martin and the rest of the overwhelming friendly staff!!";4
"The room was a standard hotel room. Clean and comfortable beds. The only window actually faced the hallway, so we had almost no sunlight and the view was a wall. The water pipes was really noisy and woke me up a couple of times.  We didnt have a remote control for the TV, and only the first 9 or 10 channels actually worked. All the others just said ""no signal"".  Wifi was really bad, I could barely check my e-mail or social media. My sister didnt manage to get connected at all.   The breakfast was too expensive so we skipped it. Shuttle service was comfortable.  Overall an ok hotel but I would not stay again.";2
after a 15 day ride on route66 from chicago to LA, we stayed in the four points for one nigh. our room was clean and quiet. having window to the hallway were a bit strange. staff is friendly and helpful.;4
My partner and I spent one night here after our long flight from Germany. While this hotel wasnt horrible, it wasnt brilliant either. It was just average. I expected more from the hotel due to its Sheraton tag line and was disappointed with the price we paid for the room we received.  The room was clean and large, but very dark and damp smelling. It is very tired and reminisent of an old apartment block rather than a hotel.;3
I checked in here Friday for a conference. The lobby looks great and the front desk person was very friendly. We got given a room and after unpacking saw how there was black mold on the windowsill. We packed up and went to the front desk to ask for a new room since there was black mold by the window. The front desk person (a different person than who checked us in) gave no apology, said nothing, just gave us a different room (which he forgot to program in the room key, so had to make another trip to the lobby.  The second room was decent. There was peeling off of wall paper, and possible mold in the bathroom (discoloration on the ceiling above the shower).   For the price, not a good hotel to stay at. The lobby is beautiful, and the beds in the rooms were nice, but the rooms;2
On the postives for this place, the room was clean and the self parking was convenient and inexpensive with the package I had (some of the hotels in the Century Blvd corridor only offer valet).  But the hotel was below what I expected.  Other Four Points at which I have stayed were somewher between an Aloft and a Fairfield.  This was more like a Ramada unrenovated since 1983.  The room was dated and the lighting dim.  Carpet in the hallway was frayed.   The furniture in my room was scratched.  The bathroom pipes had visible rust.   For the money, you can do better in the LAX area.  I doubt that I will return;3
"We reserved a room which included free parking and free breakfast for two. We found the hotel to be a choice for an overnight stay in the LAX area.  Pros - Free shuttle from LAX - Friendly staff, quick check-in - Comfortable beds - Next to the Renaissance Hotel where the Sixt Rental car agency is located. We walked over to rent a car.  Cons - If breakfast is not included with your room it is expensive; same for parking.";4
The rooms were comfortable. The restaurants served a good variety of foods. The snack bar closed  sometime in the afternoon on the day we were there. I am not sure if that was a one off or a common practice.  It is a good place to stay close to the LA airport.;4
I booked a room and paid for 4 people, and only received one bed. I called the front desk and they told me that they were fully booked and could not accommodate me. I called the 1 800 number and they told me there was nothing they could do. I will never stay at this place again;1
Poor check in experience which took nearly 40 minutes (unable to locate booking from third party website), however they comped our parking as an apology, so that was at least a nice gesture.   Location is good for the night before or after a flight from LAX, and free airport shuttle is good. Hotel provides bag storage, and has an onsite bar/restaurant.   Rooms are adequate, but in need of an uplift. I would have been disappointed if we'd booked full rate, but at a significant discount, and for one night, we can overlook it.   Staff were pleasant, but being kept waiting for so long at check-in after a long day travelling was not a great experience.;4
This place is a odd and dirty.  The rooms are configured like an 80's motel and there is no consideration for SPG gold members that I could detect. I have never seen a sheraton like this.  The only redeeming feature is that the front desk staff are nice.;1
this is a great place to stay not far from airport or sightseeing , there is a tourist bus that stops by the hotel..for 5 dollars will take you to Manhatten Beach and two shopping centers also Teresa at the conciege desk will help you plan your sight seeing trips;5
Rooms are in horrible condition, wallpaper peeling, fixtures hanging off walls, filthy windows...I could go on forever.  It is unreal that Sheraton endorses this hotel.  Staff are pleasant but cannot help the absolute horrendous state of the rooms.  Don't be fooled by the lobby....the rooms are worse than student hostel.;1
Stayed here for a night, for we had an early flight the next day.  Location: Perhaps, this hotel serves patrons like us, who need a hotel close to the airport. Other than that it is very far from the city.  Room: Compact but felt a little small. We booked rooms with 2 double beds, which are a little small for 2 average size adults.  Service: What one can expect in any 4 start. Nothing to compliment nor complain about.  Food: The breakfast wasn't complimentary so couldn't comment on that.  Cons: The alarm clock was not working.   Overall: Book only if you have an early flight to catch. Else just cab it out from the city. Nothing to go gaga about. Only Plus is that it provides free airport shuttle.;3
If you are catching the hotel shuttle from LAX to hotel, pack a lunch!  I've stayed at this hotel 3x.  Every single time the shuttle is at minimum a 30 min - 1 hr wait.  Not to mention the steep steps you have to carry your luggage up to even find a seat on the van.  On my 4th stay, another person waiting for the bus as well suggested we take the Budget car rental shuttle and just walk across the street to the hotel.  So, that's what we did and it was smooth as can be.  When I go back, I will always catch the Budget bus & walk across the street.;2
Before I  into detail, please don't read any further, except do yourself the biggest favour and search for another hotel option.  This hotel is very poor.   How can there still be hotels like this in this day and age?  I chose this hotel of the Qantas frequent flyer hotel booking options as I was flying into LA from NYC arriving at 9.15pm and just wanted a hotel close to the car rental pick up location as I am driving out of LA the next morning.  The other reason I chose this hotel was for it's advertised airport shuttle service.   Every 20 minutes they say and yes I checked again on their literature in the room to verify this.  Well after waiting for 1 hour and 13 minutes the bus finally arrived.  My daughter actually timed the wait for some reason so I know that is accurate.;1
I love the way the Four Points has been refreshed.  The last time I was here was 3 years ago. I love the feel and especially the bathroom. It is simple but nice. I would definitely come back here again!;4
Hotel was OK for a short stay   but that is all you would want to use it for. The in house restaurant was very poor so of you stay there eat some where else,  rooms are also very tired looking. The price for parking also seams a bit over the top.;3
I had an awful experience at the Four Points by Sheraton. My daypack was stolen out of a restaurant close to the hotel lobby. Inside the pack were my my passport, iPod, iPad, hundreds of dollars in cash, some valuable jewelry and critically important medication. Security cameras around the restaurant would probably have contained footage of the the thief leaving the scene with my possessions. However, the hotel manager refused to look at footage of the security tapes, despite repeated requests to do so. In addition it took an outrageously long time for the hotel to arrange a taxi for me to go to a nearby police station to file a report. The hotel staff's attitude towards the theft was extremely inconsistent. Some staff members were sensitive to what I went through, others were;1
Sadly disappointed I'm surprised Sheridan has their name attached to this hotel. The rod we had were far below Best Western standards.  I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.  No ice bucket, no chair in the room at all, even though there is obviously a desk. The fixtures are falling apart, there is only one garbage can. It's very unwelcoming and smells like a musty beach cabin. For more than $130.00 a night. Extremely disappointing.;3
Would have given 5 stars only thing that lets it down is the windows stop no noise, at one time sounded like there was a man talking in my room, I was on the first floor above the lobby but it didn't stop me sleeping,  fortunately it is a quiet location. The room and hotel very clean, the bed was very comfortable had no trouble sleeping till 10 am, some signs of wear in hallways and bathroom but for the price it's not a biggy. They were a 1/3 of the price of the hotel 100feet away. The staff are all great and  very helpful. The food I had at 23:00 was nice a little pricey but it's a hotel they serve I think to 1 am, lots off beers over 100 to choose from. Very close to public transport which when you work it out is so cheap and reliable, Hollywood $9 return Santa Monica $2;4
I stayed here only for a couple hours in between flights and I would have thought the Sheraton would maintain the room but very unfortunate surprise.  Upon walking into the room and closing the door, the door would not close shut.  It took a couple of tugs on the door for it to finally close.  Inside the room was ok, but one of the lights did not work.  I went to the bathroom and that was where my high standard was shot down.  The toilet paper dispenser was not attached to the wall (drilled), it was instead lazily placed ontop of the toilet and one roll of toilet paper already unwound was standing next to it.  This was not a good experience at a hotel having the Sheraton name.  At ANY hotel one of the MOST important areas to maintain and keep in order is the bathroom, so when I;2
The convenience to the airport and car rentals is great.The view from our room this time was toward the airport and we watched the planes coming in just above the other buildings, Very cool! The hotel rooms could use an upgrade.They are well taken care of and clean.Just a bit worn. The staff is top notch. Had a problem(unwanted wakeup call)and the staff was more than helpful. Stayed there twice in the last six months while bringing our son to college and would reccomend this hotel. There are other hotels in the area with a better price,but this is a Sheraton and the price fits the hotel.;4
Significantly improved wifi speed since previous stays. Rooms have been updated. Very frequent shuttle service 24h/day. Windows can be opened for outside air, this is becoming hard to find. Refrigerators are standard in rooms for gold level members of their rewards program.;4
Good for an overnight stay  between flights. Shuttle from the airport to the hotel. The room was spacious but a little tired, some lights did not work. Free wifi. Although close to the airport you do not hear any noise. Good sleep quality.;3
After a 13hr flight and landing at 7am in the morning, it was great to be able to check in and catch a few hours sleep.  Room was big enough and quiet and the staff were most helpful with our requests.;4
I stopped off here for one night in between flights and I was happy with the room, the bed was comfortable and room service delivered a lovely meal. No fridge in the room but that was the only thing missing. I used the gym, it was very average but what you would expect for the price of the hotel.;4
I thought I would stay at a hotel near the airport after a few days in downtown LA and Anaheim. Should have stayed another night in Anaheim. On arrival - didnt have my room ready - 6pm so not outside of expected check in time. Beacuse they couldnt kick out the guy in my 7th floor room (SPG perks) then they moved me down two floors. Was very clear I needed a quiet room. The staff person apologized for the confusion and offered a breakfast buffet (which was good= by the way). Nice. However - my room was very noisy and i finally checked the reason why. The sliding single pane windows didnt close all the way and someone had used black electrical tape to try and keep it closed. When I called the night manager he offered to give me a different room but I would need to pack up - return;2
During my many visits to the Sheraton four points Los Angeles Airport each time I've always received 7 star service from check in to room service to housekeeping and the restaurant I must say that I am treated like I'm part of the family of the Sheraton four points hotel and valet parking they are so helpful also I just want to say thank you to each one of the staff members of this location other hotels can I even come close to the seventh star service my hotel choice to stay is the Sheraton four points whenever I'm in the Los Angeles area thank you again for the great and excellent customer service sincerely , Mr .J Johnson;5
DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  I stayed here in November 2014. This review has taken quite a while to post, because I have given the hotel ample time to address the situation. Unfortunately, they have not helped at all. My recommendation is not to stay here, unless you like having your personal items stolen by dishonest staff.  I left a bag with the Bell Desk whilst I was on a two week tour around south west USA. For this privilege, I paid the hotel $3 per day. In the bag were gifts and personal items that I had purchased whilst in LA. The bag was locked with a TSA padlock. The staff member at the bell desk was surly, unhappy and generally unhelpful.  Upon return to LA, I checked into the hotel and collected my bag. I didn't need any of the items in the bag, so I didn't open it. My;1
Whenever we travel out of LAX Airport we overnight at the Four Points Sheraton.  The rate of the rooms is very reasonable, the hotel is clean and they have free wifi.  It just works for us.  No fuss, no muss.;3
The rooms are clean. very basic but suitable for a night's lay over between flights. Comfy beds but no bar fridge in our room. Free wifi!  Early 24hour check in available if you pay over $189 for room. Was worth it if u land at 6am! We checked in at 7am and have 24hours to checl out.  Staff are friendly and helpful.   Free airport shuttle from LAX to hotel was handy.  Breakfast wasn't very good.  Bus stop (the big blue bus ) across the road (outside burger king) will take you directly to Santa Monica for $1, a nice day trip to the famous pier, beach or shopping if you have a few hours to kill. It's About 45min bus ride there. Same bus brings you back. Bus No.3.   Overall not bad for a night's stay. Didn't get a chance to explore hotel pool but seems okay.;4
This is a great hotel  for the price. Clean very friendly. Quick easy check in . Couldn't get a taxi to go shops so one of the staff offered me a lift I was very surprised. Great employee .  Was also offered free ribs and salad out by pool with a beer. Also very good. Will stay again  beds very comfy  well done;4
We managed to find a room for USD$84 using Booking.com and it was worth it.  They have free and open wifi which is amazing for a hotel.  The room was clean and basic.  Only downside is the noise. You can hear other guests walking up and down the corridor and using the ice machine.   Free shuttle to LAX.  Oh and they need more staff at check in. The queue time was pretty bad.;4
6th Floor, Junior Suite  This hotel was needed for a quick place to rest during our 12 hour layover at LAX. We got in late, they seemed confused by our late arrival even though we called and let them know we were going to be late due to our flight.  They gave us a room, we went to it, it had not been cleaned from the previous person. We called them, they put us in a Junior Suite on the 6th floor.   Pros - The bathroom was really nice - it looked like it had recently been remodeled - The restaurant was open until 12:45a to accommodate late arrivals - We called to request a room service menu (that was missing from our room) and 2 extra bottles of water. They sent it right up, no charge, it was great since we had come off of a long day of travel and ran out of water. - Convenient;3
"Stayed on night as I arrived at LAX in the evening and was flying out the next morning. First impression was good is the lobby has obviously recently been refurbished and looks contemporary and new. The room was huge, but looks like it hasn’t been touched since the eighties (except for a relatively new TV set. Unsurprisingly airplanes are flying quite close to the hotel, so I would usually expect an airport hotel to have good acoustic insulation; unfortunately this is not the case here so it is quite noisy. Breakfast was ok.";2
Stayed for 1 night. Everything excellent and comfy. Breakfast was very good, but a little pricey. Great service all around and everyone nice and helpful. . Great wifi and Cable. Lots of amenities in bathroom. Will stay again;5
Everything had gone off the rails -- the people I was going to stay with had sudden difficulties that made it impossible, there were no cars available from any rental agency, and my computer wasn't getting along with the network.  I wasn't going to stay at this hotel, I had just intended to hit their bar for a while, but after talking to Lupe at the desk, who took my agitated state in stride and was a lot nicer to me than I probably deserved, I decided I could do a whole lot worse.  The next day, Lupe wasn't there, but Trish was equally wonderful at treating me like a human being, not just an entry in the register.  The whole staff was great, at least the ones I had anything to do with -- Lupe, Trish, Conor in the bar, Luis in the restaurant, and Eddie in engineering.  They had;4
I stayed at the hotel basically to sleep between my flight the next day. I arrived around 7 pm and there shuttle picked me up at the airport. There are a few fast food near the hotel.  The room was well appointed and updated and modern. The room I was in was near an elevator that I did hear off and on throughout the night. I am a light sleeper so not everyone might not notice. The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows and the air worked well. I left very early for a flight and the shuttle took me back to the airport. No appointment is necessary as it runs every twenty minutes. When in LA I will stay at the Sheraton again.;5
Lovely lounge area, very good food at the restaurant, but best of all, the Manager Mahood's kindness diffused a very stressful time for us and absolutely made our day! It's a great hotel, very close to the airport with free shuttles every 15 minutes to and from airport.  Room was clean and very comfortable. All the staff were lovely.;4
After being on the back of a motorcycle,  for 3 weeks, riding cross country,  it was such a surprise that Juan, the front desk receptionist, remembered who I was and greeted me with a genuine smile. He also said, I haven't seen you for a while and welcome back. That to me, makes me feel special!  Between the Sheraton 4 points LAX, and The Westin LAX, these are my top 2 Favorite hotels!! Both clean, safe, and consistent.;5
I checked into tis hotel around 1am the 26th of August and had the worst experience ever. I was placed in a out of service room along with my service animal, after I called front desk twice about the a/c not working and the bathroom light not shutting off, I received a call from maintenance almost 1 1/2 hrs later and was told by the guy he will be right up.  well he never came so I finally fell sleep but was unable to sleep comfortable because I was wet with sweat and the light from the bathroom was shinning in my face. So shortly before 5am I realize that know one was coming to correct this problem, I then came down to front desk to be told it was nothing they can do other than send maintenance, I ask to speak with the manager and was told, none was on duty and that they will;1
We chose this hotel because of its closeness to the rental car return points - only about 500 yards from Avis! We checked in about 5.00pm and were given our room key by friendly and efficient reception staff. Room was great with all the usual smellies! Lobby area was large with plenty of seating. The adjacent bar was spacious with a big TV screen showing the obligatory ball game! There was also a small counter serving hot drinks and pastries. Car park was $12 which was maybe a bit spiteful, but, hey, it was our last night! Overall a pleasant place to stay with its proximity to the airport and car rental returns an added bonus.;4
Loved the service at this Four Points. Everyone was helpful! My only complaint is the rooms were a bit small. The restaurant had great food, a bit pricey but overall I had a wonderful stay. I would definitely book again when I come down in December.;4
We stayed 2 nites before a motorcycle tour of the USA. Nice spacious quiet room, with good sized bathroom. Bar/Restaurant in lobby serves cols beer and nice pizzas.  Very convenient location to airport, beaches and downtown;4
Yesterday we spent 57 minutes curbside waiting for a van to the hotel only to have the van close the door in our face because we were angry about waiting so long and asking why it took so long. At the time we did not know the hotel had nothing to do with the van. LAX handles the van. The TV didn't work properly and the water smelled. There is no air conditioning control in the room an it was a bit warm. Marcell at the hostess stand was the bright spot of the stay. She was wonderful.;3
Of course we cannot expect much at a large airport hotel, but it was a dreary end to our stay in California. Room was large and comfortable, so we got a good nights sleep, but that was the only real plus point. Eating options were limited to an expensive fine-dining Italian restaurant or an extremely noisy bar. Shuttle bus seemed unreliable.  Coming from the terminal to the hotel, we had to wait 20 minutes, and when it did arrive, of course not everyone could get on!;2
I really had high hopes from the room but the rooms provided were nowhere near the same. Firstly, I did not expect large rooms but still the room area was really cramped up for 2 Queen beds per room. Only good thing was that we booked two rooms and they provided us both rooms side-by-side with connecting doors. One more downside was that after every bath the water in the bathtub used to drain out very slowly. Not sure if there was some drainage issues. They did offer to have the same repaired but it was already 11:00 PM so we had to go to sleep. Simply not worth it...;2
Yes I have to agree with previous reviewer.  Busy airport hotel. Room had window to corridor but was reasonably spacious and quiet.   The Reception and check in was poor  - hard to find it even.  Not clear about parking.  Ate at the restaurant which was not good value.  Nothing much close by.;3
We chose this hotel on a package deal that includes parking and staying the night before our flight because we had an early morning flight and wanted to be near the airport. The staff was helpful and friendly. We were able to park our car in sight right below our hotel window. The hotel restaurant had delicious quality food, though a bit pricey. Room was nice with comfortable bed. The shuttle in the morning was free and tool is to our airline at lax in a timely fashion. They also picked us up after the trip and brought us back to the hotel to get our car. A pleasant experience. The only bad thing is that you are quite close to the airport and you do hear the planes pretty loudly from the room all night long. They had a small pool area that looked nice though we did not have time;4
The room smelled funky and was in the center wing of the hotel.  It was more of a motel style room with a window out into the hallway.  This window made for a very noisey room.  The tv was broken and it took about an hour to get a new room.  Eddie tried getting me and upgrade but my guess is the manager did not find it necessary.  Faucet pretty much disconnected from wall.  Just a little pricey for an outdated hotel that could use some improvements.;2
Convenient to airport, it is a little like a people factory, but staff hospitable.  Room comfortable, air cond did not seem too work.  Breakfast good, shuttle bus welcome and efficient, would stay again.;5
We spent a night here after a full day of travelling. The front desk service was superb and very apologetic when I had to return to them with a dysfunctional room key.   Room was great. Good size and clean.   The next morning we got to experience the pool and fitness facility, both of which were fantastic. We also had breakfast at the hotel and, although a bit pricey, it was truly delicious. This hotel was much better than the one we stayed at downtown LA.;4
"A last minute trip to Los Angeles brought me to the Four Points.  Never stayed in one and truly because of the hasty plans, price was the winning factor.  We generally go to a Westin or Sheraton property.  However, what make this stay memorable is the amazing staff.  Every single employee I saw or even passed in the hall, offered a warm greeting.  From the front doorman to registration to the housekeeper, these folks conveyed a sincere hello.  Not the tired ""I'm bored and I'm only doing this because I have to...""  The Four Points by Sheraton staff delivered the message that said, ""We appreciate your business!""  Every hotel has beds, showers, amenities, etc., etc., etc.,  All any innkeeper has to sell is service - and these people are service experts!";4
Stayed in this hotel several times rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. The Staff were very helpful there are washing Machines and you can buy the soap powder from reception. The Bar downstairs is good and so is the food from there you can go across the road to the several fast food places to eat which are cheaper but not as good. For an airport hotel its pretty good and generally good value;4
good value for money, 3 star hotel VERY connected to LAX.  on facilities side, it would rank bit low compared to what you would expect from an airport business hotel, but considering pricing is very competitive i would say ok to compromise on that  chosing this hotel is obviously just a matter of convenience being close to the airport. don't expect anything extraordinary, but in the price range its ok.;4
As I have moved to Boston, I have to come back and see my West Coast Family and when i do I try and book the Four Points by Sheraton at LAX.  It's close, convenient, the staff is so friendly and helpful especially Martin at the front desk. He remembered me from my stay in JANUARY! He upgraded me to a direct LAX view so I could watch the planes land. Yeah, I'm a plane geek so my 3rd floor room was PERFECT!  I had a small issue with the desk chair in the room and the maid Marvella(sp?) was right on it and replaced it in a SNAP! I love this hotel because of its value, location, staff, and sincere hospitality. It's close to the 405 and La Cienega so you can get to where you're needing to go easily. LA Traffic? That's another story! lol. Jorge, my server in the restaurant COMFORT was;4
"In short, I needed a hotel in LA last minute and had some budgetary constraints to deal with along with my timeframe. With that being said I wound up at the Sheraton Four Points by LA and was quite surprised with everything. The room was very inexpensive and despite the last minute booking I was given my preference (high floor away from the elevator). The rooms were extremely clean. The staff (check in, check out, room service & coffee bar) were extremely courteous and very helpful. The location got me to both downtown LA and Santa Monica very quickly (as quickly as one can get around in LA) and the best thing was; NOT ONCE did I hear any of the air traffic despite being less than a mile from the runway at one of the nation's busiest airports. I would definitely stay here again.";4
I have stayed at most LAX hotels in this price range. There are many better options.  The positives: The staff were generally good, with Monica at reception and Farouk at the concierge desk outstanding. My bed and pillows were very comfortable.  The negatives: The hotel is badly in need of an update. Walking down the hallway to my room, I noted minor carpet stains and doors chipped and aged. I thought I was in a  2-3 star hotel. My room had wallpaper from the 1980s and rusted metal fittings (e.g. sprinklers). My room's one window opened onto a hallway and the curtains and shade did not adequately keep light out in the morning,  This hotel is literally surrounded by better options (e.g. Renaissance, Hilton) that are similarly priced.  Choose one of them.;2
I am guessing we got an un-refurbished room which looked like something from 1980.   It was however clean and comfortable if old and ok for the price.  The airport shuttle was convenient and only 10 minutes ride so really good for getting in late, leaving early.  The hotel is also close to takeaways and restaurants, 5 minutes walk to a Denny's.  We did have room service breakfast at the hotel and it was the worst breakfast we had ever eaten so avoid at all costs!;3
"We booked this expecting easy access to LAX and it worked out great. We checked in late; slept a few hours; grabbed breakfast and used the hotel shuttle (that they share with other hotels nearby)  to catch an early flight.  Lots of respect at this hotel for Gold Starwood members and we appreciate that.   We stayed at 3 Sheraton properties on this trip and this hotel won hands down for the friendliest staff.  Everyone was helpful and happy.  No big LA attitude at all and we loved that. I would guess we had encounters with 10 employees and each was very professional and very good.  (John had the front desk was awesome.)  By the way---they have good bellmen (unlike our last Sheraton where we never saw one and we were there 5 nights and they had over 400 rooms.) Room had lots of";5
Bed was perfect, including the pillows.  The room and bath were always sparkling clean.  Air conditioning simple to set, black out drapes did a great job.  Plenty of space to store luggage and settle in. The pool area provides a beautiful place to relax.  But, by far the biggest asset at this hotel is the staff.  I give the Concierge, Front Desk, bar staff, restaurant staff and Housekeeping staff FIVE stars. My stay was quiet and  comfortable....I could not have been more pleased.;5
This is an airport hotel, so if you are just looking for somewhere to rest your head for one night it might be OK.  We booked in for 2 nights and were very disappointed.  The reception and communal areas are fine, and the staff were quite helpful, but the rooms really are terrible.  They have those old, noisy air conditioning units underneath the windows which I remember (not very fondly) from my childhood.  I didn´t even know they still made them!  It was hard to sleep with it switched on due to the noise but it was hot in the hotel so we had no alternative.  It also leaked everywhere so by the end of the second night there was water covering a third of the room.  The staff didn´t seem surprised when I mentioned it at check-out.    Again, I realise this is not sold as a high;2
I was looking for an airport close to the airport as I had an early flight out. There are lots of hotels close by but this is one block away from Avis so you can return your car rental and walk back to the hotel. This is good as every hotel charges for parking. They have shuttles that will get you to the airport. The ate at the bar while waiting for my food and my salad and steak fries were great. Lots of people trying to check in at one time and the Director of Operations started handing out cookies and summoned extra staff to get to  everyone registered. This gentleman was Mohammed Abouelrous. He was even helping in the Bar to make sure everyone was served and got their food on time. Every hotel needs someone like Mohammed. There was one big downside to this hotel. This is a;4
Stayed here for 1 night prior to an International flight.  The room was quite big and spotlessly clean. Beds are comfortable.  Had everything your need.  They have a shuttle that takes you to and from the airport which is an excellent service.  Staff are helpful and really nice, made for a great stay.  Close to food outlets in other hotels and also close to the airport.;5
"It had been a VERY long day and I made it to the hotel close to 10 PM (and would be leaving at 4 PM).  The driving, the traffic (it is Los Angeles after all).  And when I got to the front desk, John recognized my SPG status, asked if there was anything he could to do make my short visit more comfortable, and when I asked him to direct me to where I could but a Diet Coke, he said, ""Let me get one for you.""  Really?  What a simple but extremely thoughtful gesture that the hotel allows him to provide on behalf of guests.  This really is the hospitality business after all, and so few hotels are genuinely hospitable.  John made the difference for me.  I was impressed and that act alone will ensure that my next LAX stay will be at this hotel.  There are numerous other reasons (besides";4
The room was great and the location was perfect for airport, Coliseum, and access to shuttle that drops off at mall and beach.  Check-in was lengthy and the price for parking was ridiculous especially since you have to pay valet or self-park. The rooms were expensive enough to include parking .;4
Needed an Airport Hotel near the Budget Airport Hotel & this really fits - it is just across the road.  It is a typical Airport Hotel, rooms pretty basic but all you need - beds were really comfy.  Staff were great - nothing was a problem.  The restaurant could look at a bit more excitement in their menu - pretty basic!!;3
Had an overnight stay here enroute to Las Vegas. Greeted warmly and offered free breakfast as our room was not ready (we arrived at 8.30am) Instead we settled in by the pool and enjoyed the sunshine and swimming. Pool towels always available and plenty of lounges and shade. Room was large clean and very comfortable. Our friends from N Z arrived 4 hrs late but were similarly welcomed and we all enjoyed a lovely variety of filling snacks with some drinks in the bar that night before enjoying a substantial breakfast from the buffet next morning before our departure. All round excellent service and friendly helpful staff.;5
I visited this nice hotel twice last month.  It's convenient to airport and perfect for quick visits. Staff is friendly.    Recommended place for business trips.  I plan on visiting again in the future simply because of its location.;4
After experiencing a horrific hotel in West Hollywood, this hotel was absolutely perfect. The shuttle to and from the airport was a breeze to find and the staff were excellent and super friendly, which was appreciated after a delayed and extremely annoying flight from SFO to LAX. The room service food was incredible, probably the best food I had my entire trip.  Would definitely go again.;5
I've stayed at every LAX hotel over the years and the Sheraton Four Points is the worst if you want to actually sleep.  Why is that?  Because it's super noisy!  Like others have written this hotel feels like a cheap motel and you'll get that kind of sleep too.  Paper thin walls and windows that let in a lot of noise.  But the worst thing is that they engineered the doors to always SLAM shut every time someone goes in or out of the room so you feel the vibration too and not just the noise.  Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else so you'll at least be able to sleep.;1
Really good price for one night very closer to the airport and I like take some tours befor comeback to the reality, the room it's fantastic, the breakfast was great and the shuttle was always at time;4
Out of all hotels close to LAX i have chosen this place not knowing what to expect, aside from it's really close to the airport. Well, check-in was quick with a friendly front desk guy. Our room was good enough for a night stay..we had our dinner located at the lobby. Food was yummy for a good price..Before we call it a night to rest, we prepared our breakfast order and hanged the menu by our room door  and requested to be delivered at 6:15am but was not picked up before midnight, so we ended up going down to the hotels' restaurant to re-order..but it was a real amazing surprise that the hotel did not charge us for our breakfast because our order was not picked-up... 'Twas a fast check out too and the LAX shuttle service was fast and comfortable..Yes, i highly recommend this;4
"A great hotel to roll into straight after a 14 hour flight! The 24hr check in check out is the perfect idea, and so incredibly convenient to have a shower and a quick nap after a long flight. Plus the bed and pillows feel like a little bit of heaven after flying. The bar is great, epic range of beers and the BBQ wings are delish. All the staff are super friendly and helpful; and the gym is pretty well equipped. All in all a great hotel. Looking forward to my next stay at the end of the month :)";4
After several trips to Los Angeles, I have decided that this is my hotel to stay at when I fly out of LAX in the early morning hours.  The hotel is very quiet- the rooms are very spacious.  The staff is very friendly.  The shuttle service runs 24 hours and is always on time.  The only downside is that the food is a bit limited, other than in the hotel, unless you want to go to Burger King.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  You may every once and a while hear a plane overhead but none woke me up in the middle of the night.  I also like staying here and then dumping my rental car (Budget and Hertz are right next door, so you can drop the luggage, ditch the car a day early, and take the shuttle to LAX),;4
The hotel has been renovated and looks great.  Staff was friendly,  room was very clean, and the little details made it pleasant.  The landing path was nearby where we could see them land but the noise was minimal.  We only stayed a night but would have been happy to have stayed longer.;5
"I am not a frequent guest at the Starwood properties. But we needed someplace close to the airport.  All my usual choices were booked up, or priced out of sight.  We actually wound up here using Hot Wire.  Very Convenient location,  Lobby and restaurants very nice.  As others mentioned, the airport shuttle is a big plus.  This is what Hot Wire calls a ""boutique"" hotel.  That means a bit older, perhaps not updated as recently. The rooms had some age, but were nevertheless clean and the bed quite comfortable.  The first pair of rooms had a problem with one of the air conditioners.  When I had checked in, Mohammed the Director of Operations introduced himself and promised to take care of anything I needed, 24/7.  I took him up on that and called about the air conditioner. He had";4
A great room, with great facilities. Everything was very clean, and there was hot water in the shower. The air conditioning wasn’t simple to use and stayed at the same temperature even when I changed it. I didn’t order breakfast, as I thought it was expensive. The internet was OK. The gym facilities were great. The shuttle came every 30 minutes, and the location is close to the airport. Not many food facilities around the airport though. A good place to stay for a night.;3
Very convenient for LAX with free shuttle service running every 20 to 30 minutes. Staff fantastic, couldn't do more to help if they tried. Restaurant food excellent particularly reasonable priced breakfasts. Adequate gym with everything you would expect. Some parts of the hotel are a little tired, like the lifts and corridors but neither if these affected my stay. Clean room, comfortable bed and lovely crisp, clean linen and towels.;5
Me and My son had a flight delay in LA we were having a hard time finding a room due to the Special Olympics  when I call ELLENA at the Four points Sheraton. this lady was amazing she went out of her way for us. this is  hopefully the worst thing that  happens to us on our trip of a live time to Australia. Thanks aging to Four Points LA and ELLENA for all your help. Tom & Jason Allen;5
My family and I decided to spend a couple of days in the LA area before heading out to Oahu. The staff was courteous, the restaurant area clean, but we did notice the the area above the first floor was a bit dated. We did have an incident where a front clerk tried to help us check into our airline because we couldn't do so on their computer set up for such tasks. When the clerk let my wife use his computer in order to check in immediately some person in funky shorts and muscle t-shirt came up to the clerk and asked him to go to his office.  A short time later we found out that the clerk had been written up for helping us. We, at this point were baffled and practically embarrassed that this had occurred.  So, not saying it's a bad place to stay just that it appears that security;3
A quick ride on the free shuttle bus from the airport, check in was quick and easy. The lobby and restaurant are bright and clean. Ample lifts to the different levels. Our rooms were large with two very comfortable queen beds, lovely soft pillows, good linens. TV, large desk, lots of plug sockets, clock, coffee machine. Separate bath/shower and toilet, very small but adequate. Open sink area with wardrobe, hairdryer, iron and board. Complimentary toiletries and plenty of towels. Breakfast in the restaurant was good but. not a huge variety on offer. There was a chef cooking up fresh eggs and pancakes on one morning, apparently you could request these if he wasn't there.  We had a snack one evening, which was ok, a little overpriced as per usual in airport hotels     We didn't;4
We had an early flight Monday morning so we stayed here for convenience. We headed down to the hotel bar for some drinks before bed and I don't understand how that man has that job. He is unfriendly and plainly not good. I understand that this is a hotel and not a bar but people want to come downstairs and enjoy a drink without having to work to get it. As I was only here one night I didn't experience many of the staff but if he is representative of it then I wouldn't stay here again.;3
We check in for 1 night after a long flight as we arrive from lax on a free shuttle we check in and the young lady that help us was very kind and friendly, check in was fast and very easy we walk in to our room and had a pleasant surprise that our rooms was very clean spacious and comfortable. They also send us a little welcome gift that was an amazing gesture from the front desk.;3
Let me start off by saying that the staff is very friendly and helpful, but this hotel is in desperate need renovation.  While the lobby is tastefully appointed, the rooms are drab, word, and the beds are not worthy of a Sheraton.. The cooling system in my room did not work properly and the hot water went out during the night, so I and my colleagues were greeted with cold showers the next morning. Also  my towel, which I had hung up for reuse  was removed by housekeeping despite the severe drought in California. While I have experienced below par Four Point hotels in the past, Sheraton has been doing a good job of upgrading this chain. All that I can suggest is this Four Point be moved to the top of the list for renovation.;2
I couldn't belive the state of my room. I have stayed in nicer motels! The carpet was stained, the furniture is old and falling apart. Uncomfortable and small. The wallpaper was pelling off and the walls were dirty! The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the bed was comfortable but the pillow had no pillow cover and there was hair on the pillow.  Small tv and crappy coffee. The  room smelled too!. I couldn't believe this was Sheraton brand hotel! I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all even if it's a quick overnight to catch the plane.;1
It's a stopover hotel for a lot of people (very close to LAX) but I've spent over 80 nights in this hotel... I used to work down the street.    Nemo... in the bar... is wonderful.  They have dozens of beers to choose from, some good wines, and a surprisingly good menu.    The hallways are tired, and the rooms are a bit, too, but the beds and bedding are first rate.   The staff is exceptional.  Be prepared, if you get there with a large group (flight crews frequent the hotel) you might wait a bit to check in...   Great wifi.  Great pool.  Free shuttle to LAX.;4
Currently under refurbishment but closest hotel to airport with continuous free shuttle.  Five of us including 2 year old twins landed after flight cancellations, missing baggage for all of us and a 3 hour time difference (10pm at departure 7pm in LA).  Shuttle wait a couple of minutes and it did go to a car park before the hotel but great service from driver and then again on arrival.  Bit of a roundabout walk to lifts but easy to find.  Well equipped almost empty gym good pool and seating and reasonably priced breakfast.  Easy walking distance back to airport to relocate missing baggage.  Would definitely stay here again.;4
Employees were all awesome, kind and friendly. Comfortable bed and pillows.  Why is the use of a microwave so far and hidden?. Very central close to airport and right across from Budget rent a car. Hotel parking cost is ridiculous!;4
The Four Points is 5 minutes driving from LAX and has a free 24 hour shuttle service to all the terminals of LAX. Better use it - I chose to pick up people from LAX using my rental car and got a big fine for stopping in the bus zone. The hotel is also very close to rental car companies- literally opposite Budget for instance.  Was thanks to SPG status upgraded to a junior suite, this was a really nice room with a sofa pull out bed in addition to the comfy king bed. The Brewster's bar was really nice although the 10 beers on tap did not work due to refrigerator problems. The pool was good, too.;5
My boyfriend & I had been in Los Angeles for 3 weeks when I had to have emergency surgery. My travel insurance placed us in this hotel after I was discharged from hospital where we stayed here from the 6th -12th if Juky. Amazing hotel, food is overpriced and the wifi was a nuisance.  But overall we had a great stay and Jose and another colleague (forgot his name, but it began with E) was amazing. I'll definitely stay again, hopefully the wifi is better and the food prices become more cheaper.;4
Wonderful hotel to use if flying in or out of LAX. Free shuttle the hotel from airport is very easy to use.  Hotel rooms are wonderful and clean.  Workout facility is open 24 hours and is one of the better hotel gyms I've found.  Breakfast buffet is okay but seems over priced.   I will stay here again.;4
Very close to airport.  Nice size room. Mine had a king size bed with 4 pillows. Very comfortable.  Decent bathroom. Nice flat screen television.  View of the pool. Nice oversized desk that doubles as a dresser in a weird sort of way. Pull out boxes for your clothes.  Coffee maker. Nice lounge chair with ottoman. Closet with lots of hangers and my favorite part, a iron and ironing board. Also had hair dryer and plenty of towels. Staff is very nice. Full Bar on site (didnt try it). Lots of conference rooms in hotel. A little gift shop that is outrageous with their prices.  It was a nice 1 night stay. The window I had looked like it would just fall any second.  I could hear conversations at the pool area..uhg! Ive stayed in much worst and ive stayed in better. This is a bit above;3
This LAX hotel costs 7,000 points per night, and I would say it is totally not worth it based on my 2 night stay. The room looks very old, and it's more like I'm in a motel than in a Four Points. Be aware that you might not sleep well. Although I did not hear any noises of the planes or whatsoever, the ice machine on the corridor is noisy, and wall is thin. It might be that I'm not lucky enough get a room in the newer parts of this hotel, but I would probably not return to this property.;2
This moderately priced hotel features a reliable 24 hour shuttle every 15 minutes to and from LAX.  The rooms are comfortable and quiet.  We had a late dinner and drinks at the bar which suited us.  Good place for one night on our way out of Los Angeles.;3
Had an early flight out of LAX so stayed here because it is right across the street from Budget where we had rented our car. Arrived very late - still a line to check in but it went quickly. Parking was scarce but did find a spot after driving around a few times. The room was clean nothing fancy - it is an airport hotel - but the bathroom had no soap in the dispenser so we had to use shampoo in its place and the towels were so tiny and thin you could practically see through them!  Because of its convenient location to LAX and Budget Rent-a-Car we would maybe stay here again but certainly not because we loved th hotel. Too pricey for what it is.;2
Was booked in for 2 nights but ended up staying for 4 nights after I was refused to fly home from being sick. When we tried to check in 1 hr early they said we had to wait even tho I was so sick. I was quite disappointed as I did see others checking in early. The room was a good size with comfy beds and pillows. Bathrooms are small. The room does look a bit dated and tired for the money you pay. I did enjoy sitting at the window and watching the flights coming into LAX while I rested to get better. Breakfast was good and one of the men would have my juice ready for me when I'd arrive. I had the freshly made Omelet and it was just yummy. I felt the difference in price for the hotel from our first booking to the extra nights was a bit expensive but being sick we didn't have much;4
The hotel is located conveniently near LAX. They have an airport shuttle. The rooms are alright. The receptionist was nice. However on 2 of the 3 nights that we were here, someone knocked on our door and tried to open it in the middle of the night. Also one night the hotel staff called us at midnight, to just ask some questions like our name and stuff, I was half asleep during that call. I have no idea why they called and why this couldn't wait until morning. We did not have the time to complain, hence this review. Also the wifi sucks.;3
"We stayed in this hotel earlier in 2015 and it was much better then.  We like to be closer to the airport the night before early trips back east, and this time we decided to spend an extra day in the LA area to do some touristy sightseeing....  We arrived and were told our rooms were ready - and that our request to have adjoining or adjacent rooms had been accommodated!  I went to tell my friend which end of the hotel we would be staying on so he could pull the car up on that end to unload.  I got back to the desk only to find that ""oops"" we were moved to the other end!  Ok no problem - I asked for a bellman and got some help for the trek with all of our luggage.  I noted that the room key numbers were not consecutive and wondered how they could be adjoining or adjacent.";2
Stayed here for one night. Had to wait a little while to check in (too few hotel staff available at the time). Priority seems to be given to people in airline costumes. At the time we checked in they just sort of cut in front and the hotel staff just served them obsequiously, rather than politely asking them to wait their turn. We asked for a quiet room away from loud areas but were given a room close to elevators. It also had one interconnecting door. The doors slam by themselves – not good when people are catching flights at 4am. There is handy 30-minute free parking.;3
Excellent front desk reception staff,especially John and Charles.my wife and I spent 3 days at Hotel and we able to closely observe the wonderful people skills of man by name of Charles. Good size room and able to open window a little to let in fresh air.  Room needs a safe and English breakfast tea that was as scarce as hen teeth. Quiet room,good housekeeping and hotel close to bus stops.;4
If you just need a place to stay near LAX and are in need of that extra night/stay to meet that next SPG tier, then by all means stay here.  It's a pretty well used Four Points and needs a good cleaning and updating.  If you know what to expect then you will have no complaints...just don't expect much.  Every room seems to be loud as heck with the airplanes...louder than most of the other LAX hotels I have stayed in.. I have to assume it's the paper thin walls and shoddy construction...but hey, it's a Four Points.;3
This is a basic hotel with a free shuttle to and from LAX departing every 15 minutes. We were happy to easily find the shuttle upon exiting the airport and were happy that the hotel had a bar restaurant open late so we could order food after our late flight.  The beds are comfortable. The hotel has had a 'makeover' renovation, however, still is quite old-but they did a good job considering. This is a good value for the money, because it was clean, convenient, had a free shuttle and the ammenities. and we spent $130 for one night. The downside was the lack of electrical outlets near the beds on the bedside tables, or on the dresser/desk combo unit which housed the TV. I have designed hotels for years in the hospitality industry, and per code, there should be outlets available;3
"From the moment that we checked in, Lupe Valdovinos who I believe is an Asst. Manager was the most helpful and attentive team member.  She graciously handled all of our needs; moved us to another room with a pool view when we mentioned that we thought the room was small and not the deluxe that was confirmed.  She also helped out tremendously when I continued to face internet connectivity issues.  She's an allstar and did everything with a friendly warm smile.  I'd recommend your property simply because I know that she will help guests have a great stay. All staff were very friendly and helpful as we made our way through your property.";4
There are plenty of LAX hotels and would shop around before staying here   The parking is non existent My room (416) got no wifi signal ( used my data on my phone)  Could hear planes very loudly right over my room until 11pm The bed was rock hard The pillows were a joke. Hardly and feathers or support on them. Almost paper thin for one of them. I needed 4 pillows to be able to watch tv in bed and woke up sore and tired all three mornings I was stuck here  At times the elevator lines are crazy. 3 elevators are not enough for a hotel this size  No free breakfast when you consider at least half the competition here offers it.  Forget about trying to get coffee or bagels in the morning, the breakfast shop takes forever and very slow  Asked the housekeeper to leave us toothpaste and;2
I was in transit for 2 days and book the hotel from LA airport and was surprised by not only the value but how competent and obliging the staff were. Nothing was a bother to them. From the front desk to the Bell person including the concierge were friendly and helpful. I was traveling with my special needs sister and the staff made sure that we were comfortable and saved us in inconvenience of catching the train to San Diego by advising to get a shuttle which was cheaper. The room was spacious and very  modern. I will be back there for sure;5
The hotel was in a great location (by LAX), the staff was great but the room was average at best. There was no mini refrigerator in the room & the A/C was ok. Did not like the $21 per night parking fee. Despite the great staff, I would not recommend this hotel for a family vacation.;3
I flew in from Australia, and had and 18 hour layover (my office is trying to cut cost) in LAX. At 8 am I called the Four Points for a day room and was told they would have a room for me in 1 hour and to wait for the shuttle. I got to the hotel at 8:40am and my room was ready. Slept the entire day and checked out. Nice, quiet and clean;4
This was located in an absolutely excellent location and it was right across from our car rental (Budget) so we booked this the last evening of our trip for ease to get to the airport the next morning.  We were very pleased with this hotel.  It is lovely inside, the room was large, the beds very comfortable and a good pool.  The only negative thing to comment on was there was some mold around the bathtub and the door at the bottom left hand side (Room 223) that should be taken care of but other than this, we were quite happy and we definitely stay here next time we are in LA if only for its closeness to the airport and there is a shuttle service making it so easy for us.  There are excellent facilities inside the hotel and really, other than the mold issue which I feel sure will;4
Great hotel for the airport, good bars, pool area is great, and the restaurant options at the hotel are very good.  They have a great managers reception at times there and we were lucky to catch it while staying here.  The rooms are on par with what you would expect with a Sheraton. There was some construction going on but even that didn't effect my stay.  I'd stay again.;5
This is another good choice if you need a overnight near LAX airport. Comfortable, clean and very close. The room was very good and large. We booked a sale on Booking.com and we really liked it. I didn't understand the bad rewies. It is just a place to sleep with a good quality. If you want to visit LAX it is a long distance from the city.;4
I had to check in day earlier which was handled very well and allowed to stay in same room for next day and 1/2 ( original booking).  Staff were fantastic as I had to ask questions to quite a few. I had many shopping boxes for my kids and asked where I could put cardboard. I was led by cleaner to a place to leave near a stair well and they were gone 1/2 hour later which ensured no other guests were inconvenienced. I had trouble printing off some custom documents at the business centre as the PDF format was different. Johnny at reception asked for me to forward to him and he then printed them off - excellent solution to my problem. The pool area was great to relax at until time to check out. Breakfast was very good but would suggest order buffet as can get exactly what you want;5
The room and hotel in general was tidy and clean.  I checked in late in the evening and the staff were helpful.  The bathroom door wasn't in the best condition as it did not close so you had to shower with the door open into the room.  The checkout was interesting, one staff member and each checkout took quite some time. Another staff member joking some ten minutes into my wait to assist however the queue was now substantially long.  In general a tidy hotel and good for a nights rest.;4
Our room was smelly, masked with cleaning fluid smells when we arrived but that wore off. The bed and pillows were good as well as the towels.  It was overall an ok experience but I wouldn't recommend this place as a vacation spot.  We did not hear any planes so we slept well.;3
Service is good. Staffs are friendly. However, the 100 year-old air con in the room completely destroys my patience. It was way too noisy during the night.  Breakfast is okay with an omelet and buffet.  Wifi is fast.;2
It's not an expensive hotel. It is what it is. There are no breath taking views are anything like that. The hotel is not far from the airport, parking is free, they offer breakfast for a small charge. The rooms are clean, the people are helpful and nice and the hotel is quiet. The room was about $125;4
Recently I have had to stay overnight to attending business meetings on two occasions.  Both times, I chose the package that includes parking that allows in-and-out privileges without incurring additional parking fees.    I was impressed with how crisp, clean and WHITE the lines look and feel. Also, the bed and pillows are extremely soft making it that much harder to get out of bed to attend my meetings.  Great value, clean and all staff members have been consistently courteous and attentive to my needs.;5
Stayed at this hotel in while attending a Bussiness meeting in Los Angeles. The location is great, with a shopping centre across the road. It's about 15 minutes drive from LAX and 10 minutes drive from Beverly Hills. My room was neat and clean and the breakfast was great. Definitely value for money.;4
We've stayed at the Four Points LAX three times now.  We generally stay for one night to break our journey or simply because we can't get connecting flights.  The LAX shuttle bus service is excellent (as it is to all LAX hotels).  The Four Points is above average for a business class hotel in the LAX area and subject to seasonal fluctuations generally well priced - but at the end of the day it is a chain hotel at LAX and there is only so much that you can expect from any of these places.  We have seemed to settle on the Four Points after trying a number of the LAX properties though.  The current refurbishment has been a little disappointing (not that it is being refurbished but how management have handled the disruption it is causing!).  There was no advice on the website about;3
My stay at the Four Points LAX is always great. I stay in the area at least 6 or 7 times a year and I never had a single problem.  Do not hesitate to book your stay here the next time you are in the LAX area.;5
We had two rooms in this hotel for 3 days. One of the rooms didn't have shampoo, and conditioner and refrigerator. After we contacted them about it, they added shampoo, but didn't add conditioner.  We also had a billing issue. We had an unknown charge that we never got receipt. So I have been tried to call them several times and left voice mails. Their accountant's voice mail said that they would get back to me in 1 business day, but I haven't heard back from them and it's been a week since I first called.;2
Nothing much to tell. Average hotel. Airport area. Nothing stood out to me except for the unusually bad coffee at the hotel cafe. Seriously. I opted for the Starbucks inside another hotel on the next block.;3
Stay there for almost 11 hours after long haul flight from Hong Kong.  Experience, opinion and impression :  very near to LAX airport, reach there using hotel airport shuttle running around the clock. very classic hotel.  hotel staff efficient and want to help they have several meeting rooms, it is also conference hotel I suppose. lobby bar seems busy. saw one outdoor pool near lobby. I stay @ the tower with 8th floor as the highest floor. they have at least two different areas of elevators, seems serving different hotel tower. I do not have a chance to enjoy their breakfast service. I stay @ one of their suite, large room, bath room is not the biggest. TV is large, working desk is nice. Suite room is overall nice, with sofa as well. Bed is EXTREMELY comfortable to have a good;3
"The only reason I am giving this place a four-star rating is simply because of the parking situation.  The lot is small and you may not be able to find a parking stall.  The attendants, however, are awesome and help you as best as they can.  If you, unfortunately, get stuck behind an idiot that didn't obtain their parking pass, can't open the gate to get out, and won't reverse to get out of the way and let you out, that's another issue.    All the staff we came in contact with were great and very helpful.  The staff in the lobby restaurant was also very pleasant and the food excellent.  The room is spacious, although you may get a little confused and ""lost"" as there are different towers and the signs are a bit confusing, but who cares - once you get to your room, it's all good .";4
My wife had her passport stolen in Palm Springs so we had to find weekend accommodation to await the Consulate opening on the Monday in LA. We simply looked at a list at the airport and my wife phoned and booked and we arrived an hour later. The room was fine with a TV mini fridge and all that you needed. Our room was on the 6th floor overlooking the freeway that never stops. The hotel has an outdoor pool . We used the bar and had a nice meal their on the Sunday evening. The staff friendly. We took a taxi ride into Hollywood about 30 minutes.. and 20 minutes to the airport depending on traffic. All in all a pleasant stay.;4
You're paying for convenience - not ambiance. Staff was courteous. Hotel is very dated. Rooms are small. Bathroom was very small.   Elevators were slow.   Bar had a great variety of beers.   Shuttle runs 24 hours but stops at multiple locations. Plan accordingly.;3
We arrived on a Saturday morning around 2am just for one night before heading on to travels in the morning. Check-in was down because the hotel was doing their nightly batch process. It might be a good idea to have a contingency plan since this is an airport hotel. Making your guests wait 20 minutes to check-in at 2am isn't a good idea. The room was adequate for sleeping and showering and the pillows on the bed were comfortable.;3
"Pro -Good (but expensive) meals at hotel restaurant Cons -Shuttle bus from airport should run more often as it was overcrowded with not even any standing room left -Check-in and check-out take excessively long; the actual area they use for check in/out is similar to what you would find for a 50 room hotel and this has far more rooms; the lineup for checkout grew so long that they started handing out 1 cookie to each customer in line to attempt to appease them -there is no soap dispenser for the sink that is outside the washroom and the soap dispenser for the tub was empty -staff talk loudly and endlessly in the halls making it very difficult to sleep particularly in the mornings -the elevators are very slow and mean excessive wait times to get an elevator going down that is not";2
"As some other reviewers have mentioned this hotel is undergoing a renovation and some of the new sections look quite nice. It's not the first time I have encountered a hotel undergoing renovation and it's one of those things you see if you travel enough on business. It's weird that they have moved the (temporary) reception area right to the very BACK of the hotel. So go in the front door and join the treasure hunt!   I am sure there are some nice rooms here but I stayed (in fact still here while writing...) in what is called the Center Tower (though ""tower"" is a bit of a misnomer and sounds too grand - more like one of those tunnels the animals run along in a gerbil cage). In fact on exiting the elevator I couldn't figure out where the room was since the arrows seemed to point";2
Just did not enjoy my stay at this hotel at all. it took over 40 mins to get a shuttle to the hotel from LAX. Coz of that the bus was packed -> there was a line to check in.   I checked in at around 10pm and went straight to bed after a drink at the bar. Stayed in room 612 or 614 i can't remember. in the hall overlooking the pool - housekeeping or maintenance could not give a damn about visitors in their room at this hour. They talked extremely loud, vaccumed sth and would shout out to each other from opposing ends of the hall. It made me feel not angry - but kinda as if i was staying at a stranger's house. I had to complain twice to shut them up. it took over half an hour for them to leave the hall.   My room rate did not include breakfast - didn't expect that. I paid a decent;2
Between the crappy Internet and the paper thin walls, I have to say I was so appreciative of my sleeping pills. This is a very beautiful hotel and they are renovating it, but when your in your room and you want to entertain yourself with whatever gadgets you bring don't depend on the hotel Internet to keep you entertained.;3
This hotel is an airport hotel close to LAX. The hotel has easy parking behind the building for a rate which is about the same as most other LAX Airport hotels. The hotel has a moderate lobbel, a nice pool and a sportsbar next to the reception. All are average, not spectacular. The rooms we have been in all had a strange muffy smell, but the most important thing there is that the rooms are not the same. Be carefull with what you book and ask what you will get.   They have divided the hotel into different parts, one on the streetside and one closer to the back entrance (parking lot). The most annoying thing is that when it's too busy (like when they host a convention) they even use rooms that have no outside windows, yes indeed no outside windows. We unfortunately had one (and;2
Not only was the room big, clean, quiet and a great view....Juan, Julian and Jazmin were amazing to me!  The are the standard bearer for customer service. Each one of them helped my in many ways and even recognized me when I had a question.  I stay in LA about 4 or 5 times a month and this is my only place to stay.  Thank you, JJJ (you guys made my day and made my stay the best).;5
Even though the hotel is under renovation their courteous, friendly and approachable staff make a real difference for a very comfortable stay.They offer convenient and complimentary LAX shuttle.  Affordable pricing for the room stay as well as variety of choices on the menu at the restaurant and bar lounge. Relaxing swimming pool along side the 24 hour accessible fitness center. Easy access on/off the freeway to downtown LA. The staff make an extraordinary impact on the experience.;5
"This hotel is very convenient for travelers in and out of LAX. Currently the ""front"" desk is located in the back of the hotel as renovations throughout the first floor continue. Very friendly and helpful staff. When I arrived, I was told that if I provided my email address, I would be upgraded to a room with a king-sized bed. So, I did, and when I arrived at my room, I found two double beds. So, I returned to the desk, got another set of room keys and got a room with a king-sized bed, but there was no chair at the desk, so I had to go back to the reception desk to ask that one be delivered. Room needed updating; cracked bathroom sink, furniture had scratches and nicks. I was in the ""middle tower;"" window looks out onto a long corridor, not the out of doors. Request a room in one";3
This is a very nice property in a good area near LAX.  Food choices at the on site restaurant are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected this close to the airport.  Staff was friendly.  Rooms were soundproofed well.  We got a good nights sleep.  Complimentary USA Today was a nice touch.  Shuttle to the airport was on time and the driver was very professional.  I would stay here again.;4
"We stayed at this hotel prior to a return flight home.  Despite California being in one of the worst droughts in history, there was absolutely no sort of flow restriction on the tub and shower.  It was appalling t see how many gallons went down the drain in a matter of SECONDS.  Despite the stupid ""we're going green and saving water by making you use your towels more than once"" :  (translation: we are saving money on laundry) they are showing their true colors by not changing out the shower heads.  Won't stay there again.";2
The hotel is wonderful , many great and large rooms , has a good price and is very well located . I loved this hotel. Its a beautiful hotel. The restaurant its wonderful too. Congratularions!!! I come back certily!;5
Short walk to / from Lot C (long term parking), a short complimentary shuttle bus ride to the terminals, & a very good restaurant is located on the first floor. Besides that, the cost was reasonable, the room was clean, quite, and had comfortable beds. And the customer service was great!;4
With a friendly staff this hotel is a convenient sleep over for the tired traveler. Rooms are clean,free wiifi but with a tiny bathroom. There is a free shuttle to the airport. Food is good and room service is quick...what more could you need?;4
I fly in and out of LAX several times a year and always stay at a hotel close to LAX before departure.  I always look for the best prices at nice places with LAX shuttle service.  This was my third or fourth stay at Four Points and it is consistently clean, comfortable, with excellent customer service.  The rooms are not fancy but the rates were very reasonable for the quality of the facility. The food at the bar was quite good.  Prices were a bit high, but that is typical for the area.  I'll go back.;4
We have stayed several times at the Four Points Sheraton LAX over the years.  Each time we have been extremely satisfied with the friendly staff, excellent service and comfortable rooms.  The value of the park, sleep and fly combination is unbeatable.;5
This hotel is a winner, price, quality, staff, amenities, location. All are first class. I have stayed here a lot of the past months - to many to count. Currently in remodel mode, but just a minor inconvenience. Staff is always friendly, especially a guy named Baltazar at the front desk, his smile and professional service make him a valuable Sheraton employee. Staying again this week.;5
Rooms were clean and very nice.Staff went out of their way to make your stay an experience to remember.Restaurant was also great. Conciege (Terasa) was a great help with my lost baggage from our flight, also arranged someone to pick us up , for our cruise out of San Pedro ......will definitely stay there again;5
Stayed in the double bed room. Was comfortable for 4 adults, considering the price and the  sumptuous breakfast coupons that it included. Breakfast had full service and quality as well as variety of items.  Overall the double bedroom was a great value for 4 adults on a short visit.;4
The rooms are a sort of minimal modern style. No bad. The hotel is clean and nice. The hallways reminded me a bit of the shining. For me that was very cool. :) There's a nice bar and restaurant that seems pretty lively. I would stay here again.;3
The hotel was very busy but this is to be expected at an airport hotel.  It is undergoing renovations currently which could add to the busyness at the front desk. Rooms are tired, food at the Italian restaurant was average.  Room service and maintenance staff were fantastic, cant say the same about the wait staff or bar staff.  Front desk reception was great on check in but check out staff were very rude.;3
On our return from Europe, we ended up spending a night at the Sheraton courtesy of Delta  because of a flight delayed and then cancelled.  Their pick up service is excellent and they are just a few blocks from LAX.  The rooms are nice size, up to date and clean with excellent beds and A/C controls.   The TV is hard to manipulate as there is a big lag when changing channels.  They also have lots of rooms...the place is huge.  However, this is an old property and it shows it.   The bar downstairs has stuffing coming out of the furniture, the tables and area are nicked up and look used.  The whole place is sort of tired.  But it looks like a remodel may be underway.  That could make a big difference.  But if all you need is a place for the night...it's just fine.  No real;4
My girlfriend and I stayed at the four points and it was exactly what we expect from a major hotel chain. Nice and clean, spacious and comfotable. Close to the airport, with a free shuttle as well. Hotel food was great and the staff was very helpful in sorting out any issues we had. Great place to stay if you need to be close to the airport. Not close to a beach or much tourist attractions but its close to public transport stops and also tour bus stops. Overall a very nice hotel. I would stay in this hotel again, simply because of the great service and being so close to the airport.;4
The very good rating is for the hotel not the city. The Four Points Hotel was lovely and was close to the airport and other necessities on the streets. LA is a different kind of city that was a conglomerate of all sorts of different towns it seemed all smashed into one name. Beverly Hills was really nice to look at as was the walk of fame but be prepared to be approached a lot by the street goers dressed up in all sorts of costumes for pictures. Griffith Observatory was really cool as well!! Definitely worth a visit. The Hollywood sign is definitely over rated. I wouldn't go to LA again but if you lots of money to blow, stop by Rodeo Dr and let loose. You may be lucky to get 2 sweaters for 300 bucks.;4
Christina and the rest of the crew serve up great food and drink.  So many great tap options and the staff is great!  I had the vegan chili.  Very nicely done.  The pretzels at the bar are an added plus.  Stone Ruination IPA on tap is great!;5
"Conveniently located near LAX, this is a good sized hotel with all the amenities.  I must agree with some of the more recent reviewers in that the overall appearance is a bit ""tired"" and the furnishings are somewhat ""dated.""  However, the beds are comfortable, the water is hot (and the water pressure is good), and the room was immaculate.  Free parking, free wi-fi, and a restaurant on site.  I would stay here again.";3
My wife and I stayed here on May 7th and again on May 13th.  The first night we had a room in the East tower.  The room was clean.  The hall ways had dirty carpet.  The second night we had a room in the West tower.  The room was dated and the bathroom had the older counter tops and was smaller.  The West tower room had only two bath towels, no lotion, no garbage can in the sleeping area.  It appeared to be a room that was no normally used.  The hotel is under some renovation and the Check in desk is at the back of the hotel.  When the shuttle bus drops you off at the front of the hotel, you have to walk thru the hotel to the back side to check in.  A little inconvient.;3
What a dump, dump, dump. This hotel is awful. The hotel is newly renovated. It is like putting lipstick on a pig. The furniture in the rooms are terribly dirty and the bathrooms have broken tiles on the walls and dirty grimy ceiling fans. The van service to the hotel is very inconsistent. If you stay at this establishment  you must leave  extra  early get to the airport on time.;1
I had an unplanned overnight stay at LAX and booked this hotel because it was close, had a shuttle, and was a decent price. I have stayed at almost all of the LAX area hotels including the Westin, Marriott, And Hilton. I wasn't too picky because I had less than 8 hours before my next flight.  The room I got was strange to say the least. There was a corridor with a window to the outside, and then interior doors to the rooms. All of these rooms do not have windows (other than a big window onto the hallway). Not a huge deal since I just wanted to sleep but extremely odd in 2015. There was no soundproofing and you could hear people waking up and down the hallways through the thin glass.  I walked into the room and the desk chair leather jumped out at me (see pic). I wouldn't sit in;2
Had a nice view of hollywood sign from our room.  Though the sign was far, it was alright especially for some members of our family who were first time visitors, their photos were good. Just stayed for 1 night just to spend the night after 16 hours flight from Manila. Then, drove to Las Vegas the following day.;4
!st time in Four Points LAX.  I called previous to my arrival with all my guest to seek help with transportation options, and room specific request.  The staff was terrific and knowledgeable, so helpful and cordial, Martin Gil was my first contact and we were so delighted, as Martin included all the staff to provide the different support for us and our guests.  They saved us a tonne of time and money with their support and the alternatives provided by the different staff we were directed to, including the business services and the bell-person who took the time to show us where to go and always greeted us with a great big smile, as was Martin and Juan.  I want to compliment this helpful staff who made a great difference for us, and loved their always caring and positive demeanor.;5
The lobby and extrance are nice, but the room was by far the worst I have EVER stayed in (and I travel a lot). The room smelled, was noisey, like a motel, no outside windows. I srayed there 5 hours, but that was far too long. Not what I have experienced at other four points.;1
"It was my first time staying in an airport hotel in LAX. After looking thru a couple of websites and reading a couple of reviews, four points was the right mix between price and convenience   A couple of things I loved about the hotel:  1) the airport shuttle- there's a complementary airport shuttle to/from LAX. When exiting any terminal in LAX, just follow the signs to ""hotel courtesy pick up"". The shuttle doesn't run as often as the others but it shouldn't be longer than a 15 minute wait in between shuttles   2) the rooms- the rooms are decently sized for an airport hotel and  considering the price I paid.    3) room service- I ordered room service and they have a 30 minute guarantee. The food was great for airport hotel standards and relatively reasonably priced   Some points";3
This place is a scam. The photos look nice. In really the rooms are tiny and there are NO windows!!! There is a fake window facing the hallway. Furthermore, the service was horrible. We arrived really late, since the plane was delayed. The room was precooked and paid for online. The lady in reception told us that the system is down and we need to wait outside 20 min. After the wait she gave us the keys. When we came to the room they gave us a one full bed room, while we paid and requested a two full beds room. I called them back and we had to go back again and get that changed. That might not be an issue when you have a weekend ahead of you. But this is an airport hotel. We arrived at 3 am, to take of on a new plane at 8 am in the morning and wasted 1 hour of our sleep waiting;1
Nice hotel near LAX that offers free shuttle to and from airport. Runs every 20 minutes. Hotel was nice and spacious. Visited the bar for a quick bite to eat. Food was good and fast service. Very comfortable rooms and furnishings Hotel looks to have just been renovated. Would recommend this hotel;5
I would definitely stay at the Four Points again, and would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to be in the LAX area. The staff was friendly, and totally looked out for your well being, and making sure your every need was met.;5
The most impressive thing I observed while staying at Four Points Sheraton was Juan Vazquez.  I was sitting in the lobby awaiting the arrival of a friend.  Juan was at the front desk.  I observed a long stay guest with a small dog approach the front desk and set the dog on the counter.  Juan was very helpful and kind to both the guest and the dog.  When the guest left and was out of sight, Juan took out cleaner and cleaned the counter.  Dog owners believe Everyone loves their dog, but Juan is correct.  Dogs leave dander and dog scent everywhere.  I was very impressed that Juan cleaned the counter and equally impressed with how helpful and kind he was to the guest.  Never flinching at the dog on the counter. I went to the counter when my friend arrived and confirmed his name.  If;4
I stayed there for 3 nights with 3 friends, when we made our reservation it allow us to reserve one room for 4 persons so we were expecting a least 2 king size beds but we were surprised with 2 queen beds, the room smells bad and the ventilation of the bathroom is not working, wifi is too bad and keep disconnecting .... I believe it is suitable for airport travelers where you are only staying for some hours;2
We have stayed several times at four points. The staff are very friendly especially the hard working concierge staff that welcome you to the hotel and look after your bags. Rooms are spacious and are clean we are conscious of California's water shortage . So try and hang up our towels if staying more than one night. Car rentals are around the corner a couple of blocks  and there is a free shuttle from lax to the hotel leaves every 20 minutes . So easy to check in and worry about the rental the next day if you have travelled  a long flight . We always bring our own GPS and have no trouble driving on the other side . The roads are wide and there are good sign posts in English. It is also well positioned to catch a bus to nearby manhatten beach it's about 5.00  round trip. You can;4
My stay was great and I want others to know about the excellent staff here at the four points. First,  I was greeted by a receptionist named john who took great care of my check in process and assigned me a great room. Excellent WiFi service with no lag or drop even on the seventh floor. The gym was standard but the pool is parallel to none and especially the model type flight attendants as eye candy.  There is a great restaurant inside the hotel with a huge beer and wine selection and excellent breakfast buffet at checkout.;5
"I experienced fast and friendly service from the check in staff, who conscientiously opened a new line to handle the 6 waiting customers.    As a frequent traveler, I am not accustomed to seeing this kind of outstanding service, so I was very pleasantly surprised.   My next surprise was in the restaurant. While the prices were a little high, the service was impeccable. Despite it being a ""seat yourself"" venue, (and totally full with standing room only) one of the waitresses found me a table within a few minutes and brought me over there.  The service as outstanding all the way through until time to pay the bill.   What a great hotel!!";4
After a long flight from Heathrow, but with a free shuttle and a great craft beer list and some lovely pulled pork, what more could you want.Well a bit more time would be nice, I think that there was at least 75 odd beers on the list, well worth a visit;5
"Ok, so we booked this hotel because they advertise a park and fly option with a hotel overnight stay. However, this can only be booked through the hotels own reservation system. We booked a special room rate through Tripadvisor. Hotel would not honor the park and fly option when the booking is made through ""others"". We had to scramble to find a suitable parking lot at a competitive price, and which we did with Fox park and rent group.. Long story aside from the inconvenience the total cost .";4
I think this was probably the fastest check-in on record (now granted I am a Starwood member and have stayed at numerous properties but not this one) as it took the front desk less than a minute to get me my keys and swipe the card.  The room was very spacious with a comfortable bed and the property is very quiet (no airplane noise or noise from other guests, who are all here for the same reason- to catch an early flight).  The shuttle, which we used in the morning, left right at 6AM and the driver was prompt and got us to ticketing in about 10 minutes (and he was very friendly).  The property has a LARGE fitness room, a pool, a place to eat on site, and a great staff with clean and comfortable rooms.  I did not see any flaws for the very affordable price and would stay here;4
Four Points Hotel has a very warm atmosphere by its personnel. All people are very friendly andhelpful. Especially Farook at concierge fully dedicated to customer requests. The hotel is near to LAX at 5 minutes and has a large parking lot. The rooms are a bit small. House keeping is wonderful. I had dropped my wallet at corridor. The housekeer found and kept it I apprciate her honesty. 4 Points is always a good choice.;5
La airport hotels are all well past their sell by date but this one is ok, rooms ok but the staff make the place. They were super flexible  re times and just nice and friendly, a total reverse of the rude and overpriced  Radisson yet motel procing.  Total credit to the site managers, it is obvious that someone cares. Usual rip off parking and bar prices but is somehow ok to berobbed in afriendly way !;5
We only stayed overnight one night in order to catch a flight out early the next morning. Our Starwood Preferred Guest room on the 5th floor was old and dated and needed remodeling. We didn't use any of the facilities so no comment there... The location is excellent-only a few blocks from LAX and the service at the front desk was friendly and efficient. The internet price of $115.00 per night plus fees seemed very reasonable for the location.;3
I arrived at LA airport at around 11pm and it took me too long (~30 mins) to have the free shuttle pickup.  When I was waiting at the courtesy pick up zone, I could see shuttle of other hotels for a number of times eg Hilton ~4 times, Crowne Plaza ~4 times, Sheraton (not this Four Points by Sheraton) ~ 3 times.  My shuttle had to go through a few more terminals to pick up other guests and further with the 5-10 mins drive, it means that I had taken 45 mins to reach the hotel.  It's frustrating and defeat the purpose as an airport hotel.  Having said so, the driver is very friendly and nice which set off much of my discontent during waiting.  The room is basic.  Perhaps I was too tired after a 15 hr flight, so I slept well.  The bed is very comfy.  No views for every room as all;3
Good hotel for an airport stay-over. Biggest disappointment the restaurant was closed for lunch.... my cousins and 86 yr old uncle had driven 2 hrs from San Diego to see me in transit from Australia to Cartagena/Colombia and i'd specifically booked a Sheraton expecting normal facilities. The pool area also had no open bar/food service despite 85 deg F temp's.  Room clean and adequate. Bedding good. Yes wifi included. Friendly check-in, but a queue....same with check-out, but there was a conference on (so why not more staff???) Hard to locate ice machine... NOT where they said...only on 7th floor!!! Reception no help but maids were (thank-you) Bathroom amenities not normal Sheraton extensive range. First time @ a 4-points... normally a Westin or Sheraton guest, so good;4
Details, Details, Details.  This property has, for the most part, figured out that details are important to customers.  Check-in, quick, painless, with a friendly smile, key and go.  Concierge staff ready and willing to assist with baggage.  Rooms spacious, clean and yes, SOUNDPROOF.  When I looked out the window, there it was LAX airstrip without the noise of an airport.  Well done.  Bathrooms with appropriate amenities, plush towels and a bed that was perfect along with several tv stations.  Close to the airport.  A few miscues though.  First, the entrance is NOT clearly marked for the location of the front desk. One must look up to the ceiling for the sign.  Please.  Also, the next morning, I was advised that the shuttle ran frequently so I planned accordingly.  When I asked;5
Arrived here from a long flight and in the early hours of the morning.  The staff were very welcoming and efficient and we were quickly checked in. The room was a very good size and the bathroom had every amenity. The beds were super comfortable and the room was very quiet. Was an added bonus to awake the next morning and find that there was a view of the Hollywood Hills! Went to breakfast and that was great too...wonderful selection and the wait staff were very good;4
Yes, it is little older. but the service is excellent. check in seamless, especially juan at  front desk-restaurant nothing special, but the bar and surroundings are fine. pool is clean and warm. plenty of parking, for long term check out their specials. I always stay here before leaving from lax. you can open the windows ,which for me is great option as the a/c is brutal sometimes. fridge in the rooms, and bellman sharpe and quick.;5
Close to airport with free shuttle: that's why we stayed there. No free breakfast, lousy coffee maker in the room, no free parking. Our room had broken tiles in the bath and other features in real need of attention.    The staff was all excellent and trying very hard.  Sheraton just needs to pour a bunch of money into the place.;3
I debated on a 2 or 3 star rating, would have assigned 2 1/2 if possible.  I stayed here for work only one night (thankfully).  On the plus side, the staff is quite friendly and helpful, and the lobby is nice.  The room however left much to be desired.  This property is in severe need of a facelift.  The building is quite old and at one point must have been a motel with all rooms leading to an outside hallway.  Now the hallway has been closed in with just windows leading to outside.  So the rooms have a windowthat leads to the hallway, which in turn has windows looking outside.  I felt like I had stepped back in time about 20 years - while the furniture in the room is more modern, unfortunately this does not hide the age of the room itself and some of the fixtures (towel holder;2
We stayed at Four Points for one night between flights.  The hotel is really close to the airport - maybe a 10min drive on the hotel's airport shuttle.  The room itself was great. Nice and clean.  Spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 children.  Beds and pillows were comfortable.  The food in the restaurant downstairs was really nice and they have great kids meals.  Our kids had salmon and veggies - not just the standard pizza and fries that are always on kids menus.  The bar next to it was also very nice and had a great ambience to it with travellers coming in and out.  There is a big outdoor pool which the kids enjoyed and also a good fitness centre.  We went to Santa Monica for the day and it was a $35/40 cab ride from the hotel.  There is also a shuttle bus that runs to;5
The good. Friendly staff at every encounter. Room was comfortable and the obvious effort to make it arrival ready was appreciated. Very convenient for LAX rental car and airport maneuvering without highway traffic. The not-so-much. STAFF TOO FRIENDLY...slowed down service...people staying here are likely in a hurry and don't want to listen to yappy staff wasting time, especially if the time wasted is on somebody else, and you wait ten minutes to check in, or you never get the requested cup of coffee at breakfast. Parking is a pain and it would be better to return the car and then shuttle to LAX +++ except +++ the shuttle wait was GINORMOUS!, more than I've ever seen at any hotel on planet Earth. Hint: there is parking underneath the ramp entrance to the parking lot, much closer;3
Returning to LA was an experience I so looked forward to, as it is one of my favorite places.  Staying at a Sheraton, I was expecting a 1st class thrill.  What I received was a small room with no amenities like microwave or fridge unless paid extra. Bottled water was provided but only 1 small bottle for 2 adults. Bathroom door was rusted, room itself needed some repairs and the thermostat set on 85 blew cold air keeping the room at 64. The personnel were so trained they appeared to operate as robots in fear of loosing their jobs rather than anyone who actually cared. Two employees stood out- 1 in maintenance and 1 server for breakfast who took care of clientele as if they wanted to help.  We were in LA for a convention and amazingly the front desk did not know enough information;2
I chose this 'Hotel' as it was marginally less expensive than other other hotels in the area near the airport, the hotel I usually stay in had doubled its prices since my last trip! After an 11 hour flight all I want is a clean QUIET room with a comfortable bed so I can get a good nights sleep. Everything seemed fine, check in was quick and staff were friendly, the problems began when I exited the lift /elevator looking for my room. As you exit the lift /elevator you won't find traditional corridors with doors leading to rooms but doors marked exit which lead out on to glazed corridors, the first thing I saw was an ice machine and vending machines, I thought I had taken a wrong turn and was in a service area or emergency exit but no this is where the rooms are located! The rooms;2
We always stay at the Four Points LAX before our 7 am flight.  There's 24 hour shuttle to the airport and the car rental agencies are a short walk from the hotel so we can check in, take the bags to the room, and then return the car.  We can't comment on the restaurant or gym.  WiFi is good and free.;4
If you're looking for some place to stay one night before or after your flight it's ok. The front desk attendant was nearly rude with me, the parking lot (U$ 20,00 + tax) was completely full and i had to keep driving around until i found a spot. The rooms are clean but very old, just like the whole hotel. The price is ok (i paid U$ 99,00 + tax) for 1 night. Probably there were better hotels around but next time i'll choose another SPG property.;2
It was 2002 the first time I was at Four Points Sheraton LAX. Now, 13th years later I was there once again with my Family and still a GREAT hotel! Awesome service and attentions, nice clean & comfortable rooms. THANKS.;5
This a great place to stay if you have an early flight out, or come in on the red eye. With free shuttles running every 15 minutes to/from the airport, this hotel offers not only easy access to weary travelers, but outstanding customer service once you get there. Beautiful room with clean, comfortable beds. Hot shower. Quiet. Reasonably priced. Hint: Buy your snacks elsewhere. Prices in the gift shop are nothing short of highway robbery!;4
I stayed here for one night on a quick visit to LA.  The hotel is pretty average.  They advertise 24 hour check-in but that's only if you book through them  For some reason they cant extend that to third party bookings despite calling ahead of time and annotating it on the reservation.  When my friend and I finally did get back late at night to checkin to the hotel the parking situation was atrocious.  Not only do they charge you a daily rate for parking even though the car was parked for all of 7 hours there were no spaces.  After driving around a bit and hearing from another guest that there was underground parking somewhere i finally found ti with only a few spots left.  What kind of hotel doesn't have enough parking for its guests???  In the lot there are no signs indicating;2
Great price, great location. Room was clean and internet service was free. The pool area is nice but wishing they had a hot-tub.  Airport shuttle runs every 20 minutes which was a blessing! I will stay here again and again.;5
Because of a last minute change in plans needed 2 spend a couple of nights near LAX. This property was located very near the airport and had complimentary shuttle service which I believe was available 24/7. Because of circumstances got to the hotel around 9 am and while room wasn't available at that time was told would have one ready in about an hour so I went and had breakfast and when I was done the room was ready and I was able to check in early which was greatly appreciated. Room was very nice and everything about the stay and service was top notch.;5
Warm welcome after a long drive down to LA, and we were checked in quickly. Room was clean and spacious, as was the bathroom. Only downside was someone had set the in room alarm clock to go off at 4.10am...not fun!;4
We stayed at Four Points Hotel after a 10 hour flight from Fiji. We were tired and mainly looking for somewhere to rest and sleep for the afternoon and evening. We were able to take the free hotel shuttle bus by the airport, even though we had not booked. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly and offered us a standard double room for £70($109). The room was clean and spacious. We had two double beds, spoilt for choice! The bedding was comfy and soft, especially the marshmallow like pillows - can easily fall asleep! Nice size tv to relax and chill with various channels. Only 3km away from the airport so it's not in the centre but we were happy just to catch up on sleep and rest to allow us to explore the next day. There is a convenience store across the road and if;4
We have stayed here several times and have encountered issues during each stay.  Though they may have been minor they add up and leaves a bitter taste about our experience. The saving grace has always been the service and genuine apology. Having been in the business over 25 years one gets to see how the team handles each opportunity. On this last stay Martin Jil. Took the time to listen generously and apologized ensuring that we felt heard. As we could not be refunded he offered compensation that fit the family. Martin is a great representative of what the Starwood BRAND training is all about and we are happy they invest time in this kind of training that sets Starwood apart from the competition. It's not about the compensation, It's about the approach and service passion.;4
Flew into LAX late. Stayed here for a night before an evening flight out of LAX the next day. Caught the shuttle, quick and convenient. Food in Brewster's bar was good.  Beds clean and comfortable. Had a late checkout the next day so plenty of time for a walk around, swim and relax. Helpful and friendly staff. Free WiFi. There is a convenience store behind the Budget car hire office across the road on W98th st. for all manner of supplies and a Burger King across the road to the right.;5
I stayed here for four nights this month. The location is convenient in one respect because it's very close to LAX, also there is a free shuttle service that runs from the airport to the hotel very regularly. The only downside location-wise is that it's somewhat out in the sticks as LA is obviously a very large city, however If you plan on renting a car then this isn't really an issue and this hotel can act as a very good base of operations.   The staff at reception were very friendly and polite when we checked in and the staff at the concierge desk were as well. They were also very helpful and are prepared to ring you a taxi if you need one. They will also arrange for you to have a place on one of the many VIP tours. If you need to print anything off there are two free Apple;3
"We stayed here one night to catch an early flight the next morning.  As is the case with many Four Points, this was an older hotel updated  and refurbished, but still showing signs of tiredness.  We dropped our rental car off and were planning to get the car rental shuttle back to the airport and then catch the free hotel shuttle to the hotel.  Fortunately we mentioned this to the car rental shuttle driver and he dropped us off right at the hotel, which was only three blocks from the car rental returns. I wouldn't have felt safe walking it, tho.  No complaints about the hotel; it provided what we needed, the room was clean,  and the people were very nice.";3
Due to a cancel of a flight the airline paid an overnight in this hotel. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom very small, the A/C very noisy, the faucets rusty, the door doesn't close tight thus you hear everyone walking by. Overall a disappointment and we will not come back.;2
Flew from  Barelona , Spain - JFK - LAX..Layover for early flight home to KOA..Kona, Hawaii...Sheraton Lobby was clean..Front Desk not to personable at 10pm ..Shuttle Driver was overloaded and did not help with luggage. Finally got to room, Maids in hallway talking  not cleaning.  Our room was  NOT UP TO SPG STANARDS...WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN.;2
Stayed here due to cancelled flight It was a great place to stay and an excellent accommodations Made our inconvenience melt away! Very close to the airport and the shuttle runs fairly regularly Breakfast was great also and was complimentary... Can't beat that!;4
"I'm a to tier starwood customer and this is far and away th  worst starwood property I've stayed at.  Then common areas are pleasant and well maintained. However, the room and specifically the bathroom in particular in dated and worn. The tiny bathroom looks like it hasn't been updated in years and appeared shabby & dirty with mildew, stained tile grout, cracks in the wall. Toilet roll holder was broken, toilet leaked. Room was on the smaller side and while almost tolerable, could use new carpeting.  The one star bathroom drags down this ""three star"" property down to two sstar at best.  Yuck";2
I stayed the night of Friday March 13th. The next day in the afternoon I had to catch my flight back to Italy, so I decided to stay here because very close to LAX and 15 minutes away from Santa Monica....so I did some good shopping in the morning and returned my rental car (very close to the hotel). My room 217 was quite large, buffet breakfast is good. I will be back again when I must stay close to LAX!;4
I have never stayed at a Four Points, I would stay again for an overnight visit. I would not use this chain for longer stays unless I was on a budget.  The staff was nice, everything is economically designed, it is what the overnight traveler is looking for, a clean, efficient place.  The worse thing about the whole experience was the 45 minute shuttle ride, and the hotel is not at fault for that, the traffic is just horrific.;3
The room I had in the central tower was obviously converted from an outside door type to inside door by putting up windows. This makes the rooms excessively noisy since the metal doors, designed for outside, slammed shut all night long,  actually shaking the walls. The voices of everyone around me were clearly discernable sine there is zero soundproofing here. The room smelled like a public shower, musty and wet, and there was mold absolutly everywhere in the bathroom. There was water dripping down the shower wall from an indescernable source. There were hairs from the previous guests in the tub. Nasty and disgusting.;2
"Clean, comfortable room; quick SPG check-in and check-out; friendly staff; early check-in for early morning international arrivals; affordable pricing; very good restaurant; short complementary shuttle ride from LAX, but with soundproof windows...what's not to like? Stayed many times before and...well, if it ain't broke...";5
Disappointment was on the menu at this hotel from start to finish:  -Check in took more than 15 minutes, with only 2 other guests helped in front of me. Not sure how that is possible. I felt bad for the line of 6 people behind me when I went upstairs.   -The main light switch in the room did not work. Nor did 1 of the 2 bedside lamps. So I had 1 bedside lamp, and 1 lamp on the desk to light the room. This is just reflective of poor maintenance.  -No windows! Okay, that's not exactly true...I had a window to the hallway. So my options were a) close the blackout curtain to gain some privacy from the people walking down the hall, or b) deal with strangers looking directly into my room. This issue was amplified by the fact that there was hardly any lighting in the room.  -LOUD. I;2
I was in town on business and the hotel was very nice for the area and convenient to the airport and my LAX office.  The staff was amazing, the rooms were very clean and the breakfast was great.  I had dinner in the bar one night and the food was amazing and service was great.;5
The hotel was average, but the staff were helpful and exceeded expectations. The price was very affordable and since I was there for a conference parking was included - how awesome! Great experience!  Wonderful staff!;4
I really wanted to give it 4 stars, however....  Pros: 5 mins or less to LAX, zero airplane noise, nice lobby, comfortable bed, friendly staff, decent rate thru Priceline, close to restaurants & shopping, relatively safe environment, useable swimming pool, free wifi.  Cons: $21 per vehicle self-parking, loud A/C unit in room (624), A/C didn't work very well room (624), clean bathrooms but fixtures were a little dated & worn.  Overall, I would stay again if need be with a decent room rate.;3
An express mail package was delayed for several days due to weather. It arrived after I departed due to weather in the Postal network. I notified the hotel management before I left. Not only did they contact me of the package arrival but agreed to forward the package to my home address free of charge. In this effort their cooperation and support was well above my expectations and much appreciated.;5
A hotel that bears the name Sheraton!  Oh boy!  That's what I thought when I paid         $ 110 for a night at this hotel.  Not so fast.  Those $ 110 got me no breakfast, no parking and a spartan room with a window to a corridor.  Parking is $ 20.    The best way to describe the staff is soulless. They do their job but they do't really seem to care.  There's not enough staff to check you in so you have to wait.  The staff person who was supposed to carry a box to the trunk of my car started to talk to somebody half way and I had to put the box in my trunk. . of course he made the pause expecting the tip.  Don't go here, spend the money in the Best Western Plus, the HI Express or the Courtyard.;2
Nothing exciting about the room. Obviously an older hotel that has been renovated. Mattress need to be replaced and bathrooms are showing years of use. Lobby is nice and front desk staff are friendly and helpful. Free shuttle service to the airport is great. Brewsters bar in the lobby is excellent.;3
"We initially booked this place because it was a cheaper nightly rate than other hotels in the area, and it had a pool (a must for our kids).   The room was adequate and seemed clean until I noticed blood on the curtain (ew!) The air conditioner offered two settings: freezing cold or boiling hot. The windows were also strange as there was no balcony, no screen, and the windows were huge. You could open them and walk right out to your death if you chose.  They also rattled, and let in noise and cold air. We tried to close them better but couldn't.    The beds were ""over made"" with thick, heavy layers of padded blankets which seemed to be made out of plastic, causing us to sweat out gallons all night. I spent most nights on top of the covers as I couldn't stand the weight and lack";3
Your standard nice airport hotel...all the usual amenities...clean comfy rooms...blah blah...but the bar in the hotel, I believe it's called Brewsters? FABULOUS! If you area beer fan, this bar is for you! As far as airport hotel bars are concerned, this bar takes a special interest in craft and worldwide beers. I also had a Ceasar salad which was really good...!!;3
"This is not a typical Four Points Hotel.  So very surprised when I drove up and there was an attendant to valet the car!  Room service ran 24 hours and the restaurant, Brewster's served really good food with a very lively atmosphere.  Worked off all that food at the Fitness Center; it was roomy with plenty of clean maintained equipment.  Its very rare when you go to  hotel and are just blown away with the value for the rate paid. There's no other Four Points Hotel I know that is full service like this one.";5
"If you check in the evening, expect a very long line, and few staff to assist.  And after you've been waiting your turn, you can be sure a bunch of ""gold members"" will shop up, and get to cut in front of you.  Parts of the room were quite shabby bordering on that you can't believe it's still technically a Sheraton.  But the room was clean and comfortable.  The plumbing was spotty, and hard to work the shower, cause there is no on/off switch, and no way I could figure out to control the water temperature.    There is no refrigerator in the room, but you can call, and if available, they will deliver one, but it will be an enormous refrigerator, not a small one.  And it will be right next to your pillow.    Some of the rooms really don't have windows, as the window goes into the";3
Took a room here before 7am flight out (horrible timing, I know...). At 2:30am when packing up, found that the in-room coffee maker only had decaf. This was a little problematic, but the very nice guest services operator sent up the security guard with coffee.  This made things so much better.  Other than that, exactly as expected. Decent property, good service, very convenient.;4
It's in a great location for a layover at LAX or the night before an early AM flight. Convenient shuttle service to the terminals which runs fairly regularly.  The hotel itself is old and in need of overhaul. The room was kind of dingy with old stained carpet, a bed so old it sagged in the middle and a bathroom with dirt/soap scum in every seam or corner.  Bar is great but the breakfast buffet is below standard.  It's not expensive so you get what you pay for.;3
HELLO HOTEL SHOPPERS! In between flights? This property offers excellent customer service, we were in line, when a manager offered water and chocolate chip cookie.  That can ease the pain of long lines. The coffee shop open till 10 pm serves up savory dishes with kind and considerate waiters.  Thank you CAESAR for offering weary travelers a smile😃 Now the below average room with WITH ONE BAR OF SOAP😕 and one waste can, should disturb every guest.  I know that my fellow Travel Advisers are smart savy experience travelers. Please use this review in order to plan your stop over at LAX.;3
I thought this hotel was well kept up and the staff incredibly friendly. The bed was super comfortable and the room a decent size. Only drawback was the internet which was clearly completely overloaded (as it is in most hotels).;4
"We had a one night stopover here and a really late flight out.  Checking in was super fast and easy,  and we took advantage of their day rate offer: paying $40 let us stay till 4pm.  Gold.  The staff were truly lovely: very friendly and approachable and everyone seemed really happy to be there: it created a nice atmosphere.  Housekeeping were singing.  I loved that.  :)   The rooms are not new but ours was immaculately clean.  The bathroom is tiny but adequate for a single night or two, and lots of hot water with good pressure. It's a shower over bath but safe and ok space wise.    The beds were SO comfy that we slept in way longer than we intended and you can black out the room.   The coffee shop was lovely and the Brewster Burger is ""the best ever"" my son tells me.  The";4
I had a flight delayed a day and booked this online with a discount hotel provider while seated at the terminal gate, just having found out the bad news. I had arrived in LAX from Sydney (14 hour flight)and did not want to spend a day waiting at the airport, to see, if, they were able to get us out later that day.  When I asked the Hotel clerk about getting to the hotel, I was delighted that they had a bus that arrived within 15 minutes of my online booking and took me to The Westin, and then to The Four Points.  Within 30 minutes of my delayed flight announcement I was in the lobby of The Four Points. I booked a double bed, but when I arrived the young lady at the counter upgraded me to a King bed, due to availability, no  additional charge! The room was QUIET even though it;5
Staff were wonderful, especially at Brewsters Beererie. Oswaldo and Justin are the best! They were very attentive to everyone in the bar, provided excellent service, and were more than willing to give me advice on some of the great bourbons they had on the shelf. Rooms were a little old and run down with dated furniture, but thankfully the bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. All linens and towels had that really strong industrial chemical smell. Towels were dingy, missing soap and shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were half full and obviously used. The cap on the lotion was partly unscrewed and a long black piece of hair stuck to it. Front desk was very apologetic and sent up more. Great water pressure in the showers, but for a very tall person, I was doing Circque du;3
This hotel needs an overhaul. Carpet stained and sticky. Little spots of who-knows-what splattered all over bathroom ceiling. Beds were comfy but who can sleep when they are Leary of turning out the lights?? Restaurant overpriced and staff inattentive.;2
"First, I'd like to say that the staff went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating.  I have no issues with the staff, the issue is with the facility.  We booked for Thurs-Sun with our tournament and in our confirmation received two queen beds, but was put into a room with two doubles.  It was so small, too small. Suffocating.  Like the inside cabin on a cruise ship with the window to the hallway.  It was old, the beds sagged, the AC could not be adjusted (only a fan), had no dresser, and overall had a very old and in need of renovation feel.  I finally complained and on Sunday we were moved into a ""deluxe"" room, which is like a regular room in every other hotel.  It was normal - nothing special.  I could however adjust the AC.  The TV was very small, but the room had";2
Four Points LAX is one of the three Starwood properties I booked for my Tokyo-LA-Anaheim trip. The hotel is generally clean and comfortable although quite dated. Front desk and bell staff were very friendly and attentive. Check-in was swift (there were only 3 small groups in line, including us). My husband and I were checked into a room in the West Tower, second floor with two queen beds. The room and bathroom were a decent size. The beds were comfortable, pillows ample. The bathroom amenities were motel-standard at best - no toothbrush, no shaver, no showercap, no sanitary bag, no box tissue (had to use toilet paper if I needed tissue). Definitely expected better from a Starwood property. Some suggestions for improvement: 1) To at least provide toothbrushes as standard in;4
When checking in around 3pm I felt like I was bothering the clerk. I had to ask about parking. Dinning options weren't mentioned and info on the comp wifi was also not addressed. I stayed at this hotel because I was considering switching brands now I am rethinking that! The food in the bar and restaurant was the same. I didn't realize there was a regular restaurant until my last night in the hotel. As I said, it was not explained to me at check in. There is a lot of traffic and the airport is really close but none of that noise was too overwhelming. It's the perfect location if you want to be close to airport. The hotel and the rooms were in good shape.;3
Our stay at the Sheraton Four Points was jot a pleasant  experience for us.  The rooms are small, the halls smelt like smoke, the front desk employees lacked the hospitality you would expect  from an SPG hotel. We won't be staying here for our next trip or recommend it to any of our friends and family either.;1
This hotel provides more than just a nights stay - they offer a plethora of amenities including a beautiful lobby, dining, coffee bar, super friendly staff, clean & inviting rooms, and plush beds/pillows.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would choose this hotel if we need accommodations near LAX airport again.  It's just about a mile away from the airport which was easy for us and allowed us more time to enjoy our room before departing.;5
My wife and I spent a night in this hotel not wanting a red eye back to JFK. Our general impression was that it baddly needed an upgrade if it wanted to pretend to be above average. It shows its age. Particularly vexing was the great distance between the check-in and the elevators to the rooms. Also, they claimed that they had free internet flight check-in, but then charged to print the e-tickets out. It shares its shuttle service with the Westin so its was SRO from the terminal to the Westin (first stop).;3
We were on route home from San Diego via LAX and needed a place to stay,,,,called up, they had two rooms left and were more then happy to accommodate us.  we arrived, got checked in with no worries and proceeded to go for supper around the corner, we come back to the hotel bar for a nightcap and we were greeted by 'Nemo' the bartender who served us and convinced my wife to have dessert with her red wine, excellent service by Nemo.  unfortunately in our haste the next day, my wife left her Iphone in the room, once landed back in Timmins, Ontario, Canada: we contacted the hotel to inform them of her phone being left behind.  Thanks to hotel General Manager Peter Kolla and an honest housekeeper Aracely Aguilar, my wifes phone was located and shipped back to us in Canada at no;5
The people behind the front desk were friendly and attentive. Checking in was a breeze. We thought that by booking a Sheraton we would be in an upscale, luxury hotel but it didn't feel like that. It was just standard, not bad but not special either. We looked at other hotel rooms in the area and found them to be generally better. Some were more expensive but included breakfast (Four Points doesn't) and in the case of The Embassy Suites, included a happy hour in the early evening with complimentary snacks and alcohol. Four Points is a bit tight with the room supplies, 1 bar of soap, 1 coffee pod, no pad of paper. There is no fan in the bathroom so mirror gets very steamed up. The shower however was great, very strong stream of water, the exercise room was excellent with a variety;4
"As my duties brought me around Europe the last year, I was not able to visit this wonderful Hotel for more than a year, so I thought it would cost me again a lot of stays and money to rebuilt my former great relation with the Management and Staff, but guess what, even the new appointed General Manager, Peter Kolla and his Sales Manager, Maria Barragan were still remembering me, and as usual they gave me their always warm welcome and full package reservation. Thanks GOD, they are seriously the best ever in business, and of course everybody there is just so accommodating, friendly and truly looking to please you!  I got my upgrade to Jr. Suite and couldn't be more happier with such specious room, perfectly cleaned, styled and well furnished; something you do not expect close to";5
So it doesn't  take a  whole lot to impress me for the most part but I have to say this hotel surprised me on every front ... First off to be greeted by the general manager up check in was a really great touch ... If other hotels want to know how a staff should be ... Then send them to this hotel for training ... These guys do it right !!!!   This is really great property ....;4
I made it to the hotel before 7pm and check in was very fast since my reservation was prepaid. The room it self was clean but, the bath tub had a hair in it and housekeeping took care of it right after I called them about it. The bed was confortable and the coffee maker was durable but, between the bed and dresser, was a bit email. The shower pressure was good. I ate three mini tacos and a non-alcoholic beer and was charged $21 in which I thought was over priced. The buffet was $22.89 for just me and I thought that was too much for one person for a buffet that didnt offer many selections like most buffets do. One positive thing was, the concierge called a massage place for me and they picked me up and dropped me back off. Will I stay again? Yes but, minus the buffet and;3
I was traveling to Los Angeles for a conference and selected the Four Points Sheraton LAX because it was nearby the conference AND they are dog friendly.  I was greeted by the manager Julian Brido and he was exceptional.  Very friendly, accommodating and efficient.  I was impressed by his super positive attitude and, his contagious enthusiasm was reflected by all of his staff.  Every employee I met from the hotel was friendly, helpful and positive.  The Sheraton Four Points is a smaller hotel in the convenient location of LAX but the heart of the hotel is enormous.  For a joyful visit I highly recommend this hotel and their breakfasts are wonderful. Marcia M from Santa Fe;5
I used to stay at the Gateway Sheraton. One time I was unable to get the gov rate so I stayed at this location and like it much better. The staff are great and the hotel is very clean and comfortable.;5
I have stayed at this hotel for at least 4 days each August for the past 14 years as part of a Conference I attend every year.  This was my last stay as our Conference moves to a new property next year. So this review is a final culmination of my time(s) at this hotel.   The rooms have mostly been redone in my time at the 4 Points LAX.  Now at least you can expect a standard Sheraton style room, with a decent bed, still this is a B property at best, will never be the Westin down the street or the Sheraton Gateway.  Check in is always a challenge, over all these years, still challenges with getting people in and out quickly especially as part of a larger group.  Even solo, they seem to have never gotten this down.  The meeting space is fair quality too, and the internet there,;3
This hotel has a 24 hour free shuttle service which is very handy.  The rooms are very old dated and in need of revamping and some TLC.  The windows vibrate and the decor is old dated and tired.  The beds are comfortable, but they are not pillow top as advertised on some websites.  There are ice machines on the room floors which is very handy when having a few drinks in your room.  The restaurant fails dismally and has appalling service and I walked out, the staff in the hotel restaurants and bars are disgraceful and the hotel is need of new staff as these lazy rude staff have no people skills or spirit or interest in their jobs. Time for them to move on as they were terrible.  The hotel is in a very handy proximity to the airport. It serves the purpose for an overnight stay or;3
This hotel is very old and dated and the room windows rattle with the aircraft approaching to land at LAX.  The restaurant and bars have very poor service and the staff that work them need a good kick up the backside.  The rooms are old and dated and need refurbishment. The beds are comfortable and the locations is very handy to the airport with a 24 hour free shuttle service.  This hotel is fine for a night or two but you would gt better value from other hotels in the area.  The pool area is also old, dated and the surrounds need updating and in general the hotel is old and requires a lot of work;3
Went to a conference here, and they went above and beyond. Checked me in early, clean room and great pillows. Every person on the staff seemed to anticipate my needs and tried to help me before i even asked! Will stay here again and recommend highly!;5
I booked the Four Points because I was stranded in LA during the Blizzard of 2015. My expectations were low but from the moment I pulled in, I was very impressed. The staff is right there...personable, friendly and before I knew it I was up in my room.  Even though you can see the planes land from the hotel, it was remarkably quiet. The beds are very comfortable and the room is very well laid out. It's very upscale for Four Points. The only thing they need to do is upgrade the toiletries they provide. They scream MOTEL.  But other than that..I'd definitely book in with them again.;4
Spent the night there and it was restful.  Check in was smooth.  The facility was clean.  The bed was comfortable.    Didn't really interact with staff.  Location is good.  Conveniently located near LAX.  The room was comfortable.  My stay was restful.  There was adequate parking.;4
If you're looking for an overnight location close to LAX then this hotel is perfect. Great food and hundreds of beers to choose from. Nice pool and friendly staff. Tour bus stops very close and reliable.;4
We enjoyed our stay so much! The location is perfect, we had pick up and drop off service, the service was very good. I did some online shopping prior to our arrival and emailed the hotel asking if they provide the service of collecting mail for their customers. The reply was prompt and polite. I got my parcel handed to me on check in! The rooms were spacious and very quiet. We travelled from asiA and needed our rest, we got it plenty. I'm very happy with the stay and will definitely  come back next time we travel to la!;5
I was very pleasantly surprised with this hotel right next to LAX, the service of the staff is excellent, and the room is very clean and quiet.  I was really worried about the noise level from the airport however I was happy to not hear any noise from the airplanes. The only small complaint I have about this place is in the bathroom, I feel they need to do some remodeling and upgrade their tub and shower situation. Also I found the vent for the shower / tub was filthy.  However I would recommend this place and I would stay here again.;4
While this hotel may not be a five star hotel, the service is certainly five star. Staff are very friendly and courteous and they always take extra steps to help, all you need is to ask and they will be very happy to help.  Other than this excellent service, the other reason I stay here is the location. I always fly into Los Angeles and rent a car since no one can get around LA without a car. So here is what I always do, I rent from Budget which is located right across The street from the hotel. If I'm arriving late then I take the shuttle from the airport to the hotel, check-in and called it a day. In the morning I walk across the street and pick up my rental car from budget. No need to waist time waiting for shuttles.  When leaving LA, I check into the hotel at night, drop my;5
This property was just what we needed last week when we arrived to LA.   The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, our room and public areas were very clean, the shuttle was convenient, and we were even given vouchers for breakfast--something we hadn't expected!  In addition, the call center staff was friendly and fun and found a rate that beat anything else I had found for the property. Thanks, Sheraton!;5
James at the restaurant provides excellent customer service. He made us feel welcomed! The people over at the front desk need to be a little bit more friendly they seemed to be a little annoyed at something.;5
We booked into the 4 Seasons LAX as it was a very convenient location. It was a guck stopover stay. The rooms were clean and the staff were very helpful. Car hire is just across the street which is very useful. Only paid $134.00 for the night which was really good;5
"The room was filthy; hair, pretzels on the floor, visible dirt. It also smelled awful, a combination of sweat and cigarettes. Its location is convenient but there are a lot of decent options near the airport. I wouldn't recommend staying here.";1
Good for a quick airport stayover  Rooms are clean and standard. Staff are not overly helpful becuase  the hotel  is so busy but its close to the aiport and they have a shuttle bus going every 15 minutes. We were able to drop our car back at alamo and get back to the hotel easy.;3
Nice room overall. The room was big with nice beds and updated. Though the bureau seemed like it was was around for awhile. One bottle of water was included in the room at no extra cost. The sixth floor was quiet. Free WI-FI was available in the room.  The draw backs were: 1) There was not an in room safe for my computer and iPad. When I went to the front desk, they only had one locking safe big enough for an ultrabook, which was taken. I had to hide my computer in our car when we were not in the room. 2) Also, while they had free Wi-Fi, I could not get it to work with my companies VPN. I never had this experience before, even though the my computer indicated Excellent signal, before signing into the VPN.  If you have a car, reserve parking with the Marriott across the street.;4
The hotel is fantastic in many ways. The employees are excellent in their service and courtesy. Rooms are clean. The restaurant and bar are priced well. The location is excellent. Had a great experience. Rate is excellent, especially if you book online and take advantage of the deals only paid $120 per night.;5
Chose this hotel due the proximity to the airport (only .6 mile but you still need to use the shuttle which runs every 15 minutes). Front desk was efficient but not very friendly. I ate in the hotel bar and the burger was good but huge (could easily share) and the hotel seems to be a popular meeting place (the table next to me was holding a big reunion and there wasn't really a cosy place for me to sit so I took my glass of wine back to my room). My room was spacious and comfortable, The bathroom (with usual overbath but powerful shower) was a little tired but nothing to complain about (although the basin stop didn't work and hand towels are on the rail by the bath while the bath towels are rolled up on a shelf on the opposite wall). The buffet breakfast ($16) was plentiful but;3
Spent one night at this hotel to catch an earlier flight.    For the cost (nearly $200), I was very disappointed.  The rooms are run down and small.  The A/C did not work so the room was too warm to sleep comfortably.  Bath is TINY.    Free shuttle, free wifi, and free water are about the best I can say.  And the staff was very nice.  Will not stay here again.;2
"Stayed one night during a road trip through LA.  Had a difficult time getting a luggage cart and ended up hauling our bags to our room.  Reception offered free breakfast for our trouble but forgot to credit our bill until we asked at checkout.  The room was clean and over sized; should have had a siting area but only had one chair with a couple of stains.  The bathroom needs to be remodeled - the blue tub enamel was chipped, there is no ceiling fan/vent, and the ceiling height is low (if I raised my hand, my wrist would touch the ceiling (I'm 5'8"") standing in the shower).  We charged our parking fee ($21/day) to our room but after checking out and paying the fee, our parking ticket still showed an amount due at the pay gate and we couldn't exit.  Needless to say, a line of cars";3
Selected this one only because of early international flight next morning. The outside and lobby are not bad, but the room is not so good. Was given one of the worst rooms on a low night (based on my guess there were plenty of vacant rooms then). Lots of hotels of various star levels near LAX. Will try a different one next time.;3
Whenever I fly out of LA I always arrange to spend the last evening at the airport's The Four Points. Service is immediate, quality of the accommodations are consistent and the price always affordable. Looking forward to my next trip.;5
I was only credited 1 night when I stayed 2 for my SPG account. I've called this hotel numerous times and left voice mails to accounting, front desk office manager and the GM for the hotel. Nobody cares to return my call and I would never stay at this property again because of their lack of attention to customer service!;2
It was my first Time visiting Los Angeles, me and my girlfriend were celebrating our anniversary and we wanted to go ahead and have a great time in Los Angeles so we went to look online to find a great price on a hotel near Los Angeles airport, this one came through to be on a promotion and even though we got the hotel at a promotional price through my girlfriend's job the person at the front desk that took care of us (Trish Delgado) she could not stop smiling and providing me with that great customer service after we had a really bad day at the airport and on the plane by the flying attendance and every representative throughout the day. She was there to keep our mind positive and to provide the great customer service and she did it. She also heard me mentioning the fact that;5
My partner, our 3 year old and I stayed here in December 2014 and January 2015 and we are very happy with both stays. The 24hr room rate and proximity to airport were major draw cards for us, but we were also very pleasantly surprised to find great food and a fabulous selection of beers on-site. Room service is fast, free wifi is quick and easy to access, rooms and hotel were clean, service was friendly and professional. The free transfers to and from LAX were also important to us. We would definitely stay here again.;5
Location is the best thing about this hotel. The rooms are not up to the  Sheraton quality. During my 3 night stay, I changed rooms 3 times.  This hotel is in need of room renovations.  This was a disappointing stay in Los Angeles.   The first room I was assigned was a distance from the elevators and down a hallway that had an unlit EXIT sign. It seemed  as if the the room was part of another hotel. There was a huge window next to the room door similar to how a drive-up motel is designed. A mildew odor hit me as soon as I entered the room. I requested another room part of the main hotel and without an odor. The second room was closerOK except for the black marks all over the bathroom door.  At this point, I was disappointed. My third request was for a room that was up to the;2
We stayed here for a 1 night stopover before an early morning flight. It had everything you need for 1 night not having to leave the hotel.  We ate downstairs and the food was good.  Service was great, not so much at check in but at the bar they were more than friendly.  Would definitely stay here if you need a clean room, comfy bed, TV and a free shuttle to the airport.;5
This hotel is a great choice right next to LAX. The room was very clean & comfortable, the bar downstairs had a great selection of beers & my burger was pretty good. The staff was also extremely helpful. The location is good if you have to be near the airport but there is nothing really in walking distance other than a Burger King :(;4
For a short one night stay at LAX- it is a perfect hotel. The rooms are comfortable large King size beds and the bathrooms are updated. Pick up and drop off is convenient at LAX. In room coffee makers, iron and hair dryer. Wifi is efficient and free;4
Was a one day trip to LA and the hotel was pretty neat. Had a comfortable stay. The staff was courteous as well. We ordered room service and it was prompt and on time. The bed was comfortable and rooms were extremely spacious.;5
I missed my flight and had to spend an extra night in LAX. As far as last minute reservations go, Four Points was quite easy. I called ahead and did the rest when I walked in. I was given a distressed passenger rate which is lower than their usual price.  The room was a bit of a walk but clean and well appointed. They have 24/7 room service which is handy. Everything worked fine. Only thing I noticed is that the coffee cups are too large to remove from the coffee machine once they are full.  I'd recommend this hotel as a nice place for a quick or prolonged stay in LA.;4
Our 5th floor room had only one window, to the hallway! Not recommended for claustrophobics. Also, bathroom had no extractor.  Our bitter experience was at check out, one short haired man at the reception treated us very rudely. And, in addition, charged us for parking, after we had been told at check in, that it was already included in our prepaid fare.;3
"I feel like the price paid for what I got. Spacious room. Clean. Got a window; room 7 floor. I must said that it was interesting how they number the rooms, odd one side of the hall and pairs to the other side (rooms where lined together but doors were opposite to each other). Difficult to explain. Nothing important. It is that I have not been in a place with this type of room identification system. Bathroom small but clean.   Around 20 dollars for parking. Should be less for guests. Did not care to pay for parking. Free parking close by a fast food restaurant. It was safe. Parking meters on front. From 8 am to 8 pm. Opportunist way for the hotel to charge you for parking. Other reviews are saying that the parking spaces are small so did not care to pay 20 ...  NO CONTINENTAL";4
The room was decent, could use new towels,  kind of dingy but clean. The parking situation isn't ideal ($20 to park on the premises & no street parking). The staff was very courteous and professional. Trish provided EXCELLENT customer service.. Thank you.;4
Overall hotel was exceptional, affordable, and very convieant ! The bar kitchen stays open until 12 45 on a week night. They have a very nice gym too !  And the exceptional customer service provided by Musie was amazing !!!;5
This place is right next to LAX and serves the purpose well. Free shuttle to and from the airport. Then? My room had a window right next to the door. Not good. Feels claustrophobic and no privacy at the same time. People walk along right by your window. You see people but not the outside. There are rooms that don't have this problem... good idea to ask for those.  Parking is $19/night. Feels like a squeeze and not cool. Spaces are tiny. Street parking doesn't look safe.  Neighborhood... I wouldn't choose it, but it's very convenient location for air travelers next to LAX. Breakfast... was actually great. Good memories about their Russian food. Very tasty.;3
"We had an early flight leaving out of LAX and needed a hotel that was close to the airport and wouldn't cost an arm and a leg for a quick overnight stay.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Weird that the lobby smelled of smoke upon entering but it dissipated while waiting to check-in.  It may have been the smokers standing just outside the doors, as their smoke wafted into the lobby.  The room was fairly standard; the bed very comfortable - although the pillows, at least the top one, was too soft.  The bathroom could use a bit of renovating, the tub very old and probably the reason it didn't look very clean. (No problem for me, I carry Clorox Wipes to clean everything anyway.  Don't have OCD but hotel bathrooms give me the creeps.)  Overall, I give it 3-1/2 bubbles, but the rating";3
"What a wonderful experience! My friend and I had two rooms on the ""Club"" floor and enjoyed the amenities. Don't miss the brunch in the restaurant! Staff was friendly, club appetizers and lounge area was great, and service was superb! Also, the van to the airport was easy.";5
The positive and happy attitude of the front desk staff always makes this hotel a very pleasant stay.  I have spent over 30 nights at Four Points by Sheraton LAX and every one has been great. Hotel is clean.  The lobby bar, Brewster's is awesome - friendly and affable staff, quick service and great selection of excellent beers.  The best rooms are in the west tower.  It is the older tower and much quieter.  LAX hotel transportation can be stressful.  All hotel busses just run on a continuous loop and there is no predicting when the next one will arrive though they try to space the busses 20 minutes apart. The Four Points shares a bus with the Westin and it stops at the Westin first - once on the bus and leaving the airport you are no more than 10 minutes from the Four Points.;5
I stayed here back around 2004 and this was the most disgusting hotel I had ever stayed in!  So I was quite reluctant when my meeting was scheduled in their conference facilities for two days.  I'm pleased to report that the hotel has since been refurbished and is MUCH better!  Everything was clean and in good working order.  The public areas were fine, with some signs of wear and tear that you have to look for.    This hotel's real gem lies in the staff.  Everyone was very accommodating, helpful, and friendly.  The rooms were fine for sleeping.  The bathrooms were slightly smallish.    Unfortunately, the wi-fi is highly unreliable in this hotel, with frequently dropped signals (several times per hour), and the need to re-register repeatedly.  Would I return if staying at LAX?;3
This is my second time using the Hotel's Park-N-Fly program and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  The room was clean for the one night and parking for 14 days would be the same as parking somewhere without a room.  Takes the stress out of the traveling situation when you have an early morning flight. I will be using them again for sure.;5
Overnighted at this LAX airport hotel  after a few weeks on the east coast.  We were a family of four and needed two rooms.  The price was very reasonable at $107USD per room.  We booked the night before and the rates were much cheaper than when we were investigating a over night room when we arrived three weeks earlier.  The hotel is walking distance from the Avis drop off and there is a Hungry Jacks accros the road if fast food is your want.  No issues with check in and the staff were pleasant.   They provide you with a buy one get one free beer  voucher per room at a nice bar and there is a pool if you want to cool off.   The rooms are as you would expect for a transit hotel,  small and the basics.  Our two rooms were clean, getting a little tired but overall for a one night;3
Staff where awesome and I couldn't offer enough positive comment on the people there but the room I was in needed a fair bit of work. Bathroom and toilet area was small and the chrome was peeling off the shower fittings in chunks.  I guess I thought Sheraton was up market plus but on this occasion I got it wrong.;3
That´s a great hotel, if you are just making a fligth conection , or staying in Los Angles Confortable room, very silent, with parking area ( US 16,00 ), I choosed the hotel, because it was very close to the airport ( just 10 minutes , and have free transfer to and from the airport ) The staff is great, and have good restaurant., and free wifi Good price also ( US 85,00, with taxes );5
Had the opportunity to bundle the room & parking for our trip to the Mayan Riviera. Property is very close to LAX and numerous eateries. Room was ample, clean and bed was comfy. Parked the car and had no worries for the next 8 days. Hotel personnel was very helpful and friendly. Shuttle service was super and on time. Will stay again with the same package for future trips.;5
We stayed here recently because of a concert we were attending at the Forum.   SInce we didn't spend much time there it was fine.  It's a very busy airport hotel with small rooms.  Rooms are clean but small and you can tell a little older.   I would recommend if you are just coming in for one night but if you are staying a few days, you can find a hotel very close for about same price with larger rooms.;3
You better stay in a montel,  Im serious, this is the worst hotel I have been in United States, the brand dont support anything. The are no custumer service, the rooms needs to be updated and properly cleaned.;2
stayed night b4 our flight back to canada easy check in you can park for free for 30 min to unload rooms are adequate what i liked most was the free shuttle  to airport which is 5 min away price for room was good and hotel is well maintained;4
We went the night before our cruise left. the hotel picked us at the airport and returned us the next day to the gate that Princess picked us at.  The hotel is old but was nice and clean The staff was very nice and friendly.;5
We stayed for one night after a long flight from Sydney to LAX. The hotel has a 24hr check in policy, which is very handy when you arrive in the morning. There is also a free shuttle running from the airport. Check in was quick and the staff very polite. As previous reviews mention the hotel is old and the exterior somewhat rundown, but no more so then the hotels around.  The interior has been updated and is quite nice. We had a very comfortable king bed. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was fine. There was also a bath. My only complaint is there was no in-room safe.   There is a hotel bar and dining downstairs. The sports bar is great - not cheap but no hotel bar ever is.   Overall I wouldn't want to be spending more than a night or two unless you have a car, as;4
I've stayed at this hotel two or three times as I frequently have to stay overnight at LAX.  It's nice enough, although check-in is frequently slow and the lobby is often crowded with slightly sketchy people. They seem to cater to slightly off-beat groups.  Rooms are generally clean and spacious, although bathrooms can be cramped depending on the room.;3
"I stayed at this hotel the week of Thanksgiving ""the best choice."" All the staff was very friendly my sister and I was greeted daily by staff, Patty was awesome in the dining area she provided me breakfast for my birthday. Patty talked with us daily as if she's known us forever and Mussie & staff sent birthday desserts to my room when we arrived from one of our outings it was perfectly placed in the room. Everyone was great to name a few. The other staff told us about places to shop in the area and to be aware of certain things. Everyone was so accomodating. The only reason I didnt rate excellent due to pariking we had to pre pay for parking and there was nowhere to park 2 out of 4 days. The hotel said that was unusal and it never happened but unfortunately it happened to me.";4
This hotel is very old and dated and requires refurbishment. Some websites advertised pillow top beds which is not correct, however the beds are reasonably comfortable. The rooms are old dated and the windows rattle with traffic and aircraft noise when its busy outside. The rooms have a shower over bath which to me is dangerous and very user unfriendly There is a bar fridge and a free airport shuffle which runs 24 hours a day and its very handy. The bars staff in the bars and restaurants are lazy and incompetent and need a kick up the backside or replacing as they are very unfriendly and unwelcoming and couldn't care less if you are there or not. The restaurant manager is very professional and an asset to the hotel and he was very helpful in resolving issues that I experienced;3
I stayed overnight during a 8 hour layover on my way to Hawaii.  I booked online through spg.com, and was given the option to book a flexible rate.  This is great, because you can protect your rate, but if it goes down prior to check in. you can call to get the lower rate.  I did this twice, and got a deluxe room for a great rate - cheaper than the traditional room.  I arranged a late arrival and had no problem at check in.  I found the shuttle stop easily and had a short wait.  The front desk staff (the only people that I spoke to during my short stay) were kind and polite.  Although, the hotel is older, everything was clean.  If I had one complaint, it would be that the water was lukewarm/borderline cold.  It was 11:00 pm, and I had to head back to the airport at 5:30 am, so I;4
The beds get 5 stars. Service was lovely, plenty of hot water, and even though it's a mile from the airport, the room was incredibly quiet😊 we opted to eat in the bar and grill instead of venturing back out into LA. Our car rental return was close too.;5
We only stayed here for 1 day  and only used the hotel as a day room as we had a very late flight out of LAX ,rooms very small and badly need updating  and the bathroom was  tiny . it was ok for the day use but I wouldn't like to stay overnight ,Don't plan on using again . The shuttle to airport was very good;3
Of course it was busy of course there was little parking its thanksgiving in l.a. I've stayed here before and have never had any issues with parking. I come and go to l.a. every other weekend anytime from here on out that I need a hotel I will only stay here. It is the BEST value for your buck. Staff especially Jesus from breakfast buffet, Trish  and another young lady at the front desk were EXTREMELY helpful and represent what a hotel experience should really be like and alot of hotels lack the level of servicemenship that I got from them. I swear I've never felt more satisfied with a hotel and happy with the price too. I love the breakfast buffet it's a little pricey for my liking $18 but the orange juice (fresh squeezed) was worth it. The rooms are modern and clean. The beds;5
Location of hotel and offer of a 'day use room' was recommended to me by another Australian. The shuttle driver s each way were very obliging, lifting cases on and 'settling us into the vehicel. The man at front desk promptly gave us a room even tho it was 8,30am.The bed was comfortable, bathroom good, and very quiet. I enjoyed a quick swim in the pool and found all the staff i passedd on my walk to and fro were very very friendly, eager to help wih anything i needed. The service was excllenet in the restaurant where i had a light lunch. I look forward to staying in the hotel again 'in between flight'.;4
Parking? What parking? Every night you can sleep in your car waiting for someone to leave so you can get their parking spot and head to your room. Towels? What towels? Unless you call and complain there are no clean towels in the room!  This was my first stay at Four Points and I will say its aptly named. It is only worth four points out of 100!;1
Stayed here only for a night before another flight. Staff was friendly and gave the good room without me asking. Room is clean with the very comfy beds and nice view. Room service was fast and tasted great. Breakfast buffet was good with very friendly staff team. Price was quite a little high but worth the good stay. I will surely visit again :);4
I choose this hotel because it is near the Airport, and because the price was good. It is a very busy Hotel, but still my room was quiet. There is also a restaurant inside the Hotel, wich was convenient for me. For the rest, , clean room, friendly staff, good value for the location.;4
Very poor experience. The window looks out on a corridor, the temperature in the room cannot be adjusted, can be adjusted the speed of the noisy fan only, the temperature in the room was high, the sink was cracked. The girl at the the front desk was not gentle. For the dinner i skipped the horrible restaurant that looks like a military refectory with almost no decoration or furniture and I opted to eat something at the bar counter of the Sports Bar named The Brewster. The hamburger i have been served was burnt. The bar tender, very gentle and available, asked me if i wanted to have another one but i declined because it was late and i wanted to go to sleep. In the morning i have been very lucky because i woke up early so I've been able to have a light breakfast (there was not so;2
My husband and I recently stayed here on short notice when returning from a cruise.  The hotel was close to the airport with a convenient shuttle which runs frequently.  The room was clean and comfortable but we did notice some minor street noise since we were on the second floor at the front.  Free wi-fi in the room was very helpful.  It would have been nice to have an in-room safe but this was not included. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  There was a very nice pool area with plenty of seating around it.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying near LAX.;4
Stayed here for 3 nights in a room that faced out the front. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The staff were great and are always there waiting to help no matter what time of day it is. A really nice lady at the check in counter even extended our check out time after I asked if we could store our bags while we went to breakfast because we would be back after check out time. We really appreciated it! Had a really comfortable stay here.  The only downfall is there's a bit of road noise. You do get used to it though. Also would be great If the room had a small fridge. Otherwise very happy.;5
It's been 2 years since I came back to LA specifically to this hotel. My Dad was the one who introduced me to this place and I can't even thank him enough for bringing me to a place where I feel so comfortable. Great staff, spacious room and the proximity to the airport is what i love with this hotel not to mention the car rentals just around every corner. How convenient is that! I look forward to staying at Four Points again whenever i'm in LA!;5
We checked in the early evening as our flight wasn't until the next morning. We drove in from Vegas and planned to meet some family for dinner then return our rental car. Our family decided to meet us at the hotel to have dinner so I told them to just valet their car since it was just for a couple of hours. I didn't know valet parking was $30. After dinner, we said our goodbyes and the valet was kind enough to get the valet charge removed since my family was just there for dinner. He called over the manager (I assumed) and there was a signature and explanation about the valet situation. So I was told the charge would be removed. Checking out the next morning, the front desk didn't go over my charges just asked if I was leaving the charges on my card. I said yes and he quickly;3
When we checked in, we were given a room in the central tower. This room was in the central tower and accessible via a corridor with an outside feeling. The room and the corridor was cold, damp and worn down and you felt like coming to a very (i.e. too) cheap motel. The bed in the room is only a couple of inches from the window facing the corridor so other guests can look down on you when you are in the bed. It is amazing that Sheraton allows such a poor and completely unacceptable standard for their. We complained however and the staff was very friendly and understanding and gave as another room in the East Tower (I got the impression that this was not the first time guests placed in the Central Tower came back with complaints). This room was more like an ordinary hotel room;3
"When my husband and I arrived at the hotel we had been travelling from 0330 that morning from Winnipeg, Canada.  It had been such a long journey and we were exhausted, to say the least.  We were supposed to catch a connecting flight to Melbourne, Australia.  Due to both of us recovering from a virus, we didn't have the energy to continue our journey.  We booked ahead from the airport and when we arrived at the hotel, found that reservations had put us into a different hotel altogether.  At first the reservation clerk advised us that we would have to taxi it to the correct hotel. Then Tyrone stepped in and literally ""saved the day"". I could have jumped the counter and hugged him.  He then cancelled our other hotel and found us a lovely room at your hotel. Gave us a better rate";5
This is an okay hotel with a clean, quiet room, amenities, and a friendly staff.  However it is far from being luxury.  There are few luxury hotels in this area.  Four Points has a van for shuttle to and from the airport to the facility.  It is not exceptional!  I have stayed at better hotels but if you need somewhere safe and close to LAX your money is well spent!  The only thing I did not like is that I had to pay daily parking fees as I had a rental car to use while in Los Angeles.   It is hard to get to other places with one!;3
They upgraded me to a nice room because of my status.  It was clean and quiet.  They had an adequate workout room, free coffee and an excellent Olympic-sized swimming pool  The staff were courteous and the van to the airport was regular and convenient.;4
staff was great. Very friendly and helpful. Room was a good size. Bed was comfortable. Shower was great. Oddly shaped bathroom was small (one person at a time). Dinner & breakfast was good but typically expensive. No good/healthy food options in walking distance. Great location for LAX.;4
When I step to the hotel's door there's a guy at the front desk give us direction about shuttle van, facilities and more. The atmosphere is luxury. The room is pretty clean. There's a bottle of a bottle of water in the room for welcoming. The mattress is  high quality. The shuttle is also on time. It would be better than you expected;5
From the moment we stepped foot on the premises every one of their employees had a smile on their face, making the atmosphere that much better!!! The rooms are absolutely amazing, and owning a property management business myself i know housekeeping can lack in some cases but the room was so clean!!! (only thing i would add is a microwave) The Customer service here was excellent and the employees made sure everything was perfect once arriving, specifically Samantha Sanchez their front desk agent. If i could hire her i would!!! She needs a raise <grin>!!     I will continue to suggest this hotel to all my friends.;5
We have had a great experience, from our check in with the amazing Tyron to dinner in the bar. The food was very good, cocktails well prepared and the staff were super friendly. For an airport hotel I have been pleasantly surprised. The rooms are not great by fine for a nights sleep.;4
Very convenient location from LAX, Budget car rental opposite. With the occasional exception, staff very friendly, helpful and caring. The last 8 stays have all been refurbished rooms, have been upgraded to Jr suite as SPG platinum. Business friend with no SPG status staying in a non-refurb room slightly less happy. The restaurant rather average, but the sports bar, with numerous TV screens, stocks an incredible number of beers, both on tap and bottled, from all over the world. A very good priceworthy hotel for 1-3 nights, for longer stays, I might look elswere;4
We used to stay at the Westin @ LAX but found it to be to expensive for what we were getting. So we changed to the four points on our last 2 trips to LA I'm happy that we did as we feel a lot more at home here. The bar has a lot of beers to choose from & the menu is good to after a long flight in. The room is clean & comfortable the shower has a hard flow of water just what you need after that flight. All in all I'm happy we're staying again on our last night before our trip home. Would recommemd as a great find for an airport hotel.;4
I need to tell you about Jes.  I believe he is concierge title at this hotel.  I didn't stay here, my wife did.  It was her birthday and had to spend it travelling for work.  Sadly, I couldn't be there, so I called and asked Jes if he could do me a favour.  For my wife's birthday, I just wanted to get her a Starbucks Latte delivered to her room in the morning.  We are a simple family that loves our special things, and big presents aren't really our thing.  So receiving her  favourite latte in her room, was an amazing gift for my wife.  Not only did Jess listen carefully to my request, he found  solution and asked his colleagues at work to help out to make this happen.  While Jes was the quarter back of my little surprise, he really couldn't have done it without his team.  From;5
A worn and slightly dirty, close to the airport option.  But it wouldn't be my first pick.  Carpet seemed grungy, furniture a bit old and tatty, and, while the staff was certainly pleasant enough, I felt that the hotel nickel and dimed the guests -- parking was $19.00 overnight, and that's the discounted rate for guests.  Someone asked at the bar to get some hot water for a teabag she had, and they charged her a dollar for a paper cup with hot water.  The internet service was FREE, but VERY spotty in the room.  Hotel shuttle supposedly runs continuously, but I had to wait about 20 minutes for it early Sunday morning.;3
I had a great experience at this hotel,  the staff were very friendly and very obliging to say the least. At check-in Trish was very accommodating with my needs as I was travelling with my sister who requires special needs and Trish gave us a king room which was very comfortable and very clean.  (but, if the room had a fridge, it would be of great usage as I needed to put medication in the fridge and even drinks to keep cold) Miguel, the concierge officer was extremely helpful in getting me to San Diego, Disneyland hassle free and I am extremely appreciative for his assistance.  I would recommend this hotel and I have no problems in staying here again.;5
"Stayed at this hotel for one night as we had a flight from LAX in the early hours of the next day.  I chose this hotel because of the 24 hour check-in/check-cout policy which seemed very convenient for our scheduled flights.  We (a party of three adults and one child) booked two rooms and, according to hotel policies, notified the hotel of our time of arrival 48h in advance by filling out an online form.  Turns out that when we arrived none of our rooms was ready, and even worse, I was informed my reservation was not ""flagged"" for the 24h policy.  After discussing the problem with front desk staff, which was very helpful BTW, my problem was sorted out.  However we had to wait an hour and a half for our room.  We were then offered free breakfast vouchers while we waited and I";3
The hotel is right by LAX.  The price was great.  My assumption was food that was in the hotel would be exorbitant, and more so for alcohol, which would be poor.  ALL WRONG!!  Great brew pub type bar -- local craft brews, well known national craft brews, too.  Reasonable price, decent food, great service for this three generation party.;5
I stayed here for the last month. I like the rooms as long as it is not an adjoining room whre you can hear the noise from the other room. Room ameities are okay, confortable bed, the shower is great with a nice water pressure :). The only one missing is a microwave. I think it is important to have a microwave on every room since the food at the restaurant is not really enticing. Having the same food on the menu every day, becomes old after a week. The staff are nice, courteous. I would like to commend a front desk staff. Her name is Lizette Rodriguez. She went beyond her duties by doing my weekly my reservations, offered some goodies. Other than the comfortable amenities in the Hotel and the rates, I would always come back here just becasue of her. Good work Liz, I hope all the;4
After having  made the trip from Tahiti to Montreal Canada and back each year for the pas 17 years (and therefore passing through LAX twice a year) I have stayed at different hotels (including Crown Plaza, Marriott, Furama...). This has put me in a position to compare prices, personnel, facilities, and I I have chosen to keep coming back to Four Points Lax, for the following reasons.          (1) Your staff, that does not constantly change (which shows that they are also as pleased to work there as I am to stay there) gives you the feeling that you have integrated into 'the family'. From the front desk to the house maids (the only ones that do tend to change, but that is no doubt due to the larger number assigned to the different floors, so I don't get to meet the same ones each;5
Stayed here through getaroom Great for the price I payed  Good service although always busy here has a lot of regulars aircrew etc. Great rooms good shower, good wifi, good tv, good aircon, nice and quiet and great bed. Great airport transfers only a couple of minutes and close to bus stop for transport always taxis out the front Although bus is heaps cheaper  Older hotel done up but does the job for weary travellers. They will also hold your bags for that late shopping before you depart I would definitely stay again Also if you airport transfer its the blue bus as there's s few sheritons;4
This hotel is ok. For a Sheraton I would give it 2 1/2 stars but 3 stars compared to all chains. It's a good place to stay for a night. I can't speak to the value because my company paid for it so I don't know cost. If prices are similar I would go for renaissance or embassy suites right next door. They have van service that runs every 20 minutes or so. We just grab whatever van that drops us nearby. The renaissance van or budget rent a car are real close.     The rooms I would say are passable but they need to renovate in the next year or so to keep or improve upon that status. Everything is just a little worn and dirty, but probably fine for the average guest. I spend a third of my life or more  in hotels so I'm pretty picky.   Heavy spraying of air freshener I assume to cover;3
"This hotel was very creepy. On first entering the lobby, I thought it would be ok, but then when I went up to the 6th floor where my room was, I had to walk through a creepy exit door to get to my hallway, where there was little lighting and huge ugly a/c units along the wall. I did not feel safe walking down this hallway. It was like a motel except inside; the windows of the rooms looked out into the hall. The room itself wasn't horrible, though it was shabby, and the room with the toilet was tiny; when I shut the door I felt a bit claustrophobic. One of the hand towels had a giant string of tangled black hair (I'm blond), and there was a stain on the wall under the full-length mirror. And the water from the sink smelled funny. I will not be staying here again.";2
As a Starwood Preferred guest you get the SPG floor and the accommodations are fairly nice - good space, nice beds but bathrooms are fairly old.  If you stay in the main towers you are in luck, if you stay in the connecting bridge between the two towers its not a pleasant stay.  The rooms are old and after 3 roomc hanges with black mold in the bathroom, the 4th one also had mold.  It was around midnight by then and all I wanted to do was sleep.  The bridge rooms are tiny, musty and ot the carpets are dingy.  Like the main tower rooms but not the bridge rooms.  The restaurant is overpriced but the location is great and the staff is nice.;3
Great hotel if you are travelling from lax   ...   easy going check in and helpful staff   ...  east access to airport  ...  good meals and great breakfast   ...   very quiet rooms when considering location   ...   will stay again;4
Stayed here recently for one night before our late night flight from LAX to Australia. This is no 5 star property but doesn't profess to be. Right from checkin where we were greeted by Balthazar who was superb and answered every stupid question I had with a smile. Offered the $40 7pm late checkout which was eagerly accepted as we had a near midnight departure. Concierge happily gave directions to nearest petrol station and Alamo depot for our hire car. Our room was fine, had a good sized comfortable bed, and suited our needs perfectly. Shower was hot with good water pressure. The only downside was the noisy A/C but it did sound a little like rain on a tin roof so did not impact heavily on sleep. Ate and drank in hotel bar, food was good with good service. Nothing in the local;4
This place needs work! These rooms look like they have stepped right out of the 70's.  They have wall unit AC's and it gives off a very damp and moldy smell.  I found it hard to sleep and breathe and the same time.    The carpet is stained and dirty. The curtains looked like they had not been cleaned in years...I feel so uncomfortable here, that I'm considering checking out early and foregoing the rest of my training.   I ordered room service this morning. I had what I thought was a simple order. omelet with a small pot of coffee and milk.  I received the omelet which had a hair in it, no coffee or milk, plus I received a breakfast burrito that I did not order.  I had to chase down the room service guy to have him come back and pick up what was obviously someone else's order.;2
I travel through LAX frequently and this hotel was the worst. It's an insult to the Sheraton name.  The front desk staff was very professional, but that's all that was positive. We were extremely tired after having had a long day with delayed flights, and another long flight to look forward to the next day-hence why I didn't take time to speak to staff during our short stay.  The room we had needs TLC, the  carpet was stained, furniture was old and worn.  The bath tub drain was filled with hair, so we just washed up using the sink. Sheraton needs to update this property-fast!;1
"After arriving late evening I was able to settle in and order room service - delicious meal and very reasonably priced.   The room and bathroom were spacious, clean and very comfortable.  It also had free wifi! As I was not leaving LA until 10.30 pm the following night, I inquired with reception if I may have a half day booking?  Was advised this would not be a problem - at a cost of $40 - I was able to spend the day in LA for some sightseeing and able to come back to the hotel; shower and change and get the free shuttle back to the airport! Altogether a very happy, friendly and stress free experience - one I have and will continue to recommend to my family and friends! Thank you!";5
I had an early flight and this hotel was located directly across the street from the Budget car rental.  Able to drop off rental car and walk across street.  Staff very friendly, able to check in a few hours early.   The hotel itself looks very business-like. The lobby is functional, no warmth or charm although it does have a large wall of windows that look over the pool area.  The pool area is nice, outdoors in between buildings so provided privacy from the street.  Lots of lounge chairs and tables.  The  pool area was nice.   The room is very small.   It looked like the bathroom had been half updated and not very well.  Subway tiles, average vanity but they didn't redo the yellowed, cracked tub.   Bedding was nice, beds, linens, pillows all comfortable.   Appreciated the free;3
I usually stay at a Hilton property in LAX, but my husband's work required a Sheraton property. This is a much older hotel that has been maintained well enough but is probably due an entire rehab in the near future. The staff is top notch and is the key element bringing updated class to a dated facility. Particularly Tyron Waight who gave us info on the parking, when I was confused and he also added a second complimentary breakfast without even asking. Very attentive & professional.    I arrived after dark before my husband flew in and the parking situation wasn't clear. It turns out there IS valet parking but there's no valet stand and no clear indication of this. I had to park in the back and once again, the signage wasn't clear that there was parking closer to the main;4
Super place to stay. From the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out, I was treated like royalty.  Room was spacious and clean and the bed was to die for! AND, I got it for $100. I will definitely will stay there again!;5
Stayed here for one night as part of a layover  Pros - Cheap prices - It is one of the cheaper 3/3.5-star options near LAX area - Car Parking was convenient (Not free though, think it was $15) - Free internet  Cons - It was just a very sad and depressing decor, with much wear and tear in the rooms, lift lobbies etc. - Small things like visible rust in toilet area, dark and unappealing decor for the room lobby, dirty windows etc - Housekeeping wasn't done too completely, such as ruffled bedsheets, and small water remaining in bathtub - Some aircraft noise can be heard at night, and the garbage truck in the morning - Bath towels were very thin and not comfortable - Rooms on the small size (felt like 25 sqm) - You just feel like you don't want to spend time in the room  I cannot;3
Very basic rooms (right down to the plastic cups to drink from) but the real deal breaker for me was the absolute stink of cigarette smoke in the room and hallway outside.  This is despite the threatening sticker on the bathroom mirror telling guests that any sign of smoking in the rooms will be punished with a $200 fine.  Well, someone was smoking like a champion in my room and the hallway outside and to such an extent that I am still coughing it out of my lungs hours later.  I made comment to the receptionist and I think he took note of it, but if you are promoting yourself as a non-smoking hotel and warning guests about smoking, you should actually follow your own policies and once my room and the near hallway was cleaned and the stink discovered, the room should have been;3
"I do not recommend staying at this hotel. I was in LA for one night on business travel and I purchased a night at this hotel through Expedia. The free shuttle took a half hour to pick a group of us up at the airport. Check-in was very speedy and hotel associates were nice. However, when I got off the elevator, I noticed my room was through a few doors and to the left. I was in a ""tower"" I'm not sure which one because I was there for 5 minutes only. The room was not a normal hotel with a hallway and rooms on each side. In fact, it was more like a motel with an enclose exterior. The long window glasses reminded me of a hotel from a scary movie and the beds were right next to the windows. The room was VERY small and my TV was broken. There were also other stayers smoking weed in";1
Hotel very convenient to LAX, yes. Nice lobby and restaurant area,  I hope for their sake that the rest of the rooms were not as bad as those on the fifth floor of the central tower.  Paper thin walls. Doors slamming, noise carrying all the way down the corridors. Rooms poorly appointed. I was not expecting the luxury of a full Sheraton, but this experience fell far short of expectation.;2
We chose this hotel specifically because it allows you to nominate your check in time if you select the correct room rate ($149US prior to taxes). As we were arriving from Oz at 7am we wanted to go straight to bed rather than hang around waiting for an afternoon check in. We caught the hotel's airport shuttle and were showered and under the covers within an hour of (the very slow task of) clearing US immigration. Hotel was well located, large and had very comfortable queen sized beds. We chose a deluxe two queen room. Bathroom was large. This is not a luxury hotel but ticked all the boxes for location, comfort and convenience. No dramas getting back to the airport early next morning for our onward flight - shuttle runs regularly. If you want to be sure of getting into your room;3
We arrived mid evening after driving from Las Vegas. Check in guy was unfriendly but quick and allocated us our room. The room was in the area of the hotel that looks like it was once a cheap motel. 30 mins after arriving an alarm goes off - we can't get anyone on the phone to find out what it is and eventually a person comes over the loud speaker advising its a false fire alarm and we don't need to evacuate. The alarm continues for the next couple of hours during which time the lifts cannot be used. We go looking for a coffee and are told we can get one at the bar. We wait 10 minutes at the bar with at least 4 staff completely ignoring us - I then ask a guy if we can order and he tells me he is too busy!!!! A girl staff member then comes up and I ask her - she asks me what I;1
Only spent one night here as wanted to break the flight to Philadelphia after 14 hours from Sydney   The reason for booking the hotel was the great 24 hr check in you can do on their website ie if you arriving as I was at 9am you can book a 24 hr time in hotel in advance.so can check out at 9am rather than the hassle or expense of booking two night for a 24hr stay  My two major issues when I checked in at 10 am got told too early for check in advise that I booked the 24 hr check in no apology for his error, and then got given a twin room rather than king room   But apart from that all ok;3
I stayed there for one night on my last trip to LA to catch an early flight. It's really close to the airport with a free airport shuttle. The room was clean and spacious. Friendly staff and good service. Excellent quality for the price. I will definetly stay again.;4
"Perfect location for the price and nice option for a quick overnight when on your way to somewhere else. Rooms were clean and staff was friendly. There is a small coffee shop in the lobby although no real variety for a quick breakfast snack. The restaurant was slammed and they appeared to be ""IN THE WEEDS."" We went next door to the Marriott for the full service Starbucks. They offer 24 hour free airport transportation. The sundry shop is nice and has a wide variety of things including memory cards etc. Their staff is very friendly as well. They offer luggage storage if you want to venture out while waiting and they did one of the best jobs ever of recognizing us as an SPG member. They offer free airport transportation and although they tell you the bus will be clearly marked, it";4
As frequent business traveler I am amazed at the disparity in quality in hotels. This Sheraton has solid, relatively small rooms with good beds. However, they charged me $5.95/15 minute intervals on the Internet or over $24/hr. RIDICULOUS. Parking is $12-17  a day for parking. So it all adds up. But this is not a high end airport stay.;3
I'm always wary of airport hotels because they have a captive audience (travelers) and probably don't need to maintain high standards to attract customers. Who ever stays at an airport hotel purely out of choice?  I was attending a three-day seminar at the hotel and that influenced my decision to stay more than other, more typical factors, such as price, reputation, location to attractions, etc. That said, I truly enjoyed the hotel and my stay, mostly because the staff members were professional, polite, and efficient. Sure, the rooms were a bit outdated and a little worse for wear, but nothing that disrupted my pleasant use of the room. The hotel is very close to the airport but I was never, ever bothered by aircraft noise. My room faced west and afforded a view of the sunset,;4
The hotel located very close to LAX and has a shuttle running every 15 min, so that is very convenient for your travel. The room is nice size. Everything in room is ok except the air vents... the dust is hanging out of those...The worst one is above the sink... I have an allergy, so this dust it was not pleasant... other than that it is a nice airport hotel.;3
I went directly to the hotel after my flight arrived, just after 9:00 am, using their free shuttle service.  Although very early for check-in, they were happy to get me checked-in and settled.  Check-in was a quick and easy process.  The other guest met me there later that day.  Everything was already set up for them before their arrival.    There was a minimal deposit required at check-in.  This was a small percentage based on the total amount paid for your stay.  There is self-parking or valet parking available on the premises.  Each requiring a daily fee, respectively, for the parking space / services.  Be sure to check-in and get a parking card to use during your stay before utilizing their parking.  They were sure to let me know that it would be more expensive to go;5
I feel like I'm the exception based on some of the other reviews I am seeing here.     I arrived late and had an early morning flight at LAX so the location was great.    However when I arrived in my room I was immediately disappointed.   What first caught my attention was the chair at the desk.  The covering at the top was worn completely off and the foam was exposed.   The alarm clock was so dim you could hardly make out the numbers to set the alarm.  So i set the alarm on my phone instead.   Basically the room looked worn out.   So I then headed down to the fitness center to get a run in.  Out of the three treadmills one was broken and the one I used rattled so badly I was afraid the think was going to fall apart.    I'm an SPG Member and have stayed in a lot of Sheratons,;2
We were very tired after a 9 hour flight and one hour getting through passport control, so a 45 minute wait for the free shuttle seemed like forever.  Because the shuttle had taken so long it was packed with people, all talking about how long they waited.  I mentioned the wait to the person who checked me in, but he made excuses and no apology.  The hotel is generic, but the beds were outstanding, with 4 different types of pillows on each bed so you could take your pick.  I like that.    There were several plugs on the desk for our electronics.  I like that too.    After waking up at 4 am I decided to take a soak in the tub while reading.  After 10 minutes the room went black and I had to get out of the tub and feel my way to the light switch in the pitch black.  I got back in;3
Excellent airport hotel.  Good rate.  Very clean room (impressively so).  Dining open until 2 AM.  Convenient airport shuttle service (though the line was so long upon my morning departure that I ended up walking to the terminal).  The good news is that the hotel is so well located I could actually walk to the terminal carrying a suitcase.  I would stay here again.;4
We loved it and would stay again.  It is close to LAX, which we needed. The shuttle to airport was there on time, and we made it to airport quickly.  Very nice pool and pool bar. My husband loved the bathroom, it was in his words eclectic.;5
Stayed here on a quick pass through after a late night flight.  Did not have any issues with the staff, got a quick recommendation for food and got a quiet night's rest.  Staff was pretty good to accommodate the need for a quick check in and we were off the next morning.  Close to the airport and car rental spots.  Recommend to anyone that needs a quick overnight stay.;4
We stayed the night before we flew home out of LAX. Hotel shuttle did great job. Easy to find. Room very clean as usual.  Staff was helpful.  Huge pool heated. I would highly recommend. Thank Jake from Ohio;5
Spent one night at this hotel. Hotel is an older one that is clean and easily accessable at from the freeway and airport. Single king room, was spacious and well appointed. Housekeeping left something to be desired. Two electrical outlets did not work. There were no wash cloths in the bath and only one decaf packet of coffee for the maker. Hotel was quiet and well insulated from the flight path.;3
I arrived late at night and just wanted to get some sleep before my morning connection. The front desk attendant was rude and not understanding. The room was clean and quiet. The food was good in the restaurant. I would recommend it for a one night stay only.;3
In my job, I often stay at airport hotels overnight before going back to work.  My stay here at the Four Points wasn't the greatest due to communication problems between our company and the hotel.  Unfortunately the hotel staff were not very helpful in trying the fix the problem.  Instead of checking us into our rooms whilst the issue was dealt with, they made us sit in the lobby for 2 hours at least.  Then they hadn't even prepared the room assignments properly, so the check-in process was delayed even more.  Since the whole situation wasn't entirely their doing, I can't blame them totally, but they really could've been more helpful in fixing the booking issues and making us comfortable, after many of us had just finished flying from Australia, Asia and South Africa.  Anyway,;3
My company had a three-day event (Friday-Sunday) at this property. Our event management team had worked closely with the sales department to ensure everything was in place to make the event successful. The event management team arrived on Wednesday and found that few of the special provisions that had been requested for the team itself had been correctly executed or accommodated. In light of that, they left very specific instructions to ensure my stay was in order. This included making sure prior to my arrival on Thursday for a stay that included a Monday departure that my room would be billed to our Master Account (and thus I would not have to put a credit card on file since my room and all incidentals would be charged to said account) and that I would have a refrigerator in my;1
Just got finished with a big job and needed some chill time. Rest, pool, chill! I was going to spend big bucks and stay downtown. Instead, picked the Four Points due to the rising cost of my adventure. What a mistake it would have been not to stay here. Never encountered a grumpy or out of sorts employee. All amenities offered from check in to a kind lady at the gift shop that took the time to fold my purchases were executed perfectly. The food and beverage services were outstanding, pool area well cared for and meticulous housekeeping of my room. I used every service I could and thoroughly  enjoyed my 3 day stay. Sure, no roof top pool or wild night club, but most people don't need that. Property General Management can be proud of the environment created as this has passed to;5
No complains for this Hotel, used the day before taking a flight back home. It is close to the airport and most Car rental companies. Food is acceptable too. Even though is not brand new it is conveniently located and have WIFI and shuttle. Some noise coming from being close to the airpor, not too bad.;4
Stayed one night and as my flight out was in the evening my main reason for picking this hotel was for the 24 hour stay. It was much cheaper than booking 2 night somewhere else. I was very happy I picked this hotel. Shuttle to and from LAX was seemless, check in efficient and the room was large, quiet and very clean. As with most places in the US the restaurant meals are lareg in size but tasty. Breakfast was good (includedin my rate), the usual buffet with cereal, toast, pastries and hot food.  There is a small gym and nice pool to relax at (great just before your getting on a 15 hour flight) and business facitites shouldyou need to confirm flights and print boarding passes. Would thoroughly reccommend using the Ocean Express bus if you have some time to kill. $5USD for a round;5
My boss and I come to town and decide to stay here almost every time. He did warn me that if u get a room overlooking the pool, be prepared bc the staff cleaning crew loves to listen to music all night. Right on cue I awoke to Beyoncé at 3am and I called the front desk to ask them to turn it off and they said they will turn down. It's astonishing that a GM will let this happen and will surely impact to stay here again.  If u stay here, don't stay on the side of the hotel with the pool. The staff doesn't care if you need to sleep or not.;2
This is a great hotel for either an overnight stay or multiple nights. U have stayed here when flying out of LAX before, and this time decided to avoid the $350 a night charge to stay in Santa Monica.  For  a 15 minute drive, it is a much better value.  the restaurant and pub are great, the workout room is a good size with free wights and elipticals, the pool is huge with ample chairs, and the service cold not be friendlier.  The rest of the hotel is of good quality as you would expect with Sheraton.;5
Spent a night at this hotel after having problems with my flight. The accommodations are clean and nice, the staff was really helpful and attentive. There's a free shuttle from and to the airport every 20min, so it's a nice place to layover. There's a restaurant attached to the hotel, the food is good and not too expensive.;4
We lucked out!  Took a chance 3-day weekend driving to LA, found hotel on travel site, booked 3 hrs before check-in.  Staff welcoming, friendly, helpful.  Room -excellent, clean, beds comfortable.  Hotel right outside LAX, not luxurious, but we were impressed and happy.  Concierge very helpful when we asked for his opinion on 2 restaurants, which we checked out and enjoyed.  A positive and great weekend.  Thank you Four Points, Sheraton!;5
In my personal opinion, I've yet to find an American hotel that doesn't offer good service (especially in comparison to the UK!), and the Four Points was no exception.  On getting the free shuttle bus to the hotel from LAX - only a 10-minute journey - we checked in mid-evening, where we received a very warm welcome at the check-in desk.  Our room was in the central tower (between the front and back towers of the hotel) which had a sort of 'motel' feel to it, as the room's only window looked out onto the corridor.  Would certainly have preferred a room with a view at the front or back of the hotel, but wasn't phased by this, given it was a one-night stay.  We chose not to eat in the hotel after the large meals on our flight, and instead walked a few minutes to the Burger King;4
We booked this hotel through Expedia and we were not wrong. Great location to move to downtown Los Angeles and neighboring places. Only 500 yards from Avis Car Rental. The room clean, and excellent guest service.  Good and hearty breakfast, good coffee and very nice waiters, good helpful people. Despite being so close to the airport no aircraft noise at night and rest well. The only thing I did not like was paying for parking but because of the fact of staying several nights they made a price reduction. I highly recommend it. Gracias amigos. Alexander Barquero.;5
"We were only here one night to catch an early flight. Very nice staff, you can tell they work hard.  Convenient for car rental return (Budget.)  Shuttle to airport good.  The room's decor is nothing to write home about but functional.  Bed and bedding VERY comfortable!  Bathroom tight and odd layout.  Water pressure in shower good, hubby described it ""like a fire hose!""  Coffee in room was fine.  Appreciated quick delivery of extra towels (wash cloths were missing.)  Wake-up call as requested.  I'd stay here again for the location.";3
I stayed here for business. I did not book my trip.  I arrived late at night. The first room I had was very warm and the in wall ac was very loud. I attempted to sleep but realized between sweating with out covers on and the ac noise that I couldn't sleep. Also the sheets are very thin and do not cover the foot of the bed.  I called customer service and they sent up a guy to take s look at the ac. At first he said the ton was as cool as it would ever get and the noise was normal. He thought the ac was on high... But it was on low and quickly admitted something was wrong after turning it to high. He was very nice and got me a new room.  The next room was cool and quiet. I found in the morning that the shower hot/cold was backwards after waiting a few minutes for the shower to;2
Nice clean rooms. Comfortable beds and convenient location to get around LA and see family. Right off the 405 we were able to zip down to see family in Torrance and run up to Santa Monica for shopping. Has an outside pool. Nice service but nothing fancy-just what we were looking for!;5
We had arrived to the LA Airport vicinity due for departure back to Aussie,after our 5,000 mile road trip.Enquired at a few hotels close to LAX-No Vacancy until we enquired at The Four Points.Accomadation available -so relieved.No disappointment at this wonderful hotel.Firstly at the front desk we were greater by Baltazar Ochoa:)))truly a happy helpful staff member,our book in process was fast and well organised.I would like to thank all staff that helped and attended my husband when he had a medical problem,within minutes staff were in our room to help.Ambulance arrived shortly afterwards,never leave home on OS holidays unless you are insured.Would recommend Four Points,great location,wonderful staff and nice rooms.;5
Overall, I had a very positive experience at Four Points by Sheraton at LAX: 1) Complimentary air conditioned, clean shuttle service from LAX airport to the hotel. 2) Check-in is always a breeze. I requested a couple miscellaneous items from front desk and they provided without any hesitation. They also assisted me with directions to a rental car company. 3) Deluxe king bed room was spacious, cool, and clean. When was the last time you had a big grin on your face after opening your hotel room door? I did yesterday! 4) Some hotels charge $5.00 for a bottle of water but Four Points provides complimentary bottled water for SPG members.  5) Comfy and clean king size bed. I knocked out in minutes. 6) Wednesday's complimentary evening reception for beer tasting and BBQ. [I didn't;5
At the last minute we decided to go to LAX the night before an early morning flight.  We normally stay at the Hilton but they were full so I, with reservation based on some very negative reviews, booked us at the  Four Points by Sheraton and I am very glad that we did.  All the staff were very professional and friendly whether at check-in, the restaurant, the front door or at the bar.  We also parked our car for 10 days at the hotel while out of town.  The room was spotless and very comfortable.  While I understand that one can have a problem at any hotel, some of the reviews were very nasty and I wanted to make sure that I posted a review regarding our experience which was wonderful.  I will definitely stay at the Four Points again on our way out of town.;5
I booked this hotel as part of a award booking to cover an overnight stay after a long JFK flight.  I had fairly low expectations because I haven't had a pleasant 4 points stay in the past (the decor is much worse than a typical Courtyard by Marriott or Fairfield Inn) and because it was an airport hotel which gets a lot of traffic.  I waited and waited and waited for the shuttle. After about 40 minutes, they showed up. No apology for being late or slow as they were just going thru the motions.  Once I arrived, I was greeted and provided the usual amenities associated with Platinum (sans an upgrade). I perused the bar which had a mindblowingly good craft beer selection. If anything the bar really is the standout.    After a drink and a pleasant conversation with the bartender, I;3
hi me again industry traveller so honest reviews ,I was less than amused on arrival the hotel was dated , dirty and scruffy the staff were also scruffy in dress no real passion for the product . The food was awful and cold . We only choose it for location to the car rental we collected the following day before we left on a toad trip. The pool is very small and overlooked by the reception not the nicest position all in all there are plenty of better hotels give this a miss......;2
I recently stayed at this hotel with my children while on vacation and had a great time.  The rooms were clean, the staff was so pleasant and helpful, and it had all of the conveniences that we needed,  We originally planned on staying at the hotel only for two days and then were moving closer to the coast but we had such a great experience that we decided to stay at this hotel for the entire 8 days we were in LA.  The location of this hotel made it easy to get everywhere that we wanted to go.  The restaurant, bar and pool bar were great.  Loved the food, drinks and the service.;5
The service at this hotel was wonderful.  The atmosphere is great.  The rooms were small but clean.  With that said, this place NEEDS to be updated.  The low ceilings, old aging furniture, and aged decor in the room make this a pleasant place to stay for a 1 or 2 night stay, but not for any length of time longer than that. The doors to the room are VERY thin and we often thought that other people were opening our door because it was so loud to the left, right, and across from us when they were opening their door.  This was an issue during the evening as well.  Both restaurants were wonderful.  Paid parking is outside not in a lot particularly secured.  Overall, good for passing through.;3
Staff was nice and sharp.  Rooms as good as other Starwood in area.  Easy to get in and out.  Pool bar, great new addition.  Restaurant was also solid.  Even lower rooms not loud that close to LAX.  Have stayed at other Starwoods in area and will put this one at top.;4
The service was very good easy pick up to LAX airport , nice pool check in was very easy rooms very clean , close to shopping centre , just really a 1 night hotel  great access to shopping , shuttle runs 24 hours a day every 20 minutes so easy .;4
The hotel is located very near to the airport. Good for people who needs to catch an early flight in the morning. Staff are very welcoming and the hotel room is quite spacious. But food is not too good in the cafe and not many variety.;3
Have stayed here few times. Never disappoints. Staff friendly, great location with free shuttle available. Wifi free as well Rental cars across the road. Highly recommended. If you looking for a clean place near airport then this is the place for you. Late check out available on request.;5
We were leaving at 5am for the airport and we were given a room next to the ice machine and elevators, we asked for a different room and they were very nice and gave us a great room.  Everyone was friendly and super nice.  The only thing I didn't like was that we would have had to pay to use the internet to print out boarding passes in the lobby.  It was free internet throughout the hotel and it worked great!!!  This is the kicker... I forgot my Kindle at the hotel...they called me to tell me they found it and would ship it back home to Michigan for me...I was very impressed.  I paid for shipping and it arrived wrapped in bubble wrap and extra paper...I will be staying at this hotel every time I am in LA!!!  Thank you Sheraton Four Points!!!!!!!;5
This hotel is a comfortable distance from the international airport LAX.  Although it offers all of the standard amenities you would expect from a decent chain hotel, don't expect luxury or anything out of the ordinary at this place.  The building and grounds look like they were last renovated about 30 years ago, but everything does work, in spite of being fairly ugly.  If you happen to stay at this place, do NOT order room service.  First of all, they don't have many vegan options on the menu. Second, if you fall in to the trap that I fell into, you will end up paying a fortune (e.g. I had a bowl of bad chili + a Budweiser and the bill--once they included tax, tip and a surcharge for room service--was close to $30. Incredible.  The breakfast in the hotel was just as bad: None;3
I felt like home at this hotel. Basic comfortable rooms and bathrooms but it was everything else that stands out for me, such as the restaurant downstairs that offers value for money and yummy food. The service by Jesus was brilliant, nothing was too much trouble. The gym was excellent with a water machine to top up my drink bottle and a self help laundry. The best value was the 24 hour stay so if you arrive late you leave late no extra charge, you must give a 48hr notice for this. I will be back and stay longer. very rested and good service to the airport by bus, Thank you;5
This hotel was expensive but I got a good rate for one night only at hotels.com. Parking and buffet breakfast were not included in fee. Was not very impress with the décor of room, bathroom was very small (not comfortable and bedding seem old and overused). Parking was very tight and almost no spaces left for parking. Would not be staying there again specially since it was as expensive as other hotels in the area. Thought Sheraton association would make it a great hotel.;3
Stayed here for one night on my arrival to LA as my hotel in Burbank wasn't available yet.  Service and staff were all great, room was a bit dated but nothing major.  It was clean, beds were extremely comfortable and the wifi connection is excellent.  The onsite sports bar Brewster is a must do here. They have the most impressive beer selection from around the world and the overall atmosphere is great. As a woman travelling alone I would not hesitate to stay here again.;4
We stayed here with our two kids for 2 nights before flying out internationally. I had previously stayed at the Westin and wished I spent the extra this time also. Room was sub-standard and in need of a renovation. We had arrived early and our room wasn't ready yet so the staff were very helpful and gave us a voucher to enjoy the buffet breakfast. We have stayed at worse around LAX!;3
Carpet in room had several stains and bathrooms don't have much of a venting system so sweating after showering was an issue.  Beds were comfy!  Bar was comfortable but dining room was so uninviting I felt sorry for the hostess and waiter.  Needs help!;3
"The rooms are very nice, and the pool is lovely, but the people working here made it the best experience for us. Our young one forgot his teddy bear. We discovered Bear was missing while checking in for an international flight.  A frantic phone call to the Sheraton Four Points left us all feeling much better.  Adam at the front desk sent a ""search party"" in for Bear, and then sent us an email letting us know that Bear was found.  He even offered to send Bear to the airport via shuttle so that we could claim him before our trip began. Way above and beyond!";5
Paid $245 on Expedia for the worst room ever!  Clearly the cosmetic paint job that covered up all the rusted areas did not do the trick.  Old and outdated doesn't begin to cover it.  Dirty grout in the bathroom, old towels, all doors painted over 15 plus times, nothing made of WOOD....and this was the second room!  Was moved from the first room because I didn't want to be in the outside hall in the dungeon which was accessed through the EXIT door, pasted the outside coke machine and down the hall.  No business center, only 2 computers in the main lobby, both of which never worked.  Could not print a boarding pass.  Spare yourself the misery!;1
This hotel was inexpensive for one night - the front desk was not helpful in fact they told me my cc had declined and I asked to use a phone / the women was rude left the desk and was not around when the cc company told me she never ran the card - I had to flag down a restaurant manager because no one was at front desk - 10 min later a manager came out - got in our room eventually. The food was gross - all the dressings are made with flour and mayo - drowning in dressing with rubber chicken or dry rubber salmon - the west tower faces car lot - very noisy and as a perk the window is not sealed allowing airport fumes to leak in room - that along with paper thin walls makes for a less than great time :) go across street!!;2
So I was going to LA for college and needed to check in for an overnight stay after the flight. I found this hotel and tried to make a reservation, but they won't even let me make a reservation and said you can't reserve/check in if you're less than 21. As far as I'm aware, 18 is the legal age of majority, when you can possess a credit card, a driving license etc. Yet to stay here you have to be 21. Outrageous.;1
This hotel is by far, the worst hotel I have every stayed in! It is a motel (and not a very good one at that!) in disguise. The room was dirty, the carpet frayed, I could feel the springs along the sides of the bed, the toilet/tub area was small and the sink was outside of the bathroom area with no door. The staff was not helpful. The free airport shuttle took so long to come (we waited for 55 minutes)  that we caught a cab ($19 even though it is only 1.1 miles from the hotel. Driver said and receipt showed there is an automatic $14 charge for air port hotels.) When I and another guest complained about the shuttle service, the manager was unsympathetic. The hall reeked of marijuana (although I guess it is legal in Los Angeles) and there was a soda machine in the hall with no;1
We spent three nights at Four Points. Nice and clean room and bathroom. W-Lan is for free but a bit slow at the room - better at the lobby. Parking is expensive but there are two cheaper parkings near the hotel. Attentive service. Air traffic doesn't bother us.;4
We had an event at a hotel next door and only needed the room to get a good nights rest.  We were upgraded to a suite on the 14th floor, the room was very nice and spacious.  It had a nice view of the Airport and overlooked the swimming pool.  We returned from our event at 11pm Saturday night exhausted and eager to get some sleep.  Unfortunately the people in the room next to us were eager to party.  I had to call down to the front desk 3 times between the hours of 12am and 4am before they finally stopped.  My question is, why would it take that many trips from Security?  There needs to be a better policy in place.  We are travelling with 2 small children and they didn't need to the loud noises and bad language coming from next door.  I think the hotel needs to review and revise;4
Stayed one night at Four Points.  PROS Location was nice: near airport and bus stops are nearby (< 5 mins within walking distance), which can be important for public transportation lovers. The area did not appear particularly dangerous. WIFI was fast and strong. Pool was next to the lobby and looked okay (we did not have time to enjoy). Shuttle service to/from airport was frequent and prompt.  CONS The hotel is a bit motel-ish in the structure. Room was not really impressive and I would not stay for a very long time in the room. Noise from the neighboring rooms was very loud. There was no plane noise, however. Having paid $120/night, I felt I might have overpayed, though it was less than elsewhere in the area.;3
Stay for 4 nights. First was no problem, second morning went out into hotel parking lot and discovered rental car back window smashed... Security said they would review video, contact me in a week and talk to insurance company. Two weeks later.... no contact. Air conditioner broke in room third night had to move at 10pm.  Was clean, decent beds, no hot tub, 16.00 or breakfast buffet...  For the money next time I will stay somewhere else.;2
Spent the night at this hotel since my friend was going to be staying overnight after a long trip from Manila. The room was cramp, carpet all over the hotel was soiled & faded, hallways & rooms were smelly. Such a disappointment since my expectation was more because of the Sheraton name. Never again!!;2
The Hotel is very nice.  The entire Staff is knowledgable & friendly.  Everyone from Housekeeping to Guest Services to Management took great care in working to ensure I had an enjoyable stay:)  The Staff was very accommodating and courteous.;5
The name of the hotel suggests a certain quality. With that in mind it's disappointing. Initially the room (2 doubles) would cost us $168 but we were able to use a specific discount code and paid $89 per night. Room is not worth a penny more. Rooms size is okay, bathroom pretty small, furniture is worn and needs replaced. Fridge but no microwave. Beds are wonderful!  Coffee, tea and bottled water complimentary but the water was no where to be found. Had to call for it each day. Cleanliness bathroom not the greatest. Rust stains in tub, yellowish water from the shower and no room to leave shampoos.  Parking is an additional $19 per day, breakfast is not included.  Elevators are very scary. Go slow and bounce a lot with noises of the cables. Other guests were commenting on it as;3
From the moment we stepped into the pokey entrance this hotel was a disappointment.  The horrid brown carpets in the corridors to the rooms looks like it has seen better times.  The room was small, very basic, the air conditioning was freezing, although stinking hot and humid outside it was just too cold. Only option was to turn it off, which we did. Apart from small the bathroom was awkward to move in. Basic amenities, using the shower meant hot= cold water and cold= hot water (which took 20 minutes to work out).  For this price there is sure to be a better option!;2
Hands down winner of worst hotel I have stayed in at this price point. Fact. For $250 US for the night and the Sheraton name on the place, I expected a whole lot better. This place also wins the award for worst food I have ever had via in room dining. I have stayed in places all over North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and this was the worst food (I am only speaking about places in the same price range....but then again I actually think that it was still the worst food over all) How do you you make a pizza so bad that an overweight, junk food loving, 35 year old male cannot even eat it??? Calamari that were fried in old rancid oil??? For gods sake....even the water stunk. The room itself was old, dirty and stained. Old tape around the door handles from painting and the;1
Acceptable experience for the weary traveller wanting to stay connected to the airport.   Comfortable bed!  Free airport shuttle. Free wifi. Good outdoor Swimming pool. City Bus nearby will connect you to a few shopping areas, Farmers'Market and Hollywood....though can be a slow trip.  Aircraft noise...but you wanted to be near the airport!  Friendly and courteous front-desk staff, always.  VERY dirty windows however!  AND...possibly the worst pastry I have ever eaten ( anywhere!) at the coffee/snack bar along from reception (right of reception). Like biting into congealed fat! Truly revolting and inedible. I should have complained but merely discarded into a bin. ( Four Points Sheraton LAX International Hotel.  needs to find a new supplier!) Better choices of less fatty;3
I recently stayed yet again at the Fiur Points Sheraton , LAX..... For 2 non-consecutive nights... On arrival for my first stay I got to check in at about 0740 and was ever so politely greeted by the extra personable Juan.... He has true empathy with the guest... I asked for an early check in BUT never expect. Juan said he would let me know as soon as my room was ready.... So I waited in the reception area. By just prior to 0900 Juan  called to me and personally let me know my room was ready. I was SO grateful.... My second stay was 2 days later and again I was greeted by Juan.... This time about 1400 in the afternoon... Well it was just like coming home.... Juan said he had been waitin for me and that me room was ready...  It was a much larger room in a sper quiet position away;4
"One of the main reasons I picked this hotel was because of its ""24 hr checkin/ checkout at no extra charge "" option .Just book as normal and then let them know at least 48 hrs before of actual check in times..there is a form to be filled out. It worked out great, because I had a flight leaving at 11.35pm. I checked in the previous evening at 7.30pm and had until 7.30pm the next night . Didn't have that stress of having to check out by 12pm. It was close to the airport and had a free shuttle . You stand at one of those pick up points , but keep an eye out , because they swing by quite quickly and if you miss them, it's a while before the next shuttle comes. There are two different shuttles, one going to Sheraton Four Points and the other going to Sheraton Gateway, which is also";4
We stayed at this hotel for 1 night and it was great! The hotel was clean and we felt welcomed at this hotel. It was close to the airport and there was a free shuttle from LAX so it was good. We arrived late at night and we had no food so we just walked to a convenient burger king right by us and it was good. I would recommend this hotel.;4
I travel to L.A. about a half dozen times a year and over the years this has become my go-to hotel.  I love staying there and I personally find it very comfortable. They've made a lot of improvements recently and it shows, both in the rooms and the common areas.   The front desk and bar staff are top notch.   There's a car rental desk right there in the hotel which I've used a few times and is majorly convenient. Bathroom amenities are good and towels are plentiful.  I read some of the other reviews on here and have to agree with the positives and note that most of the negatives are problems you would find really at any random hotel.   I've never had a problem there having any request fulfilled.;5
We stayed last month at the Four Points by Sheraton because we needed to be centrally located and the price was right.  This is an older property that has been updated but the bathrooms are still really dated.  Our biggest problem with this location was that the parking was a major issue.  Two different nights, we had to park down the street at the Marriott because there was no more spaces left at the hotel we were paying to stay at!  We had to pay for our parking at the Marriott then deal with trying to get reimbursed from the Four Points.  The whole process was irritating and very inconvenient, especially when coming back late in the evening.  Another issue we had was with the noise at the pool.  If there were quiet hours or pool hourse, the hotel didn't enforce them.  On;2
We used this hotel because it has a policy for late check in and late check out if they are notified at least 48 hours prior.  This is convenient if you are going to have a flight leaving late at night. Our room was in the main tower and when we arrived we were very, very tired from traveling from the southern hemisphere…too tired to complain …and leaving the next A M …but…there was mold at bathtub edge and floor needed a good scrubbing …both with bleach! Price wasn't bad for a night, but, at any price….one shouldn't have to see that someone did not take time to spritz a little bleach around tub.  Staff at desk was cordial.  Brewsters bar has a huge selection of beers.  Food in there was pretty good, however, took awhile to get waited on. Not sure if I would stay here again.;3
We needed overnight accommodation for a family of 4.  We were in the hotel for less than 12 hours while carrying on to the east coast.  Other hotels were significantly more expensive.  Property was better than we expected based on the price.  The shares Westin/Four Points bus arrived within minutes of us arriving kerbside.  Rooms were clean and tidy and beds (the most important thing) were very comfortable.  The shuttle bus left on time the following morning.  Thanks for a hassle free easy stay at a very economical price;4
Good hotel with helpfull staff, the wifi could be better, seens we were working while we were staying at the hotel!  Good beer selection, with beers from all over the world, Nice rooms, clean and comfy beds, easy to bring a car, seens the hotel has a parking for 19.90 $ a day!;5
Needed to stay at a hotel near LAX as our plane home left late next day. Went onto booking sights and saw Sheraton Four Points. Price looked good at $146 + Tax and I thought the brand name would mean a good experience. Some of the other hotels wanted $199 + tax. Didn't start well when the pick up bus left without us. Waited another 25 minutes before they came around again.  The concierge staff were talking amongst themselves alot and weren't as attentive as better run hotels. On check in I waited for a while even though one of the check in staff wasn't doing anything. Room was basic and comfortable but was noisy from the street traffic. I think it would have been better to get a room on the inside of the hotel overlooking the pool, not facing the street.   I needed help to find;3
If you need a place to stay the night before you depart LAX, this is the place.  If you're dropping off a rental car, it's right down the road from Hertz and Avis (1/2 mile away), and across the street from Budget, so you can drop a car and walk back to hotel.  When checking in, you can park your car out front and go check in, without being hassled by valet parkers (like some nearby hotels do).  Other good points: 1. Free internet, free bottled water, and micro fridge in room - many nearby hotels charge you for water and charge $13/day for internet 2. Reasonable prices for a good room ~ $100/night, and rooms are quiet and comfortable, with plenty of space 3. Good shuttle bus service to LAX - frequent and fast 4. Free USA Today newspapers (and plentiful, whereas some hotels run;4
"Decided to get away for the weekend, but my family and I didn't want to travel too far. We found a deal through a discounted website and were quite pleased to book a room at the Four Points by Sheraton. After all, Sheraton is highly reputable in the hotel industry. Upon checking in, we were told we would need to pay $20 just to park our vehicle on their premises. Really? Fine, so we did. The room itself is nothing special; it was rather plain. The bed was uncomfortable and clearly worn. It felt like it was sinking inward. On the plus side, the pool was well-maintained and there were freshly cleaned towels ready and available for you near the pool entrance.   All in all though, I don't see my family and I ever coming back to this establishment.";2
"I am very pleased and happy to recognize the amazing staff at the Four Points LAX; Angel(I believe the manager) and Elena (Check in lady)  were beyond helpful and were am willing to go above and beyond to meet the client's needs. hotel room wise, everything is clean and tidy, exactly what'd you'd expect out of a hotel.";5
If you're looking for just a place to lay your head for the night during an airport layover, I guess the Four Points is OK.  The airport shuttle takes you there in just a few minutes, so it is very convenient to LAX.  It's dark, a bit dingy, but cheap.;3
The location of the hotel is very convenient if one is traveling through LAX. The hotel room was spacious with comfortable beds. The customer service from the front desk and other staff was good. The hotel is much bigger than what we thought. The breakfast is usual fare but I liked it better than other places.  The area surrounding the hotel is not exactly great neighborhood. It wasn't a problem for us but I won't recommend someone to go out for an evening walk.  Overall we had a comfortable stay and found the hotel to be good value for money.;5
"Pros:  Location is very close to LAX, easy in and out.  Fantastic beer selection and one of the nicest hotel bars I've been to.  I'm not the only one who feels that way as I talked to several other travelers who appear to be ""regulars"" here.  The bar area was crowded.  Staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Rooms are clean and adequate.  Cons:  It's an older hotel which has been remodeled but you can still feel the age.  There is a $19/night parking charge to be aware of.  The food is just okay.  The area is sketchy so you don't want to be taking any late-night strolls.";4
Had to book a hotel for our family of 4 on the fly after missing a flight out of LAX. Hotel was close and provided a free shuttle. Check-in was smooth and fast. The pool was lovely and provided a bit of light relief from a stressful day. Beds comfortable. Room was a little noisy when people were in the corridor but for one night this didn't bother us. Shuttle got us back to the airport quickly and easily. For our needs we were happy with this hotel.;4
Came to LA on a last minute business trip on June 19th, just needed to stay overnight so wanted to stay close to LAX.  Arrived at Four Points Sheraton not knowing what to expect.  The service I received from front desk advisor TYRON WAIGHT far exceeded my expectations.  He was able to put me in a terrific room at a fantastic rate, and also answered several other questions I had about the hotel and the area. The hotel itself has just about every amenity a traveler needs (except a 'high-end' fancy restaurant if that's a must have for you),  decent pool, couple of bars, onsite car rental, several conference rooms, and a pretty decent bar/sports bar with food that surprised me.  I'm pretty critical when it comes to food, and I didn't mind eating here for convenience at all.  In;5
Everything I wanted in a hotel for the most part. Just a little limited in food choice though. I wanted smoothies but no such thing. The hotel is perfect for a working vacation that I had. Could work poolside, at the lobby, etc. It could have been a little cooler at the lobby but it wasnt bad and I loved the lobby overall to relax, or work from;4
A delayed flight into LAX landed at midnight. While waiting at baggage claim I called and asked if their were rooms available, the woman on the phone Cindy, was very nice & held a room for us. Once we arrived at the hotel we were told there was a $19 parking charge, which I completely forgot to ask about & my husband and I were caught off guard by. The gentleman behind the counter checking us in discounted the parking to $12, and asked if we wanted late check out, we asked if there would be an additional charge & he said no. We were so grateful for this, late check out was 2pm and we needed ever minute of sleep. Once we got up we were able to order room service, which was just perfectly convenient. The hotel seemed great all in all. Employees were friendly & the beds were;4
The lobby was pretty and everything was easy to find, the elevators, front desk was down the hall into the entrance and the restaurant was to the left. Parking was pricey and was outside, tight parking spaces. The pool was heated and clean with cabanas open for use and towels ready for guests go use. Disability mobility was available for the pool. The room was clean, had sufficient space to put away belongings, cute quirky hand soaps in the bathroom and an updated toilet which I haven't seen in other hotels. Free water and coffee was available in the room and a variety of channels to browse in tv. I picked this hotel mostly for the availability of the airport shuttle that runs 24hrs and affordability. I would choose again. They also had a lot to offer in terms of dining and;4
We had an overnight layover at LAX and just needed a Place to catch some shut eye and a decent breakfast.  We waited about 10 minutes for a shuttle at the airport and check in was quick and friendly.  The room was clean and pleasant.  The beds are why we stay at SPG properties.  Soooo comfortable!  Breakfast was OK and the shuttle ride back was uneventful.  Overall very good stay.;4
Upon arrival I was greeted at the front desk.  We were given directions to find our room.  Room was very clean and had a lot of open space.  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and the food was delicious and the staff was extremely helpful.;5
Room is clean and spacious, but the bathroom was very small and the tub was stained.  Staff very friendly and the breakfast buffet was very good.  Hotel is pet friendly and there was plenty of green grass areas to go for a walk. Nice pool and work out room.  Plenty of restaurants near by and shopping.  I would recommend this hotel.;4
I have stayed at many other hotels near LAX due to my business travel needs. I came upon this hotel by accident and have stayed there each time since then. They just happened to have rooms avail and no one did when I needed it. Since then I have been 10 or so times and never once have I had an issue with check in or out and any of the staff. Everyone is friendly and seems to want to make your stay pleasant. The pool is a nice plus for a quick dip and the bar / resurant has wonderful food. I will be back for sure. Thank you;5
The Four Points a LAX has by far exceeded my expectation during my last visit. This hotel has one of the cleanest lobbies of any hotel near LAX, a wonderful private pool with bar, and a hotel side bar with a very good beer selection. Rooms are comfortable, quiet (especially for an airport location), and they provide extra bathroom supplies. Parking is simple, but can get crowded late at night. You will not be disappointed with the friendly staff throughout your stay. Having stayed at several LAX hotels for the last 15 years, I must say that I have found a new favorite.;5
Stayed for one night. Room was clean. Staff were polite. Use park and fly if leaving from LAX.They have three packages which are 5,7 and 14 day. There are a couple of places to get a quick bite before taking the shuttle to the airport.;3
Stayed overnight after a long flight and it was ok.handy from airport with shuttle bus transfer. SPeedy  check in and good bar food which was well presented and quick to arrive. No breakfast in our deal and had coffee from Starbucks in hotel lobby.;4
Think twice before staying at this property. The valet service guys are rude and verbally assaulting. My experience at this property has been very positive the first few times I stayed there but. This last visit will be my last visit. I complained about the verbal assault to the valet manager and he did not do anything to resolve the issue. As far as I could see he never even spoke to his employee about the situation. I was never contacted by hotel management either. I left them a poor review on their hotel survey and still no communication back from them. I would not recommend this property to anyone.;1
First let me start by saying that we usually stay at the Sheraton Gateway which is also right next to LAX but when booking this time I blanked out and booked Sheraton Four Points at LAX instead.  The room cost was much higher than what I've paid at the Sheraton Gateway which is odd because the Gateway is actually a bit higher rated than the Four points on other travel websites and Trip Advisor.    I thought the lobby was welcoming and attrative and check in staff were very nice.  The lobby has several large TV's and areas for sitting and lounging.  I noticed that in general the staff was very helpful and customer service oriented.  I didn't try out the pool but was told that it was heated and there was a pool bar and cafe.  I stayed on the SPG (sheraton loyalty member) floor.;3
When you choose an airport hotel you need very specific things. Good location, to be comfortable, clean, to have an easy to access parking lot and an early and complete breakfast. This hotel fails in multiple categories. It is old, the parking lot is a mess, same as the breakfast. But the thing that really bother me was the cleanliness. I found multiple black hairs in the bathroom (I don't have black hair), the carpet was wet and smelly, towels were really thin from the multiple uses. Just avoid it as I will. I'm actually avoiding the whole chain of hotels.;2
Ok my night he was good without problems and the staff was not that friendly.. it felt cold and so bad.. i think that it can be worked out with more service practices.. i used to work for Trump Tower in Panama city.. a Mistery Shopper trained us for anticipating guest needs..   If a Maneger sees this masege please dont go rough on the employees.. they only need trainning   Best wishes to all!;2
other then someone working in the room we had been given ,,it was a good time ,and we ere in the room kicking back when he entered  with no worning to finish the work but he had no clue we were their,,,other then  that what can I say.......;4
After spending more than 50 nights a year in hotel rooms I thought I had seen it all but this hotel set a new low.  I was booked here by the concierge at the Westin LAX because my early check-in room there was not available and, according to them, the Four Points Hotel had rooms ready “now”. “Now” turned out to mean later that day but the desk clerk  found me a room in about an hour. (He also told me that they don't have any housekeeping staff working before 9:00am which would be a new first for an airport hotel!)  I climbed into bed to get some sleep after my 14 hour flight and was woken by a gurgling noise in the bathroom. I tried to ignore it but eventually got up to find the bathroom floor covered in numerous spot of water and the bath full of what looked like effluent.  The;2
The worst experience in my life, a poor quality, bad customer service, and the parking lot is extremely small so I can't not find a place to park my truck and they told me they don't have any spot for handicap guests.;1
Upon arrival to our room the hallway itself smells like pot/smoke, the room is so tiny especially the bathroom can't breath. Staff is not accomodating, there is one time that I advised them that my mom will be coming to visit me, just In case she arrives  and I'm still out on tour, to let her in our room, the staff said he could definitely do that, but it didn't happen, they let my mom wAit for me at the lobby. That's unacceptable.  Then you have to pay for your parking which is quite expensive but no space to park! I will definitely not recommend this hotel, if I were you I'll just go to nearby hotel, for additional fee you'll feel accommodated!;2
We tried their special fly/park offer, but the experience was so negative that we'll take a taxi to the airport in the future. Every room we were shown reeked of stale cigarette smoke, as did the hallways. The staff was rude and the breakfast was expensive. It's not worth the free parking and shuttle service to begin one's trip under these paltry conditions. Definitely not recommended.;2
This hotel is okay for a very very short stay.  The entire hotel smells old and moldy.  The carpet in the rooms had stains on them.  The bathtub is very old but clean.  The mirror in the bathroom looked like a 5yr old cleaned it.  It was very noisy with the planes flying over. The beds were very comfortable and the down filled comforter were the best part. The airport van pretty much runs when it wants to.;2
Shuttle service: It is awful. You need to wait in a general hotel shuttle area, instead of in a designated hotel space, so the back-up of shuttle vans and buses coming in is a mess. Then, when you get on the shuttle, you have to stop at several other pick up spots along the perimeter of the airport, so the shuttle becomes more cramped as you go. The more times that the shuttle needs to fight its way to and from the pick-up curbs, the more you want to punch yourself for not taking a taxi. (side one: one taxi driver we did approach refused to take us because the one mile trip wouldn't be worth it for him. So you are basically stuck with the shuttle...or a very desperate cab driver.) Once you leave the airport, you pass the hotel and go to the other hotel that uses the same shuttle;1
We generally stay at this hotel on our way to somewhere.  It is great value because we get the fly/park package which includes the price of a clean, quiet room and parking in their outdoor lot.  We are SPG (Starwood) members so they put us on the foor for members.  The staff are kind, accommodating and professional.  I have rated it a 4 because it is a layover.  Always reliably clean and peaceful...and the free shuttle to and from the airport is great, too.;4
Booked this hotel as they had parking package, 14 days plus room.  Have stayed here before so knew what to expect.  Rooms ok, drawback no safe.  Lobby bar remodeled since last visit. Enjoy the happy hour and light tapas.  Convenient shuttle to LAX every 20 minutes.  Booked with Trinity reservations.;3
This hotel i booked instead of my normal hotel the Hilton. Thought I would try and save a few bucks. Overall the hotel is fine, clean and quiet. The rooms are a bit more tired then I would prefer. The lobby is nice and deceiving I was expecting a very nice room and it did not meet my expectaions. The curtains do not block out enough light. Overall it wasn't worth the money I saved. Ill spend  the extra bucks and stay elsewhere next time.;3
If you're looking for a place to stay for a layover, this is a good choice. Restaurant likes really nice though I didn't eat there. It's a close, free shuttle ride to the airport, but you may have to wait a few minutes for the shuttle when you landed.  No complaints;4
This is a 2 star motel. Read these facts about our room: - no outside windows, only one 2 feet from bed facing a hallway which you have to close the curtain for privacy. So dark room and poor CFL lighting. - no glasses, just plastic cut wrapped in plastic  - $20 parking per night - bathroom door swings 2 inches from toilet. You have to get in the tub to close the door before able to go to the toilet. Or leave the door open. - no shower gel. Just one small bar of soap for both sink and shower - small, no room to set and open the suitcase. Had to set it on the desk.;2
This hotel is a great location for flying into and out of LAX.  Close to bus stops for trips to Santa Monica or shopping.  The Guest Services team were very helpful and knowledgeable about things to do, transport options and were happy to store my luggage after I had checked out, so I could spend the day at Santa Monica before catching my late night flight.;4
I have stayed in a bunch of the hotels around LAX, and have settled on the Four Points as my hotel of choice.  I don't even look at other options anymore.  It turns out that there are some real benefits to staying at this hotel that aren't obvious at first glance, but can make all the difference in how pleasant my travels are.  I travel to LA on business several times a year and, being LA, that means renting a car.  I discovered, almost by accident, that the rental car lots for Hertz and Avis are in easy walking distance to the hotel.  Why is that of interest? For me, it's because I'm usually taking a brutally early morning flight to get home.  The closeness of these lots means that I can, the night before I go home, return my rental car and walk back to the hotel. That means;4
We stay at the Four Points LAX about five-ten times a year when we fly into/out of LAX. The hotel staff know us, appreciate our business, and take great care of us. The bed is great and the room is quiet. We intend on staying there everytime that we are at LAX.;5
I don't feel safe in this hotel because anyone can just go up in any floor of the hotel. They don't have security key card, no security men and no cctv camera on each floor. One of my colleague lost her handbag and suitcase inside her room.;1
We had two rooms that we stayed in.  We were doing the park and fly package.  One of the group woke up very sick with a migraine and had to reroute her plans to fly out and the hotel went out of their way to accommodate her.  They also got her directed to an urgent care and were very helpful and sympathetic to the situation.  It was already a stressful morning so the fact that they just handled things and let her stay longer in her room meant the world to us.  We will use this hotel whenever we get the chance.  Everyone was very friendly and went above and beyond in their jobs.  Rooms were good size and clean and getting back and forth to airport was easy with the shuttle which we never seemed to have to wait.;5
I stayed at this hotel last month on business and I was very pleased.  The rooms are luxurious and squeaky clean, the location is convenient to the airport, and the staff are all friendly and courteous.;4
"It's OK to stay here just for overnight. Staying more will be disappointing.  Rooms are quite OK,  but windows are dirty. You'll hear airplanes' noise 24/7.  Breakfast menu is poor. Quality of ""cheff"" cooking is doubtful. Bacon fried to dark brown too crispy substance, sausages - to black.  Dinner menu poor, overpriced against quality.  Surroundings of this hotel are just other hotels, ren-a-car parkings, couple of fast food eateries and airport runways.  WiFi is free but awful - too slow and instable.";2
Stayed for one night to fly out next day. Very busy hotel but, I felt I was taken care of by the courteous staff. I loved the park n fly option with free shuttle to and from airport. The room itself was nothing to boast about. It was clean but, a little dated and walls too thin. I could hear conversations of people walking by as if they were in my room along with the ice machine dispensing down the hall.  I would stay again for sure. P.S. Farooq, thank you for the help at the parking lot exit gate. I don't think that guy was ever going to get out :);4
This was our second stay in recent months.  The room was clean and the airport shuttle arrived in a reasonable time.  The food in the airport bar is good (burgers and beer).  If you book a room on the airport side of the hotel, you can watch planes land.  For being close to the airport, it was relatively quiet.;4
We were staying in LA for a quick weekend wedding so I selected this location due to the free shuttle, price and proximity to airport and 405. I was expecting a typical hotel airport, but was impressed with the size of this four points hotel, amenities (pool, gym, breakfast buffett) and service. The place was also really clean and modern. I thought it was nicer than the nearby Westin LAX hotel even.;5
Walking into the property looks promising, however my room was far from what I expected. First was the corridor leading to the rooms was dingy, then the room itself was cheap looking with cardboard boxed instead of dresser drawers. The problem however was the air conditioner not working. After several attempts by maintenance to fix it and the temp rising to 84 degrees, I was finally upgraded to a nicer tower. Getting there was a maze through back doors and stairways and service ways, not at all what I would call well designed. The shocker was having to pay an additional 21.00 a night to park in a handicap space on the hotels own property, not included in the price of the room. Thankful the staff moved us but didn't live up to the Sheraton name.;3
This hotel was perfect for us. We were able to return our Budget rental car, then walk across the street to the hotel. We took their shuttle to the airport the next morning. Took about 10 minutes. Check-in was quick and efficient. There are two restaurant on the premises. A bit pricey but the food was good. The room was clean and roomy. The bed was very comfortable. Mini fridge in the room was nice. Would definitely stay here agin of we needed to.;5
"Needed a place at the airport at last minute for 1 night.  Room was small but clean, not very sound proof though.  Main complaint was that the bathroom looked a bit dingy - grout between tiles looked old and dirty and, oddly, the ceiling in there was very low.  I'm 5' 6"" and my head was probably a foot or so from the ceiling - a 6' person probably would have to crouch to see their hair in the mirror.   Water pressure was insanely high!  Shower kind-of hurt! (better than the other extreme I suppose) For the price, it was fine though.";3
Regardless to if your arriving or leaving LA, this hotel is one of the nicest my partner and I have stayed in while visiting the US. The Staff are very helpful and friendly. Great shuttle service to and from airport. Great place all round. Highly recommend for anyone thinking of staying. Will stay again on our next trip.;5
I spent one night here before an early flight home. room was clean but a little bit noisy :( location is very good fot LAX.;3
Stayed on our last day/night in LA. Booked for the ability to stay in the room until 6.00pm the next day for an additional $40.00. With a late night flight this was great as it allowed us to spend the day out and about and gave us time to return use amenities and be fresh at the airport. You are by the airport so don't expect shops scenery etc. Expect convenience. Our room was 'tired 'but adequate. We looked out over the pool area. Very small bathroom. Staff were all friendly and helpful although restaurant staff need to be a bit more attentive to customers. Maybe it may have just been our night. Staff at the bar were very good. A couple of drinks I had never heard of which I asked about were given to me as a small taste as was a couple of beers, no charge. The beer list;3
I recently stayed at the Sheraton Four Points at LAX for one night while waiting for a room to free up in my convention's hotel down the street.  In general, the Four Points was quite good in all respects.  The room was located on the northside of the central connecting block, fifth floor.  It was quiet, clean, and well appointed.  Though a bit smaller than I was expecting, the room was certainly spacious enough for this solo business traveler.  The desk staff were helpful and nice.  Airline crews in evidence as guests.  Gift shop near the main entrance.  Lobby nicely furnished, but a bit noisy for quiet sitting and reading.  More importantly, I noticed no aircraft noise at all in the room, though the property sits only 2,000 feet south of the landing path into LAX. Note the;4
I spent one night here before an early flight home.  Check in was seamless,gold elite status recognized and upgraded room seemed nice until......I opened the frig to put some water in to chill and found the remnants of the previous guests hummus platter in there!  It smelled old.  I called guest services and asked them to come and remove it.  30 minutes later I was still waiting.  Back to the front desk - asked again to have food removed and requested free drink certificate to be given to me so I could have a drink while I waited.  Duly given.  Drank glass of wine in packed bar (nice to see my favorite white wine Albariño on the menu).  Went back to room 30 minutes later and food was gone but so was my complimentary bottle of water!  Back to reception yet again to ask for more;3
I booked this hotel after making plans to fly home from Europe on a flight that got in too late for me to drive more than two hours home.  The hotel's shuttle service, which runs 24/7, was a major reason why I chose to stay here.  I was told that the shuttles ran every 15 - 20 minutes, and it arrived at the airport's hotel pickup area exactly 20 minutes after I got there.  I was slightly disappointed to find out that the shuttle stopped at the Westin Hotel before going on to Four Points by Sheraton, only because I was totally exhausted and wanted nothing more than to get some sleep, the sooner the better.  Once the shuttle arrived at the hotel, check-in was easy and I found the room easily.  The room was large with two queen beds and a large bathroom.  The beds and pillows were;4
We have stayed here before and been very happy. Unfortunately this time was just not right. I had booked months ago a deluxe room for an early check-in after our flight from Australia. The early check-in wasn't available, which was annoying but fair enough. I didn't appreciate the indifferent attitude I received from the desk clerk who told me to come back in a couple of hours and see what's available. I'd requested this months in advance so would've like to have known ahead of time. When I returned at 12 midday I was given a standard room in the older section. I was so deliriously tired I just took it. I had two double beds, a shower that didn't function properly, an air conditioner that struggled to keep the room cool and noisy neighbours up and down the corridor all night.;2
"We stayed here for one night after our LONG flight from Australia. Upon arrival we got in comfortably into our room. 2 large beds which were very comfortable. We enjoyed a meal in the downstairs restaurant. But the next day once we asked for a cab we were shocked when an employee said they will get the ""best service"" for us. Minutes later a big Chevy suburban thing pulls up to take us to our destination. We were shocked that this is what the ""cabs"" were like in America. Little did we know it was a ""limo"" service. We asked to go to a specific shopping centre but instead were dropped off in the middle of no where! ($50 later!!!) We got another cab from there which cost us another $50!! Because we were so far from where we needed to be! We were so unimpressed. All we wanted was a";3
Airport hotels are usually a dump, and you stay there only if you have a late flight arrival and/or an early departure. The rooms are basic, with minimum amenities, but are clean. Staff is quite friendly. What's unacceptable is during the 45 minutes we waited for the shuttle bus, those of adjoining Marriott or other hotels (Radisson, Hilton, etc) circled the airport several times. This is because not only they have fewer shuttle buses, they combine them with the Westin, making it a 2-stop journey. The Sheraton Gateway (also part of Starwood but probably under different ownership) has a separate shuttle bus with more frequent service. Customers standing in line for the shuttle to the airport in the morning say the wait is about 20-30 minutes. So, avoid this one unless you drive.;2
I have stayed at the LAX Four Points Sheraton about 15x this past year.  I can say with 100% confidence, this is one of the best values in Los Angeles! The customer Service is the very best quality of this outstanding hotel team. Lizette, Jealissia and James all are stellar. The Breakfast crew not only serves a delightful, healthy and full of variety fare, they do it w/ the best morning service of any hotel I've stayed at in years! The in-hotel bar/cocktail lounge frequently runs fun, new promotions every week.  This hotel is innovative, has wonderful service and is about .5 miles from LAX--how convenient is that?!? A great place to stay without a doubt!;5
I stayed here prior to a very early flight out of LAX. The parking is pretty expensive (considering I was only there like 8 hours it was about $24).   The lobby was nice enough. The man who helped check me in was a little rude and didn't seem to like his job.  Compared to other Sheraton Four points, the room wasn't good. The bed was great and soft but there it ends. The bathroom was small and outdated. The air conditioning was mediocre at cooling and a little musky smelling/feeling. The shower was kind of gross.   I went to the pub in the hotel for dinner. The poor bartender was also serving a ton of tables so service was super slow. They need to staff the restaurant better so that the poor guy working isn't so over extended.   It's close to the airport so that is convenient but;3
I feel a bit mean giving this only 3 stars, but it was an average airport hotel.  Clean and I felt safe, but the rooms were very noisy (from the neighbours not the planes).  Really nice pool area and the Four Points 24 hour check in or out was great as I had a late flight so I could spend all day at the pool which was great.  Food in the Comfort restaurant was dire and overpriced - avoid at all costs!  I stayed in room 411.;3
Sheraton, just outside the LAX airport, is very convenient and very nice.  The rooms were large, clean and inviting.  We had difficulty getting wi fi on the ipad because it stated there was a charge.  When we asked about it, when checking out, the front desk stated that you apply for the charge, but it is not really charged.  This needs to be clarified at check in.    $14 vehicle charge per night.;4
This is my second return to this particular hotel when I have come to Los Angeles.  I like the service and the beds are comfortable and sleep amazing.  For a hotel close to the airport, I didn't expect much for some reason but I was impressed.  It isn't the fanciest but it is clean and the customer service is great.  The location is steps away from all the amenities you may need and there is not only lot parking but you can even luck up and find on street parking to save a couple of bucks.  I will be back because they say the third times a charm and the way my stays have been, I believe it.  Oh and the most important part is that the prices are very reasonable and you can always find a deal.;5
For our overnight stay in LA we decided to try out the Four Points Sheraton based on location and convenience to the Los Angeles Airport.  The location is ideal and easy to find.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  The rooms are fairly large I also enjoyed the large space for the bathroom.   I found that parking while available isn't always convenient, if you don't get lucky with a stall up front it could be a short walk.  My family did make use of the fitness room and enjoyed the equipment that was available.  While waiting to check out we did notice guest waiting for the free shuttle to the airport, the seemed to take longer than expected.  If staying at the hotel I would recommend leaving extra early for your departing flight if you plan to use the shuttle, some of the;4
The hotel itself in the lobby is nice. But once we started searching for our room it was like a maze and I felt like it was just a plain old and boring motel enclosed with glass. The bathroom seemed outdated. Luckily it was only for the night. If all you need is a place to sleep sure go ahead. I won't be back. On the upside good friendly customer service.;2
Those working at the check-in counter need to work faster and more efficient. The queueing lanes in front of the check-in counter didn't make any sense to me.   I was looking for my room on level 7. It seems this room and some other rooms belong to the old part of the hotel (??) After coming out from the main elevators, I needed to go through the exit door to enter the alley leading to my room. That part of the hotel looks a bit dodgy for me.   The room itself was okay - nice and clean bedsheets. There's also table with some drawers (not sure what it's for because some drawers are permanently locked). Plenty of towel in the bathroom.   I've also ordered supper - the club sandwiches were ok. They delivered pretty fast.   This hotel provides free wifi, however the signal was very;2
We stayed at this hotel before an early morning flight out of LAX. Chose this hotel because we are Starwood members and also needed a place to leave car while we were on a week long vacation . Sheraton does offer a great stay and park rate, including free fast shuttle to LAX.  Arrival to room we noticed it seemed to be more ran down than most Sheratons we have stayed in recently . Room smelled like previous guests body odor,but bedding did appear fresh so we settled in for night. Did not bother calling front desk because it was so late and we had at 5am wake up time . We braved it for the night but would have asked for a room change if we would have arrived earlier in the evening.  Only other complaint was we left behind a booster seat in the room and called twice over our;3
I arrived at the hotel using a cane after falling on vacation.  We were assigned our room and I was pleased to see it right near the elevators, so I didn't have to hobble far.  When I got in the room I realized the desk clerk had given us a handicapped room to help make my stay easier.  Great service without even asking!;5
I had a short but great stay at this hotel. Customer service was great and room was clean. The only thing I would suggest is that arrive 40 minutes prior for the airport shuttle to pick you up. They tell you the shuttle comes every 15 minutes, but I had to wait 40 minutes. Otherwise, everything else was great!;4
Excellent hotel in a very good location. Room was good, clean and mattress was very soft, and I felt very safe here. The hotel has restaurant, which provides some really good food.Tour to universal studio and night tour is available from this hotel. Also, it is very affordable, we booked it for $90 odd dollars through hotwire, worth the money.;5
I arrived at midnight and was out by 5 AM.  The toilet ran all night, the hinge to the little armoire door had broken loose from the side of the cabinet and the door wouldn't stay closed so you had to dos si dos to get by it on way to bathroom, the chrome was coming off of the towel rack - looked like hair on a dog.   They run a shuttle 24 hours to LAX every 12 minutes, sir!  First come, first served.  Take it or leave it, buddy. An excellent but expensive Travellodge. Great location but a hold your nose experience.  I bet they don't respond to this!;2
When we arrived on our floor we were a little concerned as it appears this used to be another hotel which had all outdoor rooms but then they enclosed them. The hallways seemed dated but the rooms are wonderful. Very comfortable beds and to take care of any hallway noise just leave the fan on all night. Great value. Free shuttle to/from LAX.;4
"I am surprised that the reviews for this hotel are so mixed.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here for two nights while attending a science fiction convention.  I showed up at the hotel at 9am hoping that I might be able to check-in early and the lady at the front desk told me to check back at 10:30am. At 10:35am, I was walking by the front desk and the lady said, ""Your room is ready Mr. ChinaShrek.""  I was surprised that she remembered my name and wanted to tell me that my room was ready.  She made me feel like a valued guest.    I paid $89 per night for a deluxe King-bedded room, which was spacious.  The bed was comfortable and the carpet appeared to be quite new.  While the windows are pretty old and not air tight, I did not hear much airport noise and the AC worked well to";4
Stayed here on the last night of our vacation before we flew home. Hotel is very easy to find service is very good and the room is clean and comfy, only down side was the earthquake but I will let the hotel off for that one.;5
Have spent many nights pre/post flight at LAX.  This is the best experience we have had.  The room was spacious, clean and QUIET.  The hotel shuttle runs in a timely manner and the check in desk made sure we got two queen beds even though we didn't check in until after midnight.  Used the park and stay rate. Convenient for parking and stay.  Will definitely visit this hotel for our next trip.;4
No problems with catching the transport from LAX though note that it is not the Sheraton minibus, the Four Points by Sheraton has its own. Seems like it runs about every15 to 20 minutes or so and the trip takes about 5 minutes, it is very close by. You could walk if you wanted to get your fitness effort in for the day. I booked through Hotels.com (slightly lower rate) and check in was a breeze. Rooms are large and comfortable though no tub (only shower) and no refrigerator. There is a coffee maker (Mr. Coffee) and plenty of places to eat in the area including, of course, at the hotel. Large screen TV was nice. Free Wi-Fi sets it apart from some of the local competition and was one reason I chose it over the many other hotels nearby. One thing that confused me, a large window;4
I'm in LA at least a few times a year & stay near airport.This was my first stay here b/c of 24 hr.checkin. Won't need it next time but will stay here anyway. MUCH nicer than pics. on internet!! Spacious rooms, everything is clean, nice beds, almost luxury hotel, small things like big stiff coffee cups in your room for example. great workdesk/chair, nice bathroom, great rest/bar/room service, and I try to stay an extra day to relax by pool which here is very nice! Good gym but could use better weight machines, elevators fast, room keys work, shuttle runs frequently, and everyone is NICE. This makes a huge difference, every one of the staff is accommodating and friendly and provides luxury service. I had better service here than I had last month at the Biltmore-Waldorf Astoria in;5
Don't be fooled by the exterior which is old and dingy.  The hotel is nicely updated inside, has a great gym, a nice heated pool and a really good bar/restaurant right on sight.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the airport shuttle came right on time.  My only minor complaint is no coffee pot in the room (there was a place to purchase it in the lobby).;4
We chose this hotel because of its 24h check in option and it was perfect for us. We arrived just after 8am and were given free coffee and pastry because we had to wait 10 minutes for our room due to the hotel being fully booked the night before. Staffs were very friendly at reception and in the Brewsters restaurant were we had dinner. Room was very spacious and clean. Bed really comfortable and we had no issues hearing planes through the night.  There is a bus stop accross the road were you can catch a bus to santa monica for a dollar. Would definately stay there again if we ever need to stay overnight in lax again.;4
Tyron Waight checked us in and he was soooo sweet and kind. Very thorough and helpful and showed that excellent customer service I look for in a hotel. The hospitality he also showed was above and beyond. Thanks for having such a great staff member on your team! Sarah and Matt Painter;5
So I've stayed at a fair few LAX hotels over the years. Travelling to and from Australia to the States makes this unavoidable. The big issue for me has been that flights back to Australia leave late at night, and the thought of getting on a 15 hour flight after a long day in LA without being able to freshen up before hand has always been an issue. So I was pleasantly surprised to find the Four Points has a 24hr stay option which means you can check in late on one day and not have to check out till the same time the next day. So I took advantage of this option and it works brilliantly. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff helpful. I enjoyed a full day out in LA was able to shower and pack and check out at 7pm and then enjoyed a far more comfortable night flight back;4
We found a last moment reservation, the hotel was good enough, clean rooms, starbucks coffee shop inside, the isolation was good as well, there only negative thing was the parking that was costy, anyway I will go again there.;4
Stayed one night on business. Rooms were big and a bit outdated and borderline shabby. Location was not great for going out (but good for where I needed to be). But staff was nice and the bed was comfortable.;3
"I had a brief overnight stay at the Four Points -- got in at 10:30pm, so the shuttle was not frequent, and I ended up with a taxi (impatient, I know, as a shuttle rolled up just as we left the terminal) which cost $20, including tip.  The morning shuttle to the airport came within 20 minutes or so; I assume I had just missed one -- probably best to get down a bit early.  The hotel has been renovated somewhat, but I found I was in the south wing, where the hall carpets look their age.  Room was, however, clean and comfortable -- good beds and free wi-fi, as well as a large bathroom.  Breakfast buffet was convenient and well stocked, but a little pricey, but that is what one should expect in LA.  All in all, a comfortable stop, and the service was pleasant and courteous.";3
"We stayed here on a layover from Fiji to Florida. We were coming back from an amazing honeymoon so we were pretty relaxed. We waited for a shuttle for about 30 minutes at the airport but that was no biggie because it was around 5 (rush hour). We walk into the lobby which look really nice. We get our key to go to our room and get stuck on the elevator with a reality show crew (it's LA after all). Turns out they're filming a girl in the room directly across from ours. So, her door kept slamming every 5 minutes with production people going in and out. I wasn't pleased with the room or the bathroom, they both seem dated and had an ""unclean"" feeling. My husband assured me I was being too picky so we settled in and showered. I left my lotion at the hotel in Fiji so I used what they";1
We stayed here a few months ago and that's why we came back. This time, however, we weren't as impressed. We stayed in a different area that I think was called the south tower. It appeared to be older and not as nice as when we stayed here before. The faucet head in the tub/shower was loose and you could move in and out from the wall. Seemed kind of tacky. The sports bar here has a great variety of beers and the food is good. In my opinion pricey. But it is hotel food.;3
There was always a line at the front desk of the Four Points, requiring a 5 to 10 minute wait each time.  I needed to visit the desk several times during my stay.  Arriving at the hotel before the 3 pm check-in time, I was initially told that there would be no rooms available for at least one hour.  However, after checking back about 30 minutes later with another individual (and after the inevitable 5 minute wait), he said there were plenty of rooms available and checked me in.  I had asked for a quiet room.  Later that evening, it transpired that the rooms around me were being used by a night film crew.  Production staff were continually going in and out, with doors banging, including the fire escape stairway door.  Consequently very late in the evening and rather jet-lagged, I;2
The good:  avg airport hotel  The issues: Biggest: the hotel shares Shute with another hotel.  So depending on when you go, the bus may be full leaving you to wait for next which may also be full.  They say there's a bus every 20 min & there was only at 5 am when I got to the lobby I had to wait until 540 to get the shuttle;3
Due to travel hiccup, I had to stay at a hotel at the airport at last minute.  The Four Points by Sheraton was able to save the day.  The front desk clerk Tyron Waight was extremely helpful, friendly, fun, and did an outstanding job of going over an above the call of duty.  Check out the bar too. Great food and super selection of beer. The staff know how to pair food/ beer well.  Highly recommended;5
Sadly, I have nothing much to report here.  The hotel is average in every way.  Everything from the hotel staff, to the room, to the lobby and pool.  I guess this is an ok hotel for a quick one night stay if necessary.  I certainly wouldn't choose this hotel for an extended stay.  Also, you should be aware that parking is horrible due to the small lot.  I had to invent my own parking spot in some random corner.;3
Right next to the airport, so it's loud.  No mini-bar, no snack machines, and I just spent over $50 from room service and I'm still hungry.  I can a) spend a minimum of $20 to get a small snack, b) get a cab, c) stay hungry.  The pics of this place are overrated.  It's not nice at all.;2
It does it's job very well - clean, decent accommodation with an airport shuttle.  They know their clientele.  Nothing interesting within walking distance for dining.  We went to In & Out before returning our rental car to Hertz and Hertz dropped us back to the hotel enroute to the airport.;4
"Quick free shuttle ride from LAX-every 20 minutes. Check-in-staff very friendly and efficient. There is a free boarding pass computer near the entrance by the concierge desk. Rooms are ""tired"" but hit all the basics. Beds are very comfy and linens good. It is a little noisy given u r near the airport (close to 30mins by shuttle after all the stops). Bathroom is a tad small. WiFi is awesome in the room and available through the bar area as well. We didn't use the pool but it looked good. Bar has huge beer list and friendly staff. Elevators slow.  Walls a tad thin but no biggie. Convenient location, good service and comfortable room for layovers-we'd come back-good value.";3
We were there for less than 12 hours, but it served its purpose. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. Not a huge room, but enough space. It is a very busy place and even though there was a line, check-in was quick. We had requested a crib, and although it wasn't there initially, it was delivered to the room within ten minutes of our arrival. The shuttle driver was courteous and got us to the airport safely. There is a rental car place right across the street so that also makes it very convenient to pick up or drop of a car.;3
Met a few friends from out of town here and we had a blast. Accommodations were excellent, staff was friendly, and the pool was great. We enjoyed our time hanging out in the bar area and met other visiting guest.;4
I stayed at this hotel for two nights the man at the checkin desk was wonderful. However my room is very basic and had a terrible view of a dirty parking lot and dumpsters which had dump trucks out front at 6 a.m.. The walls are very thin and I could hear my neighbors TV and phone calls through the wall. Also in the gift shop I bought a 20 ounce bottle of SmartWater and it cost me $4.99.;3
"I have stayed at four different hotels near LAX when I have had layovers.  I always pick them based on their having a free shuttle and a decent price.  This hotel met that criteria but not much more.  The desk staff was friendly.  The room had good bed comfort.  The bathroom was not the best and certainly the ""soap, shampoo and conditioner"" were a joke.  Do they really think that 1 oz of shampoo is enough for two people?  The thing that really seemed odd were the timer-like switches instead of actual light switches.  I like the brand but am not likely to return to this one.";3
Was put up here over night when my international flight was delayed by 12 hours.  Was given a room which appeared to be a former motel room made into a hotel by building external walls (the room had an outward facing room looking into the hallway but no windows looking to the outside).    Looking at the hotel website, it appears there are different quality rooms in this hotel -- true hotel rooms which have outside facing windows, as well as these rooms which have windows only facing a corridor.  The walls in this section are very thin -- so you hear anything and everything in the adjoining rooms.    We were also not given a full set of toiletries... conditioner but no shampoo.  Had a meal at the hotel restaurant.. service was perhaps impacted by the large number of last minute;2
You can't go wrong with the Four Points by Sheraton LAX.  Arriving at approximately 9pm on a Wednesday evening after a long flight it was such a pleasant surprise to arrive at the Hotel on the complimentary shuttle (note a taxi ride is a minimum of $19).  The Hotel is large but well laid out and there were staff everywhere to assist with getting guests where the needed to be.  The front desk agent had a bright personality and took the time to inquire about my flight and make general conversation.  The room was clean and had the standard Four Points amenities.  Kudos to the Hotel for offering complimentary wi-fi that was a strong enough signal I could watch Netflix without the signal dropping.  The bed in the room was very comfortable.  The service at the breakfast buffet was;4
Need to stay her and to the park/fly for a week. Chose it due to our SPG points. Our room was on the corner of two major streets which I was not thrilled about, but it was actually pretty quiet. I have to sleep in a totally quiet environment and the noise was hardly any. It was a Monday evening. We were on the 5th floor which is a Starwood Preferred Guest Room Floor. Loved the complimentary two bottles of water due to our status. Thanks!   I loved the white bathroom with the awesome lighting so I could see to put my make up on. Our room was huge, it was a corner room with a entry room and bedroom area. I like the shallow depth vanity too so I could get close to the mirror. It was adequate for our nights stay for needing a place to crash to catch the shuttle and head to the;4
I have to say that this hotel is my best choice when I arrive in Los Angeles. This is a good structure, American Style. I booked a big suite with two big king beds. The room was very clean, the service was good. Pickup service from and for the airport.;4
Just stayed overnight for my morning flight. Staff people were super. Room was fantastic, bed ultra comfy. Only snag was the shuttle to the airport. It is shared with other hotels. It showed up full after waiting 20 minutes. Had a bit of time, so I was OK. But be aware.;4
I stayed here while passing through on vacation. I had stayed at the Radisson the night before and it was horrible with mold on the bed skirts and bloody looking stains in the carpet. My room here was somewhat outdated looking but it was clean and nice. It did not affect my comfortableness at all. Very convenient for the area. The only issue I had was with the $19 parking. There is NO free parking like the website says on it under features located on fourpointslax.com. However, after I showed the clerk the site on my phone, she gave me free parking. I was completely satisfied. Def beats the Radisson by a long shot!!;4
Needed to be close by both the Airport and the Hertz car rental, so this facility worked well.  Was able to return our Hertz rental car the night before our very early morning flight out of LAX, and easily walk back to the hotel from the rental parking lot.  I noticed the Budget was even closer, so that would have been good too.  That's a positive. Another positive is the shuttle was there to take us to the airport very early (5:15 am) the next morning for our flight.  The room was pleasant (Deluxe room, East Tower). We were worried when we got there because there was  bunch of people milling around the hallway, talking and laughing loudly, but when we got into our room it must have been extra sound-proofed, because we (thankfully) couldn't hear any of the commotion out in the;3
Our second visit, and we were not disappointed. This is a clean, well-run, decent value hotel. Check-in staff were extra helpful and arranged a fridge in our room within minutes of the request. We enjoyed the breakfast. The room was quiet as regards aircraft noise, but as with most airport hotels, there are a lot of arrivals and departures at all hours of the day and night. Easy airport shuttle and good access to the car rental lots on Airport Boulevard.;4
I normally stay at the Sheraton Gateway when flying home early in the morning from LAX. The Four Points was $20 cheaper this time so I gave it a try. I normally rent a car from Budget, which is right across the street from Four Points so I returned my car the night before my flight to avoid paying for hotel parking. There is a free airport shuttle the picks up at many local hotels, and the Four Points was the last stop so you don't have to tour the neighborhood before getting to the airport.   The bed in the room was comfortable, but I wasn't thrilled on the overall room. It's in need of some updating. I also had a good bit of door-closing noise in the hallway. But for $100 in this neighborhood, it's a decent value.   My first choice in the area remains the Sheraton Gateway, but;3
This was a long awaited trip with the family that went perfect. It was good service until the security guard started screaming at me to get out of the pool. I understand if it was just after 11pm, but there was no reason to be so rude about it. The parking is terrible. I would pay for valet parking, but to pay to park your own car, for $25 a night???;4
we arrived to our room and first thing we do is go to check the beds, lift up a pillow and there was a bed bug right there! We left immediately and called Expedia to get reimbursed. Expedia was very helpful and apologetic, they dealt with the hotel for is only to have the manager of the hotel Hang up on them.  Hotel is dirty, run down, and awful service! DO NOT STAY THERE!;1
So we fly to LA at least 4 times per year and usually used the 4 Points as a transition between the airport and going up or down the coast. But not anymore. We road the shuttle and the heating was like 100•, it was full, but still had two places left. We stopped at the next exit and a guy was just about to get on when the driver decided to leave. He had him banging the side of the bus running but with no avail.   Then we got to our room. The size was tiny, NY style tiny. Decided to take a shower and the tub was clogged. When I took a bath towel it had several stains in all shapes and colors. I'm still disgusted as I remember it.   The beds are soft and more like a hammock because you can really tell where others before you had slept.  The guy at the reception desk was very;2
Stayed here one night for an early morning flight out.  Room was nice and comfortable.  No complaints there.  Didn't use many amenities.  Restaurant and bar downstairs was great.    Airport shuttle that comes makes this its last stop meaning it is packed when it arrives!  Bags and people piled on top of each other at 4 am is no fun. I know this isn't the hotel's fault but maybe they need to arrange their own private shuttle for guests.;4
The rooms were lovely. Unfortunately the only time it was quiet enough to sleep in my room - 982 - was between 2am when the roar of jet engines at LAX ceased for the night and 4am when the constant reversing beeps of forklifts etc started. Could not recommend this hotel as a place to get a good sleep.;2
I wanted to swim, work, and rest - and I did. The pool wasn't highly chlorinated so the swims were very enjoyable. The room was spacious and service was prompt and with a smile - very important in LA. I didn't have the sense of disgruntled workers - a plus in my book. I was sorry to be placed in a room where I could hear the airplanes so be sure to request the other side of the building - however, it didn't bother my capacity to work or my ability to sleep. Still, I'd advise requesting the quiet side. Food in the restaurant was surprisingly delicious. Try the grilled asparagus - great - and the linguini with clams was quite tasty and the pasta perfectly cooked. The bar food was less satisfying and too many TV's everywhere for my tastes. You can get delicious espressos and;4
"We arrived last evening for a 5 night stay.  Room was very warm when we arrived, turned on air conditioning, 3 hours later hadn't cooled down even a degree. ... We were moved to a different room and now this morning the air conditioning in here has stopped working as the temp jeeps rising! So we will be visiting the manager on duty again.   Also upon going to the front desk last evening concerning the a/c, upon entering the hallway we were greeted by the very strong aroma of pot.  We told the manager on duty about this as well and her response was,  ""we have a non smoking policy but there's nothing I can really do about it but spray air freshener."" That then would explain why there was a remnant of a joint in the stairwell. Nice! Might be a long remaining 4 nights!";3
Stayed here for one night before the flight. Location was convenient and close to car rentals. The hotel itself is worn out, so don't expect too much when it comes to rooms. There is a hidden gem in this hotel that you should checkout if staying here. It is the bar close to the lobby. Extensive selection of beers and friendly personnel. That made our stay there much better.;3
The hotel staff was extremely helpful  and polite. Tyron Waight offered amazing customer service!!!! The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. The location was amazing for my business training. I will definitely use this hotel again!!;4
Wanted too find an SPG hotel close to LAX since my  granddaughter was flying in from Las Vegas so we can fly to Hawaii the next morning.  At first I was not sure. But I was welcome with a big smile by the front desk clerk and it made me feel at ease.  I left my car at the hotel while I was out of town and there were no problems when I  returned.  Missed happy hour darn it.  Clean room and great customer service.  Five days later we returned from our trip,  i put my granddaughter on her return flight and I knew I had a 60 mile drive ahead of me. So I decided to check back into the hotel for a good night sleep before going back to work the next morning. Great idea and perfect choice.;4
I should've known what to expect when the check in parking lot only had so few spaces available because they blocked off the rest for whatever reason I'm not sure.  The guy who checked me in wasn't that engaging nor friendly, like he didn't really want to be working. Show some enthusiasm for a few minutes please?    $19 to park car, and no, it's not comped for hotel guests.  Yes, free wifi is great but the signal is poor.  Once you arrive at your floor, the signs to point you to your room could be displayed better, I had to backtrack around a few times before I found my hotel room.  The room itself was a bit drab and uninviting inside.;2
"I will say that the young man at the front desk did a good job having to deal with a long line of late night check-ins by himself.  He was efficient and sometimes that's the best you can hope for at 1:30 in the morning.  I was surprised at how ""modest"" the room was.  Its furnishings felt even more spartan than that of a room at a Fairfield Inn.    I suppose that the rate I paid was justifiable for convenience, in that, it was just off Century Boulevard near the entrance to LAX.  And, while I appreciated the free shuttle that was waiting for me as I exited baggage claim, I didn't like that we passed the Four Points property to first drop off passengers staying at the Westin LAX.  I hope that the Starwood folks consider improving the Four Points brand.  Marriott and Hilton";3
Ok yes the hotel is a little run down but who cares with such great service! When I checked in after a long day, long and bad flight and bad experience with rental car place Tyron greeted me and with a smile. Let me vent. Made me feel so much better! Then gave me a free breakfast. I then spoke to Adam the manager the next day about how great Tyron was and he was just as amazing! Threw-out my stay ALL staff smiled and said hello when you walked by and asked if you need something. Thumbs up in Customer service!!!! Oh and GREAT mojitos!;5
Can't say it was the best hotel and it wasn't the worst hotel in the century Blvd corridor. Good night sleep with a good staff. All my expectations were met. I'm planning on going back. The shuttle service was timely and parking although pricey I paid more at the other hotels in the area I stayed with. Deluxe rooms are worth the extra money I paid.;5
Had a bad flight experience and landed late in LA vs San Diego and need a room. Most hotels I passed as I exited the airport could not accomodate and came to the Sheraton LA Airport. Made my way in and while waiting in line to check on room availability overheard the staff dealing with an unruly and problematic customer. Once completed Tyron welcomed me to the hotel and you would not have known he had jsut completed that task, he was not only on point he was pleasant and immediately addressed my needs. As an inquisitive sales person, I asked about dealing with customers like that and what drove him and he was quick to point out how he loved the business and aspired to move up and manage his own hotel. This was obvious in his care for me as a client, taking me from a weary and;5
"We usually stay at the LAX when we have an early flight.  I don´t really like these big fancy hotels. They feel so cold. The last times we have stayed in Sheraton Four Points and it feels ""home"". Cozy good feeling and staff is wonderful. Special thanks to Jess for helping us.";5
My wife and I stayed at the Four Points LAX for one night in February 2014. We chose this hotel primarily because they offered a 24-hour room rate. We had an early arrival into LAX, and being able to immediately head to the hotel and rest was wonderful. The hotel's shuttle (which also serves the Westin LAX) picked us up from the airport, and our room was ready on our arrival.  The Four Points LAX is also across the street from the LAX Budget Rent-a-Car lot. This was helpful when we rented our car from Budget and needed to exchange it the following day.  The room itself was fairly basic, but it was clean. Beds and shower were fine. The AC/heating system is a window unit, so that did generate some noise. There was also noise from planes -- I have stayed at airport hotels in;4
I cam in late but the bar was still open which was a plus, and then I left early but the restaurant had breakfast ready, although I didn't have tie to try it though .  The rooms are spacious and clean, I didn't hear any noise whatsoever. You get the usual toiletries and your in-room selection of coffee and tea. The wi-fi is free and there is a shuttle service to and from the airport.  I was in a hurry so instead of waiting for the shuttle I asked for a taxi, it got there in less than 5 minutes and within another 5 I was at the terminal;4
When I have a morning flight out of LAX, I like to stay near the airport the night before...  preferably across the street from Budget Rental Car so I can turn my car in the night before and get a good night's sleep.  My first choice of hotels is the Renaissance on Airport Blvd., with the Four Points a distance second.  The Four Points is an older hotel, and not nearly as well soundproofed as the Renaissance.  The sleeping rooms typically have adjoining doors, allowing even more sound creep.    This stay I ended up in the East Tower, and my choices were to listen to planes all night or try to cover the noise with an antiquated HVAC unit.  I didn't get much sleep.    Room service for dinner was decent.  They forgot my soup, and delivered it later, but everyone makes mistakes.;3
Each time we stay at the Four Points Sheraton LAX we are impressed by the very comfortable room and the friendly staff.  They have a good van pickup service at LAX and are located very close to the airport.  A fine place to stay overnight near LAX after a long flight.;5
As a Platinum member of Starwood Hotels, I couldnt be more thankful to Julian Brito and the entire Four Points Sheraton staff for welcoming me under very difficult travel disruption circumstances upon my arrival from Europe. The customer service is exceptional, the rooms are extremely spacious and clean, and, for a hotel to choose for an overnight stay at the airport, i couldnt think of any other choice. Thank you again, Four Points!;5
My second stay at this hotel.  Great if you are solo traveller for work or pleasure.  It is directly across the street from Budget rental car's main LAX hire facility.  Its a perfect hotel for that late night arrival and early getaway in a rental car.    Its nothing special if travelling with a partner or family.  Although what can I say.  On both my stays it has been a quick arrival, sleep and leave.  I didn't bother looking around.  However there are a few wings on this hotel, therefore I suspect my cheap rate got me in the older tower.   I think a higher rate will get you in the newer wing perhaps with larger, newer rooms.  But it is fine. I came back.  Rooms are smallish, but big enough for one person.  Wi-Fi included so this is a big bonus.;4
Like several hundred other East-Coast bound passengers, I got stuck in LA because of the weather. Considering myself a road warrior, I had planned to do a trip from  JFK to LAX in one day. Well it turned out to be a day form hell. AT any rate, this hotel is 10 minutes from the airport, they quickly accommodated this tired soul and even upgraded me without asking. Food was good but they forgot to bring a spoon for my soup. not a big deal. I like these guys.;4
We stayed overnight at LAX and found the hotel clean, bed comfortable, staff were friendly. Room service was slow but manager then said meal was free due to wait. Hotel is getting  a bit dated but would stay here again/;3
Other than Julian Brito the assistant front office manager there is nothing to really brag about at this property. If you get Martha at the SPG Platinum desk please ask to be changed to a different agent because she is extremely mean and rude. She does us a favor by checking us in. Horrible. But my life savior Julian was the man of the hour.  They entered my room by 1:30pm with the DND sign at the door. I showed up at the room after the room service was done since I had stepped out, the cleaning lady would not let me enter saying it was too late and she had already cleaned up the room. It took me 15 minutes to get the issue resolved. Finally I got my 4:00pm check out after speaking with Julian once again.  The bar is good with Christie in it, however a smile on her face would;3
Martin at the front desk checked us in and out and was helpful.  Sadly that was the only good thing about the hotel.  The rooms are small and do not have any amenities.  The drains ran slow, the room smelled musty, and the temperature was impossible to control.  One night we were roasting, the next night freezing.  The elevators are dangerous, the doors shut on me twice. The parking is frustrating, since people get stuck at the gate and you have to wait for an attendant to come out. It was more of a budget hotel, yet it holds the Sheraton name, so you expect more.  Very disappointing.;2
Very nice Hotel, location was good for what we needed. The Customer Service was top notch! Tyron W. Checked us in and made sure every question I had was answered, he even played tour guide in helping us get to the concert, he was always smiling and laughing,laughing. THANK YOU it is nice to see an employee happy to be doing his job and doing it well...keep up the good work;4
"I booked this property based on photos knowing that's always risky. THEN I read online reviews that really worried me about what I was in for. However, when I got to the property, it was nothing like the bad reviews had described (TripAdvisor reviews - good; Yelp reviews - bad). It's actually a very nice mid-range hotel with a lot of amenities. The people are friendly. The property is in good shape for an older remodel. The bed was super comfy, and the pillows are phenomenal. LodgeNet TV w/1 movie channel (Showtime) and a few other channels. Lots of lounge, bar, meeting areas available. I did not notice any smoke smell, but that just comes along with the territory anyway. Two tips - the check-in desk is well inside the front door (near the atrium area). Also, they charge $19/day";4
Another great stay at Four Points in between flights. Very friendly, efficient, clean and everything necessary for a good stay: airport shuttle, free WiFi, pool, guest laundry and decent room service food. One small minus - smoking around the pool area. Considering this is where kids play and people work out, it might be better to restrict it to the front of the hotel. Thank you for accommodating special needs of my 80 year Mom after 14 hour transatlantic flight! Everyone on the staff was super friendly and helpful but especially Julian Brito, Juan Vasquez and Teresa Martinez. Hope to stay with you again!;5
We were very happy with our recent stay at the Four Points LAX.  Of special note were the very warm and efficient people at the desk (I believe the woman's name was Janelle?), and to our surprise, the room service food was just delicious.  The rooms are more than adequate and since we are SPG members, we were upgraded, giving us a roomy bathroom.;4
Sunny weather outside,sunny people inside.Nothing was too much trouble.Coffee bar staff found live soccer from UK for me at 6 a.m.Never been treated like VIP before,felt like one when I left.Congratulations to check-in,security,room and all other staff.Keep up the good work.;5
The Fourpoints came to the rescue.  Would love to blame the internet, but for some reason, I could not find my reservation confirmation at the Sheraton.  I was able to book a room at the Four Points Sheraton at the last minute, and I really appreciate the service of the staff.  In particular, Tyrone W. at the front desk came through, by finding me a room with two beds (I was traveling with my son).  The hotel was perfect for our purpose - a quick overnight stay at LAX, and everyone who we encountered at the hotel was very nice and helpful.  This is definitely a convent location for travelers who need a place to stay overnight at LAX.;4
This hotel was gorgeous! The staff was very helpful and friendly. We were able to check in quickly and get right to bed, since we had an early flight. This hotel was very clean and relatively quiet, even with close proximity to LAX. Great stay for taking off from LAX in the morning. The bathroom was a little small, but very clean.;4
I stayed there for 3 days, the only nice thing was it was close to the airport. The rooms were old and laid out like the old motels with outside entrances to the rooms. It's not really up to modern  standards by any means. It feels more like it's out of the sixties. The lobby is OK as well as the check in area. But I won't really stay there again.;3
Fulfills the minimum - a clean bed and a warm shower, but very little else. Was booked here by my airline after a missed connection - the hotel issued food vouchers $20 below the value on the airline voucher. The food options are very basic but still 'overspent' the voucher allowance. By the time I noticed, it was too late to question as the airline voucher was 'gone'. Only a small handful of $ but an important principle. I am confident they still bill the airline the full amount. Low end facilities and staff who barely seemed bothered - mostly. Avoid if you pay for it yourself - there are plenty of better options near LAX - and carefully check their 'special airline food vouchers' if you're sent here by an airline and don't let them get away with their little scam.;2
This is a completely 100% non smoking hotel but a non smoker would never guess that.  The hallways and rooms wreak like an ashtray from abuse from smokers.  We changed rooms 2 times and finally gave up.  They all are caked in smoke deep into the old carpets and furniture.  They have signs everywhere warning you of a $200 fine for smoking but clearly the persons enforcing it are smokers too and since their nose is ruined from self abuse, they cant tell if someone has been smoking in a room or not.  They don't even know that they walk around smelling like an ashtray, let alone the rooms here at this hotel.  Completely unacceptable hotel that Sheraton calls a Category 3.  This hotel is a minus -3.  Worn out, dilapidated, and in crappy condition.  Stay some place else.  Any place is;1
This hotel is very close to LAX. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are cozy. I couldn't really hear the airplanes fly by. The bar was really good too. All in all I would recommend this hotel, it is smaller than most there at LAX but it worth it.;4
This stay went wrong from the reservation on. The gentlemen I called from SPG tried to make amends, but this backfired. The rate on the SPG website could not be had, so I called the 1-800 number. They also could see the rate, but not secure it. So instead booking elsewhere, he threw in breakfast vs. $16 higher cost. I get to the hotel and they will not honor the breakfast. I call customer satisfaction, with a 30 min hold, and they try to secure my breakfast. It goes all the way up to the GM before an OK is secured. Then I had to go back down to the front desk and wait in line to get the voucher. The desk preceded to tell me such a great deal I was getting. A $10 breakfast buffet for $16 & a hour of my time??? Sheraton should go to Marriott for customer satisfaction lessons.;2
The Four Points offers a 24h shuttle service to LAX, the hotel is 5 min from the LAX, but there`s a warning inside the shuttle about 45 min in the rush time and traffic conditions. The hotel is clean and there is a Burger King in front of, if u are arriving late at night and don`t want to spend 30 USD for a burger inside the hotel. The Burguer King is not open 24h, but the closing time is late at night. The room has a comfortable bed and the front desk is ok.;4
I've used the Sheraton Four Points several times for business. The price is right and generally it suits the needs. One of amenities that I look for is a decent gym. They have just enough gym tools to be suitable, but this time a few of the things in the gym were broken for the entire week of my stay. Also I don't know what the deal is with the magnetic swipe door keys, but 3 times I had to have it reactivated, and it can be a real inconvenience when your hands are full and/or you've had a long day and all you want to do is get back to your room to relax, but instead you have to go back down to the desk and stand in line for a new key.;3
My status of preferred Guest was not recognised, because I booked by booking.com This is a ureasonable hotel policy The hotel has not a free parking, the room are very very small The bath is small and not in good clean conditions The moquettes in the corridor very old and durty;2
I wish people had better brand understanding out there as it is not anywhere on these reviews. If you want a cheap nice hotel that doesn't charge parking then don't come to LA, SD, SF, etc. Great quality and it started with Tyron Waight at check in. Perfect Platinum check in. It is annoying to have to remind front desk agents of the proper check in process and he nailed it and then some. Then went to Brewsters and was blown away. Great craft beer and service with Ozwaldo and Justin was great! Highly recommend this for airport or LA, stays;5
"My wife, baby, and I checked in after a flight delay and were given a decent room, with two queen beds, but cudn't get in after keys didn't work.  Security came after a long wait then let us in after checking my name with reception.  A few hours later, somebody barges into our room and asks, 'is this 544?' We had the indoor security lock hooked so he said it with the door cracked but his key got the door open!  They walked away.     Soon after, reception calls and says, ""who are you""? I answered, 'you figure it out '!  You checked us in. "" Then security came knocking on my door, the same person who let us in before wanting to talk to me, I told her to go away, let us sleep.    Finally, a lame manager calls me and asked again, ""who are you?"" What is this, a bad comedy?  She was";1
I've had mostly good experiences with Four Points, and this version did not disappoint.  It's located right across the street from LAX, which makes it considerably quieter than the Westin down the street, which is almost right on top of the airport.  I still recommend using a white noise machine or app on a smartphone to conceal the airplane noise.  The rooms at the Four Points are very good for a hotel in this price range.  While there is an obvious aesthetic and appointments difference between Four Points and Westin in general, this Four Points had a very comfortable bed, decently sized room and adequate bathroom.  The bathroom is not nearly as nice as a Westin bathroom, but you do get an empty mini fridge at Four Points (not at Westin) and a very good breakfast buffet.  The;4
This is the second year we've stayed at Four Points Sheraton while traveling out of LAX. Sheraton offers a package where you can leave your car in secured underground parking for up to 14 days with one night stay. You only pay for the room. With the traffic to and around LAX questionable at any time of day, the chance to get a good nights sleep and use the hotel suttle only ten minutes away from LAX plus leaving the car secured for the length of your trip is simply too good to pass up. Hotel staff are always pleasant and helpful. Rooms are well appointed, clean and quiet (if you request a room facing interior of hotel where jet noise is minimal). Rates are better than most hotels in the area. I would highly recommend Four Points and will certainly stay there again.;5
Great stay from start to finish. Especially helpful was Tyron Waight who made sure everything was in order. Recognized me as SPG Platinum, got my bonus points and upgrade, and was very courteous- treats you like a human being which is rare these days. Thanks Tyron! Tim Waite;5
The staff here were very, very pleasant and helpful. We got an early check-in (MUCH appreciated after landing from Australia at 7am) and the two gentlemen at the concierge desk were just great. Very nice. Thank you for booking the VIP Tour for us weary jetlagged passengers - it ended up being the best thing we could have possibly done, as we were incapable of thinking for long enough to work out where we wanted to go!   Thank you for the free shuttle from LAX.  We got upgraded to a slightly nicer room than the one we had booked. Beds very comfy and the room very clean. Plenty of space for 3 people. Bathroom was great - lots of light.  We had lunch at the restaurant near the ballroom/pool - great service, quiet, very comfy lounge, and huge amounts of delicious food.  We wanted to;4
Flew to LA for the Rose Bowl.  The hotel is a low end property that charges premium rates.  Parking is limited even though I had paid for parking as part of my package.  I chose the hotel because it advertises that is has been renovated in the last two years.  The renovations certainly are not apparent in the rooms.  Beds are horrible, carpet is worn, bathtub looks like it is the original.   Needed to call maintenance to unplug the drain so the water in the tub would drain....disgusting.  This is at best a 2 star hotel and wouldn't recommend the hotel unless you are stranded at LAX and need a simple room for an overnight stay.;2
This hotel is inexpensive ($82/night for 4 people in a double room) and conveniently located in the Los Angeles area.  However, it is run down, needs repairs and renovation and a bigger parking lot.  Our room (West Tower, which is supposedly better than the East Tower) had an awful sounding air conditioning.  It sounded like an airplane taking off (and no, I am aware we were next to the airport, but it was considerably quiet for being so close to the airport). THe good news is that most of the nights we did not even need a/c since it was cold out.  I decided not to complain, as we had already unpacked and I did not want to change rooms.   The parking lot was a mess at night.  We had to fend for ourselves, parking wherever there was space, even in non-spaced areas.  Luckily, they;4
booked a two double bed room (party of 3) but none to be found when we checked in. Sure.. got upgraded but the room had a King and a pull out sofa bed.   Loved the food at the bar/grill.  Services was great for 12:30am order.;4
"I booked and paid for the hotel online. As i arrived on a weekend, i removed all funds from my credit card so i could pay cash before returning to australia.

They charge $5 a day parking and don't have enough spaces for all the cars first off.  The front desk told me I have to unload my vehicle at the rear of the hotel, then walk back to the front for the elevators.  We had some luggage so I searched for a luggage cart.  None available.  So I hit up the bell clerk and they told me they would send someone to the back for us.  Twenty five minutes later, STILL NO LUGGAGE CART.  I started moving our luggage to the 4th floor in shifts while my wife stayed with the car.  A worker contacted my wife and told her she was not allowed to wait and had to move the car - Uhmmmmmm.......  No parking spaces?  She had to drive around the lot and wait for me to pop out for round two of the luggage move.  I should've gone to Embassy Suites across the;1
I'm SPG Platinum and have stayed at many of the hotels near LAX. In general, I think this property gives you a fair amount considering its reasonable rates. Previous reviewers have complained about the facility and staff, but I have had good experiences with both. I have stayed at this hotel several times, including a recent stay with my family on New Year's Eve 2013. During that stay, the airport shuttle took a while to pick us up at the airport (30+ minutes) and the lobby of the hotel was very busy, including a fairly sizable line for check-in. However, the desk clerks were helpful, and the staff members who assisted us with our luggage were friendly and knowledgeable. The lobby has been remodeled recently, and the hotel has a small but modern pool area that the kids enjoyed;3
The hotel was fine. It was clean and reasonably well appointed.    Fortunately we were able to turn the car in to the rental agency, just across the street, because it was $19.00/day to park a car.  That, in my opinion is a huge rip off.  We were just there overnight for an early flight out of LAX so I cannot comment on the amenities of the hotel.;3
"We'll it started when I arrived 10 minutes before check in time - there was a couple in front of me talking to clerk and as soon as they left I was rudely told "" we are not checking anyone in early ""  ""didn't you hear me tell the people before you "".

Checked in - I went to the tower my room was in - one of the 3 elevators was out of service with a handwritten sign stuck to doors ( tackey) - the elevator I went into was way out of adjustment - the door slammed on a lady behind me and it was a wild rocky ride to the 4th floor - I exited elevator and was appalled at the run down corridor -";3
Stuck at LAX for xmas day, we had to hotel it for the night. We've stayed at various LAX hotels in the past, and our expectations were middling. We were absolutely blown away when we lucked into the FourPoints. A very modest tariff gave us a large room with a very comfortable king size bed. (Much appreciated after the hard bed we had endured for a while in Barcelona). The room was fresh and clean, the wifi was free as it should be. (These days paying for wifi is like asking clients to pay extra for a door on their room). Just everything was positive and I would recommend this hotel to anyone, regardless of their capacity to pay.;5
Don't be fooled by the pictures. The TV is terrible. You can barely see the image. The bathroom door does not lock. When arriving I had to look for someone to help me with luggage because there was nobody available. I wait for like 10 min to someone come to help.  Beside, they rent my room with me and my family inside to another guest. They opened my door and were entering the room. Can you believe? The bathroom is minimum. Never will be back.;1
"A very important issue is that there is no fridge/minibar in the room.  If you are flying out and want to buy some food to store for the flight the next day, you are out of luck.  The food at the airport is pretty expensive with very few options, so it would be nice to bring your own supplies onboard.  The room supposedly has two queen size beds but I believe they are more like doubles. The room is a bit cramped but has a nice desk space with a larger than normal flat screen tv. It is quite noisy; I could hear the outside world all night as well as people above us and in the hallway. The bathroom is sufficient though the European style flush toilet really is stupid. They provide nice toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. Lobby is nicest part of the hotel as far as";3
This hotel is bizarre! The room window overlooks the hallway! You won't get any sun in your room. And no, I don't mean the hallway is outdoors... the hallway is indoors with a window on the other side. If I'm staying in LA I want sunshine in my room! The lobby is nice and there's a cute pool area. Close to the airport and has a shuttle which is convenient. Not walkable to anything except other hotels so rent a car.;3
Booked and prepaid online, we used the courtesy airport shuttle, which runs 24/7, and on about a 20 minute frequency.  Our room was ready for us on our arrival and we had good service on checking in.  The room was  clean and tidy, albeit it looking a little tired.  The kids went down to the pool and commented that it was nothing special.  For a six hour lay over it was great, and we will definitely get a hotel room close to the airport for a lay over of a similar duration again, and for an over night lay over it would be fine, but there are lots of choices close to the airport, and we will probably try somewhere else next time.;3
I used this hotel for the first time for a park & fly package that they offered. I arrived late on a weekday night (non-holiday) and had a very difficult time finding someplace to park in the uncovered parking lot area. I finally found one spot that was very narrow with two large vehicles parked on either side. It was then a fairly long walk from the parking spot into the hotel. The hotel itself was clean and the staff was friendly. The room was on the small side but was nicely furnished and appeared clean. Same can be said for the bathroom. The airport shuttle serves several hotels so there was a longer wait than I had anticipated but still got to the airport in plenty of time. The hotel was fairly priced for what they offered. I would rate it an average to slightly above;3
"Superb communication; authentic caring to make our stay great. Dinner was recommended, breakfast passes for platinum member ship was given to me. Where to park and have my car protected and ready for me upon my return. Mr. Waight became Four Points and it worked well for us. Thanks";5
We booked this hotel due to its location near LAX airport. Our worst experience ever, after all hotels and even Airbnb we've stayed from Europe to Asia.   - When we arrived (5 ladies with 10 suitcases), the staffs saw us and kept chatting, waited until we unloaded everything, then went out to ask if we need help.  - Came up to the room: 1 bottle of water for 6 people (we booked 2 double rooms for 8), no toothpaste & toobrush, no room slipper. We had to call and ask for everything. - Second date, we came back at late night. We needed some salt. Called front desk. They picked up and slammed the phone. Called them again. No answer.  - Our little sister saw only 1 water bottle. Called and checked: they said water only free for 1st day, after no more. We checked with the house keeper;1
"I checked into this hotel and was hungry by evening. went down to the small restaurant/bar and sat down. The waitress on duty that night looked right at me and did not come over to me or give me a menu for 10 minutes. I felt that she basically was ignoring me. It took another 20 minutes to get my order to go, and the guy who cooked the food came out set the partial order down on the table and went to go cook the French fries!! by the time they came out the order was cold, but I mentioned to him about the waitress. when told about it she replied ""I was busy"" I won't ever go back to this hotel again because of  her rude and poor customer service.";2
Room was very small and outdated. Bed was comfortable. Customer service was excellent on the check in, was not so good on the check out. No complementary work station Free wifi is useless without a computer to use. Was disappointed in the stay. Expected more from Four Points.;2
The hotel was exactly what what my sister and I needed after a long 22 hours flight.  They took care of us the minute they saw us in the airport.  When we reached the hotel, the driver not only took our luggage down from the shuttle bus, but managed to find someone in the hotel to deliver them to the room.  The check in and out was a breeze.  I noticed the restaurants and bar were all open at 9pm.  We couldn't find anything wrong with the room.  The bed was very comfortable, bathroom was very clean, and we had a very quiet and restful sleep.  We didn't get to try the breakfast because of the early morning flight.  The shuttle service to the airport was quick and the driver courteous(a different guy from the night before).   I think my sister sums it up pretty well after our stay;4
I wasn't crazy about this hotel and doubt I will return. Despite the cheap rate and free wifi, the room we received was in need of a renovation and that affects my rating for this hotel. The bed was fine and my jet-lagged sleep was acceptable, but the broken and dirty bathroom tiles and gash in the wall did affect my stay. I think it depends on how you rate those things, I think. I will shout out that the restaurant and breakfast staff were attentive and nice.;3
Great location, easy check in and check out. Nice breakfast. Lovely staff. Room was nice and clean, bed was lush and comfortable. Could not fault the hotel. About a 10 minute walk to the Hilton (bus stops are located outside the Hilton). Safe area, was fine to walk to the hotel at night time. Airport shuttle was great.;5
"Been there with husband. Wanted a cheap and convenient hotel near LAX for 1 night before moving to a house  - Paid $90 +taxes - Asked to have our bags delivered to the room while we had lunch - Answer:  ""Not possible"" - Asked where to park the car: Answer: ""Pay $19 for it"" - Breakfast really really  horrible for $16-   Room ok with basic bathroom. I know the price for the room was cheap but you must add the price of the other services. Besides, if I want to get basic motel services, near an airport, I expect to pay $50 (actually that was the price of the motels available).";2
There was nothing on the website stating I would be paying to park also I was not informed that there would be a 300 hold on my card and I would only get 39 back from that hold, when I went to the front desk to ask them to explain it to me I got a very rude woman who helped me, she had nothing but an attitude all because I wasn't understanding! I will never stay here again!;3
"This hotel is great place to stay if arriving or leaving on a trans-Pacific fight via LAX. In our case we were coming in from Australia and were looking for an early check-in since the 12+ hour flight arrives at 6:30 am. In the past I have always had to end up calling to see if I could arrange an early check-in before making a reservation and of course paying for that privilege. However, this time I found this wonderful offer by Four Points entitled Check-in & Check-out Anytime"" which provides a 24 hour stay for the one-night rate no matter when you check-in.  However, having made the reservation based on this offer what we found was we got a lot more than we had any right to expect. The shuttle bus is shared with the Westin and runs every 15 minutes day and night so we got";5
We stayed here using the park and stay method. We stayed the night before our flight in the morning and that works well. The staff was very friendly and the hotel is very close to the airport. Yes you can here the airplanes but it wasn't anything that would deter me from staying here again. The planes don't land too late at night anyway.;4
This is a great hotel for LAX and has been refurbished since we last stayed here.The staff are great and the rooms updated, clean and comfy beds with nice linens.We didn't eat here as it was a little pricey ! Internet was free but the car parking was way to expensive at $33 a night and because of this we will now stay at hotels that don't charge i.e The Hilton Double Tree which we stayed at for the last 2 nights(12th December) after picking up relatives from LAX.;4
Fine hotel. Near the airport, reasonably priced and a great dining area. Staff were friendly and helpful and very attentive to our needs. We arrived late into the morning and were well taken care of by the staff. Have no problem recommending this hotel for any type of traveller. So hats off to the Four Points LA.;4
Convenient spot near LAX.  Hotel has an airport shuttle plus the rental car agencies are close by and easy to get to. They have a great deal on parking if you are from the area and plan to leave a car at LAX.  Try to request the West Tower because the rooms are nicer.  The East Tower is renovated, but does not have central air and rooms are dingy in spite of updated features.;3
For a quick-stop hotel right by a major airport, this place delivers the goods. Nice staff, clean and quiet (surprisingly so!) and VERY conveniently located. The hotel is a bit dated but otherwise commendable.;4
This hotel is conveniently located close to the airport and there is a budget rental car right across the street.  Unfortunately, the room (#714) was not completely clean when I arrived.  The beds were made but the bathroom was not.  Dirty towels were still in the tub so I called down and they sent housekeeping up.  This should not happen and I hope its an isolated event and for this reason I'm giving the property a poor score.  Otherwise, the beds were comfortable as usual for a Four Points where I frequently stay when I need a room near an airport.  Reasonable value for decent product. WIfi was free and fast.;2
"after traveling for 14 hours from london its always best to get to your hotel as soon as possible when you land which is why we stayed near the airport. there is a free shuttle bus but  look for it to say ""four points "" not sheraton this hotel was a little dated and appeared a little unloved, lots of scuff marks  on the walls the lift doors scratched. the food offerings come from the same kitchen so why is there a discrepancy in the price you pay when eating in the bar in comparison to the restaurant? overall it was an ok  place for the first nights sleep";3
"The hotel is convenient to LAX and has a free shuttle.  The layout is a bit odd; the hotel rooms must have had exterior doors in the past, but the building was modified to add interior hallways.  Each room has a window which looks out to the hallway.  The hallway has windows the look out to the city.  The room was clean, comfortable, and nicely updated.  There is not much around to walk to for food aside from restaurants within other hotels, however burgers and beer within the 4-Points bar were tasty.  There is a Burger King nearby, and Avis Car Rental (among others) is a short walk from the hotel.";4
We were so pleased with this hotel.  It was right around the corner from the Avis Rental pick-up site.  It was far enough away from the airport so that plane noise was not an issue.  The price was right!  Our room was spacious and had two queen beds.  We had plenty of space to move around.  The room was very quiet and the beds were wonderful.  The hotel has a pool but we didn't use it.  The parking is fine.  You can valet park if you wish.  The restaurant was excellent with a nice selection of menu items.  There is also a breakfast buffet.  The check-in and out were handled quickly and professionally.  The Internet is free.  I guess my only complaint is that the lobby is a little boring. The hotel is not as classy as the Sheraton down the street, but the price is much better.;4
My wife and decided to go on a weekend trip without kids starting in Los Angeles. We thought the LAX area would be a good place to stay so we were in the middle of the area.   We were given two double beds in a room with a busted shower head, which is hilarious.   There were loud partyers throughout the floor. This was definitely more like a Super 8 motel versus a hotel. The place is rundown and I would not recommend staying here. When I asked about getting a room with one queen or king bed, the staff member basically scoffed at me they were too busy and made me feel like he was doing me a favor.;2
I'm an SPG member and am a fan of their properties. But unfortunately, Four Points hotels seem to be the bottom of the barrel for SPG.   I'll make it this short and simple.  Pros 1. Free wifi.  2. Close to LAX.  3. Car rental available in lobby and across the street. 4. Free shuttle to and from LAX every 20 mins.   Cons 1. Halls smell like a sweaty locker room.  2. Parking is $19.00.  3. Stains, stains everywhere (walls, carpet, curtains).  4. Bathroom was remodeled halfway (they left old tub).  5. Horrible paint job on walls.  Lobby is nice but is not indicative of anything above the lobby.;1
"I've stayed at this hotel at least a half dozen times over the last 4 or 5 years (only because it's usually been the cheapest) and unfortunately, I've never had a great stay that I would recommend this place to anyone.  It's owned by the same guy/company that owns the SLS hotel and other ""fancy"" restaurants in L.A. so when they recently (and finally!) renovated this place last year, I was hopeful that it would finally improve the place (which I used to joke had sandpaper bedsheets).  Unfortunately, the old saying that you can't slap lipstick on a pig rings true here.  To be sure, the rooms are much nicer than they were before and while the bathrooms are at least more up-to-date, I still can't shake that motel feeling when staying here.  You'll get you're comfy Starwood bed but";3
We like the hotel. It is very close to LAX, and the airport shuttle is very convenient and frequent. The staff are courteous and helpful. The room is nice and comfortable, and the layout is convenient.;5
The hotel is huge and in good shape. Clean rooms but a little uncomfortable beds.  We got a room with a lot of AC noise (coming from the hallway, which is kind of mysterious for me) but they changed quickly when we pointed out the problem.  The price was OK ($90/night) but no breakfast included. I would not have paid more, either.  As mentioned in other reviews the parking was full, full. I found a spot but it was almost the last. And for a hefty $19/day!  The location is actually fine for touring the Los Angeles area. We went downtown, Long Beach, Santa Monica and it worked fine. And it was certainly cheaper than more centric locations.;3
"This is a good solid airport hotel. Avoid the ""Traditional Rooms"". They have a window, but the window looks out on to a corridor where people walk past to get to their rooms. It's kind of like a motel-style, but the corridor isn't open to the elements, but enclosed / carpeted etc. The other rooms are better.   Note, the airport pick up bus (which is light blue) doesn't say ""Sheraton"" on the destination display, but ""Four Points"". It's also the same bus for the Westin. So I think it says ""Westin / Four Points"", and I was looking out for ""Sheraton"" and that goes to a different hotel.   There is a handy Burger King across the road, if you're needing something easy after a long flight....";3
I reached at around 11 pm at the hotel and I tried to park but no spots were available so I decided to go check in after temporarily parking at the curb in front of the lobby!  Checked in and I asked about parking and the clerk said just go thru the gates and I'll find parking! The clerk didn't mention anything about a parking charge which I expected there would be since it's a airport hotel. Well I reached the so called armed gates and it said $19 for parking for hotel guests and 26 for others but since I was not informed at check-in about parking rates I was under the impression that it's complimentary so I took the ticket and the arm opened for my car to enter the parking lot. Much to my dismay I was stunned there was no parking spot available I drove around up a ramp, down a;3
Our recent stay at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX airport location was great. Minutes from the airport on their free shuttle. The front desk staff was quick and efficent and helpful. Both restuarants at the resorts served a wonderful dinner/drinks and buffet breakfast. Would diffently stay there again.;5
Had a lovely large room on high floor, offering excellent views of airport and jets, which were audible but not too much. The bar seemed quite lively, as was pool. Staff were very friendly and professional, but very much a place for a bed and not much else. Would stay again if needed to using spg points, but if paying would probably look at nearby Homewood Suites.;3
This is my second time here, great service and location.   The only concern was the parking lot was used for airport parking and there was no parking for hotel guests. The parking situation needs some attention.;4
In reading the reviews, I too would stay here. I booked based on Starwood reputation. Both are wrong. Phil Baxter uses alot of words but takes no action. We had two stays, both in transit for international connections. Response to concerns were met with wordy and incorrect emails. Second stay was in a filthy room . I do not expect this from any hotel let alone a Starwood property.Too much to mention but hopefully pics and communication withStarwood customer service will mend and maintain the customer relationship. Stay somewhere else.;2
Stayed in Sheraton Lax for a night then switched to this amazing place! The price was 1/4 of sheraton but the stay was 100times better. So if you are in between these two properties I would say pick four points with eyes closed!    Pros Easy parking and valet options Very comfy California king bed Upgraded bathroom with great supplies Everything is clean and new Great starwood preferred guest treatment  Cons The reception staff could be friendly and easy they seemed sick of being there..;5
I stayed in this hotel on my way back from the UNFCCC meeting in Warsaw, Poland, as recommended by a friend working with Delta Airline. I was right. It's was better than my previous hotel I used to stay in LA. They provide free transport to the terminal and the hotel is very clean. I will recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to stay close to the airport. The hotel rate is also reasonable.;4
I was stayed here for only 2 days so it isnt complete review. But for this 2 days I didnt find anything to complain about. Our room was small, but clean, comfortable enough and cheap. There are shuttle arives from airport to pick you up and deliver back. It is free as I remember. Well, nice hotel for couple days if you need to stay near airport. Although, if you plan to stay in LA for long I would not reccomend it - not this hotel, but any hotel in this area - since there are nothing to do near airport, and it is far away from all places to visit.;4
This hotel is one of the best we have stayed at during our trips to the US.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and can not do enough for you including advising you on things to do if you have a day to spare.  Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a great place to stay near the airport.;5
When flying long distance or internationally we usually have to fly out of LAX which wouldn't be so bad if we didn't live so far from the airport.  Using the Four Points Hotel, Park n Fly package is the way to beat hassling the traffic, get a good nights sleep before our flight, be close to the airport terminals, and park our car in a safe and inexpensive location.  Because we don't live close to LAX we are never sure how much time to allow for travel from Riverside county to LAX.  Traffic is soooo unpredictable. The shuttle to and from the airport took a lot of the stress away by getting us right to our terminal and picking us up upon on arrival.  Will definitely use the Four Points hotel when travel out of LAX.;5
I attended two daytime conferences at this hotel - most recently, in October. Both conferences were attended by less than 200 people. Both times, the hotel ran out of parking, had people park in areas that were not real spaces, and sent attendees to park at other hotels. It would help if management warned attendees that there is not enough parking and that they should carpool. I cannot comment on the hotel rooms because I did not stay overnight.;3
LAX Four Points Sheraton is a great hotel when traveling through LAX. The staff is friendly and helpful. One staff member in particular named Julian went above and beyond my expectations as a customer and was extremely polite, helpful and very professional. The staff can make or break any experience and Julian could nt have been a better representative for the Sheraton brand.;4
Have stayed a number of times pre/post flight. Very nice hotel and we were equally pleased this time. Comfy beds, free wifi, friendly staff, great location. Great price for hotel room and free parking. The only complaint this visit was waiting for the shuttle after our flight. Shuttles are supposed to run every 15 minutes, but we waited 35 minutes.   Very convenient for pre/post flights.;5
Depressing brown decor in hallways and low lighting also seems dangerous.  The room is old and not enough outlets.  The bathrooms are clean but tile et al is dingy.  Bed not real comfortable.  Breakfast was ok but the waiter did not take notes and placed mushrooms in my food which i did not ask for and I do not like.  Check-out took too long as only one person at the desk.  The manager came out to help on one issue and went then went to the back office instead of helping out the rest of the folks on line.  Not very customer friendly!;2
Close proximity to LAX, friendly, helpful staff, two restaurants with some healthy menu options, comfy beds, heater/air-conditioning fan provides just the right amount of white noise, and the fitness room has a ballet barre!  Great value for this location.;5
"It is located near the airport and there is Free shuttle ride that goes around the hotel vicinity 24/7 so Transfer wont be a problem. I have been here several times since Our company chose this hotel for our Lay Overs in LA. The staff in the CONCIERGE desk/ transport have always been accommodating and helpful anytime consistently.. BUT the STAFF in the RECEPTION where you check In/ check out, most of them are RUDE, INCOnsiderate, UNHELPFUL as if they are not happy being there and are not accommodating CONSIDERING that it is HOTEL RECEPTION. I have observed several Unpleasant Acts towards others and I actually PERSONALLY EXPERIenced the ""coldness"" and RUDEness  of some  REceptionists. But HOtel Phone Operators where you can relay other concerns such as messages etc Are always";3
I love how your email says contact for prompt assistance but I called and got the runaround now I've been waiting the entire day for a call back.   I stayed at your hotel for one night but was charged for parking for 2 days ?   This is not the service I expect from a SPG property;3
"I reserved a room under the hotel's ""24-hour check in, check out"" policy, which allows you to check in at any time of day and check out at the same time the next day. While convenient for air travelers, it is a hassle to book because you must reserve a room that costs $119 or more, which means that you aren't eligible for many of the hotel's special rates, and you have to trust that the staff will code your reservation correctly.  Initially, when I filled out the online form available at the hotel's website to request this, no one responded, so I had to call the hotel directly to verify that it had been done correctly. You must also add $19 + tax per day to park your car, so you will pay more than $150.00 per night with all taxes.  I also participated in the ""Breakfast for a";3
A very comfortable hotel located right next to LAX.  Had all the necessary travel amenities and the staff was competent and friendly. It is a great spot for a stop between flights or for quick visits to Century City, West LA areas.;4
The staff and management team at this location are professional and caring. This is my 11th time staying at this location. It surpasses every one of my expectations. The bell staff is friendly and very attentive to your needs. I noticed a lot of airline crews at this locations and that only verifies that even the top airlines consider this hotel to be quality. I hope that my stellar praise for this location does not allow me to miss out and enjoy the reasonable rates, great cafe and friendly service because of it being fully booked in the future. I highly recommend this hotel and its staff. All my best, Mike Attardi- SPG Lifetime Gold Member;5
Hotel is OK.    Maid left window cracked, which I did not realize, usually no big deal but the airplaine noise and traffic noise was pretty bad as a result.  World's worst, slowest, most confused elevators.  Nice beer selection.  Friendly staff.;3
We have had the displeasure of using this hotel for a recent stay in the LAX area at the end of an 11 day trip to California. Check in was fine, quick enough, if a little too casual. The information at check was basic but sufficient.  The car we had parked had been done so throughout our trip to California - all for free, but alas despite one of those locations being in LAX the four points thinks for some reason its justified in its pricing.  The car park is busy, it wouldn't be as busy if they didn't have spaces used up by the in house car rental company, nor those guests who stay and fly - the justification for the daily rate simply doesn't fly, especially as being a guest only saves you a few bucks over being a visitor!  The room we had was at the back of the hotel, it was;2
Excellent customer service. Loved all the staff. Our Waiter Jesus Gutierez was very kind and helpful. Rooms were clean, some things like light fixtures were old and rusty. Food was great but breakfast overpriced. Overall very pleased.;4
I found my stay at the Four Points to be very clean and comfortable.  The food and room service was excellent.  If you wanted to go down to their bar/restaurant it was a inviting atmosphere.   Perfect location next to the airport with plenty of parking.  The staff was courteous and hospitable.  I have stayed here every time I'm in LA for work and will continue to.;5
Whenever we have an early morning flight out of LAX we reserve the Park Sleep Fly package at Four Points Sheraton LAX for the night before. We enjoy dinner at the Brew Bar and then our comfortable room, while leaving our car parked at the hotel for the duration of our trip. Shuttle to the airport runs every 15 minutes and allows us a stress free start to our trip, not having to worry about traffic on an early morning drive to the airport.  When we return from our trip we board the hotel shuttle from the airport back to the hotel, jump in our car and complete the drive home.  The comfortable beds and room amenities are an added bonus.;5
Very close to the airport with frequent and efficient shuttles. Literally surrounded by car rental agencies.  Exceptionally attentive staff both when making reservations as well as on site. I have stayed at this property on a regular basis for years. Response is very fast if there is any issue such as a burned out light bulb.;5
This is a very large hotel with easy access to the airport.  There is a shared shuttle that stops at the Westin first when being picked up at the airport, so you have to really watch for this shuttle bus.  Check in was quick and simple.  The lobby is large with a lot of seating around, and it has a nice view of the outdoor pool.  There’s a bar and restaurant within the hotel that has good food.  Service is outstanding here!  There is also a Burger King across the street.  The hotel has two elevator lobbies – one in the front of the hotel and one in the back.  We had room 888, which was located in the back of the hotel.  It was nice to watch the planes land at night.  This room was a suite that had a small living room and a king sized bed.  The bed was extremely soft and;4
Very nice and very pleased with the service and the friendly front desk people. I will surely reserve my next stay at your Hotel.  Thanking you again for the wonderful time!!! I moved to Phoenix from the area just East of your Hotel several years ago, so I do know the area. The choice to come to your Hotel was very rewarding.   I have already given very good reports to all my family and friends both in the Los Angeles area and also here in Phoenix. Thanking you agein for the very pleasant stay at your Hotel!!;5
This place is old and dirty. I don't think we will ever stay at a Four Point hotel again.   I can't believe that the reviews are as good as they are. Maybe there are room in a different section of the hotel that are nicer, but we stayed on the 7th floor in something that looked like an old motel room.  We stayed here bc of the Sheraton name, but we will stick with the more reliable brands next time.;1
I had an overnight layover at LAX and the night's stay at the Fourpoints was perfectly adequate for my needs though not excellent. The pluses for staying here is the free shuttle to and from the airport, SPG floor, free wifi, and very comfortable beds. The downsides for me was that housekeeping didn't provide the free water as included in the rate (or any water whatsoever), and the coffee facilities were lacking (bad news for early morning flyers). For a good rate, it's best to overlook these details as the staff were very nice and the room was a very good value.;4
Sevice with a smile! Late night checkin, tired and ready for bedtime after a long day with family in the L.A. area. Ready to catch a early morning flight.  There he was, Tyron Wright, making it all happen without any hold up or delays.  Check-in was smooth and friendly and more importantly....Friendly Service with a Smile.  GReat Job Tyron!!;5
We want to let the management know of the ways Ms. Martha D. has always treated us each time we visited. She has a welcoming beautiful smile with her admirable hospitality attitude. We have many other choice of hotels around but she makes it home for us here. We want you to join us in congratulating and encouraging her to keep up the good job. The rooms are clean and reasonably priced;4
I recently stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton, LA the rooms were clean and neat, but the hallways were dirty and looked rather worn. The staff was helpful but when I asked for a small refridgerator for my room it was never delivered. (needed to store meds). The extra charge for parking which is added to your bill is bit too much I think $15.00 per day..If you need to use a computer be prepared to pay $4.25 per minute. All these small charges added up which made a reasonalby priced hotel a bit more expensive.;3
We had a death in family, Four points was very convenient to our relatives and accessible to the services. Due to LAX incident (shooting @ LAX airport) the staff was very accommodating and we able to make the return flight back with ease.;5
As business travelers, we have enough to worry about, without worrying about our accommodations.  This property is very accessible when I land, clean rooms, and the staff is accommodating, and pleasant. I do recommend  this property too anyone visiting the area;5
Sent on business, this property made my 1st trip to LA memorable and easily adjustable. Starting with Tyron Waight at the front desk, to the restaurant staff that made my wait to register easy and comfortable. I will be making more trips and this hotel will be my first stop on arrival.;5
"This is the 2nd time I have stayed at this hotel and I have to say it was a much better stay than before. Aside from having to wait nearly 45 minutes for a crib on the night we checked in (after I had specifically requested one weeks in advance, and had been told by the front desk receptionist upon arrival that it would ""be delivered soon,"" and being told 10 more minutes after calling the front desk when it was closer to 20), it was a great stay.  The room was a nice size with a large king bed. And the pillows! Sooo comfortable. I wish I had pillows like that.   We rented a car from Budget (which is right across the street) and didn't have to pay the parking fee...which is something like $20 a night. I don't know if that's normal, if it was because we're SPG members, or someone";5
When picking p my wife from a european flight she had several weather delays & missed flights enroute.  What should have been a 1630 arrival ultimately was 00:40 AM. After an almost 23-hour odyssey the last thing I could do to her (or ME) was to drive 2-3 more hours at 0-dark-30 down I-5 home to San Diego. Thus this hotel came up with a good last minute offer I gladly took as 4 rooms were left at mid-day.  I decided to go up early and wait in the room relaxing until her flight got in.  The rooms were of typical Sheraton quality with serious double glass windows and insulation that blocked-out the overhead airplane noise from LAX only a quarter mile away.  We slept like the dead and awoke the next day ready to face the LA freeway  system. Give this hotel a serious look if you;4
My stay was amazing! I received the best service possible! The property is great and the staff is amazing! Although I interacted with several members of the staff, I only recall Tyron at the front desk by name. My A+ review stems from the fact that I had some issues with my new apartment being ready and they let me store my luggage for several additional days, even after I had moved to a more conveniently located property (my job was an hour away). The staff is great! Thanks so much for your help!;5
If you should ever need a Hotel near LAX Airport please stay at the Four Points By Sheraton and ask for Tyron Waight. This guy is all about customer service and make sure the guest is well taken care of. He does his job with a smile, great attitude, friendly, go's high and low to make sure your well attend to.;5
The hotel staff is wonderful here. We had great customer service from Christian at the Customer Services desk and we were blessed with great conversation and wonderful service from Jesus Gutierrez while enjoying the breakfast buffet. We would stay here again! :);4
The hotel is convenient and close to the airport.  The staff was friendly and check in just ok.  The rooms are a bit worn and tired but overall, it's an ok property. Parking is pricey but I guess that's par for the area.;3
"I booked a standard room through a package and overall it was fine.  The GOOD: friendly front desk free wifi free shuttle to airport location offers $5 roundtrip transportation to the beach/shopping nice lobby/pool/restaurant areas clean quiet reasonably price roomservice  The BAD: I was in a standard room which was apparently hidden in a hallway behind an ""exit"" sign door and it was a bit confusing and frightening at first.  I made it to my room and tried to turn the light switch on which didn't work so I hunt in the dark for another light and it didn't work either...finally I find the bathroom light that works...inconvenient but it happens I suppose.   Once the lights were on I try to order room service with the menu provided and I was told they were out of everything I picked";3
A precise review by Maria below regarding staff here at Four Points. We too found all staff very competent and friendly, willing to make one feel at home. In particular, one of the first faces of the hotel is Farooque, who greeted us at our car, made us feel welcome and was extremely helpful with our luggage issues. We met more operations staff when our flight was delayed, and all were proactive in seeing that all guests' needs were being met. Our stay was comfortable and good value, supported by solid F&B choices. Would stay again, without hesitation. Thanks team.;4
Many stays in many different hotels around many different airports have educated me not to have too many great expectations. Thus it is with Four Points by Sheraton on Airport Blvd. I did remember that there is a Burger-King right across the road - free tip. The price at 4 Points was good and I booked 2 nights.  The cost of car parking - we came in two different vehicles, each $19 plus $1.90 tax per night - adds an eye-watering 80 bucks to the equation. On a busy Friday and Saturday evening with a full car park that must add five or six grand straight to the bottom line - what a profit center!! And at that price it might have been nice to have wider spaces.  Now, the hotel - reception was friendly and quick, despite being busy with some sort of convention.. We asked for and got;3
My daughter and I were on our way to China and flew to LA the day before.  We stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to the airport.  We were very happy with our stay, but what made it extra special were the employees at this hotel, from beginning to end, they were friendly, efficient and very well trained.  Congratulations to the hotel's management!!!;5
Hotel was adequate, the room was clean and bed comfortable.  Bathroom small, not much water pressure.  Nothing too bad about it all.  Shuttle to/from airport makes it convenient.  Staff accommodating.  Room off hallway, so the only window was to a hall - no privacy or no light: your choice. (I just don't like that configuration)  Public spaces could be spruced up.  Wallpaper torn, just felt a bit worn out.    Chose it because a conference I attended was in that hotel.  There are others nearby that I'll try next time.  I won't stay here again.;3
My partner and I had an early flight so thought it would easier to stay at LAX.  The Room was a little outdated and had bit of a 'musty' smell about it, but was very clean.  Location to the airport is good.  We didn't hear any noise from the planes all night.  Bed was very comfortable.  The sports bar is great and the food + service was really good.  We would stay here again.;3
We made a very last minute decision to stay in the LAX area for 3 nights, and the Four Points had a good rate available.  Complementary wifi was a big selling point, and the room rate meant we overlooked the $19/day car parking charge.  Check-in could have been quicker - this is a big hotel with a relatively small reception.  The front desk guy was trying to do 3 things at once so didn't mention the different car park rates for guests and non-guests.  Work for Jetblue - they get served quicker!  Room is clean, a decent size, flat screen tv, wifi, nice bathroom and amenities and a bed I wanted to take home.  However I forget the best bit about Four Points: beer!  Having had a great experience with local brews earlier in the year at Four Points Tucson Airport, a good few different;5
"Ok, this is is a mixed review. We booked on line and needed a hotel near the airport for a conference. We were only staying a few days. Hotel on line looked fine and since it was affiliated with the Sheraton, we figured it would be fine. We arrived around 10pm and free shuttle from airport to hotel was fine. Entered lobby and check in was fine, lobby area looked pretty nice. Took elevator to the room and then as we were walking to the room our room number actually had us exit the corridor to an outside hallway. Found room and hallway was an outside corridor; our room faced the outside and could hear the planes coming and going. Only window was to the corridor. Hard to describe but felt like we were in a motel with everyone walking by our window. Got inside room and while decent";3
Hi this is a good hotel Near airport godd to use when arive or depart to LA. It´s clean and people on the hotel are very helpful. I will use this hotel again i´m in Los Angelses and can recommend other to do;3
The room and bathroom are dated.  The ceiling is very low.  They upgraded me to a pool view room and guess what the only thing I can see was the roof.  The elevator is very small and the door closes too quickly - you need to be a Ninja to get in or out.  We dined at the Comfort and the foods were tasteless.  I know LAX is generally lack of good hotels but just another one was crossed out on my list.;2
The hotel location is excellent for travelers. it is convenient to LAX. You can avoid the unpredicted traffic jam and catch your flight with no worries. It provides shuttle bus to the airport every 15 minutes. The hotel check-in is speedy and efficient. Rooms are clean and the service is great.;5
"The customer service is excellent; Martin and Trish at the front desk went above and beyond the call of duty to attend to my every need in an expeditious manner with a constant smile. The room was beautiful and spacious and the bathroom much larger than the one at home. Everything was clean.";4
We stayed the day at Four Points LAX as we arrived on a cruise early in the morning and our flight to Australia did not leave until late evening, we had a shuttle to LAX  from the cruise terminal and the free shuttle for Four Points picked us up at the arrivals area and took us to the Hotel where we had a very relaxing day ,very pleasant before a long flight ,the free shuttle also returned us to LAX when we needed to return, definitely would go back again if needed;4
The hotel staff were extremely welcoming and happy to answer questions.  The room was very clean and had plenty of space.  The dining room was nice and the food was good (especially if you like cheese burgers as big as your head, which i do:).  The airport shuttle was prompt and the driver was friendly.  Overall a great experience.;5
The bed was soooooo comfortable. I slept very well,and the room was very nice and clean. Thank you for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. I would definetly stay here again so I could experience the spa/ pool amenities with my family.;5
I'd like to recognize Jazmin, who checked me in. she was so nice and very accommodating. The airport it self was very nice, close to where I needed to be. Might could have better, or should I say more parking was difficult to find spots, especially for $19/day. Overall, I had a great experience. Please do something special for Jazmin she really is great!!!;5
We have stayed here many times the night before an early AM flight.  Parking is easy, a lot behind the hotel, staff is always helpful and the bar and lobby area a nice spot to sit and relax and have a beer.  Rooms are comfortable and clean.  And in the morning, a quick shuttle to the airport.;5
Close to Budget where I always rent, easy to get back and forth to LAX.  Dinner at main dining room was quite nice with appetizers a respectable Pinot Noir and a thick salmon filet done just right under the broiler.  Staff was attentive and the cappuccino most welcome first thing in the morning.  We will return.;4
I can't take the Asia to USA East coast journeys in one go anymore (I'm 53 yrs old) and need an easy and stress free one night LAX stay over to break the journey ! Excellent.  So close to LAX.  Regular shuttle.  I always request a room where I can see the planes land (needs to be from floors 5-7).  Very good price.  FREE WI-FI. I will continue to use Four Points for sure. And there's a Denny's, Carl's Jr. & Burger King all within easy walking distance and a liquor store right across the road for some beers etc. in my room ! Unbeatable !;5
The hotel itself was nice and clean!   We were there only for a day before traveling back to Asia in a long flight, we wanted to have a nice restful night before flying over 24 hrs.  The rooms are nice nothing really special just a nice 3-4 stars hotel.    The parking lot is quite a hassle in in the back of the building and is huge, if you come with lots of luggage like we did... you will not manage to do it all in one trip.  The shuttle bus at the airport took 45 minutes to take us to the hotel due to traffic on our way back to the airport was not as bad.;3
This hotel is situated right next to most of the rental car companies, so it was very convenient for returning our car and catching an early morning flight.  Surprisingly I could not hear the planes from our room.  The hotel was decent but nothing special.  Supposedly our room had been recently renovated, but it didn't look like it.  The parking fee seemed expensive for this hotel, and the parking lot was pretty full.  We were lucky to find a parking spot when we returned from dinner.;3
The entire staff, from Check-in (especially) to restaurant to lounge is superb! Helpful, efficient, courteous & real pros, they make a stay at the LAX Four Points very enjoyable. You can't beat the location, the staff & the Wednesday eve beer tasting!;5
"I've stayed at this hotel off and on for 10yrs or more now, going in and out of LAX. My two choices are the Sheraton down the street if I want posh & soulless (incredibly underpriced for as nice as it is) and FourPoints if I want fun and funky and very cheap.   As others have pointed out, LAX neighbourhood is not LA proper and kind of a grubby weird industrial urban zone; you are not on Rodeo Drive, but this hotel isn't priced like you are.    Is a bit more cleaned up than it was 5-8yrs ago though, believe me that.  You can usually get a room here for $100 or less, and is great for families or budget travelers.  When younger, I'd lived in apartments smaller than the suites here.   Just ginormous. Great parking package, particularly the park-and-fly.  Yes it costs to park here,";4
I would rate this hotel much higher than any hotels around this area. It has all that you need for business travel and the staff here are simply THE BEST!! Tyron Waight at the SPG counter is super helpful and he really does go the extra mile to make sure you have an amazing stay. Total Awesomeness!!!;5
We checked in here in the early hours of the morning after being bumped from our flight home to Brisbane.  The rate quoted was cheaper than most in the area.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  We received an upgrade to a Junior Suite which was appreciated.  The room had very noisy old style air conditioning.  The room was accessible so the shower was set up for those in a wheelchair and rather difficult to change for someone not needing that type of shower.  I feel overall the hotel is quite in need of a refurbishment.  It is quite dated and not up to the standard of others in the area.  We stayed also at the Sheraton Gateway and the Marriott during our 6 nights in the LAX area.  I don't think I would go back to Four Points again as there are better around. I particularly don't;3
From the beginning of the venue selection process until the final conclusion of our Reunion Party, the entire staff of the Four Points Sheraton LAX Hotel were excellent in every phase of the event.  Fred Groth & Kathy Hansen in The Catering Department & Group Sales Director Ferdinand Castro, were consistently helpful, available and friendly each step of the way.  The Front Desk, Bell Desk, Restaurant, Bar, Catering & Housekeeping Staffs were all very attentive to our needs.  The hotel location was perfect, access was easy from every direction, and the California Ballroom easily accommodated the 450 people that attended our reception event.  The variety and quality of the food was outstanding, and the beautiful rotating ice sculpture was a big hit with everyone at the party.  One;5
The hotel was much better than I expected. I was skeptical about booking here at first because of the parking fee and the bad reviews but turns out the hotel was great. The room was very comfortable. The fitness center was clean and spacious. The staff were very helpful. I loved everything about this hotel. The best thing about FourPoints LAX is the bed. I had the best sleep at the hotel. I even paid extra to have late checkout at 6PM just so I could sleep a little longer.;5
Single nights stay, upgraded room, fairly dated but clean-ish. Location is ideal, staff all super nice and very helpful. Breakfast included with stay which was great!  Mini fridge in room was a nice touch, gym looked good but didn't use it.  Shuttle from LAX was nice.  Stay again, sure but I do prefer hotels with a lounge for obvious reasons.;4
I've stayed at many hotels by LAX in my travels, including the Westin (which should be a 4 star but isn't in LA) and the Hilton (which looks like a 4 star but has no customer service ethic). I was pleasantly surprised when I landed at this Four Points on Airport Blvd LAX.  I was with an extremely large group of musicians and festival people.  I was treated with the utmost respect from the time of check in.  Walking in the door, the lobby was clean, updated and inviting.  Check in was very smooth.  Walking in my room was nothing short of a 4 star experience.  Big comfortable clean bed with 4 giant fluffy pillows on each bed (I am a pillow hog).  Housekeeping was friendly and timely when I called to get extra towels.  AAA rate was budget friendly, and included parking.  Highly;5
"My overall experience staying at this place was okay, but there were a couple of things that rather annoyed me. HOT WATER. The shower in the bathroom never seemed to actually HAVE any. Although I made sure the water temperature indicator was on H, the water temp never rose above being (barely) lukewarm. I literally shivered my way through each miserable shower I took while staying at this hotel. I thought that perhaps the C and H water indicators had been reversed so I double checked but the cold water worked just fine. Something else I thought sucked was the fact that I had to pay for parking. I stayed at the hotel to attend a conference so I quite literally just drove to the hotel and ""parked"" my car for 2 days - never leaving the lot. I really hate it when hotels charge";3
When I made my reservation the reservation agent quoted me the price for 2 people and said breakfast was included.  She said nothing about a parking fee.  When I got to the hotel the desk clerk said my parking fee was $17.  The sign in the parking lot said the fee is $18.  On my bill the next morning I was charged $19 plus $1.90 tax on the parking fee.  We went to the restaurant and told the waitress what we needed to get the free breakfast.  She said the desk should have given us a voucher when we checked in.  They did not.  She called to see if we were supposed to have a free breakfast.  She came back to our table and was very apologetic and said that the desk said we do not get free breakfast.   I left the restaurant to call the reservation number I called the night before to;2
This place us awful....1960's decor, small cramped bathrooms and on our first night they didn't even bother to clean the room. Parking is awful as well....no room left if you get back late---this after paying an extra $19.95/night to park a car. Awful, awful, awful. It's close the the airport...so that's good.;1
"I got a great price on this room through AAA and was very happy upon checking in.  However, at that point, I was informed about the $19 a night parking fee.  I don't know if it's just me, but that is ridiculous.  I've never been charged a parking fee as a guest of a hotel.  Upon stating that it would have been nice to know this upfront, the woman at the front desk stated that third party booking sights do not have to disclose that info.  I then went and tried to book a room on the hotel's website, and there was no mention of this fee either, even under the link, ""for a detailed list of all charges, taxes and fees"".  I feel that this was intentionally deceptive and since I've read numerous reviews of this hotel that do not mention the parking fee, I wanted to share this with";4
the room 464 where i stayed on Oct 3rd is very small and the air conditioner was very noisy, the doorcard was not ready for a long time and we were kept waiting without any help.  My 2nd stay on Oct5-7 is a little bit better as the room is bigger, but i still couldn't feel the good service provided by the hotel staffs.;3
The staff at four points was professional and friendly. They made us feel at home away from home. Kudos to the front desk staff and to you waiter Jesus, who provided us with excellent customer service!;5
After a long day, I was pleased to have a warm and jovial welcome at check in. Tyron and his colleague, I'm sorry I did not get her name, engaged in pleasant banter with us as my colleague and I checked in.  Nice start to my stay.;5
The big hotels around LAX have a reputation for being lackluster, so after a recent one-night stay at the Four Points I was pleasantly surprised.  Of the hotels right near the airport, it was reasonably priced, clean and well-maintained.  Throughout our stay the staff was very friendly, had a great attitude, and handled our requests promptly.  The hotel appeared to have been recently renovated, and everything in our room looked clean and new.  Our room was in the west tower, which I recommend requesting.  We sprung for a junior suite (well worth it) which was absolutely huge, and the room was well-lit, well-appointed and everything worked properly. The hotel offered free wi-fi which worked well.  The bed was comfortable (although the pull-out couch was lousy) and noise from the;4
My Cousin and I were in town for our other cousin's 99th birthday! This was our first stay at a Four Points. We were in LA for 5 days and  truly enjoyed our stay there. Everyone was cordial: maid, shuttle driver, gift shop cashiers, servers in both hotel restaurants, and front desk staff. My husband and I travel often and will make it a priority to stay at a Four Points next time!!!;5
Though only overnight before embarking on a vacation, our stay was very pleasant.  We were greeted cordially, the room was comfortable, we were attended very graciously by Patricia at breakfast and given a prompt trip to the airport.  This was our second stay at Four Points and it will continue to be our hotel of choice on future trips.  Stan J;5
I was at this hotel recently and as always got a warm welcome at check in. Although I was early at the hotel around 10 Amin the morning, despite their 2 pm check in policy, they gave me a nice room immediately. It was good for me as I was very tired after an early morning arrival in Los Angeles. Location is good as hotel provide airport shuttle almost every 15 minutes in either direction. Recommended;4
I will not stay here again.  It was clean and functional but I felt like I was sleeping in a closet.  Room was tiny and all of the space taken up with stuff.  No chair other than the desk chair.  I guess I am expected to sit or lay on the bed (nice bed) to unwind.  For the price I paid, I was expecting a little more civility.;3
Great to stay in for a night transiting through. Has 24 hour check in so that is very handy. Rooms basic but fine. We stayed with 2 adults and 2 kids. Very close to the airport. Airport shuttle frequent and easy to access. Pool good. Would recommend it.;3
The pool area is great. Sun for most of the day with heaps of space. The bar/restaurant is great with a wide range of beers available and friendly efficient staff. The gym facilities are good and overall the hotel is a nice environment to stay in. The hotel staff themselves are polite but not overly warm.;4
We had a stay  in LA for the last day of our holiday to Disney world in Florida and because this hotel has a 24 hour stay it was perfect for us. We arrived at 9.00pm and left at 9.00pm the next night to travel back to Sydney on an 11.45pm flight. We spent the day at the pool and had a wonderful lunch and a couple of drinks. We travelled with our 8 year old granddaughter and she had no trouble keeping amused in the pool area where we took advantage of the pool cabanas. Will definitely be staying at this hotel again especially on the last night of a trip where all the flights back to Sydney don't leave until after 10.00pm.;5
I was in LA for a couple of days and then heading to San Diego so needed to be close to the airport which made this hotel ideal. Check in was very pleasant thanks to the lovely woman at the counter. I regret not getting her name as she deserves special commendation for all of her advice and help. After check in I went up to my room and couldn't at first pinpoint what was off about the floor plan. I then entered my room and realized that all of the windows are outside the room (part of the hallway) and the faux window inside your room didn't lead to anything. If that sounds weird it's because it is. Some couldn't care less about a real window but I do. It was so bizarre to have a window that led to the hallway. Secondly, the cleaning staff left much to be desired. The coffee;3
My husband & I stayed here for one night (3rd hotel in 3 nights).  We've stayed here in the past before so knew what to expect.  I booked it on Hotwire.  To us it's fine for one or 2 nights, but not someplace I would stay long term.  Parking is $20 a night, so that adds to the room.  The rooms are on the smaller side and the bathroom was smaller still, however, room was clean & that's a big plus in our book.  Check in/out was quick & easy.  It is just a basic hotel to us and was adequate for a night.  I wouldn't book it on purpose as there are other hotels in the LAX area I'd rather stay at, but if got it via Hotwire or Priceline, I'd be fine with it.;3
"My experience at the Four Points-LAX was very good!  The room has comfortable beds, free Wi-Fi , and very nice soaps and shampoo; they also provide complimentary bottled water. The hotel is only a mile from LAX. Four Points has a shuttle to take you to your terminal.   There is a restaurant on property, but prices seem a bit high.     My wife and I stayed here for 1 night before departing LAX airport in the morning.  Our room (5th floor) seemed  of good quality.     The front desk staff were very good. Very professional, friendly, and helpful  .   Being so close to the airport we did not notice any problems with airport noise during our stay.    The  shuttle to the airport was continuous about every 20 minutes, and got us to our airline promptly   Overall, this was  a good stay";5
parking plus one nite stay in a top rated hotel was less than just parking elsewhere, and a lot less stressful.Being at the airport the nite before a trip as so not to have to stress about traffic and finding the parking lot and then having to wait for a shuttle to airport was just a great way too start a trip.;5
This is a great hotel to stay at. Besides value for money and location, the staff are exceptional. I am a platinum member with SPG and diamond with Hilton and appreciate being valued. So I give them 5 stars.;5
excellent hotel,we have used many times before on stop-over to Europe from Australia.the only downside is there was only 1 teabag,not every one drinks coffee and only 1 bottle of water ,but after ringing reception 2 tea bags were delivered to the room.lucky we bring our own supply of teabags.various local eateries within a 15 minute walk-so good location.;4
The overall package was fine for the situation.  The room was above average and clean, holding up the standard of a Four Points.  I would return to this motel under similar conditions.  The only concerns I had were more typical of the location.  I would prefer more than 20 minutes free parking to check in, and had to pay $12.00 for 45 minutes.  This is typical of highly populated areas in general and LA in specific.  It would have been nice to had at least a continental breakfast, but I also understand that I paid significantly less than the normal rate for a typical business customer.  Neither of these items were a show stopper, but someone used to a different area may be caught off guard.;4
We booked the Sheraton Four Points hotel for a one night stay due to unavailability of flights. It appeared a good choice by being a good brand and close to LAX with a shuttle service. Check in was handled well as was check out. Beyond that and the shuttle service, the experience was one to forget. The room was spacious but frankly was below the standard I expect from the Sheraton brand. The room was pretty shabby showing considerable wear and tear. Both my partner and I found the bed and pillows the most uncomfortable from several weeks of travel in the USA. The room was very noisy. We were constantly disturbed by slamming doors and people talking and moving about  in the corridors. The place just seemed to echo. Unless you could sleep through world war 3 this is not your place;2
I have stayed at 4Points Sheraton LAX a number of times.  The check-in process is consistently well structured and moves at a reasonable pace.  This particular time I was attended by Tyron Waight who demonstrated great customer facing awareness, professional demeanor and attentive to arriving guests needs.  I observed how personable he was with the guests ahead of me, which made me hope I would be processed by him -- which I was.  Tyron was diligent in determining my needs and efficiently completed my check-in.  I am completely satisfied with my room, the location, the view and Tyron's proficiency.  I appreciate the cleanliness of the premises, convenient parking and proximity to the airport (shuttle available).  Hoorah for Tyron and for the LAX operation(s).;4
I got assigned a room with facilities for the disabled. The room was very spacious. The shower facilities were specially designed with no bath tub. Save the scratches on the chair and the desk, the room was neat and clean. There was a microwave oven and small fridge. There was also complimentary bottled water.  Breakfast was not included, very typical for hotels close to the LAX Airport.  The in-house restaurant opened until midnight. There was a free shuttle to the airport. It was a decent stay.;4
I love this room, first off Tyron W at the front desk was helpful, cool, and I can say I got what I ask for. I love to take pics and I really only like high floors with any kinda view, and that's what that young man gave me. The end rooms are peaceful, clean, and big. Oh did I forget to the bed is comfortable. Yes! Ask for Tyron Waight. Enjoy;4
Hotel overall was good.  Rooms were dated tho and the light at my door didn't work.  Never told anyone to have them fix it though.  Door was hard to open the paint and frame stuck.  Food was decent - but it took me 5 minutes to place my order.  Staff was friendly.;3
After a 12hr flight from UK I just wanted somewhere to get my head down and bearings before collecting my fly drive car the next day.  Staff were friendly, room was clean and bed was comfortable. Pool seemed ok and agree with previous reviewer...the beer selection in the bar is amazing!!  I've lived in half the countries on the list and I've never heard/seen most of them before.  Only gripe was with only 1 of 2 computers in lobby working and you had to queue for ages;5
Good hotel, does what it says on the tin. We stayed the first and last nights of our holiday to be near the airport as we had a 14 hour journey. Hotel very close to the car rental Locations. The receptionist on the first night was a bit snappy. The receptionist on the second night was more professional.;4
if you want to judge a hotel by it's beer selection (hey, I could make an argument for that) this is a great place to stay. Otherwise, think they should put a little more effort into the property updates. Was probably a nice place to stay years ago, but now kind of old and run down. Will say the staff was very nice and service was good. When I hung up my wake up call three times they sent someone up to make sure I didn't oversleep. Would probably look elsewhere next time, but might stop back in the Four Points for a nice Stout.;2
"My experience at the Four Points-LAX was very near perfect!  The hotel has an updated... clean...friendly ambiance.  The room features comfortable beds, free Wi-Fi, newspaper, and very nice amenities; they even provide complimentary bottled water!  The proximity to LAX is very convenient; Four Points has a shuttle to take you to your terminal.  Although the planes fly quite nearby, the hotel was very quiet.  There is a restaurant on property, but prices seem a bit high.  Near the hotel are various other places to eat or get take-out.  There is a nice lounge with bar and ample seating.  I was extremely happy with my stay and will certainly return!";5
The property is average in style/maintenance but MORE than made up for it with over the top customer service.  Tyron Waignt helped ensure my stay was enjoyable and made me feel FIRST CLASS (Even though I had booked my room through a discount site).  If you are in the LAX area, I would recommend this above all others because of the commitment to customer service. Rooms were clean, bathroom is tiny and you cant operate in it without closing the door.  Gia Heller CEO of The National Business Experts & The Social Media Masters.;3
I didn't like the parking situation it's wasn't  enough spaced or all the cars so you have to park on a very tiny space it was even hard to get out of my car once it was parked . My room wasn't clean enough. I found hairs all over the bathroom floors. Room was very small for a king size bed.;3
If you are thinking this is going to be as nice as a Sheraton Hotel, think again.  It is a low end hotel, just above a motel.  Nothing bad to say - everything is clean and well run - just a pretty cheap place.;3
"Just a one night stay on our way home to the east coast after a Hawaiian vacation, but was very pleased with the stay.  Room was large, clean and beds were extremely comfortable. Quality toiletries and ultra clean bathroom. Close to LAX with convenient free shuttle service.  Front desk staff was super friendly at check-in which really made for a pleasant end to a very long day.  Had a late dinner in the full service restaurant, again, staff there, very professional and pleasant.  Food was excellent and menu was very ""Californian""  Overall excellent stay, got a great night's sleep and finished out the trip well rested. Could not hope for better!";5
Convenient, courteous we liked the little extras. We stay here when we fly from LAX.  It's close, it's reasonably priced, it's comfortable and they offer complementary bottles of water (READS - tired of overpaying for bottles of water).  Extended parking is available.  They often upgrade us (Thank you Mr Waight).  This particular bar & restaurant has great service, knowledgeable staff, great menu and beer selection.  Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail had an unexpected twist that delighted us. It was grilled, then chilled, and served with the perfect cocktail sauce.  Just right for a late night snack.  We will be back.  It's bookmarked in my GPS.;4
The breakfast service team are great especially mr Jesus Gutierrez and mrs patty. And everyone in the hotel   Are very friendly. And is very near to the airport which is highly recommended and the beaches r close by and the shuttle bus free and that is very handy.;5
The hotel isn't much of a luxury but meets our requirement for a good 3 nights stay in LA. We were fortunate we got the room facing the main road without sound disturbance. Room was cleaned nicely everyday and we left some tips for the housekeeping services for job well done.  The free internet connection was an added bonus. Convenient location, several small eateries within walking distance. Friendly front desk services and always with a smile to answer all our questions on the driving directions around. Small issue will be the parking, they should consider to add more parking spots. Other than that, nothing bad I could think of.  Definitely recommend to friends.;4
I got this booking through AAA, since it had the best value for me.  I stayed here 2 nights on a quick trip to LA.  It's nice since its really close to the airport and close to the 105 and 405.    The room was large and clean. The bathroom felt a little tiny though, and my shower wasn't quite working well, but it still worked.  The beds were soft and well just really comfortable!    There's two restaurants in the hotel, but I only tried the bar, Brewster's.  Amazing beer selection, and the food is pretty good.  And the wall's are lined with flatscreens, just perfect to watch football on.  Check in/check out was no problem at all.  Only gripe.  The parking lot is kind of small.  So if you end up coming back late from a night out... good luck trying to find parking, you'll end up;4
"After spending 2 weeks in Thailand at Starwood properties a( alot less expensive than 4 points property) we stayed a nite in L.A. on way home...non smoking room smelled smoky..wax was spilt all over carpet by night stand..load of cig. burns in blanket..they were nice and moved us up to a better room tho..and adjusted bill..just seems like they should give property a ""make over""..";2
"This hotel has a free shuttle from the airport.  But if you want to get there quickly, just take a cab--the shuttle stopped at least 8 times to pick up other passengers, and then drops guests off at the Westin before getting to the Four Points.  The ride took over 30 minutes.  I booked a traditional room on Travelocity for 3 nights, prepaid.  When I got to my room on the second floor, I noticed that there were crumbs on the floor, the bathroom had only one towel and no bath mat, and there was a buzzing sound from the light outside my window.  I went back to the desk, and asked for a different room.  They explained that the room I had booked was a ""traditional,"" and next time to book a higher room grade.  Room number 2 was better.  Except that when I turned on the AC, there was a";3
I left my handbook in hotel 2 weeks ago. When I e-mail to Four Points Sharaton LAX this week, I was really not in big hope the handbook can be found. But pleasant surprisingly, Julian, assistant front office manager, replied me next day asked for more details of when of where I left the handbook, after I told them details, they replied immediately that handbook was found. This is a Great Service, efficient and care of details. I love this hotel.;5
The next time we visit L.A. this is where we stay. Great location, just across the street from car rental return and free airport shuttle. Room was spacious, comfy bed, small fridge, clean and quiet. Hotel had an excellent gym and a nice outdoor pool. Lots of restaurants nearby and close to everything we wanted to do/see. Great hotel for the money.;4
"Years ago this was a horrible hotel, and they have done a superb remodel, so I gave it a shot. But the ""old"" Four Points still shows through with a lot of wear and tear. Most frightening were the ""jumpy"" elevators that felt unsafe to me and my clients. A few simple improvements in the rooms would go a long way, like actually having outlets near the bed, putting doors on the ""closets"" (that I guess used to be real closets, but they ripped out the doors, so you're staring at a rack and hangers?) and airing out/deodorizing the rooms that smell like smoke. I will say the staff was friendly and helpful. The food was OK, not great. I didn't expect much for a low-end hotel like this, but sorry to say it still wasn't up to par. Felt like a Holiday Inn Express. Hosted a meeting here and";2
"Monday night stuck at LAX because there are no seats on my flight home. ""Follow me"" I say to my two colleagues and we hop on the shuttle to the Four Points. Whoops! Only one room left - and nothing else at any other airport hotel that I'd be happy to stay at. But Tyron at the Front Desk suggests a rollaway bed will solve the problem. And it does. For a small fee we can keep the room until six the following evening which suits perfectly for our late evening flight home. I've used this hotel many times; it's handy to the airport yet remarkably quiet and the staff are great..";4
A very convenient stay when your flight leaves early to avoid the traffic congestion experienced at most hours in LAX.  We only stayed about 6 hours and did not use any of the facilities as we got up at 4 AM. Clean and large ,nicely furnished room. It was noisy from what appeared to be kids jumping on the floors above our room.;4
We had a 2 queen bed room on the 7th floor, views of LAX and surrounding car rental lots. The room was relatively quiet, hardly any aircraft noise, considering the close proximity to the airport.  We were allowed an early 10am check-in, for no extra cost. Our room was not ready when we arrived, so we checked our baggage at the concierge desk and had a coffee in the lobby lounge while we waited for our room. We didn’t have to wait very long, and were happy that our room was presented in a fresh clean state in spite of the rush job to get it ready for us.   Our two queen beds were comfortable and plenty of soft pillows supplied. The bathroom was a little bit small, but had a nice large bench top sink area.  The airport shuttle service is excellent, running every 20 mins around the;5
My husband and I again had the pleasure of staying at Four Points by Sheraton at LAX at the end of August and yet again we had a very pleasant and comfortable 24 hours.  This idea of a 24 hour booking is perfect for us as we to and fro from Australia and arrive either early in the morning and leave at night. We found all the staff friendly and efficient from the front desk, concierge, housekeeping and both dining rooms.  Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable with lounge chairs internet and a great view.  All our needs were taken care of - even to giving me clear directions so I could walk to the P.O. and send a package. We will always stay at this hotel on our way through LA especially with Phil as manager - no wonder his staff are happy and attentive.;5
Spent the last night of our vacation here as we had an early morning flight. Excellent night's sleep. Room was very spacious, clean and quiet. Sat by the pool and had a drink to relax after we checked in (drinks were a bit pricey and only so-so). Have stayed at other airport hotels at LAX and would definitely choose to go back to this one. Staff was friendly and service in pub for dinner was very good.;4
The service was Great, the rooms are nice and spacious, and the beds.....SUPER comfortable beds...like sleeping on a cloud! Definitely recommended this airport hotel!  It would however be great if thy had More courtesy shuttles from airport, ESP for night incoming flights.;5
This is the perfect airport hotel.  Excellent and friendly customer service, clean rooms, good amenities, and convenient location.  We stay here every time we have to fly out of LAX.  Just wish there were more courtesy buses, as it is always a wait to get to the hotel.;5
Good location to airport but bad location if you want to see Los Angeles, we rented a car and it took us at least 40 minutes to get anywhere worth seeing like Malibu, Beverly Hills, or the Hollywood sign.  The staff at the hotel was nice and accommodating- our room smelled like cigarette smoke and they moved us to a different room but no offer was made to credit for our inconvenience.  The hotel did have a computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes which was convenient too..;4
Had the pleasure of having a breakfast meeting in your hotel and our hostess Estela Estrada was truly delightful.  Extremely attentive and dedicated to making sure our needs were met.  I would definitely refer your hotel because of employees like her.  Dwight Render Advertising Account Manager  Black Meetings & Tourism;5
We only fly once a year back to Wisconsin to visit our family. The last two years we flew our of Las Vegas as our son was stationed there and they took us to the airport and before that we always flew out of Ontario and we stayed at the Sheraton there and would leave our vehicle at the hotel while we were gone.  This year LA had the best flights for us to take so  we called Sheraton  and they booked us at the Four Points. We had an early flight so our stay was only for one night but an enjoyable one.  Everyone was very helpful and pleasant and we left our car there for the week and everything was great.  We will stay at the Four Points again when we fly from Los Angeles.;5
We travel everywhere, all the time. we stay in plenty of starwood properties, and lots of others, always 4 to 5 stars. In Los Angeles we are usually at the Gateway, not the 4 points, but it was available, and our plans were last minute. Frankly I was not excited to be at my lesser choice. But I was mistaken, and so pleasantly surprised, from the very first moment, through the entire stay! Listen, it was terribly late when we came in, but everyone was on their A game, from the greeting and valet, front desk, pool lady, everybody bustling, cheerful and professional .Here's a tiny, but telling, example. The woman at the coffee shop, 6 a.m. goes searching in the kitchen for me, to find heavy whipping cream! Then insists on keeping some there for the next morning as well! Did not;5
My partner and I needed to stay in LA for one night before our flight home and decided to book in at the Four Points. The main reason for this decision was the 24 hour check in option. Our flight was not until 5.30pm the following day so it was an absolute life saver to be able to take it easy in the hotel and not have to find somewhere to hang for half the afternoon before our flight. We used the gym during our stay and the facilities there were satisfactory. We did not eat at the restaurant (check out the Greek restaurant 'Alikis' around the corner instead!!) but we did get a bagel the following morning for breakfast at the cafe. We didn't use the pool but this area looked fine as well. The bed was really comfy and the room was really big. The bathroom was basic, if not a;3
I had to unexpectedly book room while in LA, and decided to book at Four Points thru Orbitz because it was the most reasonably priced.   Tyron was the Front Desk receptionist who helped to make the very best of the situation for my bday trip.   His courtesy and level of attention was exemplary and very rare to experience in this age of customer service.;4
I am fussy and also own a corporate travel agency. I have stayed at Four Points LAX many times over the years. The staff always make you feel welcome and almost like part of the family.  I could not find fault with this nice hotel.;5
Imagine our delightful surprise when we checked in at Four Points LAX and were greeted by the same wonderful young woman who attended our needs the year before.  JEALESSIA remembered us and showered us with a great, warm and wonderful hello.  Her efficient attentiveness and her infectious smile made all the difference between staying at an austere, cold hotel to a warm, inviting retreat for weary travelers.  JEALESSIA presented us with bags of sinful but delicious chocolate chip cookies during each stay and took care of honoring our overnight parking needs.  She left nothing out.  Her enthusiasm is remarkable.  People such as herself make all the difference in the world.  Our room was clean, well appointed and the complimentary grooming/toiletry items are always a plus.;5
We stayed here when arrived in LA and again also the night prior to leaving LA. The hotel is right at the airport and there is a shuttle. It is close to the major highway, just down the street so directions were not difficult. The hotel was nice, liked the bar and lounge, starbucks, there was a steakhouse type restaurant which was ok, average. The room was spacious and clean and I spent half the night watching the planes land because window faced a runway which I thought was great.;4
We stayed at this hotel upon our arrival from Sydney which arrived at 9:45am.  The reason we chose Four Points was because of the 24 hr check-in feature, which meant we could check in straight away and not wait until 3pm like most other hotels.   Room was clean and spacious. No complaints. Would stay here again in transit.;4
Staying here for 3 nights before heading home....great clean room with great bed and comfy pillows so hard to find!!! Big enough rooms and very very helpful with anything we ask!! Would def stay here again!!! Children loved the pool as stayed open late which is great!!  A few places to eat around here so always handing if dont have car!!! Free shuttle to airport which is handy!!!;5
Staff were very helpful on an overnight before catching an early flight. Shuttle runs frequently. Room was quiet and clean. No restaurants nearby except fast food, so wife and I ate at hotel restaurant which we normally don't do. We were surprised. Both our meals were excellent, prepared as ordered and served in a timely manner.;4
I booked a room at this 4 star hotel for a staff member using Priceline Express deal. I assumed based on the review that this would be a very nice hotel. It is and it isn't. There are three towers with rooms and one of the three was clearly not a 4 star more like a 2 star. My staff member said it appeared that all the Priceline deal purchases were put in this particular tower. Worst of all my staff member actually contracted BED BUGS while staying in the hotel room. It's disgusting that a 4 star hotel would use their 4 star reputation to cover up the fact they are sticking people who find a good deal in room that is clearly not 4 star and less than acceptable.;2
An average three star hotel with clean rooms if a little cramped.  A small pool with sun loungers but perfectly adequate for a short stay.  Hotel shuttle bus service to Manhattan Beach is well worth using at only $5 each for a day pass.  Hotel restaurant serves average food but is expensive - recommend walking out of the hotel and finding other places to eat.  There's a starbuck about a 3 minute walk away.;3
The staff were great, and the frequent shuttle bus was very helpful and ran frequently. Nice and quiet too and close to the airport. Good price for the room. The buffet breakfast was a bit naf! But it was a good price for what you got.;4
I received a warm welcome despite arriving at the hotel after 1am. Check-in took no time at all. The room was spacious and very clean, as were the common areas. The complimentary airport shuttle runs frequently throughout the day and night. I had a great experience overall with this hotel, and would definitely plan to return the next time I'm transiting LAX.;5
When I have an early flight from LAX, I enjoy staying at the Four Points.  I normally rent from Avis, which is across the street.  When I have an early flight and need to return the rental car, I come to the Sheraton and check into the hotel.  A porter takes my luggage to my room while I return the rental car.  When I return the luggage is in my room plus a bucket of ice, if requested.  The pizza is wonderful!  The staff is always friendly.  I have stayed at other hotels in the area, but I really like the service at the Four Points.;5
Spoke with Julian - asst front desk manager to confirm our reservation. He was very pleasant on the phone and provided outstanding customer service - details of which i will relate to Phil Baxter on our arrival later this month. We have stayed many times at this property and have never been disappointed.;5
Stayed at the Four points on 3 occasions in June/July on 2 trips to the USA and on the whole enjoyed my stays.  All 3 rooms were Deluxe, in both the front and rear towers. the one at the back of the building certainly seems to have the quieter lifts.  Overall the stays were enjoyable, the shuttle was prompt on all occasions and the checkin nice and easy.  First morning the room was available early which was fantastic.  On one of the stays, used the 24 hour stay facility which was also very handy for a late night departing flight.  Only complaints in my stay was - the 2nd rooms we had were double deluxes, which had no fridge, and only got one bottle of free water, whereas the King deluxe had a fridge and 2 bottles of water, which I thought was a little unusual.  On the 3rd stay;4
We have had an amazing stay here. It's very good value and the are always professional with a smile. The pool area is kept immaculately clean and is a quite place to relax. First class in every respect;5
Convenient to airport with shuttle service.  We stay here regularly when passing through LAX to cruise terminal or connecting flights and/or visiting relatives.   Clean, quiet hotel with responsive staff.  We will return.;5
"Good hotel but only the renovated rooms, if you end up in one of the inside rooms like I did it was not what you would expect from a roadside truckers motel and when I complained they changed my room to a better and what they called it was a ""renovated room"" mainly business people around and stuff were helpful";3
We always stay at this great hotel by LAX. It's a convenient place to stay overnight before a morning flight, especially during the weekdays since the traffic is horrendous here in Los Angeles. We don't have to worry about getting to the airport in time. We usually do the park 'n stay package so we can leave our car parked at the Four Points.  The rooms are clean and spacious and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Our last visit in August 2013, was the same except the hotel upgraded our room but to a room with one bed for our family of 3. No problem, they immediately corrected it and upgraded us free to a room with 2 beds.   We never have worries staying here. Our expectations are always met and sometimes they go above that.;5
Everything about the hotel was wonderful! The location was excellent, the rooms are spacious and exceptionally clean, the staff was accommodating. Overall this was a wonderful experience! We look forward to staying at the hotel again.;5
Spent just a night at this hotel, and I can say, that overall experience is really good. On check in it was a problem with the booking system, so the manager gave us free drinks tickets to spend the time in the bar. In total it took just 15 minutes to fix the problem. Room was in great condition, clean and comfortable. Also I should mention that at least our area was very quite. The only one disadvantage is that you have to pay for the parking.;5
The hotel was clean, and surprisingly quiet. The parking was $19,.00 a day which was somewhat disappointing, but it is at the airport.  The parking lot has a sketchy feel, and there was broken glass in some areas.  The hotel is somewhat large, and the elevators took a long time (slow).  On the positive side, there was no airport noise!  I would stay again!;3
I looked at several other hotels nearby before coming and chose this one because of the great reviews they had.  I was not disappointed.  The lobby was beautiful, nice staff, nice restaurant (with vegan options even), and close to the airport.  The room was a bit small (normal for the area), but had really nice comfortable bed, nice flat screen TV, and all the things we needed.  Very little if any airplane noises.  The pool was nice (not too cold/warm).  We visited some hotels nearby and felt lucky to be there.  My 2 year old had a great time running around the spacious hall ways and playing in the pool.  The couches in lobby, beds in the room, and the staff were all far superior to the other hotels across the street.  The manager really cares about keeping things going well;5
Recently spent over a week at this location on a business trip and had the pleasure of having to connect some where along the way with all departments and what a job they do. From arrival the door/bell desk staff friendly helpful and energetic. The front desk staff (cant remember all their names) but supervisor Justin and everyone was beyond the call of duty.  Room was awesome and housekeeping so neat and friendly and helpful with anything i needed.Bar food and service was great and listening to the   the bar staff tell the customers about the drinks and food was very interesting and good to see they have that knowledge  Over all a very comfortable and great hotel experience ,,i spend over half my life in hotels with work and its nice to meet a group of people who enjoy what;5
I had to stay here at the tail end of a business trip because I had an early morning flight.  After a really long day, I was greeted by a really nice receptionist, who gave me free cookies as I checked in.  She gave me a bag that had three huge chocolate chip cookies that were nice and soft—I thought three was a bit excessive, but I ate them all anyways.  This four points is pretty large.  It has an expansive lobby that is easy to get lost in, but lots of place to hang out if you wanted a change of scenery from your room.  There is a map in the lobby that tells you where the shuttle is as it is making its rounds to send you back to the airport.  It's free and you don't have to call ahead.  I waited for about 15 minutes at the airport for pick up and 10 minutes after check out to;4
We needed a room near the airport as we had to be at the airport by 5am.  This hotel was perfect.  We dropped off the car at Budget and walked across the street.  We checked in at 11 am as rooms were available.  The room looked brand new. The bathroom was about the size of our dining room at home!  The hotel staff was incredibly helpful.  Jess in Guest Services was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  We checked out and the airport shuttle was right out front and had us at the terminal in five minutes.  (the shuttle leave every 15-20 minutes 24 hours a day). People's reviews commented on the hotel's noise level.  The hotel is situated at the end of the runway.  You hear the planes if you open the window.  Otherwise it is quiet.  I do not know how full the hotel was, but I did;5
Called and spoke with Jess in the Parking Department.  My daughter required parking but was flying out and did not require a room.  The requirement for parking was to book online and have a PRINT OUT hardcopy of the reservation.  My daughter had no access to a printer.  Jess had me send her reservation via email.  He printed it out for her and left it at the Guest Services desk.  Thank you Jess, because of you we will continue to stay at the Sheraton when we are in LA.;5
needed a 1 night , full day stopover. This was great. There is a free and quick shuttle from LAX. Check in was quick and the room fine. We stored our bags there the next day as we had a night flight out of LAX. We caught the ocean bus that goes from near the hotel to Manhattan Beach, very handy. We had drinks in hotel bar, which were reasonable and the buffet breakfast was well priced and had a good selection of hot/cold foods.;4
Didn't sleep well   I did not sleep well at all at this hotel as I was constantly woken up during the night by annoying thumping foot steps from above floor, voices and baby crying from neighboring rooms due to thin wall, saggy bed and bad cigarette smell from the room.  The  bed is located right beside a big thin window along a walkway. And I felt like I was sleeping along the walkway. I can hear every single noise and commotion when someone would to walk pass. This is a very busy hotel with many rooms (I suspect must be the attractive rate or there are better rooms out there in the hotel), and you can imagine the noise.   The floor is so thin, every steps you take would shake the floor. I can see a glass of water rippling even when my grade 5 son took some steps. At one point,;1
On your next early morning flight out of LAX, consider a stay at this hotel the evening before, and avoid the LA traffic jams!  The rooms are spacious and comfortable, [love those Heavenly Beds], and the hotel's public areas very nice.  The lobby, bar, and dining room are comfortable as well as attractive, and the food good.  The hotel is contemporary, and inviting.  The pool is another plus!  The shuttles run 24 hours a day.  The biggest positive is the great Stay and Park option.  We just paid $185 [without taxes], were upgraded to a junior suite, and had up to 14 days of parking included in the cost. It is self-parking, and the lot is uncovered.  A bit of advice, keep a few paper towels and a bottle of glass cleaner in your car, so that you can clean the windows before;4
This Sheraton wins points (no pun intended) for being: Very, very close to the airport Large, clean room Comfortable bed Decent Breakfast options I never heard any disturbing noises despite being so close to the airport.  The down sides were few, and none are critical: Room was large but fairly spartan - little decoration, furniture a bit sparse or undersized. Closet is just an open space with a hanger bar - no doors/curtain, etc The layout shows the hotel's age - bathroom was adequate but could use updating They must be experiencing a soap shortage - because they provided only 1 small bar on arrival, and upon the second day refresh provided a second so I could have one by the sink and one in the shower without transferring bars - no, there was no liquid body soap provided.;3
I always stay here when traveling to L.A.  I first chose it because it is across the street from Budget, so it's convenient to return the car and walk back to the hotel.  I keep coming back because the rates are reasonable, the rooms clean, the staff friendly, and the shuttle to the airport is dependable.  And they had bottled water in the room for free.  It was a simple thing, but something I have not experienced at other hotels.;5
A typical chain hotel, the big upside of this hotel is that they offer a 24 hour room at no additional charge if you book it in advance. This is a huge plus if your return flight leaves in the evening. We enjoyed a beautiful day in Santa Monica before being able to return to the clean, comfortable hotel room to take a shower and preparing us for the upcoming suffering of 11 hours of economy class! A decent restaurant is located inside the hotel, self parking costs 19 Dollars per night.;5
Yes, there where flies and  cockroaches in my room, not one but several. Room service was terrible, a simple cob salad and tomato soup got me sick. The response at the front desk was I will make a report.  Don not stay there.;1
This is a very well ran hotel and has very reasonable rates.  The staff was very accommodating, even though I needed to check in earlier than the 3PM posted time.  The room was very modern, clean, quiet, and had all the expected amenities.  The room service was excellent and the room was cleaned to original condition every day. Wifi worked perfect and was easy to access.   The menu options for the restaurant and room service had very good selections and the room service was fast.  The public spaces were very well kept, the business center area overlooked the pool, which looked to be in top condition. I saw a lot of couples and families enjoying the hotel.  The location was easy to get in and out of, and was close to the rental car return facilities.   I pre-paid my room and;5
In July, my husband and I spent our vacation in Nevis, West Indies in the Caribbean.  Because we live on the west coast, it was a difficult trip to manage - connecting flights and a final destination of Fresno meant that we had to spend our final evening in a Los Angeles hotel.  Our travel agent booked this hotel for us.  We arrived at 11PM and had a flight out the next morning at 10 so this room was just to catch a couple of winks.  It was easy to find a shuttle at the airport to take us to the hotel so that was nice.  Lobby was okay so how bad could the room be?  It was pretty icky.   The enclosed hallway with windows/ rooms had windows to the hallway was a weird set up.. we stayed on the 4th floor.  Tiny room, dingy, not easy to understand TV remote, and a shower that was so;1
i had a stay for 3 nights and it was satisfactory to my family about comfort stay here. Typical Sheraton effect giving excellent ambiance. i liked proximity to airport, breakfast facility, evening snack bar. Restaurant is good and reachable. Parking is costly but there are options near by, Overall fantastic stay.;4
We stayed at Four Points anly because they offer the 24 hour check in deal. As we had a lat flight to Austalia jd flew into LA late the previous night, a hotl for the whole day suited us perfectly. The bed was extremely comfortable and the check in was quick and hassle free. The hotel is close to most car renal companies with budget and Avis just across the road. We made use of the pool in the afternoon and enjoyed being able to relax in the sun.  Overall this place does represent good value.;4
Awesome place, very friendly staff. I was there for a business trip and found it to be a great place to stay. The hotel has great food, friendly staff and + for SPG members. Totally recommend this place.;5
The hotel is very good for an overnight stay.  The staff are fabulous from the Manager Julian Brito, to the desk staff, Edith Alvarez [who has welcomed us often], Lizzette Rodriguez, and our long time wonderful waiter in the restaurant Jesus Guitterez. Great people make for a good experience.;5
Nice hotel, wonderful shuttle service and a really good price for the Room and Long Term Parking.  Room was clean and our bathroom was a pretty good size.  No complaints, except maybe they need a dual paned window to quiet the room a bit from the street noise, but that is just me trying to find something to complain about.  the front desk was so very helpful and nice and had a crib up in the room ASAP. I will be back for sure.  No regrets.;5
Usually when you rent a Sheraton you think you are all set. Well, definately not here..All i can say is it reminded me of a dorm hall for freshman if i ever imagined one. if your sitting on the toilet than you cant open the door period. I was honestly afraid to lay on top of the bed, never mind getting in it. than i ventured to find food..... i was told by the front desk that the restaurant was opened till 11:00, only to arrive at 10:35 and was rudely told the kitchen was closed. I also tried to get ice on the 4th floor, my floor, but the machine was no longer there, empty on the 3rd and 5th floor, and non existent on the 1st. Stay at the marriott courtyard next door for the same price;1
Rooms are outdated, unclean, and smelly. Bathrooms are slippery, and almost fell in shower. Bad experience with room service too. Although management took care of room service bill , I didn't have a proper dinner that evening since it was too late to go out. Did not notice any other restaurants in the area. Only positive is the location of hotel( close to airport and has shuttle service).;2
This hotel has a very comfortable bed.However it did not make up for all the confusions at the front desk. It was simple 2rooms with 2 queens and one room with 1 king. After about 20 confusing minutes we get to our rooms(all on different floors. Which we were told they were by each other) it was 1room 1 queen 2  with a king. So back to the front desk we went. Finally at 11pm we got it worked out..until check out we were charged $19per night for parking which didn't get mentioned at checkin and not charged the rate we were given at reservation time. With that we had a long confusing about. Not to mention all left paying different prices for the same rooms and reservation . There was a $90 difference between the charges.. I would say the beat part of this hotel were the beds and;3
I was pleased with everything but would have appreciated a fridge in the room. I ate at the sports bar at at Comfort. Food was great at both though a little pricey. The service at Comfort with James as our waiter was lacking. He never refilled water and was missing despite the place being almost empty. I loved the bed!!;4
I met Alexis at 12:45am. She was very charming, patient, and attentive. Thank you for being such a gracious young lady. Her interaction with others was very courteous and professional. She was the highlight of Four Points.;5
This was our first stay at a Starwood property for a very long time, and we were impressed. Having secured our rooms at the eleventh hour (everything else was booked solid and even the hotel's website could only offer run-of-house) on priceline.com, we were not expecting the red carpet on arrival. How wrong we were. Reception staff were delightful, warm and welcoming. We were able to be accommodated despite arriving a couple of hours early, and our rooms were right across the corridor from each other. They were clean and fresh, and the only amenity I thought would have been useful was a fridge.  The pool provided an oasis for our families to relax, and the bar staff were as friendly as the other staff we met. Finally, we ate in the sports bar and had the best hotel meal of our;4
"It's a nice airport hotel, close to the airport. You can hear aircraft noise, but it's not too noticeable--it's more like background noise. Rooms come with a free bottle of water and a refrigerator. There didn't seem to be a lot of places to eat within walking distance, but I had a rental car, so that wasn't much of an issue. The parking lot in the back can be a little hard to navigate.   They have a ""Four Points by Sheraton LAX 24-Hour Check-In / Check-Out"" offer, which allows for flexible check-in and check-out times. I saw a lot of airline crews when I was checking in/checking out.  There's a rental car office on site. Depending on where I needed to go in Los Angeles, I would stay here again.";4
Good for an airport location but needs more shuttles at peak times or a ticket system. We went down early when there were only a few other people waiting. By the time the shuttle arrived there was a mob trying to get onto the shuttle. We all could not fit.;3
It's a basic airport hotel. Clean, friendly staff, comfortable beds, nice pool area. The restaurant downstairs is pretty good (a little expensive but it's hard to find something else in the area so it's worth it to eat here). The room seemed a bit small but it was nice having free water and a coffee pot/refrigerator. I could hear planes flying overhead a few times but it didn't bother us at night when we were sleeping. The airport shuttle comes frequently but the Four Points is the last hotel on it's route so it was already pretty full when it came to pick us up. Overall, good hotel if it's cheaper than others in the area. I wasn't overly impressed but I wasn't unimpressed either. Good choice for a night before or after a flight.;3
Nice location, easy shuttle ride (though they need more shuttles - all were crowded). Nice Four points. Good bed and bedding. There is a Burger King across the street and A Subway about a 10 minute walk, so you have a few options if you are on foot. Plus they do have a lounge. Clean. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.;4
Bid on this room on Priceline and I must say for a two star hotel, this was quite a surprise. I feel like this was better then the actual Sheraton near LAX. I think I will start to stay here instead when on business again. My only complaint on this place is the parking lot. way in the back and not accommodating to the travelers to me. Mostly all compact parking spaces and it was super late when I got in felt kind of unsafe if I were alone getting in to my car. Otherwise staff was great, room was nice, and interior was great. Don't let the exterior fool you.;4
We stayed at the Four Points after a late arrival from Tahiti - and before our return flight to Canada the next day.  The hotel is convenient to LAX.  Rooms are basic, but inexpensive and the rate includes free WiFi.  Self parking is an extra $19/day.  When we stayed there they were having a lot of trouble with the gate to the self parking area and they did not appear to have adequate and knowledgeable staff to assist guests in accessing the parking area.  We found a parking spot in the valet parking area so weren't significantly inconvenienced, but many guests experienced delays of 15 or more minutes trying to access the parking area.;3
I stayed at this property a second time as I found its location was very convenient to the airport and to access the LA. This time, the facilities were upgraded with renovation. The staffs at front desks were exceptionally helpful since the check-in process was very quick,and was the check-out one. I learned from this stay that they do provide the laundry machines for guests and this suited me well as the 3 weeks traveling to many cities/states, I could really make use of the service. The room was spacious as usual, the maid did good job in cleaning and making our room no matter how late I left the room to run errands or shopping nearby. The shuttle service which normally comes in every 15-20 minutes make your life going to airport back and forth easier. The rental car companies;5
Whilst the hotel itself is nothing special, the fact that they offer a 24 hour check in/out policy for no extra charge is excellent.  I was able to get off a longhual flight at 7pm, check in at 8, and then check out the next evening at 7 for another overnight flight….brilliant, and something I wish more hotels would offer, and the main reason I chose this hotel.  However, other aspects weren’t great.  The hotel felt generally old, especially down by the pool.  My key cards kept breaking (including 3 times in a 20 minutes period, which made me late as I couldn’t get into my room and had to make repeated visits to the front desk).  Staff were generally nice, and I was able to get a few drinks vouchers from the front desk for being a Gold member.  I used the co-op hotel bus for a;4
The hotel was close to lax and cheap especially with starwood points. The hotel looks new and has a heated pool and fitness room. Down side is that the staff need some work. Managers were great but I missed 2 shuttles because I was told they looked different when I called. I waited in line to ask a quick question with 2 people helping the party ahead of me. I wasn't acknowledged. But the party didn't speak English and they both seemed confused. Overall I see why some people were so harsh but it's LA. It's cheap and easy. It would help if you complain right away to a manager. They will take care of it. The good employees will benefit and thru bad ones will leave or change Not a real issue since everyone has mobile phones but it still bugged me that they charge for local calls. I;5
Stayed at this hotel for four nights at the end of July.  Before getting to the hotel review, some tips on the airport shuttle.  All airport hotels use the same shuttle service - these blue shuttles.  Pay close attention to the hotel names scrolling on the front and side of the bus.  Usually one shuttle serves two (or sometimes one) hotel.  If you're looking for an exclusive Four Points shuttle bus, you will not find it.    Overall, I give the Four Points four stars because the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  The common areas are beautifully appointed (although the main lobby sitting area is freezing cold and it was impossible for me to stay there longer than a few minutes).  The food in the restaurant is quite good (they serve breakfast and dinner only).  Yes, it is;4
"I'm actually still here but wanted to write this review before I forgot everything.   The lobby is newly remodeled and looks great. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The hallways and rooms are older but it looks like they tried to do a quick modernization that wasn't full finished or was done for pennies on the dollar. The room is spacious but when I first checked in I noticed there was a wadded up tissue on the floor. After further inspection I noticed a long hair in the sink (I have short hair) and things weren't ""super clean"". The bed is comfortable and was very clean but the rest of the room was sub par and not someplace I'd ever take my spouse for a vacation/romantic getaway.   Parking for guests is about $20 a day and has in/out privileges. There's a small lot in";3
We went here last week, to stay while we brought my grandson to find an apt in LA, for school.  The bathroom was disgraceful, someone else's hair clogging the tub, lights not working, scum all around the sink..We complained and were given free breakfasts, and promised the room would be better.  The room was never cleaned better, and our keys locked us out 7 times in 4 days, with trips down to front desk to replace them..If you're smart you will stay clear, very clear of this place.  One good thing, the wait staff in the Dining Room, and Pub were excellent.;1
I've stayed at this hotel about 6 times and it is a great airport hotel as it is convenient and offer a great deal of amenities.  If you stay in the old wing the room is old and depressing and has a musky oder but if you stay in the new renovated wing on the preferred floor it is another world;3
We had a late check in around 1am and were directed to the rear parking lot to park, after driving around we discovered there was no parking and we were directed to park in Vallet Parking. We were helped into our room thankfully as we had 2 small children and 8 pieces of luggage. Decent recovery with a nice room however.;2
"1) Room was bigger than I thought for just a single room.  Bathroom was larger than normal. 2) service was great - had an issue and they resolved it right away. 3) check in was great - clerk named Tyron gave my kids some cookies; helped us w/ parking for our guests...got my two sisters rooms on the same floor I was, so we could be close. 4) Food at Brewster was good. 5) location was handy for returning rental cars.. they were less than 5 minutes away.";5
I did not expect this Four Points to have as good of service as it did, assuming a hotel near a hotel would be hectic and busy. However, we were treated with hospitality right from the moment we stepped foot in the hotel lobby. The man in the front desk, Tyron, was especially helpful by explaining things thoroughly and cracking some jokes along the way to keep the mood light and personal. Service in a hotel is greatly undervalued, and I will definitely consider coming back to this hotel the next time I visit Los Angeles!;5
I loved this hotel. Really close to the airport with a clean shuttle. The hotel was very nice with modern rooms. Comfortable beds and soft towels. My one complaint would be there was no pantry in the lobby to buy food and also no snacks machines anywhere on the premises. I checked in very late and had just a few hours to sleep before my flight and had no time to go get food. So bring a bag of chips and its a perfect stay.;5
Got this hotel by chance on Priceline - needed a hotel for 1 night - hotel was a great deal for the price I paid and the staff was very friendly.  Tyron at the front desk chased me down into the parking lot because I left my keys on the counter at the front desk.  The Brewster's restaurant/bar was pretty good for a hotel restaurant, had some beer and a burger, service was also friendly.;5
A few years ago this hotel had a major remodeling that upgraded the room decor and lobby significantly.  The staff are pleasant and accommodating, the rooms are large and airy, the beds are extremely comfortable and the showers are very nice.  What more could you ask for at an airport hotel?    In addition, the restaurant is very good for breakfast and the shuttle van departs frequently for the airport.  All in all a great place to stay at the airport.;4
I usually stay at the Sheraton LAX, but after reading so much good press about the 4 Points ( and getting a good rate), I decided to check it out the other day, and I'm glad I did. Everyone I encountered dispensed efficient and friendly service and the corner room on the 7th floor was a good deal bigger than the one I usually get at the Sheraton( especially useful as I had a lot of repacking to do before heading back the the Mid East) and had a fridge to boot. I didn't have time to eat or use the facilities, but the pool area was nice. This is now my second favorite 4 Points, just after the one in Bangkok.;5
We started our trip by checking in at the front desk, and the pleasure started there. We were helped by, Martha Delcid. She was more than helpful with our accommodations, and when she discovered we were newlyweds, she made our trip even more special, by comping our continental breakfast, which was wonderfully put together, and the staff in the dining room was exceptional, and Jesus helped us by answering questions we had, and made sure we didn't need to lift a finger other than filling our own plates. Martha even accommodated us by giving us an end room, so as we would not be bothered by sound on either side of us, so we would enjoy our honeymoon that much more. So far our stay has been amazing, and we will definitely be planning our next trip to stay at the Sheraton hotel line.;5
There isn't a better hotel beer selection that I have seen. An amazing revolving selection of some of the best beers in the world. And the fish tacos are excellent. Of course, Oswaldo (Ossie), and Hilda, the servers at the bar, are a big reason why this bar succeeds. Highly recommended.;4
I like the fact that the trip from and to the airport is minimal and hassle free. The service at the hotel is superb.  The room is clean and comfortable.  I did not take the advantage of all the amenities available because I was in a business meetings most of the time during my 5 day stay, but the environment is inviting and friendly. Overall facility and service is excellent.;4
I had to stay here last minute and got an amazing deal, so I can't complain... The hotel is alright, but could be better... If I got the same rate again, I'd stay... The staff at the front were very helpful and the shuttle was awesome!;3
Relatively low value/price ratio for this facility near LAX.  Common areas deficient in maintenance.  Rooms okay.  Food vastly overpriced (fish tacos and a beer with tip at $30, breakfast, $20 with tip.);3
My stay at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX was an enjoyable experience.  All my needs were met by cheerful and friendly staff.  The facility had everything needed to accommodate and make my stay pleasant.  Do to my tight time schedule, I did not take advantage of all the amenities available.  I recommend this Four Points Hotel for your LAX travel needs.  Thanks!;5
We stayed at this hotel to drop off our kids for an early flight from LAX.  Area is a bit sketchy as is the clientele . You can watch the airplanes fly in and out from your hotel window. We used rewards points so we can't complain much - you get what yo pay for or something like that. Restaurant was expensive and slow for breakfast - not good when in a hurry.;3
1. Room little smelly. 2. Bed blanket with dirty spots. 3. Airplane noise . 4. Ac unit cover falling apart. 5. Tv stand drawers falling apart. 6. Bathroom tile broken (large). 7. Bathroom sink leaking . 8. No kitchen, 9. no fridge - $10per night charge .10. no microvawe . 11. Internet slow . 12. Self parking $21 per night. 13. $4 per glass of milk charge or $20.00 per galon.  14. dirty carpet . 15. Room looks like a 1930s . Needs major maintenance. Only is good looking lobby front desk. Very unhappy with this hotel. Manager Adam and all stuff are very friendly - handled all problems positively . They do not sell tickets to any activities like legoland , San Diego  zoo , Disney world , tours......;1
Requested high floor room - got room on 2nd floor.  Room was overlooking pool/inside of hotel - too noisy to sleep. Bathroom sink had pubic hair in it when first went to use it - not clean.  Room had unpleasant odor & bathroom smelt overpoweringly of bleach used to wash towels. Bed linen also smelt strongly of bleach. Carpet did not look vacuumed. Accidentally booked rate including breakfast instead of parking - food at breakfast buffet was terrible, coffee served was even worse.  Parking is adequate and always found space available.  Upon checkin was given an in/out pass for use during my entire stay but didn't work on checkout day as the front desk agent had only validated it until the day before - what?? Front desk staff were indifferent & seemed to just go through the;2
My wife, her friend, and I needed to stay overnight in LA before our flight back to Australia. We arrived at 10pm on a Monday night and were flying out at 11pm the following day so decided to utilise the 24 hour check in option. Possibly one of the greatest options offered by a hotel....EVER!!! We arrived after a big day of travelling and a few delays and were checked in by the friendly staff. Unfortunately the room we went to reeked of cigarette smoke even though we booked a non-smoking room. When notified of this reception were more than happy to move us to another room which did not have the same odour. (I hope the people who smoked in that room get charged...inconsiderate so and so's) Our room was very clean and spacious with views overlooking the airport where we could;5
Me and my partner stayed here overnight before going to germany -and we're a little bit disappointed. The room was not clean, we had to move to another room to a lower floor. Staff at front desk did not really care in my opinion.. the new room was clean and comfortable - but thats it. ok for a night, but also a little pricey.;3
"The Four Points by Sheraton was adequate but had some odd features, e.g. window of the room opened into hallway, so there was no privacy in the room unless the curtains were pulled.  The bathroom arrangement might have been fine for one person, but the only mirrors were in the vanity/sink area so two women sharing the room had to take turns using the mirrors. High school reunion was held in the hotel, so the room price was reduced and reasonable.  Otherwise I would not chose to stay in this hotel again. All 'round it was just ""OK.""";3
Stayed here on the way to New Zealand after a 6 hour flight from New York. Fast and easy, picked up the free blue bus marked 'Four Points by Sheraton' under the red 'hotels and shuttles' sign directly outside the doors at LAX. 10 min ride and we were in the hotel and 10 mins later in our room.  The room was spacious, had everything we need and a great free coffee machine to make fresh coffee - bonus. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows, as someone has previous commented, were the best pillows. Have slept on in a hotel in a very long time and we travel.   You can apply on-line for a free 24 hr room pass if they have space and its at least 48 before arriving. They emailed back the next day saying I was not successful as booking through Hotel.com does not apply (reread the;5
"I just had an excellent, relaxing and comfortable 2 nights' stay with my family at this Hotel last week.  Staff was all-smiles and extremely helpful throughout, from Front Door while checking in to Front Desk while checking out.  We had made a reservation prior to arriving, but having the Room keycards in our hands in less than 2 minutes after arrival is simply amazing.  Room service & Housekeeping never took more than 10 minutes after requests were made.  Free bottled water and an eco-friendly mindset gives you a 'warm' feeling in the room. :)  Safes are available at the front desk to store your valuables while you relax in the pool, or shop in the city.  The biggest reason to stay here would be the insulation of the building; even though the hotel is really close to the";5
Close to LAX, shuttle to airport, free wifi and nice staff. We were staying at Palos Verdes and decided to get closer to the airport for a morning flight. Well worth considering for an overnight stay in LA and only a couple of miles from Tinsel Town if you like that kind of stuff;4
"I was staying in this hotel for one night since I had a flight that arrived late.  I used 7,000 starpoints for this place and believe me if I could have gotten them back I would have.  I brought my family on vacation and this was just supposed to be a layover.  We arrived at around Midnight.  The lobby is clean and the front desk clerk was nice.  My review is based on the rooms.  I would NEVER stay at this hotel again.  Rooms:  The hallway was dark and looked like they took a motel and just added a  wall with windows to the outside.  The room was damp and smelled.  The bathroom was small and not in the best condition.  The toilet water jumps out when you flush.  That's disgusting.    I provided feedback on my experience in the hotel's survey and basically was told, ""Sorry, you";1
The front desk was very helpful. The room was big with all the amenities, very comfortable room, the entire staff was very gracious, The food is very good and very extensive breakfast menu, excellent hotel and service;5
"Clean and nice rooms eventhough the hotel have same years ón the back. The pool and fitness areas where fine and there a some good restaurants nearby. A special Thank to the room cleaning people - they did a very good job keeping our room clean which wasn't easy with 4 persons in the same room ;0)";4
My husband and I spent 4 days/3 nights at the hotel before going to San Diego and we totally enjoyed our stay.  The staff were friendly and helpful and greeted us each morning as we were leaving for the day.  The room was spotless and the bed was surprisingly comfortable.  All in all, we would definitely stay there again for an extended period of time.;5
Great experience working with the catering staff at this hotel!  They took the time to make sure every detail was perfect.. especially Eden!  She took care of all our needs, and made sure the reunion was a wonderful night!  The food was great and staff was helpful!  A great team of people at the Four Points Sheraton made this 50th reunion fabulous!  Thanks to all! =);5
The Class of 1963 of George Washington High School, Los Angeles held their 50th high school reunion Saturday, July 13, 2013 at the Sheraton Four Points at LAX.  From the very beginning, working with Catering Manager Eden Semere, was a blessing.  She was extremely professional, courteous, gave us so much of her time at our initial meeting and worked with us so that we could have the best reunion possible.  And it was.  The staff at check-in, bellmen, the staff in the banquet room, engineering, the bartender, everyone we came in contact with were polite, accommodating, professional and caring to every detail to ensure we all had a wonderful time.   The accommodations were outstanding as was the food, both at our reunion and the breakfast buffet. I highly recomend this hotel for;5
The hotel is in LAX area. Room is nice and clean. Pillow is the best. Easy access to find restaurants and shopping. Having little problem with amenities. No toothbrush available when we desperately need it.;4
This is the third time staying here. Handy to airport and free shuttle. Staff are helpful. Only problem was the air conditioner in room was very noisy. They have a guest laundry on site. Best thing is the 24 hour check in. Great idea, wish more hotels had it.;4
After a devastating day of missing our international flight home and a flight from NY we were directed to this airport hotel by our airline Qantas. The young man on the front desk was a delight. We arrived around 2.30am, battle worn from the days events, to be greeted by such a happy and helpful staff member made my day. It only got better during breakfast at the hotel restaurant.  We were fortunate to have the friendly Jesus looking after us, he couldn't do enough to make sure we were enjoying our food and made the best pancakes for our girls :) The staff are a credit to this establishment.  Definately a great airport hotel with a free airport shuttle too. Highly recommended.;5
I checked in around 10 pm on July 2 and there were dirty towels in my room.  I went down to the desk and told them and they acted like they did not believe me. I stepped out to go to the Burger King and when I went back to the room, they removed the towels and put them in front of the door.  Why wouldn't they remove them?  It was very tacky.  I asked the front desk about thisa nd they did not want to be bothered. They promised me 2000 starwood points for the inconvenience and I never received them.  I calle dthe hotel and they toook my email and still hve not heard from them.   It was a very disappointing experience.  It is a nicely designed hotel but it has a long way to go to that guests as being welcomed.;2
I am a starwood member and my wife and I were upgraded upon checkin. I really wish I had written down the staff member at the desk but will just say everytime I checkin I am treaded very professionally by the staff at Four Points LAX.;5
I stayed here recently when I was in the area on business and really enjoyed my visit. I appreciated the close proximity to the airport and the welcoming environment in the lobby. They also have a really cool area next to the lobby that has comfortable chairs and a big screen TV. There were a lot of people hanging out in this area and in the pool outside that were clearly enjoying their stay as well. The dining options were extensive and reasonably priced. I especially enjoyed the breakfast. I wish I had had more time to enjoy the various amenities that they offered but will definitely be staying here the next time I'm in the area.;5
"I had stayed at Four Points in San Antonio (near the river-walk), not too long ago.  I had liked it. So, when I went to LA, I decided to stay at this one so close to the airport.  I found it to be an okay hotel.  As far as my rating goes. One star lost for the only window opening into the hallway and the concierge's option limiting antics.  Another star lost to the not having complimentary coffee and for extra parking charges.  Concierge staff tried to shepherd us to certain conducted tours.  I wanted to do a hop-on; hop-off tour.  They had the brochures hidden inside their room.  Upon insistence, they went and got one for me.  They did not have the Star Line bus tours brochures in the brochure stand in the lobby.   This hotel was a little too commercial for my taste.";3
When I go to Los Angeles, my hotel of choice is Four Points LAX. The beds are so comfortable and the customer service is excellent. I am a Starwood Member and my room was upgrade to a junior suite. Each time I arrive at the hotel, I know I will have the best experience.The price for the room is affordable and I  highly recommend staying here.;5
First off let me start by saying before we came here we went to 3 roach hotels before we found 4 points we arrived Friday morning June 28 2013 the staff was instantly friendly holding our bags until check in we got to our room (649) and it was lovely and very clean the beds were so comfortable we almost spent our whole Friday sleeping the previous people who complained about the noise must've been sleep super early because the bikers left early and did return pretty late but the noise didn't bother us like seriously were right next to an airport and you're complaining about motorcycles we and my 2 cousins were there for the bet awards but we did mingle with the motorcyclists which were very friendly and not intimidating at all the guy who previously stated so must have felt this;5
Martha and Julian provided outstanding customer service during my check-in on Jun 23, 2013.  The hotel offered a better industry rate than Expedia/Priceline and they went above and beyond to help me cancel the online reservation with no penalty.  Thanks for your help and convenient stay before an early departure from LAX back home.;5
Well, it's an airport hotel, so there's only so much that I expect.  But when I arrived at 2am - my AeroMexico flight to Buenos Aires had been cancelled - all I wanted to do was check-in, have a light meal, and charge my electronic devices.  Room service was delivered to my room within 20 minutes, there was fast wifi, enough outlets to charge all my devices, and a shower with hot water and silky smooth towels.  I even managed to get three hours of sleep before taking the shuttle bus back to LAX.  That being said, I wouldn't want to stay here any longer. The room was tiny (to put this in perspective, I had to unpack my suitcase on the bed!) and the staff at the Front Desk were rude and surly, but I understand that few hotels roster their best staff on for the graveyard shift…;4
This place was a dump.  The curtains were dirty with stains and spots.  I found dried blood on the wall near the door.  The young man at the front desk was rude and his body language was totally inappropriate.;1
Rooms were not clean at all and all the doors were not locking properly.  Room are very small, not satisfied with overall experience, other four points Sheraton we visited were excellent compared to this , also food availability for family has a limited choice.  Coffee machine did not work at all.;3
Stayed for one night 29th June before flying home. The hotel regularly host Harley Davison  motor bike events. For 24 hours day and night over a 100 bikes were constantly reving up in the car park which is directly in front of many hotel rooms. They then race round the block and return to continue reving up their machines with LOUD music blasting right through the night. We also found them a very intimidating group round the hotel. My advice to any potential guest is find another hotel. PS The buffet breakfast is as bad as it gets.;1
I picked this hotel because I was in-between 2 flights at LAX airport. Location is really convenient, not far from the airport terminals with the free hotel shuttle, 10mins ride. The room: good size, bed was OK, sound proofing was OK (important considering its location below the path of the aircrafts), bathroom amenities were basic, shower gel and shampoo, that's it, no toothbrush, had a bathtub, no walk-in shower. I was on the SPG floor (7th I think). In-room wifi internet is free and fast. Gym is open 24/7, which is good when jetlagged. Breakfast was medium at most, in particular no vegetables were available, not healthy. I've see other 4 Points, this one was not that recent. Wasn't that cheap at $160/night. Overall OK experience, it serves its purpose as a transit hotel for 1;3
I probably won't stay here again.  The lobby looks great and the staff was very helpful.  The rooms themselves though?  Yuck.  Smelled like a convalescent hospital at times.  A/C never got cold.  The rooms we're 2 stars at best.  The night we were there, the hotel was hosting a convention for motorcyclists.  That's right, loud bikes, being ridden around by loud bikers ALL night long.  The hotel did nothing to curb the noise.  One of the worst nights sleep for my family.  Never again.;3
I am writing this review from my hotel bed. It's 3.20am and in three hours I depart from LAX for a 20 hour journey home. I have had no sleep due to some kind of Harley convention nearby that other guests here are attending. In a nutshell, there has been music and engine revving taking place outside for the last six hours. I appreciate stuff like this happens, but on calling the front desk to move rooms have been informed that this is a regular group who use the hotel and it is now fully booked so they can't help. There is no way any guests staying in any front facing rooms of this hotel will be sleeping tonight.  The complaint therefore is why the hotel can facelessly rent out rooms knowing this would happen and knowing that travelling guests require sleep as part of their;2
The check in staff led by Juan and Adam were exceptional. very accomodating and caring. rooms very clean and modern, upgrading going on and the results show. very comfy beds, great shower heads and plenty of hot water. restaurant a bit pricey but nothing else around in the neighborhood unless you visit another hotel. however, if you have transportation,plenty to choice from in el segundo area. this is the best place to stay at lax airport. will continue to stay there whenever I am coming or going through the area.;5
The staff was amazing!  so helpful and willing to go out of their way to help, I had the best time ever, the room service was excellent, and clean . I had the best time ever.!  I would really recommend it to anyone.;5
Had a recent overnight stay at this property and it was great. As a Starwood Platinum, I was upgraded to a Junior Suite. They even gave out cookies as a welcome gift, which were delicious. I can't say too much since I only stayed overnight but the room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was a little small compared to the room but it was good. Great value if you need to stay close to the airport. Best airport hotel property I've stayed at.;5
Location makes this hotel,- close to airport and bus interchange for getting around LA. Check-in ...our 10.30am 24 hour booking room was not available till 11.30am. Room is quite large but no bar fridge or in room safe. Safe at Reception is tiny and could not take iPads etc. There is an ice maker machine on each floor which we used to keep drinks cold. Breakfast buffet is poor quality but adequate for a quick start. Dinner in the restaurant was reasonably priced for food which was not great- there was a Burger King across road which may have been a better choice. Concierge was very helpful and informative. Recommend hotel for a short stopover in LA.;3
My entire stay at the hotel was surprisingly pleasant and price reasonable.  From the time I walked in/registered to the time I left the staff was accomodating and professional.  My room was nice and clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom was very clean.  I ordered room service and the meal was very tasty and delivered fast. I could go on and on about the experience but one thing happen that especially impressed me.  I decided to take the online survey. I left a comment at the end and stated that outside the enjoyable experience and easy of everything that I left my phone & Ipad chargers in the room. Additionally, I stated I would be incredibly impressed if they were sent back to me in the mail.  To my surprise, I received an email an hour later and the manager said they did have;5
Rooms were clean and comfortable. Public areas were updated and well equipped. Car rental return very close by,  24/7 airport shuttle is great for red-eye travel. Everyone was helpful and friendly, never a customer service problem with Starwood facilities;5
"The big advantage of this hotel is that they offer a 24-hour stay (pre-approved on application). So a person arriving from New York at 7.30pm can stay until 7.30pm the next night, allowing her/him to have a rest and a shower before leaving for the 10.10pm QANTAS flight to Sydney. Otherwise, it’s not much different to other airport hotels; a bit run down, but with good beds, plenty of pillows and some drawer space. Surprisingly quiet in our room on the third floor. Generally clean and pleasant enough.  Not much space for luggage, but we managed not to trip over it. Good long desk, and plenty of surface space in the bathroom. Oh, and a comfy chair! which would certainly call me back. Chips (fries) with the vegieburger were also good.   It’s not easy to get anywhere by public";4
Stay clear of this location.  Make sure you understand there are two Sheraton locations within 1 block near LAX airport.  We arrived at the Sheraton Westgate thinking this was the hotel we booked but we were told we are booked at the Four Points Sheraton.  Stay clear of this Four Points Sheraton LAX near airport it like staying in a Super 8 hotel a real dump.;2
This may have been my third or fourth stay at this hotel this year so I think I can say with confidence that the staff is consistently accommodating and kind in nature. Never once have I had someone not deliver service for me or be impolite. The leadership team has done some smart hiring for this well situation hotel.   I like the location of this hotel since it makes for an easy check-in and check-out and car rental return since I fly in and out of LAX. The other factor that I like this hotel is because it is centrally located for the sales calls I have to make around LA and Orange Counties. I will say that it is a true airport location but I don't hear or feel the buzz from the airport operations, and for that I am grateful.   I do wish the restaurant menu was a little more;4
We stayed for two nights and the first night we were in room 553.  There is a horrible humming noise that never stops, coming from the walls.  It made it difficult to sleep and was a constant annoyance. The front desk was super helpful and moved us to a much better room the next night, 681.  The first room had two double beds and the whole room was cramped and uncomfortable.  The second room had two queens and it was spacious.  The location is very convenient to LAX and they have an efficient shuttle service.  As soon as you get there inventory the towel situation because they are skimpy when it comes to supplies.;3
I stayed for one night before early morning flight out of LAX. Room was clean and quiet. I had requested a room in a quiet location. This is a busy, no frills hotel that fits the bill for a one night stopover.;3
Hello Peter,  I want to thank you for having such a great staff. As a flight attendant with Jetblue I stay at many hotels but this one in particularly is amazing. I had the most wonderful customer service experience with one of your managers: Adam K. I needed assistance and Adam was friendly, helpful, compassionate and professional. I am also SPG member and the Westin and its chain of hotels are my absolute favorite. Thanks to Adam and your friendly staff I will continue to frequent your hotel whether I am working or not. Have a terrific day.;4
Was flying out of LAX in the morning so the family needed a one night stopover near LAX with shuttle service so we chose the Four Points LAX.  We had the same issue coming back so we stayed at the Embassy North on the way back which offered a good comparison.    Shuttle Service:  Both hotels use the same shuttle service (blue bus with the fishes) but the Four Points shuttle was much faster in arriving at LAX to pick us up.  On the return trip, it was a zoo at LAX but three Four Points/Westin shuttle buses came by before the Embassy North shuttle.  Since both hotels are kitty corner from each other, we could have jumped on the Four Points shuttle and walked across to the Embassy in hindsight.  Noise:  Four Points wins hands down as it was much quieter for whatever reason - Our;4
"The hotel was the venue of my seminar -- so I have no choice but to stay in the hotel. Four Points by Sheraton is close to LAX airport but away from most of the restaurants and shopping malls. My stay was under direct billing scheme but the hotel required my credit card as ""security deposit"". I checked-out one day earlier than my scheduled departure date and they informed me than ""I am good"" upon check-out. To my surprised when I received my credit card billings, I have a total of more than USD82 charges from the hotel. I cannot think of any reason for the hotel charge, so I wrote them a letter and requested for investigation and immediate reversal of the charges. I was informed that the charge was for ""parking fee""! I was torn between annoyance and amusement, because how can I";2
I stayed in this hotel as layover for my next day flight. It had free shuttle. Upon checking in, they allowed me to check out by 6pm. Room was ordinary, but had comfortable bed and average size room. Wifi was free and very fast. Amenities was good and room was quiet. Although Four Point Hotel is not top line amongst the Starwood hotels, the service and upkeep of this hotel has improved since I last stayed here. Concierge was friendly and very helpful.;4
I found the hotel via a reference of the L.A. tourism Bureau. The manager instantly connected with me and helped me a lot during the process to make this hotel the home for our event on the weekend. All went according to plan, special wishes were taken care of immediately and adjustment to schedule or all kinds of things handled with professional and personal care. The rooms are typical for an airport hotel but nonetheless comfy and clean. All the personel was friendly and forthcoming, there is nothing that couldn´t be done when asked.;5
I stayed for one nite and my check-in process was fast and efficient. The complimentary 24/7 airport shuttle was also a plus as my next morning flight was at 6 am. Only glitch was that the wifi went down for about 10 mins before coming back on.;3
I recently spent two weeks at the Four Points LAX as part of a team conducting customer service training for another employer.  Not only was our training team housed there but so were the attendees.  I have to say that the Four Points team passed with flying colors. My guest room was comfortable and the ballroom accommodated our group very well.  Above all, the staff was courteous and friendly, from the bellmen and concierge to front desk and housekeeping.  Best of all was the catering team.  The catering managers checked in with us several times a day to make sure we had everything we needed.  The catering staff was friendly, efficient and very caring. This team really made it easier to be away from home.  They were almost like extended family by the end of a two week stay.;4
I've never stayed at a hotel near LAX because of all the great options in town but this choice was quite the surprise!  The room was spacious and smelled clean and the bathroom was absolutely fantastic!  It was super clean with dual flush toilets and all white tile, I loved it!  I was worried about hearing the planes but they didn't bother me at all and didn't start up until passed 6:30am so I had a good night's sleep and was able to return my car to Hertz and make my flight in a calm and unhurried way.  I'll definitely stay here again!;4
"Stayed here to get over jetlag following a long flight from Australia, and to prepare to travel Route 66. I could not have found a more suitable hotel, as this one ticked all the boxes.... Clean, comfortable, friendly, great location etc, etc. Would I stop here again?? ""Absolutely!!""";4
We selected this hotel for convenience as we were passing through LA on our  way home (had been here a weeks or so before and had left some things we needed to pick up on our way home.  Hotel was very well located near Avis where we rented a car so trip on the Avis bus to pick up a vehicle and then  a very short drive to the hotel which was a block away.  Same routine heading back to the airport.  All in all, very convenient and a hotel with lots of parking.;4
The hotel was lovely.Front desk was accommodating with the rate I found online which was very competitive.  The shuttle service was prompt and drivers were friendly. Althought I did not spend a great amount of time at the hotel I did find it convenient and relaxing. I loved the kiosk to print boarding passes...very clever.   My only negative was breakfast .I opted not to get buffet and in turn paid $5 for a glass of orange juice. Honestly felt that cost was a bit inflated. I wished I had waited until reaching airport to eat but other than that my stay was great.;4
Excellent property from the front desk staff to the friendly bar staff.  Rooms are great they are set up for the business traveler, the beds are comfortable (I hardly ever say this in a review). Next time I need a room in LAX - this is it!;5
"Once again this hotel has our vote for best LAX overnight.  We used it as a jumping off point for a long flight to Asia by flying from the midwest to LA the night before our flight to China.  Takes some of the sting out of long flights overseas.  Catching a ride from the airport to this hotel is painless--but note that the shuttle doesn't blatantly say ""Four Points by Sheraton"", instead it reads ""Four Points"" on the smallish light sign to the left of the bus's passenger door.  The rooms are pleasant, the pool area is clean and useful, the breakfast is good, the hotel staff is welcoming, cheerful and willing to help with any situation you might have.  The bar is an excellent place to get a late night meal.  The fitness room has most of what you'd need, could have a little more";5
Good for a layover flight, its not your regular box hotel. Has a gorgeous lobby and the rooms are a bit cookie cut i guess but they are nice. The lobby has a great bar and a starbucks thank goodness!! Nice and friendly staff, valet parking is a pain if you have a car because the parking lot is weird. But overall it is a good place to stay.;4
Was only going to be in town overnight so I used my points to book a room at the Four Points LAX.  I had stayed here previously and liked it, so decided to stay again. Front desk staff is very friendly and the room was comfortable and clean.;4
Check in staff very friendly and helpful.   Door greeters fabulous touch, with prompt service on getting vehicles, taxis and luggage.  The room had been upgraded a couple of years prior and not sure what it looked like before but the bathroom could use help. Walking distance to shopoing and eateries.  Perfect!   Functional business hotel. I would definitely stay again.;4
We stayed at the Four Points LAX as a last minute choice when our flight was cancelled and we were forced to stay an additional 2 days. We were beyond thrilled when even though they were fully booked the night before they allowed us to check-in early as soon as they had a room cleaned and ready. They had a wonderful cozy lobby that we camped out in until then. The pool was great and we had wonderful service in the restaurant from Patty who did everything she could to make sure my 3 and 6 year olds were happy with their meal. We also got great advice on local activities from Esteban. So glad we were able to turn a negative experience into a positive by stumbling on this hotel! Very reasonable rate for all of the amenities the hotel offers as well!;5
"Booked king deluxe on Hotels.com  Starwood Executive Member.  Complete Joke of a hotel.  For someone that travels for a living, this was the worst experience in 25 years.  Lousy room.  Paid $225/night and would have had a better room at a Motel 6.  No cable, ""sorry, we're working on that"".  Twin beds, ""oh, that must have been Expedia's fault.""  Lupe, your Manager said there's not much we can do.  Give me a break.  Save your money and stay at anywhere but here.  I would rather drive to Ontario and stay at a roadside Inn than return to this place.";1
We checked into the LAX Four Points for two nights prior to embarking on a West Coast cruise.  As we never had a stopover before here, we were unfamiliar with Los Angeles.  As a starting point to explore the city, we chose the LAX Four Points partly because of the promotion of pay your year of birth on second and subsequent days as well as its location on the ground transportation system. Indeed, the bus terminal is only 2 blocks from the hotel. We were able to catch local buses to Santa Monica and later to the cruise centre at San Pedro for very cheap fares.  The hotel turned out to be very friendly with good concierge service, and had a superb pub with a vast selection of beers from local microbrewers, national and international brewers. The updated room and facilities were;4
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this property. Being a frequent guest at Four Points properties, I did expect the cleanliness and the service, but this property exceeded my expectations. The staff was extremely courteous and professional. The meals at the hotel restaurant were excellent. And the ""little things"" were very appreciated:. Fridge in the room, free wifi, bottle of mouthwash, hair dryer. Also, there is plenty of parking on the street within walking distance of the property. All of it added up to an excellent experience! We are returning to LAX in July and are sure to return to this property.";5
They did not have the room I wanted so they upgraded my room without me asking. The main problem was the taxi driver who insisted there was a mandatory $19 fee that was never mentioned. This person was not an employee of the hotel BUT a hotel bellhop confirmed this suspicious story!!!  Overall great stop, food great!  The Manager of the restaurant who's from Guatemala was great and hot!!!!;5
I recently completed a 9 night stay at this location. We were assigned a 5th floor room that was clean and well maintained. No functionality issues were experienced with the room and water pressure/hot water was both excellent.  Staff at this property offered excellent service with nice touches that offered consistent guest use name and follow through on all requests. We used the pool and exercise facilities each day and both were acceptable. The daily breakfast buffet was adequate with the house-made hot sauce and hearty oatmeal both being highlights. Each morning we received made-to-order scrambled egg whites at no additional charge.  I'm a SPG Platinum so I generally look for a Sheraton since I'd have Club access and a free daily breakfast.  Room rates at the Sheraton Gateway;5
Did a park, sleep, and fly stay.  This hotel is conveniently located close to LAX.  Loved that we were able to leave our car for the week.  The shuttles run every 15-20 minutes 24/7 so you don't have to wait long for a ride to the airport.  The room was clean, big, and the bed was comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Check-in and out was quick and efficient.;5
We booked to stay here after a long flight In to lax & were flying next day to Hawaii. We found the hotel very clean fresh & the staff were all very helpful. The food at the bar & the draft on tap were all great. After such a good nights sleep in a real comfy bed we booked to stay again 2 weeks later B4 our flight over to Orlando. Very close to airport  & a free bus to take to there. Tip if you need a rental car budget is right next door;4
Stayed here at the end of January while connecting through to Oz from Canada, free pick up at the airport was easy and the buses frequent. On arrival the concierge hung onto the majority of my bags so I didn't have to lug all of them to my room an back, and was able to pick them up when I left to go back to airport, king room was a great size with all the necessary amenities needed and was clean, I wa given a late check out of 2pm which was a big help with my late flight departure, the local area seemed fine too no concerns with going out and exploring (not that there is much in the area) but it meant I wasn't confined to the hotel! Would definitely stay again!;5
We were on standby for a flt back to Hawaii and didnt make the flt had to stay over night could find a hotel so checked hotels.com then called hotel to ask for rates was given an awesome rat for one night (was less than $75)  Everyone else in area was over 120 for the night Burger King across the street;4
Stayed one night while transiting.  The room was okay overall, if on the small side. The bed was quite comfortable, though the pillows tend to sink. The TV was an LCD (though I can't quite recall if the channels were in HD). The WiFi speed and signal in the room was fine. I got 1 free bottled water in the room, which is welcome, though I would have preferred two. :-) Design wise, the room was fairly nondescript. I did, however, find it to be cozy.  The bath was on a scale nearer to that of an upscale motel than a 4-star hotel. Combination shower and tub, which I dislike. Still, the water pressure was fine and made for a more than satisfactory long hot shower after a 12-hour flight.  Breakfast was okay but not mind blowing. That having been said, I particularly liked the sausages;3
Stayed overnight June3 using their 24 hour check in/check out, ie checked in 11:30pm and have 24 hours to check out.  Room was in the east tower and was clean and of a decent size with a very comfortable king size bed with down pillows. View was over their carpark but we weren't there for the view.  Bathroom had the basic toiletries and a good hotel hairdryer. Coffee machine with shocking coffee, which is standard in American hotels, as well as tea. No fresh milk. (I bought a small 200ml pack from the gift shop for $2.93!)   We didn't swim but the outdoor pool was large and had plenty of loungers and chairs. Cannot comment on Brewsters, the bar/lounge, only that they do not serve espresso etc. just filtered coffee. :(  All staff were helpful and very pleasant. Lizette at;4
Convenient.  Efficient.  Clean.  We stayed in the newer tower on the way out and the older tower on the way in.  The older section is more than a bit dated, but still comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was a good value.  The staff was all friendly and helpful.  We will stay here again.;4
I picked this hotel due to rate and proximity to airport and expected very little beyond those two aspects. I was awed by the wonderful staff (Alexis at the front desk in particular), the clean spacious rooms with the heavenly beds and the overall quality of the property.;5
I was very pleasantly surprised during my business stay at Four Points LAX.   I was only in LA for one night, I wish that I could have stayed longer.   The food & drink at the pub were excellent as was the outstanding service.   I enjoying sampling several beers recommended by knowledgeable servers.   The room was quiet & comfortable.   I will definitely stay again.;5
"I wanna take this opportunity to thank absolutely everybody working in this great hotel in Los Angeles; very special thanks to Mr. Musie from customer service office for his always dedicated and well-known support when I stay in this hotel, this hotel is my favorite place, each time I visit  Los Angeles for business or during my leave I spend good time there, all-in-all this is because of the effort which has been made by the management of this hotel";5
This place is ideal if you wanted to be next to the airport - only minutes away.  If you plan on staying here to go to theme parks, I would suggest staying more centralised.  This hotel is constantly busy with people coming and going, conventions, military sign ups - just about everything!  When we arrived we were given a room which the air conditioning was broken and without a bar fridge for our sons medication which we had previously advised of which may have been forgotten when the travel agent booked us in but when I went downstairs and spoke to Martha, she was awesome!  She quickly organised a new room and even made sure (personally) that the air conditioning worked and had a bar fridge before we made the switch which was directly opposite the room we had as she made sure;4
We stayed 2 nights before a cruise.  We give this hotel a 5 star plus rating.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The resturant, Brewster's, has great food and beers from all over.  The concierge people were also excellent.  We wanted to go to the Science Center and they got us a private towncar for the same price as a taxi.  We had a king room with a nice view.  It was good sized, very clean and the bed was really comfortable.  They have a free shuttle service to and from the airport which is a nice perk.  Last time in LA we stayed at the Westin.  While it was okay, the Four Points is definitely the better place to stay.  We highly recommend this hotel.;5
Good hotel at LAX with a stay, park and fly program. Free shuttle was used during the daytime and was on time at LAX for both delivery and pickup. Parking area was uncovered lot at rear of hotel so car was dirty after two week trip. Evening restaurant service was slow and the meal expensive. Had a hard time understanding waiter.;4
Stayed there with other associates. My room was the only one without a refrigerator . Some amenities were missing. Only noticed because the second day she replenished it. No water. Glad I brought my own water.  The others got a free bottle of water each day. When we checked in late we had to wait awhile because of the airline crew that stands around the front desk. The front desk was efficient and the room was clean, and the bed was comfortable.  I must have gotten the smallest room of all of us, my room was also missing furniture, and the bathroom was a lot smaller for the same rate.  We all are Starwood Preferred Members.;3
Thanks to Estela Estrada and her team for providing excellent meeting room breakfast and food service throughout the day.  Everyone was professional and we enjoyed the experience.  We were in a 3 day meeting and the staff made it as comfortable as possible.  Thanks!;4
We checked in to the hotel may 23 for one night. They gave us a room with trash and dirty towels eveywhere.  Called lobby and complaint then gave us another room on the same floor which was worse bottle trash iron towels you name it it was in the room. We checked in about 10 pm so was exhausted not up to leaving somewhere else and had a early plane to catch the next morning. We asked for higher floor they stated they are booked. Called us 15 minutes later and they found something higher floor that is for sure clean. Not sure why they didnt do this the first place. Will definetly not coming back to this place again;1
My stay at Four Points was characterized by timely, efficient service at every point during the week.  The hotel is very close to LAX and on the airport shuttle route.  The rooms were comfortable, quiet, and provided for a great nights rest. I intend to stay at this hotel any time I am in town, usually for business.  I recommend this hotel without hesitation.;5
The hotel is well situated around LAX. While it's under the flight path, the noise is minimal. Check in staff were most helpful and accommodating. The breakfast buffet is basic but enough choice to get you on your way for a full day of business or leisure.  The room was comfortable and water pressure in the shower was spot-on.  Parking is plentiful except for when there's a function on in the conference rooms. Would stay here again.;4
Clean rooms, great staff, lots to do. Staff service is excellent! Everyone is helpful and very warm and caring. It is very obvious that they have been well trained in customer service.There is a shuttle that takes you to Manhattan Beach and to some excellent shopping (a mall) and good restaurants for $5.00 round trip that runs every hour. Will definitely be coming back!! Love it here!!;5
Had a hassle-free stay at this hotel.  Chose it because of it's price and proximity to LAX.  We didn't have to wait long for the airport shuttle, the check-in staff polite and friendly.  The room was clean and tidy. The hotel is in close proximity to some of the rental vehicle depots, which is handy.  The pool looked tempting, but ran out of time to try.;4
We had an overnight layover in LA on the way to Hawaii, and chose this hotel based on its close proximaty to the airport, the free shuttle, a reasonble room rate, and favorable reviews on this site.  While our stay was brief, we were pleased with our choice.  We waited about 10 minutes at the airport for a shuttle, and the shuttle stopped at one other property a couple of blocks from our hotel - all in all, a quick trip.  The hotel staff was friendly and we were quickly in our room.  The room had not been restocked with soap, a minor inconvenience quickly remedied by the front desk.  There was also free wifi, a nice bonus.  Even though we were very close to the airport, we could not hear any noise from incoming/outbound flights.  We had an early flight out, so we did not have a;4
Availed of a deluxe room on two separate nights in May, and was graciously given early check in privileges (which I desperately needed after a 13-hour transpacific flight that landed at 830 am, and even more after a combined 14 hours on a Brazil-Atlanta-LAX connection that same week).  The hotel also gave me a late check-out to match the evening departure time for my homebound flight to Asia.  The room is a plain-vanilla affair, bland but cozy enough.  Though updated and refreshed to a certain extent (modern lighting, a flat screen TV, a relatively big desk), I couldn’t shake off that slight 70s/80s feel.  This is especially true when you enter the plain, almost spartan bathroom with its low ceiling (barely enough for me to avoid banging my head when standing in the tub, and I’m;3
The waiter in your restaurant was very helpful and we gave him and his staff accolades all around.  We were there just for the afternoon and over-night so as to catch our flight out of LAX the next morning.  Every thing went beautifully and we caught our shuttle-bus just in time.  We could not have been more pleased with the service that the front desk and the rest of the  Four Points staff provided us.  My wife and I as usual are very grateful.;5
We have stayed at the Four Points a number of times when visiting LA and have never been disappointed.  It's like staying with an old friend.  Its busy being next to LAX but the staff is very helpful and friendly.  We were able to check in early after landing in LAX.  The rooms are clean and modern.  The price is great and it is close to everything.  The shuttle is fast and the rent a car places are right across the street.;5
Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport is an excellent hotel. We stayed here for a family reunion where we had multiple rooms. All our rooms were quiet, clean and well appointed. The bar, restaurant, and pool areas were outstanding. Most importantly,the staff were very friendly, polite and helpful. Management accomodated us in several ways that made our family get together very memorable and special. The service and facilities were five star quality.;5
We had such a great time at the hotel, beautiful large room, big bath, great location, in the middle of everything, at the reception we received the best welcome ever, the service was second to none.. we loved it..;5
attended 5 day spent the night at the hotel as well. Ms. Estrada provided our workshop with lunch, breakfast coffee and snacks in the afternoon each day. She was thoughtful, professional and consistently available to our trainees. Easily engaged, responsive and always friendly. the front desk was also very helpful, attentive and responsive to my questions. I found the room to be clean, well provided for and the room service was timely (in fact typically faster than I was used to). Prices were fair, save the cost of parking.;5
Arrived, exhausted, in the middle of a grueling 5-day, 8-city trip and was delighted at what I found. I was prepared for an older down-graded SPG property, but was VERY pleasantly surprised at how fresh and lively the place was. Enthusiastic greeting from the front desk. Large, clean 3rd floor room (I arrived a bit early, and the clerk apologized for not being able to get me higher). The bed was fantastic, though the pillows were a tad soft. A few signs of age in the bathroom, but nice amenities and full-pressure shower. Loved that the blackout curtains really did black out the late afternoon sun!  Good selection of craft brews at the pool. Didn't try the restaurant, but it was bustling.  Didn't have any problem with the shuttle - because it wasn't necessary! Was able to;4
Sheraton Four Points at LAX  I stayed at this hotel for one night, May 12, 2013.  I was in town for my sister’s wedding and wanted to be close to the airport for my return flight Monday morning.  FRONT DESK:  When I arrived for check-in, it was late at night.  The reservation was pre-paid so it was an easy check-in process.  The reservation was in my husband’s name.  When we left the front desk, my husband decided to return our car to the Hertz rental place so I could go up to the room and get ready for bed.  However, I forgot the room number.  When I re-approached the front desk to request the room number, the clerk almost wouldn’t give me the information because my name wasn’t on the reservation and my husband didn’t sign me in as a guest.  Finally, after I showed them my ID;4
The rooms on the 5th floor where I stayed are nicely updated and very clean. The outdoor pool was heated and was comfortable even on a cool day. There are towels at the pool and the pool bar has a nice selection of micro brewed beers. The airport noise was muted but you can hear it starting about 6am if you are a light sleeper like me. The shuttle service does a continuous loop so all you do is wait for it. We were there for about 10 minutes but your luck may be different. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. This is a basic hotel but it seems to be run very well.;4
We arrived late Thursday night at Los Angeles Airport and had to wait almost 1.5 hours for the shuttle. Other than that, the rooms were nice and clean--very basic and simple. Easy check-in. Good stay for the price. We'd stay here again if we needed to come back to the area.;4
We spend one night in this hotel to get a good nights sleep before making the long tirp home. The beds were very comfortible and the rooms were big.    Price was right for this hotel.  Room service was handy and the staff was friendly!;4
Had the chance to stay at the LAX 4 points Sheraton . It was right across the street from Budget rent a car which worked out great . Checked in late but the nice front desk lady was awesome gave me a room up high saw the view at night and all the lights . Its like a Westin but you don't have to pay Westin prices . Huge bed and awesome shower very clean. Forgot my toothbrush and bingo 5 minutes later got one from housekeeping. In the the morning had a dip in the pool had towels there easy reach and then went to breakfast ..good food but service great from Luis and Jose...good team ! Couldn't turn around had tae and oJ whenever I needed it .  This is my new home for an airport hotel when I need to be close to the airport great central location and the staff are very nice .For the;5
This hotel is too good to be an airport hotel.  Staff is personable, accomadating and efficient. Bar and restaurant have great stuff.  Rooms are quiet and comfortable.     Lobby is inviting and friendly.  Shuttle service timely and with a sense of humor.;5
Stopped over for two nights as a base to see L.A. and found it to be very nice. After initially getting lost we had to phone the hotel who were able to provide us with directions. The pool area is clean and the rooms were nice enough although ours did have a window looking out into the corridor which I thought was a bit weird. The restaurant has a slightly limited menu but the food is all very nice and you should be able to find something.   But without a doubt, the best feature of this hotel is the bar area. Very clean and tidy, great service, friendly atmosphere and the hot wings challenge is great fun.;4
Coming into LAX on a flight from the East Coast, I'd decided to stay near the airport, even though I'm not crazy about airport hotels.   The shuttle, which serves both the Westin and the Four Points, picks up at all terminals, dropping off Westin guests first. More than 20 guests got off at the Westin, leaving just three of us for the trip to the Four Points, which made me wonder if I'd made the right choice.  The Four Points is undergoing a bit of renovation, at least near the lobby, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the stay: from front-desk courteousness, allowing me to look at the room and fitness center before checking in, to the friendly wait staff at breakfast at the in-house Comfort restaurant, I was very impressed with the Four Points @LAX.;4
"Super service! Compliments to the staff.  Enjoyed the pool, gym, coffee shop and restaurants.  Only problem, the Sheraton shuttle driver was asked if this shuttle is the 4 Points Sheraton service? His answer ""can't U read? Turns out it was for the SherAton Hotel! Closed the doors and drove away. Luckily he doesn't work at the hotel itself. Rude mannered individual!";5
I was totally surprised positively by this hotel! The service is impeccable, the amenities are abundant and the price was surprisingly low for all it offers!! This may become my hotel of choice when staying near LAX airport. Keep up with the great work you are doing!;4
Close to LAX, this airport has good rates, quiet and clean rooms and nice ammenities. A great deal and convenient for travellers flying from or through LAX. Many hotels have stopped the ventillation from the rooms, and that makes for a steamy, humid room after a shower. This hotel maintains the good ventillation and no problem with this. Desk staff is friendly and is responsive to needs. Good job and a nice stay!;5
Convenient to use free shuttle to the airport. Front desk staffs are kind. Lobby is good. But the room is very old, can hear TV sound next door. Need a nenovation for a room.;3
"The front desk employee approached me at her counter without saying one word for the first 6 mins of her arriving after not being present for about 15 minutes. Another guest walked up and she asked her if she could help her (I am black and the guest that approached the counter was white). After assisting the other guest she asked me if she could help me and I went banana's asking if she didn't see me standing at her counter waiting to be assisted. She said, ""oh i'm sorry. I thought you were waiting for someone."" I replied thats why you should greet everyone and ask if they have been assisted. The gentleman who brought up my amenities that I requested had a serious attitude problem. Not staying here ever again!!!";1
We booked two rooms and stayed for one night prior to a cruise with two teenagers and two children. The rooms were very clean and the on site restaurant had choices for kids. The concierge was very helpful in recommending activities to please everyone and the tour trolley bus which takes you to the beach towns and shopping was very close. We didn't get a chance to enjoy to pool but it looked very inviting. Super clean and bright lobby and friendly staff at check in. I would recommend this property for an LAX stop over.;4
Don't look any further for a hotel with great costumer service, clean and comfortable rooms, and good dining and room service.  I stay here when arriving or departing from LAX. They work with my arrival and departure times even when those times are not within the normal hotel checkin and checkout times.  I have never had a less than wonderful experience with this hotel.  The staff is kind and service oriented.  I have tried more expensive hotels in the area and found them lacking compared to this hotel.  Besides everything else, it's an excellent value.;5
You will not go wrong choosing this hotel if you need to be near LAX for a flight, a conference or business. The well-appointed rooms, the food quality of the restaurant is way above the category of hotel you expect, but the best is the high level of service you get from all the employees;5
"Got a great deal of help from Esteban, at the info centre; he answered to all our questions and helped us finding a good city tour and a good deal on the car rental. Overall the hotel was good, people are very nice.";4
Stayed here for a week while I attended a conference.  Clean Room, friendly staff, internet included in cost of room.  Free shuttle to and from the airport.  Good Food in the restaurant.  Caught trolley to Manhattan Beach very close to the hotel.  A bottle of water for each of us each day is a bonus.;5
Stayed here again in January 2013 and my experience was just as great as the last. As a young female traveling alone I felt very safe in this hotel. The staff are always professional and friendly in every department. I also had a great time at the bar chatting to the bartenders on both nights that I was there.   The beds are extremely comfortable and the WIFI is excellent. Everything is on point. Will definitely be staying here from now on when I'm stopping in LA between my flights. Phil the GM goes out of his way to follow up and thank you for reviews and making sure you had a good stay and that is another reason I will return, what a wonderful service.;5
"Arrived at this hotel at 11pm on Friday evening. To self park my car I had to drive around the side of the hotel and elk back from their in a very poorly lit area with no sidewalks. Scary! I even asked if the security guard could come out as it felt unsafe and was told that there are security cameras and that should suffice! I will not stay here again because of this...well the uncomfortable beds are also a deciding factor! Other than that, the hotel is like any other ""motel 8"" type of place!";4
We stayed here for three nights while visiting LA.  The hotel has an interesting policy of not letting guests use luggage carts without assistance.  The parking lot is behind the hotel and it is quite a walk to the front of the hotel.;3
Stayed here once on vacation  close to the airport  parking is a lot but that's normal for the area  the outdoor pool is nice.  the rooms are average.  comfortable beds and the bathrooms could use some updating.  overall it was a good stay.;3
This Hotel is old and tired but clean.  It's the staff who make a difference-they are great. We stayed here prior to joining a tour and found the food Brewsters quite good too.  A long walk to anything else, shopping or food, so good for stopover but not long term-my opinion.;4
Third time here - each time for just one night.  We have a timeshare in Palm Springs, arrive late at night and stay here and depart the next morning.  Obviously, not as picky as if we were going on a decent length vacation.  We've stayed at (and reviewed) some truly luxury hotels but neither need nor want that for one night at the airport!  Shuttle easy and quick - go to where the car rental shuttle buses are and you will see a hotel one for this Four Points and the Westin.  Warm welcome and upgraded to a Junior Suite - apparently thanks to our Platinum status with Starwood.  Room very comfortable, breakfast fine and getting ready to head out.  More to the point, at only 4,000 points per night, it's just perfect.  This place is perfect for us and we'll keep coming back.;4
Our stay (5 nights) at the Four Points Sheraton LAX was less than desirable (traveling with toddler and elderly mother in law).  But I will provide details so that one can make an informed decision. Pros: near the airport, has a restaurant and meeting rooms onsite, a guest microwave on the property, free wi-fi in rooms, housekeeping was pleasant, clean and comfortable bed, birth rate promotion, mgmt gave a discounted parking rate, the same of which I saw advertised prior to arriving :-/. Cons: I was located on the second floor of the west tower,  where management said he put me in an upgraded room. The rooms were standard with spots on the walls and large, visible hand smudges on the door. My in-room phone was completely dead. When initially making my reservation over the phone,;2
We were here for a night April 29th and I PM'd Phil to let him know that I was coming as a lowly SPG Gold, who booked the night on points.  I was upgraded to a Junior suite, and was able to check in early around noon. The shuttle to the airport is very convenient, runs 24/7 and shares with the Westin. The $5 round trip shuttle to Manhattan beach is just minutes away from the hotel. The room was also very quiet.  Compared to other hotels around LAX that I've stayed in(Westin, Hilton etc.), this hotel exceeds expectations in both cleanliness and service(usually the two main problems in LAX hotels). I did not expect a four points to be so clean, especially the bathroom! You could eat off the floor. All staff were very friendly as well, everyone saying hello!   Thanks for the;5
We travelled to the Four Points by Sheraton by the Fly Away Shuttle bus which goes from the main railway station to the airport. At the airport, we got the hotel shuttle bus. We chose the Four Points because it was near the airport and it was good value. While we were there we still managed to travel all over Los Angeles by buses which only charged us 50 cents each per trip! We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant and had 2 surprisingly good evening meals at the nearby Burger King! Our room had a window and door which opened on to a corridor. The corridor also had a window directly opposite ours. The room was clean and QUIET and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. We returned to the airport by the hotel shuttle bus.;4
I scheduled a meeting at the 4PS for about 60 people.  The meeting was two days long and included, rooming, meeting space, and breakfast and lunch buffets.  I can't praise the staff enough for pulling this meeting off without a hitch!  I can't recall any meeting that I was responsible for having absolutely no issues.  The Sales Department, Fred and Kathy, really surpassed all of my expectations.  This may not be a location that jumps out for a meeting but I found to be a perfect meeting space.;5
Very convenient to the airport and Loyola Marymount University, Marina Del Rey, and Manhattan Beach, this hotel has all of the conveniences at economical prices.  On a recent repeat visit, we ran into a bathroom clog.  A quick call to the operator and maintenance was there in 5 minutes, worked on it for 15 minutes, cleaned up afterwards, and was very polite in the process.  It could not have been handled more professionally.  We stopped into the restaurant for breakfast on our 2 day stay and the service was very friendly as well.  These people like their jobs!  The parking can be a bit crowded but that is the only critique I could have about this property.;4
We stayed at the Four Points Sheraton the night before our flight home-it was right near the airport, and right near the rental car company we used.  The hotel is immaculate, the room was spacious (there were 4 of us), and the beds were incredibly comfortable.  We didn't have dinner there, but ordered appetizers and drinks at the bar downstairs-service was very good.  Although we did not use the outdoor pool, it looked very clean.  We will definitely stay at a Four Points Hotel again.;5
I was put up in this hotel compliments of my airline because of a missed connection. I was in the East Tower. The room looked no better than a 2* hotel. But the really nasty parts were: 1) the sticky carpet, 2) the candy wrappers under the bed covers, 3) the dirty crumpled up tissues under the night side, and 4) the wet used hand towel in the shower. I'm sure if I looked more I would find more....nasty. I definitely wouldn't pay for this place.;2
This was my 3rd stay here, and will continue to use this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Many great services, free internet, heated pool. and even bottles of water each day! Enjoyed a few meals at the restaurant as well.;5
We had a 12 hour layover before our flight to Oz and got a great day rate.  Shuttle was quick and convenient, and the little driver hauled our luggage like a pro wrestler!  Front desk was wonderfully welcoming.  Bell captain gave great directions to a little grocery store.  Pool was lovely, clean and WARM!  OMG--the beds!  While we didn't feel like sleeping in the middle of the day, it was easy to snuggle in and just snooze!  Very quiet and comfortable.  I only wish they had a Jacuzzi or whirlpool.  It was a wonderful experience all around!;5
Purposely booked this hotel for a 8 day vacation due to their location to the sites we were interested in seeing. From the moment we got there, the greeting staff were so genuine and helpful. Musi helped for us to arrange a couple of tours we didn't know were available, and they turned out to be wonderful. The front desk made some adjustments to make us more comfortable for our long stay that went above and beyond at no extra charge. Beds were so comfortable we didn't want to leave. This was a very clean, comfortable, accommodating hotel with a group of people working there, that know exactly how to please their customers, and all for the most reasonable rates I could find. Thank you Four Points staff for a memorable first stay in California!;5
This is a nice hotel, and a great place for a conference.  I have attended quite a few conferences in quite a few hotels over the years. This one was notable, because there were no hiccups at all. The staff was extremely helpful, and everything worked.  Food was very good.  Key insight was provided by one of the very good managers, who said that he has learned that if you hire nice people, it usually works out great.;5
For those who drive, this Four Points by Sheraton hotel can be less of a bargain. But if you're simply staying near LAX, this hotel is a good choice, albeit a little on the worn side. Surprisingly quiet considering it's near the main landing strip, assuming you face the front, not the side toward the landing strip.;3
Unexpected delay at LAX caused my wife and I to stay overnight in Los Angeles near the airport. Reservation service on phone was very helpful and understanding. Front desk was friendly and upgraded our room by asking about my AAA membership. Room & bathroom were super clean. Room service was very prompt and courteous. Beds & pillows were cloud soft! From Lobby to Room, everything appeared very professionally maintained. Overall, one the most delightful stays we have had in recent memory. Kudos to the management and staff at Four Points Sheraton at LAX!;5
I am surprised by the reviews here and think the three stars I gave it is generous. This is a very old hotel with a not very well done renovation. The blankets and comforters were old. The bathroom was clean but old. And the walls were thin-- I could hear every step the person above me took and the doors all the way down the hall closing. You could probably find something better for the relatively high price they charge. I would not recommend this hotel.;3
"Overall the hotel is well run except their policy of cleaning rooms until 1 am. After requesting a very quiet room in advance and being reassured of quiet upon checking in,  I was awoken by a maid yelling ""Housekeeping"" outside my door at about 11pm, who then proceeded to clean rooms around me.  I dialed front desk manager who apologized and yet admitted he would be doing nothing to stop the noise other than speaking with the manager of housekeeping.  The cleaner continued for some time.  If you want to have a relaxing sleep odds are you might just be woken up by the sound of a vacuum cleaner and banging/clanging around in the rooms surrounding yours.  Beware!";2
I have had the opportunity to travel to many countries and I have stayed in all kinds of hotels but this one in particular was excellent all the staff was awesome and always willing to give the extra mile for their guests. They made my first trip to LA awesome and just because of that I'm planning to go back very soon they tours available for guest with discounts, company's to rent a car right in front of their premises the food at the little bar is awesome and the prices very reasonable and I strongly recommend to become SPG member to get even more from your trips. Thank you guys for your help and for make my trip even better!!!!;5
This is a nice fairly good price hotel for the LAX airport. The decor was newly decorated and beds were very comfy. Safe and they offer a shuttle service to the LAX airport. Very nice has a nice restaurant and very helpful staff. Easy to find and could not hear the planes.;4
Very Convenient location. Front desk was very friendly and helpful. Nice room. Good value. Pub has good food. Staff very friendly. Pool area is nice and there is a decent workout room. Main dining room breakfast was 5 on a scale of 1-10. Best rooms are in the towers. This hotel generally has the best prices in the LAX airport area.;4
The Four Points by Sheraton LAX is in the best location to experience a fabulous vacation in LA. There is no doubt it is centrally located to all areas of LA since it is accessible to many highways and back streets to maximize travel time during traffic. We were able to enjoy marina del rey, malibu, santa barbara, disney, Chapman university, huntington beach, hollywood, pasadena, etc. Not to mention that it is close to the In and Out for the best burgers and fries. We were able to drop off our rental car (next door) a day earlier since there are direct shuttles to the airport that run very frequently at all times of the day and night.  I was able to take advantage of the fitness center every morning with great machines and weights area. We saved a bundle of money getting some;5
A standard looking airport hotel, made special by the staff. Often arriving on a late flight from Hawaii, we stay here.  it isconvenient to the rental car lots and minutes from LAX.  The staff has always been exceptional, especially the front desk and the bar/restaurant, Brewsters, where all of them are great, especially Oswaldo,A bartender, who was dealing with some rude demanding guests with incredible patience.  Housekeeping is efficient and pleasant, especially Aurora who was eager to see that we were comfortable.  So much better than the average airport hotel. e have also stayed at several of the other hotels in the area but this is our favorite.;5
The Four Points by Sheraton at LAX provides an excellent service.  First, they offer 24 hour check-in which enables you to check in to a room at any hour of day and keep it for up to 24 hours.  Coming off or getting on flights at strange hours is therefore not a problem.  Second, the staff are courteous and helpful.  Third, the rooms are spacious, light, airy and well appointed.  Fourth, the beds are very comfortable and a sound sleep is possible.  Fifth, the shuttle to the airport runs every 20 minutes or so.  The restaurant is the weak link as far as I was concerned.  The menu was limited, the service was ordinary and the prices were on the high side.  The only easy option is a Burger King across the road, but you could ride the hotel shuttle back to the airport to eat.;5
I had to get a hotel room near LAX airport because I didn't make my flight to Honolulu, Hawaii. I am a platinum SPG member so of course I picked a SPG property. I normally like staying at the Sheratons because they have a club lounge but since this Four Points Sheraton had gave me a good rate I decided to stay there. I had no luggage because they were checked in all the way and was sent to Hawaii. To top it all off,  I had been in the Atlanta airport (my flight origin) all day and I was very tired and anxious. When I first got to the property I assume the bellman desk was the front desk and I was a little confused. Someone walked me to the aprropriate desk and I was able to meet a wonderful front desk lady name Martha. She checked me in and went above and beyond the call of duty;5
"We stayed here for 2 nights in April. The hotel is large and the lobby area is nice. We paid an exorbitant amount for parking. We got ""upgraded"" to   a deluxe room, but the room itself looked like it needed some touch ups.  The phones weren't programmed correctly so trying to reach room service or the front desk was not possible. On one our elevator trips, some metal portion of door frame fell over and could have easily hit the person alighting, but fortunately he side stepped it.The hotel also seemed understaffed, we couldn't get any dishes and were told to go to the lobby personally to collect it. Also to avail of a microwave, we had to go to what seemed like the employee break room. Quite awkward.Our room didn't get cleaned, the same lady who was doing the housekeeping in the";3
Excellent hotel clean, comfortable , good location and very nice staff ,very reasonable price .Four points  have all what i need as a hotel in my  trip to la, plus the restaurant is very good.   I will stay at this hotel on my next trip to lax;5
I drove to this hotel to get a good nights sleep prior to my 6am flight out of LAX. I should have just driven from Ventura. Hotel lobby, very nice. Hotel restaurant, very good food and service. No complaints. Now the room... My room was located on a top floor but it was more like a motel 6. Hallways were open air but closed off with glass. Your room window faces the walkway for all travelers heading to their rooms. Sleep is impossible as you can hear every door slam on entire floor. I could hear my neighbors talking as well as when they used the restroom. I called to complain but the noises never stopped. If I wanted zero sleep prior to a 12 hour travel day, this would be your hotel. If you looking to actually sleep more than 1 hour, stay somewhere else. Awful experience.;1
Very friendly staff, nice rooms, very comfortable beds and free wifi. Great value. Shuttle bus is frequent but makes a stop at the westin hotel first. Check in is very quick. Only parkingfee is much too expensiv for hotelguests!  Looking forward to come back to the four points by sheraton hotel.;4
A typical airport hotel. Better than many but a little tired. However, VERY convenient for the airport and layovers before getting your next flight. Free airport shuttle that is efficient and regular. Staff behind the desk very helpful and polite. Nice restaurant but not many options if you want a light snack. The ubiquitous Starbucks in the lobby. Breakfast expensive for what you get. All round though a comfortable and clean hotel. You would probably not want to vacation there. Trip advisor needs to have the option GOOD as this hotel was above average but does not warrant VERY GOOD. This hotel was a GOOD option for a layover at LAX and I would stay there again. Reasonably priced at $109. Internet price.;3
We used this hotel as an overnight layover. The hotel itself  and the room are very clean, beds are comfortable. Great value. Check in service is quick and friendly. It worked out great for us as a convenient layover spot. The only thing is that I wished their courtesy shuttles were more frequent and marked more clearly as we accidentally took the regular Sheraton shuttle.;4
The staff here are extremely nice and the wi-fi was great, but the room was very tiny and the air was not working. It was 80 degrees all night. The parking was terrible too, there was a wedding the night i was there, and they definitely do not have the space for that.;2
Very average hotel .some rooms are old fashioned motel like with bedroom windows opening towards an open corridor where people will walk past at all times day and night .Rooms average with warn out mattresses . Has old feel about it.in summary average hotel convenient to airport but better available for similar price in the area;3
we where there twice in two wek different time  we ate in the bar the first time  we asked if there was a fast food near by and was told the only place to eat that was close was inside the hotel   i asked for  my meat to be done but not  burt  i got it reare and burnt  this was in the bar the  next time we at at comfort  same   meanu  it only offer  very little  and the  price was un real high  the secon time we at at comfort in the front of the hotel i order the hamber again   makeing sure he understood that i wanted my hambuger done in the middle   and not burnt  in any way    and  my friend order meat loaf they brought her  three rools which was full of mildew we show it to the waiter  he did not seem to care  when my hambuger came  it was red in the middle and realy, burnt;4
this is the second four points hotel weve stayed at in the last 3 or 4 months.  the branding done by the hotels is very refreshing.  check in was the quickest we had in a month long business trip. ok its not a 4 or 5 star. .but value wise...this property worked for us. it was an older property and some things just cant be swapped out.  like an old fashion heating/a/c unit ...but the rest of the hotel checked out just fine;4
The staff and check in service was wonderful, especially Jasmine at LAX 4 Points Sheraton.  She was courteous and very helpful.  I will recommend the hotel to my friends.  The rooms were great, clean, and staff from entry to leaving was so helpful.  I enjoyed my stay and love their service.  The staff was so friendly and kind and there is no words to say how wonderful they are. Please make sure they;5
Stayed at the property while visiting Universal Studios.  Couldn't book in Universal City as the last minute rates were through the roof!  About a 40 minute drive to the Studios.  Clean hotel.  Booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds each.  Nice friendly staff.  Hotel offers free shuttle every 15 minutes to the airport.  In room coffee, iron & board, blower, toiletries, pool.  No inroom safe but available at front desk.  Complimentary wifi.  Self parking at $19 per night.  Two restaurants on the property and room service offered.  Plenty of restaurants to choose from that surround the hotel.    Would recommend and stay here again.  (Sorry couldn't post pics of this property);4
I don't know what they feed the staff at Four Points LAX, they're always happy. I just stayed there this past Wednesday (4/10), had a small fender bender in LA traffic, and was a bit bummed. Arrived to the hotel with greeted smiles from the hotel staff. The front desk invited me to their free beer tasting by the pool. Met some interesting people and relaxed a bit. Again, as usual, the room was the perfect temp, super clean and all in order. I travel to LA once a month for business, staying 1-2 nights. This is where I stay every time. I get what everyone wants and expects, friendly staff with smiles, a clean hotel, rooms and extras like beer tasting. I don't have to think about where I stay when traveling to LA, I focus on business.;5
We got in very early in the morning from Australia to L.A. and were extremely tired.  I had requested an early check but did not think I would get it.  The staff at the front desk could not have been friendlier and were happy to give us our 2 rooms very early as requested.  We got to the room and freshened up a bit and went to lunch downstairs.  It was delicious, inexpensive and we had a great waiter, Marco.  Our entire stay here was wonderful between Martin at the front desk and Jazmin, and on to the service in the restaurant with Marco.  I would highly recommend this hotel to others as a nice stop between flights.  You will be treated well and sleep soundly in their nice accommodations.;5
I stayed at Four Points as I had an early flight to catch at LAX the next morning. It is the perfect location with shuttle service every 15 minutes. What I like about this hotel most of all is that the staff are warm and friend and always willing to go the extra mile.  Fitness centers are very important for me whenever I stay at hotels. This hotel has a great fitness center with a lovely heated lap pool. The beds are comfortable. What more could you ask for? It's literally like home away from home for me.  Keep the good works up Four Points LA team!;5
Stayed here last month 1 night due to late arrival at LAX.  Few points -  - Easy connection from airport by free hotel shuttle some 20minutes.  - Room was ok clean & tidy, all the usual items you need.  - Make sure to get an advance booking for good deal and guaranteed room.  - Place is within short walking distance for most of major car rentals at LAX. Myself I walked to HERTZ following morning some 10 minutes.  - Car parking in the hotel also available - first 30minutes are free (in case you need to pick up / drop luggage etc)  - Overall very friendly service - would stay here again.;3
I stayed at Four Points for one night since I had an early flight to catch at LAX the next day. It's about a quarter mile from the airport and a free shuttle comes by every 15-20 minutes to take you to (and from) the airport. It's also located across the street from Budget Rental, so it's convenient if you're looking to rent a car too.  The hotel did not meet my expectations at all. As my friend said, it looked like a motel converted to a hotel. The rooms have windows that face the hallway, so you basically have no natural light in the room unless you want everyone walking through the hallway to see inside your room. The furnishings are also quite old. No refrigerator, no extra blanket, no shower gel (only one bar of soap to use for both the sink and shower, which is separated;2
We waited 40 minutes for a bus from LAX and then waited quite a while to check in . The restaurant is very average and the service,well like a truck stop. If you can afford the difference stay at the Sheraton Gateway,so much better for an extra 30 dollars.;3
First, I was surprised at how quiet this hotel was, for being so close (convenient!) to LAX.  I only remember hearing planes twice, and the sound goes away immediately.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable -- we slept really well.  Even though we checked in very late at night we were placed on the SPG floor, with rooms right near each other.    After checking in we were hungry, and found that the bar would be open 'till 1:00 a.m., and was still serving food.  Hooray!  We had great, friendly service there, and the fries and onion rings we ordered were delicious.  The staff was very friendly and seemed to care that we had a pleasant stay.  You really notice what a difference that can make after you've stayed at a hotel (Jamaica Bay Inn) where the staff was more interested in;5
Stayed here in April 2013 with my wife and two teenage kids the night before an early flight at LAX. The hotel is located very close to LAX and some car rental lots, and offers a 24/7 free shuttle to LAX. Parking is $19 a night. We got a good, nonrefundable, internet rate of $85 ($98 with tax), so we didn’t pay for parking, returned the rental the night before, walked two blocks back to the hotel, and took the shuttle at 6am the next morning. Worked great. The hotel offers free internet, but apart from that and the convenient location there's not much else going for it. The rooms and hallways are aging and need an update. The bathroom is very spartan and small. The bed was OK, despite being touted as some kind of special bed, a “Sheraton Four Comfort Bed”. It is not like the;2
the hotel is located in a good place . The rooms are avarage around 3star but def not 4 free coffee is good in room. the only downpour with this place is the breakfast and thts def 2star type all bunged in the buffet contains no real variety or taste the coffee servered is cold and bad , not worth the price of $17 per person if you like you breakfast then avoid this resturant as the slim  afro lady is soooo soo stuck up acts as if its free and we work for her . Apart from that the rest of the hotel is nice, burger king across the road . Busy area as car hire are across the street and all the hotels are next to each other and they have a shuttle from the aiport but it takes a while as it stops alot they have vip tour service bus come to them as well. Expensive tour - cabs are;4
I am an Gold member with SPG and though I support the brand this hotel will not be on my list of places to stay at near LAX. The staff is very nice and my comment is not a reflection of their quality of service and attention to the client. There is one thing I will recommend if you ever stay here: dont order room service. I had lunch here in between meetings and my Asian chicken salad was mainly soggy lettuce, sugary dressing and practically no chicken. Avoid, avoid!;3
The visit was pleasant, nice and simple.  The staff, at check-in, needs to explain parking procedures.  We were not informed that parking fees applied to guest.  No big deal, as we paid, but for future consideration, this needs to happen.;4
We stayed there for 1 night after arriving from the UK. As the name Sheraton was used to describe this hotel we foolishly thought it would be of a reasonable standard, how wrong can you be? The insulation under the hand basin was falling of and was filthy dirty, can you believe there was no toilet roll holder and there was no evidence of there ever having been. We showed the deputy manager the photos we had taken. avoid this hotel if you have any standards.;1
Great hotel. Excellent location. Very close to airport. Ideal for staying when catching a late flight. Lobby is very nice looking. Didnt stay there long enough to check out hotel restuarants but food ordered for dinner (room service) was lovely.   Only downside was that the bath in the bathroom was in need of a renovation.   Definatley reccommend this hotel tho.;4
"We stayed here due to a flight cancellation and were fortunate to be given a special rate coupon by our airline. When we called the hotel, the reservations agent quoted us a higher rate; however, the front desk person quickly acknowledged the ""distressed flyer"" coupon. We were impressed with the attention at the front desk, in spite of the long lines of people checking in. Our upper floor room was clean, comfortable and even had a view of downtown LA and the hills.  This seems to be a hotel for business, airport travelers, and groups. Lobby, bar, and pool were attractive and busy. We ate in the hotel restaurant which was ok, not great. Shuttle service was convenient.";3
Found this place thru Hotwire, and it's the best place for the price to date. Great, free airport pickup, and available late checkout ($40 fee) was a bonus. Room was quiet and comfortable and pool deck was a great place to relax. Staff were professional and shuttle drivers were outstanding.;4
I had a layover at LAX and selected this property based on price and the Sheraton name.   I would stay there again if I just needed a place to rest my head for one night and it was the lowest price.  It would not be my choice for an extended stay.  First, I will say that the staff was friendly on check in.   I did not try any of the restaurants, so I cannot comment on those.   The hotel does need a renovation.   The rooms are small, and the bathroom is particularly tiny.  Though the tile does not appear to be old, the style is very outdated.   It is as if they renovated 10 years ago, and went for a vintage look at the time.  My really big gripe with the hotel is the lack of snack vending machines.  I was up at 3:00 a.m. for an early flight, and I was craving a candy bar.   I;3
Accommodations were impressive, especially given it was an airport hotel.  Really appreciated the extremely helpful staff - especially Cameron!  The lobby area was nice, the room was very clean and though a little small, the bathroom was equally well appointed.  The location is great, making for easy transport to airport and close to freeways, etc.  Much nicer than expected given a airport hotel.;5
Not a great experience in this hotel. You could hear the neighbors and their baby so clearly, it was almost like they were in the same room. The planes were very loud too. You would think, at an airport hotel, that they would get windows that would block the noise. We found the room dated, not very clean with incredibly dirty windows.  On a positive note, the restaurant food was reasonably priced with good food and the shuttle to LAX was very efficient.;2
This particular hotel property, in my opinion, is not up to Sheraton's quality standards.   Mildew on shower head, stained white bath towel and washcloth, bed sheets still damp from laundry, etc.   Room needs updating.  On the positive side, the bartender was friendly and very attentive.  The food was very good.  The selection of draft beer was excellent.   The front desk clerk was very professional and friendly.;2
My oldest son and I were traveling with my husband, 2 other sons & our dog to my hubby's next duty station when we were seperated. Let's just say that American Airlines doesn't know how to treat military personel or their families...  After getting booked on the next flight to Honalulu on Delta, my son & I started looking around for somewhere to stay. I was given a 'Distressed Passenger' card by the Delta agent & called your hotel. the gentleman was kind & said no problem they had rooms available at 11am. I asked if we could come sit & wait (it was around 9am) I really didn't want to hang out at the airport any longer. The gentleman who answered said that will be fine & told me to take the shuttle over.   Upon arrival, the employees were kind-we were not at our best as all our;5
"I know it's difficult to find a decent hotel near LAX and I tried to choose wisely, reading the reviews on Trip Advisor.  We just stayed in the Four Points LAX, and was really disappointed.  Not sure what this hotel used to be, but they needed to do more extensive remodeling to make this a nice place.  When we checked in I asked the woman at the front desk if she could recommend a place to eat nearby that was kid friendly.  She said ""I can't, I don't live around here and am not familiar with this area."" - SERIOUSLY?  She told me to talk to Guest Services.  They weren't particularly helpful either.  After hearing that a 4 mile cab ride would cost us $35 one way, we decided to stay in and eat at Brewsters.  The food was average but the waitress was fantastic.  Can't remember her";2
We were stranded in LA after Delta caused us to miss out flight.  Everyone here was very friendly from check-in to the resturant.  We were able to get a discounted rate and they helped get us the toiletries that were in our luggage that made it to our destination.  Great place to stay!;5
Its one of the best hotels next to the airport, You have suites facing the runway and the SPG club lounge is great during evenings. The staff are pretty friendly and have an amazing breakfast buffet... Not much flight noises to disturb you... Great place to lodge...;5
We'll answer that question in just a wee bit.  First, we attended a Convention this last weekend (March 22-24 2013).  Even though we live in Pasadena, we decided to make a weekend out of it and spend Friday & Saturday night at the hotel. Not too bad of a drive, we left at 5:00pm and we're inside the hotel lobby at 7:00pm.       Before getting to the lobby we parked our car and waited for a valet. No one came, so we unloaded our 2 pieces of luggage, garment bag, and guitar in case.  Just as my husband was about to self park ($12, with Convention discount. Otherwise $19), a nice young man came out to load up our luggage.  Nice guy...but it would have been nicer to have been greeted by him first thing.     When you walk in the lobby what you assume is the front desk (to your right);3
"We stayed for 5 days/4 nights. When we arrived we requested a refrigerator for medication. Took 3 hours to get it to the room. Once it finally got there, management comped us for the delay. 2nd night was Friday and there was a party in the ballroom two floors below us. We could hear the entire thing until after midnight. Several complaints to security (thinking it was a party on our floor). Come to find out there is little noise cancelling between the floors. Was offered to be moved to another room (at midnight?). Declined; party was over in 20 minutes. Management comped our parking ($144 savings) 3rd day (Sat) we asked the front desk if there was another party scheduled so we could move rooms in daylight. Was told no. Turns out there WAS a party scheduled. Same routine as";3
very nice experience.  the room was wonderful, the staff friendly and I loved the restaurant/bar that was open late.  The price is very very reasonable.  I will definitely recommend this hotel and be back.  The pool area is very clean and relaxing.;5
Due to flight delays we didn't arrive at the hotel until 4:00am. The reception staff were wide awake and accommodating - we were not wide awake.   Recognizing the lateness of our arrival time they offered to extend our checkout time by two hours.  The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. My only complaint would be that we didn't get enough time to enjoy it.  Check out was professional and easy. Staff were very helpful recognizing we were from out of the country assistance was offered.   Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the LA Airport area.;5
We stayed in this hotel due to its close proximity from LAX. And we weren't disappointed. At US$107 / night for a room with 2 beds, free wifi, and 24/7 free shuttle service to LAX, one can't complain anymore.;4
"First of all let me say this is a great location next to lax!  Also the bar (Brewsters) is wonderful!!!!  Great food items and brew!  However the room was COLD!   I called at around 7pm to tell them my room was cold.  It was showing 64 degrees after I had thermostat up to 74 for two hours.  The lady on the phone told me to turn off the thermostat, as they do not have heat even available until 10:30pm!   Are you kidding me???  So I did and it got up to 67.  Then at ten I was exhausted from the day and wanted to go to sleep so I turned unit on and up to 74, expecting heat to be on soon.  However I woke up at 2 am freezing.  It was 64 again.  I just turned it off again.  In the morning at check out I told my story to front desk and got an ""Oh, sorry.""  That wasit.  No charge";4
Due to delayed flights and then missing my connecting flight I found myself stuck in LA for 24 hours.  It was after midnight and I was so tired and had no idea where to stay.  I happened to call the 4 Points and they were so kind and helpful!  I got on the courtesy shuttle and the front desk was so kind.  They found me a room, helped me up to the room with my luggage made sure I was all set and all the time with smiles all around!  I found the room comfortable, clean and quiet.  Ate in the restaurant the next day and the food was great as well. I travel to the US from Australia every year and from now on I will stay at the 4 Points every year!  I very much recommend this hotel and mostly because of the terrific staff!!  Thanks for all the help and kindness!!;5
This Four Points is a particularly good one, with fine, well-equipped rooms, very comfortable beds, and convenient shuttle bus service between LAX and the hotel.  The front desk staff are uniformly very pleasant and helpful.;5
I stayed at a Residence Inn all week and moved here on my last night to be close to the airport for an early morning flight.  I was nervous considering the great stay I had a Marriott and have never stayed at a Four Points before.  I am a Platinum Starwood Member as well as a Platinum Marriott members.    Upon check in, I felt like the property was a older hotel that did some sprucing up, but the front desk staff really made the stay enjoyable.  Martin the front desk clerk had exceptional attention to detail and made sure that I was comfortable during my stay and even recommended me to a tour that I could sign up for.  I got a good nights sleep considering it's location and amount of airline traffic in the area.  I found the bed to be average and the linens were ok.  TV was good;3
Stayed at the 4 Points LAX during my time in Los Angeles before heading out to Hawaii and had an amazing stay.  From the minute my girlfriend and I walked in we were greater by nothing but smiles and pleasantries from the staff.  Adam at the front desk was particularly great getting us checked in and set up with an awesome room. Checking out the bar Best brews is also a must with the great selection of beers and nice variety of menu items. Also, Musie ( I hope I spelled his name right) was super helpful in getting us a shuttle down to Manhattan Beach along with our numerous other questions about the area. Overall, great property that we will without a doubt return to and recommend to anyone staying in the area!;5
When I review properties, I always review them on a relative basis given the price paid and the general level of the property. So, while the St. Regis DC is a nicer property, I found the whole experience underwhelming considering my expectations and the price point.  I had the opposite experience at the Four Points LAX. For a great price point, I received a quick friendly check-in and a clean and quiet room. What else would you want from an airport hotel.  Added bonuses include a very engagement Hotel Manager who is very visible with guests and really tries hard. I also had a surprisingly good breakfast. I wasn't expecting much but my omelette was really quite good.  Overall, a great stay and would recommend the property to friends and would return.;5
Decent hotel (definitely refurbished) but if you're expecting awesome, reliable customer service, this is probably not your kind of hotel.  Wake-up call was late, restaurant was nothing special and bellmen were unreliable in the clutch.  Priced well enough but the long-term parking lot isn't secure or covered so I probably would choose differently had I been able to scout it out.;2
"Nice features including spacious room, excellent desk/work area, and refrigerator and coffee maker are partially offset on the downside by a crummy TV channel selection.  Why don't the Sheratons -- and why don't the Marriotts -- have full cable channel service like you can find any day of the week at a Comfort Suites?   And why don't they have more than one or two luggage carts?  Good grief -- this is a business grade/commercial site and many of not most of us are accustomed to getting out own stuff to our own rooms; we even prefer it.  Oh, well, if you want to be a very short walk from Hertz (0.4 mile), Avis (0.2 mile) or Budget (across the street); and if you want a BK within eyeshot and a Carl's Jr. about 0.5 mile away; and if you want free van service to the airport, then";4
Was visiting an Uncle that was having treatment in Cedar Sinai and was trying to find a hotel that didn't cost a fortune and looked like a dump.  With a lot of research I came across the Four Points Sheraton.  To my surprise it was a great experience all the way around.  When checking in the clerks were pleasant and professional.  When getting to our rooms they were clean, roomy and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The complimentary water and coffee was nice.  The second night we dined in the restaurant and the food was terrific.   I would definately stay there again.;5
I love staying at this hotel. They cheerfully accommodate my needs. The rooms have always been comfortable and clean. The noise level is unbelievably low. I stay here even when it is out of my way for where I have meetings in Los Angeles. The staff has also been very helpful without an attitude problem whatsoever. The breakfast buffet is good too with the exception of the pancakes! :);5
This is an overall good hotel for the price, i would not recommend the food but the service is decent. they do have a few employees that dont care and they ignore the line for gold and Platinum members if you are checking in. The price, rooms and location make up for some of the staff. Valet attendents are rude if you are not parking the car in valet where they cant make money they ignore you.;4
We've stayed at Four Points Sheraton LAX at least half a dozen times now on our way to a vacation. We drive up to LA the night before an early morning flight, park our car and enjoy easing into our vacation. The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable and we later go downstairs to the brew bar for an enjoyable dinner and drinks.   Next morning we leave our car parked at the hotel till we return, and take the hotel shuttle to the airport.  On our return a week later we walk out of the airport and onto the hotel shuttle again for the trip back to the hotel to retrieve our car.  Much easier than rushing to the airport for an early morning flight and then having to park your car at one of the airport parking lots!    The perfect way to begin a vacation!;5
I had a business travel for 3 weeks in LAX, which means I need to have a hotel as a home. And I chose the four points. It's a very great expierence to stay there. the room is big, and have a comfort working table. They provide a small size refigerator in the room, which i can keep some breakfast fresh or have some cold beverage. Staffs of the hotel are very kind, they try thier best to help every guest. I forget a package at the stockroom of them, when I try to find it, the staffs give me a lot helps. I'll stay there when I visit  LAX next time.;5
Overall very good value for the price.  Friendlier and lower key than the Westin, Sheraton and Hilton.   Easy walk to a Subway and several other good restaurants.  Room service was fine except the soup was not worth the amount they charged!  They have upgraded the gym a lot since I was last here and it has a separate cardio area, much more spacious and has free weights and benches.   A great improvement!;4
My company has put a cap on hotel rates, so I was forced to try the 4 points vs. the Sheraton LAX or Westin LAX in order to comply.  I think my rate was $125? I've stayed at both the Sheraton and Westin LAX for a $135 or $140 rate before...and trust me, you want to spend the extra $10 or $15 to move away from this 4Points.  I can't say exactly what was off, but it really felt like a huge step below the other Starwood properties.  The room was clean, but old, bed was okay, but the sheets were rough.  I realize that 4 points are a bargain brand, but the rate wasn't THAT much below the others, but the facility is... I will say the front desk staff were outstanding. Again, I can't say I wouldn't recommend this hotel, but for the few extra bucks I'd prefer a bit more upscale hotel.;3
Efficient check in, room ok, some bathroom maitenance required. Parking lot was full, difficult to park later in the evening. Overall, good value and decent property. SPG room not a great room, no water and toilet seat needed repairs. Can hear planes if staying on West side of building.;4
"Being a Starwood member, I thought I'd pick up some quick and easy points for a one night trip to SF, with a package offering free parking.  The hotel is dated, the rooms were tired, and I found it barely average.  Definitely below some of the other Sheraton's I've stayed in.  But a future deal breaker for me, and possibly you if this matters, is that the parking lot is a strange affair, way out back, with most spots far far away from the hotel.  This is a scary place to be late at night for parking, or for your late night return.  Yes, there were big flood lights out there, but I thought that was because they were trying to scare away the many predators who would find a lonely traveler out there a good mark.  The ""free"" shuttle doesn't run very often either.";3
Flew into LAX for a family vacation and wanted to stay at a hotel near the airport since we were arriving late. There are so many hotels in the area that I would not be compelled to come back in the future. We didn have towels, guest services was not accommodating, the room had an odd smell, and the parking lot was VERY difficult to navigate and find a space. Long story short, not worth the price.;3
"We overnighted at the hotel on our way to Maui.  We arrived early at the hotel and the front desk was very helpful, especially Jealessia.  They had a ""no problem"" attitude.  Would definately stay here again.";5
Bottom Line:  I would stay at the Four Points LAX.  I feel like I got a good value for the room rate I received, was pleased with the room, and was well taken care of by staff.  Stayed here for an overnight between flights into/out of LAX.  Check-in was smooth, common areas nice, clean, and up-to-date.  The room was quite spacious and had a nice view of the planes coming into land at LAX.  The A/C in the room may have been on a governor or something because the room never did cool down and was pretty muggy.  Luckily the window would open, which was handy.  Dinner in the hotel restaurant was pretty good, and I was really impressed with the number of beer choices they had and with the quality and variety of the choices themselves.  The server was helpful and offered tastes when I;4
2 nights at 4 points LAX and it was just great!! Desk staff was right on the ball and very helpful, especially Martin. He went out of his way to assure that I was looked after by getting me lined up with a ticket for the Ocean Express Bus. Looked up the metrolink rapid trasit that I would need to get to a suburb and back. Most helpful. The room was nicely appointed and very clean and bed very comfortable. Bathroom was a little small but I was the only one staying. there so it wasn't a problem. Breakfast was buffet, complimentary and tasty. Lax has a unique shuttle program that works very well. The hotels are coordinated into an encompassing system that handles all the hotels. Very convenient. Belonging to Starwood Preferred benefits the traveller so much that I don't understand;5
This is a lay over hotel and do not expect much more than that. The hotel itself is a little dated. My room was okay, the bed was comfortable and the staff were friendly. The restaurant was not very good and there is nothing much outside the hotels except more hotels and some airlines cargo facilities. I would suggest eating in LAX before checking in.  The part that I had a little problem with was the check out process. On Saturday morning at 9am, there were only two hotel staff manning the front desk. It took me more than 10 minutes to check out. Luckily I gave myself plenty of time to catch my flight.   The airport shuttle is also something to be aware of. It runs on a 15 to 20 minutes schedule and not on a fixed departure schedule so you cannot really time it. When I was;3
My family (Mom, Dad, Kids 10 & 8) stayed here last week on our trip to HNL, as we had an overnight layover in LAX.  The shuttle service from the airport and back was very convenient, running every 15 minutes.  Check in was fast and the desk staff very friendly.  They have an outdoor pool that looked nice, but we did not use.    They had apparently been giving out cookies to kids at the front desk, as when we checked in I saw a young boy come up and ask if they had any more.  The desk clerk was very friendly, and pulled one from behind the counter for him.  Very friendly, helpful vibe at this hotel.  Because we signed up as Starwood members, we received 2 free water bottles in our room, even though this was our first stay.  A small touch, but nice.  The room felt spacious and;5
From the moment I checked in, through the time I left the shuttle at the airport to depart...Allstaff members were friendly and helpful.  Want to feel totally welcome and valued, this is the place to stay.  The staff in all areas of the property are equally wonderful.  The propery itself is well locate, but the hotel feels so relaxed compared to the hustle/bustle of LAX area.;5
"I stayed at Four Points because I needed a hotel convenient to LAX. Not only was the hotel conveniently located, they provided a free shuttle. I got an additional treat when I founded out that my rental car company was located in the Hotel! The service I received was exemplary; my every request was met by an enthusiastic staff member. My room was more than comfortable with all the necessary amenities. I recommend this hotel needing a hotel in the LAX area. I also suggest becoming SPG rewards member and taking advantage of the best rate guarantee.";4
We had a very good experience at Four Points LAX and want to thank management for the great idea of a 24 hour rate.  We booked for a check in at 8 a.m. (after arriving from Australia) and a check out at 7 a.m. the following morning.  There was no problem with this arrangement which I think is perfect for a airport hotel.  I had requested a room near the elevator as my husband is handicapped.  We were allocated this but the room was not to our liking (it did not have a view and as my husband had to stay in the room all day this was necessary). We were moved, with no hassle or delay,  to a room with a view but further from the dining room.  However the staff were very accommodating and we know now to book near the lift in the wing where the dining room is located.  The dining room;5
The staff members at Four Points are incredible. The Brewsters bartenders went out of their way to provide great service and drink education, the front desk gave us an extra complimentary breakfast and comped one of our parking tickets, and the restaurant staff was on top of it every step of the way.  I will definitely stay at Four Points again and would recommend them to anyone looking to stay in the Los Angeles area.;5
I got a really good BRG (Best Rate Guarantee) rate here that was just too good to pass up. Fast forward a few weeks, and here I was, checking in to the Four Points LAX for the first time. I stayed here for three nights - March 5 - 8 - and, overall, aside from a few minor quibbles, it was truly a wonderful stay.  1. HOSPITALITY - THEY'VE GOT IT IN SPADES.  The staff at the 4PLAX deserves a gold medal or something for getting it right and even going above and beyond my wildest expectations. For instance:  - I was in town for an audition and needed to be at the venue soon after I landed. A quick tweet later, and I was set up for an early check-in so I wouldn't have to haul my bags halfway across town and back. - Upon arrival, I was checked in by the wonderful Jazmin (apologies if;4
We (family of four) checked into this hotel twice (once flying in and once flying out). This is a good airport hotel:  1. Fast professional check-in. 2. Airport shuttle is awesome and very frequent. Saved us a day on the rental car. 3. Comfortable beds, clean bright bathroom, hot shower. 4. Nice view if you are in the East tower.  Breakfast at Brewster's was expensive ($50 for two adults and two kids!) and I must say that the buffet was pretty ordinary and not fresh. Service was courteous but seemed a bit overwhelmed - a pancake took 20 minutes to show up.  The shuttle service is awesome but you may sometimes find yourself trying to get into a crowded bus because this is the last stop before the airport. That said, once you're in, the airport is next! Reverse the situation when;4
When I was in there last 1 March, I have had a severe low back pain.  It mades me little upsets without reason, and I felt very uncomfortable.  However he was very kind and showed  his all efforts to me, I couldn't remember his name and face. During two days when I stayed, I was very happy and comportable in spite of I have had a severe low back pain. I really appriciate that their mind and services to customer and I will be stay in there on my next  trip. Thank you;5
This is my favorite place to stay near the airport. The staff at the front desk are friendly and accommodating, the rooms are clean and recently refurbished, the wifi is free and fast, and Brewster's is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat and sample some local brews. The room rates are usually lower than the surrounding hotels and as a SPG member, I often find a welcome back tray of grapes, cheese, and cookies in my room. I highly recommend staying here for business or a quick stay between flights at LAX.;5
We looked this hotel for day only before catching a late night flight back home after cruise. The room is large, quiet and comfortable for a good rest. Have coffee machine and free WIFI. The coffee machine and TV remote is not working initially but the cleaning lady next door is quick to replace these for us. Don't expect any view as our window is open to a corridor. Very close to the bus stop route to Santa Monica where we headed out for 2-3 hours. But watch that the express Big Blue Bus (deep blue color) will not stop at the stop on airport blvd. A burger king very close by, also has free WIFI. No other place to wonder around because this is the airport area. OK for a good rest. Shuffle service to airport is good.;4
Coming in from a long flight from Shanghai via Beijing, all I wanted was to get into a hot bath. But learned that the heat in room was controlled elsewhere and would not go on until 9pm. At ten, I called again and was told staff too busy to turn on and to wait 20 more minutes. For the money, hotel is old, white curtains gray, sheets chintzy, wall paper outdated.;1
Stayed 2/27/13 one night.  Great service good customer service not many places you receive it at anymore. Recommend this location close to the  airport. Have stayed here many times over the past few years service coming from Hawaii and going home to Chicago. Rates are very good being close to Airport.      G Lindstrom;5
Just had a large event - 400+ college students and faculty at this hotel.  A hard group to please and even harder to get complimentary remarks concerning their experience.  We heard how great the rooms, food and staff were from attendees.  As planners, we can not agree more.  From check in to check out.;5
I needed a hotel close to LAX as I only had 14 hours between flights. I had made my reservation 3 days prior to my stay and was given a fair rate.   I had a warm, welcoming experience with this hotel from the time I made my reservation to the time I checked out. The reservation agent was warm and friendly, the girl that checked me in made me feel like a valued customer. The free newspaper in the lobby was a nice bonus. I had a nice comfy bed for my short night where I had a good nights sleep before my flight the following morning.  There is also a coffee maker in the room with good coffee and real half n half. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again.no;5
The lobby is nice, the elevators are a bit small for travels with luggage.  The room itself was not super clean or spacious - deluxe is a bit of an exaggeration.  The front desk staff was not friendly.  The bar food was good and the bar stuff was friendly.  The concierge and bell staff was very helpful and friendly.  We only spent one night, we won't be back.;3
I enjoyed my stay after arriving at 11pm, I was so tired, the staff checked me in right away. I was also hungry after the time change room service was on the ball and accomadated all my meal requests!!;5
My experience with this location was good. I can't complain but was expecting a better room. In terms of the bathroom had no vent. The only good thing was the people at Front Desk (very nice, polite, and in good spirits) especially Martha who had checked me in on Friday evening. The elevators were slow. The food at the bar was great and all but one bartender was not a people person on Friday night.;3
After a long flight from Sydney I wanted somewhere to lay my head and rest for the night before the rigours of the next part of the trip. I usually stay at another airport hotel, but this proved marginally cheaper.  It is clean, fresh and with free internet. I was upgraded to a deluxe king room which was more than adequate. It was also excellent value.  A number of the car rental depots are within walking distance of the hotel. I therefore saved a night's parking and picked up my car in the morning.;4
"I) PREAMBLE  Originally, I wanted to go to the Best Western Suites on Century Boulevard because they are currently offering a free night for three stays.  I took this promotion last summer in Europe and got a certificate for a free night, which I used at the BW ""Grand Hôtel de l'Univers"" (reviewed here) during my last trip to Paris in December 2012.   But that LAX BW Suites has a very dishonest cancellation policy and they want you to cancel your reservation one day prior to the arrival date or you lose your money.  Dishonest, indeed, because every time that one of my flights has been cancelled (which happens more and more often nowadays!) it has never been cancelled the day before, but always at the very last minute!  During ""Nemo"" storm in February 2013, more than 4,500";4
What I liked: Convenient location to LAX, with a few fast-food dining options nearby. Shuttle service operated at a good frequency.  Room service and restaurant menu (dinner) was relatively affordable and had many of those comfort food items such as meatloaf!  Great, modern lobby area. Complimentary WI-FI throughout the hotel.  Very good value. Very comfortable bed (which is true of most Starwood properties)  What it could work on: The rooms themselves are very average and slightly dated.  It is a little bit on the small side and the layout of the room provided was awkward, especially the bathroom which was definitely on the small side and looked like it needed an upgrade.  Also, I had a room facing the main street so the room was a bit noisy (but it was quiet enough between;3
Was @ the four points in both january & february, was amazed by hte professionalism by the staff. the room attendant maria asked me if everything with the room was fine---and she was 100% sincere. the front desk manager adam is the epitomy of class. would highly recomend this hotel to any and everyone.;5
The staff is great, they are very helpful and polite. We booked in advance and only paid 92 dollars per night on a Friday and Saturday night for a big clean room with two queen beds and a nice big bathroom. We needed a wheelchair one night and had no problem getting one. They delivered a fridge to our room when requested no problem. When we asked for luggage help durring checkout we got a cart very fast and we had help all the way out to our car. The only issue we had was the ice bucket leaked a little, not bad. Overall I am very pleased with this wonderful hotel and I will be going back.;5
We stay here for one night before we left for the airport the next morning. Overall front desk customer services was great! The price and the room was real good. The beds were real comfortable considering that we traveled a long way that day. The shower was real nice after a long drive.;4
I had a ten hour layover at LAX and this hotel offers very convenient day rates with 24/7 free shuttle service to LAX. The restaurant has a very nice selection of beers and very good pub food. The bartender provides outstanding service. This was my second stay at this location and I will continue to come back.;5
As usual, another great stay at this property.  From the Preferred Guest benefits, to the friendly staff, it is always a pleasure to return to this hotel.  I have read some not-so-good reviews about this property, but can only imagine that they are from folks who either don't travel much, or stay in not-so-good properties.  I have never had a noisy room or bad service at this hotel.  It is an older property, and therefore may not have a five-story high lobby, but it doesn't feel enclosing in any way.  It's lobby and restaurant are light and airy.  I for one will continue to recommend this hotel to any travelers through LAX.  And by the way, I've seen shaky guests at the Ritz!;5
"The ""traditional"" rooms are bad smelling, the ""deluxe"" rooms are not much of an improvement... And their ""preferred guest"" rooms barely resemble what a ""normal"" 3 star hotel room should look like.      Extremely disappointed.";1
A nice hotel.. Quite a nice room, nice pool.. but.. expensive (not free which was a shame) , small parking... long waiting for reception desk.. and as our breakfast was not included in room price, we paid for one.. which was a mistake..  Expensive and not a nice breakfast.. we had much nicer breakfast (for free) and Best Western and other, smaller hotels so were quite disappointed.. Very close to the airport and to Manhattan Beach which we loved.. but would not stay again.. not worth your money sadly...;3
Room was par but customer service was below par. Wait staff in resturaunt in the morning was extremely lousy. Once coffee was delivered, never to be seen of again. Did not stay entire reservation originally planned.;2
We gave this place a shot but were not neccessarily pleased especially based on all the good reviews..........not sure what they are reviewing ? The place is definately old and you can feel that as soon as you walk in........low ceilings and you just get that feel - can't explain it. The service agent did an excellent job checking everyone in by himself - very efficient. We got to our room and again - maybe they have tried to spruce it up but still that feel ??? Bathroom is tiny with the old vents showing and pipes underneath the sink etc., Again nothing dirty or really bad but just did not have the comforting feel. Soundproofing was really bad and it sounds like there is alot of joining rooms with doors...........well we got one of those and I can't stand those - we could;2
Rooms are very good well equiped and clean, very nice bed and breakfast is good, you can feel the sheraton touch in this hotel, service is as usual standard, a bit dificult to find if you are driving there is shuttle bus to LAX,;4
This was our second visit to the Hotel. We have business in the LA area and look to stay in Hotels in surrounding areas. Our first visit was great. However this last visit was less than that. The staff was simply too busy.  When I got to our room I noticed that the light in the front hallway in front of the bathroom was out. I called the front desk and asked if they could replace the bulb. They said they would send someone right over. An hour passed and I got tired of waiting so my infant and I decided to get a bite to eat downstairs as I was hungry. On our way to the restaurant I stopped in the front check in area and let them know we had a light out and no one has come to fix it. The gentleman asked if it was okay to go right away while we were away. I said yes. When returning;2
Last minute booking due to change in flights. Staff was attentive, fast, and friendly, free airport shuttle a big plus! Numerous car rentals within walking distance. Parking is $19 a day but there is street parking for free if you can find an empty spot and also a 2 hr spot right up front by meter if you are just renting for the day. Loved our mini fridge and free wifi! Right off of one of LAX runways but you really can't hear the planes at all and was fun to watch the planes coming in and taking off. Allowed a late checkout till 2pm which was perfect for us since we could not check into our next hotel until 3pm. Spent the rest of our trip at the downtown Sheraton which was sorely disappointing and wished we had stayed at this hotel for the entire stay. Only thing that would;4
I booked a day rate room because I had several hours between flights. I was able to nap and relax before heading back to the airport. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. I never even knew you could book a hotel room during the day!;5
Four Points by Sheraton LAX was the perfect spot as we returned from a week in Cancun.  We live in Arizona and our flight arrived late, so we decided to stay at the Four Points before driving home the next day and it was the right decision.  We were able to relax and have 1 last night of vacation in a terrific hotel: beds are lovely, room fresh and clean and thank you Peter Kolla, Director of Operations for helping us coordinate our last minute stay.  Peter was helpful, responsive and has a staff that is wonderful! Thank you!;5
"I stayed at this property with my family and had a very nice stay. We had a corner tower room that was unusually large and clean. There was a nice cup full of pretzel rods in the room that we all enjoyed. I went down to the bar for a late dinner and drink and was surprised to see such a huge selection of ""gourmet"" beers. I had a nice conversation with the bartender and got an IPA from a local brewery that was really enjoyable. The kids had a fun dip at the pool--which is surprisingly swank. In short, this is the nicest Four Points I've ever stayed at. I would definitely stay here again. I interacted with numerous members of the staff and everyone was helpful and friendly. It's not the fanciest hotel in the world but one of the friendliest.";5
Helpful, friendly staff.  Really comfortable bed!  and the room was clean and comfortable, just what I needed for an overnight stay before taking flight in the early a.m.  Having a coffeemaker (with a choice of tea as well) made for a comfy evening.  Wifi a big plus, and a comfortable desk at which to catch up on email and work before retiring.  Shuttle service to the airport every 15-20 minutes - all my needs fulfilled!  Extremely convenient and efficient, and at a very reasonable price (especially for LA).;4
I've just returned from a long weekend away in LA and decided to book my stay at this hotel.    I was looking for a hotel in Hollywood or Santa Monica, since that is where I'd spend most of my time, but the rates were really high.  I got a really great rate at this hotel, and since I was renting a car, it really didn't make a difference where I stayed, so I thought why not stay by LAX?   Thankfully I got an early check in (they offer a 24 hour early check-in/late check-out) since my flight was arriving at 9am.  Lucky, too, since I got caught in a rain shower and needed to get changed and cleaned up!  Check in was fast and pleasant.    I stayed with a friend in a deluxe 2 Queen room.  The room was nice...on the older side.  It was also pretty tiny, and the space between the;5
I'm typically a Marriott guy, but a co-worker had already booked here so I followed suit & was surprised with a $79/nt rate at a LAX hotel.  After picking up a rental car from Budget I realized that this hotel was directly across the street.    Quick check-in with the Starwood Preferred Guest line which I had almost forgot that I had signed up years ago.  Got a high floor room for SPG members & 2 free bottles of water in the room - good thing because I've yet to try tap water from any city in CA. $19 for self park is to be expected - they offer valet, but didn't ask for the rate.  Average room size, but had the smallest bathroom I've seen since a stay in Tokyo some years ago.  Restaurant/ bar had good selection of beer & average selection of food - reasonably priced.  Overall,;4
I came here to see my wife off before she left MEPS for 2 days and stayed 1 night so far. My wife got her room free provided by the military and she was on the 7th floor and I got a room on the 6th floor. This room does not heat at all. I turn on the heater for 24 hours and its blowing out cold air the whole time. My room never got over 64F and it got as low at 58F. My wifes room was having the exact same problem. I complained to the front desk and they told me something about the temperatures being regulated and I would have to come back the next day to switch rooms. I had to take a hair dryer and stick it under my covers each time I woke up freezing in the middle of the night. I came there this morning and they told me they were sold out and I would have to come back at 11AM.;1
"Not trying to sound spoiled.. but when I booked the Four Points Sheraton - I thought I was getting the ""SHERATON"".  Needless to say - i didn't know that FOUR PoINTS was the lower category of hotels .. I'd say more like a Holiday Inn/Hilton experience.  So already - after getting dropped off at the Sheraton Gateway (which is also an Airport hotel but the 'nicer Sheraton').. i realized I had booked the wrong hotel.  I should have known when i got a Sheraton LOS ANGELES hotel for $109+tax.. that should have been a sign already.  So already bummed that I went to the wrong hotel - and was asked to walk to the correct one only a block and a half away - we showed up at the Four Points and realized the quality difference.  What made it better was the staff were soo friendly, I got";4
I was flying from NYC to Aukland NZ and wanted to stay overnight at LAX to break up my trip.  I had looked at numerous hotels at LAX and I thought the Four Points would suit me.  I checked various hotel websites for rates including the one for the Four Points but I decided to call them directly  and when I did I was amazed to get an even lower price than I had expected so I booked it for the 1 night I needed.  They have a shuttle bus that picks up passengers and I didm't have long to wait after my arrival.  I was checked in very quickly to Room 613 which although it overlooked a few parking lots there weren't any high buildings in the way and so my room was very bright.  The room had 2 Queen beds and a large bathroom.  After I checked in I went to dinner at the hotel restaurant,;4
My expectations for an airport hotel were low, but what a surprise. Clean room, comfortable bed, quiet night (even though we were directly across the the hall from the elevator). The bar/cafe also served a great late-night meal. Highly recommended.  A note about the airport shuttle: when we were planning to leave for the airport, there were a lot of other people leaving at the same time. We couldn't get on the shuttle and took a cab instead. Not a big deal to us, but something to note if you are relaying on the shuttle only.;5
We flew to LAX a day before our cruise left and just needed a place to overnight before a morning departure.  We were very pleased with our choice.  Everything from the shuttle service in the afternoon to the return shuttle service the next day went smoothly.  The hotel has a great micro brew pub with over 100 beers available, and the food was also very good, although the portions were a bit small.  The room itself was clean and comfortable.  The halls in the public areas were a bit worn and the elevators were slow.  Breakfast was not included in our rate and we found the buffet and a la carte menu were expensive.  Had we bothered to look outside, we would have seen that there were some fast food restaurants within easy walking distance.  We highly recommend this location for an;5
Service was impeccable in all areas provided. Great, convenient location, wonderful family style restaurant and chic sports bar. Great heated pool and cozy cabanas, relax chairs.  Tour company reasonaqbly priced and versatile for your length of stay or interests.  Great conference rooms and the best coffee to enjoy while waiting for your morning shuttle.  Very helpful and considerate staff. The driverfor the tour reminded me of Ricardo Montalban from the past Fantasy Island show.  He was very informative, kept us on schedule and was a vety pleasnat, gracious man.;5
Our company just produced our second workshop event here for an international crowd. the staff is so helpful and generous.  You can't beat the price in the LAX area and the service is everything you could expect from a much pricier hotel.  Eden in the Catering Department is an angel. She always goes above and beyond to make sure everything not only goes as planned but that the overall experience for our staff and participants is impeccable.;5
We had our flight cancel at the last minute. Checked on line and found this hotel for under $100.00. Free shuttle picked us up on arrivals level and were at the hotel in 15 minutes. The hostess at the front desk was wonderful. Her name was Jealessia! She was bright and full of life, After telling her of our ordeal, she gave us a goody bag of 4 big chewy cookies and vouchers for 2 appies at the hotel pub. The room was large and very comfortable. It helped immensely to have this place to relax in after a very tough day.;5
This location has the most helpful staff I have come across in a very long time.  Edith is especially helpful, she actively tries to find ways to be of help.  Every single staff member I came across, even in passing was welcoming and asked if they could be of help.  We have stayed at this location several times, and the main reason we continue to come back is the wonderful staff!;5
Do you want great service? Check Do you want a great value? Check  I could go down the list and tell you that this hotel has it all.  No, it's the the state of the art updated everything kind of hotel.  But it doesn't have to be.  It is clean and everyone is very helpful.  I stayed for 4 nights and in a couple of weeks I will be there for another 4.  I can say that I felt very comfortable staying at this hotel.  The Pool area is also very nice with a soothing water feature. I like the ease of the self-parking and FREE WATER Bottles in my room every day!  That was a very nice touch.   I had breakfast the breakfast buffet at the restaurant and fish tacos in the bar (delicious).  So I can safely say that the food is pretty good and if you like sports, their bar features 16 large;5
I have actually stayed at this hotel a few years back for a family reunion that we hosted back in 2005 and we also recently just celebrated my husbands birthday in the same banquet room (San Diego room).  Now the hotel itself is nice and convenient and affordable BUT I really believe that they should concentrate on updating a number of areas like the hallways, near the elevators- I have to be honest and state that those areas weren't really that clean and hallways looked pretty shabby - its a bit shabby but other than that, I would actually stay here again.  The banquet room we had was nice and accommodating and i HAVE to state that the dinner that was served for the party was EXCELLENT!! (Chicken Marsala - just EXCELLENT) but they did forget to serve all of our guest the ice;3
I arrived at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX tired and ready to crawl into bed.  Imagine my dismay when they couldn't find my reservation.  The concierge desk let me use their computer to pull up my confirmation e-mail.  When I arrived back at the check-in desk Alexis informed me that my reservation was indeed at the Four Points by Sheraton Culver City.  I called the 800 reservation number and they informed me I could not switch my reservation without losing my SPG points.  I was incensed - this was a honest mistake.  Try as I might- I could not get the agent to see my point of view. I was at the point of tears and vowing to never return to a FP ever again.  At this point Alexis offered to call Donna the manager of FPSCC to get her approval to allow me to switch my reservation;5
The best staff from the front desk to housekeeping. Always consistent with every stay. And the food services from the restaurant to room service just gets better and better.  Loved the awesome burger and fries in the bar.;5
We used the Hotel prior to our flight to New Orleans and found the hotel, staff and amenities to be beyond our expectations.  We received an upgrade for our prior Sheraton stays and had a great meal in the restaurant.  Shuttle to and from the airport made the entire experience fabulous.;5
The Four Points is arguably the best location on the LAX hotel strip. Additionally, With very down to earth staff, my stay there was stress free and I look forward to returning. The shuttle tracking board near the main doors is very cool, and helps with timing in the mornings. I was on a longer stay and the staff , especially at the front desk were very helpful. The Food and Beverage choices at the hotel is excellent. However if they are not to your taste, there is a Burger King across the road, InNOut burger about a 10 minute walk, and a whole lot of other options.  Defo coming back.;5
I recently stayed at this hotel and was extremely impressed with the friendly staff and attention to detail.  This was the first time a hotel actually removed all of the feather pillows, bedding etc upon my first request!  I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again.;5
Front desk staff, especially the woman I checked in with, were excellent. Customer Service (I use the term loosely) staff were dour and somewhat aggressive.  The room was old although had a flat screen tv.  The bar was excellent, with over 100 beers and numerous tv's.  The hotel represents better value than other nearby hotels (e.g. Hilton).;3
This is my new favorite LAX airport hotel.  I prefer them even over the more expensive properties nearby.  As an example of the service, this was the only hotel on my multi-city trip that had a room ready for me without feather bedding, as I requested this in advance at all the hotels I stayed at.  The St. Regis and Grand Hyatt made me wait while they de-feathered, but the least expensive hotel of the bunch came through!  Super comfy bed, with high thread-count sheets.  Good restaurant.  Free shuttle.  Overall, excellent value.;5
"We were forced to overnight in a hotel at LA airport given a missed connection - no thanks to United!!  First step is to hail the complimentary shuttle outside the baggage pickup. Fairly uneventful given the day we had had.  Check in went fine as the airline had organized a special ""distressed rate"" for us.   The rooms were tiny. Two double beds in each. With one of the smallest bathrooms possible.  No homey comforts. Just the barest of basics. But given we were essentially going to bed and heading straight back to the airport - it served its purpose.  We did have dinner downstairs in the restaurant. If there is an alternative - take it!  The omelettes were drowned in cheese.  Everything came with potatoes.  Not sure if a vegetable was to be seen anywhere.   Given we had lost";3
My wife and I stayed here over the weekend and we very pleased with the experience. We had stayed here a year earlier and returned. The hotel is well kept and clean. There is some wear and tear showing in the rooms, hallways and bathrooms, but that is OK as there are many nice features in the hotel. The lobby with its open seating, many flat screen TVs and airy feeling are nice touches. The sports baris also a nice place to meet with friends.  We had a corner junior suite which was very large. I would stay here again for the locaiton (free shuttle from LAX) and the great value pricing here. You cant get a better deal at this level of quality. One more thing, management is VERY resonsive to meeting customer needs. Be sure to tell them in advance of any special requests (we had;4
We stayed here one night at the beginning of a trip on a Stay, Park and Fly package.  We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room and the service from the front desk.  It's nothing to brag about, but we've had our fair share of experiences with airport hotels that always leave us wondering what we'll get when we try a new location.  Our kids were able to enjoy the heated outdoor pool, even in January, and we were able to relax and have a beer poolside while they swam.  We were very pleased that the shuttle was prompt and we were able to get on right away.  (We've stayed at another area hotel and had seen the line 2-3 shuttles long, so we avoided that hotel as we did not want to be late to the airport.)  We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant, which was pretty;3
This was just a one night stay before a long haul flight. Booked here as it was cheaper than the Sheraton Gateway. Reception and check in was excellent, very friendly and helpful.Used the 24 hour stay deal and it worked very well as was able to have the late check out confirmed. Guest laundry is a great facility. Pool was nice, it's a shame they do not have a hot tub. Restaurant was very disappointing though, the menu for dinner needs to include more options. Breakfast was included in the room rate, and when we walked in we mentioned that and was rudely told to 'get a voucher'. Got this from reception no problem, then went back in for the smallish but quite good buffet, it has enough of what you need of the usual food & juice (although they could learn from the breakfast buffet;4
I enjoyed my 3rd stay at this hotel and stay there every trip I make to Los Angeles.  Not only are the rooms quiet and comfortable, but more importantly the staff is professional, courteous, and very friendly and helpful.  I enjoy the extensive Beer list in the Lobby Bar...they always seem to have a new one I have never tried every time I go there.   If you like a quality hotel and a great value, you should try the Sheraton Four Points LAX !!!;5
I chose this location because it's close to LAX and has free shuttle bus. Free wifi is definitely a great feature. Check in was smooth and the room is clean and nice, although the bathroom does not have fancy shower or tub. The bed is comfortable with a lot of pillows around. A free magazine with L.A. map is helpful and it is on the table. I took it with me so I have no trouble navigating the freeway network. I can see planes landing from the window but it does not bother me at all and I was able to sleep during the day and night without any problem.;4
This property is a stone's throw away from LAX and a very nice property for business travelers. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. Room was very nice, not great views but compensated for by the location and service.;4
Stayed one night after landing late at LAX.  Airport shuttle was prompt.  Friendly check in agent.  Got upgraded to a junior suite.  The clean room is large with a sitting area, coffee maker, free wifi and comfortable bed.  Also reasonably priced.  Definitely worth staying.;5
I like staying in this hotel for it's convenience.. the hotel shuttle comes around every few minutes from the airport.. the rooms are clean and quiet, the pub in the lobby has a great variety of beers on tap, and all the rental car companies are just down the street a short walk away.;4
I stayed here for one night ahead of a early morning flight from LAX.  I was only in the room a total of 8 hours so I was really only there to sleep.  Check in was quick and the lobby and common areas looked nice.  However, upon arriving at the room it was a different story.  The room looked as if the beds had been made and toiletries replaced, but no real cleaning done.  Walking around without my shoes I could feel the dirt buildup on the carpet and the bed sheets felt rough and as if they hadn't been properly washed.  I also found stray long hairs on the floor of the bathroom and dirt under the rim of the toilet.  Overall the stay was functional, but I do not think I would return given the condition of my room and as there are plenty of other options around LAX.;2
"Our room was at the end of an unlit unoccupied hallway. It was very scary to get to and we were not comfortable. All but 1 elevator was broken and that one was scary to be in because it felt like it was on it's way out too.  The ""shuttle"" the hotel advertises going to Manhattan Beach and El Segundo is actually a 3 block walk through a questionable neighborhood. The hotel sold us tickets, kind of waved us down the street and didn't bother to tell us that the shuttle had already done it's last pick up. The shuttle was the ENTIRE reason we picked this hotel and would have stayed elsewhere had their website not been so deceptive.  I was very uncomfortable here and would NEVER reccommend it to anyone.";1
We stayed the day before our morning flight. Check in went smoothly. The shuttle as very efficient.    We were going out of town for 3 days so we used the parking structure across the street at Airport Center. We pre-booked the parking on the internet and it was half the cost of hotel parking. The hotel has a park and fly package, but it is designed for people who need 7 days of parking, so it didn't make sense for us. Our room was on the preferred guest level which was, thankfully, on a high floor of the west tower. We had an odd number room, which ended up being a problem. There are a few gigantic rental car return lots outside this side of the hotel. These lots are VERY bright (flood lights) and quite loud.   I will return, however,  I will simply ask for an even numbered;4
My stay at Sheraton was brief but pleasant. I was just passing through LA and needed to stay close to the airport and at a hotel that provided a shuttle to and from.  The driver of the shuttle was professional and did not hesitate to help me with my luggage. The staff at check in desk were very helpful and courteous.  Very professional.  I had arrived way before the regular check in time and my room had not been ready.  The check in agent notified housekeeping and asked them to put a rush on readying the room for check in and I had to wait just an hour.  It was much appreciated because I had just come off a 12 hour flight from Australia.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who may be staying in LA.;5
The service was very nice. Perhaps the carpets just needed to be cleaned. The location was good for getting to and from the airport, and the airport shuttle was timely and the driver was polite and professional. The exercise area was nice, with a lot of machines and it was open 24 hours a day. Despite being close to the airport, it was not noisy at night.;3
What a great place to stay near the airport. Had a great craft beer bar, clean and well appointed rooms, quiet rooms and a shuttle to the airport. I was greeted with courtesy on check-in, given an upgraded room and helped with arranging dinner for the night.  What more could you want?;5
I only stayed for one day on my way through LAX, but found the hotel offered great value, and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. My room was spotlessly clean, comfortable and quiet. The internet was fast and free, and easily connected. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in LA and needing to be near the airport.;5
We've been looking for a great park and fly hotel out of LAX for awhile, something with great value for the money.  When we found Four Points by Sheraton, we knew we'd found our spot!  It was close to LAX and had a great hotel shuttle service.  There were inexpensive packages for parking our car for 1-2 weeks while we traveled.  The staff was great, the service was 5-star service, everyone was helpful and friendly.  The room was very clean and quiet.  One of the best and most unique parts (that we've been raving to friends about) was the hotel bar!  They had a HUGE selection of international beer.  We will be making this our go-to place from now on.;5
This is the second time we have stayed at the Sheraton Four Points in LA.  The location is excellent.  We travel with our small dog and have been made very welcome.   Service on check in was amazing with  the desk clerk remembering us from 3 months ago - very friendly. Service is excellent, especially in the Sports bar, great food, amazing selection of beers and very attentive waiter - Thanks Adrienne .  We were upgraded to a large room.  Everything was very good except the bathroom.  It was for a handicapped person (we are not) and the shower was a bit of a problem as the water kept flooding the bathroom!!  Other than that we were very happy and will continue to stay there on our trips from Canada to Mexico.;5
We used points to book the room, which was a great deal, as it only took 4,000.  The Sheraton & Westin LAX were 7,000/night.  The rooms were newly renovated and fresh, and we received an upgrade to a corner room at the end of the hallway, which was very quiet.  The shuttle was super convenient and took the stress out of driving to the airport.  The food in the restaurant was acceptable, though not quick.  Room service was prompt.  All in all, it was a very comfortable stay.;4
"If room 402 did not have plumbing problem, you would have gained ""very good"". Even if you shut off the water in the bath tub, faucet is leaking water. Appreciated upgrade as SPG though. It is a good Airport Hotel.";3
Hotel is very nice, staff is very polite and kind but rooms are paper thin and every morning people leaving their rooms disturbs other people.. almost every morning there were doors slamming, stuff banging and it was annoying... I work at a hotel, I know how it works but the noise and rooms need a major makeover. Bathroom is small but other than that the room was nice. my biggest complaint is the noise..  the parking could be a little cheaper for hotel guests but it was convenient in terms of parking.;3
Complicated travel plans had us stay a night between flights.  Shuttle was great, parking convenient and staff was very helpful and responsive.  Renovations showed through out (compared to a stay 1 1/2 years ago!). Rooms and common areas were very pleasant.  This is a comfortable hotel.  ask about the park and stay packages.  we parked for a week here with the one night reservation. I would suggest to anyone needing an easy stop near LAX....;4
The Hotel Staff was very helpful and reminder me that I could have a late check out..  I was able to make my appointment with out the stress of getting check out before my meeting.  I had time to work in the privacy of my room and take a shuttle to the airport..  The resturant Staff could use a little help though.;4
Consistently great value stay every time we come to Los Angeles. The hotel is very convenient for LMU and it’s within driving distance of countless shopping areas and restaurants. The staff are very friendly and considerate – always recognising us as past guests. On this particular trip, we checked in at 9am (check in is noon) and they were able to get us into our room immediately. Coming straight off a 15 hour flight, it was very much appreciated! Unfortunately, we booked a rental car prior to our visit (as the rental location was just minutes from the hotel), but found out upon arrival that there’s a car rental on property! We’ll definitely use it during our next trip. We finished off a few evenings in Brewster’s, the hotel bar, where we had some delicious food and drink. You;5
The elevators a sluggish and there are plastic cups in the bathrooms, but the rooms are bright and comfortable, internet is free and efficient, complimentary bottled water and newspapers, excellent food in the restaurants, friendly and helpful staff, self-service laundry, easy park-and-fly deals, free airport shuttle, simple access to freeways and key surface streets. All in all, a great place to spend a few nights visiting LA.;4
Stayed twice in the last month. Start we're friendly and helpful but this hotel needs some love and care. The hotels surround the Four Points look fresh and modern. This hotel has very limited eating options and to our amazement said they had no bread to offer with soup during lunch time.  The rooms are well sized but are also tired, as are the bathrooms.  Helpful and pleasant staff can not paper over the tired feel to this hotel.  You can do better!;3
Arrived at hotel about 2.30pm, checkin was smooth and very friendly. The room was in West Tower and had views over to the city and mountains. We had an excellent view of the planes coming in, which did not disturd us at all.  The rooms were fantasic, so large, fresh, bedding just right. Room had fridge, internet with no charge. Food in the restaurant was lovely and fairly priced, we ate at dinner time and buffet breakfast, every day.  I had read that staying at LAX would be a problem, this was not a problem we hired a car, and even going to Universal Studios on a Saturday was so easy. The Westfield Century City mall is only 3.3. miles away, for all shopping.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, well trained, friendly staff, led by what  must be the best General;5
I was visiting with my 9 and 8 year old grand daughters. I took them to breakfast on 1/7. The entire staff could not do enough for them. I made my morning a breeze. I was staying in 204 and the room was perfect. The room was spotless. Your front desk was helpful with parking and was very courteous and efficient;5
I booked this hotel as a overnight prior to an early morning next day flight.  Check in was pleasant but a pain in the neck due to having 2 sleeping kids in the car plus CC issues so my wife and I had to swap places since the reservation was originally in my name.  Nothing on staff.  The bellman was excellent in helping me get the massive amount of junk you need to travel with small children. (2 car seats, stroller plus multiple bags).  I got lucky and the AVIS lot was 2 blocks down so returning the car didn't mean a round trip on 2 different shuttles.  The room itself was decently sized, furnishings were newer in and in good shape.  The only 2 complaints I had was bathroom cleanliness (soap scum in shower etc) and the size of the toilet stall was a bit on the smallish size.;3
We have stayed at this hotel on every visit to, or through, L.A. The reason is quite simple, service, from the front desk to the maids to the bar staff and to the restaurant people, all make you feel like they are enjoying you being their guest. Need some help with a tour, see the concierge, no problem. Shuttle to and from the airport is an added blessing, but it is, without a doubt, the total staff all being eager to please that brings us back, not to mention the best selection of craft,domestic plus a huge array of imported beers that make for an enjoyable evening chatting with fellow guests at the bar area. Value for what a traveller wants is prime, and this hotel offers it all.;5
"Overall, it seems like a nice hotel on the surface. Beds comfortable and restaurants had good food (albeit expensive). Airport shuttle was convenient. But the whole place seemed under staffed and slow to respond to guest needs. Our biggest gripe was the incompetent housekeeping staff. Every day (3 nights) we were missing something different: towels, washcloths, rug, soap. And the other couple we were staying with had the same problem. Then when we called the front desk, it took 45+ mins to get the towels brought to the room. Also, the hotel displays signage to ""be green, reuse your towels"" -- we followed the instructions and hung them up and the staff still took them away. Stand behind your policies and double check your work before moving to the next room! Other issues: only";2
After a long flight from Sydney we headed to the Hotel in one of their free bus shuttles, nothing is free as you must know by now in the USA as everybody and let me tell you, EVERYBODY expects a good tip from a traveller...so keep the $5 dollar notes handy and add them all at the end of the day to have a real cost... We arrive at the hotel at around 8 am, as their check in time is 11 am, we are charged US$40 for the extra 3 hours on that day, even though their website has an offer of 24 hour check in no extra charges....(?) After given the keys to our room we take the lift and find ourselves looking for it in the third floor on our own...the place is really tired and on the industrial side of things, basic..not suitable even for a family on a one day stop over... After 3 hours i;2
We decided to stay at 4 Points because of the proximity to LAX and their park, sleep, fly package. Sleep one night and park your car in covered parking for up to 14 days. It doesn't get any better than this. We stayed the night before our flight on a 10 day holiday. The hotel was better than expected with exception of no free breakfast. Sparkling clean and staff was very friendly and helpful. Room with two queens was requested at back of hotel for quiet. This is where the flight crews stay and it was extremely quiet. Room was well appointed and top rate. Bed was firm and had foam or down pillows. We didn't use the restaurant or pool but both looked as nice as the rest of the hotel. Shuttle every 15 minutes was a plus. I would highly recommend this hotel.;5
The last place we would normally stay is a Sheraton but because we had an early morning flight from LAX to  Miami, just before Christmas, we decided to drive from San Diego & stay here.  The best part of the deal is they will allow you to park in their lot without charge for up to  10 days if that is the deal you negotiate when reserving the room.  We normally pay approx. $13. per day for parking at LAX & this room was about $150. with parking & breakfast included.  We parked for 10 days so it was a really good deal!  Had to write a review because the front desk staff couldn't have been nicer & more accomodating - even more so than some 5 star hotels we have stayed at!  The front desk mgr. who comes on approx. 3:00 (the date was Dec. 7th & unfortunately, we didn't get his name);4
The hotel staff is always friendly and efficient. The hotel is clean and welcoming. Rooms are comfortable. Bed is especially comfortable with nice linens Airport shuttle runs every 15 min. I usually stay coming and going  from family trips having late/early flights. I feel safe and well taken care of.;5
This is the second time in as many years that I've stayed at this property.  I found the maintenance slipping and the outside structure in need of cleaning, painting, awning replacement and window washing.  The windows in my room were getting filthy.  The elevators are slow and I discovered some of the glass in the bulletin board doors inside the elevators had been vandalized and broken.  Surprisingly, the housekeeping staff is excellent.  The bedding was clean and fresh as was the room in general and the bathroom.  No complaints there.  The A/C & Heat thermostatic controls and air handling unit for the room is getting antiquated and doesn't function very well.  This hotel charges about $20/day to use their parking lot and then you will have a tough time finding a space,;2
I booked a night at the Four Points Sheraton LAX because I had an early flight the next morning. My main incentive for choosing this hotel was because it was close & they offered a special rate that included 14 nights of free parking with a 1 night stay. Firstly, the gentleman who booked my reservation was very patient and helpful in finding me the best rate among all of the starwood hotels in the area. Check in was prompt & pleasant. I didn't have to wait for the shuttle on the way OR returning from the airport. When I returned my parking ticket worked with no hassle. The entire stay went smooth and made my travel so much easier. I will definitely return.;5
Great deal for $67. Could not stay anywhere for that. Even Travelodge and Super 8 were more. The room was Clean. The hotel very busy. The shuttle got us to LAX in a flash for a 6 AM flight. The hotel is older,,,,but clean. The room was 59 degrees. Maintenance came in 20 minutes and fixed the problem quickly. Would stay again for a night before and early flight.;3
The hotel was easily accessible right from LAX, via free shuttle.  The hotel is beautiful and has free fitness center, pool. The bar/grill is open late and the food and service is very good.  The rooms were very comfortable and nicely updated.  Hotel is very accessible to persons with disability or limited mobility.  Most reasonable rate in town for the high quality!;5
Very impressed with the hotel's cleanliness, and great location. Most impressed with entire staff...Martin gave great directions to get to the ocean. Also very comfortable bar atmosphere as well, with friendly talkative bartenders and great bar food.;5
The hotel is in a great location with easy access to all areas of Los Angeles.  The restaurant had excellent food (especially the fish tacos).  Comfortable and clean rooms.  What stood out the most however was the excellent staff.  Everyone had a smile and was very eager to help.  The front desk manager, Adam, was especially outstanding.  He made sure our special needs were accomodated in an extremely professional yet personal and friendly manner.;5
Booked here for the last night of my US trip.  Convenient to & fro LAX (free shuttle).  There's also another shuttle where you pay USD 5 (if I can remember correctly) which takes you to Manhattan Beach & some shopping mall and some other places, it's like a hop on hop off type of thing, so quite good value.   No complaints during my stay but nothing great either, just very average comparing to other Starwood properties.  Reservations made by PA who is Starchoice & SPG to chalk points & she usually gets me free upgraded rooms but not here, doesn't bother me as it is only a short stay by myself but it would have been nicer if I did.;4
We booked the hotel just for one night, basically just to sleep in as we arrived late and had an early flight the next morning. Once we got to our room, we were greeted with a loud humming noise. We called the front desk and they sent up an engineer. He told us he wasn't sure what the noise was- probably a problem with the air conditioning vent.   We were then told to go downstairs, and we're subsequently given a different room. The noise wasn't much better here, and combined with a broken shower and moldy bath tub, as well as questionable sheets, our stay was pretty awful.   Also, the rooms have windows out in to the hallway, so you could hear, and see, the people walking by.   The complementary shuttle to the airport was the only saving grace, along with the staff being happy;2
"A great location near LAX, but you will also hear planes coming and going all the time too. I've stayed here twice, for one night each, and the sole reason was so that I could park my car here at no charge. About 5 years ago I stayed one night and was able to leave my car here for 14 nights at no extra cost. I stayed here in Dec. 2012 and did the same, but this time I think I got 10 free nights. I used my AAA discount and the room was $149. When I checked in, I was upgraded to the ""Deluxe"" room because I was a Starwood Preferred member. The deluxe has plenty of space, but not much else. Carpet and furniture looked old and in need of upgrading, and the bed was hard and not that comfortable. I've stayed in Sheratons that had awesome comfy beds and pillows, but not this one.  The";3
This is a terrific property that you can tell has great management and tries really hard.  An attractive lobby greets you and the front desk staff is terrific and welcoming.  The rooms are very nice having been recently remodeled.  If you're a platinum guest with Starwood you are welcomed with wonderful cookies!  The pool is very nice, resort like.  The restaurant and bar are solid.  Internet is good.    I tell you, this hotel is I think the top 1 or 2 at LAX.  It is without a doubt, the best value in Los Angels.  My only nit, and this is totally subjective and personal, I'm not a fan of Four Points bathroom amenities.  They're just to sugary sweet smelling for me.;5
This is a convenient stop for business travelers. The restaurant and pub have good (not great) food and you can get in and out quickly if you have to hit the road for meetings. Comfortable rooms and great service by the staff.;4
when checking I was told because I am a silver member I got a free room upgrade. when I walked in I was speechless. absolutely. amazing. THe bed was by far the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. I will be returning soon;5
I stayed at the 4 Points LAX in early Dec. for 24 hours layover between Florida and Australia. checked in at 8:00pm and checked our 8:00pm the next day a nice innovation. I had a long wait for the shuttle and after visiting one other hotel it drops you off at the 4 Points. Staff at check in were OK but nothing outstanding. Lots of airline crews coming and going. The bar has 110 beers and I hadnt heard of any of them! Would be nice just to have a burger and Bud before bed instead of some wanky beer menu. Room was quite small but bed were very comfortable. Bathroom was tiny, no elbow room on the toilet. Shower though had good pressure and was hot. Decor was fairly new. No noise except the neighbours TV in the early evening. Our key didnt work on the second afternoon but was;4
Stayed 10/12-11/12. A very well-oiled property. A four star property but everything worked. The extremely nice check-in with warm welcome, the comfortable room with much needed comp bot water, the friendly frequent lax shuttle, the general security and even the out-sourced concierge, everything worked! A true hotelier at work, can feel that the GM do work from the ground up.;5
Took advantage of their stay and fly package in Dec 2012. Have used this package two other times. Found a great parking place that I thought would be secure near the rear entrance to the hotel against the building.  Got a call from the hotel 2 days after I left informing me that my rear window was broken.  A empty bottle of Jack Daniels was either thrown through the window or dropped from one of the rooms above.  Hotel declined all responsibility but did put some plastic over the window to keep the rain out.  Repair was $900+ making this a very expensive place to stay and park.   Hotel is clean and service is good, love the restaurant in the bar downstairs, but the vandalism of my car 30 feet from a major entrance will make me think twice about using this hotel again.;4
I missed a connecting flight with AA and was offered a cheap rate to stay at this hotel instead of the airport for 16 hours till the next flight. There was a free shuttle which ran every 15 minutes from each terminal to the hotel and I got there quickly. I paid 60 or 70$US for the night and it was worth it. The young girl at check in was nice and friendly, room was clean with free WIFI and queen sized bed very comfortable. It had all the amenities in the bathroom and everything else you expect in a hotel like this. (lcd tv, desk, couch, coffee, hairdryer) It's across the road from Burger King but the hotel also had a bar and restaurant with room service. I checked out at 4am and the staff was again very friendly and it was a good experience. I've stayed in the Crown LAX which;5
This hotel was perfect for a stopover on our way back to the east coast.  Shuttle was timely, coming and going and the staff was very courteous.  Elena was friendly and checked us in expeditiously. They have made good use of the room design as it is an older property.  The room was clean and tidy.  The beds were very comfortable. We were happy to be able to get a meal/snack and a beverage at their pub on the premises.  I believe they are open as late as 1:00 a.m.;4
This property is an excellent value for the room rate, especially if you're a AAA member. Overnight parking fees are almost half that of surrounding properties, the restaurant offers a wide selection of beers, and the airplane noise is very slight.   The only negative is this property seems to have the SLOWEST elevators in CA!;4
This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. The first was a business trip and I was very impressed with the hotel. So on a personal trip we stayed here the night before flying home. It was a great stay!  We dropped off the rental car and were taken to the hotel. This saved us time in the morning, but also the $19 to self park at the hotel. We checked in and got a beer at the bar, which has the most extensive amount of beers I have ever seen at a hotel bar.  I think the number was 50-100 different beers. Up to the room where we ordered room service. Bedding was comfortable, even the pillows, and the room was clean and spacious. Front desk staff and concierge very helpful and nice. We were lazy the next morning and ordered room service for breakfast. The corned beef hash;4
"Stayed for wonderful ""24 hour check in"" on way to and from Sydney. Worth the break after a long flight and meant arrived in final destination  ( NY) next day in a good refreshed state.  Stayed in both types of room levels and both were comfortable , adequately maintained and  had adequate space. Comfortable beds and a quiet space meant a good night's sleep. Pay extra if you can justify better room layout but both were comfortable, clean and restful.  Great , friendly  personalised service - particularly for a large busy hotel. Food on site Ok, nothing special but adequate . Breakfast off menu more interesting than buffet. Staff in restaurant could not have been more helpful.  Recommend using ""town car service "" for long trips to places like Universal studios. $72 including tips";4
"I went for a whirlwind tour to my Uni and being pregnant I was a bit concerned about many issues of travelling so far and being able to enjoy my stay and being close enough to the airport to get morning sleep on the way out and get to bed on the way there. I really need to commend the hotel. I was initially told that they had a charge for delivery of packages and I LOVE SHOPPING IN USA. I actually came with an empty suitcase for a stay of about a week.   I was irate to find out there was a charge to accept a package; having travelled the world this is a courtesy which you normally get and are simply expected to tip the concierge. I did express my dismay and they did, without telling me, leave any charge off my room charge. Not only that they gave me a HUGE suite and it was";4
My stay was wonderful. The staff was friendly and the environment was clean . I  would highly recommend if you are going to Los Angeles to stay there. You will be pleased with everything. I found the experience a positive one.;5
We booked a dayroom as we arrived very early on LAX and our connecting flight departed late that evening.  Very complete and comfortable room. Spacious, working possibilities. Bathroom was a bit small, but workable. Smooth check in and check out, reasonable rate, excellent shuttle service and nice bar.;4
Four Points LAX was easily one of the nicest places I have stayed. I am not a person that needs top luxury but I like to be comfortable for a good price. Four Points was incredibly clean, had all the facilities I needed, FREE INTERNET, a lovely pool area, good food, and some of the nicest staff I have ever dealt with. I would stay there any time I am in Los Angeles. The rooms were very nice, very clean and the beds were so comfortable. For the price I paid, (a package through Expedia) I got way more than I deserved. As a side a note, the rooms don't have a fridge, but you can request one!;5
I have stayed here about 6 trips now.  LMU is just up the street and it is very close to the airport.  Very reasonable cost relative to the Sheraton and the Westin just down the street.  The hotel is very clean and easy to get around.  Restaurant is easy for breakfast and the kids have liked dinner there in the past.  The fridge in the room is a plus. The elevators are a bit bouncy which can startle you the first time you take them.  On the most recent visit there was a banquet in the facility and the parking was a challenge but other than that, a normal easy visit.;4
Upon our arrival (which was late) everything just fell into place.  The room was very comfortable...the staff were attentive and the food in the restaurant (breakfast) was very good.  The hotel is a great choice if you need to be near LAX...;4
"I'm not a regular at Sheraton's but the price and location were right for our 1 night stay before flying back East. Great shuttle (free) service to LAX.....decent room with small bathroom and view of the parking lot. Would NOt want to stay longer due to the cramped bathroom and smallish room with no drawers to unpack into, and no microwave. There was a small fridge and decent tv....lovely pool and lobby. One big annoyance.....computers in lobby were not free....$4.95 per 15 minutes.....WHAT????? Also no free coffee available in the am and restaurant charged $16 for ""buffet"" breakfast that was VERY basic and no omelette station. Internet IS free in the rooms if you have your own computer...to have to pay in the lobby is inconsistent and rather ridiculous....I'll keep my loyalties";3
I am not used to very good LAX hotel experiences. The Four Points was better than what I would normally expect from a hotel in this area. The staff was nice and friendly, even late at night.  Close to the terminal on Airport blvd, the hotel is right next to the Budget, Hertz, car rental lots. Parking is 19$ / night.  Rooms are what you would expect from a Four Points: well appointed and clean.  The bar was quite good with a vast selection of beers.  Did not use the shuttle. Good free wifi connection.;4
My husband and I have stayed at this hotel every year, sometimes twice a year, since 2001 when our daughter graduated from USC. We stay every Christmas for a few days. This year I accidently booked a room equipped to serve people with disabilities. Although they did not have to honor the rate I booked the room for, the reservation staff made short work of changing the room, with a friendly e-mail to confirm the change. We have found the staff always cheerful, love to sit in the lobby and watch the airlines' flight crews check in and love the happy hour. And it is convenient to the airport and rental cars. The pool is nice.;5
I am a Starwood Preferred member and was treated horribly.  It started wtih the shuttle - it drove straight past me despite my waving my arms at it like a wild woman and being in the right zone for the shuttle buses.  I called the hotel and they said they would have the driver circle back around for me right away.  25 minutes later it showed up.  Meanwhile, every other major hotel chain had at least three shuttles go by in that time.  Then I got to the hotel.  I stood in the Starwood Preferred line and got my room key.  I walked to my room and discovered it is in a wing that is very old and strange.  The hallway has windows on both sides.  Yep, both sides.  Big windows looking outside.  And on the other side, big windows making the wall of each room.  The beds are pushed right;1
Nice park and fly rate that included small but clean room and 14 days of parking.  The pool was a nice added touch for the family - it's heated.  Great location for an early flight and the shuttle goes every 15 minutes or so.;4
While not a 5 star hotel it is great value. I used my Starwood points to book a two night weekend stay. I didn't spend much time in my hotel and did not use any of the amenities so I can't write a thorough review. I can say the location to LAX and a major rental car company as well as the cost makes this a easy recommendation.;4
Nice room and great pool area and bar. I always stay here when I am in and out of LA quickly because it is right at the airport an flying out on an am flight is a breeze. The bar has a great beer selection and the staff is quite knowledgeable about what they have to offer.;5
I had a wonderful stay at the Four Points by Sheraton at LAX last week.  This was my second visit to this property.  First of all, the hotel is located only a couple of blocks away from both the airport and the Hertz rental car lot, making it ideal for an easy arrival and drop off of luggage.  When I drove up I was warmly greeted and directed to the reception area, where again, I was greeted by a friendly member of the staff who already had a room waiting for me, even though it was only 12:30 p.m. (normal check in is around 3:00 p.m.).  The room was wonderful, very clean and nicely appointed with a wonderfully comfortable king size bed.  I was driving around, quite a bit during this trip, so I only had the opportunity to sample the food at Brewster's, where I had a delicious;5
You can get a great stay at Four Points LAX  if you are willing to plan ahead a bit. Here's a few tips how: Start by saving $20 and park 1 block north on the street, 5 minute walk if that. The staff at Four Points LAX have always been great. I stay there 1-2 nights per month this year. Ask for a room away from the elevator or stairs and for the most remodeled section of the hotel. Become a member of Starwood Points and you too can get the occasional gourmet cookies and beer vouchers upon check in. The bottom line, it has a lot of great value for it's rate compared to any other hotel in LA. Oh, it also has free wi-fi!;5
King room nice size, comfortable bed, noise level acceptable. Bathroom has been update with subway tile and new fixtures but the actual tub is old, but decent shower pressure.  Shuttle very easy just go out the door stand under red sign and wait 2-10 minutes for the shuttle marked Four points and Westin (blue)  ( NOT the one that says sheraton/park yellow).  Convient, safe and quick airport pickup. Pool and pool area including cabans very nice. Free Wiifii great as other hotels in the area charge.;3
Baltazar, the hotel clerk, was very courteous and professional.   He not only treated me to a bag of gourmet cookies, vouchers for free microbrews at the bar and a free breakfast at the restaurant (excellent Spanish omelet and service there, too), but he also upgraded me to a junior suite with a super comfortable king bed with luxurious linens.   Instant hot water in the bathroom was great.    This hotel's swimming pool (about half Olympic size) is the biggest and best in the area.   I had it all to myself Sunday a.m.   It's always heated perfectly (not too warm or cold). The leather couches and chairs in the lounge area are great.    The whole hotel staff are professional and very friendly and accommodating.    I highly recommend joining the Starwood program and staying at his;5
We stayed at this hotel with our spg points. It was disappointing that they charge $20 for uncovered self-parking space. We liked the size of the room and that's why they got 3 stars instead of 2. The restroom needs some update. It was as clean as I would like it to be. We heard all TV noise and stairecase all night so obviously walls are thin. It is a standard brand hotel with not much characteristics. But the distance from the airport was another convenience on top of the size of the room.;3
I chose this hotel because it is linked to Sheraton (a brand that I know) and it's close to the airport. Silly me!! My staying there was quite weird. First of all, my door was opened twice while I was in the room. As soon as they realized I was there they closed the door right away. No one apologized or explained what happened. Was it a housekeeper? Security? A manager? I have no idea! Thing is, I didn't feel safe at all in that place. I was afraid to take a nap or a shower and someone go inside the room again and steal my stuff. I went outside to smoke and when I returned to the hotel the door didn't open in my room. I had to call the receptionist, who sent someone from security to see what happened. Luckily I had my passport with me cause he asked me to prove that that was;2
I travel for business eight months out of the year and finding the right hotel in any given situation is important. The Four Points Sheraton LAX is the best choice when flying out of LAX. I have been staying there many years and for the best complete stay (service, comfort, convenience, peace of mind and value) there is no hotel in the area that comes close. During my last stay I was en route to Thailand. As always the wake up call came through, the coffee in the room is good and the bellman was there in moments to pick up my luggage. I stopped for a quick breakfast and I was off on the shuttle. This was a hassle free stay and upon my return from Thailand I will return to FPS for a stay before relocating to another hotel in Hollywood for a meeting. The Staff makes the real;5
Wow, each time my family and I come here it just gets better and better. When we have a morning flight is is so easy to spend the night and have the shuttle take us to the airport. Refrig, coffee maker in room. Room is always immaculate, service for the breakfast buffet was amazing. They make an outstanding chilaquiles. Coffee or cappucino or latte from the coffee shop in the lobby was included in my breakfast buffet. Really? Really. If you need to have a convenient start point to your trip you must choose this hotel. LOVE, LOVE,  LOVE IT !!!!!!!;5
It's clean, nice and the housekeeper always cleaned the room. Only thing that bothered me was 20 $ parking charged for each day.  I came to LA for first time from Texas and I found it real pricy..............;4
Someting for every class of visitors.  A perfect location for a quick arrival and departure.  Very good food available along with outstanding Customer Service.  Rooms to die for, with or without an airport view.  Perfect in every way.;5
Our stay was fantastic because of Jealesia, one of your front desk employees. We were visiting on our honeymoon and she sent a congratulations card from the front desk, along with some cookies and milk (after she found out we didn't drink alcohol!). This act of kindness, along with her patience and wonderful customer service, went a long way. Thank you for making our honeymoon great!;5
This hotel is very nice. Our first time in LA so we didnt know our way around at all. The staff was warm and friendly and the hotel was very clean. The restaurant was a little pricey but we didnt spend much time there and we ate at surrounding area places. Im not sure I would have stayed here if I had to pay regular rates. I got a discounted rate through my employer so it was well worth it.;4
Completely happy with our choice.  Hubby and I have stayed before for an early morning flight and based on that experience chose to do it again.  They gave us a full two weeks parking which completely off set the cost of staying here.  The drop off buses were convenient. Room was comfortable and we had a great night sleep knowing we were 5 minutes from LAX  instead of the hours in commuter traffic!  We have not been disappointed.;5
My daughter and I had to leave for our trip early due to hurricane sandy....we needed a hotel near the airport for 2 days until our original hotel could accommodate us. We picked this hotel and was pleasantly surprised.  Our room wasn't ready as we arrived very early and very tired...we feel asleep on the couches in the lobby until our room was ready...loved the room and especially the pillows!!! I will order them online for my daughter! It was clean too...one thing I was a little disappointed in was due to another snow storm our flight was cancelled and went back to this hotel at the end of our trip and the room was not the same as the first time??room 537. Must have been an older part of the hotel...didn't want to complain as we were only there 2 nights but if it was longer I;4
Staff is very nice and the location is great for an early morning flight out of LAX. The rooms are clean but dated. This is reflected in the price, as it should be. Very quiet for being so close to an airport.;3
I love the comfortable beds and ample rooms with windows and sunshine. Nice pool if its warm enough to swim outside. I arrive early and generally get an early checkin which is essential after a 15 hour flight and the shuffle through customs. Sometimes I pay extra for a late check out as my outbound flight is generally late at night.   I am a Starwood member so I get the newly renovated rooms.;4
"We are Starwood members, but Sheraton Gateway was too expensive to spend less than 12 hrs. at LAX, so decided to stay at the Four Points.  One always thinks of the Four Points as the ""step-sister"" to the Sheratons and Westins.  Well, we didn't find it to be a step-sister at all, but a very comfortable, clean, inviting hotel.  It had everything you could want and more, from check-in to check-out.  Bed was super comfortable, great flat-screen TV, good bathroom and shower, very clean, attractive, and the staff was most hospitable and welcoming.  We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay and would definitely return and recommend this hotel to anyone.";5
This hotel was pretty average.  Rooms were okay. Service was slow.  The bar was pretty good. Not the best of locations although it is convenient to the airport.  Not much else to say other than just average.;3
"I stayed here for business on November 7-9, 2012.  Let me start with the positives...First time I stepped in the hotel lobby, I felt pretty good about the hotel...it smells ""clean.""  And the lobby overlooking the pool area looks really inviting.  It's also wonderful that WiFi is free!!!  I can actually do work in the comfort of my hotel room without paying for the extra $$ for WiFi!!!  The lobby looked nice, comfortable and inviting.  The room I stayed in was clean, although the duvet had some holes (looks like cigarette burns).  The bed and pillows were comfy.  The check in was excellent and fast...the front desk staff (her name starts with Jae-, I don't remember the rest), was super friendly.  She even gave us directions to the mall!!!  When I returned to my hotel room, I";3
We had a 1-night stay prior to an outbound flight at this LAX hotel location. We are Starwood Vacation Property owners and thus, usually stay at Starwood hotels. This FourPoints Sheraton is a cool little place with great location...ambience...restaurant/pub with an incredible selection (HUGE) of craft, micro brew beers and great food. Staff goes beyond the call to assist...be friendly and provide classic Starwood 5 Star service. Everyone, from the lobby greeter, bellstaff...security....front desk manager....wait staff in resturant...all superior! AND....the fact that we were able to stay there the night before flight...leave our car in secure lot for the 8 days we were away, have FREE to/from airport shuttle service and do ALL that for just a tad over $200 was a super value. I;5
Spent one night here as we were flying out of LAX the following day.   Check in was efficient and my Starwood Gold status recognised and offered all the benefits this brings. Room was simply furnished and clean.   We ate in the Comfort restaurant for dinner. Waited a while for the food. The service was average as was the taste of some of the dishes. After dinner we had a drink in Brewsters Bar which was good. Also good for people watching but less said about that the better!  I had booked room and breakfast which entitles you to the breakfast buffet. Choice of food at the breakfast buffet is very limited and once its gone it isn't replenished it appeared.   Our room was on the Starwood Preferred Guest seventh floor. As the top floor in the hotel we must have been below the air;3
I took advantage of the FOUR POINTS LAX Park and Travel program for a business trip and was completely delighted with my experience.  Not only is it a great value for a longer trip to leave your car there, but the hotel accommodations were excellent.  Best pillows on the bed which made the quick overnight a pleasure.  The room was very nice and clean and well appointed.  The ammenities in the Restaurant and Bar are beautiful.  It is all upscale.  The check in person was helpful and extremely friendly.  I will definitely do it again.;5
By far my worst experience as a Starwood platinum guest.  being restricted to 15 minute of Internet use over  a 24 hour period. We couldn't even print an email without being charged and we could not log off and then log back on again for another 15 minutes. NEVER AGAIN.;1
No mater how many times I stay here I still love it.   Everything goes perfectly well.   clean rooms. Super comfy beds. Cold refrigerators in the rooms. Nice pool area and pool beds. All the hard products at this hotel are great. But what are the hard products with out the soft products and by this I mean the staff.  they simply excel.   Martin and Juan are So friendly and professional,  Terese at the Bell desk always takes her time to recommend attractions and local options  for hotel guests. Everyone's smiles and says hello !  When you combine both elements you have a quality hotel where the staff care about the guest and do what they can to make the stay pleasant.   This hotel is a winner !;5
This hotel has achieved my highest recommendation.  They found out about the housing  delima our dive team was having for a meet against UCLA and contacted us to offer support.   Who does that - Four Points Sheraton does. They have found rooms to support our entire team keeping in mind the budget problems our California schools are having.  We cannot thank you enough.  We are looking forward to our stay and all other stays for competitions in the area.  Sincerely, Team Mom - UCSB Dive Team;5
Four nights here before flying home to Australia.  It was comfortable, clean, with excellent amenities.  It's very close to LAX and all of the rental car drop off locations.  On site parking was expensive, but we were able to park just down the road at no cost.  On street parking is available just down the road around the vacant block along Airport Boulevard, W 93rd Street and Belford Avenue.  Their lounge area is large with comfortable chairs and a couple of big screen TVs on the walls at either end of the room.  Our room was quiet despite being a short distance from the elevators.  Front desk staff were very helpful.;4
I stayed one night and this room served its purpose of providing a clean, comfortable place to lay my head.  I was very surprised that there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room.  The bathroom was basic and could definitely use updating, however it was clean.  The bed was extremely comfortable and no bed bugs -- I checked after reading another review!  *lol*  The staff was above average...super friendly! I had breakfast in the restaurant and was pleased with the taste and service although it was a bit pricey ($23 +tip for just me!)  Overall this was a solid 3-3.5 star hotel and I'd probably stay again if I needed to but it just wasn't anything memorable.;3
Hotel is very close to LAX and very reasonable rates if you are looking for a Starwood brand with complimentary shuttle service to/from LAX.  This Four Points property has a restaurant and open bar but you will not get 24 hours room service.  Hotel staff is pleasant and facilities and rooms are clean.;4
On our way home to england from Hawaii we were spending the night in LA so we booked a local airport hotel whilst waiting for our bags.  A great price directly through the website & a free shuttle bus ride to the hotel from the airport.  I think I waited about 1 minute before being checked in at reception.  The staff were very friendly & could see we just wanted to get to our room & relax.  Once we had settled in our room, I ordered room service and about 15minutes later there was a knock on our door, with hitting the spot food & drinks.  The bed & pillows were fantastic, wish I could have taken them with me!!  The bathroom was a bit out dated but in the grand scheme of things, not a big deal.  Would def use this hotel again!!;4
The service was okay. The front desk was not inviting as well as the night front desk I felt their conversation was more important than me. When asked for a toothbrush. The front desk agent said she would send it up to the room, after a couple of hours I asked again,  for a toothbrush and she replied again ill send it up. The next morning I called and asked where the toothbrush was. And then they said it will be sent up. 15 min prior to check out. The house keeping staff asked if everyrhing was ok? Told her what happened, with in less than 3 min she came back with toothbrushes and toothpaste. The guest services agent who held our luggage was extremely nice. And because of him and thw housekeeper. I would come back. As for recommendations I would not make this my first choice.;3
We stayed at this hotel for one night and we had no complaints. Our room was somewhat dated, but everything was provided. It is one of the few hotels which offer rooms with two queen size beds. A plus when you are a family of three. There is valet parking and self parking available. Self parking is for a fee. I don't remember how much it was, but it was not cheep. We used the hotel-airport shuttle which was very convenient, as it is available around the clock. We will use this hotel again.;4
Comfortable hotel located minutes from LAX terminal with regular shuttles running 24/7. I arrived at 1am and had no wait for a shuttle and check-in took less than a minute so within 30 minutes of landing I was in my room.  The room included a small fridge and a microwave along with standard furnishings.  I experienced no aircraft noise.  The breakfast buffet was not bad but way overpriced at about $30.;4
We only stopped overnight because we had no choice. Good, clean, spacious hotel. Busy place yet the staff remained pleasant, helpful and efficient. Nice room. Breakfast was the usual and should have been included in the price as in most hotels. Great shuttle service to/from the airport.;4
Excellent in all aspects.  Very friendly staff, outstanding room and convenient to LAX for my early morning flight.  The bar had comfortable seating and a good selection of food and beverages from which to choose.  Highly recommend it for anyone looking for an outstanding airport hotel.;5
This was a very nice hotel to stay in.  My view of the runway was simply amazing.  Friendly staff and very attentive to yor needs.  I would stay here again at this hotel.  The food was good and the resturant service was quick and on par with a Sheraton.;5
We had a red-eye out of LA having arrived a day earlier so we needed a place to stay between 4pm and somewhere around 8pm the next day.  We didn't want to pay for two nights at a hotel and  found a great deal offered by the Four Points LAX---a 24 hour rate!  If you go on their site, they offer a 24 hour rate, but you have to request this at least 48 hours before you arrive and it is not always guaranteed. Received a yes on our request within 8 hours and when we got there, the helpful gentleman at the desk let us stay over the 24 hour limit so we didn't have to spend another 4 hours at the airport!  The rooms are great, WiFi is free and there is a really nice bar on premise. As with many LAX hotels, there is a free shuttle that comes every 15-20 minutes. With the 24 hour offer;5
We stayed here for one night prior to our early morning flight the next day.  The rooms are a good size and probably the cleanest room we have had in a long time.  The bathroom was spotless.  The pool was nice and their were good dining options within the hotel.  The only negative was the windows in the room.  They did not block as much noise as we would have hoped and they tended to vibrate a fair bit.  This is not too much of a problem for one night, but would probably wear thin for a longer stay.  Would definately stay again.;4
This hotel is centraly located in the LAX Airport area, the satff is outstanding, the Lobby is very nice and very functionable, Nice restaurant and Bar. This will be a great overnight stay only. there are several drwa backs.  1) Parking is very expensive considering they are not in the Heart of the larger Hotels of LAX 2) Romms very small almost the size of an extennded stay Hotel 3) very tiny 4) toilet is placed in between 3 walls and it gives you no room at all. 5) House keeping is not concious of your do not disturb sign There are better hotels in the area although the price is normally lower at this Hotel, but if space is not your concern this will be the place for you;2
I would not want to stay in this hotel for an extended period, but it seemed fine on our second visit for what we needed--an overnight facility near LAX airport.  The floor on which we stayed had no ice machine, despite signage, and only a soda vending machine instead of candy, snacks, etc.  The room was clean and adequate but the level seemed somewhat lower than when we last stayed several years ago.  The price had not come down, though.  Bed was comfortable and bathroom had good water pressure.  Shuttle was convenient and prompt.  For the price we paid, an early morning (6 AM) continental breakfast would have been nice, but there was none included in the price.;4
A good place to stay if leaving out of lax.  Free water, free Internet and expensive parking.  Service okay, quick check in and check out.  Free breakfast would be nice and more reasonable priced parking;4
The airport shuttle was reliable and the drivers are helpful with the bags. There was only one choice of restaurant for a late check-in. The food was in typical American portions and the drinks were priced reasonably. The check-in experience was pleasant and efficient despite the queues. The junior suite had all the expected amenities. The TV near the bed could have been better positioned. The welcome fruit and cookies were most welcome. Internet service was fast and reliable. The waiter at the breakfast place was very friendly. There are good ala-carte choices for those avoiding the breakfast buffet.;4
Really nice comfortable modern room (thanks Phil), excellent location for airport with Free shuttle every 20 minutes (free printing for boarding pass). Lifts a little slow. Friendly staff in Brewsters (Victor and Justin), nice food - Mile High Pastrami Club!. El Segundo Blue House Citra Pale Ale went down a treat! Beds modern and comfortable. Could be noisy at night with the aeroplanes.  They even sorted out a disabled access room at very short notice for another traveller on our tour as the booking agent didn't pass the information on. We had room 402 and were sure we could see the Hollywood sign in the distance from the window!;5
I loved this location to LAX.  It is very convenient and easy to get to.  The staff was very friendly, the rooms are clean.  But ... if you're rooming with a friend, it's difficult to get ready in the morning, as the toilet and shower are in the same room as the sink, so both friends can't get ready at the same time.  Only one person can get ready at a time.  I also didn't like that we had to pay $19 per day for parking.  The hotel seemed very nice, but we weren't there long enough to enjoy all the facilities.  (Pool, but no hot-tub.);4
"This place is a dump and the front desk is incompetent to say the least.  1. Landed in LA from Hawaii at 11pm. Checked in at 11:45pm. A impersonal front desk girl assisted with the check in process, no ""hi, welcome to four points"" or anything. She was monotoned and without a flick of facial expression.  2. Reservation on Starwood website showed deluxe room with two queen beds. I specifically verified with that front desk robot and she confirmed with a yes. Given a keycard to room 532. When we got there, it was a traditional room with two double beds, which is their old building. By that time, we were too tired to request for room change... 3. During the check in process. Request for checking out at 2pm. Front desk root said ok, the next morning housekeeping banged on the door at";1
We stayed at the Four Points LAX the night before our Europe flight.  I booked the hotel night and 17 days of parking thru a third party website.  It was our first time staying at this hotel.  It was fantastic value for the money.  The free shuttle to the airport was timely both to and from.  The hotel is old but in good condition.  Staff is friendly.  Free wifi.  The restaraunt has the most extensive imported beer list I have ever seen in one place and the food was good there too.  This will be where we will be staying everytime we fly out of LAX.  Very happy with the hotel and the long term parking program.;5
After a mix up with our flight home to Sydney we booked into this hotel at 23.00 and were meet by very nice helpful staff.The room set up is a bit unusual however was very clean.  When we got to our room we were able to order a nice deli sandwich and plate of fruit from room service, which was delivered very promptly. Breakfast was extra but well worth it. Best of all there is a free shuttle to and from the airport. Will stay here again.;4
The hotel was good, breakfast good too only stayed one night but we were let down by a few members of staff. One of our travel bags was left in London but as promised the airline delivered it to this hotel, unfortunately the hotel denied having any knowledge of it being delivered even showed us the store cupboard where luggage  was kept, and delivery signing book. After 2 agonizing hours of ringing London, Lax and delivery firm we finally demanded to see Duty Manager he took us to another storeroom where there were many cases and bags and ours was among them. So sorry we were let down badly and will never stay there again.;4
We checked in to Four Points because of its proximity to LAX.  The hotel caters for travellers awaiting flights, and in our experience does this very well.  We found our room very clean and very quiet.  But the highlight for us was the flexibility it offered, and its obliging staff. We were offered a late checkout because of our late-night flight, and the hotel offered to hold our bags if we wanted to go off and do anything for the afternoon.  The concierge pointed us to the trolley bus to Manhattan Beach, where we spent a relaxing afternoon and dinner, before returning to collect our bags and use the courtesy shuttle to LAX.  The whole experience was a pleasant surprise, and we could not have been happier with a pleasant last day in LA, at the end of a fabulous US vacation.;5
I recently stayed here twice, within a short time period. Once before leaving on a trip to Hawaii and again on the return.  On the first stay we were given a room on the back of the building facing the parking lot. The room was nice, clean, but a little worn. My only complaint was it was on the sixth floor and about 5am a truck came to empty the dumpsters. It was very noisy, I went back to sleep as I had a 11am flight. It was not a huge complaint. I met some family and ate at the pub in the hotel. It is open late. The food was good. The staff is really great. Checkout was a breeze and there was only a short wait for the shuttle. On the return, I arrived at the hotel at 7am after a red eye flight from Honolulu. I expected to have to drop off my bags and kill some time until rooms;5
The hotel is an airport hotel and according to management i spoke to, most guests check in between 23:00 and 02:00. But there's NO food and NO room service available after 23:00 (except for a couple of small items on a very poor and limited late night menu) so there's no where to get food at the hotel when you arrive.   Also, guests who have midnight (and later) flights can only stay at in their room until 18:00 (if they pay an extra US$40). To stay longer than 18:00, guests must purchase another complete night (crazy!!!). Because of this, the entire lounge area looks like a refugee camp after 18:00 because guests rightly don't want to pay for another full night so they checkout and sleep in the lounge area until their flight. I don't understand why the hotel doesn't offer any;2
I stayed at this hotel because I wanted to spend my last day in LA close to the airport. I spent this day by the swimming pool and enjoyed the last sunny days. The hotel looked a bit old but the room was OK, and the bed was so comfortable, I couldn't forget it :) I didn't experience the breakfast or lunch but I saw people sitting in the bar downstairs watching sports. It is good that it also has a gym. The only disadvantage is the high parking fee/ 20$ per day. And regarding check-in/check-out's, although they say that they offer flexible check in/check out options, they just let me check out at 2pm when I asked for checking out at 4pm because of my flight time. It was disappointing a little.  Of course this hotel shouldn't be chosen for the city tour, it is only convenient for;3
The hotel was clean and the restaurant food was more than decent (great burger!).  The front  staff was very accommodating.  They had trouble locating my reservation even though I made it through their corporate reservations while standing at the front desk!  But the poor front desk person did everything she could to make it up to me while I waited including a free breakfast, parking and hor d'oeuvres.  Once I got in the room it was very nice and close to LAX which was very convenient.;3
Great location! Four Points by Sheraton LAX is right next to LAX. The room is clean and spacious, but nothing fancy. Service was not bad, but nothing special, either. If you are looking for a basic hotel room with a flat screen TV, clean bathroom and comfortable bed, then this hotel is a good choice. But, beware of the parking fees: you have to park at the parking structure across the small street from the hotel. It seems that the parking service is run by a separate company. Their space is tiny and crowded most of the time.;4
"We have two small kids and had an early flight, thought this might make things better.  Cons-tiny spots and not that many- we have a new explorer and I cringed to park my car that close to another car. Outside parking Not friendly staff-at 10:00 pm they sent us on a wild goose chase for our room with the wrong key-with two screaming kids we made a scene Stupid parking validation system - paid in advance and still had to argue with teller to get out without repaying And most of all ""on demand"" shuttle is crap. This was the reason I picked this hotel-I hate the wait for shuttles. We waited 45 minutes at 10:00 pm for a shuttle to finally pick us up. I am a reasonable person and understand the dilemmas that pop up but this was ridiculous. For the price book somewhere else. Hilton,";3
the front desk doesnt seem to care about you they speed check you in and give you your room.   rooms are fair/decent nothing fancy. there's a fridge in the room and a free water bottle.   very convenient location near the airport;3
good value in the price of the rooms, for the area, but they hit you in the pocket in the bar and resteraunt, lobby service is not bad if your lucky not get behind a large group, it is small and only has a few staff, the staff are courtious and freindly, the resteraunt is good the service is not bad, the rooms are clean make sure you get what you book though i booked a king and ended up with a double too much trouble to go down 7 floors to change.;3
We don't liked the central cooling system. We booked two rooms. One room was very cold while the other not. When we asked how to operate the thermostat, they told every room has the same temperature but it was not true, it was visible on the thermostat that one room had 69 and the other had 72.  The other thing we don't liked was that the room had window only to the corridor. ????? It was feel like a prison for me. The corridor to the elevator was dirty.  Other things was OK, I used the free airport shuttle. Maybe the next time I will return there but not for pleasure.;3
"To review it in a sentence: ""Get's the job done"".   Stayed twice on Sept 2011 (2 nights) and Sept 2012 (2 nights), will be staying again whenever I need to stay near the LAX airport.   Plus points: 1. FOC Shuttle Bus > Hotel > Airport. 2. Clean! 3. Spacious! 4. Free WIFI! 5. Cabs are just outside near the main road. Convenient.  Things to take note of: 1. Not near much eatery (to be expected - since it's near the airport). In-N-Out burger is a 10min walk away! Burn them calories before eating the 4x4! 2. Don't take the taxi's flagged from the hotel! They'll fix you into a limo! Unless you want to sit in one. 3. Am a SPG member - Got the SPG lovin'.";5
We stayed two nights about 10 days apart.   The first stay was great, without any problems at all.  The Starwood preferred rooms are nicer than the regular rooms (last yr. we stayed twice and had a regular room so I know).  On our last stay the room had dust clearly visible on the dresser behind the telly and it was obvious that only the front areas of it had been cleaned.  The shuttle was slow and when we called from the airport to ask about it the person answering the phone assumed we didn't have a reservation and quoted us a price of $30 less than our reserved rate and when we checked in that rate wasn't available.  Still it's close to the airport and clean enough. The staff is super helpful and friendly.  Overall it just seems to lack the quality I  normally associate with;4
Everything about our stay was wonderful! We had just gotten off a very long flight from Australia and were exhausted. From the pick-up at the airport, the staff at the front desk, the very comfortable bed, the clean pool, the comfortable bar and the surprisingly good food from room service, we were treated the way paying customers should be, with professionalism and care. We will definitely use this as our recuperating hotel on our next trip to Australia.;5
We wanted a hotel near LAX at the end of our USA trip and it worked out just right.  Our car hire return was only two blocks away and we loved the screen in the lobby showing exactly where the free airport shuttles were at any minute of the day. We printed our boarding cards for free on a dedicated computer. Fantastic.  Check in was immediate and any subsequent contact with reception was friendly and efficient. The same can be said for the concierge desk where we booked a tour of LA and asked for information on local bus travelling.  After a week's camping in the canyons the beds were an absolute dream. The housekeeping and general cleanliness is excellent.  Food in the hotel is reasonably priced and of course the American portions are enormous.  I left wondering how such a big;5
Very large and very modern hotel. Loved the rooms, the large TV's, concierge was great and very helpful. Great location right beside the airport and beside all the car rental return stations which suited very well. Would stay here again in a heart beat.;5
For a quick overnight stay, this hotel offers a high quality service to a traveling passenger.  The check-in was one of the quickest I have ever experienced.  I was grateful since we had just arrived from a  long international flight.  We reserved just a standard room, but it was comfortable, and very adequate for a one night stay.  There was a wide range of paid channels for entertainment, even though we just wanted the cushy bed to sleep.  The buffet breakfast was fine, just a little pricey at $21.00, I thought.   We did appreciate that they had a business center where we printed our boarding pass for free.  That saved us time and trouble. We needed nothing else.;5
Came at an unfortunate time of year where most of the hotels were booked near universal studios. Called hotels.com and they referred us to the sheraton hotel by lax airport. Gregory, the hotel receptionist greeted us a warm welcome even though it was 2 am and we just wanted to find a 3 day room to rest. There was a lot of confusion with hotel.com so we decided to cancel and asked for our refund. Gregory was very helpful and was kind enough to help us out and even gave us complimentary free parking and we were very satisfied and will be happy to return to the sheraton if we're back in LA.  The rooms were very clean but there was no refrigerators but overall it was a fast process to book our rooms and enjoy our vacation.;4
We stayed at this hotel not expecting much but were blown away by the personal service. It's a busy hotel with a lot of travelers coming and going. Jealessia checked us in and made us feel immediately comfortable& welcome. She got us an early check in & treated us like we were staying at a Bed & Breakfast with her sweet smile and incredible patience. We ate a lot at the Sports Bar, very comfortable & friendly.  We loved it when Patty served us. She made so many recommendations & catered to my son's food needs. What a sweetheart! We were once again blown away but the unexpected service. The rooms were cozy, a tad noisy but to be expected at an Airport hotel.  Loved the free wifi! We will definitely stay here again! Thank you Jealessia & Patty. It's nice to see people who really;4
Stayed here before and after our flights to and from China and it was the perfect hotel for that. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were large and very clean, beds were comfortable and bathrooms were ample. Computers and printers are available in the lobby for printing boarding passes. Free airport shuttle only took minutes and they run 24/7. I’d stay here again.;4
The room had nice beds, but nothing else was very nice (I hate it when the curtains, carpet, furniture, linens, decor are all different colors and styles).  The only window is into a hallway that is clearly an enclosure of some old-school motel walkway- a little creepy.  The hallways are pretty beat up, light fixtures damaged, etc.  This place could definitely use someone with a good eye for small maintenance issues.  For $112 I guess it was okay- I'd have been very unhappy if I had paid more.  The front desk was very nice, and helped me get something printed.;3
What a pleasant surprise!  Everything else in the area this past weekend was around $150 and over $200 plus taxes and fees.  We got a great rate using our AAA card.  This rate was the same for seniors and AARP.  These discount rates were less than those we found online through the travel websites.    There was a long line for check-in, but there was no line whatsoever at checkout.  We requested our receipt to be sent to the room the night before check-out so all we had to do was turn in keys. It is right by the airport and they have a free shuttle to and from LAX.  We didn't pay for parking, just found street parking in the nearby neighborhood.  Be careful of the street signs, because at certain times you can only park for 2 hours.  Best spot if you can find one available is by;4
Front desk clerk was friendly and attentive on check in and even though it was busy, did not feel rushed. Staff always said hello and smiled.  We were only there one night, but really liked the comfort of the beds in the small double queen room. Bathroom was small, but adequate for a one night stay. Shuttle was so convenient for our early AM flight out of LAX. Would use this hotel again if in the area and needing a convenient, quiet, clean place to stay by the airport.;4
We stayed at Four points as our last day in LA before we headed home to Australia.   Best thing about it was the ability to check in then check out 24 hours later.  We checked in about 6pm and then checked out at 6pm the next day ready and refreshed for our flight back to AUstralia at 10pm. It was a bit more expensive but we didnt have to check out early and put our bags in storage (tips tips tips) - we also got to have a shower before the long flight.  WOuld definitely consider doing it again if we were in the same circumstances;4
I have relocated to LA and have been booked at the Four Points By Sheraton LAX for five nights due too no control of where I land due to a third party booking through Priceline, My stay there was unsatisfying and frustrating.  The room numbers ranging in 400 -700 had a disgusting smell, the smell of moldy wet clothes or basement, sort of a mildew sent, although my initial disgust for the bad smell took me by surprise, the appearance was nice and fresh soft greens and and yellows with a fresh white bath room area.  Though I notified the manager of that shift and was graciously moved to another room, needless to say there was no resolution, that room also smelled.  Later that night me and my significant other had a beer at Brewsters bar in the lobby which was a pleasant experience;2
"I asked the platinum desk where the business center was and they pointed me to a computer terminal accross the lobby . It didnt work,so she told me to swipe it with my credit card. I did ,it still didnt work.I asked to speak to the Manager on duty.  The manager yelled accross the lobby to me ""What can I help you with?"" I was so stunned that he yelled at me that when I told him the computer didnt work ,I added facetiously,not to put himself out. So ,he went back into his office.  I have stayed at this hotel 6 times this year and its awful ,stay at the Sheraton.";1
Was in town 2 nights and stayed here due to its proximity to my business.  Was greeted by a friendly staff, and the room was well appointed.  My favorite was the Bar/Restaurant near the lobby which had the largest selection of Beers from around the world, many of which I had never sampled, but did so on this trip.  Hats off to the 4points LAX, see you guys on my next trip to LA !;5
"The lobby was very nice.  There is a small swimming pool with no jacuzzi, and two restaurants (one ""nice"" restaurant and one for burgers and beer).  I ordered room service and the food was very good and hot, and the service was quite quick (under 30 minutes).  My room was clean but generic and a little dated, but I felt I got what I paid for.  The price was less than a hundred dollars, and that included wi-fi.  It was a great place to sleep for a few hours before catching an early morning flight, and I was glad I didn't spend more.";4
Hosted my guest from NC stay at the hotel so that she could catch an early flight back home. We enjoyed the atmosphere (especially the 10 on tap beers in Brewsters/100 beers on the menu.)  The front desk was especially helpful and the bar staff was warm and friendly.  Dog friendly too.  Room was clean, beds comfortable - shuttle ran every 20 minutes in the morning. Good choice - will use them again.;5
I am always impressed with friendly staff, amzing bedding, quiet rooms ...too many times I have stayed at  hotels near LAX noisey, from thin walls to sounds of Jets. I have stayed ther 3 times this summer great sleeps!  The best thing is the bar restaurant Brewsters stays open till 1:30 am,  so if you get in late there is still time for a delicious meal  from a variety of great Items on the menu. (no need to run out to fast food at 11pm.  Close to LAX  shuttle service.  never a line at check in or check out. Pool side bar for cocktails and ordering food.  the Best feature is Brewsters   a Connoisseur  Craft Beer lovers delight!! amazing Local craft Beers as well as Beers from around the world, Chimay, Sparten, numerous IPA and pale ales to mention. I love this Hotel!!  xxoox;5
I stayed 2 nights here because my plumbing was being worked on in my apartment and I had to leave due to no facilities. I had almost no problem with anything at this hotel, it was clean, cool, had a friendly staff and it is a no smoking hotel, which I liked. My only gripe is that for a non-smoking hotel, they do allow smoking in the outdoor pool area, which I think is horrible considering there kids in the pool breathing in the second hand smoke. Other than that I found this hotel to be a great place to stay for the price I paid.;4
"This place is not terrible, just disappointing. My room was humid and overly warm when I arrived; there was an elderly air-conditioning unit in the room that didn't work, and when I called the front desk they said the thermostat was controlled centrally for my wing of the building. No luck there; slept with the window open to cool things down, which let quite a lot of noise in. The jungle metaphor continued with the arrival of a cockroach in my room, at least a small one that had the kindness to stay out of sight. Apart from that, it felt largely like a standard business hotel, and very close to LAX. Cheaper than most and you can feel the difference.";2
We stayed at the Four Points LAX while traveling through and back from our final destination point.  The 24 hour check in check out is fantastic. No more waiting for room until 3 pm when you get in early or when you arrive late and have a flight out late the next day having to check out by 11 in the morning. This feature allowed us to freshen up late at night before we got on destination flight and check in early in the morning upon our return.  The prices are very competitive for LAX. Look for some of the specials. We took advantage of the Manhattan beach trolley ride, breakfast and a couple of brews. The second time through we were tired and spent a sunny day at the pool. Good service, friendly staff. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The only thing that would be nice would be;4
Best airport hotel I've ever been to based on one thing... Their 24 hour room rate. Basically if you book any rate over $119 direct thru their hotel website they allow you to check in at the time you wish and check out exactly 24 hours later!! We were in LA for a 24 stop before heading home after a 30 day trip around the USA and being able to keep the room right until our flight left that night was amazing.  We checked in at 9pm the night before, woke up, had breakfast and then caught a $1 bus that stops in front of the hotel that in 30mins had us directly at Santa Monica where we spent the day browsing. We then took the bus back and had the ability to shower and rest before our 10pm flight!!   Rooms are clean and comfortable, nothing special, but just what you need from an;4
Noise can be a major issue if you get a room facing runways and Airport Bld. like the one I got. If you are lucky enough to be in a room not facing planes and traffic then the paper thin walls will let you hear everything that happens in the surrounding rooms though not interconnecting. And when I write everything I mean it ! So the use of ear plugs is mandatory. However, room was functional, well maintained, clean and comfortable. Check-in and check-out were done quickly and politely and shuttle pick up and drop off were satisfactory.;3
During my experience at this property I saw that some outstanding staff went above and beyond the call of duty to make the stay of their guests more amenable - at the LAX property, in particular, Fabiola Lopez at the Brewery, who is very attentive, accommodating, and an otherwise outstanding server - you don't encounter them often, especially in Los Angeles. She was able to provide her excellent and tailored service in both English and Spanish flawlessly.;5
"Would give them a 5 star for customer service.  Found an online rate at the hotel website for $79 just perfect for our 6 hour stay while waiting for a flight from LAX.  When I went to book it, however, the site kept ""refusing"" to complete the transaction.  Called the hotel directly and a charming agent took 10 minutes, called me back and told me that the reason I had the struggle was that they were changing their rates at the exact moment I tried to book -- but she had found me a $75 rate -- was that OK?  Oh yeah, more than OK.  The agent at the front desk -- Alexa?  who greeted our tired selves at midnight made a friend forever when she gave my husband a beer voucher upon arrival.    The room was QUIET which was all we needed.  But man, the bathroom was tired (rust in the";3
The location of the hotel is a short drive away from the airport. There is a shuttle that serves the Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel and this hotel. It is complimentary and runs every 20 minutes.  When I arrived at check-in I gave all my details over and the front desk agent couldn't find my booking. I pulled out my confirmation however to my shock, I actually hadn't completed the reservation. The lovely lady at the front desk went to check about rooms for me and she came back and told me they could honour my rate I booked as they still had rooms available. I wish I got her name but it was on the night of 25 September 2012 at about 845pm when I checked in. She was so lovely and understanding. I could just imagine other hotels charging full rate. This set the tone for the rest;5
This was our third stay at Four Points by Sheraton - LAX.  Stayed the night before our early morning flight.  We didn't have to pay for airport parking while we were away. Much easier to take the hotel's shuttle directly to our terminal.  The service is personal.  Jealessia at the Starwood guest counter, made sure that our every need was met.  She remembered us from our previous visit 6 weeks prior. She was sincere in wanting us to enjoy our stay. Our room was quiet and the bed comfortable.  We were busy and tired, so we ate both dinner and breakfast at the hotel's restaurant.  Nice service by everyone. We like the free WiFi provided in the guest rooms.  The is an excellent park, stay and fly hotel, with outstanding guest services.;5
I'm a local, haven't stayed at the hotel yet, though considering it.  This review is actually for the fantastic bar they have in the bar (Brewster's).  This is a wonderful little spot, HD TVs, amazing beer selection, and friendly, knowledgeable staff.  If you go in on the weekends, Chris and Fabiola are super friendly and know their beers.  The bottled selection is astounding and there's a constantly changing lineup of draught beers.  This is quickly becoming my favorite bar/restaurant in LA.  The only downside is that I wish they would get the NFL package!  The staff is so great, the beer selection so incredible, and the food of such high quality, that I would love to just hang out here every Sunday and watch the best NFL games.  Lots of travelers coming through, wanting to;5
Nice value by LAX but the rooms are a bit dated and internet kept disconnecting. The have a great Beer Lounge. I stayed during the week and seems a large number of flight crews use this hotel. Parking is an uncovered lot and the area is not the best but seems safe for parking.;4
Good location for short trips if flying through LAX.  Room was clean. Bed was comfortable. Staff was friendly. Juan, the guy that checked us was great! The drinks in the bar downstairs were great.  The food was average.;4
I stay here often when I am in between flights and need to rest for an evening before catching a flight in the morning.  The staff is excellent and helpful.  The rooms are clean and quiet.  It is just a few minutes from the airport by free shuttle.  Overall just a pleasant experience and I highly recommend it for a place to relax if you have a long layover of a day or two.;4
Great hotel if you need to stay near LAX.  We rented a car from Budget, which is just across the street - very convenient.  Room and hotel was clean, staff friendly.  The airport shuttle was convenient.  Our room didn't have a window to the outside...the window in the room faced the inside corridor, so if you want natural light, you should make sure you don't get one of these rooms.;4
I was on a coach trip and this hotel had been pre-booked so it was not my choice.  At first I was apprehensive about staying so far out of town but as it turned out it was fine.  The hotel itself is nice, clean and reasonably quiet.  The room had a strange set-up with a huge window out on to the corridor so that if you forgot to pull your blinds down everyone walking to their room could look right in at you getting changed!  I think this was so that the internal rooms don't have an external window, possibly to do with noise from the planes. The restaurant was nice, staff helpful and pretty good food.  The location is great for heading to the airport but too far out for visiting the city.  However we did venture in to the city on the local bus which took about 45 minutes and only;4
Not luxurious and far from tourist attractions but perfect for a layover stop. Room is of good size, well appointed and has free WiFi. Bed is large and comfortable. Bed sheet was a bit too small for the bed but it really doesn't matter. Free shuttle bus is available to & from the airport but make sure you catch the correct one (there is another Sheraton Hotel nearby).Catch No 3 blue bus from just outside the hotel to Santa Monica Beach for $1.;4
This is a great location if you are flying out of LAX and need a spot close to the airport.  The Brewsters restaurant bar is excellent if you are a beer drinker.  The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable.  Decent experience.;4
We were traveling out of the country and needed to park our car.  The park and fly package was a great deal. The check in process was seamless. The lobby was crowded and busy but the front desk staff did a great job to get us checked in quickly.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The shuttle service to the terminal was efficient.  Finally when we returned ten days later the parking ticket functioned perfectly. There are even some covered spots in the parking lot.  Overall a great experience to start and finish our trip!;5
I am pleased to give accolades to the wonderful staff and the Four Points By Sheraton LAX!  My church group held a reunion concert, banquet and vendor show over the Memorial Day weekend 2012, and we were treated like extremely well. The accommodations were top notch, the food was wonderful, and the staff was amazing!  I'd like to personally thank Eden S. in Sales, Johnny in Banquet and Patty, server.  I would strongly recommend this hotel for your next event.;5
Stayed here three times. This last visit was disappointing. The lobby is a madhouse, front desk understaffed and you sense no one is in charge. There's no business center, only pay-per-use lobby computers with a wait line. Rooms are fine, TV and AC work and the bathroom is standard Four Points fare/fixtures. It's airport-close, so that's a plus. In my experience the room key only works one night...they mistakenly program it, forcing you to run back downstairs and present ID. Decent value compared with nearby properties.;3
The staff were very welcoming and efficient. I had to make an alteration to my booking and they patiently took me through the process in a quick and easy manner. Great stay, close to the Mall if you want to catch the bus or taxi.;5
I normally stay at other types of hotels but this time i splashed out and was disappointed. My room was not clean and still had trash from the last occupant. There was no room service menu in the room so I requested one. I also requested a comb as at the time i thought I had left mine. To this day i am still waiting for them to bring me a comb! The shower head was also broken. I saw the room service menu and thought I would go downstairs to look at the bar and restaurant to then decide what i was going to eat. What a waste of time all 3 practically have the same menu!;3
We stayed at Four Points on 10/11 August 2012. Hotel is a short ride from the airport. I was really sick when I arrived and the lovely man at reception (name starts with M, I forget the rest) took one look at me and ordered complementary chicken soup and tea for my room. He then called to check on me and was an absolute star the whole time. The hotel is older in style and therefore rooms aren't completely sound proof and aircon is a little noisy. But I spent the whole time in my room and wasn't bothered and the service was so brilliant it makes up for it. Would stay again - it's hard to find this kind of service in a major hotel chain.;4
meat loaf was great at the resturant!! great room 984 Thanks! miss 'celine' the pretty flower from the lounge bar, employees are great! good to rent a car from a reputable company 'Budget' directly across the road and having a hotel shuttle makes a big difference;5
After flying all day becuase of airline jumble it was great to finally get to the hotel 10 p.m.  Many airline people were checking in at the same time and I thought okay this is going to be a wait.  To my utter surprise a gentlemen seemed to appear and asked if he could help.  I was surprised because I did not initially see him and I knew the airline personnel would be taken care of first.  Not so, I was given my room key, thanked for returning, asked if I needed any assistance to my room, did I park my vehicle and told that the restaurant was closed but I could still get food (11 p.m.).  Traveling from East to West on three flights with layovers is no picnic.  I was tired, needed a shower and just needed a good rest.  Food was not a priority.  When I got to the room there was a;5
I'm a regular at the hotel, usually on layovers on my way from Australia to Europe and back. I really want to bring to your attention 4 people that always without fail welcome me with a smile and genuine warmness that is always appreciated after 13 or so hours in the Air.  On the Front desk, Patricia (also reservations) Martin and Juan and Theresa on the concierge desk by the entrance. To be honest I have only had one bad experience with anyone there and i haven't seen her there since NYE (31.12.11) so I assume she has gone.  I name these 4 people as they are the ones that i seem to have the most contact with.  Due to the flight schedules from Australia all flights seem to get in between 7am and 11am and I always request an early check in if possible in my reservation and most;5
Stayed at the tail end of cocaine anonymous conference.  Lots of recovering addicts having meetings in public areas.   Juan at check in could have been nicer.  They get 30 platinum members checking in a day and was made to feel like platinum status is nothing special. I saw a review on SPG website by a platinum guest who was given complementary parking. I rented a car assuming the same would be offered to me as a platinum member. However this is apparently NOT standard procedure and only after speaking to the manager for awhile did he finally consent to comp our parking after I showed him the other review.   The cookies and grapes in the room on first night of stay is a standard platinum amenity. Pool was nice but ran out of pool towels. Asked 3 times over 1 hr period and never;4
I recently stayed in August, 2012 at this hotel for 5 nights, and found it to be extremely comfortable & very well managed.  The staff are a credit to your organisation.  Especially the room cleaners..... they are just fantastic.  I was in room 782, which was newly refurbished and very quiet, which is sooooo important when u arrive very tired after a long international flight.  The pool area is excellent and much better than any other airport I have stayed at recently.  All in all I could not ask for more...............Thank u once again.  I had a great stay.  Millie1800.;4
I chose this hotel as they had a 24 hour stay (at a specific price) - it was ideal for me because I was arriving in the morning, and needed to leave later than night. Most hotels will charge two full days to do this because of the check in/out times. So while it was more expensive, it was very easy and worked out well.   Pros: 1. Nice, clean rooms 2. Bathroom - great size, very new and little extras like mouthwash.  3. Free bottles of water within the room.  4. Very quiet - you couldn't hear the noise outside 5. Does have AC, but it wasn't particularly cold.  6. Bed was very comfortable.  7. Free wifi  8. Shuttle 9. Walking distance to Avis if you need a hire car for part of your stay  The shuttle was probably the easiest part. No need to ring the hotel to get the shuttle to;4
Ended up at this hotel because I had arranged a ParkSlySleep early check-in after an all night flight into LAX from Polynesia.    Ended up not doing the Park part and changing it to a regular room with noon check in and rather than the planned driving to LAX we got flights on an airline that could check through our bags to save the hassle when we arrived at LAX from our home.  Thus on return we stayed at the only Park Fly Sleep hotel I had found with a decent price and didn't bother to change to another place when I changed our reservation.  Shuttle bus from International Terminal at LAX was convenient once we found where to get it.   Quite full and it took a while because it went to a farther away hotel before coming back to the 4 Points Sheraton.  Friendly and efficient staff;3
My special accommodations of an early check-in and late check-out was arranged with no problems.  Hotel staff was friendly and informative.  The hotels location was convenient and getting around was easy.  Overall it was a very pleasant stay.;5
When checking in, I requested a room that my 9 year old son could see the aircraft arriving at the airport. The reply was that I had purchased a budget room and anyway, the hotel was full. We were then directed to our room on the 5th floor that overlooked the airport. I was happy with the room, the view and the comfort of the beds, but if only the staff had used their common sense they could have said we will put you in a room with a view of the planes and simply continued with the booking in process. We had been travelling throughout California for the past 12 days and this was my least favorite hotel based on value and service. I understand that the location is convenient for the airport etc. but there is no need for complacency.;3
I was in transit and needed to book a hotel room.  I initially had tried to stay at the Westin Airport Hotel but it was fully booked.  I ended up staying at the Sheraton Four Points - aonother Starwood property.  I would highly recommend staying somewhere else if you have a choice.  The hotel and rooms were tired, the towels almost non-existent (it was like there was a drought on towels), and the in-suite amenities sorely lacking - soap/shampoo etc... were befitting of a roadside motel.  I would definitely not stay here again.;2
Title says it all.  Not a fancy, frills kind of place but it is clean and reasonably priced.  Free shuttle to LAX.  Room had a fridge, which is nice.  Comfortable bed. Food at the bar was good and, again, the prices were not ridiculous.  Check in and check out were quick and easy.;4
I wish I had your bed instead of the one I have at home.  It was so comfortable that this was the best night of sleep I have had in a long time.  We had a great stay.  Everything was clean and the halls were quiet.;5
we were concerned since the Sheraton located near us in our state was no where we would stay, but we were impressed by the Four Points Sheraton. The room was roomy, very clean and bright as well as quiet. Having the trolley was perfect for us since we had an entire day before departing. Every staff member said hello and smiled as they passed, even if they were not assisting us.;4
Whlie on a recent business trip myself and several colleagues stayed at this location prior to catching an early morning flight, and to a person all were very pleased with the service and the hotel in general.  Rooms were very comfortable and clean (very important when you are on the road constantly).  We all enjoyed the pub/restaurant and the service was five star - we were a large group and the fellow serving us did an amazing job.  I would also mention that check-in staff were very friendly as was the young man who was serving at the pool side bar - very friendly and knowledgeable about LA.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone requiring a stay near LAX, especially if you have to pick-up or drop-off a rental.  We were impressed enough to recommend to our events planner to;5
We booked this hotel because we had an early flight out of LAX the next day, and the cost of the park and fly deal was only about $30 more than the economy Lot C parking!  Hotel front staff was super friendly, answered all my questions.  We had a clean, comfortable room, with a refrigerator, huge TV, and, to my young son's delight, a view of planes landing.  Despite the view, it was VERY quiet.  I would definitely stay again, especially if we are using the park and fly deal.  Next time, though, we'll skip work that day, and get down there early to take advantage of the pool--start the vacation early!;5
Twice a year I travel to LA for business and stay at a hotel close to the airport.  The past few stays have been at the Hilton LAX and I was looking for a change.  The first thing that attracted me were the different Government rate packages with one including free parking to another offering a breakfast buffet to another offering a $25 food and beverage credit per day. (my favorite).  Upon check-in, several of my coworkers were with me and the staff greeted us quickly.  My two biggest brags are about the room and the food.  With the room, this puppy was CLEAN.  Everything from the furniture dusted to the light fixtures polished (yes I notice this stuff).  The toilet area was a little tight but I did appreciate the waterflow toilets.  Counter space and lighting was acceptable.;4
I spend an average of 4 nights a week in hotels, so I do have certain expectations. Nothing fancy, I would like a quiet room, that's clean, not a closet and a functioning elevator that gets me there. That said, when at LAX, I typically stay at the Radisson but I felt like trying something different. Let's just say I shouldn't have. It was hard to find the parking area which is located behind the hotel and not exactly easy to find for a first time customer. Once I parked the car, I had to walk back through the whole length of the hotel to the front desk. The receptionist was very friendly, processed my reservation and handed me two room keys. So far so good. The elevator is just around the corner but getting up to the 7th floor was a somewhat scary ride. The elevator felt like it;1
It is at LAX, conveniently located at arcoss the street of Avis car rental. I stayed there for a couple times in June. Good hotel, up to 4P standard. The room is clean, and good size. I enjoyed the pool outside, with nice seating area. I rent cars from Avis, I did not take Avis  shuttle, instead, I checked in the hotel first, spent a night there, then walked to Avis to pick up my car, which saved me a day of rental. There were other car rentals there you just need to check, so it may save you some money by staying in the hotel, picking up the car next day.;3
This had a great location to both the airport and where I had to meet my friends. There was plenty around locally including restaurants, grocery store and shopping for anything that I needed. The last thing I wanted to have to do was deal with traffic on the Freeways.  Even spent one night at Brewsters in the hotel. Incredible selection of beers and good reasonable food as well. Nemo did a nice job at the bar making suggestions from the over hundred beers to ones of my liking.  When checking in, look for Juan - he was exceptionally friendly, and as the first person I met there it really set a good tone for my stay.  Definitely would stay there again.;4
The Four Points Sheraton is near the LA Airport and provides a reliable shuttle service. The room is spacious and clean and the beds are comfortable with quality linens and pillows. It has a restaurant and bar with breakfast many times included with the rooms. The staff is friendly and helpful  and available when needed.  I stayed at this location in order to return my rental car the night before my flight. It made my early flight show a breeze with the shuttle which ran every 15 minutes. It's great to start the day stress-free when traveling.;3
"I was one of many travelers staying overnight to be near LAX for an early morning flight.  I chose this hotel because it was close to the airport, within walking distance of the rental car return, and had a 24-hour airport shuttle.  The good points are (a) the price was reasonable compared to the other hotel chain properties nearby; (b) the staff was pleasant and welcoming, (c) the rooms are adequate and comfortable with free wifi, and (d) the hotel is one of a half dozen that sponsor a single shuttle that runs every 15 minutes or so and on which this was the last stop before the airport.  The hotel restaurant did not look particularly inviting, so I had a light meal in the bar, Brewster's.  This bar boasts 100 or so beers, and has a good selection of wines by the glass.  It is";4
Patty O.is the most fun and customer-oriented service person I've met in years. She rearranged the menu and practically did handstands to make us happy. The food was fine, but the service was the FINEST.  Nice job!  Highly recommended.;4
"I like to stay at airport hotels. I can drop off the rental car and use the shuttle the next morning for the return home. I don't take redeye flights anymore, so I opt for and extra nights stay. It is hard to find a really good, well maintained and attractive airport hotel at a reasonable price. I did not expect much from the hotel. and I was not disappointed. The price is reasonable and the hotel is nice enough.  Let me digress a little. LAX is one of the worst airports in the country; unattractive, congested and spread out. You have to walk four hundred miles from the gate to the bag claim. Once you exit, you have to walk another four hundred miles to the airport shuttle pick up area. This is not a good start for the trip to the hotel.  Once at the hotel I entered a busy";3
After researching the LAX hotels we decided on the Sheraton based on past reviews, closeness to airport, and the rate included a breakfast.  The room was spacious, clean, quiet and the beds were really comfortable.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  Breakfast was amazing, and set us up for the day!!  Only small downside was we had a 25 minute wait for the shuttle at the airport to get to the hotel. We would choose this hotel again to stay at.;5
"very close to Airport, very comfortable room at reasonable rate, and exceptionally helpful staff. We arrived from a VERY long flight from Australia and had requested an early check-in. when we arrived, because all rooms had been booked the night before, Housekeeping had not yet cleared a room for us, and we were told that it would be at least 2 hrs. before we could check in. However, within 30"" the Front Desk had gotten us a room, and we were most pleased with their helpfulness. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the restaurant looked comfortable, menu varied, and prices reasonable. Only negative: we were not carrying a Lap-top and while there were two computers available in the Lobby for guests, the cost, after an initial free 15"", was outrageous. Management has already notified";5
After a really disappointing number of stays at the nearby Westin I decided to take my Starwood gold card down market to the Four Points Sheraton - just as an experiment. And, guess what, it is better in every respect. The internet is free everywhere and high speed - and it really works for business strength email requirements. The TV's work well (which should be a basic assumption - but after the Westin LAX take nothing for granted) - the staff are friendly and it is possible to walk across the road to both Budget and Avis. The only point of criticism would be that some of the food in Brewsters bar needs to be improved - I had a quesadilla that was really just (too much) cheap cheese and chicken. My room was well serviced - and this hotel is a credit to the Starwood brand.;5
Airport hotels in general are not the best places to stay, they are built primarily to be convenient, functional, and need to accomodate a high turnover rate.  The Four Points clearly falls into that category.  Located between the Marriott and the Renaissance, it is normally the most cost effective option of the main chains that ring around LAX.  However do be careful about extra charges such as parking.  There are 3 main towers.  My advice is to avoid the central one.  The rooms are smaller and the only window opens out to an aisle.  For a single night or a few hours it might not matter, but not all rooms are created equal here.  I didn't eat here so can't review the restuarant however in general the hotel was a little tired and run down, albiet rather clean.  Only issue I had;3
Not originally planning on staying at an hotel but my wife and our toddler needed a place to stay on our last night in LA.  Because it was short notice and a Sunday morning, there were no rooms available for early check-in...all rooms were booked the night before.  However, the staff did a great job getting us in a room by 11:00am.  The bed was very comfy and the service at the restaurant was outstanding.  The shuttle from this hotel goes directly to LAX which took about 5 minutes for our early morning flight to Hawaii.  It is also very close to the rental car companies, Budget is directly across the street and Hertz was about a block away...very convenient for those who don't like to spend a lot of time on shuttle buses.  The only minus would be staffing, probably a person more;4
Stayed 3 nights at this hotel and was very pleased. My only complaint is the 19.00 per day parking feel. I think it should be included. Also no complimentary breakfast. They do have a beautiful heated pool but It's outdoors, therefore, at night when it was chilly you were cold when you got out.;3
Cashed in some SPG points (easily my favorite of all hotel rewards programs, and I use them all) for a night here before an early flight at LAX.   There's not a lot NEAR the hotel, but the hotel itself is very comfortable and spacious. Was upgraded complimentary to a junior suite, with a trey of cookies and personalized welcome note on the desk (nice touch). Every staff member I encountered went out of their way to make me feel welcome. I live 3/4 of the year in hotels because of business, and this is one of the most genuinely welcoming staffs I've come across.  Only complaint would be that the mattress sagged a bit on the left side, but its the one glitch in an otherwise great hotel experience. Will definitely return next time I'm needing an overnight near LAX.;4
My 18 year old son and I stayed here on August 5, 2012 before leaving for our vacation to Cancun.  We had an early morning flight on Monday and I was trying to figure out how to get to the airport at 4:00 a.m. and where in the world to park?  I looked at several options and shuttles because I couldn't bring myself to ask anyone to take us to LAX on a Monday at such an early hour.  I was getting discouraged because of the expense and all the hoops I felt I needed to jump through.  One of my co-workers suggested that I call the Four Points Sheraton and ask about their park and stay deal.  Wow!  I am so glad that I did.  I couldn't believe my good fortune.  We were able to drive up Sunday night, get an amazingly comfortable room (the beds are to die for), park our car all week and;5
I have been staying at the Four Points LAX several times a year for several years.  The entire staff – be it the restaurant, front desk, guest services, valet, etc… - they always have been extremely courteous and helpful.  The hotel has been renovated in phases over the past few years and looks completely refreshed with nice rooms and a new restaurant.  The lobby area is great as well as the pool and workout facility.  Four Points LAX is very good location for access to the 405 or 105 as well as Lincoln Blvd.  Dinner in El Segundo or Manhattan Beach is only minutes away.  If you are interested in value and a nice clean place – this property and it's people gets high marks.;5
I travel a bit for work and am thrilled to have stumbled upon this hotel.  I normally stay at another hotel when in Los Angeles.  When sudden change in plans sent me to Los Angeles, my normal hotel was not availalbe.  This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because I found the Four Points.  This hotel is well located, just off the main road, but it has such ambiance.  You are made to feel welcome from the very start.  The staff is friendly and helpful, but not overbearing.  The accommodations could not be better.  Clean, crisp feeling rooms, but some how cozy.  Made one feel like they were living in an upscale apartment.  After dealing with the crowds of people in this busy city, coming back to the hotel in the evening was just what a weary traveler needs...peace and;5
This past weekend I was there for the weekend while I attending an Army Covention. I previously stayed there for a whole week and I must say I will continue to pick that hotel every time the army gives me a choice :) the service is excellent and so is housekeeping :) The airport being so close has not bothered me at all I find this place very cozy! Ohhhhhh and theyre food is amazing...not to mention their drinks!;5
Was there for 2 nights. The place is strategic as it near to the airport. The car rental center just at the opposite of the road. Universal Studio located less than 30 minutes from the hotel and they also offer package and trip to go there. Burger King located just a few minutes walking.;5
The room was nicely appointed, but did not have a refrigerator or microwave.  I bought some cookies for a friend, when I came to the room to remove my belongings and check out, I found out that the housekeeper has already cleaned my room, and helped herself to some of the cookies.  I happen to have a copy of the reciept for the cookies, and the hotel reimbursed me for the cookies, although I had to go to the store to buy more.  The front desk staff and the in-house restaurant were very good both service and food choice and taste.;3
I always choose your property when I visit L.A., I’m totally satisfied every time, front desk service excels.Location of the property is perfect for me, near the airport and car rentals. Why pay more! Guillermo Cepeda;5
Two trips to LA, three months apart including this August  Both times Patty (Patricia) served me at breakfast.  She is the best waitress anywhere I have travelled.  Ready at hand within 60 seconds of being seated- with both juice and coffee for your choice.  Perfect timing taking your order and always just the right mix of friendliness and speedy service, sees you from across the room and understands your signals for everything you need refills in.  If rushing to a meeting and changing from plate to carry-out she'll have your containers there muy pronto or if taking a nice slow meal with coffee and a visit, she matches you pace.   Really awesome!    Thank you Patty!!;5
The location of the airport & they offered park & fly is why I chose to stay here, as well as the reservation desk was easy to work with unlike other hotels in the area.  The shower in our room the first night would not stay as a shower and it took over an hour to figure it out as the maintenance man they sent up said he was going home and another person would come to look at it.  I finally figured out how to make it work as it was already 11:35 p.m.(not happy). We received a different room on our return and no problems with shower.  The rooms are ok for quick overnight.  Not fancy.  The parking was not covered but appeared secure. No problems with our car.;3
We stayed 1 night at Four Points with the sleep/park & fly package, leaving our car at the hotel for the week. Got a really great rate! Front desk allowed us to check in early so we could enjoy the pool. Then found a restuarant for dinner on Supelveda. Comfortable beds, slept well, not always easy before a flight. Even had a drink at Brewsters Bar in the lobby. 180 Brews from around the world. Hubby was very happy about that.Wish they had Ciders on their list though. Settled for a nice white wine. Over all very happy with the service and our stay. Would do it again for the value since we had an early flight out.;5
This hotel is really good, it's just the location. It's nothing bad with the location, it's completely safe, it's just that it's a bit far to attractions. Westfield shopping mall is just outside the door, 3 mins walk. There is one bar that I know of, just left of the entrence to westfield, didn't go to it.;4
"As a Starwood Preferred Guest member and frequent traveler I can say this was by far the worst hotel experience we've ever had.   We stayed here prior to a cruise thinking it would be fine for a night's stay after a long flight; and the Sheraton Gateway was booked. I was under the impression it might not be as fancy as the other Starwood resorts but I'm by no means a princess and felt comfortable booking our pre-cruise stay here.   As a frequent traveler and yes, tad bit of a germ-a-phobe, my husband and I always check the mattress in our room for bed bugs. It's something we have done out of habit for a long time after hearing horror stories about how difficult those things are to get rid of, not to mention how disgusting it is.   I was HORRIFIED when I pulled back the corner of";1
For a 3 night stay in LA this is not the ideal location. There are no nearby bars, restaurants or shops apart from what's in other hotels.  Not wanting to venture out in the area at night meant we ended up staying at the hotel to eat and drink which turned out to be the most expensive 3 days of our 10 night trip.  This hotel is ideally located for an overnight stay near the airport but not for any longer. Virgin holidays need to take a good look at the hotels and locations they are placing holidaymakers in before overcharging customers.;3
I stay at this hotel 1-3 days per week, 2-3 weeks per month.  I've been doing this for 2 years now.  Note that I am a platinum level so I do get faster check-in and always a nice room.  However, the service, amenities and overall quality have only gotten better during this time.  I recommend this hotel to any traveler, business person or vacationer.  Be careful of some reviewers who complain about their one time here - or for that matter at any hotel.  Better to trust the reviewers who have stayed many times.    You won't go wrong here.  Modern, close to airport and reasonable.;5
Had a one night stay at this hotel at the end of July and can only describe this place as average. Check in is 2pm & we arrived at about 2.15 pm after a 12hour flight and was told our room wasn't ready well cheesed off,after a 40 min wait we got a room on the 8th floor walked in stank of smoke went back down then got a room on the 9th floor thankfully this was ok clean but a bit dated,also beware you will be charged $10 per guest per night if there is more than two of you per room;2
The check-in experience was the fastest, most efficient I have had anywhere in the world and I have stayed at some impressive hotels. I have stayed here 3 or 4 times and will continue to do so on LAX trips. The room was modest but had everything I needed and the wifi service was excellent.;4
This is a fairly decent airport hotel. You are not spoiled for options at LAX in terms of hotel accommodations though in my experience a lot of the hotels seem pretty worse for wear. I got a good rate at the Four Points for a one night stay. The hotel is located pretty close to the airport, about half way really between the airport and the freeway. Shuttles are provided to/from the hotel, and you can even jump in on the shuttle provided by Budget rent a car across the street. Wifi is also free which is a pretty big plus!  The registration desk isn't immediately obvious and you have to walk around to behind the elevators to find it. The seating area in front of the registration desk seemed large and comfortable and over looked the pool. Check in was quick, there was a key card;4
Hotel has washing machines and dryers, and conveniently  located near the LAX transit center if you do not want to rent a car. You can schedule tours at the hotel with pick up. The  hotel beds are very comfortable.;4
Very good hotel, conveniently located close to airport (LAX) and freeway to get about major highlights in region Quite important to mention that, despite being near the international airport, it doesnt lead to any disturbing moments, inc. calm night rest :-)  Food is really nice - traditional cuisine, wide menu Staff also looks hospitable and helpful   Well, I've got a nice stay here and positive emotions;5
We used this hotel as a staging area while the rest of the family flew in from around the country.  I was able to use SPG cash & points which is always a plus.  Booked a traditional room, but got upgraded to a deluxe with no problems due to SPG status.  The pool was great (nice and warm even when it got cooler at night) and the room was bright and clean.  A really good stay all around.;4
I stayed one night at this hotel in order to catch a flight back to France. Because I didn't want to hurry, I preferred an airport hotel. I found this four points hotel very good, and certainly up to standards of many Sheraton's or even Westin hotels. Internet (Wifi) was free and although near the airport, the rooms are fairly quiet. A 1.30PM extended check-out was given without any problem. The hotel has one restaurant and a pub/bar where you can have a meal. I had dinner at the pub and found the price/quality ok. (don't expect haute cuisine, portion was huge). Staff was very friendly and I felt very welcome. There is a shuttle bus every 20-25 minutes to the airport which takes approx. 5 minutes.;4
My company sent me there for a 3 day training seminar.  The lobby was spacious and inviting, and the desk staff courteous.  The meeting rooms were well equipped and comfortable. They maintained an appropriate temperature all day, as I KNOW that some of you have been to those meetings where it was just too hot, or you were freezing and couldn't focus. The rooms were clean, well equipped, and quiet. Cons: very pricey for what you get. The carne asada was nothing more than some slices of beef on a bowl of steak fries ($25).;4
My husband and I stayed here for 1 night on route to San Francisco after flying in from Australia. The main reason I booked this property was because of the convenient 24 hour check in/check out. The shuttle service from the terminals was easy and convenient and check in was a smooth process. We booked a deluxe room and tge rate was reasonable and included breakfast. The room itself was standard size and nothing flash but after a long haul flight I didn't care. There was quite a lot of noise from the planes taking off and landing constantly but I guess it's to be expected when staying at an airport hotel.;3
My son and his bride - married for 1 year on July 17th, stayed at your hotel.  They mentioned their upcoming anniversary - you guys are so sweet!!  When they got to their room, a lovely dessert and a complimentary bottle of wine was chilling in a bucket!  Man, what service!  You went the extra 10 miles!!  They totally loved their time together there and you have earned our respect big time!  Northon for Nathaniel and Brook;5
Good hotel, clean rooms, friendly staff, excellent rate. I had an early morning flight and took the shuttle to LAX. Driver was helpful and friendly. I will be staying there again the next time I'm in LA and have a morning flight.;5
I stayed here for two nights on a business trip. I would not stay again. Nothing bad but the rooms seemed dated and not well kept, even in what I was told was the refurbished part of the hotel. The rates are good and if it was just for one night and you didn't have to spend much time in the hotel, it would be okay, but the next time I need to stay near LAX, I will look elsewhere.;3
Good hotel, close to LAX with easy And frequent shuttles, clean rooms and nice outdoor pool area. We used Hotwire to make the booking and felt the rate paid was very good. Nice room service menu and bar in lobby and across the road from a liqour and small grocery store and burger king. With the help of the friendly concierge we paid $40 to get a limo to Santa Monica one afternoon, $5 more than a cab and much more comfortable.;4
We live about 3 hours north of Los Angeles and drive to LAX while we're gone for a week or so on leisure trips, so we have to find a convenient place to park while we're gone.  It's just too grueling for us to drive 3 hours (or more, depending on traffic on the 405) and catch a morning flight.  So, for the past few years, we've stayed overnight at various hotels in the area, so we could park, stay overnight and catch a shuttle the next morning when we're fresh again.    We tried several hotels in the area before we found the Four Points LAX.  It's closer to the airport than most of the others we tried, the rooms are nice, the prices are right for a room with free parking while we're gone and it's really easy to get to.  Since finding this hotel, we don't even bother looking;4
"The LAX 4 Points was a great place to stay for my four-day visit to LA.  The room was nothing fancy, but clean and well-maintained, with decent sound insulation.  I was there for pleasure, but I noticed a lot of business people and airline people were guests also.  The staff were great, especially Adrian at Brewsters, the hotel bar which serves a wide selection of ""craft"" beers.  The pool was a cut above as well.  Overall, I would say it was a strong value at a very convenient location.";5
Love my Starwood properties but this one may have just disappointed me.  Check in was slightly chaotic. Staff was back and forth trying to get people in, but did not seem prepared for rush.  Room was very dated. In serious need of a renovation. Bathroom was also spotty. Shower head needed replacement and front part of bathroom was slightly cramped. A/C was also spotty at night. Either too cold or too hot. No compromise. Would try again if options improved.  Room also needed a good cleaning.;3
This simple but clean hotel is convenient for LAX airport as well for the rent a car companies located next by. One can have a short conferences conveniently located next to the LAX airport as well. The food is simple but appropriate and the rooms have been in a good shape. Also the shuttle busses to and from the LAX airport are running regularly.;4
My family of four usually stays at the  Four Points Sheraton when we are flying out of LAX.  We stay one night and usually eat at the restaurant.  For our needs, the hotel more than serves its purpose.  The rooms are comfortable, the restaurant, though on the expensive side, serves good food and large portions.  We have used the pool and fitness center and have been more than satisfied.  Given that we leave the car there while on our trips, the cost for the room and parking is very reasonable.  The shuttles are also very reliable.;5
My stay at Four Points in L.A. was awesome!! My room was immaculate and the staff was incredibly nice. In passing, I mentioned my recent graduation while checking in. After returning from a day in the city, I was met by a Congratulations card, signed by all the staff and a beautiful dessert tray! I was so blown away, I actually cried - tears of happiness of course! lol! My entire stay was that way. This is a winning hotel - you will definitely enjoy your stay at Four Points Sheraton - L.A.!;5
I would recommend the Sheraton at LAX if you want to be close to the airport. It has been completely renovated and the lobby and rooms are BEAUTIFUL, fresh and clean. They have a shuttle to/from the airport that leaves every 20 minutes. If you rent a car, you can even turn it in early, so you don't have the hassel of returning it before your flight. I had an Avis car and it was a 2 block walk to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.;4
Although our room was always clean, it was never fully serviced. The ONLY way received washcloths was by calling the front desk for them. They were NEVER left in the room by housekeeping.   Additionally, in the hallway it looked as though a pet had vomitted. It was still there when we left. Gross.   Unfortunately we stayed at the same time they were doing a power check (about 30 minutes long) and also testing fire alarms. Although inconvenient, I do understand it needs to happen.;3
Really nice Sheraton hotel with lovely appointed rooms that were modern, spacious and clean. Beautiful pool to lounge at with towels and nice chaise comfy lounges.  The lounge inside served excellent martinis and great food.  Free shuttle to and from LAX that ran frequently. Would definitely make a return trip if I needed to be near the airport.  No airport noise even!;5
This place may well have some nice rooms. The one they stuck me in was more like a self-storage locker, with the only window looking out on the hallway and the outside being though another window on the other side of the hallway outside of which people were traipsing by and peeking in. Small and cramped. Poor reception on TV. Shower didn't work, and when it  barely could be made to work was aimed at the tile wall. Stuffy, even on a 60-degree F LA evening. The fan worked, it kept me awake. But the room was still stuffy. Paper-thin used-up sheets. One bar of soap to SHARE between sink and shower. Hideous food in bar (but great beer selection). Inattentive staff.;1
We stayed here overnight on our way home after 2 years abroad.  The front desk was very nice and helpful, but the lobby is small and it felt chaotic.  The room was very small and the furniture seemed too big for it, with hardly any room to move around.  The bathroom was also small and old.  But it was clean and the bed was great!;2
We were traveling from the east coast to Hawaii and needed to stay overnight near LAX. We decided to stay at the Four Points LAX based on reviews, price and them being in the Starwood network. We stayed June 29th & July 6th, both stays with a late arrival and early departure. The free shuttles ran frequently (approx. 10 minutes) to and from the airport with a slight delay for a stop at the Westin a few blocks away. Check-in was friendly, quick & easy and we were upgraded to a mini-suite probably based on our Gold status. Room was large, clean, quiet and comfortable. No problems whatsoever. We ate breakfast in their dining room. Food was good, service a little slow but OK as they were very busy. Good place to stay for a night between flights.;5
"I was at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX for two weeks in June of 2012.  The rooms were well appointed; nice desk area one of those leather and stainless steel office office chairs, two free bottles of water were left in my room by housekeeping staff every day.  Free WiFi as well, which I found to be fast enough.  I liked the easy access to the airport and the 405; you could be at either within minutes.  Free shuttle service to the airport, and a few other attractions I think.  The staff is friendly, and typically goes out of its way to remember specific guests and their preferences, if they're staying for more than a few nights.  One of the things that sets this hotel aside from a number of the other LAX area airports is it actually has a turn-in loop with the awning thing for";5
"Maybe prejudiced by the timing of my visit which coincided with a large, boisterous religous group. They caused the noisest stay I've ever experienced. Not the hotel's fault, but could mean it caters to large groups, which often does mean a busy lobby, desk and staff. One doesn't stay near an airport for a quiet getaway, so trying to be fair. Room was OK. ""Center tower"" was not pleasant as rooms face out on to roof equipment. If you want refrigerator, they are ""on request"", so speak up.";3
"Location is convenient to airport and car rental facility.  The staff was friendly and helpful, but....  the service needs improvement.  The bathroom had long black hair on the floor and toilet when we checked in.  We needed more towels which we got when we called, but there was also only 1 bar of soap in the room.  There was a water bottle of ""something"" left beside the bed.  The next day when we returned to the room the same hair was in the same places, there was, again, not enough towels.  We had a 6 AM flight the next day but could not sleep until 11:30 when the music in the lounge below us quit playing - it was very loud. (we were on the 2nd floor)   The price was good, but I think we were given the bad room because of the deal we got.  Probably would never stay here again!";2
I have to say that I was a bit skeptical to staying here...not much luck staying by the airport.  But, the staff was exceptional and service was wonderful.  My room was very clean and quiet.  I really enjoyed Victor at Brewster's Bar...he was always friendly and after a long day working, his drinks were cold and delicious...I ordered room service for breakfast and it was always fast and hot and very good.  I appreciate the late check out being my flight did not leave until mid-night.  It's a great place for business trips that last a few days....very close to Manhattan Beach which was nice.  I'll be back for sure!;4
We stayed here for 3 nights during a west coast tour, the hotel is very close to lax airport but as a hotel for exploring L.A. it isn't great as all the areas of interest are around a $100 taxi ride away. the room we were given overlooked the pool and the walls were very thin and you could everything even a suitcase being unzipped, we were also on the end of block near to the vending machines so we were disturbed by these quite frequently. We had the buffet breakfast in the hotel on the first morning however it wasn't great so we made the short trip to the nearby Starbucks the following 2 days ( there are 2 Starbucks close by, one in the Marriott and another one further along the road, the Marriott one strangely was double the price to the other one for the same items). Upon;2
I can truthfully say I have had no bad experiences whilst staying at The Sheraton Four Points at LAX.I have stayed their a number of times coming and going for business down at Marina Del Rey. Happy hour is best in the area,....rooms have been good to excellent (upgrade time),good location to el Rey, only 5 miles away.I have stayed at the back and side and front to of the hotel,..sometimes at very low prices sometimes slightly higher,...I have also been upgraded once,...staff is usually very helpful and friendly,....however if you go on the attack usually about a small mater,...you may find an occasional adverse reaction,....we are all human,...Good Choice of a hotel overall.;4
good hotel,,but check rooms before settling in as cleanliness at times is not upto standards.The restaurant is awesome and the staff very courteous and helpful.car rentals nearby and frequent shuttles to airport.;4
Sorry! I've stayed in many Sheraton based hotels and always liked it - but, this one is worst! Crowded (because its cheap), rooms are bad, not clean. I will never stay again!;2
The pros are that you can check in on a 24 hour time clock. But you have to go thru the hoops of filling in a form when you book. The cons are that there was an old wet dog smell. It was definitely coming from the duvets and blankets. The sheets didn't smell. But I was skeeved out by that rancid blanket smell.;3
"We had a number of things go wrong:  fruit cup from the coffee stand was moldy; was given a free drink voucher because we had problems with check in and had to listen to the bartender rudely, very rudely telling one of the waitstaff that he was wrong re: what could be ordered with the voucher AND he did this in front of us, the customers.  I was extremely uncomfortable.  Our parking ticket didn't work twice.  I went to the desk and was told I had done something incorrectly.  I explained that I was fairly intelligent and handled the parking ticket correctly.  He continued to argue until I started to walk away.  Bill delivered to our room had a charge that wasn't our.  I had to then stand in line to correct.  Effort was made to correct thre errors which was appreciated.  The rooms";4
Room was small, dated and located in back of hotel -  hard to find at first. Thought we were getting free breakfast but found out it was $16/ea because we paid a discount room rate. Location was very good and close to airport. Probably would not stay here again. Targeted more for business traveler than vacationing couple because prices were very high and they would not tell us about close places to eat but steered us to their pricey bar instead.;2
This was a nice hotel and very close to LAX.  They have a shuttle to and from the airport.  But they charge $28 for parking if you bring your car.  They also charge for the internet of around $13 PER DEVICE.  We had three devices and I should have double checked with the front desk.  Something to consider when booking.  The room is nice with great amenities.  And the bed is great.  Breakfast is not included.    I just don't think it's worth the price if you are staying just overnight.  You can get all the extras for free somewhere else.  But if money is not a factor then this is good hotel for you as it's one of the hotels that's closest to the airport.;2
"Convenient for LAX, this hotel has a nice pool and a good bar/pub. It is only a few minutes from terminals at LAX and aircraft pass close to the hotel. If you have your A/C on in the room, however, you probably won't hear the landing planes. Parking is $20 a day; more if you valet. Rooms are good value though and free in-room wi-fi is a bonus.";3
I use the Four Points by Sheraton when picking up family at LAX.  I live 2 hours away which is 3-4 in traffic.  Seems like everyone always comes in or out of LAX at the wrong time for traffic.  I like to stay the night before I pick up early arrivers so the trip is more enjoyable and less rushed.  The bar is great for the evening before!;5
The staff at the hotel was amazing. They went out of their way to help us with some printing we needed. They also found out it was my birthday and went out of their way to make it a very special day for me. The hotel was great and we would definitely recommend it to others. Location was great close to the airport. Thank you Sheraton staff for our stay one to remember.;5
Overall would recommend to spend extra and stay somewhere else.  Room was clean but very outdated.Walls were paper thin. Could here the conversations from the next room and from the corridor.   Walking to room felt like walking through a hospital.   On the upside the food was good and enjoyed the bar area with friendly staff.  Hotel may improve with renovations.;3
I can recognize, that it once was a great hotel. However, things seemed to have changed meanwhile. I had a Jr. Suite for the night and it was quite large but the furniture was outdated, there were hair in the shower (also, there was no shower gel/bath soap available) and the room had an overall rundown/dirty appearance. I was too tired and beat to complain but voiced my discontent with the manager the next morning. She immediately took action and wanted to treat me to a complimentary breakfast and told me to let her know, when I'm staying there next, as she would personally ensure, that my stay would be pleasant etc. I thought that was very nice of her....unfortunately, by then I had already made other plans. Maybe a follow up phone call by a staff member, after the guest has;2
With the package I parked my car at the hotel, took a hotel shuttle to LAX, flew to Seattle, came back on a late flight one week later, took the hotel shuttle to the hotel and had a very restful night's sleep before driving home. If I had taken a shuttle to the airport and back from my home in Anaheim, the return fare alone would have been over $100 due to the late hour. Bed was super comfortable, room was clean and attractive.  Best thing: a good night's sleep before driving home.;5
Stayed here for a night after returning from Beijing and prior to a flight the next day to home.  I found a number of problems with the property.  1.  When I checked in I requested two room keys, but was only given one.   2.The TV did not work, and per the engineering department staffer who came to the room upon my request to check, was told the cable was not at all connected.  He also said this was not something I or a  a prior guest could have caused as guests do not  have access to this equipment.  He was professional and offered to make the connection but as  it was late I didn't have it done at that time and did w/o the TV service.   3. In the morning I noticed the drain in the bath/shower was slow and upon examination found the cause to be hair partially plugging the;2
I stayed here mainly because of a recommendation from my dad. I was wondering before I got to this hotel on why my dad was so proud and eager for me to choose this hotel. So, when I finally arrived in Los Angeles, I immediately went to Four Points LAX and voila, the service crew are very hospitable! The hotel might be simple in design, not so big compared to others but the service that every hotel employee gives you is top notch. I also loved my deluxe suite which was so spacious with two flat screen TVs, BIG storage rooms for my luggage and shopping stuff plus a clean bathroom.   The location too is very accessible to Car Rentals, Fast Foods and the Tour Bus Office that I usually go to everyday as part of my trip.   My overall stay here was so comfortable that I already made it;5
I usually find Four Points a bit lackluster, but clean and efficient.  Not so on this stay.  Bathroom had not been cleaned well, with LOTS of hair in shower drain and on surfaces.  The products in the bathroom, individual sizes, had been used previously.  No washcloths.  Perhaps I just caught the cleaning staff on an off day. Cleaning staff did not check alarm ( and I forgot to check or unplug), so the alarm went off at 4 am, a rude awakening.   My real complaint is that my room was unsuited for desk work.  The desk has large flat-screen tv bolted to the middle of the desktop.  On one side is a recessed tray for all of their promotional and informational materials, leaving a small corner of the desk available to use as a desk.  As I arrived late, and just in from an;2
There is nothing wrong with this hotel...but there is nothing great about it either. The room we stayed in was pretty dated but the bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean which is really all you need in an airport hotel. The shuttle was efficient and the driver helpful with our bags, the only other staff interaction we had was a check in, and the staff member was polite without being over the top.  We also used the Hilton nearby on our return and found it to be a much nicer property at a similar price and would probably not stay at the Sheraton Four Points again.;3
"Sheraton should be ashamed to have its name on this place. Or room's window faced into the hallway, making for a dark, claustrophobic feel. We switched rooms because the bathroom fan wouldn't turn off and the noise was really annoying. The bathroom door also didn't close properly. We were put in a room of the same type down the hall.   Apparently we were in the ""old wing"", so if you do stay there, ask to be in the renovated wing. I hear it is much nicer.  The breakfast is not cheap, nor is it good.   The staff were pleasant and pretty helpful. Some were very helpful. I was just shocked at the quality of our rooms given the Sheraton brand.";2
Good location close to the airport. The wait for the shuttle from the terminal to the hotel look longer. But the rooms are OK for an overnight stay. value for money.;3
I stayed at the Four Points for night while I was in town for a business meeting.  Overall it was a good experience and I would stay there again.  Pro's Very good price. The lobby and rooms were in good shape and were up to date.  They had nice computers in the lobby, free wifi, and the amenities you would expect. The service at the front desk and restaurants were excellent. I had a late dinner at the bar and the food was good and the beer selection was great.    Cons Overall the room was good, but there was a musty odor upon entering the room, and the wallpaper in the bathroom was starting to peel.   I had the breakfast buffet and it was ok.  They had a decent variety, but it wasn't that good of quality for a $20 breakfast.  I would probably skip the buffet and spend the money;4
I always love a hotel that makes life easy! Travel is hard to that is important. They have a great gym, shuttle to and from airport. Airport is 5 minutes away. Big rooms and a GREAT gym. Starbucks in the lobby is great too. Great staff. One thing that I do not like is having to pay for wifi. I think that is crappy but everything else was great and good price. I will stay again.;4
It's not really swanky, but it was very clean and comfortable.  It was worth the price and it's very close to the airport and car rental places.  I'd stay here again.;4
I had a very pleasant stay at the Four Points Sheraton at LAX.  The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, with a large screen television (no high def channels but I was told they are coming soon) and free WiFi throughout the hotel. There is a free shuttle to/from the airport, which I did not use because I had a rental car.  I was upgraded to a junior suite, which was a pleasant surprise, and got a coupon for a free beer-- there is a nice bar downstairs with a good selection of microbrews on tap.  It was nice to see the prices for telephone calls clearly posted next to the phone.   I would definitely stay here again, especially if I had to catch an early flight out of LAX.;5
Our shuttle driver was excellent. At four in the morning, he was bright and helpful. Nice to have that kind of service so early in the AM.;4
"Our night at Four Points Sheraton was one of our top hotel experiences:  The location was perfect, the rooms comfortable with amazing beds and pillows! The high point was the level of personal and friendly service.  From the Four Points airport shuttle drivers to the helpful and welcoming folks at the front desk, all of our needs were met with a smile.  I would recommend the LA Four Points Sheraton to any and all of my friends.  Several times I've thought it should be renamed and called the ""Five Points Sheraton.""  Thanks again to all who gave us such a great stay.";5
We spent one night here before an early morning flight out of LAX. It was a great place to stay at the end of a wonderful, but tiring week in Ca.  It was super convenient to the airport, with a shuttle running every few minutes. It's also very convenient to most of the car rental returns. We were able to return our car the night before our flight, and walk back to the hotel which was only one block away.    I was really suspect of the hotel before we arrived because it was very reasonably priced. I thought surely for a hotel in LA to be so inexpensive it couldn't have been very good, but it was a very pleasant surprise. It's a very attractive hotel with very modern and comfortable rooms.   Our only complaints really were with the staff. First, while we were checking in, we found;4
great value, great service and great property. strong recommended;5
In LA for business at the Sheraton LAX.  You couldn't ask for a better location -- three minutes from the airport.  You do get a bit of noise from the air traffic but not so noticeable that it is problematic.  The rooms are spacious the regular amenities.   What I care about:  Internet:  3 star -- 12.95 / day but at least there is free Internet in the lobby Breakfast:  3 stars -- OK and you can order a la carte Pillows:  4 stars -- lots and comfortable too Towels:  3.5 stars -- not fluffy but comfortable and a good size Water pressure:  5 stars -- have it your way ... excellent  Restaurant could use more staff.;4
ATtractive hotel with very good room service food and efficient friendly staff.  Their policy comes through as a desire to make the stay about you and they know how to do it.;5
great place to stay and for the money we paid for our room you would have thought you staying in a 4 star hotel.;5
Fair rates, good service, comfortable bed, adequate parking.  We will use this hotel again!;5
We have stayed here after a long transatlantic flight and have made a pleasant experience. Staff was nice and friendly. Room was spacious and comfortable. To our big surprise, the hotel was very quiet despite its proximity to LAX.  I found the parking fee of 20 USD on a high side though, there are options in the same area for airport parking which were considerably cheaper. Other than that no complaints - would stay here again.;4
Spent the night at this hotel prior to leaving on a business trip.  It was important for me to have a quick, trouble-free experience before leaving.  I must say, I had a nice stay.  The highlight was the customer service.  Everyone was very nice, including the restaurant staff, the concierge, housekeeping, and the front desk staff.  A special thanks to Adam at the front desk.  He was exceptional in his care, demeanor, and professionalism.    The rooms are updated.  The beds are comfortable.  There is a flat screen TV.  Free WiFi.  The hotel is very close to LAX.  A shuttle runs 3 times an hour and I was at my terminal in 10 minutes!  There is a restaurant and bar.  I only used the restaurant for their breakfast buffet.  It was simple, yet all the basics are there and the food;4
"Flew to LA for a wedding.  This review will cover both ends of the trip.  Staff was very friendly, although there never seemed to be enough staff (only one person) at check-in to handle both lines ('normal' and Starwood Preferred).  This is one of the best Four Points in which I have ever stayed.  Being Platinum gave me a room upgrade.  Very nice touch on the 2nd stay was the cookies and fruit waiting for us in our room.  My biggest disappointment was that my son left his jacket in the room.  We called the hotel the next day, but ""they couldn't find it"".  Asked again when we checked in 6 days later - no luck.  How can you not find a jacket left hanging in an empty room?  Makes me wonder if someone's son has a new jacket.  Excellent location if you are renting a car.  Budget is";4
The rate on hotels.com is not as cheap as the rate on the hotel webpage itself! Plus, For a few dollars more, I was able to snag breakfast, better room, and even a voucher for southwest. The staff was amazing and accommodating as I was exhausted from my flight. Love this place. I'd stay here again if I'm stupid with enough to book a flight with a 9hr layover in LAX again. :);5
"On our return home from a lengthy vacation and staying a night at the Four Points LAX we found on looking at our bank statement that this hotel had removed funds some eleven days after our checkout . The charge $20.90 was for self-parking for one night , when we clearly had not parked . It has taken nearly two hours of my time in communicating with the hotel chain to have the hotel refund this charge . The hotel assistant desk manager was condescending , did not apologize and I have been advised that the matter was a "" misunderstanding "" . I have been advised by this hotel that I will have to meet the bank charges incurred . It is my belief that such a charge is not a misunderstanding as businesses have systems in place to record services provided to guests , and where a service";2
I recently stayed at Four Points was very happy with the both the service and quality of the hotel. The staff was very friendly as they patiently answered all my questions during check-in and also helped me with finding a great place to eat. What i also liked was availability of many computers in the lobby from where I could easily print out my boarding pass and didn't have to wait in line. Overall I was impressed with the hotel and would stay there again.;5
We arrived early as all flights do from Australia. The young lady on Check in that morning advised us that the room was not quite ready, she made a phone call and asked for a quick make over on our room. We sat in the foyer and she had the room ready in no time at all. We had a pleasant rest in the room before heading out to Santa Monica for the afternoon.  Will stay here again, close to Airport & great shuttle service;4
The staff here is so helpful and really makes your stay enjoyable. I will definitely stay here in the future.;5
Excellent hotel.Couldn't ask for more.Everything went on smoothly from check-in to Check-out.Early check-in was honored.No additional charges .Service was nice.Will stay here again.;5
This is a great hotel close to LAX with and awesome shuttle service to LAX.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.;5
Hotel is decent, rooms OK, and while we both had rooms facing the airport no issues sleeping because of noise.  A little disappointing in that the service is just so-so at this hotel, some front desk people were nice, some were inconvenienced by the guests checking in.  The price is more reasonable than other brand name hotels in the area so I would say the value is good.  If you park around back be sure to pull all they way around as the hotel back door is very far from the entrance to the parking lot.;3
Missed my flight to SFO, so stuck at LAX.    Location was convenient.  It was after midnight, and I was still able to get food at their bar.  Room was decent, but I was only their for 6 hours.;3
This hotel has been nicely amenitized over the years, and the lobby is open and inviting, and food is decent to good. My one complaint, and it may not be relevant to you, but as a business traveler, I was SHOCKED to discover the hotel offered no access to either CNBC or Bloomberg. As a business traveler who relies on market data I find it unacceptable that a property in the US would not make available through their their cable or satellite provider access to at the very least CNBC. I have NEVER stayed at ANY property in the WORLD where this channel was not offered, except in some South American countries where at least Bloomberg was provided. Easily 4 star hotel with this one simple change.;3
We found this hotel great for our purposes.  Shuttle was convenient and check in/out staff helpful even arranged a late checkout without any problem.   Room (435) was large with a very comfortable king size bed,  very clean and had a fridge which was necessary as we stayed 6 nights.  Loved the pool, which was large enough to have a proper swim.  We did not drive so found the trolley bus to Manhattan Beach and Manhattan Beach Village Shopping Centre convenient.  We also used the public buses to get to Downtown LA, the Getty Centre, LACMA and other places.  Bus stops very close by.  Concierge not that helpful with info on the public buses.  We made use of the guest laundry and in general found the hotel great.  We will definitely stay at this hotel again.  The bar had a good range;4
We booked this hotel for day use before flying to Australia.  We only needed an afternoon nap, not a full night sleep, but I did notice that the rooms were not soundproofed well enough for an airport hotel.  Shuttle was free, frequent and easy to find.  Free Wifi in the rooms was good.  Room service meals very expensive (Caesar salad, pizza and 3 drinks $60).  Beds confortable, check-in efficient, rooms small. I think I prefer the Hilton.;4
My waiter for breakfast was Jesus Gutierrez.  He was the only employee at the hotel that always remembers me.   I stay there every other month.........  They need more/better bartenders at their bar.  Very disorganized.  The beds are the most comfortable !!!  Better than anywhere else we have stayed.;4
The guy at the front desk (Baltazar) i think his name was, was rude. Seem very unpleasant and un friendly. Did not ask if we needed anything or if they meet our needs. Parking is 19 dollars a Day if you have a car. The restaurant there was ok, we ordered wings and the lady comes back said they had no wings!?! really what kind of hotel are you guys with no buffalo wings. So we had to opt for something else on the menu. Lastly im a Gold member and as a Gold member you get a welcome basket, Did i get one? Nope and i wasn't didnt get treated like one as well.;3
Had a mix up with the booking and found myself with a cancelled booking in the system.  The front office girl was very friendly and helpful and made sure everything was sorted out and I had a room .  It was 7 a.m in the morning and after flying from Australia really needed to sleep.   The shuttle bus to LAX was reliable (something we have not found at several other hotels in the area) and the wake up call actually occurred.  Downstairs bar and grill there were more great staff and excellent food.  Overall a good experience and would stay at this hotel again when passing through LAX.;4
We always use Four Points by Sheraton at LAX when stopping over in LA. Each time we have found check in simple and hassle free. The rooms are always clean and many have been renovated. Some of the renovated rooms do not have fridges anymore so you may need to use the ice bucket provided. The beds are very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its ease of access to the airport and car hire facilities. As others say it has free WiFi, a heated pool and if you are in and out of the carpark within 30 minutes it is free - this is good to know as there is limited space at the front of the hotel for drop off. There is also a free shuttle to the airport. We are always made to feel welcome and will continue to use the hotel in future.;5
Front desk staff was friendly and the room was very clean and comfortable.  It was conveniently located to our particular rental car drop off and very close to the airport.  The parking lot had plenty of room and coming and going was easy.  Despite being so close to the airport, sounds of the air traffic were not noticeable.  There was a pub downstairs which was nice, though beer prices seemed a little high by our standards, though probably fairly normal by Los Angeles standards.  Overall, a good room for the price and we would have no problems staying there again.;4
"We stayed here for 3 nights to relax and unwind before ending our vacation. Airport Close, but far enough away.  The lobby bar was relaxing, and the Selection of Beers from Belgian to more Local Craft was outstanding.  Free WiFi, clean room and VERY Comfortable Bed.  To quote Arnold, ""I will be Back !!!""";5
This hotel is located just a few minutes away from the airport. The shuttle service is ok, it runs by every 15-20 mins and goes to other 2 hotels, so the right might take awhile.   Pros: Free Shuttle Service. Room is clean and comfortable.  Cons: the restaurants in the hotel are already a bit old, and the service was pleasant but slow. While I sat there, 3 different waiters came over to take my order and I had to wait around 30 mins for my meal. The food reminded me of Dennys.;3
Not much else need be said.  Noisy.  But you have to take that with the terriority.  Nothing negative or positive I recall;3
Stayed here for just a quick overnight. The rooms were good sized. The bar is always a welcome addition after a long day on the road. Parking's not free but the cost isn't too bad for an airport property near LAX. The late-night staff was terrific!;4
We stayed here as a couple in nov. 2011 . The free shuttle from the airport was not that great , we had to wait for it for nearly 45 minutes . Again afer we reached the hotel , we were made to wait nearly 30-45 minutes to give us the room. After these hiccups , it was very smooth . Room was excellent . Staff was very friendly . The travel desk was very good , they gave us all info for local places and arranged for it .  overall a good experience .;4
We stayed at the end of our trip before headed home.  It was very convenient to the airport.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  Our room was upgraded to a newly refurbished wing.  I believe it was on the west end of the building.  Complimentary wi-fi!  Room was perfectly clean and even passed the white sock test.  the carpets were clean!  The beds are plush and comfortable... white linens.  We enjoyed our stay!  Parking was $19/day... that was probably the only downer.  Although it was convenient to accessing the room/elevator.  We would definitely stay again if we needed a location close the airport.;4
Stayed here while on my way to China.  Easy access from the airport via shuttle. No hassle check in and check out.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.   I would definitely stay here again.;4
I felt safe, secure and comfortable in this hotel.  It is close to the airport and that is what I wanted.  It is NOT a dump.  Believe me, there are dumps in LAX.  Everyone was helpful and professional (shuttle driver, check-in clerk, check-out clerk, concierge).  I ate in the hotel restaurant and the waitress was superb.  I will definitely stay here again when I have an overnight.;5
The staff was very friendly! The lobby and halls were very clean as well as the rooms and bathrooms. The only thing is that the room we stayed in didnt have a fridge. I was told that some have them and others dont. That was the only minor details but aside of that everything was perfect.;5
I booked this hotel for a business trip at $149, I am a Starwood member, but not elite. It's a short shuttle ride from the airport (with one stop first at the Westin).  The property itself is older, even though it looks like they've tried to renovate it. The rooms were nice mostly, with newer amenities (flat panel tv, ac hookups).  Bathtubs definitely were worn (mildew) and tile was not very clean (hair all over).  I had the breakfast buffet one day and it was pricey for what I got. When you add it all up, it was $20-$30 a night cheaper than comparable offerings closeby. For that, I give it 4*'s for the value.;4
Pros: - Close to airport  Cons: - Terrible staff - Understaffed - Over-crowded shuttle - Lousy food - Old gym equipment  In my opinion, this is absolutely a second-rate Sheraton property.  It was a mistake on my part booking this hotel when there is a real Sheraton about 2 blocks away, but I've stayed at other Four Points and they have been fine.  The afternoon front desk clerk was pleasant when checking in, but a heavy-set female clerk checking guests out in the morning had an attitude like guests are an inconvenience.  There was one bartender and one waiter working their butts off in the bar/restaurant, trying to take care of about 10 tables plus the bar.  After about 10-15 minutes without being able to order, I got up and left.  It was not the fault of the employees, they;2
We booked this hotel for overnight before a cruise.  Shuttle driver was helpful and when arriving at hotel staff were friendly and helpful, took baggage right away and pointed us to checkin.  Brought bags up to room promptly and were informative about shuttle to Manhattan Beach.  Hotel room was clean and bright.Ate dinner and breakfast at hotel.  Dinner was very good, we ate early so service was good as not too busy.  Breakfast buffet is good and good value for money, although service was a bit slow, but very busy.  Would stay at this hotel again.;4
We had to stay overnight for an early flight from LAX. This was a decent enough hotel although the price was a little high at $200+ on a Wed night.  We had a bite at the bar downstairs as that was the only dining available.  The shuttle service the next day was quite nice and comfortable.  The clerk took the time to sign us up for Starwood points.;4
I spent one night here after getting back from Thailand and before heading to the East coast.  The shuttle van took a while.  The hotel itself was very disappointing.  It is a dump.  It really needs some attention.  There was paint peeling off the elevator, scuff marks on the wall, just an overall feeling of lack of maintenance.  It was not expensive, but for what it was it was too much.  There was someone else's hair on the bathroom counter when I checked in.  I got to listen to the shuttle stop outside my room all night make an announcement that it was the airport shuttle.  There is not a closet in the room, just a rod.  If you want just a place to dump your luggage then this is okay.  The coffee shop did not have bagels, just large breakfast platters.  When I asked at the;2
I wasn't looking for anything special, just something close enough to the airport so I wouldn't have to sit in LA traffic and this place was perfect. Modern hotel and very clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful. One of the employees actually took the time to show me exactly where my room was even though I did not ask, it was pretty helpful. The only issue I experienced while I stayed there was that our keys to the room stopped working after one use. I got back pretty late and had to go all the way back to the lobby and get a new key. The same happened to a friend of mine the next day. A little annoying. Also having to pay 20 bucks a day for parking is a bit much. I think it should be complimentary for its guests. If you are planning to stay here and also need a rental I;4
Well located comfy airport hotel. Well managed and exceeds expecations. Repeat stayer would do again in the future.  Great priced for value.;4
i bought a discount room here online in australia at the airport and my only need was that the room be ready when i got off the plane so i could meet my friends in LA later that day before traveling onward the next day. so i was fairly non plussed when i had to wait three hours for a room that had been booked for a specific time. the clerk told me apparently you need to pay an extra $20 to have a time guaranteed. so heads up about that.   otherwise it was fine, nothing standout good or bad.;3
"We arrived at nearly 10 pm for a very brief layover, leaving at 6:30 the next morning.  We had an ""upgraded"" room, so I'm not sure how it compared with others.   The most striking thing about the room was how small it was, yet the hotel made terrific use of the space.   The decor was very modern and pleasantly unique.   Stylish bins replaced drawers, and the clean simple lines everywhere were appealing.  We immediately ordered room service while settling in.   The food was decent, albeit nothing to write home about.   $50 for two of us for a burger, an omelette, and 2 soft drinks.   Welcome to the price of room service.   ;-)  There was a handy table stored -under- the desk that I pulled out and ate on.   It was just right.   Kudos for those little touches.  While we didn't have";4
If you are looking for great service and price, this is the place.  After a long drive from Arizona and attending the race, we were very impressed with the quick check in.  The rooms were clean and bed very comfortable.  We told friends and family of our pleasant stay.;5
After a tiring 10 days of travels it was nice to greeted so warmly at check in. Check in took only around 5 minutes which was perfect. Our room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The free shuttle to and from the airport is a bonus and very convenient with my flight coming in late. I have already recommended this hotel to our Kiwi's travelling in & out of LA Airport. Keep up the great service I will be staying again for sure.;5
The best thing about this hotel is the free shuttle & soft bed. Of course having spent two weeks sleeping on hard as board beds in Asia anything would be soft. We arrived at midnight and there was a pretty good size group at check-in, the reception was immediaetly overwelmed and though we were 3rd in line it took 30 minutes to get to us. The room was crapmed with two beds but did contain a refrig, light swicthes were installed crooked, waterstains under the sink & in the tub, thin small towels. Breakfast bufett uninspired though Patti our server was was very nice and efficient once we got served. Sheraton Four Points very disappointing.;2
We arrive the hotel very late and tired. But front desk staff check in very fast and we can go to our room immediately.  The room is very clean and bed is very confortable. Also the 24 hours check in/out service is really excellent. I can take a shower before I go to the airport. I will recommendate to my friends definitely.;5
Was a guest Mon 05/14/12, arrive @ approx 11pm. First room television was not working. The engineer made every effort to repair. Je call the front desk and ask for another room. He was very attentive, advised he would let me in so I didn't have to walk to the front desk and asked for a key to be sent. Never happened...next they sent my husband up around midnight, without asking. He didn't know which room I was in, he only knew I was there. In our situation nit a problem. I thought it was policy not to give room numbers. Anyway, there wewas re no face towel. Anyway, we had to return Weds. our room was in a weird corridor. Not appealing at all. Thats it;3
The hotel itself is very clean and stylish.  The room was clean and very comfortable.  The bar, restaurant and other staff were very pleasant and helpful. A great value for the cost.;5
We spent 2 nights in this hotel, on the first and last days of our vacation.   Nice room, easy check in.    Very comfortable bed and all was clean.    EASY access to Budget Car Rental across the street.   A continental breakfast would have been nice, and would have earned the hotel an extra circle in my rating!    Pricey restaurant was on property.   Heard airplanes all night long, but it wasn't unbearable.;4
I travel for work often and up until May 6th, the hotels that I have stayed at were ok. The Four Points by Sheraton has really raised the bar on where I stay!  Awesome, staff, facility, and rooms! The decor and the cleaniness of the hotel was outstanding! Would definately stay here again!!!;5
My wife and I use LAX about 10 times per year. We always stay at the Four Points Sheraton LAX before and after flying. The hotel is great and very convenient. The staff knows us and always give us wonderful service. We have been doing this for years and, hopefully, will continue to do so for many more.;5
I really enjoyed my stay here. The bus stop is around the corner and takes you to Santa Monica, Venice Beach and other sites for $1!!  Room service was quick an tasty.  Staff were friendly.   My flight left at midnight. They had decent rates which meant I could check out at 9pm, ready for my 13 hour flight home!! It was perfect!;5
Staff gave super service from front door thru entire stay.  Housekeeping very helpful with our erratic college graduation schedule.  Spent much more of our dining budget at this hotel than we planned as the food was excellent, prices were competitive and service was friendly, efficient but not an overkill. Staff even helped with parking.  Pool and all public areas were immaculate and room was high-end comfort. at an affordable price,  No problems - all pleasure.  Has been our family's LA destination hotel for 5 years and will be into the future.  Great!!!;5
"We just came from another Starwood Hotel in Santa Monica, which was clean, nice, good service, perfect rooms. That's why we chose this Hotel. It was in so poor condition and looked cheap with the decoration and everythin, plastic cups and so on. We have booked a de luxe room with 2 Kingsize beds. But they don't have a room with two King size beds. We have booked a de luxe room, and it looked like a motel from a bad C-movie. At this here hotel ""de luxe"" means bette intrieur,then I don't want to see a regular room. Three good things to say about the hotel. Free wi-fi in the room, nice pool and perfect distance to the airport, when you have to catch an early flight.";2
Staff was friendly and hotel was comfortable and clean. Room was nice as well, only problem was that it had big windows facing the corridor and you could hear everything going on outside, so no privacy. We tried to use the hotel as a base to explore LA, but as we had no car it was a nightmare to get from the hotel to other areas. Be aware that public transportation in LA is terrible, slow and dirty. I would only recommend the hotel for a short stay and if there is need to stay close to the airport, but not for sightseeing or leisure. TIP: If you want to book a tour, the tour company office is around 15 minutes walking from the hotel, where you pay for it. I recommend heading there as if you book through the hotel, they will charge you a booking fee and commission, plus they will;4
The worst hotel we've ever stayed in.  We checked in in the evening and the staff members were not friendly at all.  It was deceiving--the lobby was nice and clean but the room was gross.  It was dingy and dark and dirty.  The ceilings were even dirty.  We stayed here one night because it was close to LAX but I would never ever stay here again.  We didn't sleep well because we thought we might catch something.  We were disappointed because it's a Starwood hotel and we expected much better.  We paid around $100 to stay the night but even that was too much.;1
As a platinum with Starwood, I've seen a lot of their properties all over the world.  On the whole they're pretty good, which is why I usually Starwood when I have the opportunity.  And they usually reward my loyalty with pretty good service and cool benefits like free breakfast and room upgrades.  This particular one, though, is one of the really terrible ones.  I arrived late, around 11:30 p.m., and was told my room wasn't available.  This is surprising because usually my room is blocked out for me.  So I had to wait for a bit, which was especially disappointing because I had to get up very early the next morning for my flight.  The room was tiny, really tiny, and there was no window except a window next to the door that looked out onto the hallway.  The amazing thing is that;1
Good price and location. There was one problem. I ordered two rooms with 2 Double beds. But when I was check-in there was no that rooms. While I was parking my car they find it and everything was fine;4
We had to over night in LAX due to an early flight. Four Points Sheraton was close to hotel. Free shuttle bus to and from hotel to LAX. We got a newly refubished room. Ate dinner in the hotel found it a little expensive but I guess when there is nothing really else around they can do that. Staff remember our names and ensured that we were OK. You wont have any problems for an over night here to unwind refresh ready for the next phase of your trip;5
The hotel lobby and restaurant are very nice and the location for airport access is outstanding.  The shuttle service is convenient and timely.  I stayed in the center wing and it had a bit of a Motel feel.  The hallway seemed like an enclosed external walkway and the room quality is in line with what you would expect from a place with outside doors.  The lobby, reception and registration were vastly different from my room.  West tower may be better.  Overall, not bad and I would stay again if it were a very short stay with an early flight.;3
Stayed here for one night ( less than 8 hours) due to Delta cancel flight.  The room is clean and spacious. The walkway can be confusing and abit dark but if stay just for a transit then no problem.  Free shuttle every 20 minute to LAX with a stop at Westin. Helpful staffs;4
Our second stay here and again we were impressed with the convenient location, clean and comfortable rooms, good value and particularly the courteous service offered by Lizette at the check-in counter. A great choice of accommodation at LAX.;4
We stayed here for one night whilst passing through LA.  The room (in the east tower), although fresh and clean, was very cramped with two queen beds and there was barely enough room to move around.  The air conditioner was old and noisy and the TV remote worked intermittently, then not at all, so I had to call the maintenance guy in to replace it (he explained that all of the older style remotes were giving problems, so they were replacing them as people complained!).  The desk staff were superficially friendly, and signed me up to the Sheraton Starwood Preferred Guests programme.  The gentleman at the desk implied that we had been allocated a better room after I had done this, so I wonder what sort of room we would have got had I not signed up?  The location is good for LAX,;3
I enjoyed staying at the Sheraton 4 Points LAX. The shuttle bus was convenient, the gym and pool were nice.  The lobby is airy and spacious as are the rooms.  I stayed 2 nights in 2 different rooms.  My only complaint is the air conditioning is very noisy.;4
I stayed at this hotel few times before and after the renovation.  I usually get put into one of their renovated wings (Facing Burger King) and I was impressed!  Pro:  1. Good size pool 2. Friendly Staff 3. Big bathroom!  Their bathroom size is bigger than most of the airport hotels! Love the shower pressure. 4. Quiet AC and good sound proof windows 5. Comfortable Bed and TV 6. Free Wifi. 7. Free Shuttle with very frequent (~15mins) pickup to/from LAX. 8. Free Water in the room, replenished daily.  Con: 1. Wifi Can be Slow. 2. Parking is good but the parking meter is a pain in the crack.   It often don't function well so cars behind have to keep waiting for attendant to talk to you over the speaker. 3. Elevators, its really , really slow  Tip: Book the package with parking can;4
This hotel was comfortable, clean and had a great access to all the main sites in LA. The room is big enough, the bed is comfortable and the shower is nice and hot. It is a simple room, not stylish and there is no fridge in the room. There is a parking lot right next to it that you can use to park the car yourself and save some money.  It is $13 a day to park and they provide you a day pass, which is great, because then you can come and go, and only pay once per day.   It is a good hotel, and it has a pretty good Italian restaurant. We'd stay here again.;4
food was very good, service was top notch and for 125.00 per nite great deal in this area;4
Rooms were big with nice furnishings, and very quiet despite being very close to LAX. The gym was one of the best I've seen at a hotel, though still not as good as at most sports clubs. Front desk was helpful, but very busy with a sometimes long wait. The bar food was really bad but the waitstaff were friendly and provided good service. Self-parking is a bit of a walk in a very crowded open lot. The concierge floor provided a nice, though sparsely decorated, spot for snacks and breakfast. Excellent value for the price.;4
This hotel has everything for a stopover in Los Angeles and is convenient for travel into Santa Monica,a blue bus takes you there for a few dollars,and stops near the outlets not far from the beach/pier. The staff are friendly and helpfull and work hard to make the stay enjoyable,the bar and eating places are clean spacious and food excellent,buffet breakfast for a good price,bars with televisions for sport and good selection of drinks/food. There is a shuttle bus to the terminals with friendly helpfull drivers,highly recommended for a stay to be near the airport and easy access to nearby beach towns. Good wifi internet.;5
Great rate and the staff was so friendly and helpful! The rooms were beautiful and beds really comfy! Shuttle from Airport to Hotel was quick and location is great close to everywhere. Would highly recommend staying there. Restaurant was very good service and food excellent. Work out rooms is better than most gym's! and the pool was heated.;5
We have stayed here many times before. Friendly people, great ambience. It makes our stay relaxing and enjoyable , would recommend it any time;4
The beds are very comfortable and I love the soft doona blankets. My room 431 faced the main road and every evening I had beautiful golden sunsets. Even though the airport is very nearby but you can never hear the planes. The rooms are large and contains the usual shampoo, conditioner, soaps and skin lotion. Good selection of TV. Only downside is that it's not near any convenience store. Burger King is closest diner you can get.;4
The Sheraton is conveniently located at the LAX airport only 5 minutes away by free courtesy shuttle.  The checkout was excellent and quick.  Room was clean, modern and not lacking any amenities including WI-FI for internet.  The breakfast buffet had a large selection of fresh cooked food and fresh fruit bar.  I will return to this property for business any time I arrive in LAX.  Completely satisfied, the staff could not have been more courteous and helpful;5
Was in LA for a couple of days business and the Four Points Sheraton I've come to find is an ideal location for access to the city and airport.  They have a very nice work out facility and too an outdoor pool open til 10pm - quite nice after a long flight or before one.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable, clean and secure.  The restaurant serves a wide range for breakfast both buffet or a la carte.  And it's interesting, even next to the airport, there's hardly any noise.  I guess more so since the planes don't land or take off during the night.  I will stay here again.;5
When you visit this hotel, please be sure to ask for a renovated room (8th floor) at the front desk. On arrival, my colleagues and I were placed in older rooms, because renovated rooms were not available at that time. It was not only the room that shocked me, but the entire floor. It reminded me of a motel, rather than a comfortable, conference hotel. I located my room behind a large, beat-up kitchen-style door that led to a narrow hallway. My room was the last room on the row with a huge picture window. I have never seen anything like this before, and as a single woman, I felt completely exposed, despite the curtain. Also, the shower head was non-working.  On requesting another room, I was told that I could wait for a renovated room. I had no idea that some rooms were renovated;2
I stayed here for 1 night for a conference, then decided to go next door to the Renaissance.  Pros- Free WiFi nice gym good pool nice staff bed was comfortable  Cons- Loud loud loud.   Airplanes overhead- but I have stayed at other hotels in the area and the noise was not nearly as bad.  And you could hear everything outside.  The insulation must be awful.  I turned the fan on full blast to try to keep the noise down the ceilings are low, making it feel like a cheap hotel it's like they put an awesome Westin bed in a motel 6 room.  I hear parking was terrible, but didn't try it.  So, after only getting 4 hours of interrupted sleep I was done.  I moved to another hotel.    Not the staff's fault that the bones of this hotel are bad.  They were very nice at check-in and check-out,;2
Comfortable hotel with good amenities at a good price. Lots of freebies for frequent travelers which is always nice! Pool area cabanas during the week make for nice meeting spots although internet is not great out there. Decent food, good service and overall attentive staff.;4
"I was surprised and delighted during my last stay at this wonderful hotel, when I was about to check-in, the very friendly and happy staff at the front desk told me that my upgrade to junior suite has been already arranged. To be honest, it was my very first time as a SPG memeber experiencing this, without even asking for it,  they did it in a very nice way that made me feel so at home.  Late check-out, and all the rest of the perks were automatically given, hassle free all the way .  I would like not only to recommend this ""value for the money"" hotel, but more because of their staff, from concierge to the manager, everybody goes the extra mile to satisfy your needs.  Congratulations and continue to be the best choice around LAX !";5
It's time we start sharing with TripAdvisor, instead of  just reading others' reviews. We have stayed at this hotel  5 or 6 times, the last time being in September,2011.  We  live in the greater L.A. area, and this property provides  both a room the night before and an early morning departure from LAX, as well as an excellent parking rate...usually  around $185.00 for the single night as well as 14 days free  parking.  This combined with its close proximity to LAX ...one of the closest hotels, and its 24 hour shuttle  service, makes it an excellent choice for our purpose.   The rooms tend to be a bit old, but the bed is always  comfortable.  Thanks to both Peter Kolla and Phil Baxter, as well as the great quick service at the front desk and with room service. We'll be back again;5
We choose the four points because of its ideal location to lax airport and car hire company. It was only a twenty minute wall to Alamo. The website looked good and reviews were mostly favorable too. The hotel on  arrival was very nice, check in was friendly. Bar was good, more than a few beers to choose from and food was ok too. The room however was sadly in need of redecoration and let the hotel down badly. It was not of a standard we would expect from this chain. On top of this our room had not been prepared properly, the toilet had been used and not flushed, bin not emptied and no soap. There were a few defects which to be fair to the staff, when we gave them the list they were very grateful and very apologetic. They even refunded us our dinner bill to show how sorry they;4
Front desk ok, close to lax, Made reservation for 3 people, gave us a king size bed for 3 dudes. Gave us excuse it wasnt guaranteed, booked third party, etc etc... Um, lil tight for us three. Front desk did offer a rollout bed, but too tired to wait etc. Slept on floor instead. Room was small, it was ok, was happier at the la Quinta across the street last time.  If that was the case I would had priceline a hotel next time.;2
Had 12 hours at LAX to burn. Booked a room here and managed to confirm an 11am check in. Which was a relief as I wanted to make sure I could do this. Beds were super comfy, bathroom was very spacious and clean, good lighting - no horrible harsh lighting. Room service food was great. Guy at front helped me get bags onto free shuttle which was appreciated. Only complaint would be the 5 minute wait in line for check out, but staff were very friendly when I got there.;5
I love to go Brewsters mainly because of Chris' service. She's a great bartender and you get to sample the beer before buying it. The ambiance is right and she's always smiling and so you know that it's always pleasant to be here. It's comfortable & clean and burgers are just delicious~;5
I was very disappointed with my room! It smelled like death and smoke! Old style decor! Old sink with tacky pipes showing underneth sink. Outside corridor was old and smelly! Terrible view, unless you like early Parking lot! I stayed at Motel 6 motels that were better! I believe because I was with a Company seminar class and because my company paid in advanced, the Hotel gave me the room a tad above the Bates Motel!....;1
Room was small, A/C shakes and makes lots of noise,  Be careful of the various elevators that lead you to hallways of rooms and no one to direct you to your room...  Burger King across the street and Dennys down the street...;3
Stayed here recently for one night in a traditional King room.  The room and bathroom were HUGE.  The bathroom was modern white on white that included a subway-tile shower surround.  The bed was very comfortable and the room (facing Airport Blvd) was quiet. The front desk staff were helpful and courteous.  Several other LAX hotels in the area are fairly worn down so the Four Points was a refreshing change.  Will stay here again when without hesitation or considering other hotels in the immediate area.;4
We actually stayed here at the beginning & ending of our trip to CA.  Our room the first 2 nights was very nice.  It was in the East or West Tower - very quiet, clean, & confortable.  On our last night in LA we were in the Center Tower - cheaper, clean, & comfortable. I booked a deal online to pay upfront & we got a good rate on our room that last night.  The downside was that we heard everything people said or did as they walked by our room - it was very noisy most of the night.  I don't know if this was the original part of the hotel, but I would try to avoid it if you can.  We didn't however notice any noise from the airport being nearby which is always a plus.  The bar/restaurant didn't have a lot of food choices for kids, but our girls managed. The breakfast at the other;4
"There are a great many LAX options, and all serve one purpose: convenience for those late-night/early-morning flights.  This hotel is no different really. It is convenient, and it will not impress you particularly with anything else.   1. The room will be small-but-serviceable.  2. The toilet paper holder may come off the wall just like any cheap hotel.  3. The sheets, pillow and duvet will be nice.  4. The tepid breakfast buffet will be $16. 5. The ""updated"" decor will not impress you, though it will be clean. 6. The shuttle bus will take you to another hotel before it takes you to yours in the middle of the night when you're exhausted after flying 6 hours.  7. If you open your window, you'll be able to hear the nice lady at Budget Rental Car talking over the loudspeaker at all";3
Room was comfortable and reasonably silent being next to the airport. Personnel was friendly. The room and the common parts of the building look as they haven't been renewed for a couple of decades, which is a bit of a disappointment for a hotel of this category.;3
I regularly return to the restaurant in the Four Points not only because of the amazing burgers, but also because of the excellent service. Their beer selection is vast, and their knowledgeable staff (Chris comes to mind) can make informed recommendations.  I'll definitely be back many more times in the future. Cheers to many more excellent beers here and our awesome waitress Chris!;5
"Very helpful staff at check in and restaurant/bar. They could not have been nicer.  Many TVs in the restaurant/bar, and seriously LOTS of beers from all over world. Room location was in a ""tower"" reached by exiting the elevator, then walking through an ice/vending-machine room which did NOT look like it led anywhere.....but led to a long narrow hallway lined with windows facing a city view.  But the window for the room itself faced the hall.  So your view was through room window, across the hall, and out hall window.  Of course anyone walking in hall would see into your room, so basically no view since we closed shades. This was described as a special room for Sheraton members.  (I forget what their program is called.)  It was fine for one night with an early next day flight,";3
We got a splendid rate on spg.com for a night in January including parking at this hotel. This is my third stay at this hotel and it still receives great compliments from me. The front desk is very efficient in attending to guest as every airport hotel should be considering the number of guests passing through. Being a SPG gold member, it helps. In my latest stay, I was given in one of the recently renovated rooms. The windows are extremely sound proof from any approaching aircraft into LAX. I have never tried the breakfast here but they do offer a buffet breakfast. I would definitely be back again. If you require a car rental, budget which is directly across the street couldn't be more convenient.;4
"The hotel has 3 towers.  One tower has rooms with windows facing the hallway (like a motel) so when you open the curtains people walking down the hall can see in.  If you are staying for more than a day or two make sure to request a room in one of the other 2 towers.  After getting place in the ""motel tower"" I requested to be moved as I was staying 5 nights.  They moved me to the tower adjacent to Airport Blvd.  The room was nicely update and had a great refrigerator, but the windows are old and are not sound proofed.  Consequently there was a stiff breeze blowing in where the windows didn't quite close (their energy bill must be huge!) and there was a lot of road noise.  So if you are a light sleeper request a room that doesn't face the road.  I should say they also offered to";4
I enjoyed my stay, the service was excellent and everyone was very helpful. I am definitely staying there again.;5
Its 65 degrees in our room and we are cold. They say this section of the hotel doesn't have enough people complaining, to turn on the furnace for this wing. What????;3
I stayed here with my mom during a last minute trip to LA for a funeral.  We had a newly renovated room, which was really nice.  Everyone at the hotel was wonderful.  We had a package that included parking & breakfast buffet, which worked out well.  There was plenty of parking, even at 9:30/10:00 at night.  We had a little glitch with the a/c not working in our first room.  The engineer responded within 10 min, then came up to our room to check it.  When he saw that it really wasn't working, he had the front desk transfer us to another room on the same floor, walked us to the new room and let us in and the front desk sent someone up with the new keys.  All handled quickly and professionally.  The breakfast buffet had plenty of food.  I would definitely stay here again.;5
We booked this as an airport hotel, coming from Australia we needed a sleep   Little did we know, because the web site did not tell us that drilling would occur from  10 am to 6 pm, thus have a sleep was impossible   However it was a beautiful hotel , lovely room very much what you would expect from Starwood   I would come back ,  the food at the bar was great   I did write to wotif about the room and hotel but they have not yet replied.   Overall it was suitable and good value for money.   Be warned the shuttle get full so allow time   Staff were very helpful;5
We were pleasantly surprised as when I checked reviews on both Travel Advisor & other sites, they weren't all that positive.  I booked two rooms using my Aeroplan points & we were given very nice rooms - both with 2 beds in them as we had one another adult & a couple grandchildren with us. The rooms we were given were on the 7th floor next to each other which was very convenient.  Rooms were comfortable, spacious & quiet.  When we arrived, there was a fan of some sort going in the hallway which gave off strong fragrant smell which was a bit overpowering but did not affect our room.  We had a late snack in the bar area  & were able to take the children in with us, finger food was good and beer selection was a great bonus.  Staff we encountered were very helpful & friendly.  All;4
I stayed here last week, 2 nights for business. After many positive reviews and looking at other properties, I finally decided on the Four Points Sheraton LAX. I could tell from the reviews and photos that the property was undergoing a makeover, though the building itself was clearly older. The common areas (lobby, bar/lounge area, etc.) looked fresh and modern. So far so good, and met the expectations I had from doing my Trip Advisor research.  Things fell apart when I got to my room in the middle tower. The only window opened to the hallway. The hallway in turn had (dusty) windows overlooking the pool area. In other words, the original design of this tower is just odd. For privacy, you have to close the curtains or shades and then you have no natural light. There was also a;2
I was at the Four Points Sheraton with a group rate for an intensive 5 days. I'm a Starwood member, so they gave me an automatic upgrade to the 7th floor when I checked in (which was late) which was nice. Being close to the airport was great, as there was no time to go out and see LA. The room was pretty basic, though there was no room safe and the closet space was open! They had baskets instead of drawers, which I was not overly fond of either. I could not work the coffee machine, so left it alone. It was great to have a fridge, as I used it to put in drinks and salads from the convenience store across the road and Burger King. There weren't too many options in the area to buy groceries. The beds were really quite nice - and I slept well. Service in the Comfort restaurant of;3
Good hotel, but mainly incredible beer choice at the bar!;5
From the second we arrived at this hotel, my girlfriend and I were welcomed with open arms and given help with anything we needed! Martin at front desk and Phil the GM were extremely nice and hospitable and really cool cats! The rooms were very comfortable and wow was the lobby bar Brewster's killer! So many amazing and tasty beers to choose from and food very good! All in all a very enjoyable stay!;5
I've always avoided the Four Points brand because of a bad experience many years ago. My company booked my room here for one night so it gave me a chance to see if it's improved. Overall the hotel is very average. The public areas were fine. The bar was pretty good but there was only 1 waitress taking care of the whole place- she was too busy.   The room was okay. The bathroom was extra small- the door hit the toilet when you open the door! There was no soap in my room and the iron seemed to work intermittently.   It was good enough for one night but I'd never book it myself!;3
I always overnight here when I have an early plane to catch. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the price is right. The staff is very pleasant. Brewster's has good food and a great selection of beer. And, the shuttle runs 24X7.;5
Stayed here 2 nights for business, and couldn't access - wireless is unsecured.  Room service delivered my dinner and proceeded to drop/break the wine glass all over the desk/floor.  I had to ask him to get someone to vacuum up the last shards of glass.  On the plus side, they don't charge you for bottled water, and there is a refrigerator.  Breakfast buffet was pretty good, but dinner was just so-so (the chicken on my salad was still partially frozen).  Parking was expensive.  Very close to the airport (you can hear the planes).  Hotel interior a little sad - veneer chipped off the front of the elevators (like someone used a crow bar).  When I tried to take the stairs (because the elevator was so slow), could not get down to the lobby.  Next time will try one of the many other;2
Enjoyed the Bar and the resturant, the lobby was great and the service was awesome;4
"I stayed here for two nights on business.  The lobby and bar area are very nice...food and wine were delicious and not too expensive.   I was surprised at how dark the hallways were of this hotel.  Reminded me of an old strip mall in Mexico...very tough to see where you were going...and far from inviting.  While the rooms are very small, they were fine.  Bed was comfortable; bathroom very basic. It definitely isn't a place you'd want to stay for more than a few quick days.  I was only on the second floor and street noises were very loud.  Luckily, the room has a robust fan, so I left it on the whole time so I could sleep and work in peace.  The biggest disappointment was the hotel wi-fi.  Very weak.  I wouldn't recommend it for people needing to get work done.  It kept booting";3
There is no WiFi in the hotel despite it's listed, but there is no connection.;1

I would like to sing the praises of one of the employees--Israel Mora who adjusted the automatic lights in my room very quickly and efficiently when I stayed at the hotel in November of 2011. When I returned for another business trip 2 weeks ago I just happened to see Israel while I was out in the main area of the hotel. Israel recognized me immediately and welcomed me back to the hotel.  An hour later, there was a knock on my door with Israel delivering a fruit plate and a book on Los Angeles. Needless to say I was thrilled and my stay at the Four Points was enhanced immeasurably!. In addition, all the other employees showed me the same respect and friendliness. You can bet that the next trip that takes me to LA will include staying at the Four Points Sheraton!;5
But nothing special. The bathroom was in desperate need of a makeover. Strange layout, I had no idea bathtubs could be that narrow.   The bed and linens on the other hand, we're heavenly! Even though we were in a room facing the airport, I never heard a plane all night.   We checked in at 2 am and were very happy that they had a late night room service menu. The choices were limited, but that turkey sandwich was worth every cent of that $15 price tag.   Check in was easy, we stayed with Starwood points and were treated very well, even at that early hour. Even got a late check out, 4pm! That was great.   All in all, a pleasant stay in a nice hotel.;4
"We spent a night here passing through Ca; I was impressed, especially for a four points, (I usually stay at Sheraton or Westin) it met my expectations and then some; the rooms were very clean, and the service was excellent, the beds very comfy.  It was conveniently located to places we wanted to visit; (the beach and Hollywood), and right by the airport for the trip out of LA, nice pool area. I will definitely stay there again.";4
At one time Sheraton was a nice place. I have stayed at two in different cities, they were both rundown and past their prime. This hotel is dated and poorly maintained. The carpet in our room was covered in spots and one of the lights was burnt out. The front desk was inefficient. The airport shuttle was timely and courteous.;3
As most people who travel in and out of Los Angeles have learned, it's wise to spend your last night close to the airport. Traffic and car rental returns alone can easily add hours to your flight preparation time. The comfort, cost, courtesy, and convenience of Four Points LAX is unsurpassed. I just wish I would've spent my whole trip there.;5
"I spent a very nice week at the Four Points recently.  I was pleasantly surprised with a welcoming plate of fruit and outstanding ""home baked"" cookies (well they tasted like home baked cookies anyway!).   Despite being able to watch the flights landing at LAX, with the windows closed, I did not hear them day or night.   My room was always ready when I got back, even if I arrived back to work at lunch time. The pillows were to die for - I usually have to plump and rearrange them to get to sleep - not these - wish I could have brought them home with me!   There was always 2 bottles of water left for me daily if I desired. Fresh fruit in the lobby was available most of the day. Free wireless internet was a breeze to use and plenty of bandwidth for my needs.  The bar had a most";4
This is a great hotel. The pool is great, and the restaurant is fantastic. The rooms were large, clean, and among the best we have ever stayed in. The complementary shuttle to the airport is great too. We will always stay here when we travel through LAX and need a hotel for the night.;5
I have stayed at Four Points Sheraton LAX three times over the past year. It has become my hotel of choice. The rooms are clean and well appointed, the water and the Internet are free, the staff is friendly. Parking is costly, but if you are lucky and so inclined, you can find a space on the street within a couple of blocks.;4
"We spent our last night at this location close to Airport,Great Hotel,had a excellent meal and a good night""s sleep before we departed foe British Columbia.The shuttle service was great and the driver most helpful with our baggage,hope to stay there in the future";4
Clean rooms, attractive lobby, good location for catching early morning flights. The parking situation is potentially costly.  Avoid higher fees by obtaining an inclusive rate for parking when you book your reservation.  If staying overnight just before your morning flight, try returning your rental car the night before to avoid a costly parking charge.;4
The rooms were clean and the beds were so comfortable! The staff was friendly, helpful and welcoming. It is very  close to LAX and they have shuttles to and from the airport every 10 to 15 minutes. They offer park and fly packages at very affordable prices.;5
I have been staying here for years, it's a very nice hotel. Sometimes, you get to see some really oddball people having a convention/meeting there, which just adds to the people-watching fun. Nice pool outdoors, great bar, good food in the restaurant. Room service is exceptionally fast. Rooms are nice and large, comfortable, not noisy as some airport hotels are. Staff is one of the best, the front desk folks always make me feel welcome.  Some of the rooms have outdoor access, in other words you take the elevator up but go outside to get into your room. If this aspect bothers you, request an interior access room. I am a starpoints gold member so I usually always get the club member floor rooms. Just a thought for those of you who may not like outdoor access.  Plenty of soap,;5
Location is very close to departure terminals and just next to all car return locations. Hertz car return was only 2 blocks away. Hertz shuttle driver dropped me off at the hotel even though it was one block off his regular route since it was late at night. The hotel is typical Four Points and the service was good.;4
We were suprised that we liked this hotel so much, we had only chosen it as it was close to the airport for our return flight. The bar was terrific, the room great and it had the best shower of the whole holiday, and on top of that, it was very reasonable! Good ending to our trip.;4
On three different attempts to address the temperature in the room (it was at 64 degrees) they said there was nothing they could do about it and I was so cold in the room I had to use the hair dryer to warm up the bed and my feet! The attitude at the front desk was very poor in dealing with this situation. A decent hotel would at least offer a small heater to help.;3
Ok this is a Sheraton hotel, so expect an extremely comfortable bed, nice bathroom and quality details... all these things once you are inside your bedroom... Unfortunately the corridors where dark and with a strange smell. We stayed there for one night only as we had a very early morning flight the next day. As usual the breakfast is not included. The shuttle from and to the airport works every 15 minutes. I would recommend this hotel, especially for travelers.;3
The Good:  Located right off Century Blvd., very close to airport.  From touchdown to hotel took me 30 minutes, with checked bags.  Room 651 had two beds and faced out onto hallway with windows to outside back of building and parking lot.  Clean room.  Free wifi.  Room had pull down shade behind sheer curtains which kept the room very private.  Good customer service.  Wake up call as requested.  The bad: Burger in bar high priced so I went across the street to Burger King for food.  Two shuttles went by as I was exiting the lobby, the second without stopping to look for passengers and I had to wait 20 minutes for next shuttle.  Male driver to hotel not anxious to help with bags.  Female driver on return very helpful.  TV in room got fuzzy above channel 22.  If you found this;4
I stayed here one night and would rate this as one of my least favorite Starwood properties.  I booked a Deluxe room through spg.com, but when I entered it, I found the room to be very dated, grungy, with worn and stained carpeting, old TV, '80s-era bathroom, etc.  I promptly called the front desk (which was inadequately staffed, by the way) and found out I was inexplicably given a Traditional room.  I went down to the front desk to ask for the room that I had reserved.  No explanation or apology was given, but I was re-assigned to a Deluxe room.  This room was more modern and comfortable, but it was very small and still somewhat dirty (the carpeting was sticky) and very noisy.  Doors slammed shut throughout the night.  Check out was without any pleasantries or graciousness.  In;2
Food:  breakfast boasts a full buffet from scramble eggs, hot oatmeal, fruits to cold cereal and milk.  One can also order off the breakfast menu.  During my week long stay, I ate on site over ten meals.  Lunch and dinner foods are consistent.  What stood out to me is the restaurant service staff:  Patty, Jesus, James, Maria (mgr), Mario ... worked very well as a team together.  Their acommodating, friendly service kept me coming back daily.    Hotel room:  3-star.  You can what you pay for.  I didn't pay much, so I didnt' get much, nor should I have expected much.  What you do get is a clean room w/ comfortable bed & linen, professional daily house-keeping, a functioning bathroom with all the clean hotel towels one wants.  Also free daily in room H2O.    Acommodation:  a clean,;4
I have never stayed at a Sheraton that disgusted me so much.  The pillows on the bed were dirty and had yellowish stains on them. The blankets above the sheets had holes in them.  My wife and I had to strip the bed down to the sheet.  The sheet was the only item that looked like it had been washed.  It felt like we were staying at a Motel 6.  Very disappointed that Sheraton would lower their standards to this level.;2
Had one night stay excellent rate $80 with breakfast included but parking was around $19. Free WIFI and right across from budget car rental and free airport shuttle very convenient. Front desk agent who was exceptionally courteous and very professional her name was Edith. If you got her at the desk she will make your stay even better.;4
We had an early flight out of LAX and stayed here the night before. Very convenient, walking distance to many rental agencies and with a hotel shuttle to the airport in the morning. The hotel was not high class - had paper cups instead of glasses in the room, for example, but was an economical choice. We enjoyed the bar - not fancy, but 100 beer choices and good apps.;4
I was coming back after visiting family in the LA area and needed a hotel that was close to the airport and rental agencies. I was tired and the hotel staff was very helpful and welcoming. When I got to my room I had all that I needed for a comfortable and restful night.;4
Stayed twice at Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport.   Staff were friendly helpful and welcoming . So easy and convenient with free airport shuttle included, laundry /resturant / ATM on site, free Wi Fi internet,gym, pool on site.   Really great base to expore LA from using many options eg local bus centre ($1.50 bus fare all way to downtown or $5.00 day pass) , taxi , Hotel Ocean Express Trolley (only $5.00 ) ,tour pick up from hotel.;5
I have just returned from my 3rd and probably final stay at the Four Points Los Angeles Airport. I travel via Los Angeles on trips to Australia and New Zealand and have stayed at several of the airport hotels. The price is definitely right at the Four Points and the proximity to the airport is great but the hotel seemed tired in 2008 when I stayed here the first time and in 2012, it's even more tired and more in need of renovations than it was 4 years ago. Old furnishings, old bathroom, dirty sheets and carpeting, it's really time for a major overhaul.   The staff were perfectly helpful and courteous and most major car rental companies are within walking distance.;2
I stayed at this property for 1 night. The service was great from check in to the bars and restaurant as well as the tour desk. I was alone and felt very safe and comfortable in this hotel. My only complaint was my room was very noisey from other rooms and the window faced a hallway. Considering I only paid $99.00 plus taxes this was acceptable for 1 night. Very Good Hotel and would stay again as a stopover in LA.;4
I encountered employees who are detailed in their work, understand service quality and were very kind and interpersonal.  Mr. Victor Hernandez works in the lounge / bar of the hotel.  He took great care in recommending a nice red wine after asking asking me about my taste preference.  The wine was perfect, than he recommended the chicken skewers and that was delicious.  Finally when the dessert was way too much for me, he took care of my sweet tooth by offering me a complimentary hotel cookie.  It was delicious filled with mac nuts and chocolate... really made it a nice simple evening.  Today Jesus Gutierez in the lounged served my husband and I lunch and again was kind and personable.  The food was excellent and service good.  This is a special place with good employees.  BTW;4
"We had an early morning flight from LAX and stayed here for one night.  We were greeted at the front desk by Edgar Sosa who did an excellent job of finding us the type of room we were looking for: recently renovated and in the tower with a window that faced outside.  Just be aware: there are rooms that have windows that face a hallway rather than outside.  A rather bizarre set-up that we happily avoided because we checked reviews on Tripadvisor.  Our room was quite spacious and neatly furnished with all the essentials.  I liked the simple, sparkling white bathroom with good lighting.  There wasn't a real ""view"" from the window but I didn't expect that.  There was plenty of light and it was remarkably quiet for being so close to an airport. We also thought the shuttle was quite";4
I still I will stay there, but I needed to do my check in early and was very well attended. I will write more when i do the check out.;5
I was at this hotel for a business meeting for just one night. Unfortunately I managed to trip and fall on the way into building. At least four staff members were immediately at my side to make sure I was ok.  They got my car parked, me checked in, ice for my knee, and me to my room swiftly.  All demonstrated above and beyond courtesy and respect.  Room service was prompt.  The staff throughout my stay were among the friendliest I''ve experienced at any hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable. I would stay here again. Thanks staff for worrying about my needs.;5
I stayed here for one night for a layover. If I had to stay any longer I would have moved on. The place is pretty old and well overdue for a major makeover or wrecking ball. Staff were OK but pretty hard to find when you wanted them. There is a free shuttle to & from LAX that does the rounds of the hotels in the area. The area around the hotel looked a little dodgy so I took a cab to and from Culver City for a spot of shopping;2
I stopped in the bar for a few drinks at noon and the atmosphere was calm and clean. the bartendress was more than helpful with my drink selection :) prompt and courteous, coming back real soon.;4
My son couldn't get change from the front desk, your store is 2 high, 2 round it off $5 4 a ice cream. They took out the soda machine and don't say anything. This trip was not a gd 1, then they try 2 change me 4 parking I didn't even uses.;2
I will start with the good-the staff was all very friendly and polite.  No one was too busy to answer a question, and even went way beyond expectation answering my endless amounts of questions on what to do in the area and how to get there.  I also think the value is good.  Here is where I had problems.  Upon checking in at 11pm, I had to wait a bit because my room apparently had not been cleaned.  Actually it had been, and was not that big of a problem other than the fact that I had been driving for hours and was dead tired.  The hotel did comp me one night of parking for this.  The shower drain did not drain.....at least not very fast.  By the time you were done showering, your feet were covered in water which is kinda gross.  I mentioned to housekeeping, but never followed;3
Great room- seemed VERY large after being on cruise ship. We faced the street which is maybe noisy for some but we liked it. We saw the presidents helicopters fly from the airport :-) Restaurant wasn't very good. I had a salad which was lovely but my husbands meal was cold and not so good We prepaid so rate was low 94. If it had been sunny there is a lovely pool and pool area They have free shuttle to airport. I REALLY like the 24 hour check-in We would definitely stay again;4
This hotel is part of a chain, so the service is pretty standard. nothing more to expect. The service was good, room was clean and it was inexpansive so nothing to complain about.;3
poor service, distracted and inattentive front desk;2
Nice hotel for the price. I was driving from Vegas to Cali for a quick weekend trip and with gas prices going up I wanted something reasonable. $79.00 per night with taxes total was $90.82 for one night. I stayed in the traditional two Queens room which was quite spacious. Clean room & bathroom. I was missing coffee cups went to the front desk to let them know and they took care of it right away. Didn't eat at the restaurant on the premises as with most hotels it was a little pricey. Went around the corner to Denny's. For what I would have paid for a bottle of beer from the restaurant got a 6 pack from a 711 around the corner for $1.49 more. Parking was $20.00 but the next morning when I got up a little piece of paper under my door $0.00 for parking, nice!;4
"We made a last-minute reservation with the Sheraton Four Points LAX due to our mother being taken to the hospital...and subsequently being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  We booked a block of three rooms for family members who were taking turns holding round-the-clock vigil by my mother's side.  The entire staff witnessed 10+ family members going in and out...exhausted...crying...and at the hotel just long enough for the 2-hour-sleep shifts we scheduled.  This went on for 7 long days/nights until out Mother passed away.  In my 10+ years of being a frequent traveler...AND staying at every major hotel chain...I have never experienced the kindness and accommodation offered to us by everyone we encountered at this Starwood hotel.

"I was on R&R and was on my last week of leave and decide to visit Los Angeles, after a week stay in Hawaii to finish out my leave and return to Afghanistan. I checked with the LAX USO about Hotels in the immediate area and was told about Four Points. A call was made and the manager on at that time said, ""Yes, have we rooms and Yes, we do honor military!  So I immediately  selected Four Point Hotel by Sheraton,  however when I initially showed up to check in, there seemed to be some confusion at the front desk. The manager, Adam was not there, but once word got to him, he quickly resolved the matter! From that moment on, service was excellent. I inquiried about  golf courses and the consi went about searching for various course, but he took the time and the crew which one";5
The shuttle was fast to pick us at the airport. We had a fast check in, we got a newly remodeled room. very practical airport hotel, good size room, super big bathroom. No noise from airplanes, incredible experience.;5
The 4 Points may not be the newest or poshest, but they offer nice rooms, great service, and excellent value.  I always stay here when I fly out of LAX and I have never been disappointed.;5
"My group and I stayed here on a weekend to attend the 43rd Annual NAACP Image Awards. The hotel accommodated our ""early check-in"" request and a few of our other needs. We sat in the lobby one afternoon just because and it was comfortable: a nice big flat screen, plenty of computers for public use, and enough room for everyone who wanted to sit down and relax. We'll stay here again next year!";5
This hotel is perfectly located if you want to be right by the airport and you rent a a car. The room was clean. My big problem is you have to pay $19 for parking. Alot of money to park your car. Also a free breakfast would have been nice. Great pool!;4
We recently stayed at this hotel  for a weekend.  We got a fantastic rate on the Starwood website and the hotel was better than expected.    The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Parking is easy and was included in our hotel rate but I believe it's about $19 a night.  The room was comfortable -- nothing fancy and pretty basic.  I thought the bed was more  comfortable then the Westin Heavenly Bed.  There aren't many products in the bathroom - just the basics - shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The free WiFi worked well and was easy to use.  This hotel was definitely a nice surprise.;4
"I have stayed here before and use the park and fly packages. The rooms are OK. The last two times the airport shuttle kept us waiting at the airport longer than the 15 to 20 minutes promised, but we were assured that things would improve.  Last night was unacceptable,   We waited 35 minutes at the airport for the shuttle, then another 25!! minutes to exit the parking area with a pre-paid ""comp"" ticket.    Adding almost an hour on to the homeward trip is not OK.";1
First of all, they have some of the most reasonable rates for a high quality room near LAX. Frequent shuttles. And the staff was exceptional, from the drivers, customer service people (LOL, they actually know what that means, it's not just a job title they gave someone) to the desk clerks, all couldn't be more pleasant & helpful. Even a better than average free gym. Bob Santa Fe NM;5
"The rooms are clean, but stuff is dingy and it has a crappy feel about it. There is an Embassy Suites across the street, much nicer but this place is CHEAP. I mean 3000 SPG points or about $80 a night or less cheap. Cheap. Things are stained, dingy and old - but clean. Don't expect anything extra for SPG Preferred status, there is no club floor, special perks, upgrades, nothing. Windows overlook industrial buildings, everything is ugly and planes fly overhead constantly but then again this is an airport hotel. Parking is sometimes included in rate which is good and lot looks secure and safe. I do recommend though if you need an airport hotel just to crash because of the cheapness and location but don't expect much. As I will mention in every review from now on, no ""holds"" were";3
Nice rooms. Good bed. Expensive car park. Starbucks in the hotel. Expensive WiFi. Overall good and convenient as always.;4
The rooms are clean, but everything from the hallway carpet to the furniture was stained, dingy, and old. The food is great and the service is ok. Stay here if you find a good bargain.;3
Hotel was full so there were no upgrades available  (even for the Starwood Diamond guests). Staff were wonderful especially Martin.;5
Usually stay at the Westin LAX but last couple of times had problems there so decided this time to try Four Points -  Same area as Westin, and let me tell you I will stay again.  Check in was a breeze - my online rate included parking and that was a nice inclusion since it was like $20 at the Westin. Rate also included FREE WiFi which at the Westin was also $14 or so.  Room was clean, quiet and totally fine!!  I'm fairly hard to please but I was very pleased here.;4
I arrived very late and was just staying there because of an early flight the next morning.  Check in was efficient and polite.  I get to the floor for my room and see that the windows of the rooms are in the hallway like an enclosed Motel 6.  Odd.  My room had an old smell and I could tell that they had tried to refresh a room from a very, very long time ago.  The linens were clean but the blanket had long ago seen better days - small holes.  I did go back downstairs with the hope of getting a snack for the morning.  The gift shop isn't open past 10 so unlike at a Courtyard where it is 24 hours, I was out of luck.  In the morning, right before I got in the shower I realized there was no hair dryer in the room.  I called to ask if I just didn't know where to look, but there just;2
...unless you're ok with not being able to control  your own room's temperature.  The beds were comfy, the room (facing away from the street) was quiet, and the front desk staff were very accommodating.  This is a good thing because at 3:30 a.m. I had to go down to front desk to complain about the heat in my room.  Turns out the center tower rooms are on central heat in the winter (and, I guess, central air in the summer) so by turning on what I thought was the a/c in our room, I actually made the blowers work harder.  It was 84 degrees! The front desk guy quickly found us another room, in another wing, also quiet with comfy beds.  The location next to LAX is great, and the complimentary shuttle trip to the airport is terrific.  I called and with AAA card got a better deal than;4
"I didn't actually stay at this property as my company put me up down the street at another hotel. I walked over for the express purpose of finding good beer. They did not disappoint. Brewsters has a large selection of bottled beer and at least six taps. I was told the taps rotate regularly but Old Rasputin is always in the house. I believe prices were in line with the LAX area.  Christina, the bartender was especially knowledgeable about craft beer and her customer service was top notch. She helped introduce my coworker to the world of beer beyond the typical light lager from the ballpark. I also had a chance to talk with the bar manager and it was good to see someone genuinely interested in craft beers in charge.   As the former governor would say,  ""I'll be back.""";5
2nd stay at 4Points Sheraton near LAX.  Have to stay in LAX for my layover and the hotel has been great for dog friendly staying.  Rooms are super clean,  beds are very comfortable and rooms service is reasonably priced and very good.  I have stayed at the Westin with my dog and this is just as nice and not as pretentious.  GREAT VALUE;4
The rooms were clean, but everything from the hallway carpet to the furniture was stained, dingy, and old.   Not gross-yet.   Stay here if you get a great rate.  The location is very good.;3
I ended up at this hotel for a two day trip to L.A. After a monster of a day I was so relieved to be greeted by a warm and friendly staff, I gave them a call to see about checking in early and they had no problem with that. The room was average size, bed was comfy, bathroom had good counter space and the housekeeper gave me as much coffee as I wanted without hesitation. The room was wonderful, it reminded me of a much cheaper and scaled down version of the W.;5
"We usually go out to breakfast, but decided to eat at the hotel to save time.  We had the BEST waiter ever!  HIs name is Jesus Gutierez.   He was polite, friendly, exetremely professional and treated us very well. The other waitresses didn't really look at us, when we ate there before, not friendly. But JESUS is the best!  I left a pair of reading glasses in my room, called within a hour of leaving and they said they didn't find them. I have followed up several times, the last time while I was staying at the hotel again.  The head of housekeeping told me that they throw away anything left in the rooms, no matter what it is.  I have never heard of a hotel not keeping a ""Lost & Found"".    Very dissappointing.";4
This hotel was the least expensive offered by Southwest Airlines as a follow-on to my LA ticket purchase and I chose it strictly because it was close to the airport AND $79 + taxes. Couldn't find any other airport hotel near that price. It's a great place to stay. Courteous, friendly, helpful staff. Free Wifi in the room. Comfy beds. The food in the restaurant is excellent —yummy fish tacos. It is close to a city bus stop center and I have visited both Getty Museums via public transportation. No complaints. Well, one small one . . .NO PBS STATION on their TVs. I've never had the problem before of no public broadcasting so I missed Downton Abbey and the new Sherlock Holmes. TSK, TSK 4 Points Sheraton LAX!;4
The staff was very helpful during check in and upon discovering the room i first checked in had a maintenance issue ! I was issued another room immediately ! I do appreciate the promptness and care involved in that particular situation ! The hotel is clean,staff is pleasant, I noticed more hotel security  than I've seen usually !  Was a busy weekend was glad to see there presence ! But my major issue with the establishment is hotel staff passing the buck ! Im a frequent traveler and the world over have never had a problem with advanced payment ! Some people can't rest until there responsibilities or obligations have been met ! Each Person i spoke with at the front desk including the hotel asst manager refused my payment until check out ! That is very bothersome knowing I've done;3
"The staff was really great; especially at check-in, Julian Brito served us and it was more than perfect and far from what we expected comming from the Westin in downtown Los Angeles.";5
I've stayed here about 6 times now.  I live 2 hours from LAX so when I fly out of LAX sometimes staying overnight the night before makes sense.  I'm a very loyal Starwood customer so sometimes you have to put up with the not so great hotels to keep your status.  Anyway, my issue with this hotel is that I don't feel very safe there.  The parking area is very dark.  You can valet, but the valet service is pretty hit or miss because most people don't valet at this hotel.  I've checked in when there was nobody available to park my car so I had to go to the scary dark parking lot.  Also, they don't secure the elevators in the hotel and I've ridden the elevator with some scary individuals that might not have even been hotel guests.  I just get the willies when I get off on my floor;3
I  traveled from the east coast with my wife and sister and we spent 2 days in the L.A. area.  The second night we spent at this hotel since it was close to the airport and we were flying off to Hawaii the next morning.  We booked 2 rooms and both were ready upon our arrival and right next to each other.  Rooms were clean and the wireless connection worked with no trouble.  We felt safe and secure in this hotel and got a good nights sleep.  We spent an hour or so at the bar on the first level and quenched our thirst and had some bar food that was just adequate.  The following morning we caught the free shuttle to the airport.  The shuttle runs every 15 minutes or so.  We had to wait less than 10 minutes and although crowded we were at the airport 10 minutes later.  Our driver;4
Good airport hotel, very good value for money at that price bracket. Reception was charming friendly and efficient, good airport shuttle service. Room was very clean and quiet. Bed comfortable. We were in the old wing which has rooms off an enclosed corridor, room seemed to be recently updated, comfortable bed, minimalist in terms of provisions, good accommodation for slightly over $100 a night.;4
We needed an overnight lodging somewhere near LAX airport that was clean and relatively comfortable and that's exactly what we got. The free shuttle to and from the airport is a thoughtful detail. The checkout receptionists work to make in-and-out checking as smoothly as possible. Our room was not too big or too small and the window by the bed was directly on the outdoor hallway, but it didn't bother us. (They could have had more coffee and tea bags by the water heater, there was only one of each.) We would have liked to have a better choice of food options for dinner, considering how big the hotel is. We decided to forego the limited menu of the restaurant and just have something to eat in the sports bar, which only got louder - with the clientele - just when we were finishing;3
This hotel spent all of its money on the lobby.  The actual room is full of minor irritations: whining fluorescents, stained chairs and carpet, grout issues in the bathroom, etc.  It's also kind of a nickel-and-dime stay.  Local calls cost $1.50.  Parking (maybe?) costs something according to their in-room info, but the lady at reception didn't actually mention a price.  If you're using the meeting facilties, the hotel is quite nice.  If you're planning to stay, it's similar to a motel 6.;2
I stayed here for 3 nights and was impressed by the hotel in almost every aspect. The check in was simple, the rooms were clean as was the entire hotel and the Brewsters bar was outstanding. It is perfect for LAX access and only 15 minutes by cab to Venice. Also the cost of the room was almost 50% less than other hotels of similar stature and having stayed at other hotels nearby, i would definitely stay here again.;4
I'm a Ventura County resident who travels via LAX frequently.  Instead of the bleary eyed 3 a.m. shuttle ride or a stressful 5 am drive, I stayed at 4-Points the night before.  Great value, my room was very clean, quiet and comfortable, great friendly staff.  Best thing, a  terrific dinner at Brewsters (the fish taco's - with a Sierra Nevada Porter....yum!!!!!), a good night's sleep and off to LAX with no stress in the morning!  Thanks 4-Points.;5
We checked in late at night, approximately 11 pm.  The front desk was efficient and pleasant.  We went to our room to find that the maid took her break in the middle of cleaning the room so we could not move in.  The vacuum cleaner was parked in the middle of the room.  We hung around for about 20 minutes at which point the maid came in and did a cursory run over with the vacuum. The next morning my husband had a shower without a problem but when I immediately followed him there was no hot water.  Even I can't blame him for using all the hot water for an entire hotel.;2
The hotel was ok with a small room yet quite clean. The location was very good and great for short staying tourists. But the hotel was quite clean and the breakfast was good. The staff was good and helpful. Overall a good stay.;3
The staff always remembers me upon my return and is always friendly and willing to help, and with a smile.... even when I am tired upon returning from an Internatinal trip! Since the renovation, this hotel is the perfect place to stay near LAX.;4
Close to LAX, clean but the hotel is very tired and is in dire need of a refurb. The housekeeping staff did a great job trying to keep the place feeling clean, but the whole place needs to be redone. The shuttle to/from LAX is not every 15 minuted as advertised. I waited at the assigned pickup location 75 minutes and had to make 3 calls before it arrived. when going back to LAX it took 50 minutes. The Confort Food resturant was lacking in service, however the portions were tasty and more than ample;2
I try to stay near the airport when I am leaving early.  The LAX Four Points is right across the road from the Budget car rental place.  So that made it easy to drop the car off the night before the flight and walk across the street.  Needful things: 1. Quiet - YES 2. Easy check in - YES 3. Comfortable bed - YES 4. Clean room -YES 5. Frequent shuttle to the airport -YES 6. Good price -YES  Enough said.;5
Rooms are nice.  Food is great.  Close to airport.;5
Slept here for a few hours on my way to LAX. Lobby area was very nice and staff was helpful. I stayed on the second floor. The hallway carpeting on the second floor was the worst I have ever seen in a hotel. The room was large but needed updating.;3
I loved to stay there. Great service at front desk in special Mr. Edgar Sosa. Your service makes all the difference!;5
This Four Points by Sheraton is everything that a good business/ airport hotel should be.  It has convenient and free parking (my overnight parking was free with validation- I see other comments to the contrary here, so double-check this before booking), check-in is quick and efficient, rooms are neat and tidy, beds are comfortable, wireless internet is available.  The hotel was completely quiet at night and I had a very restful sleep.  I was here just one night after a business trip to L.A. and was completely satisfied with my experience.  I have stayed in other Four Points properties that were less than stellar, but this is a pretty nice one.  I used Starwood points to pay for my room, so there was no charge.  However, when researching options for a quick overnight in L.A.,;4
I stayed for 3 nights, and had consistently friendly and helpful service at the front desk - upon check-in, as well as with a question I had throughout the weekend.  Patti, who works breakfast in the larger restaurant and lunch in the bar/restaurant is TOP NOTCH.  I stayed here in July and she remembered me when I returned in October, and again in January!  Her smiling face and service was a high point of the experience!  My room each time was as expected - clean, ready, basic amenities.  LOVE the complimentary water!!  What a nice touch!;4
Just had a wonderful experience when relaxing in the lobby of this hotel.  A very professional and kind bartender named, Chistina was working this past, Jan. 30th and she made my time there very enjoyable.  She offered good dining advice and the wait staff that was there with her at the time was equally as helpful and friendly.;5
Really enjoy this hotel. The only downside is the $19/day parking fee. Also, did not have coffee for the coffeemaker in the room. The rate of $99/day was great!;4
"wow.   checked in at 4pm and sent to 7th floor and room was not cleaned yet.  went back to front desk.  sent to 6th floor and key would not open the door.  back to front desk.  sent to 5th floor and room was ok.  very dirty windows.  ok room although told it was a ""renovated"" floor for gold card holders/preferred starwood guests.  disappointing.    front desk help was apologetic and gave us a free breakfast voucher. but it was an over-all hassle. not sure i would stay here again.    robert westwood";3
"Stayed here January 2012 for 1 night. Have been here before, and always have a good stay. Everyone is welcoming and friendly. Property is being updated, room by room. West tower is complete, rooms are nice. I had a corner room, there is so much extra space, almost felt guilty wasting it. Bathroom is small (ish), but laid out well. Did notice there were a couple smudges on the fixtures, like glue or something from when they were put in.   1 very tiny wrinkle-showed up early and asked if there was a room ready. Was told there were no king bed rooms-I said that was fine, I didn't care. Then was told there were no rooms in teh West wing, only East Tower. Again, said I didn't care and that was fine. Then was told they only had 1 room, and had to keep it for their ""overnight";4
"I have stayed at the Four Points more times than I can even remember.  I'm happy to see small improvements every visit.  My favorite bartender/waiter Victor Hernandez takes great care of me.  One suggestion on parking;  The small lot next to the gate should be reserved for Starwood Guest, would be a nice little perk.";4
Having heard (on Flyertalk) & read about all the improvements that have been made at this hotel recently, I decided to give it a try for a one-night layover.  The lobby & restaurant areas have had major renovations, especially the restaurant-couldn't believe the difference in there!  Unfortunately, there is still no place to park the car during check-in & bell stand refused to take my bags, so I could go return the rental car, because one of the bags was a computer bag.  Staff seemed to think rooms 'next to each other' is the same as 'connecting', which we had specifically requested at the time of booking, leading to a room change after arrival.  Beds are still comfortable, but be sure to ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid street noise.  This hotel shares an airport;3
Stayed in the hotel for a week during a working trip to L.A. The hotel is less than 10 min drive from LAX via airport shuttle bus. Loved the deluxe room - clean and well equipped (LED TV, study table, refrigerator, coffee maker, hi-speed wifi). The bed was  comfortable. The hotel also have amenties such as gym, swimming pool, gift shop, restaurant and bar at the ground level. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. There are a good selection of tours in L.A. which you can booked from VIP Tour with the hotel concierge. The tour bus will pick and drop you off at the hotel lobby.;4
When ever I come to the LAX area my favourite place to stay is the Four Points by Sheraton LAX.  They have been renovating there for the past year or so.  The rooms are clean, properly supplied, free internet, a desk to work at, great beds, a pool, coffee corner at the desk, great little bar with well priced delicious food, dining room with a good variety, free shuttles, very good meeting facilities and I love the staff.  The value for what I pay is tops for me and all my friends.   I have stayed in many hotels around the world, so I know what I am talking about.  I love sharing and helping people!;5
Price was very reasonable but the room, halls, elevators were in terrible shape. The carpet in the hallways is coming apart at the seams. The bathrooms walls were cracked. The shelves are all peeling. I also have a problem with $20 per night parking. I will pay a little more and get a newer, updated room next time.;2
My experience from my one night stay at this hotel has prevented me from booking ANY Sheraton hotels since! We stayed here less than a year ago, and I feel bad for not writing this review sooner. The details mentioned in this review may vary by a little bit since I don't remember them exactly.   --ABOUT THE SERVICE--  We booked this hotel for one night because I had an important job interview to go to in West Hollywood and this hotel was at a convenient location. The price it offered was very reasonable (I think just over $100). We booked this for the night before my interview so we could have a restful sleep there before I had to go.  Now, my entire trip started off really bad. Preparing for the interview took much longer than I expected. By the time we finally left, we were 10;2
Had a nice stay here. I would not say that it is anything special. Positives. They do the basics just fine cleanliness and comfort. The location was handy to LAX so makes for a good place to base yourself if you do not want to battle traffic to get to the airport. Budget is also across the street so if you rent with them it will be a piece of cake to return your car and get to the airport. As my title mentioned I was surprised that it wasn't too noisy. I could still hear the airplanes but not enough to warrant lack of sleep which is especially impressive given that I am a light sleeper. It was also joined to the room next door with a door separating us but again not much noise as coming through. There is plenty of parking so no need to worry about that though the parking spaces;4
The location was very convenient.  Had appetizers in the bar on the first night - delicious.  Outside seating area is beautiful for eating, meeting or relaxing with a beautiful view of the golf course.  The restaurant was good for both breakfast and dinner and also used one of the conference rooms.  The room was comfortable and well appointed.  Though I could see planes landing at LAX - I did not hear an airplane - good sound insulation.;5
Stayed 1night at this hotel. The price was right, but the food here is expensive. For the price of their cheeseburger & fries, I could of saved money and walked across the street to Burger King. Other than that, I chose hotel due to free shuttle to airport. I might stay again.;3
The title really summarizes our stay.  Marcos Garcia professional & friendly demeanor at the resturant made the dinner more enjoyable!;4
I got stuck here due to a flight delay and was happy about it because the hotel and staff were so nice!  Not a huge selection for food but what was on offer was really good.  Very close to LAX-perfect for a stopover.;5
I stayed for two nights 1/20/2012 to 1/22/2012.  I had never stayed in a Four Points before, even though I have stayed at many Sheratons before.The hotel FAR exceeded my expectations! On arrival at LAX, their free shuttle brought me to the very modern and upscale property. Check in was easy. The room was very modern, with a feature that all business travelers will appreciate...tons of electrical outlets to recharge all the gadgets! The furnishings were very nice, with energy efficient bulbs in all the lamps. The bathroom is very modern too, with great water pressure ( I have stayed at many hotels that you are lucky to get a trickle from the shower). Guess what...the room windows actually open. A feature that I love. Nice comfy bed too. As for the lobby, a great place to hang;5
Wow--I have stayed in the airport area many times.  Ended up going with this property due to a great price.  Everyone (I mean everyone) was very friendly and polite, from the desk staff to the shuttle staff to the concierge. I asked about restaurants in the area--only hotel-type restaurants.  I started at Brewsters--wow, 110 beers! Chicken wings were the 2nd hottest I have had (made me cry--in a good way).  Victor Hernandez provided really good service at the bar.  I went to another hotel restaurant for dinner--it was just OK.  I came back to Brewsters and Victor remembered me.  He has a really good manner and treated all guests as special.  I will come back here when I am in the area.;5
We layover in LAX at least twice a year when heading in / out of Asia. We have stayed at a variety of hotel around LAX but find FourPoints the most consistent. Juan at the front desk is very helpful. Muskee (not sure of the spelling) always takes care of our numerous (and heavy) bags. Only downside is getting dinged for parking!;4
If you need a hotel that's close to the airport then this is perfect. They have a free shuttle to and from the airport and the rooms are nice. Are room did smell a bit funny(strong body odour smell) but we only stayed for 1 night so didn't really matter. Not much food within sort walking distance besides burger king.;4
This was my 1st visit to LA and I will certainly return. The hotel is a quite large but every one I encountered (front desk, concierge, house keeping, parking attendant)  made me feel very welcome. I arrived very early @ 11A and the concierge held my luggage while I wondered around LA looking for something to eat. When I returned @ 2P my King size bed was not ready so he placed me in a double queen ( I was still early for check in @ 3P. I was worn out from flying so early in the AM and at this point and didn't care where I slept lol). The room was fantastic with the double queen beds. It was very large with huge windows. The decor was HOTEL NICE. The both beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows. I especially liked the two large pillows to prop up and sit up in bed. I;4
Customer service at the front desk was amazing!!!  Room seemed perfect for the occasion. But I left with multiple bedbug bites!!!;3
Stayed here for 4 days in 2010 for. Great Room. Parking a little expensive though. Central to everything airport, Downtown LA. Would Defintately stay here again....;4
My daughter and I stayed 5 nights at the Four Point Sheraton LAX.  The best part was the wonderful staff.  We are from Minnesota and were out there visiting a college and had no clue about how to get around and see things.  We asked at the Consierge and we didn't have any problems after that!  We got to the beach and shopping malls and made it to the school which was an hour away.  We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and met a wonderful waiter named Jesus and he was what you would think Jesus would really be like!  Muisie and Jess at the Consierge desk also could not have been more helpful. I am so glad I found this place!  When I got back to Minnesota and to work I let everyone know how great it was and a friend is planning on staying at the Four Points on vacation!;5
Stayed one week at the LAX Sheraton 4 Points.  It's an old hotel with nicely updated room fixtures and bedding.  The service was good with the only problem being one night the tub backed up with dirty water.  As a preferred guest was put on the 2nd floor that was noisy one night.  If you can get a good online deal, you'll enjoy the stay.   If the price was the same as the LAX Sheraton Gateway, the Gateway preferred guest perks are better.;4
Just spent a few days at the 4 Points Sheraton last week. I paid less than the norm using Priceline and was given a room with black stains on the walls, floor and sheets. The lampshade was bashed in. It was really awful.  When I let the front desk know that the room was unsatisfactory I was given a room in the other tower that was in much better condition. The bar has a great selection and the bartender was great. The guest services employees tried to be helpful, but after 10 minutes of waiting I had to to go into the mailroom with them to help them locate a parcel that was in plain view.  The stay turned out o.k., but I have to question any hotel that would try to stick someone with the dirty, run-down room that I was offered when I first arrived.;2
"I booked hotel based on the review and payed premium for the ""deluxe King"". I am a Starwood preferred guest. I walked to my room and it was nothing but deluxe in an old motel style wing that is so noisy as the window is facing a corridor with bad noise insulation. Also, the room was a 2 queen room that was listed for $10 less. I called the service desk and I was told ""no problem, we have a king in the east wing that is quiet."" I walked down to the lobby and the receptionist did not know what I was talking about so I had to repeat my request: A quiet king room. The receptionist gave me a new key and I confirmed that it was a quiet King room.  Guess what? I just walked into the new room and What I got is a 2 queen room that is right next to a gigantic AC unit on the roof that is";3
We booked this hotel, as their website at the time,left us with the impression that they had a complimentary late check out. Upon check in we found out complimentary means $40 extra. Begrudgingly, I payed up the extra cash, too late to change our plans at that stage. The shuttle bus from the airport was fast and efficient, the meal at at the bar area was good, the newly refurbished room was excellent, although when doing the major renovations,I am amazed they didn't do something with the elevators! Only 1 of the 3 elevators seemed to be working and it gave you a wild ride, bouncing up and down several times before coming to a stop at the lobby. It was so crazy it became a joke with anyone you rode the elevator with! The concierge staff were more than helpful and the public;4
Great hotel for great price and we loved that it was pet friendly.;5
"This hotel has combined it's old perks with many new ones!!  When you fly into LAX you can still take the hotel shuttle directly to the hotel or you can ride the Budget Rent-A-Car shuttle to pick up your car and park it across the street - or you can just walk across the street and pick your car up the next morning when you aren't so tired and save on the the rental time.  Location - Location - Location!  The recently remodeled rooms, restaurant and pub are a genuine treat and are laid out for comfort.  The staff are always extremely customer oriented; so much so that I look forward to seeing them.  Their prices are ""very"" competitive and include prices/options that you or your family will love.  The Four Points LAX is the model other hotels should strive for.";5
This is the best hotel around LAX for any kind of trip, we have used their facilities many times specially when you travel overseas, for many days, their parking policy is the best in the area Last December we fly down under for 20 days, our car was well taking care for. Dinning very good, rooms clean and ample......;5
This hotel is very convenient for anyone who wants to catch a flight from LAX. It is located only a mile from the airport . Extremely friendly staff, clean rooms, convenient parking and a great place to eat. The price is very reasonable compare to other motels in that area. Overall me and my family was very satisfied. Than you Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles Airport. We will recommend this hotel to anyone. You will enjoy this hotel.;5
There have been multiple hotel chains that have taken smaller version of brand to cater to the average traveler.  Sheraton has created Four Points and developed a model to be followed by evey other major chain.  LAX Four Points is the best overall value for the room rate by far.  remodeled room, plasma TV's, free Wifi and bottled water are just some perks. I love this property. Every property has room for improvement, but this proverty is the total package and a must stay.;4
For the price it was great, Room was clean. Everything was great except the $19 car parking fee. I  did not like that, however it seem like i didnt have a choice because most decent price hotel in the area also has parking fee. Overall was great. Would stay again. Very close to the airport very convinience.;5
I cannot say enough about the wonderful time we always have at the Four Points Sheraton, LAX.  We have been staying there for about 7 years now.  We arrive on Christmas night around 10 - enjoy a nice dinner in the restaurant or in Brewsters. If anyone is staying at this hotel you must try their soup - it is homemade and is the BEST.   The staff throughout the hotel is the BEST - I have never had any problem with anyone - the registration desk - they are so accommodating:  the concierge - whenever I needed any kind of information (church, movies, shopping, etc) they are right there with their maps guiding me.  And the restaurant and bar help - always a smile on their face - willing to make suggestions for meals, etc.Also the room help - if they are in the corridors there is;5
I've traveled cross country and found myself on here checking reviews in the past, I know it's a pain to decipher the good from the bad, so i'm going to make it simple. This place is amazing! Service is great, super comfy beds and despite being next to an airport I slept all night and the noise was minimal! That's the real plus.  I often think you can tell a lot about a place from the staff. Not to name names, (I'm about to) a girl named Melissa (she works at the front desk) really worked hard to help accommodate both our budgetary needs and both her and her supervisor Jealeasia were truly a beacon of good customer service. Both were friendly and very helpful.  Me and my Girlfriend had come here to spend the night of our anniversary and at first were a little skeptical as it is;5
I have stayed here several times and wanted to make sure that a great review came the way of the Four Points. The beds are comfortable, the pool is nice, and the gym is sufficient for any traveler in need of their daily routine. The food was good overall and Brewster's (sports bar) was great. It was the type of place to get a good meal, watch some sport games on the multiple flat screen TV's and relax. The service staff are always friendly especialy considering the type of clients that are rolling through each day. I see some reviews here that talk about the price of parking, the rooms being basic etc.  Okay this is LAX which means you are going to pay for your parking no matter where you stay in the area. My room was clean, nice and comfortable. Internet was also free which is;5
i booked this hotel through travelocity for one night right after christmas and got a good deal for 90 dollars including tax. was flying back to buffalo with wife and kid and needed something close the LAX and with a shuttle. i have been working in hotels for the last 7 years and was totally shocked to see how very nice looking on the inside this hotel was. the shuttle was perfect took only about 5 mins from hotel to airport. the room was 2 queen beds very clean and NO BED BUGS! believe me they can be in a any hotel. granted for the price the room was in a sectioin of the hotel that looked like it was once outside entrances and then closed in cause we had a big window looking into the hallway staring at a wall. but since i could careless about the view of other hotels across the;4
My husband and I visited Los Angeles for the weekend from Texas and we placed a reservation based on the location and the rate of this hotel. It was situated near LAX so the rate was a steal. When we arrived, check-in was painless and the room was very clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets had a strong smell of bleach, which I can overlook for the most part. There were a lot of dings and dents throughout the room but overall, it was a pleasant place to stay. You can hear the people in the next room through the shared door, but thank god they weren't roudy or rude. Other than that it was pretty quiet.   There was a situation with the elevators. We wanted to go eat and out of the three elevators that were there, only one worked at around 10pm, when there were;3
This is not my first time staying at this hotel.  I have been coming to this hotel since 1998 off and on.  I check in today December 24, 2011.  I went to my room it was freezing, call down stairs to front desk and the women at the desk was not very pleasant in conveying the information to me regarding the heat.    She convey no heat until 9pm for entire hotel, however it was very cold in my room, I felt as if I was outside and I told her that.  She said sorry, no heat until 9pm.  I was a bit upset and ask if they just started this procedure or was it in certain sections, she said no, the entire hotel.    I called back to to talk to the assistant manager and he didn't convey what the young women at the desk told me.  It was totally opposite.  I even asked her about a refrigerator;4
We stayed at the Four Points before we left to go back to Australia and the staff were so great!  When we got there we wanted to stay the night and the next day before leaving for the airport at 6pm - they managed to get us that even though there was a Glee Project thing going on and we were so thankful for that since we had reserved our room a month before :)  So great staff at the counter - I can't remember his name, but he has a 3 yr old son he told us about (as we had our kids there too) and he was so great!  The room was very clean and neat, only wish there was more coffee as hubby is a coffee drinker, so we had to order more since there is 1 pack of decaf and 1 caf - although it made about 2 of the travel cups so that helped.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the;4
Great hotel for the night before flying out of LAX.  We rent a budget car from Santa Barbara, drive up and check in to the hotel, husband drives across the street to drop of the car and walks back!  If we are only going for week or less, they have a park and stay rate that is great!  Hotel is clean and has a shuttle to the airport.;4
This hotel is clean, comfortable, and convenient with an exceptional beer selection! If you are a beer lover such as myself you will want to make this a stop when traveling through LAX! There is a huge rotation of brews from all over the world both on tap and in bottle hand picked by the staff. I did not experience the outside pool bar but I have been told that there is also a huge selection of tap beers available as well. I sat next to one of the local home brewers who meet there on a regular basis. The shuttle service works perfect running every 20 minutes around the clock and its proximity to the rental car makes it an easy walk back once you drop off your car. Be aware there is a parking fee for on site parking but this is not unusual for the area. I will be staying here;5
The room was ok  the bedding and towels smelled like bleach  the room never stayed the right temp it was hot or cold  and the room was not clean there was food left under the nightstand and a bottle cap would be nice if it was vacuumed  I was there for 2 days;2
I stayed at this hotel for one night as part of an airline holiday package and had a very basic budget rate room which had its window on a corridor. This corridor was not pleasant to walk down being somewhat dingy.  The room was small for the two king beds but was fine for just one night. The bed was comfy. The bathroom was clean although a little tired and had a few toiletries supplied but not a tooth brush which was what I needed. The shop down in the lobby area was open quite late and stocked toiletries.  This hotel has a resturant and bar but unfortunately these were closed before my 9pm arrival. I therefore phoned room service but they were unable to provide me with a simple sandwich so, as I could not eat from their menu, I had to wait for breakfast - not good after coming;3
As a person in the profession of hospital management, I have high expectations for customer service & the staff truly exceeded my expectations & made for a very pleasant start to my vacation.  I ate at the bar/restaurant and had excellent service & meal. I would definitely stay here again.;5
Staff was very friendly, professional and accommodating.  Their 24 Hour Check-In/Check-Out program was great for flying in and out of LAX and, especially when traveling with kids, this flexibility is a welcomed hospitality plus.  Great room service food, too.;5
I enjoyed the weather, the connivence, the friendly staff and the great beers available at Brewsters.;5
Staff was very friendly, from the bellman to thefront desk and even the security personel.  We had two rooms, both were spacious, well appointed and clean.  Awesome beer selection in the bar!  The had renovated since I was there in the late 90's early 00's.  Well done!;5
If the front desk clerk was friendlier,then the hotel would got a better review, but she was not very friendly.  The room was great. It clean and modern and the bedding was rathern nice, but the staircase and the outer hallways are dated and need to be upgraded.;3
I used this hotel for one night before an early flight out of LAX.   The shuttle works well, and even though it's shared with the Westin in didn't take long to get there. On the way back it's only a few minutes to the airport because it doesn't make any stops.   Checkin was very friendly and efficient. I was informed about the free wifi, which worked well. There was a slight issue in that I had been assigned someone else's room (they were not there yet, but had a personalized letter waiting) but it was sorted out quickly and efficiently.   I found the hotel rather loud. There was some noise from the other rooms, but mostly aircraft noise. The runways at LAX are somewhat offset and many hotels sit practically between the runways, so the noise alternates between one plane's;4
This is a very nice hotel. The pool is heated. If you are looking for a bargain, I would suggest you look elsewhere. Local calls are $1.50 a call. Parking is $19.00 a day. The restaurant has great food but it is kind of steep on it's pricing. I had the pork chop dinner and a side salad with a glass of tea and that came to a little over $36.00.The wifi is free or if you need to use the internet through the TV is a little over $10.00. The appliances in the room - iron, blow dryer and a coffee maker. I did see where some of the rooms had a refridgerator - mine did not.  If you don't mind spending a little more and want to be close to LAX then this hotel is for you.;4
Not as well appointed as the better sheratons, and not much around, but central for business meetings and usually very cost effective. the beer bar is oddly spectacular with great variety of beers from around the world.;4
I always choose to stay at a Starwood hotel if I can because I have never been disappointed. Their properties and customer service experience is consistently top notch so you always know what to expect and I like that a lot. Although the aesthetics of this particular hotel is not the best (at least in my perspective) -- lobby environment is not quite as nice as the other Starwood hotels I've stayed at, lobby furniture were a little worn out -- it still meets the Starwood standards and experience that I enjoy, and for the price it was a GREAT VALUE.;4
I researched hotels for almost 20 hoursf before I picked this one, I looked at free shuttle, free breakfast, free park, location, if area was safe to be in and ofcourse the quality of the hotel. I was torn by the old reviews of this Hotel before the make over was complete. All I can say is the hotel was beautiful from the man who was at entrance, to the staff inside. The  lobby was top shelf, the pool with the chairs , waterfall , shaded area was top notch. There is free cofee in the am but they do not tell you , so most people buy it . The room was beautiful with a refrigerator all redone, as were the Hallways. It cost 19 a day to park and no free breakfast, but you were in a top notch property and you felt safe. I visited a few Holiday Inns which all needed work, lobby were;5
I can always expect wonderful accommodations from Four Points and this last overnight stay at the LAX location was extremely an enjoyable event. The value provided from such a major hotel chain was beyond my expectation. Adding to the value was a warm and friendly staff that saw to my comfort and that includes a courteous and timely shuttle to the airport.;5
I have traveled for business and pleasure worldwide and I felt compelled to write my first review of a hotel today. Some background, I left NY on a connecting flight to LA through Philadelphia. When I arrived I learned that my luggage was lost and the people I was to meet for business were stranded in Texas due to in climate weather. The hotel staff more than welcomed me, they embraced me like a long lost family member. They helped me to find a place to shop for clothes, they followed up to make sure I was aware of when my luggage would arrive. They even gave me a gift for my soon to be born grandson. Most important they acknowledged me and were overjoyed when I extended my stay. I will stay at the hotel and recommend it to my clients and friends and my employees when they stay;5
Now offering 24 hour check in which is great for travellers arriving on early morning flights.  Shuttle service works well and is consistent.  Rooms are clean, comfortable and offer tea and coffee making facilties. Great value.;4
"There was good and bad. Good was the free wi-fi, there was very little airport noise; room was clean and adequate size. If we needed anything, the hotel was quick to supply us (like an extra bar of soap since one bar wasn't enough for two people for the length of time we were there). Concierge was very helpful. There are good options for restaurants within 3-5 miles of the hotel. That is a real plus when you realize how long it takes you to get 3-5 miles in LA with the traffic. A 3 mile ride can take 30 minutes or more. The bad - Our room was 64 degrees and the only way we could warm it up was to turn off the a/c and open the door. We called and were told it was area controlled and that was our only option. Our room opened to a hallway and all night long partiers were slamming";3
We stayed here after returning from Tokyo around 6 PM.  The Free Airport Shuttle dropped us off at the front entrance of Fourt Points with our luggage.  We gave him $10 for the ride and for handling our luggage from start to finish.  Helpful when you are jet tired.  Inside the Hotel I saw a long line of people as I approached the desk.  It was manned by 2 people.  And I saw a SPG PREFERRED GUEST counter beside me, so I stood there clueless, thinking the Assigned Agent had stepped away or something, until somebody in line said to me:  I'M A PREFERRED GUEST, TOO BUT THAT COUNTER IS CLOSED. I WISH IT WERE OPEN!  Oops.  I went to be the back of the line.  While standing there-- I noticed that the Spacious Lobby offered free Internet Terminals-- they are Large Screened IMACS mostly;4
The is an average hotel with an average restaurant. The shuttle from LAX was good. The rooms are a bit small and the bathrooms are very small, but the furnishings were okay. What I really didn't like was that my window in my room looked into a hallway. It was like staying in a cheap motel. If I opened my window shade, all of the people using the hallway could look into my room. I also heard every time someone opened or closed their door in this hallway as well as all of the conversations people were having in the hallway.;2
Stayed first night on arrival into the States, fast check-in and the room was nice but it didn't have some of the bathroom amenities - no soap ... so had to call for it which was delivered quickly.  Burgers from Room Service was tasty but very pricey.  Concierge very helpful, shuttle bus very frequent and it is a great place to break before continuing further.  Very comfortable beds but shower/toilet room very small compared to other Sheraton group properties, however vanity unit was outside of this so separate area kinda makes up for lack of large bathroom space.;4
Estela has done an excellent job catering to the needs and requests of patrons, including myself.  Keep up the good work.;5
Hotel is very good value, rooms are big, clean and airey- room service very good, and they serve vege- burgers, shuttle is slow ,so u need to start out at least 15 mins earlier. big screen tv, and plenty of towels. comfy beds;5
My son and I spent 2 nights at the hotel and were very impressed with the service.  Room cleaning, front desk and concierge all were great.  Brewsters food was a little bland but the service was good.  Noise problem with some equipment outside the room was fixed very quickly.  Shuttle service to LAX was frequent and good,  Would most definitely use the Four Points again. Bruce;4
"No one could explain to us the real reason why we had to wait more than 30 minutes for the ""free shuttle"", and we were not too happy to spend another 25 min or more stopping at another hotel to drop others there first.  I suspect this has something to do about LAX regulations pertaining to shuttles but the hotel should know.   The restaurant seemed highly unprepared to serve supper - trouble with place settings, order-taking, etc.  good news: food was quite good.  The room was perfectly nice but when they told me I was upgraded due to being a Starwood Preferred Guest, I expected a view better than the garbage area behind the hotel.  If there are slower elevators in any other hotel, it might be entertaining to ride them.";3
The reservation agent informed me that she reservered a room with one king bed. When I arrived at the hotel the front desk informed me that the reservation was for two double beds. I asked to be moved to another room but the front desk would not do so. I was given a room with an interior view of the hallway. My room was actually facing the interior hallway with no outside view what so ever. I could have stayed at Motel 6 and had a better view.;3
We spent at the Four Points two different periods in the last month during two long layovers between Italy and Hawaii. The hotel offers everything should offer in the airport area. A free shuttle is shared with the Westin Hotel (first step) to connect the terminals 24 hours a day. The check-in/out service is available 24 hours. The check in was very fast and the staff are very friendly. The rooms are clean, good free wi-fi, there isn't fridge in the rooms but on each floor there are  Pepsi brand vendor machines (2 $ for a bottle of 50 oz, and they also take 1 cent coin). The position of the Four Points makes it convenient, you can walk to the most important car hire (Budget is in front, not far from Avis, Hertz is a 5 minute walk along Airport Boulevard). If I have to find a;3
We attended the Trivedi 11-11-11 Retreat that started Thursday night at 6 pm and ended Sunday night at about 11:30 pm.  (No dance music after 10 pm.)    THE GOOD:  Clean room.  Comfortable bed.  Good shower.  Plenty of hot water.  Good wifi.  Didn't turn on the TV.  No fridge in the room.  Friendly staff.  Excellent wait staff.  Very good lunch and dinner food at the 4 day event.  (They served 500 people in a timely manner at each meal.)  The food in the restaurant and sports bar was expensive but very good.  We were on the 2nd floor facing the airport.  The noise from the airport didn't bother us.  Nice lounge area across from the front desk.  Coffee bar has a good chai tea.    THE BAD:  When we checked in at 3:30 pm on Thursday they gave us a room with two double beds instead;4
Whenever we go to Los Angeles, especially when we do a layover enroute to Hawaii from Boston, we always stay at the Four Points by Sheraton hotel at LAX.  It’s got every other Los Angeles airport hotel beat – and here’s why.  They feature an incredible 24-hour check-in policy, which means that your hotel room is yours for 24 hours.  None of that “in at 3 out by 11” stuff.  They are the ONLY hotel at the LAX airport to offer this service, and we highly recommend it.  Room rates start at $119, and you simply have to give the hotel 48-hours notice for the 24-hour check-in. The property also recently underwent a gorgeous renovation and transformation, and when you’re there you’d swear you’re at an elegant, upscale, boutique W hotel. (Which makes sense, as both are owned by;5
We chose to spend the night at Four Points by Sheraton LAX because we had an early flight the next day. The location was perfect. We also ate twice at the bar/restaurant... excellent food. It was pretty busy during the evening but we got served in a timely manner.   After taking the free shuttle, we got to the hotel around noon and our room wasn’t ready. Even if we were a bit tired after an 8 hour flight, we took the concierge’s advice and went on a 4 hour tour to visit L.A. After the tour, we went to our room... it was nice. I just didn’t understand the lights: there was this timer installed on the lights so they would turned off by themselves after a while and turned on when would would pass by (so no need to touch the switch). The timer were setup to turn off after 5 minutes;4
We arrived late - check-in was smooth and efficient. We dropped our bags in the room and went down to the bar for a quick bite to eat and a drink as it had been a long day and no dinner. The service (or lack thereof) we received was absolutely appalling. There was a table behind us who arrived a minute before us. We watched them having their order taken, drinks and food served and practically finished while the same waitress who was in charge of our table never came back after dropping off our menus. At the time there were 3 other tables max occupied - 2 of which were just sitting on a round of drinks - so there was no real excuse for the delay. After waiting for more than half an hour i went up to the bar to complain that we had been waiting for a long time and to ask if;3
I've stayed here several times, and on all occasions, the check-in process took no more than 2 minutes, and the staff has always been extremely friendly.  The newly renovated lobby area (lounge, restaurant & bar) is very nice and a good place to relax after work, have a cocktail, and get some dinner.;5
We had WONDERFUL service at the front desk, and arrived in the morning, expecting to have to wait quite a while. However a few minutes later we were given a GOOD room on a hallway ... the kind that UNluckybuckeye didn't want ... and we heard NOTHING going on in the hallway over the next four days (except a couple of carts going through on very rare occasions. He may have had trouble getting a room because 700 rooms were taken for our event. We, however, had zero complaints, the front desk was exceptional in their responses to our needs, and everyone working for this hotel couldn't have been more hospitable, helpful, and WARMLY caring. Our housekeeper respected our needs and helped make our stay even better than we could have hoped for or expected. What a lovely experience we'll;5
I arrived at the four points in a huge rush. When the staff at the front desk picked up on it, they immediately checked me in, and with a big smile. The whole process couldn't have taken more than 3 minutes. I wish I had taken the time to notice the name of the young lady who helped me, so I could give her credit for a fine job. I was also very happy with the room. Very clean, and many upgrades. I chose this Four Points because of it's location, but will return because of it's friendly staff and care for the customer. Nice job folks! Thanks.;5
This hotel was fine, but the service at the front desk was terrible. I had specifically asked for a quiet room when I phoned reservations, but when I checked in they gave me a room with a large window to a hallway so anytime someone walked by you would hear them as if they were in your room. I immediately phoned the front desk to ask to change and they insisted there was nothing else available. They promised me I could move to a quieter room the next day. Each time there was a break from the seminar I was attending, I would check at the desk, and would get the runaround from the unfriendly staff . . I finally spoke to a manager and was moved, but was given a room where you could here the planes flying over very loudly. I travel quite a bit, and I'm not normally one to complain,;3
The stay was very nice.  The room was clean and the people very friendly.  Mike;5
Although only applicable to rooms that cost more than USD 119 per day, the 24 hour flexible check in and check out feature provided by this hotel is something I've yet to come accross elsewhere and for this reason, I'd say Four Points Sheraton is worth every cent for travellers on transit who end up arriving and flying off from LAX at awkward hours of the day. The free shuttle service provided from LAX airport to the hotel which is located about 2 km away is very helpful since you don't need to worry about getting a taxi. You can safely leave your baggage and stuff in the hotel whilst you take a quick tour of the city after which you can go back to the hotel, wash up and take the free shuttle back to the aiport to catch your flight. Thumbs up for them!;5
Stayed at the LAX Sheraton Four Points for one night before moving out. My impression was that the Sheraton handover (?makeover) was still halfway complete.  Good points: -Location close to LAX and to rental car collection centres.  -Excellent internet and wi-fi access -Wide lounge area -Good in-house security, very alert staff  Need to improve -They were out of King and I was given a room with 2 single beds. First floor overlooking the front. Poster window was very dirty and marred the view badly.  -No fridge and the fabric ice bucket they provided was soft, deformable and leaky. Ice machine didnt work on my floor so had to go upstairs. -Very aged and used look on the frayed carpet, chaffed upholstery and splintered doors. There has been some gloss-over for the rooms (in a;3
I've been to the Four Points at LAX twice now, and look forward to returning soon. While I initially picked it because of its location, after my stay it quickly became a favorite. I came back a second time the following month, and it was even better. Pricing, service, absolute competence and efficiency of the staff, and good advice on local venues (in several languages) make the Four Points at LAX my hotel of choice when coming to Los Angeles. Great food at the bar and grill with, again, a super-perfect staff. Breakfast is tops, too. :);5
I arrived at late evening for a business trip in LA and I took the shuttle to the hotel. The reception is not very patient after she gave me my room key when I asked her where is the breakfast area and the gym in which she just point to the right without looking at me, and she don't even tell me where the elevator is. The room condition was old but overall it is clean and OK, breakfast does not has much choice for the food, not worth if you have to pay for it. The Wifi  internet speed is very slow.;3
I found this hotel to be a little basic.  It was however clean and the staff were friendly and efficient.  Food in the restaurant was again basic. The room was cold at night and we were unable to turn up the heating. Bed fairly comfortable.;3
Great hotel,service and staff ! No complaints, anytime I'm in LA I stay here.;5
The Four Points is a lifesaver that is nicer than it has to be. Its central location,constant,courteously staffed shuttles to LAX,and it's awesomely priced 24hr secured parking for hotel guests is wonderful. There are decent places to get a drink, steak, snack or latte. Shoeshine,laundry etc is all there and efficent. Hotel staff were all kind and never seemed to be idle in lobbies,rooms,restaurants or public lounge areas. Many foreign children and parents had the patient help of the entire staff in keeping toddlers from escaping as parents checked in/out or struggled with more than one child. Not luxurious by any means, but a very unexpected surprise.;4
We were surprised by the reasonable price of a Sheraton airport hotel.  The room was unpretentious and didn't call attention to itself and for that reason was very liveable, like being at home.  We noticed several airline crews checking in.  The concierge called us a car to take us the 18 miles to the La Brea Tarpits and the LA County Museum for only $45 each way.  We liked the wait persons, the restaurant, the quiet location, the privacy, and the proximity of places of interest.  We will stay there again.;5
I would love to stay here the next time I book with Four Points Sheraton it was my first time and won't be my last I gotten the room for a good friend of mine and myself and she was smiling from check in to check out everyone was very friendly where we felt at home and welcomed I plan on comming back with my boyfriend and giving him the experience of a lifetime with the best hotel in Los Angeles I feel. When you have staff going above and beyond their job to make sure your happy and with a smile it makes every moment worth while there's nothing more I can say but this is not just an hotel but it is a place where you can escape and just relax very serene and peaceful I've been telling everyone I know thank you so much you guys for everything its really appreciatied I give this;5
we had a meeting together with the Austrian Tourist Board in this hotel athe Los Angeles airport.the rooms are well equiped not more than 12 month old and have all the amenities you need for a short stay for a meeting.there is no minibar in the room but you get two bottles of mineralwater free of charge.the rooms are well built and you dont hear the airport plane traffic.there is a nice bar in the hotel,which is always crowded and the restaurant meets the needs of the traveller.;4
We parked our car here before we flew from LAX to Charles de Gaulle and stayed there the night we returned. It was wonderful to be able to pick up the shuttle at the airport after the long flight and then check into a clean, quiet room where we could get a good night's sleep before driving back to San Diego.  Staff was friendly and welcoming. For us this cost less than flying from San Diego to LAX, or for just parking our car for two weeks. I almost forgot, they had free water in the rooms! I am so used to seeing overpriced bottled water in hotel rooms that I didn't even read the labels until we were about to leave. Thanks, hotel!;5
needed a place close to the airport and although this isn't five star the service and newly decorated rooms are. If you like beer the bar has an amazing selection, the crowd was fun and the sports on tv was perfect.   Shuttle was on time and a five minute ride, was surprised that the noice from the airport was minimum *could have been the beer though !);5
Stayed at Sheraton Four Points at LAX for 3 days before going on cruise from Long Beach. Rooms were very satisfactory, restaurant was very good and prices were in line with other hotel restaurants. Staff was excellent and very helpful in getting us transportation around LA and back and forth to the Long Beach cruise port at reasonable prices. Shuttle to and from airport was very reliable, never more than a 15 minute wait. This was our second stay there, before and after a cruise, and again were not disappointed. Compared to other LAX hotels, room prices were very reasonable.;4
Booked two rooms here for the night after a long flight from LHR before driving the next day to Las Vegas. Rooms were fine and the beds were comfy. Had a drink and snack in Brewsters the evening we arrived but the menu not that good. Breakfast was OK, all the staff very friendly. The only comment really was there was only one of each tea bag and coffee in the room when two people are occupying the room there should be two of everything. Would stay there again if the rates are good.;4
We stayed here after landing from London so that we could be ready to hit the road the next day on our trip up Highway 1. We used the free hotel shuttle bus from the terminal which was easy to catch. Check in was seamless and really speedy and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Our room was spacious with two double beds and modern fittings. The curtains had black outs which was great. The room had a fridge and coffee maker and there was free wifi which was good too. We did use the pool in the morning - towels were provided which was handy. There was also a small gym which we used and was adequate. We did take a look at the restaurant but there was not a great choice for dinner so we actually popped across to Burger King.  I would definately stay here again if I needed;4
We arrived in LA following a 14 hour flight from Sydney booked in for one night (October 2nd). The airport transfer is great, takes you right to the door of the hotel. We tried to check in but was told there was a blackout of the entire block so was unable to check into our room. We stayed around for a few hours, with the staff offering bottles of water plus some food while we were waiting. Some free entertainement was also provided with some angry customers venting at the staff which was unecessary and they all handled themselves exceptionally, especially Adam who was the manager at the time. The staff should be commended!!;4
I stayed two nights however the first night started off good but ended with people staying in room 525 making loud noises until 4:30 a.m. Around 3 a.m. I called the front desk with my complaint regarding my neighbors and was told they would be notified. At 4 a.m. the noise continued and I again called the front desk who told me they'd have security look into the matter. Around 4:30 the noise final stopped allowing me about 1.5 hours of peaceful rest before waking up and getting ready for a day filled with meetings.;3
I booked a KING bed room which was not available when I checked in at 945pm.  I was given a room with 2 very small doubles.  NO window except one looking out on a hallway.  NO electrical outlets in the bathroom.  stains on the carpet.  I expected more from a Sheraton hotel.;2
After a long frustrating day traveling, my family and I were ready to pass out.    Ciro at the front desk, totally turned around our day!   With a smile he expeditioulsy checked us in and gave us a quick run through.   It was the medicine we needed.   Hotel was clean and rooms were nice.;5
This was our last night in USA after an extended roadtrip.  We were looking for an hotel near the airport and near to the car rental return.  We had stayed at other hotels near LAX in the past but this was ideal.  On arrival we were greated by the bellhop who dealt with our luggage while I checked in, we were given a room upgrade and while we returned the hire car our luggage was put in our room. Good computer facilities and printer for online check-in - no charge.  We had a very good dinner with excellent service and the room was comfortable and clean.  The shuttle to the airport was prompt with a helpful driver.  Having got a good discount booking direct on the internet it was more than worth the money for a pleasant and hassle free stay.;5
"We stopped at the Four Points LAX to break a journey from NY to Sydney, in both directions.  The hotel is basically a good value for money hotel.  It was ideally located for us, as we did not want to travel too far from the airport for a 24 hour stopover.  What was ideal for our requirements was the 24 hour boooking arrangement, whereby a room can be booked from the time of your arrival for up to 24 hours for a daily rate (rather than arriving late afternoon and either having to check out many hours ahead of the onward flight, or paying two daily rates).  The deal was ideal for our requirements; the accommodation standard was good, as well as good value; the service was good. The concierge desk was very helpful explaining transport options for us to make a couple of day trips.";3
I've stayed here in the past when traveling through LA and had a really good experience.  It's an airport hotel so I was pleasantly surprised.  Not so much on my return visit.  I guess they put me in the nicest, quitest room on my last visit so I didn't even look for other options for my three nights this past week.  You would think that you would put someone staying for three nights at an airport hotel (when the lionshare of people are one nighters) in one of the more recently updated and nicer rooms, no such luck.  The termostat was broken in the room and wouldn't rise above 62 so I had to either freeze or shut it off.  When I arrived at 10PM I wanted to get some dinner but there wasn't a menu in the room.  It took three calls and 10 minutes to reach a live person just to get;2
We booked 2 rooms at 4 Points LAX for the beginning of our USA trip from Australia.  We were very happy with both rooms and pleased they were able to accommodate our request for rooms beside each other.  In fact they were directly opposite at the end of a hall.  Perfect.  We had no problem finding our way to the hotel using the shuttle service.  The hotel was in a great location for the airport which was just what we were looking for.  Check in was quick and easy which we appreciated after our long flight.    One room was upgraded and had a separate sitting area.  The room was large, clean and well appointed and had a view of the pool.  The other room was as we had booked and had a great view of planes landing.  There was no noise issue with that at all.  The beds were large and;5
I stay here a few times a year. The price and its affiliation with Starwood are the two driving factors. Nothing exceptional, but definitely a good value. Beds are nice enough. Bathrooms are recently redone. Rooms are comfortable if oddly-decorated (Four Points still hasn't found a real style or common look). Room service is quick. Good beer selections in the bar, though the food was less exciting and despite the army of servers, the service could have been better. A perfectly fine choice for a night or two on business or an overnight at the airport, but I wouldn't plan a vacation around this place.;3
"I arrived around midnight; very tired after a long day of driving from Santa Barbara Ca to San Simeon and back to LAX.  Had small breakfast that morning and I was tired and hungry. I ws very happy when Baltazar Ochoa told me there was room at the faility; all I could think about was a quick dinner, fast sleep for I had a morning flight to catch.  I ordered room service for dinner and it came quickly and taste great.  I am thankful for the kind service and quick accomodations; thank you all so much.";5
Well,if you like sleeping on a urine sopping wet bed,this is the hotel for you.The management informed us they were not able to adjust our rate due to us booking through a third party.They did move us into another room but I feel we should have never had to go through this experience of laying on an urine wet mattress.;1
We have stayed  here many times because of the park & fly.  The last few times the rooms are too cold and never warm up, even though the thermostat is set to 80.  On our last stay, there was a Dorsey High School Homecoming Party in the San Diego room.  We tried to eat in the restaurant and were disturbed by the party goers all over the lobby and going in & out of the room.  There was no control over them by the hotel or the high school.;3
These Missourians felt at home at Four Points LAX. The check in staff was very knowledgeable as well as helpful in giving directions to a mall to find twin grandsons a surprise gift. We will definitely stay there again when the opportunity presents itself.  Being that close to the airport and having shuttle service to & from was great. Also being so close to the rental car pick-up and return was very handy. We had trouble with our room key, but after a couple of trys it was resolved. Thanks for a great stay!!;5
The rooms are atrociously outdated.  I checked in late so it's possible they were just sold out of the better rooms, but I booked it through hotels.com and it wouldn't be the first time I was given a bad room intentionally for using a discount website.  The rooms are small and it has a motel feel type to it.  All the furniture are old, the bathroom is small and again is more like a motel bathroom.  The AC is what takes the last straw.  There's no room temp control.  The AC is the old school type which is below the window with basically 2 buttons, hot/cool.  Free bottle of water tho.....woo hoo!;2
The service just keeps getting better.  On this trip I experienced a migraine and was very ill and was treated with assistance in trying to make me comfortable until this episode passed.  It is a little frightening to get ill and not be at home but my worries were laid aside because I was treated with kindness and empathy.  Housekeeping made the room dark and quickly changed the sheets in order that my warm aching head could lie down on cool clean sheets.  Juan suggested I talk with my doctor for a potential vitamin deficiency which was very nice of him.  As usual I am treated like a family member when I visit and not a paying guest.  The hotel is clean, safe, great food and service.  I look forward to my next visit.;5
Stayed for two night for work in the area. Service was good. Has ok restaurant and bar area. Rooms were fair. Overall good value. Shuttle to LAX every 15-20 min.;3
Just a short 1 night stay before catching early flight from LAX. Room was great. On top floor and newly renovated. Loved the mattresses [pillow top?]. Had a restaurant that we didn't try. Walk to fast food or liquor store [also didn't try]. Room space a little limited by a large recliner chair. Would have been better off without it. Large bathroom, but only 1 bar of soap for both shower and basin. Charges for local phone calls. 1 computer for guests. 1st 15 minutes are free, then charges apply. Can print airline boarding passes for free.Prompt airport shuttle service. Good value for the price we paid.;5
I stayed here for a night at the beginning of a trip from LA and again on the way back.  Very convenient to the airport with a free shuttle bus every 20 minutes.  Helpful staff, helpful bus drivers too!  Nice big comfy beds and bathrooms OK.  If you don't want to pay hotel restaurant prices, there is a convenience store tucked away in a side street opposite the hotel that has all sorts of stuff.  I enjoyed a hot dog with sauce, pickles, mustard for 2 bucks and stocked up on some snacks for the long wait at LAX for a night flight.;4
I have never been more impressed with any other catering servers. Mentionably Estela Estrada. She was so kind, attentive and curtious. I was so surprised to find this kind of service at a sheraton.;4
"Thanks for your kindness ; needed a wheelchair and they had one; only hotel we found to be able to accommodate; plus the rate was great and worth the stay; clean and very helpful; a good breakfast; I recommend this hotel";5
We stayed at the Four Points LAX during a layover in October.  The staff was extremely welcoming and checking in at 11:30 a.m. was no problem.   They actually have a 24 hour non-time limited check in program for layover folks -  you check in at  9 am , your room is yours until next 9 am -- you check in at 11 pm,  your room is yours until next 11 pm....   Very accomodating concept --- you have to arrange and ask for it at booking -- but a very nice feature for air travellers.  It's not available on the lowest room rates -  but for an extra $20 off the bargain basement rates, the flexibility is wonderful..    Staff was great,  decor was a re-do in a modern chic style ...  nice in some aspects, wierd in others.  The rooms don't have drawers -  but cubicle bins  -   --  It's;3
Location: excellent, close to the LAX airport. Free shuttle service to and from the airport. Accommodation: Basic. The rooms are clean with a fridge, hair dryer, bottled water. There is no safe. Just hanging space for clothes. No drawers, just boxes for putting clothing into. Unsightly but functional. WiFi: Free, in room and throughout hotel. Meals: Buffet breakfast was reasonable for US$15/- plus tax. American breakfast was US$12/-. There was an in house cafe that served burgers, sandwiches and the usual food. Room service was also available. If you are ired of the food in the hotel, then there is Burger King diagonally across from the hotel. Comment: The rooms were cheap for about US$99/- per night. Given the proximity to the airport and the amenities with the free shuttle;4
Though this hotel is newly refurbished, I found it to be very average.  The room I stayed in reminded me of a motel.  You walk down a hallway with rooms only on one side of the hall and on the other side of the hall was facing outside the building, but was enclosed with glass (if that makes any sense).  The window in the room is right next to the door (as opposed to being on the opposite wall of the door as it is in most hotels).  The room itself was clean and decent size.   The staff was friendly and helpful.  The hotel bar had a large selection of beer (mostly bottled) but did have about 10 on tap that were imported.  I did find the parking to be strange.  There is a small lot behind the building, but no real walkway to the hotel.  You walk on the pavement and need to be;3
The hotel itself is adaquet, bar, restuarant, pool, workout room.  It was the service that makes this hotel above the notch.  The room cleaners were always nice and asking me if I needed anything, check-in was fast and all the other staff I interacted with were concerned for me and whatever needs I may have.  The only bummer I had was it doesn't have a steam or sauna room, which I was looking forward to.  If you're a beer drinker, the bar is the place for you!  They have a world array of beer and I'm sure your favorite is there.  Close to LAX and you can beat traffic, which is bad into the airport.;4
There is  nothing speciall about this place just a nice airport hotel whit a free shuttle to the airport and nice facilities, the right choise for you lax airport hotel;4
We picked this hotel because we had a midnight flight the day after our arrival, and this is the only hotel I had ever heard of with a 24hour room policy.  (With some rooms, booked directly from the hotel, you can check out at any time up to 24 hours after your check-in time).  We checked in at 8pm and left the same time the next day.  We spent just slightly more than we would have for a one night stay, but much less than we would have for two nights (which is what every other hotel wanted to charge for a checkout after 12 noon.)   Because of that, I recommend it.    I had read reviews/warnings about un-remodeled rooms.  That was easily solved with a $20 (the difference between the room rates) fee to guarantee a room in a remodeled tower.  This is not one of Sheraton's nicer;3
Checkin at 2300hrs was pretty weak: 1 person in line ahead of me, 2 people behind me, one agent, took 20 minutes til she could be freed up and see us. Our check in took 30 seconds. Didn't get a SPG Plat upgrade. Room was nice, but getting a bit dated. Clean. Loud AC. Internet had avg speed.  The pool was awesome, really nice for a 4pts. Woulda expected this from a Sheraton or something. There was a bar, too, but from what I recall, it was a bit pricy.  There was a parking charge as well. Like most parking charges, this can be avoided by looking around for free parking.   Location was meh. It's an airport hotel, whadda expect.  The amenities here are top notch for a 4 points, I'll come back if I ever get stranded.;4
I arrived at the LAX Sheraton 4Points during a bad couple of days for the hotel.  Last things first - on my last day there was an area power outtage lasting several hours.   All electricity in the hotel was effected and guests had to get their luggage down  to the lobby by the stairs because the elevators did not work.    Does this hotel have a protocol for emergencies?   I would expect that protocol for a major power outtage would require guest notification of electricity interruption via staff going room to room to offer luggage assistance  and to explain the situation to the guests.  No notification by LAX 4Points staff was remitted  until the guest made it down to the lobby area (via the dark stairway).    Other negatives:  During my stay, the shower fixture broke off and;1
I've stayed at this hotel many, many times over the last 11 years and have found it to be quite comfortable. The free shuttle is quick and convenient, and the staff is always willing to accommodate. Several long-term staff members recognize me, which is always nice.  On this last trip, my room was free thanks to the Starwood Rewards program.  I was upgraded to a junior suite, which was beautiful and absolutely huge!  They also brought me a plate of grapes and fresh-baked cookies my first night, and free bottled water was provided throughout my stay.  Definitely a first-class experience!;5
Having read some of the previous reviews I was somewhat concerned prior to my arrival at this property. I was allocated a deluxe queen bedroom in the renovated West Tower. The corridors were clean and the room was spacious and well appointed. I did not venture into the East Tower so I cannot comment on rooms etc in that wing. The bathroom was spacious with an excellent shower. Internet was free and worked well, with quite a reasonable speed. The hotel provides a 24 hour shuttle service to LAX. It is also well located for connections to buses and the green line of the LA Metro. One disappointing aspect was the lack of an in room safe. Also staff appeared to be somewhat impersonal and somewhat difficult to deal with. Overall a very good property offering comfortable accommodation.;4
I was keenly impressed by the entire Sheraton staff & the consistent customer satisfaction with which we were provided.  Specifically Gina Michael, Assistant Front Office Manager, whom went above and beyond the scope of obligations required of an employee.  Ms. Michael demonstrates a rare compassion and courteous professionalism. I suffer from a lifetime stomache condition and Ms. Michael thoughtfully and graciously honored my request by extending my check out time until 2:00 pm, as I was in so much discomfort and was struggling to walk.  Ms. Michael clearly demonstrates a huge capacity of concern for her applicants.  Thank you. P.S.  My brother is employed by the Sheraton in Kauai for several years now.  I shall make certain to pass on my commentary to him.;5
I am writing this review as a kudos to Ciro and the front desk, bellhop, and concierge team that were on duty the afternoon of Sunday, October 2nd.  We had reserved and pre-paid for a room at this hotel, but when we arrived, we were told that there was no electricity, and the LA Dept. of Water and Power did not have a clue how to fix things.  Because I was traveling with my wife and our infant daughter, we were seated alone in a quiet, comfortable place to the side of the lobby while we waited to see if the power would not come on.  When it became clear that it wouldn't come on soon, Ciro and the staff accomodated us very well by reserving a room for us at the Westin (which did have power and which Four Points paid for) and getting us a complimentary taxi to take us over there.;5
I have stayed at this hotel many times and this last time was the best.  They have upgraded their rooms and bathrooms to a very good standard and they seem to have improved the sound proofing between the rooms as I had a very quiet night.  The check in was excellent, quick and friendly. The breakfast service was very good.;4
This hotel ie perfect as there is a free shuttle from LAX and a 24hr rate - we arrived at 9pm and left at 7pm the next day at a very reasonable cost .Manhatten beach is only 20 mins on the bus - which is a wonderful place to visit - smashing beach lots of restaurants etc ..but do not miss Brewsters in the hotel - fantastic selection of real ales and atmosphere .;5
The room was clean and comfortable.  All the staff I encountered were friendly, and service was efficient.  The car rental company inside the hotel was equally professional and courteous.  I recommend this hotel!;4
Our stay was just over night however our orrom was very run down. The sink leaked badly, the rug and chari had terrible stains and spots, the T.V was old and all in all the room was badly in need of a complete remodel.;2
This location was very disappointing coming from  the Sheraton brand. Once we arrived in the hallway of our room, we were hit with the smell of marijuana and the inside of the room had a sour musty smell. Another thing is that the room they put us in was very tiny and set up like a Motel 6 with a large glass window next to the bed facing the enclosed hallway! You can tell that this area of the building used to be a outside balcony that was enclosed after the renovation. The room was dirty and did not have a safe feel to it! I had my 5 year old daughter with me and got on the phone with management immediately! They moved us to the other side of the hotel that was a night and day difference from the previous room. The new room was better but still very small, bathroom is tiny, and;2
My daughter and I booked a room for the night so that we could enjoy the sights of Los Angeles.  We had a fabulous time!  We were impressed by the fabulous staff and facility of the Sheraton Four Points, everyone was so accommodating and friendly.  We were impressed by the lovely room, we actually stayed in the junior suite.  It was very clean and had all of the conveniences that one could want.  We were impressed with the restaurant and the outdoor pool, the wait staff was courteous and polite. Thank you Sheraton Four Points for making our stay so wonderful!  If you need a hotel close to LAX, that's easy to find and where the people are friendly and helpful, this is the place for you!;5
We pricelined this hotel for $69. The airport shuttle was quick. (Look for the Westin LAX / Four Points blue bus which picks up on the RED island outside all baggage claims every 15mins.) The check in was quick. The room was decent, flat screen TV, clean bathroom, but the rugs need cleaning or replacing. We stay in lots of hotels and I noticed. The shuttle back to the airport was quick and friendly.;3
the rooms are VERY small and dark.  Pool is nice. .;2
We have stayed here before and it is excellent for a hotel near LAX. Unfortunately the shuttle bus shows up for the 5:30 am shuttle already 3/4 full and doesn't have enough room for the crowd waiting. We ended up paying for a cab in order to catch our flight. Otherwise a great hotel with great service and facilites.;4
If you can stay at this property for under $100, go for it. My room was VERY clean. Bed was comfortable. Loved the set aside bathroom. Funny how when a hotel provides 2 free bottles of .50 cent water, you feel as though they really care about you! Love the free wifi and free airport shuttle. I arrived at 9:30pm and the place was BUSY. Lots of flight crews stay here. The shuttle at 5:30am was packed! If you need a place to stay near LAX, I recommend this property, but pay under $100.;4
Had originally prepaid for 2 nights accomodation here but on arrival at 430pm we were told we were unable to check in due to a blackout affecting the whole block(which included 4 hotels). It was suggested we go on a night tour of LA to kill time which was a great suggestion from the guest services staff.  Upon returning form our tour at 930pm there was still no power= no check so we obviously needed to find alternate accomodation. Unfortunately the front desk staff felt it was up to the customers to ring around to do this themselves, so we asked to speak to the manager and Adam was more than helpful in locating a hotel that was not affected by the power blackout and transporting us over ot it.  We returned to this hotel the next day @ 930am, with the hotel paying for our return;4
"I had a ""deluxe room"" here for a week during the month of September for a seminar. The room was updated and a bit small which was fine as I was away for most of the day. There is a fantastic gym that's open 24 hours which I used every day as well as an amazing heated pool. The pool area is also done nicely with lounge chairs and cabanas. The hotel staff are all really friendly and would always say hi as they walked by. The bar downstairs has some great food as well.  The only downside to my stay was that there was that the wireless internet was virtually useless and that there was no refrigerator in the room.  My roommate and I would just walk over the Marriott across the street and use their free wifi in the lobby. In regards to the refrigerator I asked about it at the front";4
I was recently at this hotel for a 4 day business review. Overall the facility was great & the gym equipment was excellent & very clean. Food was good once we specified the types of cuisine. Estela Estrada was extremely attentive & made me a personal salad 2 days as I do not eat dairy. Her service was second to none. I was expecting a lot of aircraft noise & was pleasantly surprised that the building is very well insulated from noise pollution.;4
I was reserving this hotel using miles, it was one of cheaper options for 3-4* hotels. It had Sheraton in its name - how bad could it be?  Pretty bad. The common areas are nice but once you take an elevator you end up in something more like a motel. Mushy smell in rooms and hallways, room windows facing hallway (!), smaller than average bathroom.  The beds and pillows were comfotable.  Oh, they also want printout of the online confirmation. I had to use their paid computer/printer to get one, another $7 for 5 minutes.;2
I enjoyed my overnight stay. The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive.The room was very nice and I had a comfortable night. I had some dinner and breakfast and the service was good and the food delicious. Iarrived a little after five pm and thought I would find a long check in line but I had no wait and was checked in by Lizette Rodriguez who professional and friendly and made me feel welcomed. speaking of personnel I enjoyed my breakfast where Marcella greeted me with a big smile and Patty was my waitress and not only handled my order efficiently but added some humer to the morning. Overall I had a great stay, easy in and out, great price,great nights sleep,and good people taking care of my needs. I will stay there again and recommend it to others.;5
Overall I was adequately impressed by the hotel. Room was clean and updated and nice size.  Staff was friendly and accomodating.  Restaraunt food was good and bar was convenient.;4
We stayed one night before an early flight. The first room that they booked for us was unacceptable so they were very nice and changed our room to the renovated tower. The bed needed a new mattress and you could feel the grainy mattress pad through the sheets.The owner needs to spend some serious money to upgrade the hotel. I must say that I liked the upgraded mid century modern look in the lobby and the upgraded room. The brown carpet in the hallways is depressing and should be changed to something brighter.I understand that there is only so much you can do with a hotel of this age(such as bathroom size) and I think the mid century modern is the correct direction.The airport shuttle was more than efficient. One last item-the toiletries were not full so I think they had been;2
I booked the Four Points for a quick overnight stay.  I was recognized by being a Starwood Preferred Member when I checked in at the front desk.  I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the room.  It appeared to have been recently remodeled.  The bed was comfortable and the desk was a nice size.  The facility itself is old.  The elevators were extremely slow, with one totally out of order.  There was a pool, restaurant and bar.  The room came with complimentary wireless internet access.  My shower curtain liner was moldy and had a bad, musty smell.  I called the front desk to see about having it replaced.  Instead of sending someone from housekeeping, they sent an engineer to change the curtain rod.  I explained that all I needed was a new shower curtain liner.  One was sent;3
The Four Points Sheraton at LAX is an Excellent hotel.  Right outside the airport - very convenient.  Super nice front desk reception.  Quick check-in and very clean rooms;5
I am a frequent stayer at Four Points LAX and always find amazing service when I stay.. This weeks trip was no difference. I had just flown in to LA after a long flight From Istanbul via New York... welcomed to my room straight away, the bed was super cozy and I slept soundly for 8 hours straight. There was little to no airplane noise despite staying at an airport hotel. The next day I spent time at the pool soaking up the 85F weather and could even access the complimentary wifi poolside... Staff at front desk are great and on this trip that included front desk agent martin.  This hotel offers excellent value for money, super comfortable beds in a modern well very well hotel. Give it a go - a great experience awaits.;5
I don't know why there are so many good reviews about this hotel!  We had the worst experience at this hotel - it's almost like a large motel.  It lacks staff so there is always a long line at the counters.  The lighting isn't bright in the rooms and hallways so it feels seedy.  The elevators are slow.  The bathrooms are really old and outdated.    We tried to check in at 2PM (for 2 rooms) and were told that our rooms weren't ready yet and to come back in an hour.  We came back later that night and checked into our rooms.  Walking into my 'clean' room, the sheets were messed up, trash full, and bathroom used. In the 7 hours that they had to clean the room, it doesn't look like much was done.  After waiting almost an hour in line at the front desk, we got a new room.  This room;2
If you are at this hotel, you are likely in transit and just want a clean bed and decent meal.  This hotel delivers and surpasses.  The public areas are pleasant and modern, there are two restaurants (although the pub just serves an edited version of the main restaurant menu), and the outdoor pool area is quite nice.  Both dinner and the breakfast buffet surpassed expectations, and the service was good.  The room was clean and well-furnished, with those excellent 4 Points toiletries.  Bell staff was very helpful, and shuttle to airport in the morning was quick and efficient.;4
Stayed in the Four Points last week.   Hotel lobby looks great! Staff are friendly! But it seems like the last renovation was done only to the lobby. I stayed on the third floor, east tower. Once I got out of the elevator, the hallway smelled…. The room was ok, I am a clean freak on hotel rooms, I have no complain on cleanliness, but the bed was not comfy. You can feel the Box Spring, especially on the edge of the bed… And wireless doesn’t work properly, it only worked on certain “Sweet spot” we found in the room, plus it was slow.  Did not try their restaurants so cannot comment.  Gym was small, but have everything you need. Usually not crowded. It was divided into two sections, one with the treadmills and bikes, the other for weights etc. The weight room, air conditioning was;3
I've stayed at most LAX airport hotels but I keep coming back to the Four Points because it feels comfortable, friendly and I am treated well (being a Starwood Platinum member might help there).  Four Points seems to have more leisure/family travelers than the more upscale hotels nearby.  That makes for a more relaxed environment.  The hotel has a mix of refurbished rooms (flat screen TV, new decor etc) and older rooms.  There are lousy older rooms in the middle tower whose windows overlook the corridor.  Then there are better older rooms which are big and spacious but lack the modern decor.  Just avoid the lousy rooms in the middle tower and all is good.  The free shuttle bus works well, the outdoor pool is warm and relaxed, the fitness room has a good mix of cardio machines;4
I usually stay at the Hilton LAX but I thought I'd give this one a try. The pictures oversell the place....never again!!! Lobby isn't too bad, but the tip off should have been the caked on paint, rusted fire sprinklers, and scuffed up elevator doors. When I went into the room, I thought I was back in a Motel 6 (or worse, the Los Alamos Inn). The bath tub valve went a full 360 degrees and it was hard to get it to turn off (drip, drip, drip). Wireless didn't work, not enough plugs at the desk and no plugs in the bathroom. I had to make the morning coffee on the floor. --Want to take a hot bath, bring disinfectant first. On top of all this, they got my invoice wrong and I now have to write a letter to get it fixed.;1
Just wanted to say that Estela Estreda provided me with excellent service as I worked my Conference. Made sure I was taken care of and need for nothing.. Great Job!!!;5
Great hotel.  Very handy shuttle to airport and as we were there on our honeymoon recieved a upgrade to a suite.  Staff were very friendly and even gave us a congtratulations card and free drink at the bar which we thought was a very nice touch.  Suite was very nice and clean.  We used the concierge to book a couple of trips and these went very well also.;5
We arrived late into the night, but although it was busy, were welcomed, a couple of questions answered and were processed very quickly by the Assistant Manager. Nice to see they still help out at unsocial hours.  Our room was very nice, although a large person would have struggled getting into the bathroom! Very comfortable bed, and quiet aircon to ensure a good sleep before/after traveling. Coutresy bus every 20 mins to/from LAX, and we didn't hear planes at night. Probably as we were inside the building with our window opening onto the corridor to gain borrowed light - this meant we had to pull a roller blind down for privacy, but the effect was excellent - silence. Lovely pool, rooms spotlessness clean plus above average toiletries and coffee, with pots of liquid creamer not;4
Solid sleep, good location (for an airport hotel - across from car rental lot for convenience and direct free shuttle), the restaurant served a brilliant breakfast (DO NOT ORDER THE BUFFET).  Good prices - what more to ask for?;4
We stayed there because the sheraton in culver city was full the night we got there. This was great and they took care of us professionally and friendly! Made our inconvenience turn into a good night! We were glad and they were really good about it all!  And it really is in a good spot! Right in the middle of alot of stuff to do all within 30 mins apporx! Goes to show that there are good people and good places out there! And they are worth staying at!! THIS IS one of those places!!!;4
All we wanted was a reasonably priced hotel with a 3 star rating minimum, no more than 5 miles from our destination, Santa Monica.  Four Points Sheraton not only fit all of our criteria, but we were pleasantly surprised that the hotel offered so much more as well.  After researching various booking sites and calling Four Points directly, we found the best deal on getaroom.com.  At first we were skeptical because it was substantially lower than the lowest advertised room rate, but everything was legitimate.  For almost $50 cheaper than comparable rooms in the Santa Monica area, the drive may be a bit longer, but the savings were well worth it.  However, parking here is $19, but there are in and out privileges.  Regardless, Four Points was still cheaper than a lot of other hotels;3
After a stay at a not so great resort, we almost kissed the ground when we arrived at Four Points after midnight and found friendly staff, a FANTASTIC room and the bar open for snacks and drinks. Check in was later than most places, great after a long flight and the bed was amazing to sleep in so we did sleep in late! Although our card to check out did not work when we left the parking lot, a real person was at the exit gate to correct the problem and it was all taken care of in less than a minute - by a present person and not someone in another romm via a speaker. Wow, what a concept - great customer service!  This was by far the best Park Fly Stay ( in that order) that we have been to. If this is what all Four Points are like, I am ripping up my Hilton card and becoming a fan;5
I often check reviews on tripadvisor, but do not post.  After my stay at the Sheraton Gateway LAX, I have to post.  First of all the rate seemed too good to be true.  I had read the negative reviews and thought -its a Sheraton property who bad can it be?  I booked direct with the hotel.  I have stayed at various LAX hotels but never at the Four Points LAX.  The rate was what encouraged me to give it a try.   When I arrived the lobby looked clean and pleasant.  The check in was not warm and friendly. It was very matter of fact.  The windows along the walkway to my room were filthy. The maids in the hallway were accompanied by a man that I caught staring into the room of a guest.  I looked to see what he was looking at and it was a another female guest (creepy).  The windows face;2
I don't even know where to start with this place....The lobby is beautiful and clean. But that's where the complement ends...The staff is rude and not helpful at all!! This is not a 3.5 star hotel as advertised by bookit.com!! The elevator sounds and feels as if its going to break down. Than as you get off of the elevator you are greeted with the odor of dirt and musk. That smell is not just limited to the hallway but also the room. This place looks as if it use to be a run down apt. complex.  The cost per night at this place is not worth it! Way to expensive for the poor room condition and awful customer service!!  My clue to skip this place should've been the ” No Refund” policy on bookit.com. There's no refund because they would go out of business if they had to refund money;1
Very unimpressed to arrive at this hotel at 9.30pm to be told my room wasnt ready!! I had just come off a 12 hour flight and it was 6am for me so not what you want to be hearing at this time. Staff did not seem to care and advised it will still be another 30-60 minutes until room was ready. Made a few complaints and got the room quicker but shouldnt have had to.  Room was okay, bathroom needs a desperate upgrade. Room service very expensive and food not worth it. Quiet room tho which was appreciated and free shuttle to airport. Wifi is free but the slowest I have expereinced in a very long time.;2
The hotel lobby is average and the staff was mediocre.  The food in the restaurant was good and the wait staff friendly.  From when we got off the elevator onto our floor we were starting to feel that booking this hotel was going to be a disappointment.  Hallway carpet is dirty, fraying at the seams and rippled, one can easily trip.  Room was okay, perhaps a little out dated, and the bed was fine... then we went into the bathroom.  The tub had ground in dirt so bad that we put a towel on the bottom of the tub (see picture).  This was a problem that a little bleach soaking in the tub could remedy and Soft Scrub with a scrub brush would do wonders.  Parking was another issue.  My husband is handicap and when we were leaving they tired to charge us for using their parking lot,;2
Used the Four Points at LAX International Airport as a stop overnight in order to catch another flight the next day. The staff were very friendly and helpful but the rooms are a bit dated and tired. Everything worked though and was clean. The regular free shuttle back to the airport is a great service.;3
The rooms in this hotel are like a roadside motel, below expectations for even the budget brand of national chains. Parking is awkward, where you have to walk down a ramp, past the hotel garbage, with no sidewalk, to get into the hotel.  Cleaning staff threw away my zip-lock bag needed for TSA and front desk didn't have a replacement to provide.  An elevator got stuck, not the one I was on, but they kept us on our elevator so they could work on the stuck one.  Terrible experience.;1
The best way to describe the four points is that it once was an old hotel that has been renovated. So the hotel has an old feel about it. There was even a section that looked like the old style motel rooms (rooms with an outside balcony) that has now been enclosed and air-conditioned.  Rooms were pleasant and clean. The only downfall is no fridge but they do provide an ice bucket and free ice.;3
My wife and I stay here a lot.  We travel in and out of the US via LAX so the location is perfect for us.  If you're in LA on holiday, there are much better locations to stay, but if you're here for business and connecting through LAX, it's hard to beat.  You can check in and check out at any time during the day or night, so you're not stuck with that problem of arriving at LAX at dawn, only to be told by reception that your room will not be available until after lunch. The Starwood Preferred Guest system works well and we often get a room upgrade - try not to stay in the Tower but ask for one of the recently renovated rooms on the upper floors of the main building. The new rooms have a strange designer storage system, where you put your stuff in cartons, instead of drawers, but;4
"Nice, clean Sheraton hotel.  Nothing fancy, rooms are a bit small, but functional & well maintained.  Airport shuttle service is 24 hours & free, but you'll pay to park your car.   Front desk staff could have been more helpful (but hey, it isn't the Marriott or the Hilton);  & separate guest services desk makes up for it --- they were very helpful.  Don't forget to check out the bar/restaurant & great gift shop.  Overall, a good value for the price.";3
We stayed at this hotel since it was one that had a special family rate by my child's college and it turned out to be a pleasant place to stay. We had our entire family including elders and children. The children enjoyed swimming at the heated pool, and the elders enjoyed the simple but relaxing atmosphere.   The rooms we were given were upgraded and clean. The beds were comfortable with clean sheets. The bathroom was older, but kept clean. For the price we paid, the value was well worth it.;4
Stayed during a Saturday night layover in LAX.  The room was listed as $20 less than the Westin and since we were only going to be in the hotel for 7 hrs chose to save money.    The Good:  Shuttle was prompt at the airport.  The lobby area was remodeled and the lobby bar had good food and 100 different beer selections.  The Bad:  The room was very old and the bed was not comfortable.  There was a basket of a previous guests junk in the closet.  There was a used bar of soap in the shower.  There was hair in the bed.  The door to the room and the room walls are very thin and we were up most of the night with loud hallway noise and what sounded like someon dropping bricks in the room down the hall.  A call to the front desk did help to quiet it down but overall the sleep quality;2
Perfect hotel after a long flight to the USA and a resting stop before a long trip home.;5
I was extremely disappointed in the Four Points at LAX.  I previously stayed at a Four Points in Baltimore and thought it was nice.  Unfortunately, this Four Points is run down and outdated.  The beds were old, and the sheets had old stains on them.  I decided not to take a bath because the bad didn't look clean.  The toilet seat was also dirty and I had it wipe it down.  Since my mother was tired from the flight, I decided to tough it out instead of going through the pain of changing rooms or even changing hotels.  I won't be returning to this hotel, especially at the price they are charging.;2
"Want to express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Musie Kahsay for his outstanding assistance during my stay at Four Points By Sheraton / Los Angeles Intl. Airport , also the rest of hotel team were very friendly with big smile on their faces all the time , they are role model  , meantime want to mention that this is my second time to stay in this very beautiful hotel ; first time was in Christmas  2007 when I met also for the first time Mr Kahsay ( his good  behavior still the same asking for any assistance , any information which could help and so on )    , the hotel is very clean , service is outstanding with very friendly atmosphere ; I decided each time when I come to Los Angeles I will stay in this nice hotel as if it is my home       Once again so many thanks for the great";5
"This hotel was about $100 a night but you've never know it from its appearance - very clean, aesthetically pleasing and friendly, courteous, well-dressed and maintained staff. Jorge Medrano was a great service provider, with a smile, engaging personality and exhibited patience.  My only ""complaints"" are that the LAX bus is right outside of my window so I heard it throughout the night making stops and announcments (any way to create noise-proof windows?) and a pair of my socks went missing and despite my efforts to retrieve them, they were not found.  Still, overall, a great stay.  Will do it again.";4
After trying other parking options when flying out of LA (we live a few hours away, so it's not just a drive across town), we stumbled upon the Four Points LAX.  Now, we plan our trips around at least one night's stay with parking while we're gone.  The rooms are great, well furnished and clean, with beds that really let us sleep well.  There are two meal options downstairs, both of which have good food at a reasonable price.  The staff is friendly and accommodating from the front desk to bell services to food and housekeeping.  The hotel is close to LAX, with free shuttles that run between the hotel and the airport.  Dropping off and picking up your car is easy.  The hotel has become such an integral part of our travel plans that we're almost disappointed when we find a trip;5
The hotel is convenient not only to the airport, but to the business community as well. The staff is friendly, helpful, and efficient. The rooms are well maintained and the beds are very comfortable. The restaurant and bar have a good variety that is well priced. If you are a beer lover, tey have more varieties than you can count. The room rates are very reasonable, especially for the location.;5
I had a terrible experience in Four Points in LAX. I traveled for the labor day holiday to LA and booked a  2 queue size bed nonsmoking room. And when I arrived at the hotel, the assigned me a room in 9 floor first, but I found that room has already taken by others when I open the door, it is really embarrassment. I went down stairs and complain with the guy in front desk, they reasigned my another room. And that room has only one king size bed, this room is completely different from what I booked! Anyway, the worst management and worst service I have even encountered in my life. I would suggest you not to book this hotel anymore!;1
We slept there for a night, before flying home from Los Angeles. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It seemed like the hotel could use some ekstra elevators and some ekstra treadmills, because there were always people waiting to get on both. The room was very nice, and had the prettiest mirror over the sink. Perfect for putting on makeup! The hotel buffet was ok, but nothing special. We had a good nights rest and took the airport shuttle from the hotel the next morning.;5
I stayed here with my wife and children one night in order to catch an early flight the next morning.  The hotel was about what I expected in terms of room quality and service but what I did not expect was an instance of great customer service.  A hotel employee named Musie came to pick up my bags early in the morning.  We had a problem with my 3 year old and he waited patiently for 10 minutes often offering to help. He then not only waited for us to check out but carried our bags clear across the entire back lot and loaded them into my car.  I love great customer service and always feel the need to point out instances where I feel I am getting 5 star treatment. Thank you to this hotel employee.;4
We stayed in 2010 and we decided to come back for one night as we had to take an airplane in the early morning.  The check-in was fast and after that I could return the car to Avis that are located in the same street.  The rooms are fine with very comfortable rooms. The bathrooms are a little bit old but at least they are clean.  We had dinner in the bar and the food was tasty with very friendly staff (also speaking spanish)  If we come back to LA and have to stay in the airport, we will come back for sure.;4
The Four Points Sharaton hotels are the best hotels I have ever been to. When I first visited the hotel it was because of the great location. Then it became routine and the hotel became familiar and unusually comfortable.From the service to the pool everything in the hotel was excellent. The hotel was so satisfying whenever I travel I look for a local Four points Sharaton.;5
Cliff's notes: super deals for flights out of LAX, especially if you are catching a red eye to east coast, see if they still have the 24-hour Check-in promo (they do as of this writing). Stay away from the horrible central tower, room numbers from about 32 to 59 or so. Other towers are just fine.  The perfect:  The 24 hour  check-in promo, still available on the hotel's web site as of this writing (Aug, 2011). If you have a red eye flight, you can check in for 24 hours, so you can check out not at noon on the day of the flight, but at 9pm for instance. It requires you to check in at 9pm or later the day of your check-in.   This was absolutely unbelievable: I didn't need to check out in the morning, could work in the office all day on Friday, get back to the hotel around 8pm,;5
"I was happy with the great location, especially since my car rental was across the street. The lobby and exterior looked great, especially for the price. My room, however, was average at best. My toilet had a major leak, which I discovered in the morning. With all that said, I've stayed at three other hotels near LAX. All three were substantially higher in price and really not a great deal better. All these hotels near LAX are older and even with the ""renovations"", do not reach the desired level of comfort. So for a short business trip to LAX, I would recommend this hotel over the others.";3
The staff made an effort to make me felt known and welcome. Everyone was super friendly and helpful.;4
"Walking into the lobby of the hotel is fantastic; it is a beautiful lobby with staff available to help with luggage. The people at the front desk are very helpful and friendly, providing awesome service. We got a room in the west tower and headed up to the 9th floor with our luggage only to walk into a hall that smells like must, bad eggs and old chinese food. The carpets are stained and peeling off the floor in some areas. The smell of must and stained carpets continue into the rooms though the sheets and bathrooms are clean.  This is not the kind of quality we have come to expect from the Sheraton hotel and while the prices may be cheap, one could easily stay at a dingy motel and get the same kind of room.";1
Stayed for one night and was upgraded to a nicer room which offset the bite of a $19 self parking fee.   Friendly staff, quick check in and out.  Spacious, clean room with flatscreen TV, soft linens and towels with workspace and small refrigerator. The pool area is sunny and draws a crowd.  While acceptable for me, the parking does require a hike around the back of the hotel and up a long ramp. While security and lighting is in place, those uncomfortable with such an excursion after dark might want to consider the valet parking for $27.  Did not have meals at the hotel.;4
"We stayed at this hotel last week with our family .Their carpet in the hotel lobby and even room needs to be replaced ,room looks so dull and unclean. They have kept their front desk very clean and neat but that is just show off...I checked in to my room at 2 Am in the morning...and then i saw my AC is broken I called front desk and she said that she will said Engineer...at 2 am in the morning...come on ;)...I am a human being and I sleep in the night...I had to argue her...to get a separate room key....In all I would say that is the worst hotel I had ever booked,,,,,and I am not going back....";1
"I have never written a review for a hotel before - but wanted to share that this hotel was really great for us. We stayed in the central tower and our room was clean and comfortable. The maid was so gracious and greeted us with a hearty ""HELLO"" when we passed her in the hallway. The desk staff was very accomodating and met all of our needs. The Guest Services staff were always helpful and kind. Everyone was so nice. Jesus in the restaurant and Elmo at the bar were really great! Most importantly, I slept well. I usually wake up in hotels because I'm a light sleeper, but I never heard anything that woke me up like doors slamming, or toilets flushing or people talking! It felt like we were alone there, but the hotel was very busy. The pool (although we didn't swim in it) was warm";5
Wish I could give it 6 stars! The hotel is so good that it took us by surprise! It’s 5 star comforts in a 3 star price and the location could not be better! The General Manager, Phil was very generous to send us a ‘welcome card’ along with complementary beer and snack. There was a little confusion where we thought that the breakfast was included in the rate and even though it wasn’t, he was very sweet to provide us with complementary coupons. You get treated like royalty by each and every staff member and they really go out of their way to make sure that you’re comfortable. Maria at the Bar was very kind to cater to our needs with a terrific smile. I just cannot say enough words about this place here. The Brewster’s and Pool Bar are amazingly good. The rooms are very clean and;5
Just the first stop on a two week vacation, motorcycling thru the northwest.  Started in LA and traveled thru Cali, Nev, Utah, Idaho, Mont, and into BC, Canada.  Wonderful way to start a 2600 mile bike trip.  Everyone was cordial and very helpful.  Celine and the gang in the bar would make any trip worthwhile.  Attitude and courtesy were exceptional.  Recommend stopping in for any reason you can think of!!!;5
The rooms here are not top quality - closer to motel standard than high class hotel.  And certainly the bathrooms could be a bit bigger.  BUT for the price I found this hotel was quiet - better than other hotels in the area! - the rooms reasonable for an overnight, and the food in the restaurant was great.  The best part was the extra effort they went to to get me early access to a room.  I requested early check-in as I was arriving at about 9am and they had sorted it out without any hassle.  Free access to 15 mins of internet time topped it off.  Free scheduled shuttle from the airport was a major plus - better than being stuck having to call and wait for a pick-up.  Overall - I'd stay here again.;5
I didn't want to pay too much for hotel and since we went during Memorial Weekend, everything was just about pricey or sold out of rooms.  There's not much jazz to this place.  There's no extraordinary view.  Our room faced the front, so we can see the rental cars pulling our and being returned.  The outdoor pool are is nice to sit out, but we didn't have time to relax around.  The room was comfortable and spacious.  The bathroom felt very sterile and not updated, but it was stocked with the amenities you need and clean.  The bathroom was spacious though.  Complimentary Nestle water was great.  They have a huge empty fridge for you to stock your own items.  The staff were all helpful and casual/laid back.  The place is always bustling with people.  They have a lot in the back,;3
The accommodations were meticulously clean and well-decorated. The service staff I spoke to were employees here for more than 20 years, and were very friendly and helpful, like Miguel in the restaurant, and Estela, who provided service to the conference I attended.;5
The rooms are a bit tired but likely similar to other LAX area hotels and good for the price plus the staff are extremely friendly, helpful and service minded. Good pool and good location if you want LAX. Also excellent selection of local beers on tap at good prices. Make sure to checkout the wednsday special at the pool if possible.;4
Stayed before heading back home to NZ. Great links to airport and near the hire car places. Good pool, clean with nice friendly staff. Would use it as a starting or finishing point of a US trip anytime.;4
Stayed here before a trip out of the country and used Starwood Points.  Needed to leave my car.  The staff there was very helpful in arranging for me to leave my car at the hotel while I was gone.  The room was great-clean, well appointed, and cozy.  All the usual amenities that I have come to expect as a Starwood Preferred Guest.;5
We went to LA for business and pleasure. We were pleased to find that the Four Points offered a well appointed room, friendly staff, convenient restaurant and great locale for our quick trip in and out of LA.  We are familiar with many hotels in the Beverly Hills and West Hollywood areas and their rates. Four Points offers an excellent rate without sacrificing amenities.;5
We took advantage of an offer (that was a little hard to track down) but it allowed us to check in for 24 hours irrespective of their usual restrictions. As we were only in LA for 24 hours as a stop over to catch our breath with a toddler before heading to London this was brilliant and we got plenty of sleep.  The room was perfectly comfortable and we appreciated the late bar service for the toddlers food but the rest was incredibly basic and average. Bathroom in particular was quite run down. Breakfast was terrible but again it was included in the price and worked for us.  Was surprised that there was no help with baggage on arrival / departure which would have been useful. Also, we had pre booked a crib for the infant and was advised it would be in the room at check in - it;3
Friendly, staff service was great special mention for Celine, Valerie & Patty exceptional people always happy to see you;5
I was so impressed more than anything with the staff of this hotel. I met Phil Baxter, the GM, at their beer tasting event. He was so friendly and service oriented. Edith at the front desk was so helPful and got my room totally square away. Marcela morales and Maria Gonzales were all smiles and very helpful at the restaurant both times I went to have breakfast. And once in said restaurant Patty was so accommodating and made me feel at home even though she was busy between numerous tables. This attention from top to bottom made my stay so much better.The only drawback I thought was the kind of slow service in the bar.;5
Great place for the price.  My daughter loved the pillows(:  It would be very benifical to guest if you cleaned the windows for better vision(: and cheaper parking...but overall it was amazing(: My family and I will surely stay again(: Thanks;5
As a travel consultant I have stayed here frequently pre or post long flights. When I take groups out this is the meeting  place for my west coast participants.. I've never been disappointed with the hotel's service. Jam Escondido, Ca;4
First, the shuttle to and from the airport is such a great convenience!  Both drivers (to and from) were so friendly and helpful lifting my enormous amounts of luggage that I seem to always have with me.  The check-in process was just as pleasant.  The woman was very sweet and accomodating.  I had been flying all day and she could tell.  My room was not ready yet as it was before 3pm west coast time.  She found me another room, and quickly, which I was very grateful for.  The hotel itself and the rooms were very clean and updated.  The housekeeping staff was extremely friendly as well and went out of their way to find me a shower cap and provide me with additional face clothes and towels.  I ordered room service twice and ate in their restaurant for breakfast twice.  All of the;5
We have been stopping at the Sheraton Four Points, LAX on our way to Hollywood to visit my son, for many years. The staff has always been very helpful and friendly. On occasion we have arrived very late at night and were always pleased to see that Brewsters Bar and Grill was not only open but served delicious food and drinks at very reasonable prices. In addition, they remodeled this restaurant and it now has  little nooks and crannies for you to sit and relax in.  If you have AAA you can get a great rate that includes a great buffet breakfast at their Comfort Restaurant.  Refrigerators are in the rooms, with a free bottle of water and most important, very comfortable beds. Add all that to a newly renovated pool and  free use of thier computers and we will definitely stay there;5
The service was excellent and the room was very clean and outstanding.  Parking is a little confusing on arrival, but once you find the parking entrance, it's easy.  They are working on improving it though so it will be easier to see.  It's a great place to overnight if you have a flight the next day.  Easy getting on their shuttle to LAX.  We spend a few days in Santa Barbara and have to fly into and out of LAX and use a rental car.  It's so much easier to check into this hotel, then return the car a night earlier and avoid to early morning traffic.  All rental car agencies are within walking distance to the hotel.  A 10 to 15 minute walk at the most.;5
"In LA on business. After flying all day, checking into my hotel, heading straight to a meeting, returning to my room - I was pleasantly surprised to find the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in while visiting LA - and I've slept in some of the ""best"" hotels.  FourPoints by Sheraton is certainly at par with the 5-star hotels when it comes to service and a comfortable night's sleep.  Save your money, you will not compromise QUAILITY - next time you're in LA, stay at the FOURPOINTS by SHERATON LAX; you will be amazingly surprised!  I'll be back!";5
Since moving to Saint Johns Florida 6 years ago (Mar 2005) whenever we fly to California specifically Los Angeles to visit Family and Friends in Orange, Riverside and Los Angeles Counties, we have stayed at least one night at the Four Points LAX.  The staff has always been very good.  We have enjoyed the service and cleanliness of the Hotel.  I would recommend it highly. Being a member of Starwood Preferred Guests is also a plus. Thanks DP Saint Johns, Florida;5
I stayed at this property late July for business and couldn't have been more pleased.  The staff at the front desk was very professional and knowledgeable.  This property is a no nonsense hotel with all the amenities that one needs to conduct business.  The breakfast was fast and offered options of both a buffer or off the menu items.  The lobby is abuzz with guests using the computers and/or meeting and greeting that keeps the place hopping.  The lobby area overlooks the outdoor pool that was well attended while I was there.  This location has a handy shuttle service to and from LAX.  I never had to wait more that 10 minutes or so in either direction.  This property has two towers.  In the tower closest to the main entrance the rooms are more fresh as they were updated with new;5
we usually do not order room service because of how expensive and banal the good usually is, but since we were getting a 50% discount, we decided to try it out. It was some of the best food we have had in a long time. Worth every penny.;4
Had a wonderful stay and was pleasantly surprised.  Some of the previous reviews proved not to be the situation when I recently stayed at this hotel. Will definitely stay again.;5
One night stay before leaving LA.  Clean rooms, good bedding.  In-room frig was helpful.  Reception was very pleasant and helpful to provide connecting rooms in the West Tower.  Fun to watch the planes coming in for a landing, but no noise to bother our sleep.  Hertz rental is 3 blocks away and provided a ride back to the hotel, allowing us to use the free shuttle from the hotel in the am and eliminate hassle of car rental return in am.  Took the $5 per person shuttle to Manhattan Beach for a great sunset on the pier and a great dinner at Mangiamo's.  At great ending to our week long vacation.;4
I have often stayed at 4 pts because of the convenience to the airport, shuttle service etc. but this time I was really Wowed by the updated decor and friendliness of the staff as well as their extra efforts to perform good service.  Will always be my first choice when I return too LAX!;5
The overnight stay was perfect for everyone prior to flying home. The grandkids loved the pool and the hotel staff was great to everyone in our group.;5
Had an awesome stay at the Four Points by LAX.  Not only did the GM engage me on Twitter, but he sent up a nice welcome gift to my room.  First class!    The hotel is clean, the staff is helpful and the location is perfect.    I will be back!;5
Close to LAX, good menu, great room, excellent beer selection, great service and nice beds!;5
Service was poor from the check-in staff, rooms were not all that clean and very dated. On the plus side, it's location is convenient with the free shuttle bus, and is also quite cheap. We took advantage of their 24 hour check-in policy which was convenient for our stopover.  If you are looking for somewhere for a short stopover, the Four Points does the job. For anything else, I'd be looking elsewhere.;3
What a great staff.  I stay at this property at least 10x per year.  I am arriving or departing from LAX on early morning flights, and I have learned that it is much more comfortable to stay the night before a 7 or 8 am departure, than to brave the 405 at that hour.  The hotel staff (especially the very attentive Front Desk Manager, Justin Jaramillo) have come to know me - always, always with a recognizing smile.  Justin has my room ready at any hour of arrival....what a godsend he has become.  Being an SPG Platinum member definitely has it's advantages, but I always see that Justin and his team welcome all guests in the same manner as they do me.  The hotel is clean, efficient and warm.  The rooms are always ready, and the beds very comfortable.  Even after all these years of;4
This place is a great option for anyone travelling to and from LAX. Front desk staff is helpful and delightful. Juan is one of the clerks that get my vote! Keep up the great job guys!;5
When it is necessary to overnight at LAX we can always rely having a comfortable stay at this hotel.  It's also a well located hotel for visitors to LA's west side, only minutes away from the beaches and shopping without the beach-side prices.  We are returning guest and will be back again.;4
I stayed for a week and I would say that the hotel is disapointing... carpet stains, very noisy and old air condicion (it is a big device near the window, makes a lot of noise and keep turning on and off....) I had to turn it off to sleep because of the noise... Hotel decoration is old, few TV channel options, the parking is very expensive and the internet connection gets very slown sometimes..... I have chose the hotel by the location and price, but it does not worth what they charge... based on what i experienced here should be easy to find something better nearby Avoid at all cost rooms near avoid the vending machines and ice makers, because they are very noisy, i have noticed the noise on the corridor while waiting for the elevators, very loud;2
I discovered the 24hr check-in/out program on an earlier Trip Advisor review and Four Points LAX ticked all the boxes for our last night in the USA.  We didn't have to wait long for the free shuttle from the airport, arriving at the hotel late in the evening. Check in staff were polite, and the room was clean, comfortable and well equipped. With our 24hr check-in/out, we enjoyed a lovely day at Santa Monica (thanks to the helpful advice of guest services staff), returned to our room for a shower and dinner, then caught the shuttle back to the airport for our late night flight home. Our stay was very pleasant and stress free with no concerns about where to leave luggage etc, and we were very pleasantly surprised by the lack of aircraft noise. Well done Four Points!;5
The sheets were not soft at all. We iched all the time we were there. Sorry but I will not stay at your hotel again;1
I Chose the hotel due to the location to Lax Airport.  They had a shuttle bus to provide us to the hotel that was a plus. Got there the hotel entrance was beautiful the front desk service was fast no long wait.    The room was nice and large plenty of space my room was the king size standard the bed was fresh the pillows was fluffed I like there was no old hotel smell which is great in my book. The Bathroom was nice and clean no odd stains Lol TV with basic channels.  For dinner we went the the hotel cafe the food was good no complaints except for the couple making out in corner it's LA.  The hotel was a good experience I'm still new to TripAdvisor so I must start taking pictures so please forgive me. But overall I will stay there again........;3
We stayed at the Four Points LAX when waiting for a connection to an International flight out of LAX. The shuttle service was shared between the Four Points and another property nearby. Even at 11 PM and 11 AM (times we used the shuttle), the buses were PACKED and only came every 20-30 minutes. Be ready to wait for an extra shuttle if you're towards the end terminals at LAX!  Now onto the hotel itself- The lobby was nice enough, there's a restaurant, bar and a gift shop. The restaurant that we had planned to eat at had closed  earlier and the gift shop was also closed. This left us pretty much one option as far as food- room service. There aren't any other food options within walking distance except a Burger King down the road, so keep that in mind. The room itself left much to;2
Business required a layover at LAX, so I chose the Four Points Sheraton (Gold SPG member). The hotel has recently undergone a renovation and it's well worth checking out. The rooms are fresh and the beds are comfortable. The room is large and roomy with plenty of plug ins at the work station for all your portable devices. The bathroom layout is a different than the typical hotel, but it's quite refreshing. Did not have a chance to check out the pool, but there are cabanas available. No opportunity to check the restaurants wither.;4
Got stranded in LAX overnight because of a United Airlines induced debable (but that's another long story) and needed somewhere to land for a day. Called Starwood and they booked me into the Four Points LAX. Never stayed at a Four Points before but I'm not sure I really get the concept. What's it trying to be? A Hampton Inn/Holiday Inn Express rival or something in between that and a 4/5 star? Really not sure.  The hotel is old and the room was spacious (enormous actually) but a bit tired. Room facilities were 2-3 start level. No fridge. Very basic. Bed was firm and comfortable but the pillows were too soft and no pillow options where given. Soft or soft. Managed to get comfortable and had a great night's sleep however.   Good breakfast at a reasonable price, and the pool area;3
Our company had two seminars at this location in March 2011. From the very first contact until the last guest left all Sheraton employees were at their very best-and that's putting it mildly... The catering manager Eden is a blessing - our events were perfect till the last minute. She would anticipate our needs and proactively suggest various options until we found the perfect fit. We were treated with so much care, so much attention and everywhere we turned found only perfection. At the end of the day- when it was all over and we wanted to go sightseeing, they went out of their way to find us a rent-a-car after we were turned down by all airport rental places. This place works like a well organized bee hive - smooth, on time, as promised-just perfect. I would HIGHLY recommend;5
I had a great stay at the four points. The first room they gave me was an indoor room, king side bed, where u had to way out into the hall way and look out a window to see outdoors it was terrible. I didnt like the room at all because, I felt like I was closed in. So I called and ask for another room facing the pool (inside room on 6th floor) .when u look out the window you saw the swimming pool!! It  was great and so much bigger then the other room. I didnt eat there , there where other places around the hotel to eat that was a lot cheaper. Parking was 10 dollars a day with my discount. The rooms were very nice and clean, quiet. .. I allowed them to clean the room daily and they did a great job. I love my stay at the 4points sheraton.;5
Very disappointed that when we arrived after a very long drive, our room was not ready even though it was 9:00 pm. We left to return our rental car, adn when we got back the room was still not ready, now it was 10:00pm and we moved to a different room.  The room also smelled like someone had been smoking in it prior to our arrival before being changed.  Also dissapointed to find out upon check-in, that because we booked thru Hotels.com we would not be credited for the room night or recieve SPG points. This is one of the main reasons we chose this hotel for our stay at the airport.;2
Amiable staff, I had to make a trip to San Diego so being near to the airport suited me very well. The rent a car vis a vis  the hotel was very helpful either. I was very pleased with the hotel in general.;4
"My husband and I came here on a 2 day layover from west coast Michigan to Tahiti for our honeymoon in July of 2011. We were expecting a dump for the low price we paid but were pleasantly surprised. The room was standard... Nothing special but not bad either. Exactly what we expected for the price. Our expectations in service, however, were far exceeded. The staff was so nice and helpful. The girl at the front desk recommended a car rental place that was within our budget and told us exactly what we needed to know. The hotel bar ""brewsters"" is awesome! They feature over 100 beers and the staff sought out my husband and I at the pool to bring us complimentary champagne paired with a gift and card signed by the entire staff! The photo frame they gave us is very cute and we cant";5
I was amazed by the way the hotel help made me feel so comfortable.  They were very courteous from the valet to the waiters & waitresses.  We were very fortunate to be served by a waitress named Estela Estrada, who totally went out of her way toserve us and was very helpful.  I wanted to make sure I wrote this review to let the hotel know that their service is excellent by outstanding employees such as Estela Estrada.    I would definately return back to this hotel and recommend it to all my friends and family, even strangers.  Thank You!;5
This hotel is a good value if you need something close to LAX before a flight. My only complaint was safety, as they put both myself and another peer near exits. As a single female, being in an outside room next to the exit is the least safe room location.;4
This is a good hotel for a stopover, close to the airport with a free shuttle.We stayed there for a two night stopover, its close to the LAX transit centre for buses and about a 20 min walk to the supermarket.  Its very comfortable and i really liked staying there. Only problem I had is the clock was wrong which I didnt realise, i woke up at 8am and it said it was 2am, which caused a slight problem but i should have checked it was right when i got there.  Other than that would recommend.;3
There was a 19 dollar parking fee assessed that was not noted on Priceline when I booked.  The room had multiple holes in walls that were poorly filled in. There is a picture or mirror missing from a wall.  The bedding was worn out.  There were enough towels for 1 person.  The towel rack was mounted to the wall on a slant.  There is a water mark on the ceiling above the bed.  Stay at the super 8 LAX...it's cleaner, cheaper, nicer with free parking and breakfast!;2
"THe Hotel was just what we were looking for to make an 8:15 AM flight out of LAX to Hawaii. The appointments were great the shuttle got us there on time. The Conceirge was nice enough to suggest returning our rental car on arrival so we did not pay for the fairly high self parking charges. The Restaurant on premises ""Comfort"" I would not recommend";4
The worst hotel to date. We spend 140 nights a year and never again a this place.   30 minutes to check in not acceptable for this starwood gold.  No toilet paper and what appeared to be black pubic hair all over the uncleaned room.   It it were not for the fact we were only there for 7 hours we would of requested a room change or another hotel.   Vile and not the usual four points standard that's for sure.;2
"As a Starwood Preferred Guest, I received customer service above and beyond the call of duty from two phenomenal employees---Juan and Martin...they bring back the true meaning of exceptional ""customer service.""    The room service food was well-priced, delivered promptly, and tasted delicious!  I wanted a hotel that was totally nonsmoking and no pets.  I had an appointment at UCLA and traveled the extra distance from UCLA  to stay at this hotel, based on the recommendation of a very valued friend.  Four Points did not disappoint....well worth the extra travel time.";4
Having stayed at this hotel a few years ago, with vaguely positive recollection about it, I figured I'd book it again for a one night stay for business this month.  Maybe my memory is faulty, or more likely, the hotel has gone down hill ... a lot!  When I checked in, I was given a room in the back building, which requires a walk through the ballroom area to a very remote bank of elevators.  No big deal, but that building seems to have been annexed onto the main building (because the upper floors don't line up.    Perhaps the distance from the main building is a problem for the housekeeping staff, because when I got there (to a very hot room), the bathroom was short some towels and soap, and worse, there was a wet dirtly towel lying on the desk!!  So, frustrated (and not wanting;1
We usually stay at the Westin or Sheraton Gateway.  Chose this hotel for the 24 hour check in check out that they offer.  The email address for the 24 hour check in that they had on the web site was not working.  I walked over from the Sheraton Gateway and spoke to a lady at the front desk and explained that I will be checking into the hotel 10  days later and would like to make use of it.  She initially insisted that the email address worked and that I should use that.  I explained several times that I had been trying for several days but it was not working.  She took my reservation number and made a note in the system.  When we checked in 10 days later at about 10.30pm I advised the front desk person that I will be checking out at 6.30pm.  She said that I could not check out;1
Rafael my server at the bar was the best he was very knowledgeable and professional!!!;5
I have been going down to southern California to see my daughter for five years, and I had my worst hotel experience at the Four points Sheraton in LA. On this trip both my 17 year old daughter and my 8 year old daughter were with me. When we checked in, the women who helped me negatively noted that I had booked with a third party (Price line), and then proceeded to treat me like garbage. When I requested a double bed in our room, I was told none were available, and no alternative solution was offered. When I called to the front desk to request a fold down bed, the same women who checked me in answered the phone, and she told me that it might not fit, and that she would have to check with housekeeping. The woman at the front desk immediately called back and informed my daughter,;1
Nice hotel and they treat me well but parking rates there are ridiculous - $19 a night as of July, 2011.;3
This is my first trip to US and given the fact that all Starwood hotels in Downtown LA were fully booked. I've decided to choose Four Points by Sheraton over Sheraton Gateway and The Westin LAX. Although I could get a much lower corporate rate for Sheraton Gateway and The Westin LAX, yet I chose to stay at Four Points by Sheraton because I have never stayed in a Four Points by Sheraton hotel before and I wanted to experience it. It was a risk choosing the hotel since my stay duration was for 6 nights.   My check-in was fast and done in less than 5 minutes, the front desk guy could consider putting on a smiling face though. After enduring a 31 hours flight, I didn't bother to take note of his name.   I was given room no. 213, which is facing Airport Blvd. First impression upon;5
Stayed here during the middle of the week for one night before flying out in the morning.  The hotel is average at best, even for a Four Points.  My room was supposedly remodelled but only the bathroom appeared new (and was quite nice) but the rest of the room did not seem new at all.  Also, there should be an entrance from the back of the hotel so that if you park you don't have to walk around to the front.;3
This is my third stay, at the Sheraton Los Angeles. I had a very quiet and comfortable night stay. In addition I feel that the rooms are extreamly clean, and was very satisfied with the shuttle and the park & ride rates. I have stayed at many hotels near LAX over the years and have decided that this is my favorate.;5
It was a good hotel. We were traveling in a group and our room was on the newly rennovated side of the hotel. Our friends were in the older part and they ended up moving with us as they didn't love their room as much. Our room however was spacious and very clean. The staff was polite and overall it was a nice hotel to stay in for one or two nights. Keep in mind breakfast and parking are additional charges here so I would recommed the Ihop down and around the corner in the mornings.   Would visit again if needing a room nead the airport for late or early flights.;4
Didn't like dungeon door which led us to the enclosed old motel patio.;2
Requested a king bed but was given two full size beds. Me and my wife had to sleep  separate. Also our only window faced the hallway. I had to pay for parking.  Not cool. Will not be staying there again.;2
This Hotel was a great transit hotel.   The room was clean, tidy, there were 2 beds in the room and they were very comfortable. The Bathroom was clean and fresh with toiletries provided.    Downstairs was a very nice comfortable bar/restaurant area the range of beers on tap were very good and the food was very enjoyable.    There was a free shuttle to and from the airport..   We had to checkout at 11am however our flight didnt leave until some 12 hours later and the staff at the hotel kept our luggage until later in the evening and we utilised the free shuttle back to the airport to get on the subway and go to Hollywood for the day then returned back to the airport onto the shuttle back to the hotel picked up the luggage and back to the airport in the shuttle.   We would;4
We had a great time! When we arrived to the Four Points by Sheraton, we encountered a little mix up. We where given a room that was ironically our telephone area code back home. Room 415.   Unfortunately when we went up to our room, our room was not available. A do not disturb sign was dangling from the door nub. Tiered and exhausted from our long drive from San Francisco, we where not looking forward in speaking with anyone from the front desk but within minutes a very helpful and professional young women fixed everything for us.   We reserved two rooms that night and stayed for two nights. I wish I could remember her name. Her smile led up my soul.;4
"so I got there and was ""checked in "" by someone who did not know what he was doing. he asked for my address and other personal information and then took my credit card. we were then sent to the Incorrect room and was embarrassed to find someone was actually staying in the room he sent us to. we then had to go back to the desk where they took my credit card again and tried to 'correct' the check in and compensate the embarrassment by giving us a free breakfast...  finally got to my room after having to pay for parking because they wouldn't help with that either and then was greeted by a shower that wouldn't drain...great.... oh and the toilet wouldn't flush right... what a joke  steer clear from this place. they screwed up my check in and didn't do anything to help and just put";2
On the first night my room was double booked and we had a hotel guest coming to our door trying to get in. On second night we came back to our room made up, very clean, but ac on full blast to an uncomfortable level.  Finally parking was $19 a night which I think is highway robbery,.;3
"As a Starwood preferred guest, I've stayed at this property multiple times, and every time I had a great experience!  I came to expect indifference in big impersonal airport hotels, but  this property really stands out because of caring and professional staff members. For example, not only an amazing conceirge Tereza Martinez arranged a car to take me and my Mom to the restaurant to celebrate her 78th birthday; she even found a vase for the bouquet I got for my Mom, and helped us with the bags turning down a tip. Now,this is really hard to come by in LA! The room service got us some dishes even though they were  listed outside the regular breakfast/dinner hours. Cleaning ladies did an outstanding job on our room as well. Our room had super comfy beds and a great shower - two";5
This is our 3rd time staying here, and we have enjoyed it every time. Four Points makes it very easy: you can be in your hotel room 20 minutes after you get your luggage! The pool area is nice, restaurants serve good food, and everything is good value. We walked one block to catch the trolley bus to Manhatten Beach, and enjoyed a wonderful afternoon out at the ocean. We felt safe at all times. We highly recommend Four Points LAX!;4
We stayed at the Four Points for only one night because of an early flight out of LAX and their park and fly.  Nice hotel..rooms were great, confortable beds, very clean.  Loved the idea that when we returned from our trip, we hop onto the shuttle back to the hotel and get our car and then home.  Park and fly was very convenient and we would definitely do it again.  The only comment that I would make is if you are traveling in a large group (we had 15) remember to allow enough time for the hotel shuttle.  The shuttle goes to other hotels and we found that the shuttle was full the two or three times it stopped at the Sheraton.  Finally one of the hotel's staff called for an additional shuttle and he (I wished I remembered his name..funny man) personally helped us on the bus;5
Nice staff but, man, this hotel smelled horrible.  The lobby was fine, but our floor and room smelled like they used to be smoking rooms or something.  The night before we'd stayed at a Westin in Pasadena and really missed it.  We won't be staying at this Sheraton again (only because of the smell)...;2
Good service, clean room, quiet.  They state the shuttle bus runs every 15 minutes.  We had to wait 30 minutes at 5 am.  It did show up with a bus full of people.  Best to expect a wait of 30 minutes in the morning.;3
We had a pleasant and warm welcome by front office personnel. I asked the receiving executive to check double queen bed instead of king bed, no problem I got it instantly. The room is spacious and clean and at the price I paid this is good deal! ! I attended my daughters graduation at Staples Center and drop her at LAX the following day. It's so convenient and a lot of fast food within the hotel vicinity. Kudos to the housekeeping staff, my daughter was frantic upon discovering she lost her Nokia cellphone. To our surprise housekeeping personnel kept it and give to us when we return. It's hard to find a genuine service this days. Love this hotel ! !;4
"The entire hotel staff appeared to me to have always had a ""ready to serve their customers"" attitude or approach on the very top of their minds and efforts = 100% of the time.";5
Before I begin, I want to state that I have pictures that I took to prove what I am writing about as I was disgusted. There were stains all over my floor carpeting. I was in Room 960. In the hallway, there were dirty glasses on a table as you exited the elevator which remained for hours and hours. In addition, and this was the most disgusting, as I exited my room for dinner, there was a toilet seat and lid leaning against the hallway next to one of the rooms. I complained to the front desk and said that I was appalled that this happened at a Sheraton. He replied that it was NOT a Sheraton... it was a Four Points. Huh? He then told me that he would send up a complimentary breakfast voucher!!!! He told me he had no other rooms to offer me except for one, and I would surely not;1
The thing that stood out above all else was the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff.  Anytime something was wrong or I needed help, they all jumped to the task.  The bed was comfortable, too.  The shuttle service to and from the hotel was great.  I didn't have to worry about a cab.    My only comment would be to the hotel and all hotels, they need to provide a mirror so we ladies can see the back of our hair when trying to fix it!  Otherwise, it was a pleasant stay.;5
This hotel was in a great location-close to the airport with frequent transportation to/from- rooms very clean and modern- staff was very friendly and knowledgeable- had good amenities- and most importantly was reasonably priced;5
I live in the Central Coast of Calif. I needed to take my daughter to LAX. She was going to China and her plane left at 1:30 AM. I also had 2 of her friends who had just finished a 2 week visit. They were leaving at 6:30 AM. To top it off I had another daughter returning from Mexico the next day.  My hotel experience was crucial to my surviving this hectic trip.  Four Points Sheraton LAX was wonderful. Their accommodations were relaxing, the beds comfortable and room service tasty. Try the Chipolte Hamburger! They graciously  accommodated my extra requests. I am definitely returning to the Four Points Sheraton LAX!!!.;5
We are Starwood Preferred guests and always get generous rooms on the 6th floor even tho' we pay with Amex points. We are treated as special guests and sometimes you even give us cookies - but not this last time.  In fact, we missed them.  Internet connection usually fails to work, however, so it is impossile to do any work or use my computer. YOu might want to find a new ISP;5
"I stayed at this hotel for training with my organization.  The front office staff was wonderful; Adam was very helpful in helping us find great local places to have dinner.  Being part of the Food and Beverage industry as well as being part of a Service Provider Organization, the training that the staff has had in providing great customer service really shines through.  Hats off to the management team and I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for great service at a great price. Cheers!  H. V. General Manager Chef Sodexo Corporate Services";5
My husband and I stayed here on May 1 and May 2 while I was receiving treatment at UCLA Medical Center.  We ate there both days and were very pleased with not only the food, but the staff as well.  The staff was very polite and attentive to anything we needed.  I spoke with the manager, Jose Ortega, to inform him how much we enjoyed our dining experience.  I wish I could remember the name of the busboy who was especially helpful.  Although he was not a waiter, he should be!!!!  Thank you again for making a difficult time better.;5
It,s the perfect hotel for a traveler. If you need to rest or have a perfect situation before a long trip, this is the perfect hotel. Good bed, 120 dollar final price, and very close to the airport. Every 15 minutes bus to the airport. A bit noisy.;4
Bed sheets did not seem clean, had stain on it. Shower towels were awful. Green mold?  Needs to improve on overall cleanliness.;3
It is always a pleasure to return to this hotel. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Rooms have recently been refurbished and the new carpet, paint, furniture, and TWO flat screen TVs (in the suites) are wonderful. Breakfast buffet could use some attention to detail and a better menu but service and comfort are nice. I will return.;4
I travel for work a lot and have stayed at hotels in all price ranges...price is NO indication of quality, strange but true.   Case in point:  The Sheraton Four Points LAX compared to the Hotel W in Hollywood, Four Points, cost per night =  $99, W = $299.  I stayed in both hotels just last week.  The value for that $99 at Four Points was impressive.  Unlike the W, Four Points offers free Internet, free water, free coffee in room and free LAX shuttle.  None of these were offered at the W, Internet was $15 a day.  Four Points beat W with quicker room service with better food and a lower service charge.  Four Points is less than a mile from LAX yet was much quieter than W.  (I had to call four times for neighbors' noise at W, and they never did stop partying).    I had elevator;5
Me and my husband stay at the 4 points at least once a month, we refuse to stay any where else. Fat check in/out, food is good, and service is great.;5
Trish went above and beyond when it came to customer service.  We had a small problem, and she made sure that the issue was addressed, and then went the extra mile to make sure we were happy.  Trish is the type of employee that all hotels would want on their staff.;4
I booked a two day conference for the Western Division Meeting of Duvel USA. Everything about the experience was first class! The rooms were great, the staff were professional and the conference arrangements were exactly what I was looking for.  Phil Baxter (Hotel Manager) and his team provided me with everything I needed to run my event seemlessly. I would have no hestiation recommending this hotel as a great place to hold any kind of business function.;5
"First off, the property is good overall value and very close to LAX. The rooms were pretty nice, restaurant had an INSANE beer selection which I was very pleased with. I stayed 2 nights back-to-back as I had to extend a business trip. The first night I wasn't charged for parking. The second night I was. I spoke to 3 different people about the charge and basically was told ""tough $hit"". If you're going to charge me $19 per night (20% of the cost of the room) for parking, at least be consistent with your gouging. A corporate rate should not include a parking charge, period.";4
We stayed at this hotel for four nights. I would like to say I feel lucky I choose this out of all the choices in the area. It is all good so please read on, I have travelled a lot and felt I should write this.  We was greeted as we entered the doors by staff like we had been there for days already, pointing us in the direction of reception. There was a short line and it seemed an extra staff member was commandeered to lighten the line. The room was clean and the bathroom was large and spotless. The shower was hot every time we used it with what looked like a new showerhead with massage features, Wow the bed was the best it seemed to just relax me to sleep, fantastic. Flat screen TV was a good size. The pool is great and has a brand new bar at the side with a great selection of;5
I stayed at the Sheraton for an extended stay during May & June. I had a room facing Airport Blvd which was very clean, spacious and gave me a view of the sunset. I used all the facilities except for the heath center & airport shuttle. During my stay the hotel was full on several occasions but the staff remained cheerful & helpful throughout my stay. I'm coming back to LA later this year and would not hesitate to stay here again.;5
I landed in LA at 10 AM, had meetings in the area until 8 PM, and flew out the next morning at  6AM, so I needed a place near the airport, and given how little time I was going to be in the hotel, there was really no point in spending a lot of money.   My expectations were pretty low for a Four Points near the airport, but I was impressed with the cleanliness.   For my very short stay I have no real complaints, except that the walls facing the hallway could have been a bit thicker.   I'll probably stay here again for similar less than 24 hour trip.;4
My stay at the hotel was really great i rally liked the service and the people that work there were really polite like trish and juan. in my stays they offered me a great costumer service. i also like the room details and the bottle of water its a great product inside beacuse whan i come i dont have to go buy a bottlle of water right away. thank u for the great service and i look foward staying again.;5
We are Starwood Preferred Guests, having joined when we stayed at the hotel in May.  Unfortunately that was not a great experience as there was a noise in the ceiling all night which made sleep difficult.  We mentioned this on checkout and were told we would be put in an upgraded room on our return in June - which we were - I guess!!  A bigger and more attractive room.  However, it was next door to a locked room (not guestroom) and also backed onto the room where ice and cold drinks were available.  Hence.......very little sleep again.  The noise made it impossible to get a proper night's sleep.  Yes, we should have complained but had come in from a London flight, quickly unpacked (initially thinking the noise was air conditioning, so turned that down), went for dinner and by;2
We had a very comfortable stay at the Four points Sheraton LA airport. The staff was very helpful, and the hotel provided many nice amenities. Would definitely stay there again. Great value also!;5
My daughters school was having a sleep over so my husband and I decided to stay near the school just incase of an emergency so we stayed at this hotel. We had the Jr. Suite, the room was beautifully furnished with 2 flat screens, and refrigertaor and a very comfortable bed. We had such a good time. The staff were friendly and very helpful. I did not get the chance to dine at the resturants but my husband had a few drinks at the bar and he was very happy with the service and his drinks. although we live locally we will definitly stay here again because we really enjoyed ourselves.;5
Judging from the reviews and the Sheraton name, I purposely picked this hotel but was sorely disappointed.  The room that I got smelled like an ashtray upon entering (even though the entire hotel is non-smoking.) I asked to be moved because it bothered me, and the room that they tried to move me to looked like it was in a Motel 6, with a window out into the hallway, so I went back to the original room.  It didn't help that the staff member who was to show me to my room didn't bother to help me with my luggage, and I was struggling to keep up with him as I carried my suitcase and two heavy bags.  The bed was lumpy, the chair had spots all over it that gave me great doubt about the cleanliness of the rest of the room.  The bathroom also was of a motel quality and the air;2
As I am from Myanmar (Burma) and we do not have internationally accepted credit card system. It would be great, if you could let us book and pay by cash. It is inconvenient to ask US residence friends to assist.  But I need more stay to make my comment on your property more accurate.;3
I booked a two queen room online for our stay at the Four Points by Sheraton at LAX.  When we arrived we were the only ones checking in at the time so check in was very smooth.  They had a staff member help us to our room (we had a ton of luggage).  Our original room wasin  a strange older part of the hotel and it was fairly run down.   Also, it had two double beds NOT two queens.  The hotel employee told us he'd wait while I called the front desk and explain the mix up.  I did and they asked me to hold for a moment.  The gentleman came back on the line and said they could give us a new room.  Our new room was much larger and had the two queen beds as we requested.  The room was very nice and clean and in the newer portion.  As the evening went on we were checking the place out;3
"Have always stayed here for ""park n' fly"" - but this last trip will be my last... 1. The quote I got when booking this by phone for one night's stay and parking was $154, when we checked in it was $189. 2 When our sink in the room wouldn't drain (if a maid cleaned this sink, wouldn't she have known this and reported it?) we called maintenance who in turned tried to clear it with a plunger, after black stinky gunk came up and he couldn't fix we were told the only other room available was a handicap room (my husband is 6'1"" so those handicap showers are quite low for him) but what else could we do? I didn't want to brush my teeth in the bathtub... 3. When we arrived back from our trip at LAX it literally took 45 minutes for their shuttle to pick us up - saw the Hilton, Westin,";2
We found this Sheraton to have nice, comfortable rooms with a pleasant bar and pool area. Unfortunately the male bartenders cater to certain favored customers while totally ignoring visitors. We waited for over 18 minutes trying to order a drink while other customers continued to walk up and were greeted by name and served immediately. A new female bartender attempted to assist us but was greatly hindered by the mea, rude attitude and complete lack of assistance from her male co-workers. A manager even assessed the bar area twice while we were waiting and ignored us! Go down the street to have a cocktail!;3
Hotel was fine. Quiet room. I slept well. Good restaurant. However, I used the free hotel shuttle from LAX 4 times during my stay. On 3 occasions it arrived after 30 minutes. The hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport and the shuttle is meant to run every 15 to 20 mins. 35 minutes is a long time to wait after a 12hr flight. You see other hotel shuttles coming by TWICE before the Four Points one. Pity. If the shuttle had been as regular as promised I would recommend this hotel and stay again. As it is, I'll be staying at one of the hotels whose shuttles I saw twice while waiting at the airport. As a note, when I mentioned the shuttle problem politely to two different members of staff, they kind of shunned away from any responsibility and blamed it on the shuttle company and;3
We stayed at four points for 3 nights in a King Deluxe room. From the moment we walked in the room we were impressed. The cleanliness of the room could not be faulted, I have worked in the hospitality industry for many years and this hotel is fantastic, all the staff were very friendly, from check in, housekeeping, restaurant, bar, concierge, EVERYONE! We will make this our hotel to stay at when we come to LA next.;5
The lobby area, pool , and restaurant were very nice. Clean updated and staff very friendly.  Which is why I was so disappointed in my room.  When I entered it I noticed right away that it was dingy and very old.  But it looked clean enough and I was in a hurry to get to a dinner meeting.  First mistake!  I should of slowed down and too a hard look. When i returned at 11 pm and wanted to just go to bed I reliazed how bad the room really was.  The blanket under the comforter was full of holes and there was a big wet spot in the carpet when I got of bed on the other side.  I was so tired I just stripped off blankets and stayed - I didn't want to change rooms that late at night and I was leaving in the morning.  The bottom of my white socks were dirty from walking to to the;2
Not only was our stay at the Sheraton4points pleasant in all ways, it was special, it was our 50th wedding anniversary.  This memorable occasion exceeded all our expectations. The room was clean, comfortable and cozy.  A special thank you to Ciro and Gina, for all the energy put into this memorable stay.  Everyone from the front desk to the maid, provided excellent service and should be commended on a job well done.  Ciro, you are the best!!!!!  Thanks all. A & J Robbins;5
"We have stayed here a couple of times and will continue to stay here.  Our group is always too big for one room so they accomodate us with adjoining rooms.  If youre using the park and fly option you can't beat the price.  It costs as much to park the car for a week as it does to get a room one night and leave the car for a week.  Never have had a problem with car care, as I have at other hotels.  And love to get rooms that allow us to watch all the planes come in.  Don't worry, you can't hear them! The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful.  Front desk checked us in quickly, baggage guy was so funny talking to us about how we had ""just missed the apocolypse.""  We arrived just past 6pm on May 21st! And he also helped us get our airline tickets at the hotel so we could avoid";5
I did the Park Sleep Fly option of getting two weeks of parking and then staying in the room at the end of the trip. The hotel is very nice and convenient to the airport. But it is really beyond my price range. I don't think I can afford to do this again at that price.  The hotel restaurant was especially over-priced. Six dollars for a scoop of ice cream!;4
"Stayed at the hotel before and after my honeymoon cruise.  Upon initially entering the hotel, an employee from the guest services desk almost trips my wife and I.  While I was checking into the hotel, the same guy tries to flirt with my wife (on our honeymoon) and offers to help her with her bags.  Why did he not offer to help when ""we"" were walking in?  A female behind the counter was laughing while watching him in action.  We booked a night city tour through the hotel and asked about options for a ride to the port for our cruise the next day.  The concierge said she would take care of it for us.  She should have told us it was going to cost $70 bucks for the ride instead of us finding out when getting out of the car!  After arriving back at the hotel following our honeymoon";1
Just need a hotel near the airport for our last night in L.A.   It was clean but worn. The  free  shuttle was perfect and the staff was very nice.  The even have a computer and printer in the lobby, so you can print your boarding pass.  Also a car rental across the street.  $100 incl. tax for the night was just fine.;3
I will never be back to this hotel. Aside from the fact I had to pay for cable but was given free internet and bottled water which makes no sense at all, we were charged for other guests room service to the tune of nearly $200. Not to mention we were charged for our entire stay on the first day which left us feeling obligated to stay. I was also a little upset that we had to pay nearly $20/day for parking as a hotel guest but it seemed we always had to park as far away from the hotel as possible. And with a 7-year old spending all day at DisneyLand coming back and walking this distance was practically torture on him. All in all, not a pleasant hotel stay at all. The facilities were nice but sometimes that's not enough!;3
Free shuttle to and fom airport. Large rooms, with twin queen beds,  and large toilet. OK toileteries. Complimentary tea coffee maker in room. Found the breakfast quite good. City tours offer a pick up from the hotel, which is convenient. You can also get the Ocean Express Shutlle nearby (3-4 minutes walk), for USD 5, which allows you to spend a few hours at Manhattan Beach Pier and/or Manhattan Beach Village and/or Plaza El Segundo.  Would return.;4
We stayed at Four Points sheraton for 2 nights before we flew back to Australia. We stayed at one of the renovated rooms which was quite good. However, the bathroom door did not lock. We enjoyed the free internet which was really fast. It was great to have free internet after all the other hotels we stayed on our trip charged exorbitant rates for internet. Parking was a bit expensive at $20 a day.  The check-in and check-out queue was a bit long. I wish there were more staff at the registration desk. Usually there was only one person manning the normal registration area. The room doors make a loud noise and it seems like there were a lot of in and out traffic from rooms. I didn't notice any noise when I stayed at LAX airport marriot. Perhaps we just got a noisy floor or this;4
What was supposed to be a fun weekend started off great but soon after checking in, the service put a damper on my plans.  I am not one to complain but the service that I received at this hotel was beyond what I could take.  I asked for a refrigerator in my room.  The guy checking me in said it was arranged.  An hour later, I was still waiting for one so I called the front desk and when I inquired about the status of the fridge, the front desk said they would check the status (in a very annoyed tone) then hung up on me. Another hour passes and since there were no return calls, I called again and was told me that they were trying to track one down and that I could leave the room and when I returned from dinner, there would be one there.  Returning from dinner, there was still no;1
I've reviewed this hotel before as I've had great service from the front desk.  Since that review, almost all, if not all the rooms in the hotel have been renovated.  I just wanted to update the review with a positive comment about the breakfast restaurant.  Not only was the buffet plentiful and delicious, the service was prompt, efficient and with a big smile.  This time there, I had Marcela.  She is really very nice and always seems to have the biggest smile on her face.  It makes eating there that much more enjoyable.  With that said, everyone there is always very nice and very efficient.  Nice job restaurant crew!;5
As what you would expect from a Four points hotel. Everything you expected from Four points is offered. The shuttle took a mere 5 mins from LAX. Check in was a breeze and although it was rather busy during check-in , they make an effort to attend to SPG elite members first. The rooms were ok, nothing too excited about. There is a nice pool area , a small gym which I never actually used it. Free Wifi throughout the hotel as with all Fourpoints. I sometimes have my parcels shipped and delivered to the hotel in the States and I have to say I'm not the only one but the concierge are very well organized in that aspect.  They did have breakfast at the restaurant for about $15 but we decided not to have it there. This is the 2nd time I've stayed there and I would return if the rates;4
It is always nice to return to a hotel and someone recognize you, address you by name and ask how you have been.  Juan greeted me at the Front Desk as if I was an old friend.  This man is professional, courteous and very helpful.  It was so nice to have someone remember me and make me feel as if he was watching out for me.  When traveling from one coast to the other you are tired and sometimes irritable but a smile and an act of kindness as Juan did made me check my attitude.  Yes I will definitely be returning for the comfortable beds, great food and professional friendly staff.;5
We had an early morning flight and decided to use the hotel's Park-and-Fly package so that our first day of vacation wouldn't have to start at 02:00.  The hotel is in a great spot for this and the tariff for 14 days of parking and a night's stay was less than the price of parking elsewhere at LAX.  However, this is not a comfortable hotel.  Thin walls and mediocre beds make it comparable to a Motel 6 rather than the other Four Points hotels I've stayed at.;3
We needed a hotel that was close to the Airport because of our departure time 7 am. We also like the fact that we could check in when we landed in LA -  We travelled with our Teenagers and got a room with 2 queen size beds - There was no refrigerator or safe in the room which we would have liked to have had - The room was large enough but the bathroom area was small with little privacy - There was also a fee for Parking  The 2 restaurants were fine and there was a pool party on Friday night outside but unfortunately it was very chilly- BIG Plus proximity to LAX;4
I greatly appreciate cheerful and efficient hospitality. Associate Estelle Estrada of the Sheraton is both.;4
because if it was a renovated room they would need to go back to the drawing board.  Room was small and cramped, old TV, tiny bathroom, empry walls and generally depressing room.;2
I took a room for a long layover- the airport shuttle runs continuously so doesnt have to be called and it only stops at one other  hotel which is efficient.The room -nothing special- basic and a little dated but proper blockout curtains so you can rest in the day.The airport hotels are all clustered together in an area devoid of anything other than a few fast food restaurants.I had a breakfast  included package- it was fine but again just what you would expect form an airport hotel. Free internet and boarding pass print facility are good offerings. One of their points of difference is you can book for a 24 hour block of time- great for an early morning arrival from Australia- saves the hassle of trying to negotiate an early checkin.;3
Without question the best value near LAX.   Clean rooms, friendly staff, and perfect location.;5
"1st time to Los Angeles and this hotel was nicely placed. Value was excellent, restaurant and lobby bar was great with excellent friendly staff. Had some free time one night and took a tour of LA ""LA at Night"" tour picked me up right at the hotel. Hotel is located around all car rental drop lots, directly across from Budget car rental and minutes from the airport. Located approximately 20 mins to Venice Beach. Nice outdoor pool area and onsite parking. Would go back for a personal stay based on the great rate";4
With a little advance planning, this hotel is the most reasonably priced and best value in West Los Angeles. Staff at the front desk are well trained, extremely efficient, friendly and always greet me warmly. I have stayed at this hotel off and on for the past 15 years and still see the same faces.;5
After a disasterous stay at Crowne Point with leaking toilet or sink, this was nice. I have no complaints. Linen looked clean and not slept in like other hotel.;3
We stayed in a room facing the street and it was noisy. The restaurant food, service, prices were good.;3
1. Room was musty on arrival,.  2. I was put into a non-starwood preferred room even though I was a starwood preferred.   3. There was a cockroach in the bathroom on day 2 of my stay. 4.  Drawers (really boxes) used for clothes had debris in them.   5. Maid service was late in the day, sometimes the room went unserviced until 3-4pm. 6. Coffee at conference room ran out in the am, and it did not arrive after lunch until right when the session was over.  No cookies were supplied but should supply fruit instead. 7.  Breakfast was extremely expensive, $20 for buffet with tax and tip included.  All us old farts are trying to eat less and expect to pay less as well maybe $7 for some eggs, protein, fruit, and coffee prepared in the institutional fashion as was done in the restaurant.;2
"Overall he hotel is good for being close to LAX but that is about it.  For the money if you stay in the older rooms with the standard TV and almost no extra space beyond the bed...its not much.  Eating at the new restaurant ""Comfort: was  anything but as the exterior doors to the entrance kept letting in cold air drafts that was very unpleasant.  The bar while offering a nice selection was typically over priced.";3
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are set up nice with a work station for business and a nice flat screen TV for relaxing and watching your favorite program.;5
As a regular traveller (and luxury hotel lover) I have stayed at a number of hotels in this area but nothing beats the Four Points. Friendly staff, great service, clean rooms, easy parking, convenient location and great value for money!;5
The Four Points in now my favorite Starwood hotel in the vicinity of LAX.  The renovated rooms are comfortable with refrigerators, new linens, and a tea/coffee maker.  The room rates are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  For elite SPG members, they also provide cookies and grapes as an additional amenity.  The property has improved a lot.;5
The reasonable rooms and parking, plus shuttle to LAX -- so convenient!  Even a room upgrade by being the SPG member.  Would stay again and tell my friends to stay there.;5
"My stay at the Four Points Sheraton Lax was most accomodating, the entire hotel staff from check-in to parking service were very helpful, personable, courteous, and most all, always provided me service with a smile. My room was very comfortable, cleaned everyday ,and unlike many hotels, they provided their guest with a free bottle of water without a price tag attached, I thought that was an additional highlight to my stay, because I love to drink water and think it is very tacky that some hotels charge a guest for such a necessary element.   The hotel is less than 5 minutes away from the LAX; not too far from other locations such as Manhattan Beach, Venice Beach, Santa Monica, and many other locations.   I really like the Starwood program the hotel brand offers, because during";5
a comfortable clean hotel without frills  well located for transit passengers;3
We stay here often as the airport shuttle is so convenient. Our daughter lives in L.A. so we stay here for a night or two when traveling to be with her.  The pool is wonderful and the resturant and lounge are great also.  The rooms are always nice and comfortable. Nice sized bathrooms which you don't always find for sure.  We will continue to stay here when in L.A..;4
As a hotel consultant, I am very leery of where I stay and LAX was not my first choice (even though the conference I was attending was at the nearby Sheraton).  But in this case, I was blown away.  It is a very hip Four Points, reflective of SBE Entertainments success in creating the hottest spots in LA.  Also, it is damn near impossible to find a craft beer in LA, yet Brewster's, the lobby restaurant, has over 100 both regional and from around the world.  This is the standard by which Four Points should grow the brand.  Staff was great and Phil the GM has created a diamond in the rough.;5
I enjoyed my week's stay at the Four Points. It was very close to both the airport and to several car rental places. The hotel as a whole was clean and well presented. The pool area was nice and relaxing. We didn't really eat or drink in the hotel, so I can't comment on food and drink. Service was efficient and friendly.  The room was clean and comfortable and had clearly been recently modernised. We did have an internal window, looking out to the corridor (which then had an external window). I intially thought this would be a problem, but I didn't really notice it at all. We were located at the end of a hallway, so I think that helped.  We used the self park each day, for $19. It was to the back of the hotel and we found it to be problem free.  I would recommend this hotel as a;4
warm people,clean rooms,friendly environment,good food...will patronize another time,keep it up.;5
"What's not to like about the Four Points by Sheraton hotel at LAX? It ticked all the boxes; good room, good service and good value. We especially liked the 24-hour pay and stay option.";5
My recent trip to LA on business was made considerably more enjoyable than expected thanks to the Four Points Sheraton LAX.  Not only did it provide updated rooms and public areas, the staff was on their game as well.  Very friendly and sincere, so hats off for that!  The icing on the cake however is the hotel bar.  I must admit I do like beer but the tap and bottle selection here would make a beer connoisseur giddy.  Certainly not what I expected in a hotel.  Of course, Four Points has attractive room rates, so all in all, an excellent value.;5
"easy access from LAX not a lot of help at reception not a lot of help to move bags room comfortable fan in room unusualy noisy doors to access wings - slam at night wiht a big ""THUD"" blue cheese was salty wow?";3
Hotel and staff were great. Really loved the beer selection at the bar;4
Booked here for a one night layover at LAX.  The good: hotel was clean, furnishings and common areas were in good shape, bathroom was good size and looked recently remodeled, front desk staff was very friendly and efficient, free wireless internet, had a decent bar area with food, price was fantastic (paid $75 for the night). The OK: room styling was a little bland and furnishings were very basic, could not find a light switch to turn on the lights in the room (with exception to the one light by the door) so each had to be turned on manually.  The bad: nothing.  Overall a good stay for an airport hotel.  It's not the fanciest by any means but since the room prices were so cheap I think it's a great option for an overnight stay.;4
Our experience checking in was swift and pleasant.  Our room was very clean, quiet and spacious. Since we were flying out early next morning we weren't able to use amenities provided by the hotel for breakfast.  Would like to note that we booked our room one day too early and were told we couldn't change it. We would have had to pay for another night. I contacted Mr. Baxter's office about this and they were very gracious in waiving the extra night's fee. When we returned from returning our rental car, which was right across the street from our hotel, we found a plate of deli cheese, crackers, grapes, strawberries, along with a kind note from Mr. Baxter thanking us for choosing their hotel. We absolutely would recommend this hotel to anyone choosing to stay close to the airport.;4
I usually don't write these reviews, as I travel for business very frequently, however the Sheraton Four Points LAX was a memorable stay. The property is extremely well designed, comfortable, clean, modern and great friendly staff. The food was very delicious and my favorite part was the incredible beer selection & quality at Brewster's! Racer 5 to start and Old Rasputin to finish...simply great!;5
I stay at this hotel frequently, and appreciate the friendly staff, especially at the check-in counter.   The bar is a nice place to relax, with quite a selection of beer both bottled and on tap (they have a beer-tasting option!).    Frequent travelers/SPG Platinum usually receive a nice tray of cheese and crackers or cookies and grapes.   An excellent value for resting before or after a trip!;5
We lost our keys walking in to the hotel and didn't realize we lost them till it was time to leave. The hotel was able to recover them  and got us on our way on time. That within itself goes a long way to me. Thanks Four Points!;5
The park and stay at Four Points at LAX was perfect for us.  Our flight was early the next day and we didn't want to ask friends to drive us at that time.  We would also have had to have someone pick us up after midnight on our return.  We drove in the afternoon before our flight.  Check-in was a breeze and the hotel made it easy for us to secure a parking spot during our trip.  The room was clean and comfortable.  By staying at the hotel we had an extra hour of sleep in the morning.  We took the complimentary shuttle to the airport and to the hotel on our return.  The entire process was very easy.  We would recommend it to anyone.   The overall price, including the parking, was the best in the area.;5
I have never been disappointed with Four Points by Sheraton LAX.  The service is always good, the rooms spacious and the beds comfortable.  The restaurant renovations were nice but the food just adequate.  However, BREWSTER'S BAR located in the lobby, was fun and on the upside, has over 100 beers from all over the world from which to choose .  Comfort's Restaurant offers a decent - but a little pricey for the cuisine, breakfast buffet as well as a varied dinner menu. There are a few fast food places near by and an adjacent hotel which has a nice restaurant, but if you want to just veg out and stay in, this serves the purpose. My only disappoint this trip was the lack of amenities that I remember from past visits.  The great coffee mugs in the room were replaced by paper cups and;3
Several months ago I had one of the worse experiences at a hotel at the 4 Points Sheraton LAX, I wrote an extensive review then of all the issues.  I was then put into a room that should have been “taken off market” per the hotels GM the original issues with the room included a FILTHY,  moldy gross tub, complete with hairy ceiling and walls, stained and buckled carpet, noisy door, and faulty HVAC.  The GM contacted me apologetic and sent me a certificate for a 2 nights stay in a Jr. Suite for my troubles along with a reward card full of points that will allow me to stay at a discount at another hotel in the Starwood network.  Long story short, months pass and I find myself traveling for business in LA again so I call over and over and over and over again trying to redeem my;2
I highly recommend staying at this hotel, especially if you need to relax after a long flight or getting ready for a long flight.  (We flew from Hiroshima, Japan.)   Close to LAX, quick & friendly got to check in unbelievably early.  Awesome!  Food was good, pool- perfect, housekeeping staff considerate, felt safe.    A high five to the front desk - Thank you Trish!  You were incredibly thoughtful...always was thinking two steps ahead when it came to my children and our travels. A job well done!  Sempre Fi from one mom to another. Thank you for caring.    Warmly,  Jackie Allen;4
Really disappointed that the price has doubled since I was staying there in the fall and winter. The room is very nice, but the huge leap in price is disheartening. The staff is always very friendly, every single person I come into contact with is enthusiastic.;4
I only saw one room, ours, but it was really in need of a thorough cleaning and updating.  The carpet was worn and badly stained.  The bedding had cigarette burns in the blanket, though it was a non-smoking room.  There was no odor of smoke, but the blanket should have been replaced, not reused.  There were few toiletries in the bathroom, including no shower cap.  The people in the hotel were all friendly and the service was good, but PLEASE, just update anda freshen.;3
Comfortable room and very friendly, helpful staff.  If you're a beer lover, you'll love Brewsters.;4
Horrible old room for our family to freshen up prior to flying back to Aus - stayed for 5 hours and hated every minute.  Had a shower and the bath filled up with water while we showered.  The room was very 70ish. As an A 1 member - would not recommend this hotel to anyone!;2
After staying at another hotel near this one previously, I thought I had stumbled upon a bargain finding this place for $40/night less with free internet (by the way, the internet service is pretty fast for a hotel, completely happy about that!) However, I walked in to my room and it sounded like the window was open, so I looked and it wasn't, but after review by hotel staff, it was determined that I should be moved to a different room as their recent renovation hadn't completely fixed the window and it was loose. In this room, the noise wasn't as loud, but the traffic outside is definitely clearly heard, which can be annoying if you have to make business calls from your room. I might try staying here again, but definitely asking for a rear facing room!;3
I have stayed at other Four Points Sheratons with great pleasure. But this one was just disgusting. Nobody attending the front desk... crowded kibby with people watching TV... the bellman was rude, the hallways and rooms were under repair or rennovation... many people trying to switch rooms because theirs, as ours, were horrible. And the manager just said: Sorry, there's nothing I can do. Our room (reserved quite in advance) was in the last corner of the hotel, with a view of the parking lot, small, smelly, with no toiletries. Oh well, I will never stay at another of these htoels in my life. disappointing. I moved to teh Westin.;1
I've stayed here a few times.  It has a slow West elevator that takes eons to move up and down.  It's been renovating now for several years both the bar and rooms.  I like the location near the airport but there are other starwood properties nearby that I will use in the future.  The only highlight for me of this location is the bar that has great beer selections on draft and bottle. The food is typical pub food.  The morning buffet is alright but nothing special. The workout room is tiny but they do have a few treadmills.;3
My family and I had visited the four points Sheraton in the LA last summer. It is a fine place to stay and had no issues during our 3 days there. The room was clean and cozy. The place was quiet and the staff were friendly. I will recommend it to a friend.;4
First let me start with the positives: The airport location is convenient and very good shuttle service. Martin Gil, The check- in clerk was very pleasant and helpful!  The pool area is nice. The negatives: The room was a dump with the only window facing a walkway! We were charged $60.00 for 2 beers and 2 burgers in the brew bar. Do not go there, there are plenty of more reasonable restaurants in the area. The waiter barely spoke English and was very incompetent. The hotel should not charge a hotel guest an exhoribant  $19.00 to park overnight outside.;1
"Returning from Australia to Michigan, arrived at hotel mid-morning, a room was available and we were able to check in immediately.  Bedding was comfortable, noise level was low, and the curtains blocked nearly all sunlight, perfect for recovery from trans-Pacific flight.  Overall clean and tidy; could be improved with a microwave and a better coffee-maker (probably the worst in-room coffee ever).  Shuttle was available when needed, though friends had longer-than-expected wait a few days earlier.";4
To be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot from the Four Points at LAX, but found it to be a clean, comfortable hotel with exceptional service from all the staff we dealt with. Special thanks goes to the customer service staff at the concierge desk and our waitstaff at the restaurants. We stayed in a renovated room (recommended) and loved happy hour at the bar (5-7 daily) after a hard days sightseeing. Food, including breakfast, is basic, plentiful and reasonably priced. If you must have 5 star, don't stay here, but if you want a good hotel with everything you want, it fits the bill.;4
I really like that 4 points is doing the new vibe like the W hotels. It makes the hotel much more appealing!   The beds were super comfortable and you couldn't hear the airport at all. Until 5 am when they started to make breakfast - Then, the fumes were terrible! Also, the music at the pool was pretty loud until midnight.   The valet guys were all very nice. However, the check in desk staff - 3 out of 4 were not so friendly.;4
We found this hotel to be in a great location for our business and tours of Los Angeles! We stayed for nearly a week and the front office manager, Justin, was very gracious in ensuring we were comfortable during our stay.  We also appreciated the help from Jesse in Guest Services in finding our way around the city and seeing the best of LA.  The hotel was clean, the staff was courteous, and we felt valued as guests.;5
"While this hotel is very conveniently located next to LAX, they don't make it easy to get into.  The front entrance was loaded with shuttle buses and inaccessible so we went to the ""self Parking"" area which costs $19 in addition to your room, and you find yourself in the back of the hotel where the dumpsters are.  We went around the very back and there was an entrance marked ""Ace Rental Car"".  One would think it would have the hotel name or whatever.  Anyway, you have to walk through a long corridor to get to the registration desk.  They did send someone with a cart to get our luggage though.  Once we were finally IN the hotel it was okay.  There is a nice pub where we ate dinner the room was clean although the hotel is a bit aged and is showing it.  Bed is comfortable, a bit of";3
This airport hotel is excellent in every respect. The rooms, albeit quite small, are clean and completely sound-proof, a rarity these days. The swimming pool was surprisingly large, well-maintained - and empty! There is a good fitness facility. Dinner was very good and the breakfast buffet was excellent. Service was top-notch. We waited only a few minutes for the airport shuttle. Excellent price, made even better with AAA or senior rates. Be sure to ask! We would certainly stay here again on our way through LAX.;5
The hotel room we stayed at was very dingy and dirty.  The carpet was so stained, it looked so dirty we were afraid to walk around around in our socks.  The chair was also stained and we were afraid to sit on it.  It just creeped us out.  The bathroom looked like it was fixed by somebody who had no idea how to caulk.  The water pipes was protruding out of the wall with a big huge hole.  There was nothing to cover it up.  The tub faucet was  crudely fixed, with warps and bumps.  It was also rusted.  The air conditioning was so loud when it came on, it would wake us up.  We thought we were going to have problems with airplane noise, but instead it was the air conditioning.  It would blow on us and my daughter ended up catching a cold.  Thank goodness we were not there much and we;2
I have stayed at Four Points Sheraton atleast 10 times in the last 2 years and it is by far my favourite place to stay at LAX....  Quality upscalled furnished and renovated rooms await with nice modern fixtures and fittings - staff are wonderfully hopefully particular my two favourite employees JUAN at Front Desk and the lovely Terese at concierge/bell desk  All the staff I have encountered have a great attitude and are always willing to offer assistance. The free 15 mins of internet access per room per day is a bonus too !  Book this hotel and ask for a renovated room for what your paying you wont be disappointed, I never have been !;4
Arrived this morning early helpful front desk took our bags in straight away. Got back room ready and really surprised! Newly renovated, modern, free wi fi, clean, kids already used pool and loved it. Looking forward to dinner as it looks yummy. As i have said above great value and with an overwhelming choice of accomadation around the area I am VERY happy with my choice! The only critic I have is the cost of parking ouch!;4
We stayed at the Sheraton hoping for a upgrade stay.  Stayed at a hotel which was not the Sheraton and known to be a grade down from the Sheraton on our first night and found that the first hotel was much better.  We were told we were in the newly remodeled area.  We felt the cheaper hotel had nicer linens and more room.  My son crawled into bed and the bed was covered in crumbs.  Yes they changed the bed for us, but before so had to see it before changing it.  I don't lie about crumbs in my bed.   Is the Sheraton known for having crumbs in their beds?  If asked if I would stay with you again it would be questionable.....;2
Perfect place to stay if your business venue is here or nearby.;4
The room was satisfactory except that there was no in room mirror. Yes, one in the bathroom, but only the one. I had no access to a full length mirror in that room either. Also, I know lots of people like feather pillows, or really soft pillows, but I didn't like my pillow selection at all.   Service was good. Restaurants were good...bar was slow, main was great, food was tasty.  I am aware that this hotel is old and has been remodeled in the last 10 years. I have stayed here in the past. It is better than previously, not so dark and musty.;3
OK.  LEts get this straight.  A hotel is a building with rooms that face outside.  A Motel is a building where the hallways are on the outside and the rooms face the hallways - meaning that you have no windows unless you want everyone walking by your room to look in at you.  And the people walking by your room might as well be in your room..there is no acoustical separation between hallway and rooms.  This Four Points LAX is a motel.  It is actually a badly renovated (retrofitted is a better word).  Its just a low class dump.    I am especially angry about staying here because it is advertised as  a savvy boutique hotel...which it sooo is not!;1
I stayed 3 days at the Four Points LAX and it couldn't have been any better.  Everybody was friendly and helpful from the management on down:  parking attendant, front desk, restaurant, bar, housekeeping.  Always greeting people with a smile.  The room was clean and quiet and the bed was very comfortable.  There is free Wi-Fi everywhere in the hotel, even the bar.  The restaurant has very good food (try the salmon) and Brewster's Bar has 15 flat screen TVs and a large selection of beers from around the world.  A very enjoyable stay.  I repeat:  it couldn't have been any better.;5
I like to first say the bed was very comfortable and the fitness center was very nice. You dont find many fitness centers that free weights. The rest was sub par. When booking the hotel I was not aware of the daily parking fee, which was a bummer since it was $19 a night. As a business traveler wifi is really important to me. First I could get connected then after a while it would kick me out. The worest part is that I wouldn't be able to get back on for the rest of the night. Restarting the computer would help but it still wouldnt allow me to stay connected. When I talked to tech support they were able to restart the router but that only allowed me to stay connected for 15 minutes at a time and then I would lose connection again. The room was ok, I could have lived without;2
I booked the hotel as a Park, Sleep and Fly with a stay at both ends of my trip out of LAX.  After being up for almost 24 hours with travel on my return trip, I arrived at the Four Points Hotel at a quarter past midnight wanting only to climb into a comfortable bed.  Upon check-in, I was told that rooms were not yet ready and I would have to wait 30 to 40 minutes before housekeeping would have a room clean.  While sitting in the lobby, I overheard the manager talking about needing rooms early in the morning.  He actually asked me if I would be out of the room by 6am.  I believe in profit and efficiency, but not at the expense of customer service.;1
"To read some reviews leaves me wondering what people are expecting. Its NOT a Sheraton, so you wont get a club lounge, it's NOT a Westin, so you won't get a ""heavenly"" bed, it's NOT a St. Regis, so you won't get a butler....what you will get is an amazing team of front-desk staff that whose actions and attitude say ""welcome"" as readily as their words do. They're always have a smile and a positive attitude, always friendly, always ready to help.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and your first impression of the 4-Points LAX is a top-notch front office team whose glad you're here and it shows.  .  Another first impression might be the convenience of their location to your rental car:  If you're driving, your rental car pick-up drop off is literally just";5
upscale hotel, decent price, they charge you to park, but so does every other hotel in area.;5
Friendly and helpful staff. Our interest is in aviation, so asked for high room looking toward the airport. No problem. Allocated exactly what we wanted overlooking front of hotel. Other possibilities would have been in centre section of hotel with either a North or South facing view with views of aircraft on the N or S approaches. Very clean,  comfortable and quiet. Spent 5 nights there and it was certainly one of the better hotels experienced during our 3+ week holiday.;5
We arrived in the afternoon and were excited by the outward appearance of the hotel.  Staff seemed very friendly and greeted us promptly.  All was going well until we went to use the restroom.  My girlfriend just had breast surgery and has drain pumps coming out her underarms (she can not shower).  First problem with this was the bathtub was filthy.  Not was it only dirty, but the porcelain was damaged so bad it was ridiculous.  Was this part of the new renovation?  Moving forward we pulled out the floor towel and noticed black pubic hair on the floor.  Not just these short hairs, but long ones as well.  We are both blonde.   I almost forgot to mention the used band aid on the floor as well.  There were no bathing towels in the room, nor was there any conditioner.  Lastly, there;3
Staff was kind, amenities plenty-full,rooms comfortable, when in LA a great place to stay.;5
Our stay was just an overnight to catch a plane the next morning.  It had been a hectic week so the quick and easy check-in process was very welcome.  Our room was comfortable and quiet.  Fully rested for the long trip home.;5
Friendliest people in hospitality industry. I stay at this hotel for a week every month. I have become friends with all levels of employees of this hotel. They go out of their way to make me feel welcome and attend to my needs while away from home.;5
The hotel is good if you arrive at the room at 10pm, sleep, wake up at 6am, and then checkout.  I stayed 2 nights, the first night I got the one of the rooms in the back tower on the third floor, which are not renovated.  The bed was not comfortable.  I then requested to move to the renovated room, and got the fourth floor on the front tower.  The room is definitely much nicer, and the bed is comfortable.  The room was spacious but the bathroom is on the smallish side.  It was a great stay if you happen to stay at the renovated room.;4
I am a road warrior and spend about 20 nights a month on the road. I see all sorts of hotels and this is my favorite. The prices are really modest and it is a 1st class hotel. Good rooms, very modern, all of the facilities you would expect, great location near LAX and staff that bend over backwards to be nice and helpful.;5
Good: Room smelled of smoke altho a nonsmoking roo. Nighy manager gave us a food voucher for the inconvenience.  Bad: Waited in line at front desk-only 1 person behind desk. Waited 10 minutes, then second person came on desk and asked for next person in line. I started to move forward and then she deliberately took a person in another line although I had been waiting much longer. the person may have been in a priority checkin line but she knew I had been there waiting BEFORE the other person had even gotten in line.  Bad: You had to pay for computer use to print a boarding pass. Computers were for computer use instead of dedicated to boarding passes so you had to wait for people playing etc. to be done. At an airport hotel, there should be dedicated kiosks just for boarding;2
We found the Four Points to be a great value and great experience. Remodeled rooms are well done and beds are very comfortable. Reasonable rate, close to airport, free shuttle and a free breakfast! We found all the employees we came in contact with to be very friendly and service oriented.;5
Whether for business or leisure, I found this hotel the most customer-oriented type when in LAX. People are simply fantastic, and they treat you the way should be, personalized and with a warm and charming smile!  Thank you again for my very pleasant stay.;5
Initially check-in was a bit slow due to a walk-in in front of me but once we were over that glitch everything was fantastic. The staff were very friendly, the room was very clean and the bathroom amenities sufficient but would have liked a shower gel and not just a bar of soap. The room was of excellent quality the only missing item the flatscreen TV I have come to expect from hotels in Australia but find really lacking in American hotels. However the stay was fantastic and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone requiring a hotel at the airport. My rating 9.2/10!;5
Stay away from room #218. It is next to a control room and its so cold and  loud its disturbing. Stay away from room #486 it STINKS. The smell was AWFUL! Finally, room #326 was nice and comfortable. Stayed in all 3 rooms in 2 nights. Had to keep requesting to be moved! NOTE: If you call to book a room make sure you are charged the exact amount the front desk clerk tells you over the phone. When I called I was given an exact amount and when I checked in, I was charged more. Overall experience: Just terrible!!! Embarassing for the hotel!;1
Very close to the airport and the main car rental sites (Budget is just opposite), this worked out just fine for us. Helpful check-in staff changed our room without any problem as it was opposite the elevator. The restaurant was ok and reasonable value. The airport shuttle was reliable in our experience, and we had a good night's sleep,;4
The hotel charges over a 100.00 a nite and then has the nerve to charge you for parking in the lot each and every nite, for like 19.00 a nite. I only parked there once and learned my lesson, I got my bill, at the end of my stay, and they charged me for parking in the lot for 4 nites. I had to walk to the hotel 2-3 blocks every day or every nite that I parked the car. The elevators were very slow, only 2 of the 3 elevators worked. My son liked the pool, and there was never any towels in there to use after you got out of the pool. I told someone to bring towels, and they took at least 15 minutes to bring towels to the pool. The hotel is very overrated and for the price, everything should be tip-top shape, but not even close. My recommendations, do not stay here, find somewhere you;1
From the moment we checked in the forien exchange student with no personality, to the filthy room that we had to move out of, to the beuitfull resteraunt with no service and at best average food. It was disapointing because when we stayed here in october it perfect. My daughter is going to school in La in fall and your hotell made perfect since i guess we have to look else where.  GARY TURENNE ROOM 338;2
I selected this hotel because of its close location to LAX and its free shuttle. When I arrived I was told the shuttle ran every 15-20 minutes. We tried to catch the shuttle at 6:15 am. I knew we were in trouble when I saw the shuttle pull away from the door and leave 4 people standing in line. We waited 25 minutes for the next shuttle but it was full  when it arrived! We were told only 5 people would be allowed on the bus, but by then there were at least 18 people waiting. We discovered that the shuttle is shared with the Hilton and it picks them up first! People pushed to get on the bus and it was chaos. I will NOT stay here again.;2
"Oh thats great, wait until after I check in THEN you tell me after I already paid for my room , Its going to cost me $19 to have my car out in the middle of an open lot ? don't bother tell me when I make my reservation. Gee you would think for the price they charge for a room a little bigger than a closet that you could at least park your car while you are staying. Oh and if your a ""Heavier"" person watch out because the door to the bathroom is barely 2ft wide and the elevators hold maybe 3-4 people if they squeeze in. This place doesn't even have any parking to check in. I will say that the bed was comfortable and the room was reasonably quiet, It also enjoys a close proximity to LAX.  I almost forgot the ""FREE wireless internet"" with a connection that is slower than dial-up and";2
"The last time I stayed here I made the reservation at a different hotel (Four Points Culver City) and even though I showed up at the wrong hotel and they were sold out, James at the front desk called the rewards desk, got my points transferred, and found me a room. Today I am getting ready to stay there again, I booked two rooms and when I called to request adjoining rooms they said, ""Oh, we noticed that and we already assigned you adjoining rooms."" Now that's service!";5
We took a double bed room on their newly renovated section.  The quality was ok, but I was a bit disappointed by the bathroom... a bit small. I was expecting a bit better from a Sheraton.  Overall : clean, calm, and fair price considering how close it is from the airport;3
I just spent one night here and got a great deal so value-wise, I was impressed.   I arrive about 11pm and it was pouring rain. I drove around to the parking lot (uncovered) hoping there would be a back door I could go in through, but the back lot is a bit shady (or at least in the rain) and I drove back out to the front and decided to valet which wasn't much more expensive.  I was checked in immediately and went up to my room. I'm Starwood Platinum which usually means I'm upgraded but I'm not sure there are upgraded rooms here. There was a nice note from the GM stating that they are re-doing the Preferred Level, and there was also a plate of cookies and grapes, which I felt was a nice touch for this level of hotel. There were also several bottles of water.   The bed was;4
comfortable room, helpful staff, perfect location close to airport;4
I cant believe the sheraton would steep that low our rooms were a tack on i think or old offices one or the other painted up 1970 wallpaper and all rooms were entered by having to go through a door that had exit written on it?????? Even the staff wernt sure how to get to it;1
The front desk was friendly, welcoming and helpful. The dining room staff was also friendly, welcoming and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable.;5
The staff made my day and stay personal and indivual. I felt like I was the most important person and very special. Thank you very much.;5
As soon as I arrived, I wasn't sure where to go, and I was quickly greeted by a staff member that directed me to the service desk.  Very friendly.  I was prepared to pay $35/day parking at LAX.  I was advised by one of the staff that the hotel offers long term parking.  This was a huge savings for me and totally unexpected.    The rooms were clean and comfortable.  There was a shuttle service that ran all day and night to and from LAX.  It was very convenient.  I will definitely stay here again and will recommend this to friends and family.;5
The experience at a hotel starts with check-in and here is the magic of Four Points LAX—Juan is a friendly face and gentle soul who greeted us on our first visit a year ago, and yet again this time. He firstly recognized us right away and made us feel right at home.   His personal attention to ensure our comfort and concerns were addressed at every level possible made all the difference.   The hotel has recently undergone renovation and the rooms have been remodeled to fit modern taste and our growing business travel requirements.  The rates were quite a steal for the joy we got from being here... Highly recommend you make a home away from home at the Four Points LAX when in LA... I have...;5
The Four Points is an inexpensive option close to the airport.  I had a business meeting downtown but needed to fly back to NY the next morning so decided to stay closer to the airport.  My colleague booked the Four Points so decided to join him (rather than the Westin where I've stayed before).   There are plenty of options by the airport, they are all lined up next to each other.  You need to pay for parking which is fine.  The parking lot is on the back side of the hotel.  Didn't have much so we just walked to reception thru the hotel.  Check-in was fine, they had our reservations.   Although I am a Gold SPG member, I did not get an upgrade so I got an older room.  Still fine since I was only staying in the room for a few hours to sleep and my colleague got us low room rate.;3
Just stayed at this hotel on the last leg of our trip in LA and Vegas I booked through Priceline and I got what I paid for...an old dated room in the Unrenovated part of the Hotel...when I asked to be moved..they did accomadate us to another room again in the older part of the Hotel..I asked was this the best  they could do...yes they said these are the rooms saved for Priceline. We could hear our neighbors...there was a large stain on the carpet..gave me the creeps...Thank God it was only for one night... We dropped off our rental car before we came so thankfully didn't have to pay for Parking..;3
I loved it when arrivaed there people assisted with my luggage and then wnet to reception and care cared for straight away .. The room was nice and the beds were comffy. The greeting and theservice was outstanding as people were eager to assist you without being overwhlemed.;5
We booked 2 rooms the night from the 17th to 18th of February.  We ended up in rooms that should have been closed to public a long time ago. They were not even 1% close to the picture on their webpage. Entering the room I sensed a very offensive smell coming out of the bathroom. The sink had a big crack, the tub was really old and dirty. I did not dare to stay in that tub bare foot. The faucets were leaking. The room itself had a lot of burnmarks in the carpet, the blanket had holes, the lamp shades were broken, the furniture had water spots and were completely worn out. Charging more than 140 USD per night is almost robbery. We are talking about rooms 465 and 463. We were both speechless about the rooms. The attached pictures are from room 463. We will definately never stay;1
We arrived after a 13 hour flight from Australia and meet at the front Desk by James. After checking in we discovered we had no power adaptor and went to the front desk where we we advise theydid not have any. we went around the gift shop no luck and all the other stores in the area. went to the front desk agian to see James advised our problem,  he said wait a few moments and he would see what he could do  Guess what he came back with one  he sorted out all our problems and gave us a lot of usefull tips for our trip  we have been to 10 times over the past 8 years and this is the best service from anyone  Well dome James  Peter Kolla was also a good ambassator for this hotel and very plesant to talk to in the morning;4
I was traveling with my husband and two small children. We had gotten in an accident and was shaken up by it all day. When we finally got to our hotel, we were treated with wonderful costumer service the moment we walked in the door. The front service desk was kind, quick and easy, we also had help right away with our bags and everything we had in our car since it was towed. Our mood changed from being sad and worried to being relaxed and happy as if we were on a vacation. The best part was speaking to the hotel manager named Justin because he took the time to give us a call and to let us know that we will be taken care of and he stood by his words. Our day turn from traumatic to an anmazing fun family night!  Thanks to Four Point by Sheraton and Justin! We will be staying there;5
"I just recently stayed at this hotel with my husband for a ""getaway from the kids"" day. I actually found the hotel using this Tripadvisor site. We got a really good deal for a last minute getaway. I took my husband to the Laker game at the Staples Center that evening and the drive was not bad at all as far as the distance goes; about 10 minutes, no traffic. The check in process was really fast and the service was excellent; also on the check out. The room was really clean, the bed was soft and no stains anywhere, I checked. The bathroom was very clean. My husband and I had such a nice time there that we will be staying again for future getaways.";4
"I have had the privilege ---across the last 6 months ---and hopefully the next 6 months+ of being assigned special project in LA.---working in the golden state on a very fun future electric car project.  Good thing for me here--- is that I get to have this chapter of my life for a year or longer ---experiencing LA and various parts of CA (visits to SF, Napa, Tahoe, Universal studios, Hearst Castle, Big Sur, Shangri-La roof top Santa Monica, beaches of Manhattan, China Town (although does not compare to C-T Chicago), Panatges Theatre Hollywood for Phantom (WOW!) --even a day at Hollywood Park--- always wanted to spend some time in California.          I have been basing myself out of this fanatstic hotel ""4points sheraton"" 5star in my book!!--- with fantastic caring helpful";5
Having had our flight cancelled due to blizzard in New York we had to find accomodation quickly in LA. for 2 nights. Having stayed in Four Point Sheratons around the world before and known them to be of high standad we went here.  Well what a shock!!!!!!  The rooms were so tiny you tripped over your bags as there were no bag racks to put them up off the floor. The room had a stink that made you want to heave when you walk in, there were holes in the walls, carpets in hallway and rooms were stained. The blinds were covered in dirt and pen marks,  The internet was so slow that you used up the 15 minutes free time just trying to log on. The pillows were like rocks,and you could hear everything that was going on in the room next door. Table leg broken on the desk so we had to prop;1
"Had two stays here within two weeks. First time I was on one of the higher floors (fifth if I'm not mistaken), and the room was so-so; not very well insulated, so noise from the outside and from adjacent rooms was a bit of an issue.  However, the second stay was on the 2nd floor, in another wing of the hotel (where the rooms have windows to the main hallway instead of to the outside) and this was a great room.  For the rest, you have all the usual Four Points pros such as free internet and free bottled water. And of course the hotel is very close to LAX airport, and has a free shuttle to/from LAX that runs at 15 minute intervals 24 hours a day (even at 5 in the a.m. I did not have to wait long for a shuttle to turn up).";3
Got a great deal for last minute stay close to LAX. Outside appearance is not the same as inside, it is very modern, clean and comfortable inside. Only drawback was parking came at a premium and there is not an alternative, BUT the cost of my room and parking was still less than most rooms alone. Staff generally a happy bunch, which was nice. Got a quick bite in the cafe and the staff very accomodating and happy too. I would stay here again.;5
Excellent hotel that never fails to recognize its Platinum members. Did not know that courtesy late check out at this establishment for Platinums is 6PM rather than 4PM! Recently renovated rooms, excellent internet connection. Caring Staff!! What more can one ask for?;5
"A hotel reflects its management and the site lives up to the hype. Newly renovated rooms are a pleasure to rest in after a 14 hour plane ride. Pro: Nice quick shuttle. Easy checkin. Very nice clean rooms. Great bar atmosphere. Front desk reponded to an emergency quickly.  The bath room faucet broke and the repair man was there in five minutes to prevent a flood. Great big signs to direct a new guest to the right direction. Con.I like to have room key access to exercise rooms and elevators to keep out the riff raft. But the beauty of no keys or security is waved. The hotel is right next door to other ones.  Burger King is across the street if you so desire.  Standard room charges are competivie with other places. Non smoking is du jour. The hotel is a ""H"" shape one and I would";5
Even though near the airport, it has a local hotel feel.  They are just finishing a renovation that really has improved the look and feel of the hotel. The staff friendliness is what really makes the hotel a gem. After several visits everyone know your name. I really enjoy coming to this hotel.;5
Great price, friendly staff, very clean rooms! Will stay there again when in town!;5
I've already stayed at this hotel three times over the past year, and actually just booked it again as my hotel for my next trip to Los Angeles.  I don't travel for business, so I need to find a hotel within my budget and this is a great hotel at a great price.  The front desk staff is very friendly, will answer all of your questions, and overall I've experienced great service at this hotel.  The lobby appears brand-new with a coffee-shop, restaurant, and sports bar.  The exercise facilities are excellent, with televisions on the treadmills.  The rooms are very clean and look like standard hotel rooms.  I've been happy with every stay at this hotel, and that is why I keep coming back to it.  Two notes, the first being parking is $14/night but I've stayed at other hotels around;5
"if you get to LA CA for any reason the ""Four Points"" hotel , where Gina is one of the best assistant managers in the world works is the best, most comfortable and guest friendly hotels that you may stay....";5
We stayed at Four Points after returning from a 15 day cruise through the Panama Canal.  We arrived late at LAX and just wanted some rest before heading home the next day.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the ease of check in, the courtesy of the staff, the cleanliness of the rooms, and  the fine dining at the restaurant that evening.  We awoke refreshed and re-energized the next morning.  I had checked on price and location before picking the Four Points and to me it is the best value around if you are looking for a place to stay before or after a flight.  We had left our vehicle there while on our cruise and turned out to be a safe and convenient choice.  I will stay again anytime I am using LAX and recommend the same to anyone who is traveling.;4
nothing like a starwood property, yet this one is above so many in regard to service...... from the front desk staff to housekeeping... always, and i do mean always, a delight to stay here.;5
I truly enjoyed my stay. The staff was wonderful and friendly.  We went for New Years Eve and the hotel was full because of the Rose Bowl but we experienced no delays or issues.. My room was nice and clean and we got a wonderful rate for a last minute getaway. Then to top it off the management sent me a plate of the best Chocolate Chip Oatmeal cookies I've ever had. I am a cookie monster so the small gesture went very far... I would recommend this hotel to everyone.;5
This is a well-traveled hotel with its ideal location near LAX airport. Very busy hotel. The rooms are somewhat worn, looks like an older converted motel actually. But the design is tasteful and the beds are comfortable. Small rooms, very small bathroom. But who cares if you're just looking for a decent place to stay for a night waiting on a flight. Not always so quiet as the doors open and shut loudly down the hallways and since near the airport, people coming and leaving at all hours of the night. Staff was extremely helpful. Parking costs $16 a night and the lot is around the back of the hotel, not the most convenient walk from lot to hotel. All in all, I'd probably stay here again if staying overnight to catch an early morning flight out of LAX. No major complaints.;3
Very impressed with the atmosphere at the hotel.  We were stranded in LA due to a snowstorm in Boston for 2 nights after travelling for 3 weeks abroad, and were so impressed by the friendliness of the staff, especially the waitstaff in the restaurant! They could not have been more accommodating and friendly.  Thanks for making a difficult situation feel less burdensome!;5
I travel to L.A quite frequently and I have stayed at many hotels in the area. The Four Points Hotel hit every point of service. The staff was very friendly and pleasant. Everyone was so nice and helpful, from the front desk to the porter cleaning the halls that smiled and pushed the elevator button for me to go down. The Bar and Grill in the lobby was amazing. They had a huge selection of beers around 100 I think. The staff at the Bar and Grill was just as awesome and friendly as the rest of the hotel staff. The food that accompanied my beer was really really good. There wasn’t really a need to leave the hotel for dinner. I thought the overall look of the hotel like the pool and the lobby ,had a luxury resort getaway feel to it. The surrounding area is nice and that is;5
From the moment of check in and through out the stay, the Four Points LAX offers a unique standard that is clearly head and shoulders above its peers. Gina the front desk manger dutifully runs the ship to insure smooth sailing. In fact the entire staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. At Four Points LAX, little things mean a lot. This is why I continually choose the Four Points LAX when ever I come to Los Angeles;5
This hotel is a very pleasant surprise.  It's more friendly and personal than the large chains. The staff is very attentive at all levels. When they say that it's their pleasure to help you, they actually mean it. Refreshing in today's world.;5
I enjoyed my stay at the hotel--my first at a Four Points Sheraton.  I was impressed by the friendly front desk staff and the efficiency with which the gentleman who checked me in worked.  Most impressive was the fact that he remembered my name immediately when I returned an hour later with a question.  I was somewhat disappointed with the room because the carpet was a bit soiled in a couple spots, although I'm finding this is pretty common (unfortunately).  All else was fine in the room, though.  Apparently I had a room in the tower that has not yet been fully renovated.  Really didn't notice any noise.  The halls need a little attention (paint, wallpaper, and carpet updates), although this is not to suggest that they were dirty--just worn.  Ate in the hotel because there;4
The lobby and bar are nice and spacious but the in-room bathrooms are in desperate need of an update. We stayed at a different LAX hotel with the same star rating a couple of weeks prior that was far superior for the same price.;3
I stayed here for 3 nights and had no complaints. Customer service was great...great shower pressure, free wi-fi and quite cozy. I've stayed at better 4 star hotels on century blvd. near the airport and i must say the customer service was sooo bad. Would stay again.;4
I don't know what is wrong with these hotels at LAX, but the info that they put on their sites is really misleading.  If I expect noise in a hotel, I don't really expect it to be coming from a very strong industrial noise in the AC of the renovated rooms.  I booked a deluxe with a 32 inch TV, all renovated.  Well, except for the AC, which was just a whirring horrible noise.  I got moved once and ended up with the exact same problem, where I worked out it had to be just the AC noise.   I ended up being downgraded to a standard room with an old style TV in order to get a regular sounding AC, noisy, but not whirring - a non-renovated room, crappy carpet etc, no full desk, but... well... at this stage of the game, after moving my luggage three times, it'll do.  The security staff;2
Excellent hotel all around! Great service, comfortable rooms, free shuttle to airport, and great parking offers while your are gone, especially in comparison to surrounding hotel park and fly offer.;5
this was a nice place to stay we stayed the night on our way to Hawaii. it had all we needed the food was great ,nice clean place. we will stay here again .;5
I booked this hotel and made a mistake with my reservation that I didn't notice until I showed up at the front desk. As it turned out, the manager at the hotel ended up working with me to rectify the situation - something that took a number of phone calls to third parties to sort out. I appreciated the fact that he could have just said no, but went the extra mile to assist. This is the kind of service that makes people return, which I would most certainly do next time I come to LA.  The hotel itself is nice, and the location can't be beat. Free shuttle from the airport. I didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on food/room service. The rooms themselves were well decorated, obviously due to some new renovations. I stay at hotels all the time, typically higher star level;4
I was encouraged by the majority of the reviews and decided to book a room despite the hotel's close promixity to LAX. Unfortunately, this hotel is a disappointment. They charge $16/day for self-parking (no free option available). The parking garage is old and requires that you walk outside to reach the hotel lobby. Our room was cramped and the bathroom was dirty. They have signs posted saying the property is being updated. But  in its current conditon - it is certainly sub-par for a Four Points property.;2
We stayed here on our first night in the States.  There was a free and frequent shuttle to and from the airport which was great.  The staff at the front desk were very friendly.  The only slight disappointment was there was no king sized bed as requested, however, they were able to check us in very early. The room was fine, clean enough etc, but not anything special.  I was a little disappointed it wasn't a bit nicer, but there was nothing specific to complain about and the bed was comfortable.   The bar and restaurant downstairs had friendly staff and suited our needs for a one night/morning.   The only real problem I had with the hotel was the noise.  We had a large group (at least it sounded like it) check into rooms several rooms down from ours and all we heard for over an;3
"Pretty good hotel. Walking distance to LAX with free shuttle.   Pros: - clean rooms - friendly service - free shuttle to LAX every 20 to 30 min (they say 15 though ;) ) - good size room - pretty quiet considering one of worlds busiest airports is next door - free water (one small bottle but still...)  Cons: - I was there for 4 nights. In 3 of them the keys didn't work so I had to replace - parking is $16 per day for guests (somewhat expensive IMHO) - for the price you pay, parking could be better. The covered space is limited and you would still to walk in the rain to/from hotel (about 70 ft/15m) if you want to park in the covered place  Overall I would definitely stay here again considering the price and pros are worth";4
After missing the last flight out and having returned my rental car at LAX, I called the Four Points before heading over.   The hotel staff is friendly and sympathetic.  This clean hotel offered a reasonable rate. My room had a large flat screen TV, cozy bed and a deep tub.  Arriving late, I chose to wait until breakfast to eat. The food was delicious and the staff attentive.  Plus free shuttle to the terminal. Thumbs up!;5
I writing to express my gratitude to the LAX Four Points Sheraton Hotel front desk staff for accommodating me.  I booked through Starwoods with a live agent for the night of Dec 2nd when my flight came in from Bangkok.  When I arrived in LAX, I was surprised to see that my reservation was made for Dec 6th.  The gentleman at the front desk initially told me that I could stay there for a higher rate and I knew my reservation for the 6th was non-refundable. Overcome with complete exhaustion from a 15 hour flight and a 12 hour time change, I was very upset.  Within minutes, the gentleman left the desk and returned to tell me that they would honor the reservation without an additional fee.  I was so grateful and relieved that I could just go to a room and sleep.  My room was not in;5
Truly the best location for airport ease! Food was excellent, staff very friendly. The only disappointment was the shuttle was not available when I needed it. I ended up paying a cab to take me to the terminal for my departure. Very happy there was no airport noise in the rooms.  I am an SPG Gold Preferred member. Upon check in I was told the club level lounge is closed on weekends. The front desk gave me a courtesy breakfast voucher and a complimentary appetizer voucher for that night. A very nice touch!;4
"I stayed two night with my family at this hotel prior to my wedding in Los Angeles.  Although the hotel is going through renovations and didn't get a ""new"" renovated room, I was happy with the basic essentials. It appeared that the belldesk staff was under staffed because I only saw two bellmen running around. Eventhough the lack of staff, the bellman we had was wonderful with his customer service and never made us feel he had to leave to attend other guests. He made sure we were taken care of and especially acknowledged that I was  bringing precious cargo (my wedding dress), so he catered to my needs. Food was good, but for my taste, not too much to select from. Also, I wouldn't recommend for guests who plan to stay in their rooms after 9am meanwhile renovation is being done.";4
We were visitor from Japan then my family left the cell phone in the room but just aware after departed from LAX to Japan.  Even though it must be unusual request for them but kindly treated to arrange international percel delivery.  Due to time differences btwn Japan and US, we made email communication but was able to get prompt response everyday.  As everyone know, it's very inconvinience for daily life without cell phone ( missing friends number or email address ! ) , but within just a week we get it back in hands 5,500 miles far from LA.  We thank you very much for their excellent quality hospitality.;5
i decided to come  back  already four times   in thirty  days  as i really  enjoyed the  kidness of  all assocaites . the  value  of the  hotel  is  perfect even if  you get   an old room . There  is no problem  in this  hotel   as the associates  resolve  anything  in  few  minutes  THANKS  TO  ALL TEAM   i really  appreciated   your  professionalism mrs  Froumentin;5
I happened to end up staying here when Priceline failed to secure my other hotel reservation. All I have to say is besides the dirty carpets, elevators, windows, and sketchy hotel guests - it was just OK. The room itself was decent and clean, but I wouldn't stay here again. I guess that is what you get for 65 bucks a night!;3
That was really great experience by staying in Four Points. quiet clean ans sweet personal around ready to help in any minute. I had a nice rest before my flight back to NY. Thank you all and spatial to Yasin Kutly and Musie!!!!!!;4
Could'nt have asked for better treatment from staff and accomadations were very comfortable. I recommend this hotel for anyone looking to feel at home. I have already recomended to friends.;5
I travel about every three to four weeks.  I stay in quite a few hotels.  This hotel is outstanding for it's service, it's proximity to LAX, and it's value.  Although I don't prefer to stay in hotels, when I am in the LAX area, this hotel is my first and only choice.  The staff is friendly and helpful, they have a shuttle to LAX, and they have an incredible selection of specialty beers in their restaurant and lounge.  You owe it to yourself to stay here next time you are in Los Angeles!;5
I've stayed at this hotel many times since August.  The staff is wonderful, especially the front desk team.  It appears that they are led by a woman named Elsa who is a top-notch customer service person.  This team greets me with a smile and addresses me by my name each time I arrive.  These simple things mean a lot.  The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are in the process of being renovated now.  I have stayed in both renovated and unrenovated rooms.  Even the unrenovated ones are fine - clean and well appointed.  The renovated ones are fantastic.  The gym is stocked with plenty of weight machines, treadmills & other arobic machines.  Nice quality hotel and I can't say enough about the staff.;5
I stayed at this hotel because of its close proximity to the airport and the great rate. I arrived at 3 am after a Halloween party and was pleasantly surprised to immediately have valet show up and help me remove my bags and take my car. The front desk was staffed as well and I was in my room in no time. There were even cookies and some grapes in our room that was refreshing for a quick snack before bed.;5
This hotel was very handy for cathing our airplane at LAX for our trip to Korea for the 60th reunion fo the KOREAN WAR. Unfortunately the commode was stopped up on the morning we were to leave, I would assume that someone cleared the stoppage after we left.;5
I'm glad to say that the excellence in service is achievable, and the Staff at Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport is the best!;5
Have had troubles finding a good airport around LAZ this is it.  Huge corner room with work center and very clean.  Only issue was slow airport shuttle but otherwise highly recommend very good rates for around the airport too!;5
The room was small and the internet connection was very very slow.  If you are a business traveller DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  There is free wireless internet, but the connection was so slow that it wasnt worth it.  The room was very small with no room to spread out.;1
Stayed for one night en route from Australia to Detroit.  Pick up service was efficient and prompt, driver was very helpful with loading/unloding luggage.  Early check in was no problem for a small charge, great value for money.  Staff very friendly and very helpful.;4
I stayed at the hotel for a professional conference.  I liked the convenience to the airport and the customer service was outstanding.  The rooms, however, were another story.  My room was clean, but worn.  The bathroom was very basic and in bad need of remodeling.  Tile surrounding the tub was poorly patched with caulking.  The contractor who put down the floor tile was cheap - instead of using a bullnose tile or nice edge tile for the base trim, they simply cut the floor tile in half and plastered it to the wall (you can see the glaze drips on the top edge.)    The bed was comfortable, but the under blanket was threadbare in spots.  Housekeeping took to placing the large back pillows on top of the TV cabinet rather than replacing them on the bed.  I was disabled and on;3
I read some of the reports on trip advisor and the only thing I can guess is that I got one of the rooms that had not been updated.  The carpet is dated and stained, the room had an old musky smell and the bathrooms were dated with old tile and showers.  The beds were comfy but that was the only small concession, as the front desk was understaffed and it was hard to get questions answered.  I had planned to stay here a week from now and already changed my reservation.  Too many other places to stay that are close to the airport to settle for this one.;2
The staff at the four points went far beyond the regular duties in finding a room for me in a fully booked hotel. My room was initially booked for a wrong date and Orbitz ( good for nothing) could not help me at all! If not for the wonderful staff - thank you Jazmin - I would have been stuck at LAX with no car and no place to stay. I'm glad to eve this opportunity to recommend this hotel to all travelers. TWO THUMBS UP!;4
After a long flight from the East Coast, all I want is to sleep.  I got in around midnight and this hotel was packed!  I waited in line for check in and was told they couldn't find my reservation, even though I brought the printed out confirmation with me.  They asked me to sit and wait while they found it and then they would call me over.  I sat around for 30 min with no one noticing me, then decided to get in line again and see what's happening.  I was then told by a different person that they have no idea why the previous employee didn't see my reservation...but now there are no rooms ready.  Can I please wait an hour?  At this point I'm really tired and cranky and I tell him no, I cannot wait until 1:30am.  check in is at 3pm, how do you not have a room ready at 1am?!!?!  He;2
Yes the hotel is in the middle of a refurb but the newly refurbished rooms are excellent. New bathroom tiling, flat screen TV, great bedding and quality furnishings - all for $75 a night. Come on guys it is a deal !! Quick pick up from LAX and quick check-in - I'm happy;4
Great Service. On time Shuttle Service. Clean new Lobby Area.;4
"I read other people's reviews and chose this as a late night one night only stop over after a long flight from the UK. All we wanted was a nice quiet room with a good bathroom at a reasonable rate and close to LAX and car hire.  My heart sank as we came out of the lift to the ""newly refurbished"" rooms to be greeted by an old carpet covered with builders grit/rubble. Old rooms with windows facing a corridor (aargh). We opened the doors to our rooms to be met with a damp smell. We weren't allocated the correct rooms despite my booking on the phone..we were meant to have a double next to a twin queen and when I queried this I was told this room configuration didn't exist. The bath was tiny. Plus points check in was swift, breakfast was pretty good for what it was and roomd were";2
We chose this hotel because it offered a reasonable day rate for a room. We checked in around 9am, and left around six pm. We booked the room via email with a very helpful reservations agent (info@fourpointslax.com). The room was comfortable enough and good for catching a few hours sleep. The bathroom was a little dated, but again, perfectly adequate for our needs. Apart from a short sleep, we didn't spend much time in the room as we were out and about getting some fresh air after a long flight and before the next one. I'd recommend for travellers looking for somewhere to crash between flights, although I prefer places like the Hilton Garden Inn which tend to be a bit brighter. We used the free Apple desktops in the lobby to check in for our flight and print out boarding passes;3
Outstanding service --  lovely room with comfortable beds -- easy access to transportation -- everyone who works here was very friendly and helpful.;5
I stay in the hotel from the 10/13 till 10/16, I paid $116 per nigth. In the hotel they said that parking in the hotel was $16 per night or I can park my car in the street but that I have to be carefull were to park. We went to the restaurant, my wife order a salad, the lettuce wasn't cut and was with out dressing. The Wi Fi in the room wasn't good, the computer found it but wasn't working, the coffe machine wasn't working. I will never go back again.;2
We did the park and fly on the 5th of October and returned on the 12th to pick up our car, well it was 11PM and dark so we didn't see the crack in the lower part of our 2007 Honda Civic SI windshield until we were a few miles away and the streetlights made a snail trail effect on the crack (passenger side), the crack goes from the edge toward the middle about a foot in, so now we need a new windshield and it will cost us $500 bucks It was NOT there when we left. We are pretty upset but how can we prove it wasn't there to begin with, we can't. I don't know if it was vandalized or a rock fell out of the sky with enough force to crack my windshield, nothing else was amiss, but it's not covered parking and we parked in the first row in front of the fence at the top of the ramp. The;3
I was in town for 5 nights for a conference at the Marriott next door, and got a great rate @ this hotel.  The rooms are small, especially for more than 2 people, but the amenities were great and the staff/concierge were very accommodating.  If you are having a roommate make sure that the person who makes the reservation puts that person's name down AND confirms it before arrival.;5
We are overseas visitors and always stay at this hotel when in LA.  It is convenient for flights plus free shuttle is a bonus . Bus Transit Station close by for travellers who prefer to absorb the local atmosphere and people.  James at the booking desk was most helpful with any special request.  Renovations are in progress with a minimum of fuss. Free Wifi in room was very slow and not too reliable. Bedding was extremely comfortable.  We look forward to our next stay in LA and this hotel.;4
My recent stay at the Four Points LAX was tremendously rewarding.  From the Front Desk to Housekeeping and restaurant staff everything was very professional.  The staff treated me as a very welcome guest and anticipated my needs.  The room was very comfortable, relaxing and clean.  The renovations to the restaurant provided a warm atmsphere for dinner.  TO top it off Room Service was exceptional as well as affordable and provided a variety of meals.  My favorite meal was a Pork Tenderloin which featured steamed rice and brocolli.  The gravy that was over the pork was very flavorful.  As a seasoned traveler it was very nice to be treated so well for such an affordable price.;5
I am writing to you with a major complaint.  I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, and booked a one-night stay at the Four Points Sheraton Hotel at the LAX International Airport for Saturday, October 9 2010.  The purpose of the stay was because my elderly parents were flying into LAX on an International Overnight flight, which was scheduled to land at 6:00am.  I live in San Diego, which is approximately a 2.5 hour drive from LAX.  I decided to get a hotel so I could pick them up very early, then bring them back to shower and rest for a few hours before heading back to San Diego.  Starwood hotels have always been of the highest quality, so I was excited to find a Four Points for only $75/night.  Upon arrival at the hotel, there was a bit of a  traffic jam entering/exiting the self;1
Visited Los Angeles County again, and stayed at the LAX Four Points for an evening.  Shuttle buses from LAX and location are decent (it is, after all, an airport hotel). Self-parking is relatively expensive, but no more expensive than other airport hotels in the area. There are, however, not very many spaces -- if you have a late night out, you'll be circling a few times to find a spot.  You can tell that they renovated the lobby area, which is clean and professional. The outdoor pool area is very nice, too. If you are SPG Platinum, don't hold your breath for any benefits from this hotel, though.  It appears that I had a non-renovated room (see SPG Plat), with a CRT TV, and a functional bed/bathroom format. The facilities (e,g. bathroom) are noticeably dated, but it wasn't grimy;3
We spent the weekend in LA at the end of a vacation to Orange County. We chose it based on its chain and location to LAX. We were shocked to have some form of rock band event take place on both Saturday and Sunday nights.  It began in the early evening and lasted until past midnight each night. It was so loud that although occurring over a block away, the bass rattled the windows and shook the walls as if someone were on the other side pounding with their fists. I complained each night, but the staff said there was nothing that could be done. I took the opportunity to investigate the site the following day. Although it's located in a tent structure, the site has a semi-permanent appearance. We found it clean and acceptable in most respects, but the cleaning staff didn't service;2
Room is a very good size. Even though it was in close proximity to the airport, I slept soundly & the blackout curtains helped me get a good night's rest. It's also conveniently located next to all the rental cars so picking up/dropping off was a cinche. Free wifi, cafe/restaurant, and pool access a bonus. Parking is a bit expensive as with all airport locations. Only suggestion to the hotel is that the bathrooms may need some upgrading. Good for short stay or business travelors.;3
Give this place a try and you will be blown away by the great overall experience.;5
On airpot grounds - easy shuttle - close to rental cars, walking distance.  This is the way to go flying in from the East Coast the night before a meeting.  Decent bar as well.  It is in the middle of an airport - so I would never suggest for any other reason.  I found the room clean, serviceable, and good internet connection.;4
We stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago.  And it was absolutely disgusting.  The room, floor and bathroom were dirty.  The handle on the phone in the room was sticky with grime.  We were so tired from our business trip and we had an early flight out that morning that we decided to just stay there.  Be aware of this dirty hotel by LAX.;1
"The hotel itself is of poor design - many of the rooms have windows that look only out into a public hallway with windows on the other side. So basically no window in the room at all.  There are two types of rooms - renovated which are nice, and unrenovated, which are not shown on the website and not very nice (they should show the""Classis"" or unrenovated rooms as well on the web site or it is bait and switch).   The real problem is with management and preferred guests, in particular whoever manages check-in (Jairo Alvarez). As a Platinium guest I hope to be given a decent room. It's not like I book thru some discount web site and stay within the chain very little. For some reason I was given what can only be described as the worst room in the hotel. They even called and asked";2
"I stayed at the Four Points Sheraton LAX for 6 nights and the stay was phenomenal. I would go back there in a heartbeat.  I will admit I was bit skeptical when I booked online because you never know what you gotta get or better yet stay in...wasn't the case here.  When I walked into the hotel lobby I was ""wow'd"" when I noticed that the lobby area had been renovated.  It really looked like something off of HGTV. It is evident that Hotel Mgmt invested a lot of $$$ and time with the look of the lobby.   Very well done.   The front desk attendants were all very polite and professional. I also had a chance to meet the Director of Operations, Peter Kolla. Peter was very approachable and professional. He presented me with a business card and told me to contact him with any questions I";4
I had a GREAT stay at the Four Points LAX and really enjoyed the service in the restaurant/bar.  Celione the bartender/server took great care of us during the two days we were passing through LA.  The food was great and I liked the variety on the menu.  Great property!!!;5
Good location for avoiding the Los Angeles traffic the night before leaving. Shuttle pick up to and from LAX. Not much in the way of dining in the area. Hotel has a good sports bar with lots of games on the big screens. Would not spend much time in this area as it is not close to Hollywood or the beaches. Staff was friendly and helpful. Close to the Hertz and Budget rental car outlets.;3
The concierge was polite. Although some seem fake...  First, this hotel charges to much for guest parking .  Front desk people were nice.  Some of the staff in the hotel palm grill ignore  me when I needed service and seemed to be impersonal.  They need to fix there internet which runs to slow. Elevators are slow. Location is not to far from a bad side of town . The advantage close to airport which means you will not miss your flight. Ace rental car I will not use again due to bad attitude of the brunette working there whom charged my card extra and she does not want to assist me in fixing the problem they made by her mistake. She lacks customer service skills. She needs to retire her job or learn how to do her job.   The housekeepers go out of there way for you , they need a;1
I was overnighting at LAX and booked directly on the Sheraton website - for an excellent rate.  When I checked in, there was a little mix up on my room.  So, I called down to the front desk and the lady was very, very helpful in trying to straighten things out.  It wasn't a couple of minutes later and the Manager on Duty shows up on my floor, near my room to make sure that everything was OK and being resolved.  I had not asked anyone to come up - he did that of his own accord.  I have traveled for business all over the world for many years, and you rarely, rarely see that level of service.  On top of that, after I was situated into my room, I received a call from the front desk lady who helped me to make certain that everything was OK and that I was comfortable.  Considering how;5
old and not that clean-- noisy and thin walls. horrible place;1
Considering I travel between Los Angeles and Las Vegas a lot, I stay at many hotels and casinos along the way, and the Four Points really stood out.  It was the Monday after Labor Day, so I was understandably exhausted.  There was a mix up with my car rental (my fault, not theirs!), so I decided just to stay at the hotel where I was trying to get a car.  And what a pleasant surprise it was!  Mind you, I had zero expectations as I was just tired and wanted to relax and had actually never stayed in the LAX area because I believed it was just way too expensive, but too my surprise when i went to the desk, the rate I was quoted was lower than ANY place I have stayed in L.A.  I couldn't believe it!!!  That was the first surprise.  The second was the extremely comfortable;5
If you want a hotel that has clean rooms ,good food and staff that go the extra mile to make you feel special this is the one for you .I had my 50th birthday at this hotel and the staff and G.M did everything possible to make it a great day for me .I highly recommend this hotel for anybody looking for that special treatment that makes a trip memorable;5
I spent a week at this Hotel at the end of August for a conference held at the Hotel itself. I found the staff quite accommodating, the location at LAX perfect for our group of people from all over the world, the food greatly improved over past years.  The only small glitch was the speed of the internet and its reliability. It was down for a day or so and they worked hard to fix it and ultimately did fix it.  They have assured our group that the problem was temporary and by the day we left it was much improved.     From a meeting planning perspective there is great value at this property both in terms of meeting space, location, and pricing.  Our group continues to come back every year for these reasons.;4
This hotel really isn't bad, but there's nothing super about it.  As long as you know what you're getting--and you're getting it for a good price--it's some place I could recommend.   What I liked about it: -Creative marketing of Four Points -Free WiFi in room -Free bottle of water in room (daily) -Accessible and adequate exercise facility -A comfortable in-room workspace -A great location in terms of proximity to airport, rental cars, and highways -A reliable shuttle service to the airport What you need to realize you'll also be (unfortunately) getting at this price: -A hard bed on which you can kind of feel individual springs -An out-of-date bathroom (but everything works) -The slowest elevators of anyplace I've stayed -A nearly-useless concierge service / info desk -A surface;4
The full range of quality services, personal accommodation, attention to detail, friendly and professional treatment on every occasion was among the very best I've ever received and I've travelled extensively on four continents!;5
This hotel is very close to LAX.  It is being remodeled which is great.  The staff at this hotel is one of the friendliness I have every incounted at a chain hotel.  Beer bar is very sports friendly.  Great place to stay.;5
First of all there is no microwaves in the rooms to warm up food so you have to buy THEIR food which is VERY expensive. The sheets and covers are old. The room is very small. There is hardly any parking and it cost $16.00 a day to park. The t.v. only has like 5 channels. The food/ beverage credit sucks because everything is more than $5.00!!! The customer service is poor the front desk/ concierge. I would not recommend this hotel! Don't stay here!!!;2
Very conveniently located right across the street from Budget Rental Car.  I was able to return my rental car and walk across the street to this hotel for a good night's sleep before my morning flight out.  I followed suggestions in TripAdvisor and requested a renovated room in the central tower...  and the furnishings and layout were fine.  One thing that's a bit different is the windows look out onto a hallway which has exterior windows on the other side of the hall, rather than looking straight outside like normal windows.   I worried a bit that foot traffic past the room would wake me up during the night, but it didn't.  The folks at the front desk were extremely nice and very accommodating for check-in...  a welcome touch after a long drive on California's freeways.  While;3
I was not impressed by this hotel and wished that we would have booked our night elsewhere. romm was not clean, old equipment and parking not cheap either.;2
"So, the kids LOVED the place and thought it was ""way better than our house"" and since they seemed to be enjoying it so much, I didn't bother to point out to them that the faucet in the bathtub/shower combo was literally detached from the wall, with the caulking clinging to it.  And while we're on the subject of the bathroom, it was barely larger than a coat closet and so uncomfortably small that my legs were knocking against the door and the bathtub when I had to use the toilet.  (Too much info? MAYBE, but in case you want to know if you'll be comfortable, you most likely won't be in the bathroom.)  I also didn't make a big deal of the fact that the pool had no water in it.  Why bother? There is a whole entire ocean a couple blocks away.    Personally, I think some of my";3
Stayed at hotel prior to returning to the UK. Room small and fairly comfortable, however bathroom seemed tired and in need of an overhaul. Noisy at night and poor soundproofing to outside corridor. Bar had decent atmosphere and close to airport with good courtesy bus. Much preferred the Embassy Suites which we have stayed at previously (on the opposite corner).;3
The general manager Erik Dahlerbruch always had time to stop and see how our stay was going. I travel a very lot and Erik and his staff treated us like family, I will and have recomended this hotel. Thank you    Tom Rauber                                                                   Pres. U.S.F.I.;5
"My stay at the Four Points LAX was perhaps the worst in years.  The hotel posts pictures of renovated rooms on the website, but I have stayed here twice and both times had rooms that looked like they hadn't been touched in 20 years.  This is unforgivable in my opinion.  At least 2 dozen stains on the carpet and furniture, scratchy towels, furniture that hadn't been wiped down in decades.  The coffee packets didn't even fit in the coffee maker (and it wasn't the usual Seattle's Best).   Worst of all was the smell; the hallways and the room had a pungent, sour odor that was sickening.  I changed rooms but they all smelled.  The hotel is an embarrassment to the brand.  Some of the staff were friendly, most were apathetic and unhelpful.  Take my advice: spend a few extra bucks and";2
This hotel is purely utilitarian- no frills, no luxury. Good place to spend the night before you board the flight. The hotel is great value for money and you get what you pay for  :-);3
We needed a place to stay on our way back from Maui, and the Four Points by Sheraton had a great summer deal of $98 for a double,double. It was about $25-50 bucks cheaper than the surrounding hotels.  I was excited that we were going to be staying at a Sheraton. When we arrived, the lobby was very nice, and the service at check-in was very pleasant. The front desk mgr checked us in, and told us that we would be in one of the renovated rooms. When the elevator arrived at the 5th floor, we were confused at where to go. Yes, there were arrows pointing to the numbered rooms, but they all pointed to exit doors that looked like stairwells. When we ventured through ours, we walked down a long, musty, smelly hall (not to mention the pot smell coming from one of the rooms). It was like a;2
Absloutely good standard, just the used looking rooms (like in such hotels) are uninviting. I had to change the room,because many of the rooms are very noisy - close to generators(AC) or to the street side. No Breakfast included, nice bar and restaurant. There is a car rental company inside the hotel located - good to know for next time!;3
"I thought this would be a typical travellers'/conference hotel by the airport, but I was really surprised by the friendliness, courtesy, and willingness to be helpful qualities of the staff. Everybody had a smile on their face, greeted you, and looked you in the eye. I would especially like to thank Trish, at the desk; the manager, who greeted us the first morning in the lobby, with such a friendly upbeat manner; the maids who worked on our rooms; and the waitress in the cafe, who brewed a fresh cup of coffee for us and brought us fresh eggs just because she was being extra thoughtful. Amazing what a consistent, friendly attitude among the staff can do to enhance your stay. The beds were really comfortable too. I recommend the trolley ride to Manhattan Beach, $5 round trip. We";5
We had some health problems and Adam from the night desk was just great in helping us sorting things out. Great perfect service and friendliness. We felt well and save and had a better experience than in other hotels around LAX. It is a standard hotel for the area and is well equipped.  Will choose again when passing through LAX.;5
1) First key didn't work, went down to change it! 2) Second key didn't work, called security, they didn't came, I had to go down and change the key. 3) Safe deposit box was blocked. asked for help, they asked for my documents beacause some days earlier someone stole laptops from a room. 4) They charged 21 dollars to call a 1-800 number, I tried 3 times so at the end I HAD TO PAY 63 DOLLARS FOR CALLING A 1-800 NUMBER. NO COLLABORATION FROM THE LADY IN THE FRONT DESK, AT ALL!!! I may not be important but I am still a customer, they do not know the meaning of the word service!!!;1
Great hotel, hugh spacious rooms. Real Gem! We stayed in the Sheraton at the last part of our honeymoon and it was a lovely relaxing space.   Would highly recommend for comfort and cleanliness;4
The room was small, old, and with smoke smell, although it was a non-smoking room. The complimentary shuttle to the airport was too small, and many people had to wait the next one because we were too many. Fortunately, we were not in a hurry with our flight, because otherwise we would have to take a cab.;2
We chose this hotel due to its cost & proximity to the airport. The free shuttle was great, be patient - we waited more than 30 minutes and were getting worried, but it came.  Pros: - Proximity to airport - Free shuttle from airport to hotel - Very clean - Comfortable bed - Good sized rooms - Very affordable price - Check in and check out was very quick and hassle free  Cons: - Distance from city ($50 cab ride) - Bathrooms were not great (old, mouldy) - Restaurant- not the best food - Internet - expensive & only one computer in lobby -  Concierge we spoke with was not very knowledgeable  Would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend and would stay there again.  It is not a luxury hotel, but it is more than sufficient for the price.;3
The staff of the hotel is very warm and courteous, especially Elsa Zedinguil, she is one of the Supervisors. Not only she made my first experience walking into the door but also showed a very nice gestures with offering me a on the house treat. Very good experience.;4
Where do I start, Where do I begin with this experience, wow I think I should post some pictures of the extremely disgusting bathroom.. see below! Yes the room was so bad I took pics with my cell and took them to the front desk and guess what they did... OFFERED ME A STINKING FREE BREAKFAST.  Here are the details, the room was extremely outdated.  The hallway in front of my room had  buckled and sticky carpet. In the room was an old oak headboard, a filthy outdated bathtub with stained tiles, a waterstained and hairy stopper for the bathtub (YES I SAID A STOPPER!! OMG)  and moldy caulking, hair stuck to the shower walls and ceiling, and the AC unit was EXTREMELY noisy cutting on and off throughout the night and waking me up with rattling noise.    The bed was comfortable enough;1
We stayed at this hotel after a trip from Europe, the hotel is very close to LAX, it has a free shuttle from and to the airport, just ask to anyone who works outside the airport and they can tell you where to pick it! The driver was nice and helps everyone with their bags. The hotel was nice and clean, the check in was fast and the staff nice, we think there is a restaurant inside but we did not eat there, they have also an outside pool open till 10pm. We stayed there just a night so we have not much to say, the price was cool since we got it cheaper from a website, and is a good location if you need to go to LAX or you just arrived in Los Angeles but if you are a turist looking for a central accomodation this is too far from the turistic spot, mainly if you do not have a car.;3
"Stayed here for three nights (two with HW, one with hotel reservation) with my wife. For budgetary reasons and because I was working at a client site close by, we couldn't move but we definitely would have. HW gave this property 3 stars with 70% recommended, so we gave the FP a shot. Bad move... To save you the headache we had from staying here: don't ever consider staying at the Four Points LAX, unless you really have to.  What we liked: (a) staff was generally helpful; (b) Hotel has 24 shuttle service to the airport; (c) comfortable seats in the lobby; (d) nice looking furnishings and accessories in the renovated wing.  What we didn't like: (1) overall feeling of grime and dirt throughout the hotel, in the renovated lobby, the hallways, though not quite the rooms and most of";1
"Free internet service is worthless if you can't actually use it - very poor in room, a little better in the lobby.  A known issue, ""they're working on it.""   Although the hallways definitely need to be cleaned, running a carpet cleaner @ 9:30 pm isn't the answer. One bottle of free water a day, almost every day. Advertises Seattle's Best coffee in the lobby and on the cups in the room, but the coffee they give you is a generic brand.  Only a Sports Bar for food while restaurant is being renovated; for not so great, stale bread served.";3
"The location of the hotel is very convenient to the Airport. The entrance of the hotel was lovely but when you got to the room, the carpets looked like it needed replacing. The bed was clean, the wall papers on the wall were filthy. The bathroom floors were clean but again the wall papers on the walls were filthy, I was scared to even use the bathroom. The house cleaners entered my room three times while I was sleeping even though I had the ""do not disturb sign"" up. They called the room numerous times, came knocking numerous times and then entered while the ""do not disturb"" sign was up. Very unsatisfied while staying at this property!!!!";1
Do not stay at this hotel.  The pictures provided on the hotel's website are not accurate.  The lobby was updated about 5 years ago, but the rooms are original to the hotel some 20 plus years.  The only updating completed is new wallpaper and they painted the tiles in the bath.  The rooms are small, beds are uncomfortable, and the hotel smells.    Oh, don't forget to pay for your parking (16 USD).  Again, avoid at all costs!!!;2
"Here is my story.  I travel on business a lot so I have a great deal of experience with hotel around the world.  I always stay at the Four Points LAX when I am down in the LA area.  It is clean comfortable and close to the Freeways to get to where you want to go.  Let’s face it; you have to drive to where you want to go in LA.  This time I had not stayed at the Four  Points LAX for about a year.  I arrived without a reservation and approached the front desk agent.  I remembered him from pervious stays.  Now here is the incredible part, with the thousands of guests that they see every week he also remembered me.  Not just that but he remembered my favorite room.  Wow!  After a 500 mile drive I was tired and did not want to go anywhere so I went down to the hotel bar to get";5
On the last night of a business trip to LA, we stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX. Our flight the next day was very early, so we wanted to stay by the airport. The hotel looks like it was recently remodelled. The lobby is nice, but the hallways could use some work. You can hear people walking through the halls. It looks like it used to be a motel that was converted into a hotel. The staff was nice, and the price was a good value. The hotel offers free shuttles and valet parking is reasonable for LA. The free wifi was not very good, it times out often. There are other wifi options available for a price. There is another Sheraton very close by, which looks nicer and costs a few dollars more.;3
The hotel is situated in a very nice location, close to the airport. The hotel provides a free shuttle to/from the airport, which has no limit on how many times you take it and runs frequently, even throughout the night. The check-in process was fast and smooth. I was given a large twin room instead of a single room that I had booked. The room was clean and spacious. There is a free wifi in the entire hotel, whic worked very fast. There are a couple of stores in the lobby area, e.g. gift shops. The vending machines for drinks, snacks and ice are situated on each floor. The staff is very helpful and polite. I was able to leave my luggage with the concierge for the day and was also well informed about the surrounding area (restaurants, local buses,...). I wouldn't hesitate to;5
"Let me keep this short.  This hotel is disgusting, even by LA standards.  And the ""free internet"" is a complete lie.  For free, you get to share a tiny internet pipe that struggles to load a webpage and email is barely usable at all.  The rooms are dilapidated and the bathtub is older than what's in your grandma's house.  Its so bad, it prompted me to sign up and write my first review just to warn people.";1
My husband and I cant believe the Four Points can provide such an fabulous Hotel at such a cheap rate.  The place looks 5 star, and the Airport Shuttle delivers you right to the door fast and efficiently.  Our room was spacious with fridge, coffee pot and full cable channels Room service gets top marks for its service and meals too.  We arrived at 10a.m. (way before standard check-in time) exhausted from our flight from New Zealand, and were handled swiftly and courteously and permitted into our room right away.  We had two queen beds, both marvellously comfortable with huge fluffy pillows, sooo quiet and peaceful with blackout curtains so we were able to recover from our jetlag extra quick.  and the price???  Thats our secret, but It was unbelievably cheap!!!! Thanks so much;5
We chose this hotel b/c it's located right next to LAX and it's part of sheraton which we've always had good experiences with. Unfortunately, it fell well below expectations. The lobby looks new and remodeled, but our room, which was on the top floor, was awful. It looked like it was 40 years old with stained carpets, hairs on the pillow, and well-worn bathroom facilities. We paid less than $100 a night so it was inexpensive, but we were still expecting much more.;2
The Four Points Sheraton LAX is my favorite place to stay in the greater Los Angeles area, whether for business or pleasure.  The park-and-fly deals and room rates are great and the beds are exceedingly comfortable.  The property's proximity to freeway, airport, beaches, and local businesses make it a perfect selection for sleep, and the lobby bar with 100-plus beers also makes it a perfect place to host a business meeting or networking event.;5
The pics of the lobby are nice, but the hallways and rooms are disgusting.  The bathroom was filthy with clogged drains in the tub and sink.  There was hair all over the tub and it looked as though it has never been cleaned.  The carpet in the halls are stained and old.  The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything.  Restaurant was VERY overpriced for the quality.  Think of Denny's quality with $12.00 hamburgers. they charge their guests $16.00 parking.  Whatever discount you get on the room, they will get elsewhere.  I would never stay there again.;1
i got stuck in LA when i missed a flight and continental comped my stay here along with three meals. the front desk and guest services staff were all very friendly and helpful, although i think the restaurant staff could really use an upgrade. they were very slow to wait on you and also be warned the continental breakfast is $14!! ridiculous. other than that, the room was very nice and clean and the pool area and lobby were nice as well. there is also a shuttle you can take nearby for $5 round-trip to manhattan beach and some shopping centers.;5
We have stayed at Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport on many occasions. We have always found it to be clean, tidy and the staff to be helpful. It has a free, regular shuttle between the hotel and airport. On our last stay, the hotel restaurant was being renovated however the hotel bar offers an adequate range of meals. Free papers, and at times, fresh fruit are available on each floor of the hotel in the lift foyer. Four Points is located across the road from a Burger King and Budget car hire. For those who like Starbucks - there is one at the Marriott next door. The hotel has a pool and small gym with cardio equipment only. The best thing about Four Points is the flexibility with check-in and check-out. Our flights often come in late at night or very;4
I was not expecting much as so many hotels near airports are not great. I was pleasantly surprised. The room was nice and clean. I was very impressed with the restaurant food and staff. Thirteen of us descended on them without notice and they made up a private area for us very quickly. The service was great - fast but inconspicuous. The food came out together and was delicious!  They even changed the channel on the TV so we could see our favorite show!!!;4
My stay at the Four Points was perfect. I stayed in a Deluxe King Room. The beds were very comfortable, the internet was a little slow. The only gripe I have is that they advertise in the Dulxe rooms that they have LCD TV's. Actually, they have old 4:3 tube TV's. The hotel is surprisingly quiet considering it's close proximity to the airport. All staff were happy and helpful. Checkin was a breeze. The free hotel shuttle whisks you to LAX every 15 minutes. All in all, it's what you'd expect from a 4 star hotel. No real negatives at all.;4
"I booked a ""Deluxe room with 2 queen beds"", they gave me a room with two fullsize beds. I have food and beverage credit in the booking, they did not give me those credits. And it was impossible to have the receptionist to acknowledge that. ""Call Expedia"" she said to me, even if a Starwood preferred guest  The window of the room GAVE TO THE AISLE! Can you believe that? Look some other reviews, they posted pictures of that! No privacy at all, I had to cover the window all times. Carpetry is dirt, bent, from the elevator to the room. Vacuming is an option, walls are like paper, you can here everything.  The bathroom gave me a not so good impression as well.  Forget about the breakfast in the inside restaurant. Tried it the first day, never tried it again.  why? 14 dollars for a";1
Housekeeping is the worst I have seen in all my years of traveling. Vaccuming of the rooms  is not in their dictionary. Walls of the rooms are paper thing. When your neighbors shut the door of their rooms it shuts with a loud bang and shakes you up. Why can't the hotel have the door closers adjusted.  If you want to stay awake half the night go ahead and stay in this dump.;1
I staid for two nights in early May. Hotel is clean, room is good size, clean and with minimal noise from LAX next door. A couple of laptops in the lobby for guests. I forgot a book when I checked out and they immediately took care of FedExing it back to me. Very good for a business trip, great value;4
Whether looking for a comfortable nights sleep before or after a flight, or just want an upscale, but not too costly, hotel without all the flourish of a resort, the Four Points LAX meets your needs.  The biggest draw is the amazing price-to-value. Modest rates for clean rooms, a great bar, comfortable beds and decent restaurants - and a fanstastic gym.  You're unlikely to spend a lot of time in the hotel lounging, but there is a generic well maintainted pool that does offer food and drink service. Free LAX shuttle is included.  For Starwood members, the hotel is known for its excellent SPG recognition.;4
Smart workers are so hard to find. Very tired of dealing with dumb front desk clerks, very tired. This hotel needs to hire smarter people, but it would have to pay more. It's a catch 22 situation, I know. HIre smarter people, the room rates go up.;1
I checked into this hotel on Sunday, April 25,2010.  Martin Gil greeted me. Mr. Gil was very personable, kind, and courteous to my needs.  Although I found out the water would be off between 2am and 6am (4/26/2010), Mr. Gil did not hesitate to offer an apology and ask if there was anything that could be done to make my stay more enjoyable.    I appreciate that Mr. Gil was very attentive, personable, and kind. For frequent travelers like myself, I look to have as few interruptions as possible.  Mr. Gil helped to ensure that the interruption would not disrupt the enjoyment of my trip. Other staff and employees should model their customer service similar to Mr. Gil's.   Mr. Gil, thank you very much for your personable service.;4
My family stayed at your hotel on 25 April for one night on our way home from our holiday in California.  Our daughter lost her camera in the room, which contained all the photos from our holiday trip.  We called the hotel on the 27th April when we discovered the camera was not in our belongings, we called the hotel.  A housekeeping staff member was kind enough to do a thorough search of the room and found the camera.    It is rare when employees go above and beyond their duties.  We really appreciated her efforts and are very impressed with her, and as a result your hotel.    Kind regards, Elizabeth and Tony;4
We stayed here for a night before a cruise. The weekend rate ($79), made it well worth the money. As you would expect, it is your average business hotel. It was clean with good pool, bar and rooms. Nothing fancy.  Pickup at the Airport  was fast with a shared van (hotels share van service).  Some tips:  Restaurants at Marriott next door were pretty good. They have 3  If you rent a car, you can pick it up at Marriott (Hertz) next door. You can save $20/day on average vs an airport rental. Just take van to hotel then walk next door.;4
If you have need a room for a quick stay at LAX I recommend the Four Point: Swimming Pool, clean rooms, decent cafe, shuttle to the airport.  Great for a short stay.;3
Arrived after long flight from New Zealand. Shuttle was quick and they were helpful with the luggage. No problem changing rooms to good sized room with view of city lights. Food was easy and a high standard of service. After leaving, we discovered that I had left my handbag in the room as we were boarding our flight. We contacted Gloria Aleman, the Lost and Found Manager, who immediately found the bag, kept it safe and arranged with us to ship it overnight to our next destination. She was very professional and courteous and we felt confident that everything was well in hand. Thank you so much Gloria for putting minds at ease and helping us in a stressful situation!;4
I travel at least once a month for business.  This was the 4th time that I've stayed at the 4Points Sheraton in the last year and it was my best visit yet.  Check-in was a breeze, the  service in the bar and grill was very good, and I had a great night's sleep in a comfortable, clean room.  I had booked my room on a 'special rate' and was afraid that I was going to get what I paid for.  Despite the additional guests resulting from the flight delays related to the volcano (including the entire St. Catherine's La Crosse team from England) I was treated with exceptional service.  I'll definitely plan to stay here again for my next LAX trip.;4
the only good thing I can remember about this hotel (other than its close to LAX) is the guest laundry.  The rooms are small, unloved, and falling apart.  Sleep in the lobby, it might be more comfortable.;2
I was gavely dissapointed as I walked into the Sheraton gateway in LA Airport  , the service from the reception staff was terrible, and very dissapointing. However when I went to their sister hotel The Four Points, I was met like I was a old friend returning for a visit. The concierge and bell person were so welcoming, as I had arrived 3 hrs before check in, and wanted to store my bags. They took me to the reception desk and said there will be room available for me. I watched as Patricia Rior seved the guest in the line before me, and she is just what any hospitality company needs. She is absolutly great at her job and so welcoming and calming. I have stayed in hotels arround the world and this is the kind of service and attitude that every guest deserves. She explained;5
Arrived at 9.30PM and unable to eat except in a bar whhich served very ordinary food. We were in the older section and the problems we encountered were as follows: 1. Non-smokoing room that smelt of smoke due to the cigarete burnt carpet. Ther were as many as 10 burn holes in the carpet. 2. very small room. 3. No wring paper or pen. 4. No Hotel directory in room. 5. bathroom taps leaking. 6. Furniture in poor condition. WSe could go on, but won't to keep it simple.;1
It was a perfect to stay so close  to the airport and take the shuttle. Check in was very quick. The room was large. The king size bed was very comfotable. Nice bathroom..We enjoyed coffee in the room. Beautiful outdoor area with pool.;4
This hotel is terrible!   The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything around you. We were woken up quite rudely at 7am on a Saturday by someone blasting opera music in their room. All throughout the night there were people in the halls coming and going. They were loud, noisy, lewd, and sounded rather drunk.   The shuttle took forever to pickup from LAX and check-in was even worse.   We arrived exhausted and worn out from a cross-country flight and left even more exhausted from a night's stay here.   Go elsewhere. There are plenty of better options around LAX.;2
During my recent stay I received unbelievable hospitality from the Director of Operations at Four Points Sheraton at LAX,  I was staying one night and needed a conference room for a short period of time and he went out of his way to accomodate me.  There was no notice but he was able to help me out.  I will definitely recommend this hotel to any business travellers.  On top of this the room had all the ammenities with a nice little pub on the main floor.;4
"I was just in LA for an overnight stay and selected the Four Points due to its close location to the airport.   Would agree with most reviewers that the front desk is a little slow; typically had to wait at least five minutes, even if there was only one or two people in front of me.  Room was adequate.  Restaurant was OK but overpriced for what they offered.  Parking was also a little odd.  There was no real good way to get from the lot into the hotel.  You basically park behind the hotel and have to walk around the building to get back in.  Not much to do in the area around the hotel.";4
We stayed at the Four Points for 3 nights and had a very pleasant stay. The hotel was conveniently located across the road from the bus station so filling in our days was easy - half and hour in a bus to Santa Monica. The hotel was much nicer than what it looks in the pictures on the web and the staff were fabulous. I had a small mix up with the phone and they were very accommodating with my request. I will definitely be back here next time I am in LA.;4
The Sheraton brand is under attack at LAX.  The lamentable service of reservations (everybody reports a different check-in time) and deplorable service at the front desk (failure to abide by commitments, long waits, insolent service, incompetence) make this Four Points Sheraton a hotel to avoid.  For two Sheraton hotels built in the same year, the real differentiator between them is the level of training provided to and the standards by which they evaluate the staff.   This Four-Points is the runt of the litter.  Fortunately many other hotels in the neighborhood offer better service at comparable rates.  Avoid this hotel and think twice about Sheratons in the future.;2
Our flight was canceled for 24 hours and we stayed at Four Points near LAX.  The hotel is immaculate throughout, attractive, convenient, as pleasant as can be.  Our room was well appointed, really comfortable beds, bright and couldn't be cleaner or fresher.  The food is exceptional, well priced, too.  Everything is cooked fresh, the menus for breakfast and the other meals are well thought out and come out delicious.  The workout room was fine.  The swimming pool looked very nice too. The service was excellent.   The whole experience couldn't have been nicer.;1
After staying in a horrid place in Texas I was so glad to stay in Four Points! I only stayed for the one night but the room was cosy and comfortable and had two double beds for just myself. My room had a window which looks out onto the hotel corridor, so just make sure you pull the blinds down otherwise people will be able to see you! The hotel also shares the free shuttle bus with the Hilton, and in the lobby has a TV screen showing where the shuttle bus is currently at, which was brilliant for me as I was able to go to the toilet without missing it!;5
My wife and I traveled from Maryland to address some important family business in Los Angeles. We started our journey at 2:30 a.m., east coast time, to arrive at  BWI for a 5:20 a.m. departure. Neither of us had much sleep during the flight or on the way to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, we were able to get into our room right away, about 10:30 a.m. LA time. Trish checked us into the hotel. She greeted us with a smile and handled our registration in a swift, professional manner. Her greeting set the tone for the remainder of our stay. The staff in the hotel restaurant, where we ate our lunch/ dinner, then our breakfast today, were equally helpful, welcoming, and efficient.  I know some people might say that the staff was just doing their job. That is quite true. My;4
I parked at Four Points LAX and took their shuttle to and from the aiport and highly recommend this to anyone looking for convenient and economic LAX parking and accomodations.  At the very early hour I was flying out, it was crucial for me to have easy parking, friendly and competent staff!  When I returned, the shuttle was their in minutes and a friend and I had a drink in the hotel bar and caught up on some breaking news.  My car was safe and the bill was totally reasonable for days of use...thank you Sheraton Four Points at LAX!!!!;5
"just came out of an amazing hotel in Miami (Marriott Biscayne Bay‎)...  4Points Hotel by Sheraton LAX is ok - far away from the down town; however, you've got a grocery store, coffee shop, subway, McDonals and few banks in just 10 minutes away by cab (9-12 USD) Services is fine just got repaired my curtains that were hanging out of the rail - checking agents were not really friendly but they did their job - customer services counter in fine and the restaurant it's not that big - small bufe in the morning and a'la cart the rest of the meal. well.. hope it helps  cheers!";3
The rooms are nice but service is ok. They did not send any bellboys to take our luggage at the point of entry, and somehow there is a depressing air about it. The elevator is very slow........;3
i recently spent a week at this hotel and being a former hotel employee its nice to know a hotel has such professionals working for them. And liking a clean room i was glad i had Gisella who took great care in making sure my room was clean and stocked with everything that i needed. she was very professional and courtious and always had a smile on her face, which is good for a person traveling far from home. she  is one of many who work in the hotel with the same feeling for their work and they all should be commended for all they did in assisting me in anything that i needed during my stay.;4
I was stuck at LA for two days with some problems related to mi visa to fly to Vancouver, Canada. Musie Kahsay at the Sheraton Four Points LAX provided an outstanding guest service support. Friendly, very professional and willing to give that extra service that makes a big difference.  Thanks Musie for all your help.  Jaime Ramos;4
We were only here one night between flights. The free shuttle to and from the airport meant an easy transfer. We had an early morning flight and caught the shuttle back to the airport at 5 am. The rooms were comfortable and there was free internet. The rooms were a bit noisy though. We tried room service. The food was pretty awful unless you are into junk food.;3
We arrived at this hotel on July 9th and the minute we walked in everyone was so helpful and oh so kind! They let us check in earlier...we had flown in to LAX early that morning and the kindness never stopped for our whole 3 night stay. The staff made us feel special and welcome. We enjoyed our stay with this Sheraton and will stay there again if we go back to L.A. Thank you for letting me write this.;5
Good room, excellent service, shuttle runs to and from airport, restaurant at hotel, very easy to travel in and out of!;4
"My wife had a training class at the Four Points LAX so I went along. Since her company paid for the hotel room during the class, for the first night we were there we had to make a separate reservation.    Our flight from Honolulu arrived in LA at about 5:00 a.m. and even though we knew that maybe our room was not ready, we decided to try and check in.  When we first arrived at the hotel, it was difficult trying to find a parking space in the ""check in"" parking spot. Even though there was a sign that said ""10 Minute Reserved Parking Space to Check In"", we found out no one really monitors this.  We ended up parking in the ""No Parking Area"". When we went to the registration, the staff member greeting was okay. I understand it was very early, but try to have a little enthusiasm.";3
Book it if you need to wake up early to catch a morning flight from LAX and if you find some promo rate like I did ($75). The hotel is colossal but only one small bar in the lobby. If some food needed in the night - no chance, vending machines selling drinks only. Shuttle service is 24/7 fantastic - we only waited ~5min at 4:45AM;3
"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now & it never disappoints. No frills here but clean, comfortable & quiet. With its proximity to LAX and the shuttle running every 15 mins., it's very handy. The staff are very friendly & helpful. Plus, the In 'N Out Burger is close by. Also, there is a main bus stop very close (to get to attractions like beaches, parks, etc.) Also, the car rental places are all around the hotel.  I booked through Expedia & got a great price. I only paid $89/night this last time (in LA)!  1 Warning: Do NOT eat in the restaurant (one in front of the hotel). There is a bar, where they serve the breakfast, that is fine. I did notice this last time that the restaurant in front was closed. They are redoing it; hopefully it will be better. The food I eat there (Jun.";4
For the special offer of USD 69 (excl. comparatively high tax rates on top) due to denied boarding from an overbooked flight, and by the recommendation of an airline employee, we actually considered the hotel to be a bit better than it was. The rooms were okay, but at least 20 years old regarding furniture and looks. It was tidy and acceptable regarding hygiene although the shower did not really look inviting. In comparison to other hotels we had during our stay (Holiday Inn LAX) who had better rates, this one was way smaller. Big minus were the telephone rates they charged. Without knowing and being told about it we talked within California for less than two minutes via landline and paid a total of 23 Dollars for that single call. - Breakfast was about 14 USD for a brunch;3
I found this hotel to be clean, the staff  was friendly, extremely courteous, and helpful.  They went the extra mile for me! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Los Angeles area.;5
Having read some of thre more negative reviews on Tripadvisor I was concerned as to whether I had made the right choice of hotel for our first 2 nights of a USA holiday. I prepaid with Expedia and had a very good rate. We had a very short wait at LAX for the clean large shuttle with a driver who helped with bags. Check in was smooth and quick. I have an SPG card and we were given a very pleasant 2 queen room on the SPG floor. Overall the stay went very well. Drinks in the bar were more expensive than I found in other places but it was a pleasant place to watch sport. The room was comfortable and clean. Parking at  $16 was a little expensive but seemed secure. I have stayed in various LAX  hotels and this was on a par with most of them and at a very reasonable price. Excellent;4
Stayed at the hotel for two nights, the service was great overall. Am very happy and would recommend it to anyone. The free shuttle to the Airport helps in LA traffic.  The room was neat and tidy, room service was good but could improve the speed of service. Jess and Musie at the guest services were great. Special thanks to them.;5
This is a good place to stay overnight or a couple of days, no thrills, no surprises, very good services, nice-pleasent bar, kind personnel, excellent food at restaurant and bar, best beers to be tasted in the USA...and location perfect for travellers...  best recent experience was with the Concierge Jess: a package arrived for me 1 day after I left during my prevous stay, I informed Jess by e-mail and he kindly kept it even as I arrived back months later, maybe a minor effort but for me a major joy to collect my belongings...Thank you Jess, you understand the word: service and committment! Pierre;4
I arrived to this hotel at 8 pm checked in within minutes nice staff. All Non-smoking rooms, clean rooms, comfy beds, clean bathrooms, parking for 14$/day, we stayed for 4 nights 80$/night which is really cheap cause u can get a 1 star hotel with that price near the downtown of LA, we had our own car so the location didn't bother us at all, burger king, McDonalds near the hotel, free WiFi, business center to print out tickets and everything, free gym it was really good I went there every day with free towels and water, nice pool, it was really a great hotel for the price we had.;3
OMG!  It had a foul odor.  Something like cigarette smoke mixed with smelly feet and mildew.  Stained and torn wall paper and filthy - I mean absolutely filthly carpet and furniture.  Didn't even want to step on the carpet.  It's an airport hotel so those checking in late and catching an early flight have little recourse.  Really, what can you do under those circumstances after flying ALL day and having to fly ALL day again the next day.  PLEASE ensure you stay anywhere else.  There are lovely facilities just down the street.  We loved the Gateway Sheraton but would never stay at 4 points again.  NASTY!!!!!!;1
My husband and I stay at the four points sheraton. at least once a year for our visit to LA.  We wouldn't stay any where else we alway's get a great deal. All the staff is very nice and always very helpful with a smile. the rooms are so clean. We always walk in with a smile and a good attitude and we get it back. Thank you Sheraton staff. Lillie and Joe;5
Only there one night and can’t see why anyone would stay longer, but everything was fine.  Nice looking pool, good bar food (tacos, wings, etc.), 24 hr. shuttle.  Couple of places to walk to for fast food, but mostly it is surrounded by other hotels and the car rental lots …. I think the room was $75 .. clean and large enough.  No complaints.;4
"More than adequate accommodations/service.  Parking very easy.  ""Glass"" rather than plastic beverage containers (hooray!).   We've stayed here before.  We continue to like it.  Parking for Park/Sleep/Fly, however, is outside.  Our car was very dirty when we returned.";4
The property is close by LAX, it is reached through common shuttles shared with the Hilton (several of the LAX hotels use this system).  Perfectly adequate rooms, satisfactorily clean, very comfortable beds.  Bit of an issue with soundproofing, you may overlook parking lots and delivery docks where trucks backing up will be heard clearly, and some sound filters through from nearby rooms, but not specially noisy.  Definitely a business hotel, many meeting rooms.  Restaurant is OK for the price category.  ACE Rental car desk in lobby.  The shuttles nominally make the run on a 15-20 minute interval but traffic and number of passengers may affect it.  On departure there was a large family group with lots of luggage and the Hotel got dispatch to send a shuttle specifically for the;3
Excellent base point for an early flight. We had hire car so get around very easily (to Hollywood Blvd etc.) nice clean facilities, big comfy beds. No issues at all, peasurable stay reasonable price, free quick shuttle to airport at 6am. Recommended.;4
First off, let me say that I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum member (highest tier in their frequest stay program) and was shocked at the room I stayed in at the Four Points Los Angeles International Airport hotel. I can't imagine what the room would've been like if a customer who is not a top tier frequent guest would be like.   The room was located on floor 5, the Starwood Preferred Guest floor, and was tiny, the bath tub had mildew and the only window faced the hall were other guests walked right in front of it (see photos I posted). The fact that the only window faces an inside hallway meant that you had to keep the blinds closed or others could see into your room which also meant that you could not get any natural light nor get any fresh air. Since the window could not;1
I typically stayed here when coming in from east coast. With late arrival times 11pm id check in here , free shuttle, and then walk a block to hertz saving the rate of a 'good' hotel and car rental day. The renovated rooms are smaller, remodeled 1950's style rooms with lcd tvs, the tower rooms are fair, but larger and my preference. the conceirge bell staff is happy to assist in any way. while thsi is a big international tourist hotel AND airline crew hotel checkin can sometimes be long however they honer the Starwood hotel gold and platinum line so checkin is fast.  Usually an upgrade is granted with higher status, though hiltons include breakfast too at that level.  The property has sadly an undependable restaurant. SOem meals have been GREAT and others ..awful. They service;3
The hotel needs upgrading.  The airconditioners look old and are noisy.  The rooms are dim, dirty, the elevator is shabby and you can hear constant plane noise because the rooms aren't soundproofed.;2
We stayed for one night and really enjoyed our stay.  The bed is super comfy!  The room was very clean, tastefully decorated and very quiet, even with LAX.  Not once did I hear a plane.  Enjoyed the small fridge in the room, always comes in handy.  One complaint, the toiletries.  Smart look, but the fragrance is not pleasing.    All in all, a very nice and relaxing stay.;4
"Look for the red sign at the curb for the courtesy shuttle pick up area.  The 4 Points shuttle also services the Hilton.  It stops at the Hilton, then the 4 Points.  Check in was quick and efficient, although I was the only guest.  The outdoor pool is across from the check in area and looked to be fairly large with plenty of chair and lounge seating.  The carpets in the main hallways and rooms need to be replaced; they looked like the carpets in my college fraternity house.  The bathroom is dated and when I switched the water from the tub spout to the shower head, only 25% of the water pressure came through the shower head, leaving a gushing stream from the tub spout.  The sports bar in the lobby was the highlight with great burgers, an array of cold beverages and plenty of flat";3
I'm speaking of the Four Points by Sheraton LAX no less. The hotel is run like a very tight ship. Service is paramount as the rooms are well kept. In fact the hotel is now in the middle of a total renovation. The hotel offers 24 hour room service and a state of the art exercise facility as well as an outside swimming pool.  The lobby bar boast a beer lounge that feature beers from around the world.  My favorite aspect of the property is if you need something and they don't have it they will go and get it for you. It’s because of the men and the women of the Four Points LAX that InterBill Inc. and its affiliated parties and associates will continue to use the Four Points LAX for its future Conventions, meetings and of course leisure breaks;4
SPG Gold Member for years - needed somewhere close to LAX for the night.    When they did the refurb they should have installed decent double glazing to reduce aircraft noise (which carries on all night) and upgrade the plumbing and its ambient noises!  Come on guys there's a Marriott and Hilton across the road - guests have a choice you know!  Will find somewhere else next trip!;3
The price was GREAT! THe room itself was just okay but what was A+ was the room service! The hotel could use a renovation on the 9th floor??;3
We had a great experience here!  Maybe because I joined the Starwood preferred guest club, I got a great room on a good floor.  My only complaint about the room was no mirror outside the bathroom.  What do you do when your partner is taking a shower and you need to brush your hair & put on make-up??  Never before seen a hotel room without a mirror over the desk.  The bed was fabulous, chair was comfy, bathroom was great,  loved having a fridge!  An odd thing is having the towel rack inside the shower. I moved the towels when we showered or they would have gotten damp. Restaurant was a bit pricey. I did see the weird wing with the windows onto the hall.  Looked horrible and the carpet there was dirty.  When you make reservations, join the Star club or ask NOT to be put in that;4
"I was a little unsure about this place after reading the reviews online but didn't think it could be that bad, I was wrong. For reference I stayed in a ""Deluxe"" room with two double beds, I would hate to see what the standard is like.   The Good: The beds were comfortable, the room (not the bathroom, the room part with the beds) was pretty clean and fairly nice. The location was pretty convenient for the 405 and the airport. Couldn't hear the planes fly by. The lobby was nice.   The Bad: The window looks out to a hallway, not outside, so if you have the window open everyone walking past can stop and say ""hi"". This means you have to have the curtains closed which makes it feel like a cave. The hallway and surrounding doors were extremely loud. The tub and shower were pretty nasty";2
"The room had dirty and stained carpet, empty beer bottles lying in the room.   The hotel staff did not informed us about the additional parking charges at the ti me of reservation and we were forced to pay for the parking, which they advertise under ""other charges"".  The other surrounding hotels clearly advertise any additional parking charges.  They advertise free ""Wi-Fi"", which was extremely slow and the signal strength was very weak.";2
We stayed here in July after arriving from New York before leaving for Vegas the next morning. We only spent about 6hrs here. The service was prompt when we arrived quite late and the free shuttle was fantastic and easy to get! We really just slept here & it was clean comfortable and cheap!;5
I've never stayed in a Sheraton before. So, I was expecting something pretty nice. The lobby was decorated well and the staff was friendly and everything seemed fine until we got to our room and I saw the bathroom. The shower tiles had soap scum, indicating that it hadn't been cleaned in a while, the bath tub was rusty, the grout around the floor tiles was very dirty, the hinges on the door were rusty, and the paint on the bathroom wall badly needs to be redone. The rest of the room didn't look too bad, except that it was dusty. They did exaggerate the spaciousness of the room on their website. The walls were also pretty thin, as I found out at midnight and 2AM, when our neighbors were being VERY noisy. Also, we found out that parking was twenty-something dollars, so we waited;3
Stayed one night at the Four Points by Sheraton at LAX.  Bit of a dump.  Our room was pokey and you could hear the planes fly by.  The air conditioning was so loud it felt like a 747 was in the room with us.  The bathroom was small and dated and there was no room for anything.  The bath fittings were coming out of the wall and when you used them bits of plaster came off.  The restaurant was old fashioned.  Good rate at US$85 for the night but I wouldn't stay here again if I wanted a quiet night's sleep.  The pool was nice, the gym was fine, adequate.  Free shuttle bus to the terminal the next morning was good.;2
We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions - most recently in May 2009 for a week and in September 2009 or two stays of 3 and 5 days. We also stayed there in earlier years. It is much better following the refurbishment in 2008 It is a large hotel and has several very different types of rooms in different buildings. The rooms at the front which include 'Sheraton Preferred' floors in some cases face the street and in other cases face the pool or parking lot. Many, if not all, of the rooms in that building have been refurbished (2008) and are, in our experience, clean and reasonably well kept ( some omissions from housekeeping - odd towels or free gift 'cosmetic accessories' sometimes. They also have refrigerators, new 'comfort' beds, flat screen TVs, new 'IPod' clock/radios;4
I have stayed in many Sheraton hotels all over the world, as I am a platinum SPG member myself. But let me tell you straight: this hotel is just plain terrible. We stayed there twice, and both were terrible experience. To be objective, the room cleanliness was great. i liked the free internet. But the room facility control is poor, I can say. I was once very tired after my trip, just to find that the bathtub faucet wasn't working, and it took a hell while for them to put me in another room. Also, there is something about the front desk and restaurant staffs. The control over them, I may say, is so poor. Say, wouldn't you be disturbed when you are having lunch in a restaurant, and the janitor decided it's time to vacuum clean the restaurant carpet?? Or, in what kind of;1
"On a one night layover at LAX this hotel is a good value.  We started with a disastrous transfer from LAX; the free shuttle that was supposed to come by every 15 minutes left us at the curb for 50 minutes.  5 phone calls to the hotel later, the shuttle showed up and we got to the front desk where the manager was fantastic in apologizing and comping us drinks and breakfast.  (Shuttle is contracted by the hotel, not run by the hotel, so the manager's response was truly nice.) The bar is one of the best beer bars in LA - tremendous selection of over 100 beers.  Food?  Not so good in the bar.   The lobby/first floor has been re-done recently and is quite nice.  The guest room floors need the same treatment; hallway carpets are gross, but the rooms are comfortable enough.  Sheraton";3
My wife and I stayed at Four Points Sheraton for two different nights, one before a flight the next morning and at the end of the return flight.  Both times we were on a Starwood Preferred floor.  Carpets are old and worn.  Holes in carpet in room.  Dull and dreary.  Staff were helpful.   Airconditioning works fine.  Why don't hotels use blankets and bedspreads instead of heavy comforters.  Too hot at night.  Either turn down airconditioner low or take off comforter and just use sheets.  A small restaurant which we did not use.  Free bottle of water in room and coffee pot.  Otherwise food choices are slim.   We had no problems with shuttle, however, one of the stops was the Hilton LAX and the lines there were long and insufficient space on our bus.    I parked at Hilton LAX and;3
Four Points Sheraton LAX is a great hotel where the staff genuinely cares about making your experience as comfortable as possible. The check-in is prompt and the lobby is designed wonderfully to make it appear full of luxury. The hallways can be painted brighter but once you get to your room, you'll discover that the beds are very comfortable and the room (especially of a deluxe) is very spacious and well-decorated.   Cleanliness in top-notch and the service is great due to the friendly nature of the entire staff. The amenities include a refreshing swimming pool area as well as a gym with both cardio and weightlifting areas included. Palm Grill Restaurant is also value for money and internet access is provided throughout the hotel, with two public computers in the lobby. If;5
I picked this place just for location and thought that if it were associated with Sheraton, how bad could it be?  Well I was in for a huge surprise.  While the lobby is nice enough, once you go up the elevator, it's a whole new world upstairs.    The hallways line the perimeter of the buildiing meaning that all rooms have a big window facing an interior hallway.  That means you can't even open the curtains in your room unless you want everyone walking by to look right into your room.  It was worse than a cheap motel because the halls here are long and completely enclosed so you feel like a rat in a maze.    Secondly there were lights out in the hallway and the light switch to my room didn't work so I'm wandering in the complete dark.  As a former state trooper, it seemed like;1
The interior was one of the best designs I have seen yet. The vanity looks like it should belong in a showroom. The room was very pleasant and silent. Only one complaint is when I ordered room service pizza (spinach, roasted tomato basil), it had nearly a two inch layer of spinach! After removing it, all I was left with was crust and a little sauce. Overall, loved the area and the room, just be careful of what you order from room service.;4
My friend and I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of a round the world trip. We got a good rate and the reviews were good. Our main concern in staying in LA was safety and we felt very safe in this hotel and in it's surroundings.  It was everything you'd expect  from the name Sheraton. The rooms were immaculately clean and the cleaning staff were extremely friendly. The beds were very comfortable. The pool area was clean, safe and modern with plenty of sun loungers. They provided free wifi as well as two complimentary computers in the lobby area with internet. They also have a gym. The elevators were slow and in need of updating. When the hotel was busy you could wait ten minutes!!  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.;4
Stayed 1 night as a layover on the way to Canada. Location is good if you want close to airport. Shuttle service is also good and it is close to rental car drop off. Hotel is a bit old and tired but OK- exceeded my expectations. Room was clean and more than adequate. Good value for money.Service was also good without being excellent. As with the other hotels in the area they are only good for a layover to catach a flight next day. Stay in another area if you are holidaying;3
My family and I stayed at this property prior to our trip to the Caribbean in jUne of 09-I have stayed at many a Four Points and this one was outstanding.Very easy and painless check in-prompt bell staff got us to our room-a clean room no hassles-and surprisingly quiet for an airport hotel.They also have re modeled their GYM with all new cardio! They have their own dedicated shuttle to LAX which was also convient.All and all a nice stay.;4
My husband and I spent one night here pre-flight in May '09. Nice hotel & friendly service. Within walking distance to Wendy's, Carl's, McDonalds. We had to be at the LAX airport early, so we ate fast food and went to bed early.  Did not try hotel restaurant/bar, but looked inviting. Comfortable bed, big pillows. Bathroom had a hair dryer, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc. One complimentary bottle of water per day left in room (not 1 bottle each - just 1 bottle). Conveniently located  near LAX with shuttle service around the clock. Waited 5 minutes for shuttle. The driver helps with luggage and lets you off in front of your terminal. Our rate included 7 days of free parking.   We are glad to have found a nice park/sleep/fly hotel near LAX. Would highly recommend this hotel and;5
"Nice hotel but I would not say its the best.  Bathrooms were a little ""old"" style.  Location is great when leaving for LAX.  Car rentals returns were also very conveniently located.  Restaurant food was not very appealing.  Closest eating area is a good 10 minutes drive away.";3
I stayed here after a long-haul flight from overseas in order to get some rest before I took off on the driving part of the holiday.  It was great.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  The rooms were quiet.  The shuttle to and from the airport came quickly.   Staff were fine - not overly friendly, but fine.  The pool was STILL closed.  The internet was fine (certainly no lines at 3 am).  I did wish for a vending machine when I was awake and hungry due to the jet lag/time zone issues.    To some other reviews, I would say that this is an airport hotel.  It is supposed to be on the flight path and with nothing else around except for - the airport.  If people want ambiance, they should stay in Santa Monica or something.  But for a convenient, well-priced, clean and comfortable;4
We stayed just one night at this hotel as almost everybody else does, but as Starwood loyal prefered guest member, I won't recommend this hotel to anybody who wants to finish a holiday trip to California with a good night sleep and a smile.  When we arrived in Los Angeles, we stayed at Hilton LAX which I thought wasn't a really good choice and was happy that I had chosen for this hotel before leaving the city so I could compare both hotels and see which one of the reviews about hotels at LAX was correct. But I wish I hadn't listen to anybody and has listened to my own inner voice and the moment I saw the pictures and doubted whether or not to book here, to say to myself not to do it and look further around.  The front desk young man who checked us in, wasn't helpful at all, he;1
I am pretty choosy when it comes to hotels but I found this one acceptable for an overnight stay close to the airport. I didn't have to wait long for the shuttlebus and I didn't have to call to book either. It was quite convenient.  I didn't have any problem with the early check in (10 am).  The room is clean and spacious. Not noisy. A bit old but good enough. Good value hotel with free internet access.;4
"I chose this hotel because I needed an overnight locale near LAX for one night that offered a shuttle service from the airport.  I booked only a few days befoe my departure and prices were good.  Either the shuttle bus wasn't marked clearly or I wasn't paying attention--but I got on the wrong bus.  Driver was kind enough to ""turn off the bus's tracking system,"" go off his approved route, and drop me at Four Points.  He said it wasn't a really safe place to walk and he was right--it wasn't a BAD neighborhood, but it was poorly lit and consisted of mainly alleys and backs of hotels or hotel parking garages with no pedestrians whatsoever.  Check in at midnight was pretty seamless and fast.  Hall directions out of elevator were totally misleading.  I didn't expect there to be no";3
We stayed for one night flying out  the next day.  Rooms small size, one bottle water-free.  The staff was average.   The hotel is used. Late checkout was  until 3:00pm, had checkin at 10:45;3
We needed an airport hotel for 1 night between dropping off our hire car and catching our flight the next afternoon.  The time between the two was going to be long enough that we wanted somewhere with a pool to relax by and enjoy the last day of sunshine before flying home.  We chose the Four Points mainly because of it's nice looking pool and sun deck area.  Therefore to find out once we had arrived and checked in that the pool area was now under construction we were very dissapointed.  After scrolling through the information on our booking documents we did realise that this was mentioned and we had sadly missed it, however it hadn't actually been made clear on the hotels main website (fourpointslax.com) or at check in.  Obviously if we had realised this from the start we would;3
I've stayed at a few LAX airport hotels -- nothing in the area is really going to knock your socks off.  I have stayed at other Starwood properties in the area -- Westin LAX and Sheraton Gateway and was not impressed.  This 4-points was cheaper than both of the other options, and a better experience.  The room was not elaborate, but was clean.  They provide Caswell-Massey bath products, and the room was comfortable for our 1 night stay.  High-speed internet was free -- bonus!  We will stay here again in the future.;4
Have just left after a planned 1 night stay prior to an early flight out of LAX.  It's been several years since I was last here & those years haven't been kind to this hotel.  The overall impression is dingy & dirty.  Apparently they are renovating some rooms (just not those on the SPG floor!), though the room size will then be smaller, which is hard to believe.  I had a 2 DBL bed room on the SPG floor in the west tower & it is definately run down.  I'm not sure what they have done to the bedding since my last stay, but it's definately different & not in a good way.  The elevators for this tower are slow & stuffy-clearly the AC is not working in them.  All in all, I'm glad I only stayed 1 night (& on points on top of it!) & it's doubtful I'll be back.;2
We used this hotel to crash after landing from an 8 hour flight. It did the job, nice rooms, nice reception area with lounge area - great breakfast. Really close to airport and all car hire companies - complimentary shuttle service provided.  Restaurant evening meals were nothing to write home about - try some local restaurants nearby.;3
I had no intention of staying overnight near LAX but after my inbound flight was delayed by 8 hours I had no choice.  After confirming my outbound flight at 6:30am the next morning I wandered into the Delta lobby and looked at the hotels advertising board.  It was now dark, I was tired and just wanted a few hours sleep.  4-points LAX looked as good as any.  The staff were helpful on the phone and directed me to the shuttle bus right outside.  A short wait and a few minutes on the bus and I was in the lobby.  Check in was quick.  The lass on the desk was friendly and helpful.  I had to take the walk-up rate but it was OK to me.    My room was on an outside balcony.  I noticed some traffic and aircraft noise but a Normison soon took care of that.  The room was spacious enough and;4
I just made a fast visit to Lax and didn't wanted to get far away from Airport. The airline recomended to me this hotel.  Frankly the hotel fulfill all the needs, staff is friendly and room was perfect.  What can do better: 1) Business center is terrible, only 2 computers you have to wait 1 hour so you can use it, and when you are finally there, the next on the line is just behind you watching your spread, and making preassure for you to leave 2) The attitude of a girl in the front desk is poor, I arrived without a reservation she offered to be a $150 rate without food, her attitude was just like if she don't want me to stay I have to ask her a breakfast including rate and finally the rate becomes $115. The welcome should have been more kind.;4
I had to spent several hours waiting for connecting at LAX Airport and booked at this hotel to have some rest. I chose it mostly because of the reasonable rate they offered and was not dissappointed. I got a comfortable room, somehow basic but what I needed for a few hours of sleep and rest before going on my next flight. Staff was really attentive and I liked the complimentary shutlle bus to LAX Airport and internet wi-fi in the room.;4
The good: Little things do make a big difference! Nothing fancy but had a very comfortable stay without problems. Quick 5 minute check-in. booked via Expedia for 3 nights (got a deal for $71/night taxes included).  Rooms are reasonably sized. Fridge 2 phones in the room Free internet (easy to get on wifi) /bottle of water/printing/airport shuttle.  24hr check-in is very nice.  Friendly staff.  I initially was worried about the noise since it's close to the airport. Got given a pretty queit room on the 7th floor away from the runway. Only heard occassional planes during the day, not at night at all. Not much noise from other rooms either.  The bad (not much): Can't exchange my traveller's check. :-( Found a few strands of hair in the bathroom before I used it. Currently;5
The hotel lobby updated and very inviting.  The the rooms are barely acceptable: bright, spacious but plain, tiny bathroom though it has nice corian vanity top.  The big complaint I have and why I won't stay again is that there is a lot of noise and wind penetration through the old windows.  Each time a jet blasts during its takeoff roll it's like sitting outside next to the runway.   Same with buses passing by. And it was windy so could hear the air continuously whistle through and kid you not, even occasionally made sounds like one of those old fashioned hand operated horns.   Other hotels in the area have much better windows to control the airport noise.  Bring your earplugs if you are noise sensitive.;3
The parking ranges from $12 for self park and $18 for valet.  Keep that in mind when pricing this hotel.  The night before I flew out of LAX I had my car rental co., Hertz, drop me off and saved the parking.  The shuttle to the airport was great.  The location is very good if your goal is to be by the airport.  It is not near the beach or most of the So Calif tourist activities.  This hotel is older and has been renovated.  The center/oldest part must have been a tower hotel with external doors (like a motel).  They have gone in and enclosed those walkways so the windows are now inside a hallway.  Those rooms have been nicely updated, clean, neat, nice flat screen but overall not that desirable. I was traveling alone and the window in the hall didn't feel as safe, so I opted for;3
Don't let the outdated decor and shabby hallways fool you - the rooms are very nice and the restaurant is well above average for airport lodging. If you need or like a very large room, ask for something at the end of the hall. My room- 416- was huge.  This is also the easiest Wifi connection I have ever had in a hotel room- just log onl ike you would at home. And if you crave quiet, ask to be on the side away from the street. My prefered LAX hotel.;4
We booked this hotel for a park and fly special, it was about $199  (including taxes) for one night hotel and 14 days parking.  I thought this was a pretty good rate so I grabbed it for the night before we left for London.  The hotel is very close to LAX and they have a free shuttle to the airport that comes by about every 10-15 minutes.  I found this hotel to be welcoming and clean.  Lots of business functions were going on the day I was there.  There is a nice large lobby area.  The pool was closed for renovations.  Check in was very easy and they gave us early check in.  We were able to park the car (uncovered) and just leave it until we got back from our trip.  They give you a pass to put in your car to prove you have paid for parking in your rate.  Our room was small but;4
This is very convenient for a stopover as it has all the facilities you need from a modern hotel. There’s nothing else in the surrounding area except for a Burger King on the corner. The room was large, the bathroom was small but everything was clean and worked well. There’s no room safe but you get free WiFi. The restaurant and bar serve the same food which is decently prepared, not great but not bad either, and the bar has an extensive range of imported beers. You can hear some airplane noise but not much.  If you fancy a short day trip to Santa Monica (thoroughly recommended), the number 3 bus from the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus company passes right in front and the trip only costs $0.75, taking about 40 minutes.;4
This hotel is near the airport which is a plus and the restaurant is good.  The problems were: The Hotel didn't answer emails pre the visit, which were important. The swimming pool was being rebuilt and no one told us when we booked. The room wasn't made up and we had to ring housekeeping three times. They charged our credit card for services we haven't used after we had left the hotel and we had our final bill!  Nothing to do with the hotel but if you are staying in this area:  If you want to see LA quickly then do either book a city tour or take a local bus to the beach both worth doing.;2
We stayed here really as a stop over at the start of our round the world holiday. It was convieniently close to the airport, and operated a frequent and free shuttle bus service.  The hotel was nice enough. Nothing spectacular, but we were only looking for somewhere to stay for a day before we flew out again.  The room was a pretty standard in looks, but there were some nice points. The hotel offers free internet in the rooms, one of only two hotels on our entire trip to do so. Also the sound proofing was very good. The hotel is pretty close to the end of the runway, but we heard nothing. They also supply nice bowls of fruit for the guest nears the lifts.  We did have a fire alert in the middle of the night, and the staff seemed a little confused about what was happening. We;4
The Four Points by Sheraton LAX is very nice and economical choice for lodging by LAX.  The lobby and the rooms are recently remodeled and very nice.  The rooms have free high speed internet, nice beds, a nice desk, and are clean and comfortable.  The only downside was the pool was closed because it was being remodeled.  The room was listed at 65$ a night and would be worth every penny.  I got a free room with my starwood points.  The room was only 3000 points a great deal.  A word of advice:  ASK THE FRONT DESK TO STAY IN THE RECENTLY REMODELED ROOMS.  These rooms are nicer and bigger then the older rooms.  They are built with a window that is preceded by a hallway and another window beyond that.  While this design might slightly hurt the view (what view), it is great because;5
I stayed for one night when I was supposed to be in Las Vegas but they got snow and closed the airport (!)  Everyone on our flight was given a special rate and stayed at the Four Points LAX.  Check in was fast.  Room services took 13 minutes from phone to door.  The room was clean and comfortable.  I would not book this hotel on a leisure trip to LA, but would definitely book again for a stopover hotel.  There is a free airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes, too.;5
we stayed here on our trip to la, we were late flying in so convenience wise its great as its so near to airport but it is very basic accomadation.the hotel reception/lobby is lovely and the staff were very helpful but the rooms are awful, similar to a motel standard. i wouldnt like to stay here again;2
I stayed here for a few nights recently.  The hotel lobby has been modernized and looks nice.  I was on the 5th floor facing the back  which has a dumpster.  From the window you can see planes approaching LAX and the noise can be a problem.  I got used it after a while and it wasn't bad at night.  The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  It was promptly cleaned every day and a newspaper was delivered every morning.  The hotel is close to I-405 and other freeways and I did not have issues getting around.  There is a burger king that is within walking distance on the opposite site.  Self-parking is $12.  Overall it was a decent experience save for the noise of the planes.  But it is probably expected for an airport hotel !;3
I used this hotel as a stop over for one night, but for what I paid, it wasnt bad.  The staff were polite and check-in/out was easy and quick, no surpises.  The concierge helped us decide the best tour package.  The room itself was cozy, the washrooms were clean, and the maid did her job well.  The restaurant had nice food and a freindly wait staff.  I guess it could use some renovation work on the outside.  I picked this hotel for its location as we were flying back to T.O. the next day, and it definitely served its purpose.;3
We chose this Hotel because of the location to the airport ( 1 block) which was a plus.  The staff are very friendly and the rooms were very clean.  Parking is an additional $12.00 per night which is paid to the parking attendant when you leave. Hotel security is provided.  Overall, the hotel is nice but we did have some issues with a couple of things.   There was some kind of work going on in the room above ours which started at 7:00 am which I thought to be very rude and if we were not already awake I would have complained.  We ordered room service for both dinner and breakfast and each time it was awful.  The breakfast was the worst of it!  I had no idea anyone could screw up scrambled eggs and toast so badly!  The food was not cheap and we had to pay alot just for juice and;3
This is the last stay in LA because of my business transfer to Ohio.  It was very lucky we can have US$75/night ++ on SPG site for last memory.  Room and bed are okay, bathroom is kept very clean.   But something is not enough....  What's up?  The first, the area this hotel is belonged to is surrounding airport of LAX, and nothing special is here.   We have one dinner at hotel's restaurant and bar, but taste is poor, it maybe from my choice?   I don't recommend to others.  Carpark is very expensive, they charge us US$12 per each night even we are stayed here.   Some of uncertain people looks roaming about in night time.   It is a little bit scaring.  Ah, it is 11pm, I can see and hear jet plane's approaching to runway ( Jet plane's sound is acceptable ).   Nice full moon.;2
We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our 2 week holiday driving around California. Had already booked tickets to Universal Studios online, and was able to book transport through concierge at hotel. Not sure how good a price we got for this though. Bar/restaurant in hotel ok, food not bad, service friendly. Shower in room went hot/cold/hot. Pool closed while we were there for renovation, but it did say this on website when we booked so no problem. Overall, handy for late night arrival in LA, service OK, rooms adequate.;3
We were suprised at what we got for our money, this hotel was cheeper than alot of others in the area but still offered the same high standard. the airport shuttle was quick and friendly. check in was a breeze and the lady behind the counter very helpful. We were a little worried when the signs to our room number lead us outside and along a balcony overlooking ventilation fans but once inside everything changed. the two queen size beds were very comfortable and clean, the bathroom looked new. Unlike alot of airport hotels our room was quiet with no low flying aircraft noise. the food in the micro brewery was a little sad but the bar staff and choice of beers made up for it. i will be staying here again when in LA.;4
We stayed at the hotel for one night, when dropping our son off at the airport. Our room seemed newly decorated and was spotless.  Extremely convenient for airport, our price deal was excellent (cheaper than La Quinta which was vastly inferior and we had stayed at a few days before)  Our only  drawback was that the soundproofing between rooms wasn't very effective. However there was no noise from outside.  One added surprise was  that we had an excellent meal at the hotel restaurant (really!);4
This is a decent hotel with a good and close location to LAX.  We stayed here for two nights prior to sailing on Carnival Cruise Lines and to do some sight seeing in Los Angeles prior to our cruise.  We arrived right at check in time and were greeted by a friendly front desk clerk.  We were checked in very quickly.  In fact, all of the staff we encountered were friendly.  A room was nice, modern, clean and well maintained.  At first, I thought we had no bathroom.  The door to that is to left of the main door but the bathroom is tucked away behind the closet wall.  This is an interesting and great feature as it gives you a bit more room to move around.  The bathroom itself was a bit small but at least was clean.  The tiles on the walls and in the shower were showing some wear and;3
We booked this room using our Starwood Points for 2 free nights. I was a little hesitant to book this hotel because of the reviews, but we were actually very happy with what we received.   Contrary to the other reviews, the check-in staff were very nice and welcoming. The hotel itself looked nice as well. There was a medium sized pool, yet we did not go swimming so I cannot comment on that.   We stayed in Room 707 which was very nice with a King sized bed and even a lounge chair. This room also had a nice view, facing the street and LAX. Other reviews seem to mention the unsatisfaction of the room, but we loved our room. But then again, I may have been one of the lucky ones to get a nicer room.  As for parking, you have the option of valet or self-parking. I do not know the;4
"I am a skeptical person and have been skeptical of Sheraton Hotels for  years; the only good one I have stayed in was in Montreal.  The Four Points by Sheraton LA was a pleasant surprise! A beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms, very comfortable beds, excellent toiletries, a nice staff and best of all--an excellent restaurant!  The food was top notch!  Very surprising for a chain hotel!  The girls in the restaurant were warm and welcoming. They were very efficient and friendly.  The airport location is very central and convenient to everything in LA.  I would stay here again!  One minor quibble: the parking lot is inconvenient and off and not close to the entrance.";5
"Stayed here about 4 times prior primarily ""using"" the hotel for a convenient ""Park and Fly"" and ""free"" transportation shuttle to LAX when traveling. We have found it to be satisfactory on previous occassions. However, this past visit was quite surprisingly different in the room we were given. I had no idea the rooms could be so different only floors apart. This past visit, we stayed on the ""oldest"" part of the hotel - 3rd floor, outside corridor overlooking roofs and walls. The room was VERY small - barely enough room for the king bed, had a ""smoky"" smell, from previous smokers (hotel is now smoke free but still had an ""old hotel room smell""), and just seemed dingy all around. All of the previous rooms we stayed were located in the main building with inside corridors (halls) and";2
The two receptionists had little interest in serving me when I arrived. They were too busy talking about some television program. Eventually, I got their attention and one of them almost reluctantly took my details and gave me a key. When I entered the room I found a couple, enjoying themselves, on the bed.  Embarrassed, I left and the receptionist didn't seem to think it was a big deal and nonchanently gave me another key.   The room was what you would expect from an airport hotel. Smallish, low on features and a bit musty. The next morning I woke to the sound of a fire alarm. I threw on some clothes and people were standing around the hallway unsure what to do. We then smelt something and everyone ran for the exit. It was closed! Luckily someone said there was another exit at;1
Despite some of the negative reviews in Tripadvisor, we found this hotel to be clean, pleasant and (relatively) reasonably priced.  When we first arrived we were quite impressed with the decor and overall look of the hotel.  The reception staff were friendly and efficient.  They gave us an upgrade when we checked in and the room was really very pleasant.   There are much worse places to stay than this.  One major criticism is that they do not have any courtesy facilities.  This struck us as really rather poor considering it is an airport hotel and people (surely) want to check out late or have a shower and change before going to the airport, if their flight is in the evening.;4
and i stayed 2 times in this hotel not same room  next to airport/and hert next to fox hills mall and to marina del rey  possible to have corridors exterior from room car park: 12$ per day swimming pool warmed..good because not so warm in LA even in may!!!! small fitness center room are better in the new buildings but not easy when you smoke/buidings with corridor older, room a little dusty, but easy to go out and smoke coffee maker in room apples in corridors restaurant at reasonable prices and good but not really clean for place settings  good hotel to spend one night at arrival in LA or just before taking a flight;4
Shabby and expensive.  Poor airport transfer (infrequent and full, stops en-route). Room small and tacky, feet stick to carpet. Strong smell of deodorant/disinfectant.. Staff friendly and helpful.;2
I stayed at this hotel after flying in from England and had to wait for the rest of my party before continuing on our holiday. Having never been to LA before I was only told there is a shuttle outside the airport that will take you there. It was very simple to find as you just waited under a big sign that says Hotel Buses. After a short ride to the hotel I arrived to be greeted by a very helpful door man. The staff at the hotel were very polite and helpful. They even tried to help me trace my lost luggage.  The room I had was impressive. The bathroom was very clean with a large sink and counter top that would have fit all my beauty supplies had they been with me and not lost.   The bed was large and very comfortable and the room had more than enough room for just me. I suppose I;4
really good hotel in a really bad city ( la ) good food at a fair price and free internet pc use. its only 3 minutes from lax and what we couldnt figure out is how we could not hear the planes even though it was within the lax compuond. i would have no probs going back its just a shame i have no desire to go back to los angeles;4
I chose the Four Points because I've stayed in other Four Points that were very nice (Philadelphia sticks out in my mind). I stayed at the LAX property two nights while attending training in the vicinity.   My room was dingy. The bowed shower curtain rod with the wrong type of curtain caused water to leak on the floor in the bath. I had to go outside to get to my room - ala Motel 6 - which was creepy. I could hear the planes at the airport.   Bed was good.   The breakfast buffet was adequate.   We ate lunch there once -- big mistake. Took 45 minutes to get our order in a nearly empty restaurant. The food was cold and we had to wolf it down to get back to training on time. They added the gratuity into the bill automatically (we had a party of four).   The parking was inconvenient;2
Stayed at the Four Points for one night last month and was pleasantly surprised.  Check-in was simple and the room itself was decent.  What I liked about the Four Points was the location, right outside of LAX, the large bathroom, and the staff were very kind and  accommodating, also giving me a late check-out.  Would recommend for frequent travelers.;4
"Satisfactory accommodations. Clean & quiet with nothing distinguished about it. A large building with rooms. For an overnight stay waiting for a flight the next day, what else do you wish? Recommended but only at a hotwire price.  If you'd like a ""Sheraton upgrade"", another Sheraton (on Century Boulevard) a block away nearby offers much more including many on-the-premises food choices.";3
live on the central coast about 3 hrs away. This is a great place to stay to catch an early flight.  Check in/out is easy. Have eaten at the cafe and had a drink at the bar, both were decent no complaints.  Rooms are nice and love the beds. The bathroom is your basic sink and tub shower. Wasnt able to hear the planes out the window which is a plus.   My favorite thing is using their park n fly offer. park in their gaurded parking lot for about 15$ and you can be gone for 3-4 days. When u get back just take the shuttle to the hotel and go and get your auto. This was our 4th trip through this hotel and using the park n fly.;4
We were put in this hotel over night when our flight was overbooked, so my review may be a little biased by the fact I didn't actually pay for the room!  I thought the rooms were comfortable & quiet, the hotel was clean & the staff were reasonably friendly. Food & drinks were good & at a fair price. We didn't get to use the pool as it was raining. Free internet & printing was a bonus.  This is an airport hotel & as such caters for one night guests, I personally think it is a good choice & was much better than some of the airport hotels I have stayed in.;4
Used a day room here en route from Auckland to Stockholm.  Good checkin, more staff called in when queue began to lengthen, the room was big, clean and everything worked. Prompt shuttle service and the fact that a convenience store is over the road made it a good pick for a five hour stay.;4
The parking staff was a big cheat. They charged me $12 per day even though the front-desk gave a parking receipt. Now, the hotel can't find any record of my payment. So, i am charged $48 for 2 days of parking.  The room was smelly and looked like a road-side hotel. The room service was slow.   I would avoid this hotel.;1
This property gives one the feeling that a renovation was partially done but the owners ran out of money.  The rooms are decent with new bedding, but the dents and black marks in the bathtub seemed out of place even in a Four Points hotel.  Free or reduced price parking would ameliorate some of this, in my opinion.  Overall, this is acceptable for a night.  The location is quite convenient, though I didn't use the shuttle.  Instead, I rode the Hertz bus, rented a car for use the next day, and drove the very short distance to the hotel for the night.;3
Avoid this hotel at all costs.  I recently stayed at this hotel for one night on a layover to Hawaii.  The furniture was dated, the front desk person was extremely rude.  The halls reeked of a musty odor.  I must say this was not what I expected of my first experience in a starwood hotel.;1
The rooms are clean, the place is quite and it's the place to stay before an early flight at LAX.;3
A lot better than a Travelodge, but the age of the hotel shows, even on the starwood preferred floors. Check in smooth, hotel lobby is nice, they have FREE internet and and you can also print your boarding passes out for FREE. Nice touches. Hotel rooms was a great size, new sheraton bed was comfy, bathroom was spacious but the usual semi mold, old grout, etc. Could use some remodelling. Parking was 12 bucks, decent for LAX. Hotel shuttle is dependable unless you arrive after 11pm - then it is quite a wait. They are walking distance to Hertz, makes it easy. Nice, cute bathroom amentities. Good value, needs some new finishing but not a bad place at all.;3
"Horrible reception stating that we did not have a room after our credit card was billed and we confirmed the night before regarding our checkin - we were blankly turned away, until we called the hotel hq to inquire (demand) an explanation. Miraculously, the room that she said they did not have, suddenly became available (????)  This horrible front desk employee, with no class, repeated for about 7 times:  ""I'm sorry sir, we have no rooms.""   When the room was ""found"" she said ""I was trying to help.""  ""We told her:  ""you told us you had no rooms 7 times"" and we had to leave to call the headquarters from our cell phones. After a long flight from Hawaii, on our way to another longer flight to Paris, we were bitterly disappointed and would not recommend this hotel in terms of";1
We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in late October and were looking forward to it, as I had wanted to book this place at the start of our trip and just missed out. However upon getting off the lift we were bewildered as we could not find our room number indicated on the nearby walls and asked a staff member for assistance and they opened a rather shabby solid door to the external balcony.   This resembled the setup of a Travelodge hotel elevated several floors and in going into the room and in being in a Travelodge this feels like a Travelodge with better furniture. The bathroom is quite dated and the carpet has been quite dilapidated and there were several visible stains. The room also had an unpleasant musty odor.  Upon speaking to the manager he stated that as we booked;1
Stopped here 20th Oct after a long flight from UK.  Liked the shuttle bus from outside the terminal as we were very tired and saved on taxi fare. The room was very comfortable, big comfy beds with the number system to increase/decrease the firmness of the bed. good bathroom, coffee maker etc. Good view of the runways, but very little aircraft noise was audible in the rooms. Didn't eat  anything as we had arrived late UK time and we were getting a Hollywood  breakfast later. Shuttle back to terminal was also fine, as was check in/out.  Rate paid on their website was quite reasonable for LA.;4
We used this hotel for a one night stop over in Oct 2007. It was close to the airport and had a free shuttle bus that was shared with another hotel. This was easy to use and it ran regularly enough to be convienient.  The lobby area on first glance felt a little unwelcoming and 'cold' as in ambience not temperature. Check-in was OK, but the room did feel like a motel room as it was outside and accessed along what would normally be an indoor corridor but was actually an exterior balcony. The actual room was clean and tidy but a little tired in decor and feel, especially the batheroom. It was OK for a stop over but I wouldn't have like to have stayed in the room for longer.   We asked concierge for a taxi to Hollywood boulevard mentioning that we only wanted to be there for a;3
This is my second stay at the Four Points LAX. First visit was barely passable, but relatively cheap. This time, not as cheap, but still less than other LAX hotels. And improvements have been made. Bath amenities, towels, and room amenities have improved. Newer beds and linens are nice. Newer furniture too. But the hallway, bathroom hardware, and carpeting need to be replaced! Guess what, they were even painting the hallways when I left. Hope the improvements continue!;3
Stayed only for a very short period in the hotel. The staff were very helpful and the check in process took only minutes. I ate int he restaurant, prices were reasonable and the quality good. The room was very spacious with rooms for a fair bit of luggage in the entrance way. The bed was heaven, very comfortable. TV, cable all the things you expect from Four Points. Bathroom was clean and roomy. This is well worth the money for the short stay.;4
This is a very fine hotel. The room was large and very clean even had a little refrigerator with free bottled water. The prices at the resturant were reasonable. I had lunch there and it was very good.  Not a beer drinker but their bar features a wide variety of beers.  The only thing is I went down at about 10 p.m. and ordered a Tom Colins but the bar tender did not know what it was. This is a first class hotel at reasonable prices considering the area it is very near LAX.;5
Pros:  good basic amenities including shuttle from airport, free business center (internet, printing)  Cons: very thin walls, rooms that are outdoors (makes it feel like a motel rather than a hotel)  All in all affordable and convenient if you need to be close to the airport but don't expect a lot.;2
All in all -- one night stay, maybe.  Anything more than that and you need to find another place that gives you more luxury for your money.  I had to stay there for a week for business and I got the worst service I've had at a hotel.  Every time I came back to my room for the day, my card never worked.... and this was always when I had 7 things in my hands and I REALLY needed to use the restroom.  :-X  I asked if I could get a refrigerator as some of my co-workers had one in their room, so I was told they had a few and would check on it and give me a call back.  Two days later, I still hadn't heard back, so I called and requested again. This time, I was told there weren't any!  And this was during the week! Thanks for the heads up....  Also, I NEVER had internet access the whole;1
I have been lucky to get the nicer rooms when I have stayed here. There are probably 70 or 80 rooms that are outside facing the pool and these would be very noisy.  The rooms are large and comfortable and have nice updated furniture. The only issue I have is that when I put the do not disturb sign up so I could sleep in, the maids would call me to inform me that my do not disturb sign was on. Isn't the whole point of having a do not disturb sign is so that you are NOT disturbed?? That part didn't really make sense but overall I had no complaints about the room.  The only real turnoff is that the hotel doesn't appear to participate in Sheraton's Best Rate guaranteed program. I called the hotel hotline and told them I found a better rate on the internet and they asked what the;3
This is by far the worst hotel in the LAX area.  The room had no wireless internet connection and no wired ethernet access as well.  Shower did not have hot water.  Iron was busted.  Failed to give me a bill in the morning.  Failed to email me a receipt despite requesting it upon checkout.  Pool was closed for 'maintenance'.;1
I am writing this review from our room at the Four Points at 4:30 a.m. since I can't sleep anyway. As mentioned before, there is a corridor of rooms that are outdoors and we were unlucky enough to get one. Every 10 minute or so, a plane takes off or lands. The t.v. has such bad reception that it is not worth turning on.  The hotel is very full,and has the feeling of an overbooked cruise ship on a cheap cruise line.  The front desk staff was fairly bad and we had to wait for a valet to show up to get our car.  When I booked I had read the reviews here, but it was the only hotel I could find within 6 miles of LAX. Next time I would just sleep in my own bed, and get up early to get here, since sleep isn't possible here anyway.;1
Booked in here for 2 nights. This hotel is fantastic. It is clean and modern. Room was great with the most comfortable beds and pillows. Bathroom was clean as was the room. Room service was fast and reasonably priced. Pool was warm and average size. Staff were friendly and helpful. Easily caught a local bus to Venice Beach. Bus stop was only a short walk away. Complimentary shuttle to the airport was a bonus. Would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone stopping in L.A. before flying on to elsewhere.;5
Wow!! Overlooking the pool area was our room, number 348....just next to the New Nude Adult Shop XXX and Carls Jr.....we waited to leave from the moment we checked in. The gentleman at the parking garage yelled at us to 'just take ticket' as we entered the outdoor car park area. We were checked into a motel style room with an incorrect bed configuration. I called to switch rooms but was told the hotel was sold out. Was also told I couldn't acrue any starwoods points because I didn't book directly with Sheraton. Room not the same as posted online on Sheraton website. Very worn room, bathroom doorknob was not attached and hanging by a thread. Rust stains around bathtub. Decorative bed pillows were crusty and likely not washed regularly. We piled them in the corner and hoped the;1
Just recently returned from a 3 night stay. Got a really good deal on Expedia.  Couldn't fault anything, the beds were very comfy and no airport noise, nice pool. Just a couple of tips the Marriott next door has a Starbucks and sells cereal and milk for a cheap breakfast they also have a coin operated laundry downstairs .;5
DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! I booked a room for two nights.  I called the night before to confirm the reservation and they said they did not have one for me.  So I scrambled to find another hotel the night before our trip. This month I got my credit card bill and was charged for both nights.  When I called, the accounting department had figured out that they miss spelled my last name and therefore could not find my reservation.  Now, however, I am having a HORRIBLE time getting my money back.  The manager, Patty, told me this happend at least once a night!!!!!  But she did not apologize for their mistake.  After 5 phone calls, they still are fighting me on this charge!!!!!!  DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHANCES!!!!!  Horrible customer service!!!!;1
Had a 2-day meeting at an airport hotel which was booked solid, so I had to stay at another one close by.  The LAX Four Points Sheraton is not much to look at from the outside, but inside it's pleasant enough (especially if you can get the $95 government rate).  Big surprise was the room - comfortable, somewhat updated, clean and fairly quiet, considering it looked out over busy Airport Boulevard.  I came in late, exhausted, took a nice shower (toiletries are cutely packaged and quite decent) and slept like a log.  When I first checked out my room, I inquired about changing it because of the street traffic, but I'm glad I didn't.  I just cranked up the Air Conditioning and the traffic noise was virtually drowned out.  Breakfast room service was fine, and the Palm Grill served a;5
Got a good deal on a travel website for $99 for a delux room.  Room was clean and well maintained with a little wear and tear in the bathroom.  The Palm Grill was a surprising good deal with the pop corn shrimp starter really being a full meal.  Waiters were very fast and efficient which after a long day was appreciated.  Given we could see the jets from the window passing right next door room was surprisingly quiet;4
My daughter and I stayed here for one night last week.  I have stayed here a few times in the past.  My experience has always been good.  This hotel has a lot of international guests staying between, before, or after flights.  It is also is used by airline crews. The rooms are clean and quiet.  The beds have been upgraded and are very comfortable.  There is free HS internet in all rooms.  Airport transportation is fast and efficient.  The restaurant has quality food at reasonable prices with a very good breakfast buffet.  There is a very interesting bar that serves beers of the world.  It has one of the largest selections of beer in Los Angeles.  The hotel doesn’t look like much from the outside but is clean and well maintained on the inside.  Parking is $12.00 per day.;4
I booked my stay at the Sheraton Four Points LAX via Orbitz and was charged twice - once by Orbitz and once by Sheraton Four Points LAX. When I called Orbitz to notify them of the error, Orbitz informed me that the Sheraton reported that I was charged $300 for a cigarette burn to a duvet (I don't smoke, and had booked a non-smoking room.) Nothing was said to me about this charge upon check out, and indeed the room was in perfect order when I left it. I have notified my credit card company of the fraudulent charge, but my credit card company says it may take 45 days to dispute the charge.  I would seriously advise staying somewhere else.;1
"I only stayed for about 12 hours in between flights, staff was great, tv options great, even room service was good (burger was excellent), the rooms need upgrading though, showers looked a bit dirty, so did the carpet; at least the bed was comfy. I would only stay their for a few hours in between flights to be next to LAX, no other way.";3
After a long flight from London, The Four Points fobbed me off with one of their ultra tiny cheap motel style external rooms, which apparently they keep for people who book cheap deals on the web - so beware! The hotel is right next to LAX and with badly fitted windows the noise was unbearable as was the noise from partying Spring break youngsters in the next room. All in all, this was a memorable stay for all the wrong reasons! My tip, avoid the Four Points and book the Radisson at LAX as the rooms are much nicer and the hotel has decent double glazing. At the very least, if you plan staying at the Four Points, make sure you call them in advance and request an INTERNAL room, not one accessed from an outside corridor.  I for one will never be staying there again.;1
During my most recent stay in Los Angeles during June/July 2003 on a business trip within the Sheraton Four Points Hotel at Los Angeles I was the victim of a fraud by one of their employees.  When I was checking out I settled the respective bill with cash (approximately $75), rather than having it charged to the credit card I have registered upon check-in.  Before flying back to the uk I decided to take a few days in Las Vegas, where I stayed at the Hilton. I was initially alerted that there was an issue when I checked into the Las Vegas Hilton. The same card I had used in Los Angeles was 'rejected' as payment for the room.  I immediately contacted my credit card company in the uk, who informed me that a charge of $750 had been made to the card by the Sheraton Four Points Hotel;2
Everything was nice and clean, the staff very friendly and helpful, location very close to the LAX airport and shuttle included. The wireless internet connection (free/included) was a bit flaky, but the LAN cable in the room worked perfectly and there was a couple of computers with an attached printer available downstairs. The price was fair and the noise not worse than one would expect being so close to the airport. The bar had nice and not very expensive food (burger: $6.95), and if I had stayed longer, I would probably enjoyed the pool. It was of course not as new, big and fancy as the more expensive Marriott next door, but the room was actually bigger ...  So, I'll recommend this hotel. (You could stay cheeper at Motel 6 or something just down the road 3-4 blocks, but all in;4
Some of the reviews on here were a cause for a concern however I didn't want to spend a fortune for an after Midnight arrival for just a quick overnight stay near LAX.  I do not know if the entire hotel is as nice as the SPG floor, I simply went to the room I was assigned, it seemed like a standard room but it was perfectly pleasant.  Comfortable bed, good internet connection, clean, good location, no complaints.    Would I recommend this hotel as lower priced alternative for people visiting Los Angeles for a multi-day stay, probably wouldn't be my first recommendation.  But for people staying overnight near LAX its great.;4
Being a Starwood member, I expected a little more from this hotel, but honestly it was quite sub par even for a quick one stay while waiting for a connecting flight. The check in and registration were very easy and straightforward, but that's where the good stopped for me.   The room was dingy. The flooring in the room was very discolored, and not one I wanted to walk on without shoes. The shower in the room was ridden with mold, and needed a good cleaning.   I wouldn't stay here again.;2
I needed to stay at this Hotel the first 2 days as my actually Hotel the Holiday Inn Brentwood/Belair was fully booked The Check in and everything was fine, the room was large and comfortable. The pool was ok. It's a nice Hotel.;3
Where to start, where to start...For one thing, if you're a person not used to really huge cities, the neighborhood surrounding LAX may seem a little intimidating.  Huge buildings!  Lots of traffic...There are a lot of hotels in the immediate vicinity, but the area itself is not particularly upscale.  It's not terrible, and you won't be afraid to drive by yourself at night, but it's not like staying in a resort community.  Overall I thought this hotel was all right.  It was incredibly quiet, which as a light sleeper I appreciate.  The beds were comfortable and the room itself was very clean.  I had no trouble at all picking up the wifi using a Macintosh IBook (however, I didn't know there was wifi until my second night, as it's not advertised anywhere.)  The hotel has obviously;3
Had a horrible experience--coming from a person who stays in hotels 6 times minimum a year. As soon as I walked in I smelled a combination of an old person and cigarettes. It was appalling. After forcing myself to sleep, I yet smell more smoke coming from the linens. I felt as if I was sleeping in a run down motel. It was disgusting. The carpet was dirty and stained. The tile in the bathroom was falling out and clearly was not put in correctly. There was hair on the floor in the bathroom. The faucets were old and dirty. The hotel needs serious renovating. To  make matters worse, we waited for the shuttle that never came for over 25 minutes. We had to pay a cab $20 for a 1 minute drive to the hotel. Will NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. I was excited to leave in the morning;1
I stayed here for a night in order to catch a plane in the morning. Check in and everything was fine, the room was large and comfortable, as was the bed. The only problems were the weak wifi in the rooms (my computer couldn't catch it) and the fact they forgot to put bath towels in my room, which I didn't discover until after I had showered. I am still waiting for an apology or some sort of compensation for that, after sending them a complaint. This hotel is obviously old and has been renovated. I have stayed at the Hacienda, and I would recommend that hotel over this, if the price is better.;3
This is NOT what you would expect from Sheraton. The front desk people are not friendly. The room and the bathroom were NOT CLEAN. The bed sheets were THIN like a paper. The WINDOW  was facing the corridor and the curtain had to be left CLOSED for PRIVACY. The A/C was ineffective and NOISY. The breakfast was overpriced. Pick this one ONLY if you must stay at LAX and have no alternate choice but dont expect  much more than what you get in an average CHEAP MOTEL ROOM.;1
Arrived Christmas day at LAX and phoned hotel for courtesy bus. Apart from minor problem understanding where to pick the bus up bus arrived very quickly. Check in fine, staff courteous although first room shown had not been prepared. Allocated different room which was clean and adequate for a family of four provided you do not mind your children sharing a bed. Us Brits are not used to our children sharing a bed but in fairness to the hotel we did know what to expect. The beer bar was excellent with good tasty well prepared food and a huge range of beers from around the world. Prices for beer were not excessive considering the choice. We ate here 3 nights in part due to the lack of local restaurants. Parking at $16 dollars was expensive so we parked in a nearby side street taking;5
Was picked up by the shuttle outside TBI soon after arriving at LAX. Check in was quick and courteous. Room was clean and quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable. The shower/bath facilities were excellent. The room had all the facilities I needed for an overnight stay. Check out was very quick early next morning and despite a short delay shuttle had me back at Terminal 7 for my on going journey. Good value hotel for an airport facility.;4
Just returned last week from Los Angeles after taking a Mexican Cruise.  On the night before and the night after the cruise, we stayed at this Sheraton.  Beautiful hotel, comfy beds, clean rooms (we are very picky about cleanliness), great location.  Never have we experienced such helpful staff.......I actually took down the names of the wonderful concierge staff so I could mention them.....Teresa, Jess and Miguel.  They were WONDERFUL!!  They made our two and a half days full of great things....arranging transportation to Santa Monica pier, arranging shuttles for us to Disneyland, printed out maps for us, confirmed reservations for us, and even went so far as to drive us themselves to a wonderful Mexican restaurant called Paco Taco's because they had so highly recommended it;5
Due to an early departure from Lax to Atlanta, we stayed for one night in july 2006. Normally I would stay away from anything like an airport hotel, but actually the Four Points in Lax is a nice hotel, good service, nice rooms, pool and very close to the airport and next to some of the big car rental companies, which is very convenient, when you have to deliver or pick up your rented car. The noise from incoming aircrafts is what you have to expect, when you stay in an airport hotel. So, if you absolutely need an airport hotel in Lax, we can recommend Four Points.

We stayed one night arriving on 10/26/06 at 10 P.M. This truly  a great airport hotel for the money. We paid $119 for one night however, the rates drop to less than $85 on Fridays and Saturday nights.  The staff was experienced, pleasant and very efficient. The room was spotless and the bed & pillows were wonderful. The rooms are truly soundproof and we never once heard any air traffic or noise from any of the adjoining rooms.  The shuttle from LAX runs every 15 minutes 24/7 so you aren't waiting around the airport after you land.  We had the hearty breakfast buffet that included many extras including lox with lemons, red onions etc, corned beef hash and home fries. Even the pancakes were light and fluffy and the maple syrup was heated.  I would stay there again in a heart beat.;5
Stayed on a Friday night in October for a rate of $85.  The outside of the hotel was a little dingy, not what I remembered from the picture.  I was surprised to find that I had to pay $12 for parking, though it may be mentioned on the web site - didn't look.  Don't worry, the parking lot is protected from intruders by gobs of razor wire and the lot is illuminated for your protection with the ambience of a fine gourmet restaurant.  The lobby is quite nice and large.  Check in was reasonable.  I walked around looking for the elevator and had a look at the meeting rooms.  They appeared to be above average.  Up to my floor - 5th - and the worry sets in.  Not too pretty of an approach to the room, and the entrance to my room was on a long porch exposed to the open air.  Not a huge;3
Stayed here for two nights on the way home to NZ.  Found the hotel to be very clean.  Staff seemed friendly.  Ate in restaurant and food was fine.  No convenience store handy, but the local bus was two blocks away.  The hotel has a free shuttle to the airport and also to a shopping mall where they drop you off and come back and pick you up.;4
Good hotel for staying close to the airport. Not to much noise from the airplanes, although they fly close to you. The beds were very good and also the shower was of good quality! Nice people.;4
"We stayed at this hotel for the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend.   The hotel was very clean, relatively upscale, and the rooms where average sized. The rooms had all the essentials; hairdryer, ironing board, in room laundry service, soaps, free bottle of water per day, cable, internet, games and ppv. You can even view your account balance, charges and check out of the room on the TV.  Most of the rooms didn't have much of a view because of the layout but we never really stayed in the room that much so no big deal. The elevator did [--] and was very very slow.  The location was excellent. Right at the airport between the runways but we never heard any of the aircraft from the room. We did however hear the neighbouring room slightly.  There is a shuttle from LAX that goes every 15";3
My 1 week stay here was horrible and can be attributed to the lack of pride I feel the hotel employees had.  Here is a list of issues I encountered:  1)  My reservation made to the Sheraton reservation center was incorrect on check-in.  It took over an hour and 3 attempts talking to the reservations desk to get this issue resolved.  The front desk had no control over this situation and offered no help in resolving this issue.  2)  Restaurant service was marginal at best.  It took over 10 minutes to get service when the restaurant only had 2 other guests there.  Food was okay.  3)  Room service was timely in delivery, however it took over 24 hours to the trays to be picked up outside the room.  Food started to stink outside and still wasn't picked up after several calls down to;1
We spent 1 night here when we flew into LA and were very satisfied with the hotel and service, particularly for the comparatively low price.   Our flight from chicago was very delayed, so we only arrived at the hotel at 2:30am but we had no trouble checking in.  Even at that time in the morning the member of staff who checked us in was courteous and prompt.  Our basic king bed room and bathroom were clean, quiet, fairly spacious and the bed was comfy which are the most important factors for us for this one night stopover.  The breakfast buffet in the morning which was the usual fare was fine and not outrageously expensive.  As we checked out first thing in the morning we did not use any of the other facilities so I can't comment on the pool, bar etc although they looked small;4
Well, this is not what you would expect when you book something with Sheraton in it´s name.  When we arrived at the parking lot we found the $12 Parking/day that we already expected. Not nice but, well it´s close to LAX.  The lobby looked pretty good and the pool directly next to it (you could watch the people gathering there through the window on the opposite side of the registration desk) seemed appropriate. When we checked in, they couldn´t find our reservation at first, but after a call and a walk to the back office by the front disk girl, they checked us in. Traveling as a couple, we asked for a king non-smoking room and she didn´t objected.  When we arrived at our floor we had troubles to find the room. We had to walk through a door that looked more like a door to;2
We stayed 4 nights in April 2006.  The rooms are clean and bed comfortable.  If you are a Starwood members you are on the higher floors which always had a basket of apples right by the elevator door.  Great for snacking!  The workout room was small but met our  needs.  The rates were reasonable-$100/night.  I would stay here again.;4
Someone gained access to my hotel room while I was in the shower and stole my Rolex watch & cash from my wallet.  If that is not bad enough, the hotel's insurer initially denied my claim, but after repeated phone calls to the hotel and emails to the hotel and Starwood, they ultimately paid $250 for the loss of my watch, which amounts to only 3 .5% of the replacement value.  As a Starwood Preferred Gold member, I was extremely disappointed in the hotel's decision not to even attempt to compensate me for my loss beyond the amount paid by the insurer and and lack of regard by Starwood for my past loyal patronage and my future patronage.  The hotel could have compensated me for more than the amount legally required, but chose not to.  Starwood could have honored my email requests to;1
This is a great airport hotel. They operate free shuttle that runs every hour.  My room was similar to something at a Hampton Inn, but with much nicer bedding. I think they go overboard with too many throw pillows. Those end up on the chair. I needed a good night's sleep and that's what I got.  The management has thought of just about everything. Coffee maker, iron, pen and paper. There is free wifi, but it only runs 128k and I think that's shared. It's enough for checking email. You can pay for faster access.   Downstairs is a restaurant, bar and a large lobby with a big plasma TV.   I highly recommend staying here for a layover, or day room. However, be advised that aside from the airport, nothing is within walking distance. If you want to see Hollywood you should rent a car;4
We stayed at the 4 Points through Park Sleep and Fly for one night before we flew out of LAX. When we entered the lobby, there was a strong perfumey smell of cleaning supplies or cologne that was not pleasant.   The rooms were immaculate with a big bed.   The airport shuttle was very convenient coming sometimes less than every 15 minutes.   The Palm Grill Restaurant had terrible service! There was a convention going on which is probably the reason, but we were getting frustrated.    All in all, we would stay again.;4
This is a great location near the airport.  Not so good for sightseeing however you're not far from some great shopping centres, including Fox Hills Mall to which the hotel offers a free shuttle service.  The gym is small but well equipped, the cafe serves great salads and the pool is small but at least they have one.  Parking is an extra $12 per 24 hour period which is a bit annoying considering the rooms aren't all that cheap.    Service is good, especially the concierge desk.    The rooms are lovely with great quality bedding.  Quite standard size, nothing spectacular but very clean.  I've stayed here twice and would stay here again if I need to be nearby to the airport.;3
I needed a room just for the night and asked my travel agent to book me into another hotel near the airport.  For some reason, she booked me into the Sheraton instead.  And was I glad!  I had a lovely stay in a wonderful room, at a very reasonable rate.  The shuttle to the airport the next morning was very convenient too.;5
You’ll get no complaints about the Four Points LAX here!  We stayed two nights at the beginning of August and had a great time.  Our room was on the 6th floor (designated for Starwood Preferred Guests) on the inside (not overlooking the pool).  It was plenty big with a comfortable king size bed full of pillows and a nice-sized bathroom.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  We had no problems with WiFi (which is free).  Pool is nice (heated!) and is surrounded by comfy cushioned deck chairs.  Parking is $12 a night (with in/out privileges) to guests. Neighborhood is likely not one you’d want to “hang out” in but I think that is the norm for most airport hotels.  Location is easily accessible to LAX as well as all LA has to offer.  Enjoy!;4
Good hotel, meals and value  overall, as long as you don't  have Hyatt or Four Seasons expectations.      Rooms have fresh new furniture, carpeting, comfortable bed with lots of pillows - and the dining is surprisingly good.   Buffett breakfast has excellent fresh orange juice all you want, ripe variety of fresh fruits, hot and cold cereal, pancakes, scrambled eggs, decent coffee, bagels with cream cheese, even smoked salmon all for $11.95.   Staff is very accommodating and one doesn't have to wait most of the time for service - wi fi had a weak signal in my room but it's free, price is right, when are they going to step up with in room safes for laptop, valuables and cash not used during the day? - it's 2006 Four Points, match the offerings of other good hotels.    No;4
This place is horrible! The room smelled stale and it seemed like it was smoked in even though we requested nonsmoking and the place was really dirty. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk they apologized and said that it was a complaint they get all the time and can't do much about it because of the many rooms they have to tend to in the hotel.  I was afraid to sleep on their beds because of fear of bedbugs or just not well kept mattresses.  When I brought up the room situation I was given another room and it was better but our impression was already tainted.  It was a huge hotel and you just feel like you are another dollar and another spot to fill.  We weren't even asked how we enjoyed our stay.  Point in case...  another spot to fill... another dollar to;1
I stayed here in November 2005 in a Suite.  The suite was well-appointed, nicely decorated and comfortable.  I was very happy with both my stay, service and the minimal food and drinks that were ordered.  Very easy to get to airport as well.;4
I spent one night in this hotel in room 476.  Woke up with bites all over me.  Came home and found a coiuple of bugs on me. Yuck.  Then the creepy crawly feeling in my hair started, and turns out I had head lice -- now washing laundry, bedclothes, treating with chemicals, everything trying to get rid of them.  They may not be in all the rooms, but they were certainly in mine.  It was a one night trip,so I didn't stay in any other hotels.  I did make a report and they refunded $50 to me.  BE WARNED!  BE CAREFUL!;1
We arrived at the Sheraton after a horrendous flight delay and a crammed plane.  We were not in a good mood, but all the hotel staff we encountered- shuttle driver, front desk, lobby, restaurant servers, and housekeepers- were friendly and helpful.  Thank goodness!  Our room had one of the smallest bathrooms I have ever been in, and the place was worn, but the friendliness of the staff made up for that.  It worked out very well for us to cross the street and pick up our Budget car rental when we were ready to check out.  I would definitely go there again for the friendly staff and the airport location.;4
We arrived at the Four Points Sheraton at the end of our 2 weeks holiday in America We stayed 2 nights.  We checked in which was fine and fast and very courteous. We went up to our room and once out of the lift we had to enter our room from a veranda. We booked a king bed got 2 queens and teh room was very very poky and really run down. The view from the vernada outside the room was of a car park and a run down area. I went down staris and asked for an upgrade and told them i wanted a kign size bed. We were upgraded with out a problem. When we went to our new upgraded room with a view of the pool. We ended up on floor 2 same situation with the veranda anD NO POOL VIEW just the view of a roof top and air con vents. I cried for about 1/2 hour casue it was the worst hotel i have;1
I will never stay at this hotel ever again! I do not recommend it at all. For the price that it cost for staying there, their customer service stinks! You have to pay $12.00 per night for parking and sometimes there was no parking available (they do not have enough parking spaces). They make you park in valet parking and then they try to charge you for valet parking. You have to argue with them in order for you to get the $12.00 charge. My experience was terrible and frustrating. I left there with a bad taste in my mouth!  My family and I recently stayed at this hotel for four nights, but made two separate reservations because we arrived earlier than expected and we could not modify the first reservation (which that was not a problem). While there, I called front desk from the;2
Although the room was acceptable, the hotel did not honor my computer generated Park Sleep Fly contract and reservation deposit, although I went over it with them on arrival. When I came back 10 days later, I found that they had charged my credit card over $45 more than our agreement stated. The clerk at the desk had a numb look on his face, and although the supevisor assured me that it would be taken care of, and credit charged back, it has been a week of telephone calls. No call backs. The accounting department also has this invisible and cellophane type attitiude, where it sounds like they don't do business with Park Sleep Fly.  It's really been like talking to a brick wall. There is a definite language problem. The customer service at this hotel seems to display an;1
Stayed at the Four Points at the end of May for the DDW Conference.  The hotel is nothing memorable or spectacular, but is an acceptable place to stay if you need to be near LAX.   I read on this site that I should request a room in the regular hotel section, and not in the motel portion (room entry from the outside).  This was GREAT ADVICE.  We had friends that stayed in the Motel portion, and the room quality was not as high there.  Our room was clean, quiet, and tastefully decorated, and the water pressure in the shower was strong.  It's not a luxury hotel by any stretch of the imagination, but the Four Points has always been a low end Sheraton chain anyway.    The main restaurant on site had a good breakfast buffet and a decent lunch menu as well.  The pool appeared to be an;3
The only redeeming quality here is the carne asada at the restaurant.  This place is run down and in need of room renovation.  Room had a musty smell that they tried to cover up with some sort of sickening powdery/floral air freshener.  The tile grout in the bathroom reminded me of the bathroom in the dormitory in college - not pretty.  I probably should have asked for a better room but it was late and it looked acceptable upon initial inspection.  As mentioned by another reviewer, there probably are some decent rooms here....just make sure you get one, or be prepared to look forward to the check out process.;2
What a clash of extremes. From the outside, the place looked very Soviet-style housing circa 1967. Grim. And the parking deck? Even as a guy you could NOT get me out there after dark. But the public areas and the room were very clean. The room service food was fine. But what I liked? It was QUIET. Because of it's off-Century-Boulevard location, the HUGE hotels along that avenue block out the noise from that runway. I was at one of those properties the week before and by Day Two had come to distinguish the various throttle-up roars of various airliners. I could tell a 737 from an MD-80 from a 757 from a 747.  The internet connection in the room sucked. The cable didn't work. And the wifi SEEMED to work. I could get SOME e-mails but others, in fact the majority of e-mails that I;3
I have written reviews on this hotel before, this is an update, I have always enjoyed the hotel, However I never pay more than $89 I am a SGP gold so maybe I get better rooms, I never have had a problem, the staff are friendly and the room is clean. The internet is free and they have a nice pool. As regard to other who had their credit card charged, I would not think this was a problem (if it happened) as you could easily get it reversed by your bank. I had a smaller pronlem at a hilton so it can happen I guess. This hotel is always good to me , however they do charge to park, so take care on that. But for a clean place to stay its always been nice to me.,;4
WOW, not sure what the fuss was all about.  My stay was extremely trouble free and most enjoyable.  My reservation s was handled efficiently when I called to book my room.  It was exactly as described when I arrived.  The bellman who assisted me was very efficient, SHE, was by far a great asssest to the hotel. The check-in was a tad bit slow but once up at the desk the agentwere most helpful and seemed concerned about me. Upon entering the room I could not believe that this was an airport property as the beds were very inviting and made me want to jumpo right in. I will admit that the hotel is due for an upgrade but other than that, I will definitely stay there again when I am in the LA area.;5
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Four Points ""Sheraton"" hotel at LAX. We only stayed one night because we were in route to hawaii. I paid for an upgraded (""deluxe"") room $169 a night in order to get a king room.  Our first hotel room was much worse even though this one was awful, the first room you had to take outside in order to enter into your room... when we went into our room it smelt of disgusting cigerettes and the bath room was horindous. So my husband gets on the phone and asks for another room, they send us to (there nicer wing the east wing) first of all the elevators barely worked and as you are walking to your room through the hall way it smelt dingy and the wallpaper was comming off the wall from all the mold.  Then we enter into the room this room is a touch";1
The on duty hotel manager stole my credit card number and charged over $2000 to my card while I was on a 7-day cruise in the Pacific. I stayed here one night before departing for my cruise and this is the only place I used my card so I know it was compromised here. All I can suggest is DO NOT STAY HERE!!! I have been a loyal Starwood Preferred Guest for about 5 years now but I will never stay anywhere shady like a Four Points Sheraton such as the one at LAX :(;1
hotel room was kind of shoddy. carpet was pretty dirty.  we were offered a non smoking room which actually wreaked of smoke. pretty gross.  the housekeeping staff were very nice.  the crib was very nice and clean and modern.  pool was warm and nice.   take advantage of the free bus to manhattan beach;3
"If you visit their website fourpointslax it currently (March, 06) says they have an innovative service -- 24 hour room use. Their ""Services"" page says, ""This new option lets YOU decide when to arrive and depart, liberated from traditional rules that cramp your style. ""24/24"" guarantees your room will be ready, and held until you arrive, and you can keep the room for exactly 24 hours."" Since we had a late LAX departure, this was enough to make me want to book there.   I tried booking it online, but it said I had to check out at 3, so I called to book, and the call center said a hotel manager had to ok the request, and they'd call me back the following day. When no one called back, I called the hotel directly and spoke to reservations there. They said check out is always at 3";1
"At the last minute we decided to stay closer to the airport since our flight was early.  We checked other rates and found this to be reasonable.  When we first checked the rate, they said $135.  Then we came back and said okay we'll take it, the ""other"" front desk attendant charged us a cheaper price.  We were happy, it was only for the night.  We were in the back, close to the ice maker, the beds were nice and fluffy, and though we didn't need it we had 2 queen size beds.  The view wasn't anything to be joyouse about but we werern't there to watch the outside.    The staff was nice and cheerful and very helpful.  When we went to our car to get the bags, we realized we forgot our keys in the room, Security opened our door cheerfully, he was nice, didn't ask too much questions.";3
I had seen 6 generally good reviews here and 5 mostly not-so-good...    I arrived without my wife, as unfortunately our travel plans changed.  They informed me at the desk that I would not get my Starwood Points and I was disappointed.  They let me know that by using the website of SPG, or, even just walking in, I would have gotten a better rate.    I had requested a non-smoking room.  I got a smoking room (would have asked to change if wife was there).  Chose to accept it, watch a little TV, and hit the Beeer Bar/Restaurant.  There is, btw a charge for the 'special' TV, as well as movies, and obviously the internet access.    The Beer Bar was exactly that, with an enormous amount of bottle beer.  Some of the patrons, one in particular, had consumed too much.  To their credit,;3
We booked through British Airways for our last night before flying home, the room was clean, beds nice but had an exterior balcony / corridor so it was like sitting in a shop window as everyone walked past looking in, nice gaps around the door so you can hear the 747s as you watch them go past. Nothing worked, the shower control was loose and slipped round to hot continuously, the in room internet / movies / games service also didn’t work, nor did the aircon / heating, I used the business centre, any longer than a few minuets and it would be cheaper to buy a laptop, take the wrong lift and you end up in the kitchen, but the lobby was nice, I stayed at the Marriott when I first arrived in LA for three nights (through Airline network), why on earth did I book this for the last,;1
It never ceases to amaze me that the same hotel can result in such different reviews on TripAdvisor.  I almost wonder whether competitors post negative reviews or if different wings of the same hotel bring entirely different experiences.  (We stayed on the pool side of the wing along Airport Boulevard, FYI if you can specify.) We spent two nights over Thanksgiving weekend and found our room clean, the supplies complete, the hotel staff professional, and the location superb for our purposes.  This is a good place to stay if you want an inexpensive and comfortable location VERY near LAX. My wife and I enjoyed the comfortable bed (my pillow, however, had a mild unpleasant odor) and great location for a quick visit to the Getty Center in Los Angeles. We have stayed elsewhere but;4
We stayed here for 1 night after our flight to LA,it was a nice hotel the rooms were lovely and clean,the beds and bedding were fabulous and comfortable,we had a bath and a over bath shower. The rooms were well furnished.The pool area was clean.The restaurant was nice and the food was lovely and well presented,The breakfast buffet was very good and well priced with lots of choice,I am glad we were only staying 1 night as our room overlooked the loading bay and rear car park.It was a good stop over hotel and good value for money.;3
"What a dump this place turned out to be.  This hotel (should really a motel) is old and it shows in the condition of the rooms and corridors. The carpeting in the room and hallways are very dirty. Keep your shoes on! My room had no mini-fridge, and no microwave.  The clock radio won't turn off; I had to call room service twice before someone came up with a new one. The bathtub drain ran so slow that when I finished my shower, the water level was at ankle height. The only good thing I could say is that the linens were clean.  This hotel is sort of in the shape of a capital H. Do not accept a room in the middle (horizontal) part of the letter. This part of the hotel can only be reached via an external corridor. It is, in my opinion, the most neglected part of the hotel. At night,";1
Arriving for an overnight stay (not having pre-booked), we were made very much at home by reception. We received a great rate for the room and were offered a late check-out to coincide with our flight, at no extra charge. Room was good and spotless. Food in the restaurant was OK and again the service was good. If we travel that way again, there is no reason why we would not stay here again.;4
Stayed one night prior to a flight out of L.A. last week.  Wasn't expecting much for a hotel airport with a great price.  Boy, was I happily wrong! It's a very large hotel with the standard amenities.  However, the bar and restaurant were wonderful!  If you are looking for a hotel near the airport  in L.A., I highly recommend this one!;4
we had three nights at this hotel,they charged you for every thing,eg car parking 10 dollars per night,games console 6 dollars per hour.the rooms were a little on the small side,and not to clean.;2
We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of June, 2005.  The room we had was very good, especially for the price we payed.  The room was on the 5th floor, where a number of gold plus members are put.  The beds were good, the temperature control worked well. Not at all unhappy with the room. But do have to agree somewhat about the supplies. We had 4 people, 2 adults & 2 kids, in the room, & only 3 sets of towels.  They only left 3 sets of towels each day, so each night we had to call for extra towels.  The front desk staff was helpful & gave some good suggestions for restaurants. I also agree that the parking situation there is not the best.  Have stayed at this hotel a number of times, have never requested a specific room & have never had an outside entry room. I would stay here;4
"This hotel was not the quality you'd expect from a Sheraton.  The rooms were not adequately stocked with supplies (toilet paper, towels, etc.), and the iron leaked rusty water on our clothes.  Furthermore, we received a ""noise"" complaint at 6:30 pm, because an employee was trying to sleep,  and the only noise coming from our room was the television (at a normal level).  The maid entered our room in the morning when we were all still sleeping, without allowing time for us to reply to her knock, and when checking out, the staff was rude.  I would never stay here again, nor recommend it to anyone!";2
Please believe the bad reviews posted here!  I didn't and sincerely regretted it.  We reserved a non-smoking deluxe room 5 months in advance of our stay.  When we arrived, we got a smoking, tiny ugly, falling apart room.  To add insult to injury, we had arrived at midnight and were awakened by the phone ringing at 6AM for a wake up call we did not place.  This is really a motel, not a hotel, as the room doors open to the outside, which is not what you want when you are staying near LAX.  Please save yourself the misery that my family and I experienced the first day of our vacation, and stay someplace else!;1
I see this hotel has mixed reviews and I must say I have stayed here several times, I have never had a problem, now I am a spg member, GOLD and maybe that helps, I have stayed in the outside rooms and they are not the greatest, however the inside rooms are always fine, the price is good, its got free wifi , but you do pay for parking, I always stay here when I am about to return to Australia and upon my arrival, the sheraton lax is a much more luxurious hotel but its at least $30 more plus , internet, plus parking. If you want to spend a week then this is not the hotel for you, if its a day before or after a flight I think it great.  Make sure you get an inside room, some of the staff has problems with english , true, but do you want to have an indepth conversation or just a;4
I wasn't sure what to expect from this hotel for my 3 night stay.  However, I must say that I was delighted with what I experienced during my stay.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The rooms - wow - I must say that these rooms all appear newly renovated.  They are well maintained and extremely clean.  The beds are very comfortable.  All in all, the hotel is a great place to stay and is convenient to major interstates, and of course the LAX airport.  The only drawback to this place is that if you have a car, there is a $10/ day charge for parking the car - but that is to be expected anywhere near the aiport.  The parking lot is well lit and very secure.  If you are arriving from a long trip - the hotel bar is reasonably priced - but they don't have domestic beer on tap,;5
I stayed at this hotel for a job interview. The company chose this hotel and it made them look bad. My room was outside overlooking the garbage area. Just walking to the room made me feel unsafe. Once inside the room I found it to be disgusting. The beds were hard, it smelled musty and the bathroom was old and dirty feeling. I checked out.;1
"I love this Sheraton. The customer service is EXCELLENT... from the front desk to the parking attendent. Being a frequent business traveler, I like to feel like a welcomed guest. When in L.A. this hotel is my first choice. The new beds are so comfy; nearby beaches, malls, major highways,  U.S Post Office, Budget rental car directly across the street <no traffic/waits to return to airport> AND.. most importantly, they allow dogs! Oh, and let me not forget the Jazz nights, and the following day to relax by the pool.";5
The disaster started when the clerk, who did not speak English very well, gave me a key to a room that was already occupied... I walked in on a very startled man coming out of the shower. When I ran back to the front desk, visably distraught, the clerk did not even apologize and didn't seem to understand what had happened.  I finally got to my own private room, which was old, dingy, downright gross.  Then the phone rang at 4 a.m. with no one on the other end--when I checked out early the next morning, I was nonchalantly told that they were working on the phone system and must have been doing a trial by ringing all the phones--at 4 a.m.?!!!  As it turned out, my mother had tried to call several times and leave a very important message for me. The clerk who did not really speak;1
Lobby is the only nice thing about this hotel.  The entire staff was very rude.  I was unhappy with my room and they refused to change my room without paying more money?    When I booked the room they never told me that my room had a door to the outside.  They do have room with doors on the inside.  In addition, the room was run down.  I also called the front desk as the temperature in my room was 100 degrees and they began to tell me that my room was on a central bank and that there was nothing they could unless I wanted to pay more money and change my room.  This really was the worst experience I have had at a hotel in a very long time and I travel for business monthly.    I would really recommend that you think twice before staying at this hotel.;1
We just got back from Disneyland and at the end of trip we stayed two nights at the Sheraton Four Points before catching our flight home.  We were somewhat disappointed with this accommodation.  The room overall was quite small.   The shower and toilet area was so cramped that you had to squeeze by the toilet and get in behind the door before you could close it - way too cramped!  And the room also had a musty smell to it, particulary after you had a shower.  The bathroom also had a dirty feel to it even after housekeeping cleaned it.  The pool area was nice but no hot tub.  The restaurant was fairly good with a breakfast buffet that was good value.  Overall though the restaurant was a little pricey.  I also did not like the door to the hotel room opening up to the outside. If;2
Nice place to stay. Rooms were nice, clean and spacious. Staff was helpful. Only spent the night here so not much more to say.;4
I planned a regional event for 40 people and received a standing ovation at the end of the two-day session.  The hotel accommodations were excellent (all newly remodeled rooms) and the catered food was unbelieveably good.  The beds were extremely comfortable, and the staff bent over backwards to assist our every need.  If you ever need a moderately priced hotel for a corporate event, Phil Thomas and Joey Griffin at the Four Points will make you look like a hero!;5
Nice lobby disguises the motel rooms. Outdoor balcony leading to the rooms overlook the trash area of the restaurant and loud employee entrance. Free wireless internet doesn't work in the room nor the lobby. Hair in the bathroom and non-working HVAC. Never again.;1
We stayed here 2 nites, a week apart, as an overnite on the way to Mexico. The staff were friendly and quick, as was the shuttle service. The main restaurant is fantastic! Excellent food, good wine list, and friendly waiter. Will definitely stay there again for an overnite. It's not the area to stay in if u are in LA for any length of time, however. Anywhere near the airport is obviously not real nice. The rooms were clean and typical of American hotel rooms. The only complaint I had was the so-called beer sommelier they brag about in their online writeup. He was no more knowledgable about beer than I was, and wasn't terribly helpful either. Not rude, just non-chalant. And they only had 6 beer on tap! I come from a city in Canada with only 200,000 people, and we have bars here;4
Stayed here on Dec. 31, 2004.  I was looking for a hotel close to the airport since we were getting in late on the 31st, and I planned to pick up my rental car on the 1st.  I figured a Sheraton should be a good bet, but I was definitely wrong.  The hotel is certainly close to LAX (less than a mile) and the free shuttle and 24 hour check in was helpful, since we got in from Boston at 10:30 PM LA time.  The lobby was spacious and very nice, and the staff was extremely friendly and seemed to genuinely try to go out of their way to be helpful.  Once I got off the elevator on the floor for my room, however, my experience took a sharp turn for the worse.  Although the lobby is totally enclosed, the rooms are reached from balconies that circle the outside of the building, which greatly;2
This hotel had a unique and value-priced 24 hour check-in/out option.  Reserve directly with the hotel for the convenience of staying up to 24 hours in a club level room.  This is especially useful for early/late arrivals/departures.  Check-in/out was quick.  A 7th floor club level room in the east wing was quiet, clean, and comfortable on 1/4/05.   The staff was friendly and efficient.   The free shuttle to/from LAX is 5 minutes.  Calls from the courtesy phone at baggage claim went unanswered late evening 1/3/05.  But a call to the main hotel phone number was promptly answered and a shuttle arrived in 10 minutes.   Budget Car rental is directly across the street.  Pick-up your car in the morning to avoid overnight parking charges at the hotel.;4
Stayed here one night having decided not to return to the Furama after our initial stay.  What a difference at the Four Points- much better for the same price!;4
Definately, not the place to stay if you're looking for luxury and a nice place to stay.  Also, don't stay in this area of LA unless you're renting a car or just want to hang in the room during your entire stay!!;2
For the money, I found this hotel very good value.  I would recommend that you don't have your breakfast there ... go across the road to burger king where you'll get it much much cheaper. Not that I'm a fast food fan.  I was very happy with the room but found the reception staff a bit frosty.;3
Dollar for dollar a very good deal for the airport traveler Quiet, comfortable, and convenient. Parking is ten dollars, but when asked the attendants will let you come in and out all day if you have appointments. Good food, and clean. Not a bad spot for an overnight stay.;4
I've stayed at this hotel twice for a stop over on arrival in LAX and found it to be absolutely fine. If you book nice and early you'll get an excellent price and the rooms are decent and clean. Agree the shuttle bus can be a bit slow to turn up but upsides outway this. 2 tips for long haul travellers looking for a stop over. Never pick up your hire car until the next morning (this could save you money and definitely will save you hassle when your tired) & if your looking for some food/drink the Marriott is very walkable from this hotel (200 metre's max) and has an excellent sports bar to relax in.;3
The start And the finish of our three weeks vacation in US CA at Four Points was both times perfect. Price was exellent, so what can you expect!? Quallity was perfect!!! (for that price) Room with silent a/c Service of staff perfect. (Correctly speaking english) You must be thrifty not being satisfied on this hotel. Four Points, whenever we get back to LA You are ours!!!!!!!;5
I stayed at this hotel recently on my way to & from New York. I found the front desk & guest services staff to be helpful and courteous. The shuttle service was prompt and the drivers extremely helpful (my suitcase weighed a ton). Some rooms looked like they were being upgraded and whilst I didn't stay in one of those rooms I had no complaints especially for the price I paid. It was clean, comfortable and had fresh linen and towels. Room service was also prompt and the food was hot. I'll definately stay here again next time I travel through LAX.;4
The price was good, we figured it's only one night and the outside looks ok but they are doing renovation and the restaurant is in the middle of the lobby.  The hotel has 3 wings with it's own set of elevators and the hotel employee at check in didn't bother to tell us which elevator to take.  The parking is horrendous.  We had to walk around the hotel to get to the front or back door.  We asked for a no smoking room and didn't get it.  The only  friendly employee was the guy at the parking hut.  He was able to give us directions to where we wanted to go.  DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU ONLY HAVE $70 to spare.;1
We stayed at the hotel on July 25th, 2004. It was very good and quiet. Everything was excellent;4
The hotel / room is average, location of the hotel is good (close to the rental car pickup), service is ok.   Unpleasant are the thin walls and the staff who spoke less english then i did.  I stayed here on july 21th 2004 for one night.;2
We stayed here on 4th July 2004 for one night arriving at 8pm. Shuttle Bus pickup was quick. Check in one minute. We had two patio rooms on the second floor. They were clean and well presented. Staff were friendly and breakfast was excellent. We would definitely stay here again.;4
I got a fantastic price on my room, but it still wasn't worth it.  I arrived into LAX at 9:30pm, and my next flight was at 7:30 the next morning, so I wanted to get to sleep quickly.  I called for the shuttle from the airport and waited half an hour.  When I called back and asked where the heck the shuttle was, the operator got upset with me because *I* was giving him attitude.  When I finally got to the hotel, I had to wait in a line for 25 minutes.  They checked me in, and when I opened the door to my room, there was some guy showering in there.  So I had to go back down, wait in the line for another 10 minutes.  It wasn't until 11:20 that I finally got into my room.  Since then I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza - a little more expensive, but definitely worth the extra $10-$15;1
I'm actually a bit surprised by the bad reviews ... here's my perception. Nice lobby with wifi available. In the room, clean furniture, sparkling but small bathroom, room decor is average but fine, mattress was comfy, but there was no fridge which I could have used and the window was restricted from opening more than 2 inches. The staff was friendly, competent and accomodating. They changed my reservation to a 24-hour check-out (which I had forgotten to mention I needed when booking) at an even lower rate than I had seen on the net. I had a room on the second floor facing the front of the hotel so I could get the Wi-fi access typically available only in the lobby in my room - A PLUS for me. If you stay in the back part of the hotel you won't be impressed with the views AT ALL;4
We paid only about $70 for a night here, and frankly were very surprised that this hotel had the well-respected Sheraton name behind it. The place is pretty much a dump! We had to access our room via an outside corridor overlooking the parking garage, which lent to the cheap motel feeling. There was no mini-fridge. The walls were paper-thin, and we could hear entire conversations from the neighbors next door. Finally, the $10 parking charge for GUESTS, no less, was absolutely ridiculous. Guests should be able to park for free, with proof of their stay.;1
I've stayed at this property three times in the last twelve months and I have found it more than acceptable. Convenient to the airport and the freeways, satisfactory service, and great beer bar. After staying at the hotel I decided to check the reviews and was shocked to see the bad reviews. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest and perhaps I get a better room and better treatment, but I did not have the experience the other reviewers mentioned. You get what you pay for and this is not a place to spend your honeymoon, but if you're on business and need a airport hotel for the night this hotel is fine.;3
Stayed in this hotel just for one night. Flight was very late, easy pick up from arrivals, checked in quickly, room was adequate with free high speed internet access. Its grand to overnight.;3
"We decided to book a 4-day stay during Christmas. This hotel looked good from its pictures, but they were sure deceiving. While the lobby looked beautiful, the guest rooms were in horrid condition.  We paid $10/day for self-parking, but the parking lot was often filled to capacity. On more than one occasion, we paid extra to park next door at the Renaissance Hotel. We were given the run-around when asking for a refund of the Four Points charges. We later found out that the parking lot was filled due to a large number of people taking advantage of the ""Park and Fly"" packages! In other words, guests who were no longer staying at the hotel got the privilege of taking up the minimal space in the parking lot while the rest of us were stuck.  We had a room accessible from the outside.";1
Thoroughly agree with earlier reviews. Stayed here for one night.  Access to my room was from an exterior walkway, circa 1955, furnishings were shabby and the bathroom pathetically old. Plenty of noise throughout the evening with guests coming and going along the walkway and from other rooms and bathrooms made sleep difficult to say the least. If you are contemplating staying here do yourself a favour and don't.;1
Hotel had great rates for the new year and the pics looked great online. Lemme first say they checked us into a room that you had to go outside on the terrace to access. In the winter.. not fun. No heat in the room, asked for it be turned on and it took several hours to heat up! The room seemed old, tiles in the bathroom etc, so was quite shocked. However I called the front desk and asked to be moved which they did the next day (1/1/04). Our next room was soooo much better (or our expectations were lower?) very clean, looked new, even the t.v. was a newer model. Restaurant food was great, service at the bar was horrid, prices exorbitant of course, parking $10 a day for guests??  Won't be back but our stay was satisfactory for the price ($64/night).;2
We were assigned a room facing the pool. The room was very hot and stuffy. The airconditioning was not working. We tried to complain but it fell on deaf ears. We ordered room service and it was 1.5 hours late. We were bone-tired since we just came in from a transatlantic flight with my 2 1/2 yr old son. The room was old and in need of a renovation. Please stay elsewhere if you want to be comfortable. The internet connection was almost non-existent.;1
This hotel is gross. If you absolutely must stay here, by all means do not stay in the rooms whose doors face the pool. We were assigned a room in this area and had the pleasure of discovering old, dirty dishes from someone's room service outside our door, not to mention the moist carpeting in the room or the PUBIC HAIRS in the bathtub. We also tried to log onto the wireless network boasted about in the room brochures, but were unable to. We called the front desk and complained, and were given a new room in a different wing of the hotel. This one also had some nasty hairs in the tub - clearly someone is not cleaning properly - but we were too tired to complain yet again. Besides, the new room was indeed better than the old one, if just marginally.;1
Terrible service and the quality of the hotel is extremely poor. Stay next door either the Marriott or the Renaissance.;1
We stayed here because we were flying out of LA early in the morning.  Our room wasreally nice and very comfortable. We ate in the restaurant and the food was great. staff were very helpful;4
Our family of four had a fantastic time.  This is a great place for families. There were things to do for kids of all ages, including teens. Our kids (6&8) loved Star Camp! Rosa, Ismael, and Montse are the best!;5
Very nice resort. Traveled with a group of friends and we had a great time. However, the check in process is a bit tenuous and disorganized. We set up our reservations months in advance and asked for specific buildings so we could all be together. They said no problem, that is until we tried to check in. We were told that this is under local control and based on availability once we are on property. Then again another group directly in front of us in line got the rooms we specifically requested as they didn't like their locations, so it was available when we got there. Also I wouldn't recommend the Mexican specialty restaurant. Food was sub par compared to the regular dining facility. The food in the main area was fabulous!!! Beds were comfy and the A/C worked great. Dressel;5
We are on day four of our holiday and can’t say enough good things about this place!   The resort chain has made a commitment to reducing their environmental footprint, which means the grounds are returning to a more “jungly” state and the plastic waste is minimized. Those are huge pluses in my view. Add adorable little cottages for rooms, great pools, good food, and a busy, yet not over-bearing, entertainment team…and I’m thinking we’ll be back!!;5
Loved it. Especially Daniella and Julian  The food and the shows was amazing I reallly enjoyed my vacaction with all my family  Thanks for all the good attention of the staff and the beautiful amenities.;5
Was a nice spot. Seemed like a lot of people come to scuba dive which we did not. The snack bar was a nice spot for a quick lunch. Room was not super big but also comfortable for sleeping. Some said there room was hot but our room was also super cold.;5
We went as a family of 10 (all couples). It’s beautiful, amazing food, activities to do all day. The only thing I regret is not finding Daniela and Gabriela on our last day to say goodbye! They made this vacation even more fun and felt like family to us! They remembered our names all week and we learned about each others families. They were so much fun and on top of the location, i will miss them dearly. Fabian was also great-fun and taught us about the animals! Can’t forget Jose in the shop at the front! He took so much time explaining the different chocolates and what different candies were put out during Dia de Muertos. He was so patient and oh so kind. We will definitely be back (and hope Daniela, Gabriela, Jose, and Fabian will still be working there)!;5
Until last year, the Iberostar Cozumel always reserved the restaurant just off the beach as its evening steakhouse. They changed their menu about seven months ago and it is now a family style restaurant featuring pulled pork, beef brisket, pork sausage, and lemon chicken thighs. It was a complete and total disappointment as we were looking forward to an evening with a nice steak dinner at what the Iberostar considers to be  one of its upscale restaurants.  For what it’s worth you’re better off eating at the main dining restaurant and having a wider variety of food. Do not waste your time at this restaurant.;3
We just returned from 10 wonderful days at the Iberostar resort on Cozumel Mexico. This was our fourth visit in several years. We like this resort because it is smaller than some and mostly oriented toward adults since it is a magnet for Scuba divers and snorkelers.  Everything was great again this year. The grounds are well kept. Our room was well maintained and clean. Food at the various restaurants was much better than than previous visits but it was always good. The one exception was at the Oriental restaurant where the chicken in my chicken Pad Thai was tough as shoe leather. Everything else was very good. Service by the various staff was all good and everyone says hello or Good Morning and such when they pass by. Restaurant service was very good.;5
"If you are looking for a quiet place to chillax and unwind this is your place. Food is good, staff is AMAZING, environment is set literally within the jungle with bungalow rooms (no bugs), good entertainment, pools are large even when the ""cruisers"" come in, the beach is gorgeous. They have filtered water stations all over the resort. They filter the water and ice. You still dont drink from the tap. The resort is a natural bird sanctuary. Lots of excursions, recommend snorkeling as it's along the 2nd largest coral reef in the world.  We did the Bar Hop, deep sea fishing and dune buggy excursions. All were well worth the money. The shoreline at the resort is all rock so you need water socks to get in. Beautiful sunsets. There is Alberto's, just a short walk down the beach which";4
Such a wonderful time! What a great experience thanks to Julian and Gabriela!! They are the best!! Beautiful property with fun living quarters! Food everywhere, you are always taken care of!!  Numerous species of wild live on the property and a variety of activities for the whole family!;5
We had a wonderful stay at this resort. We have been many times and love the casual feel of the resort and all the nature.  We are divers also and have Dive with Martin pick us up at the dock.  I want to especially thank two people this trip who made this visit extra special.  Isabel at the front desk was awesome.  We had a minor problem at check in….but I was very crabby about it.  She handled it beautifully.  She was calm and a great communicator.  Thank you Isabel!!  Also my husband and I also had a chance to work with Manolo in the fitness center.  He was so helpful.  He is very knowledgeable and able to explain things very well.   We will be back;5
I believe this was our fourth time here. That alone says a lot. It's not a huge resort, it's quaint and quiet. They do a great job with food and the employees are outstanding. They are very quick to fulfill any needs you have. You can spend all your time there, doing things like snorkeling or kayaking or sailing, or take side trips to many other parts of the island with lots of activity options. The pool, beach and entire resort is very clean and well groomed. Staff that are excellent include Wilbur, David, Carlos Ruby and Luis for waiters and Gabrielle, Fabian and Daniella as activity leaders. Just plain paradise!;4
"We've made two trips to this resort.  (April 2022 & Feb 2023).  We've never gone to the same place twice, ever.  We'll go back here again too.  That should say a lot.  It's a sure thing for a nice vacation.  We went the first time with another couple as an escape from Covid.  We were done with all inclusive resorts, preferring to cruises or condos, but decided this was a safe choice with the uncertainty of Covid.   We had a great time.  The second trip was with our early twenties daughters as a family trip.  We picked the same resort because we knew it would ""fit"" for everyone.  I scuba dive, so that's always a challenge to find a place with diving and still have lots to do for the non-divers.  This place more than covers it.  First of all. I have to say the staff at the resort";5
We had a wonderful time at Iberostar, Cozumel. Highlights included amazingly friendly service, wonderful morning yoga with Manolo (both an energising, toning experience as well as a Spanish lesson with English translation!), super positive attentive kids club members (Rosa, Monserrat, Jordan) and a wonderful jetty full of fish for snorkelling, not to mention the fabulous sunsets! We enjoyed the food- so much choice. The Christmas Eve dinner was wonderful with lots of delicious seafood. Staff were so keen to solve any problems. The only thing I would mention is that our room was slightly run down with low quality paint work. And it seemed a lot of the apartments were similar. I think it would really benefit the hotel to do some high quality decorating out of season. I also felt;4
We tried the Catamaran and Zeus and the team was a good feel for snorklers or just stay at the boat and saw stingrays at the shallow. The Zeus team even served Beer, Margaritas and some guacamole snacks while we are enjoying the beach water! Muchos Gracias!;5
This was my first time to Cozomel and went with couples that have been going for over 25 years. This has been a relaxing and very enjoyable trip. Gabriela was very friendly and tried on many occasions to get my girlfriend and I involved in daily activities. She is a pure gem to the resort and the entertainment staff.;5
This place has taken major steps to reduce their footprint on the island of Cozumel and the ocean surrounding it.   By taking sing biodegradable products and keeping the landscape forested vs cutting it down made quite an impression.   This place is beautiful and sits comfortably in a jungle like forest.   Very tranquil.   The staff are amazing. They are always pleasant, no matter who you talk to. They go out of their way to make your trip memorable.   Evening entertainment was enjoyable.   We travelled with friends (7 of us in total)  We would definitely come back here again.   Loved it.;5
We have stayed at this Iberostar 3 times, in 2015, 2017 and this year (2023). The food has improved since 2017, the rooms have been updated, and the staff is still wonderful and friendly. There are many things I love about this resort. The cons are the limited number of beach loungers. My favorite  thing to do on vacation is to relax on a lounge chair, read and look at the water. I usually like to look for a place to lounge around 10am. It was difficult to find chairs available. It was impossible on the days when large numbers of people were at the resort on day passes. There were 4 of us and usually at least one of us couldn’t get a chair. Additional chairs would help. While we were there, the air conditioning was out for a day and a half. I am guessing that is was an isolated;4
We started this trip December 30 leaving from Toronto and going to Portland Oregon where we hung out with some friends for New Year’s and a few more days after that from there we went to San Francisco for two days and then drove down the Pacific coast highway all the way to Los Angeles Santa Monica from there we went to Japan where we spent 15 beautiful day is it amazing even though it’s cold and from there going to the Philippines. So instead of going home right away because of the 14 hour time difference between the Philippines and Toronto, we decided to kill the jet lag on the beach in Mexico we arrive to the iberostar on 16 February up until the 28th is a wonderful resort and the only reason I gave it a 4 to 5. It’s because the beach is not accessible to get in the water;4
Had a fantastic time with my group of friends at this all inclusive resort.  Although the rooms smelled a little musty when we first arrived, the resort was beautiful and had an assortment of tropical animals all around, including flamingos, parrots, iguanas and turtles.  The cleaning crew did an excellent job of maintaining the rooms and the main part of the resort was always clean and inviting.  2 Marias Tex Mex restaurant was delicious.  The pool bartenders, Adrian and Manuel made delicious drinks to enjoy in the sun.  Daniela & Fabian were fantastic event coordinators who took time to converse with the customers and make them feel welcome.  Reyes and Isidro in the lobby bar worked extra hard to make our night caps delicious.  Our check out day was my birthday and when the;4
Daniela, Manuel, Adrian, Isidro, Reyes, and Eduardo are some of the best people at this resort.  The banquet staff was outstanding, the care is top notch. I have been to dozens of countries and stayed in places from hostels to 5 star hotels, and this place has it all.  I will be back, no doubt.  Thank you so much!;5
We’ve never stayed at an all inclusive, and we were pleasantly surprised! We had 4 kids, 11 years and under with us, and Iberostar made it so easy! Food, camps, crafts, animals, snorkeling, swim, shows! Great food, and amazing staff!!! Could not have been easier, or more lovely!;5
I had a conference on the mainland but family and friends went early to dive. The diving was amazing.   We went to the fitness area everyday and met Manola Carmona. He was extremely knowledgeable about fitness but also the right way to train since he is also a licensed physical therapist. He took the time to map out the best exercises  for us, took us through the routine and sent us an email so we could continue at home. I expected to just have a nice workout with friends and left with a great plan that will help me in the future. I highly recommend stopping by the fitness center or one of his classes!!;5
What an amazing place! Over 20 of us were here for a week and couldn't ask for a better time. The hospitality and service was great. We enjoyed sitting at the beach, meeting new people and in the evening enjoying the shows provided by the resort. They have many fun activities that anyone can do. Gabriela and Alberto really know how to have fun with the crowd and keep us engaged. There are shows and games in the lobby almost every night. Don't be afraid to get involved. They might ask you to sing but don't be afraid, DJ Nancy has got your back. The bartenders and waitresses/waiters are better than any I have seen. Always checking in on you and your drink. Make sure to keep an eye out for Elisandra, her smile will brighten up your day. Overall the experience was amazing. We will;5
We just got back from our trip of 5 nights at Iberostar and our first time in Cozumel.  Some positives: the bungalow style resort and rooms make for a charming and quaint vibe. The entertainment at night was always fun and a wide variety from including the guests as the stars or bringing in live music/shows. The resort and rooms were clean. The amenities such as the gym were nice, we did not make it over to the spa. You could rent water sports (kayak, snorkeling) for 5 dollars for a 2 hour window.   The cons: if you are looking for a beach where you can get in and out of the water freely than this is not the resort for that, not many reviews talk about the rocky natural of the resort. You can swim in the ocean but you must walk down the dock to get there (or bring water shoes).;3
Manolo, our Pilates/yoga instructor was extremely impressive with his technique and leadership qualities.  He consistently reminded you to respect your body while safely pushing you to do more. Loved it! Highly recommended trying it no matter your fitness level.;5
"Iberostar Cozumel is one of 120+ properties in the Iberostar Hotels & Resorts chain. This was our first stay at Iberostar Cozumel; for the past five years we have stayed at Iberostar Quetzal at Playa del Carmen. We have posted reviews of Iberostar Quetzal here (https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d154883-r744922503-Iberostar_Quetzal-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html?m=19905) and here (https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d154883-r659684613-Iberostar_Quetzal-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html?m=19905).  A comparison of the two properties would be apples-to-oranges: While Quetzal has about 350 units (as does its “sister” property next door, Tucan), Cozumel has only about 60 units. Not surprisingly, then, Cozumel is smaller, quieter, more";5
We went to Iberostar for our wedding actually and worked with the onsite coordinator (Lina) and had a fantastic experience! The venue (on the beach) was amazing and the team there did a fantastic job, surpassing my expectations for the decorations, food, and flow of the wedding.   The resort itself is beautiful.  We specifically picked it due to the fact that all the rooms are in the bungalows (versus a concrete tower) and the resort has a focus on being eco-conscious and conservation. We also loved that you can book snorkeling/diving from the dive shop onsite as well as other excursions and loved the wildlife abounding (different birds, etc).  We stayed in the Presidential Suite during our stay which I highly recommend if you are doing your wedding there on the beach, as it;5
"My first time at Iberostar Cozumel was with girlfriends in March 2022. It was such a great trip that I told my husband, ""We are definitely going back there together!"" And so we did, along with my sister and brother-in-law, for a week in February 2023. It was even better the second time around!  Not only is the location beautiful, the grounds and landscaping alone make it worth the trip. Lush, green, and peaceful, with gorgeous flowers and even the occasional Coati family scampering around!  The food is great with lots of variety, the drinks are generously poured, and their specialty restaurants are very yummy.  But it's the staff that really makes it special. Everyone is so friendly, super attentive and willing to go the extra mile. The Iberostar app has a chat function where";5
"Our cruise had a stop in Cozumel and our family decided to get day passes to the Iberostar.  The grounds are beautiful.  We had breakfast, which had a lot of different options.  We wanted to use the pool and beach for the kids.  The pool is large and has a swim up bar.  They also have a nice size kiddie pool.  Our kids took advantage of ""Star Camp"", which is a kids activity area right next to the pool.  Our kids made crafts and played on the playground.  Ismael, Rosa and Montse at Star Camp gave our kids a fantastic experience.  We would definitely choose to stay at this resort next time we come to Cozumel.";5
10/10 experience at Iberostar Cozumel!! The employees are incredibly friendly as well as helpful! Ismael, Rosa, and Montse (for example) are very good with children and are always ready to help out. The food, activities, and entertainment are beyond good!!;5
The food choices are great, if you are an omnivore. If you are vegetarian, or heaven help us, vegan, your choices for your visit are going to be very limited. Questions about the ingredients of a dish are met with blank stares.   Overall, I liked my visit. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The Spa is remarkably over priced!! I think every one means well, but a few areas are missing.   Having alcohol part of the all-inclusive isn't always a good thing. I saw way too many visitors totally blotto, and acting like complete jerks.;4
After 7 stays at the Cozumel iberostar, this is the last. Started coming in 2004.  My friends that travel with my husband and me are in complete agreement that in the future we will look for an all adult resort. The rooms are clean, the food good. Atmosphere wonderful and tropical. However, we are past wanting to be around tons of screaming. Unattended children.  We understand the bottom line of any business is bring in as many as you can. We don't begrudge iberostar. We also don't begrudge families for bringing their families. However, there's precious little for teenagers to do here at the resort and I feel sorry for them here.

Ismael is a funny guy great to be around and Rosa and Montse were very helpful. The bartender Julian is very good and helpful he works at the front desk and always makes the drinks so wonderful and amazing.;5
Iberostar is the best hotel I have ever been at. The employees are very welcoming and helpful. The star camp members Ismael, Rosa, Montse are very nice and help with your little kids. Also Julian is the best bartender highly recommend him.;5
This is a great location, especially for divers.  The dive shop is located right on site.  They offer 2 morning dives and 2 afternoon dives every day which allows for lots of flexibility for scheduling.  The Iberostar is the farthest hotel south on the island and is right on top of the best dive spots.  If you do a two tank dive, they actually come in to the dock in between dives so you can go to the bathroom and get a water or soda.  Most boat rides to the top sites were 15 minutes or less.  Great boats and dive shop.  The resort is great, it's laid out in little 4 room buildings so it feels very private.  Each has a deck with a hammock.  The beach and pool were great, we were always able to find a comfortable spot (Mid December so hotel may not have been full).  The food was;5
Ismael, Rosa, and Montse are the best! They have great food and amazing views here. The bartenders (Especially Julian) are polite and make great drinks for everyone. They have everything you need here including a gym, spa, and snack bar.;5
amazing! love the star club, food, and entertainment. We love ismael, rosa. and montse . ANGELO IS THE BEST STAR MEMBER EVEN THO HES NOT HERE. Julian is the best bartender. highly Recommend. Make sure you participate in all activities!;5
My friends and I stayed here for week with their diving package and it was great. The suites were adorable and clean, good food, and friendly hospitality. The diving was also absolutely incredible. Would definitely come back;5
I was a little leery going to Mexico and had a hard time choosing a resort. We needn't have worried as this is an amazing place! All the staff are so helpful and friendly. The food was amazing, even in the buffet. We were surprised to see sushi and oysters some evenings as well as power juices at breakfast. You would be hard pressed to not find many items to your liking. The food was very tasty with lots of flavor. I think I ate my weight in fruit while there. We did not have any trouble booking our al-a-cart meals either. There is an app you can download and choose your restaurants and times at your leisure. Even if you change your mind on the time or location it is very easy to change it.  The grounds were well-kept and the rooms were cleaned daily. Bathrooms were modern with;5
We had a fantastic time at this fabulous resort. The grounds are beautiful, our room was clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything needed, and the food was exceptional. But the most impressive thing about this resort was the staff. Everyone went above and beyond to meet all our needs and wants.;5
I had a first-class instructor, Manolo.  He patiently guided me to understand various positions and offered modifications for a beginner. I felt relaxed and comfortable with trying something new. Look forward to returning and doing it again.;5
We booked our stay at Iberostar expecting a lively, engaging resort stay. The resort was clean and well kept but the crowd it attracted was not what I expected for the vibrant lively-looking hotel. We are an outgoing mid-30s couple and it was difficult to find any couples who were around our age to socialize with during our stay.   Entertainment around the pool and pool service was nearly non-existent. Pool bar staff were regularly disassembling their bar service at 5 when the bar closed at 6. . This resort really caters to the diving culture which is easily accessible through Dressel Divers (10/10!) right on the resort.   Aside from that, the stay and staff were less than entertaining. It was difficult to stay awake beyond sundown— which is okay sometimes, but not every night.;3
Our group of eight had the best time at iberostar Cozumel. The food was amazing as was the entertainment. The bartenders, Edgar, Ruby & Hojesus took the best care of us at the pool bar. We had so many great wait staff at the restaurants. The daily entertainment at the pool with Gabriela, Daniela and Julian kept us laughing and limber. So many great pool talks with them as well. Belly laughing is good for the sole!!  The snorkeling/diving is beyond awesome here. First time to Cozumel and we will definitely be back to this resort!!;5
Where do I start?   We traveled with another couple and stayed for 7 days.  Check in was the usual 15 -20 minute resort check in.  They have an app they ask you to download and check in prior to arrival which we did.   Don't waste your time, They redo everything anyway.   Then on to the rooms.  Not really any decorations in the room just a bed, two nite stands with no power nearby, a dresser with a couple of outlets and 2 non functioning USB ports nearby, a small table and one chair.  The bathroom looked like Stevie Wonder painted it but the shower worked great.    The doors to the rooms fit so poorly that our companions found a snake in their room on day 2 and then a frog on day 5.     The entire resort could use a good power washing.   On a 7 nite stay you are only allowed to;1
An Excellent teacher for Yoga and Zumba is Manolo!  Perfectly guided us step-by-step with kindness, patience and encouragement.  Manolo is a professional who gives extra care to your fitness level. ❤️;5
Wonderful resort.Relaxing well run.You will not find a resort more caring of customer service.All staff are friendly and willing to help with anything no matter how small the request.We had a few small things after torrential rain and they were resolved in minutes.This hotel is what an all inclusive resort should  be.Special thanks to Montse and front desk staff.She is bubbly and cares about the guests.i had the best hot rock massage in the spa.;5
I visited the Iberostar in Cozumel with my family (parents, brother, sister-in-law, and boyfriend), and while I would personally label it a family trip, we are all 27+ in age so I called it a couples trip for the purposes of the review. Even though we all typically have different travel/vacation styles, we had an amazing time! There was something for everyone to enjoy individually, and things we could do together. A particular highlight for all of us was the workout classes with Manolo. We all tried pilates, yoga and Zumba. Manolo was one of the best class instructors I've ever had. He is very positive and enthusiastic, and truly reinforced that every body is different. Every class was bilingual, taught in Spanish and English (which I enjoyed since I'm always trying to improve;5
My wife and I were initially drawn to the Iberostar Cozumel as a good place to vacation in the Covid era.  Every unit has a separate outside entrance (There are no elevators or hallways).  Many of the restaurants have one or more sides open to the outside, and nothing forces you into close contact with other guests.  However, we came to love it for everything else it offers.  The emphasis here is on the outdoors and the grounds.  We wanted to snorkel, and there are major reefs just off the resort including the “best in Mexico”.  Their snorkel trip was wonderful.  They do lots of scuba also, but we didn’t participate in that.    The beach is nice.  There are coral rocks just off the water line, so you might want to wear “swim shoes”, but the water is fine.  But we reclined in the;5
This was my first time staying at Iberostar Cozumel and our stay did not disappoint!   This all inclusive has a jungly feel with flamingos and a talking parrot, lots of birds, palm trees, banana leaves.  All the buildings have hut style roofs and brightly painted buildings, the rooms are spacious and very clean.  The grounds are well maintained.  We spent most of our time on the white sandy beach with beautiful blue water.  My boyfriend loves diving, he enjoyed having dressed divers on site to go out scuba diving 10 min from the resort.  He went scuba diving almost everyday.  I enjoyed several yoga/Pilates classes with Manolo, he is an excellent instructor and he took special care as I have some mobility issues.  He offered to help with some exercises to help increase my;5
Yoga with Manolo was excellent! The setting by the beach was beautiful and Manolo was calming and an excellent instructor! He helped with posture and mental peacefulness during the practice. Looking forward to attending another class with Manolo! <3;5
Second time staying here and absolutely loved it even more than the first. Manolo was our favorite, leading an amazing yoga class right on the beach, with the waves in the background. It was a picture perfect experience. Can’t wait to come back!;5
Love this place, and Manolo is super helpful and conducts an awesome yoga class near the beach.  Food is very tasty with a lot of variety.  A little rainy on day 2 but the staff holds many activities inside to keep it fun!  We plan to come back year after year.;5
Our second time at the Iburostar Cozumel. Had a phenomenal time! I would highly recommend the morning/afternoon yoga/pilates/dance classed with Manolo! My wife talked me into going to the classes with her (my first time doing yoga) and I had a wonderful time!;5
"I love this resort.  It is not the fanciest, but I love the Hut-like atmosphere and layout.  The only disappointment is the beach.  As everyone knows, that it is rocky, but I thought the water was very ""murky"".  However, when we went out on snorkel excursion, the water clears up, right away.  I don't know if it is because of the weather/wind but I don't remember it being so dirty 15 years ago.  If you are looking for laid back with good swim-up pool bar then this is your spot!";5
My fiance and I had the best time. Became friends with some other couples here and created lifetime memories. The entire staff was fantastic, always with a smile on their faces and very personable. Julian with the entertainment and activity groups was fantastic. We will be back!;5
We love this all inclusive. This is our second trip. We traveled with family and our 4 and 6 yr old grandchildren loved star camp. Best kids camp I have ever seen and the kids loved it.  Rosa , Ismael, and Montse were incredible!  The gym was also very good and we enjoyed Manola very much. He is a physiotherapist and also helped with our Spanish. He was very qualified.  The restaurants were all good with exceptional service and a callout for Cindy.  You can walk the beach for at least a mile. and we enjoyed the food station by the beach with ceviche and different fresh grill daily for lunch.  Service was great at all stations.  We enjoy the layout because it’s not a hotel setting but 8 plex huts everywhere. Rooms were accommodating but who wants to be in a room?  Best of all the;5
Julian and Gabriella were so great, they both made our experience memorable. We had fun playing the pool/beach games and enjoying the entertainment. Rogelio was also fantastic and provided us with great service!;5
"Not a dull moment.  We are not  resort people but this experience was excellent. The STAR FRIENDS gave great encouragement to try new things and relax the Mexican way. Food was Good.  Our favorite was the Japanese restaurant. Hats off for Julian , Stephanie Humbert "" supersexy and our favorite Gabriella. It was so interesting talking to her about life in Mexico . Gracias .";5
Everything here was amazing, how everyone was with all our group, the service for all the departments excellent… every day going to the buffet and have the table ready was great! The entertainment by Julian and Gabriela super fun, motivating us to participate in all the activities. The food in general delicious. I hadn’t been in a resort like this, definitely we are coming back.;5
"Buffets was by far the best food at the resort.  Fresh, very appealing and a great variety.  Specialty restaurants were less than impressive.  Their foods were average at best; even the Mexican restaurant.";5
We were looking for a resort property with a high quality dive shop and services on site. We were delighted to find a great dive & stay package with Iberostar-Cozumel and Dressel Divers. Diving was awesome, diving staff were exceptional. Staff at the hotel were very welcoming and gracious across the resort from check-in to restaurant staff, bar staff and concierge services. Accommodations were very comfortable and well maintained in a beautiful setting. Fun atmosphere and evening activities and we truly appreciated the focus on sustainability.;5
We have loved every minute, aerobics with Gabriela and Julian were so fun. Food has been delicious anywhere we ate and we would return 😋 in a heartbeat!! All my group was enjoying the trip... ❤️❤️🥳🎂;5
We’ve been traveling for the past seven years and twice a years for the past 5.  This clearly is a favorite.  Isabel at the front desk has taken very good care of us.  I would highly recommend asking for her, she does a great job helping with whatever you need as far as rooms or other issues.  We love the buffets and have made friends with several waiters and waitresses.  Cindy is our favorite we love her and her beautiful smile..  We even stay in touch throughout the year with her and her family.  For dinner we love Wilbert, he always takes good care of us too! Each visit they all make you feel like you’re home.  There have been a number of changes in staff in the last few years that we feel is sad.  A lot of other familiar faces we enjoyed seeing are no longer there, Angelo;5
First I want to thank Isabel for always making the check in process so easy.  She always goes out of her way to be as accommodating and helpful as she can, which is so appreciated after a long day of travel.   I would also like to thank Cindy who makes every breakfast and lunch great. She goes out of her way to take care of us and makes us feel like family.   Rooms are clean and fridge is stocked daily. The grounds are well kept with beautiful plants and flowers.  We don’t make reservations at the restaurants because there’s plenty of great food at the buffets.   Normally we dive with Dressels, but decided against them this time because we didn’t feel safe on our last visits.  We went with Scuba Tony and they were awesome!! Highly recommend… we felt very spoiled.  Maximum 6;5
It was a nice time but we had a few issues. We stayed 11 nights.    This was my second visit and I brought my mom for her first time here. This place is absolutely beautiful and unique and the staff is so friendly and helpful. Check in was good and the new room keys n the all-inclusive bracelet are FANTASTIC. Food was really good. We did the Asian place twice and the Mexican twice, buffet the other nights. The desserts are wonderful and there were nights we tried 5 or 6 different ones…haha    Argely was our favorite beach waitress. She was just so sweet and attentive. She made our stay so much better!!! We did a few days by the pool and enjoyed the games and entertainment staff quite a lot, which I can’t say I’ve ever said before. The beach here is wonderful and the water is;4
This was our second time there. We will not go back.  Food was a great disappointment. We expected food like soup, pizza, pastas, sauces etc,., to be hot but was served barely warm or cold. Very limited fish selections - mostly Tilapia. This applies to the three al a carte restaurants as well.   Beach was NEVER cleaned. The lounge chairs never cleaned or set up for the morning. We saw the same pieces of garbage in the sand for the whole week. There was exposed electrical wiring in the sand beside the seating areas due to broken conduits. The stairs into the ocean off the dock have broken steps - very dangerous and unsafe.  Understaffed at the bars - long lineups to get a drink, especially when the hotel welcomes day trippers from the MANY cruise ships to swarm the beaches,;2
Great fun and proper instructions for zumba yoga and pilates with Manolo. He has such energy but also knowledge to guide us.  Recommended and also the overall hotel experience as such a beautiful place.;5
Manolo offered wonderful classes. I only attended yoga and Pilates but I’m sure his other classes, such a Zumba, are just as great! Starting my day with manolo was the highlight of my trip!! Thanks so much!;5
Very good diving services and location (close to the dives sites) It s a nice little village with beautiful housing buildings Relaxing area are comfortable  Thanks to the staff to have made my stay so enjoyable;5
Nicely located if you enjoy nature and diving. The food is very good at the grill beach restaurant (lunch and snacks), ok at the main buffet but à la carte restaurants are disappointing. There is a nice variety of drinks and some bar tender are well trained. The rooms are comfortable with enough space but a bigger dresser could be useful. The pool is nice and big enough with a bar. The activities are great: volleyball, tennis, archery... But the pool table could be better located and leveled. The lobby is a nice place to hang out. There is a theater for special performance. The sound system could be better quality though (speakers) because it's sometimes too loud. The spa is very expensive. I recommend getting massage somewhere else.;4
Love the water stations. Should put one right by the pool. Friendly staff, great drinks. The food was good and dessert was the best I’ve had at an all inclusive. The kids had a BLAST at the Kids camp and wanted to go back every day. Overall great experience;5
Food quality needed improvement, bartenders needed more training - you would order the same drink from 3 or 4 different bartenders and get 3 or 4 different drinks. Quite a few guests got ill this trip.;4
Manolo does an excellent job of leading bilingual classes. I attended 4 classes throughout my stay, and every one offered something a little bit different. As an avid practitioner, I was thrilled to see yoga offered as an activity at the resort, and even more thrilled to get to experience these great classes in such a beautiful setting.;5
We traveled with 8 of us, 2 being young kids and there were plenty of fun activities for all the ages. The food was all delicious and the staff very friendly. Our kids absolutely loved the kids Star Camp and Monserrat and Rosa are their new favorite people. They did kite flying and puzzle making and treasure hunting. So many fun activities.;5
We have been coming here for years and while this isn’t a fancy high end resort, it is comfortable and feels like home here.  Unfortunately, last night we learned they have started  a very questionable method of making money involving their restaurants.  Two of the three a la carte restaurants are very small, so it can be a challenge to get a reservation.  The smallest of the three, the oriental themed one, does not take reservations.  We tried reserving a table on the app earlier in the day, but there was nothing available - at all in any restaurant.  While waiting to see if a table for 6 became available at the oriental, my husband went next door to the Mexican restaurant to see if there was an available table anyway (you never know).  It was after 7pm and he said the place;4
I simply love this location. It is intimate and low key, I enjoy the Prestige option where I have full access to a private club area with great service. The food is always great, the resort is tucked away in relatively unspoiled wilderness and having a Dressel dive shop right on the property adjacent to one of the world's best reefs is a bonus for me. The layout of the resort is also great in that most of the activities are close together and near the beech.;5
Excellent resort! Friendly, accommodating staff.  Beautiful grounds . Loved all of the wildlife. Snorkeling right off the pier was awesome!  Crystal clear water with tons of fish, Sting Ray, star fish, octopus right off the pier! Relax on the beach or party at the pool! Can’t say enough about what a great experience we had! We could have sat for hours in the lobby with Pepe the parrot!! Can’t wait to come back!!;5
My husband and I went to celebrate my 40th birthday. Everything was excellent, our room, the food, the activities at the resort, the beautiful landscaping, and all of the people who work there were so nice and hospitable. We had a great time doing Zumba with Mano.;5
2nd stay at Iberostar Cozumel. Love the accommodations, food, beach - very relaxing family environment.  Scuba and snorkel availability is a huge us for our family.  Definitely recommend this Iberostar location.;4
I chose this resort specifically because the dive shop was located here. Totally worth every penny!!!  The staff of the resort and Dressel Divers was top notch! My only negative is a personal choice. I wouldn’t have preferred bottle beer vs cans in my fridge. That’s it!  That’s my “negative”.  I am already planning my return trip and hope to make a yearly visit!!!;5
Just returned from a great 1 week stay.    We are return guests - as we really enjoy the nature, animals, laid-back feel, and the rooms situated in small huts.   The walk to dinner in the evening is beautiful.   The landscaping / flowers are wonderful.   Resort is a must for those that enjoy beautiful walks and view the winding walkways as an adventure.     If you prefer high rise with minimal walking - not for you.   If you prefer room service in your room over mingling in the lobby - not for you.  Housekeeping for the rooms is excellent - very clean.     Loved the new addition of the room key embedded in wrist band.    No more searching for room key.    We ate at the Asian, Mexican, Smokehouse (twice) and buffet.   Thought the food was excellent at each of the four.    We ate;5
Another wonderful stay for our family at Iberostar Cozumel. We keep coming back every year for the world class scuba diving and more. Nazareno, Milly, Rodrigo, Diego, Maria and everyone else at Dressel Divers are professional and so fun to dive with. The diving sites are so conveniently located within 10 minutes boat ride that I was able to do three dives per day and still have time to eat and relax. Montse, Rosa and Ismael entertained our two kids ages 5 and 8 at the kids club every day for 5-6 hours. They did such an amazing job that my children keep asking to come back to Cozumel soon. The food at the buffet is delicious, fresh with plenty of choice. We tried Mexican and Steakhouse  restaurants for variety and were satisfied. The buffet for the New Year Eve was top notch with;5
Iberostar was very nice and the food and beach was great. Gabriela and Danielle were very kind to us and invited us to many activities by the pool. Overall I would recommend it to somebody else and definitely want to come back;5
We have stayed here 3 times now. Love the Smaller buildings/huts instead of a large multistory building for the rooms. The staff are all nice and accomaditing. We had great experience with Gabriella and Julien of the Star team during some of the activities. We used the onsite dive shop, Dressel, and have had great experiences each time. The dive sites are just minutes from the pier. Would highly recommend this place.;5
This vacation has been awesome the staff is great especially the entertainment team we love Danielle and Fabian!! We highly recommend this trip to anyone thinking about it!! The drinks and vibes and food are the best here!!;5
"This is our second stay at Iberostar Cozumel in the last 8 months and there will be many more.  The staff is so friendly and accommodating at every level, reception, maintenance, activities, house keeping, servers and kitchen.  Specifically, my wife has Celiac disease (Severe Gluten Allergy) and the staff went above and beyond to accomadate her at any of the 5 restaurants on the property and also the many bars.  A big shout out to; Fidel, Yexmi, Javier and Manuel!  The restaurants have buffet style for many of their incredible meals, but with arrangements made at check in there was always an attentive Kitchen Host (Yexmi) or the Matradee Extrodanaire (Fidel) greeting us and offering so many Celiac Friendly appetizers, entrees and deserts for my wife.  She is not a big foody and";5
My wife & I have stayed at this great resort several times before but this year we brought the entire familia with us. We had a great 10 day stay! The staff, waiters, performers and activities people here are always first rate and the facility and accommodations are first rate as well. The nice folks at the front desk are always very informative and helpful - this year Isabelle went above and beyond to help us out. Fabio was perhaps the most helpful and fun activities person we dealt with this year but they are all great! I would highly recommend this resort for any sort of getaway. We will be back as soon as we can.;5
Vacation was amazing. Just wish they didn’t sell day passes to the cruise ships.  They took all our seats by the pool and beach. The restaurants, food, drinks and everything else was absolutely amazing.;5
This place was great for a relaxing resort. I loved everything about it, including the fun cabanas/rooms with comfy beds. The pool was large and most of the time you could find chairs. It is not a party resort, not as much with regards to entertainment.  They had some pool activities but they didn't hype them up and there was no music at the pool that had a swim up bar.  A little weird. There were shows at night that were pretty good and a nice area to view them.  By far, in all the 12+ resorts we've stayed in Mexico, it had the best food.  Marvelous food!!!  Good seafood, best desserts, just super yummy.  I liked the idea of the water areas that also included ice.  And of course flamingos and talking parrots make a fun experience.  Lovely beach with shade and lots of wait staff;5
I reviewed this hotel 8 years ago when we first took our 3 year old here.  She is now 11 and we returned to the hotel with friends in tow based on our previous experience.  The Iberostar did not disappoint!!  If anything this hotel has gotten better!!  The staff is friendly, hotel is amazing.  We love the grounds and all the effort the hotel goes into making the hotel picturesque.  The animals at the hotel are great for kids and we will neve forget Pepe (the green parrot we fell in love with),and Sylvester and Halloween the cats.    One very important area of improvement was the effort made to be eco friendly.  We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED their recyclable glass bottles and refill stations to use for drinking water versus plastic bottles.  AWESOME!!    I have to say the greatest;5
Amazing service and staff! The food was incredible and we loved every minute of being here at the resort. Daniele was awesome! We hope to come back here some time in the future! Couldn’t recommend it enough!;5
"Let me start by saying, we really enjoyed our stay at this resort.  There was only one major complaint and that was the beds. They were absolutely terrible. To be fair, they did replace the mattresses (with other previously used mattresses) to try to fix the problem, but the replacements  were only slightly better. We just toughed it out and took Advil for our backaches each morning. Honestly, everything else facilities, grounds, pool, beach, etc. ranks at 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion. However, the staff gets a 5 out of 5 stars. Very friendly and seemed to genuinely care about your satisfaction. Honestly, they are much better than the staff at most places I have stayed.  The best way I can describe the stay at this resort is it is like going to ""Summer Camp"".  If you go in";4
We spent a week at the Iberostar Cozumel on a stay and dive package. We were able to enjoy 8 dives on-site over 7 days, and on one day we did an excursion to the mainland to dive the Cenotes. The resort rooms are simple but nice, most important was that the bedding was comfortable and the space was clean. The food at the buffet did not disappoint -- there was always a wide range of foods available, though the variety didn't change that much over the course of the week. The 'a la carte' restaurants were just okay - the Mexican (probably not surprisingly) was definitely the best. I can't really speak for the other activities as we largely just did the diving, though we did take out the catamarans, which was fun, and we tried out the archery range and a few of the evening;4
It is an amazing place for divers and super convenient if you want to dive every day. Super nice staff. Environmentally friendly, no plastic facility. On the doom side, the room smells musty. Food is very good.;4
Very good location to relax and enjoy the beach , snorkeling , diving. It is not so crowded resort and easy to access buffet and bar. Restaurants are limited seating so it will be available basis. Diving club is on the property easy to book and access. The dock is on the property to go diving;4
Good stay overall but when it rains need to have other options for guest like hot tubs or other indoor activities. Much of the indoor building has thatched roofs that were not updated properly causing major flooding in the main lobby and theatre. I witnessed 5 people fall hard on the floor including elderly. This is dangerous. Staff needs to be trained to help mitigate dangerous areas and also roofs and buildings need to be updated.;3
Accommodations were lovely, entertainment as well, I do wish the bars stayed open later every night and the beach had a lot more chairs for the people at the hotel but I believe there was a cruise ship that docked and people were hanging out on the beach. Other than that we had a great time;4
Overall, I sincerely enjoyed my stay at Iberostar, we felt 100% safe, enjoyed the clean room, and I want to compliment the lady who was in charge of cleaning our room, during our stay there, her name I believe, was Lucero, that lady, works hard, very pleasant, professional, and a solid positive representation of the overall pleasant culture, there. because of this experience, my family has designated, Iberostar, as our new my go to spot, in Cozumel. 100%, Thank You.;5
This is a terrific resort where travellers can just “hang out”.   There were a lot of family groups that booked a stay. The buffet meals were good, grounds cleaned, air con good.  Internet was generally fast.  Their mixed drinks were good and they were quick to adjust them when asked (more Tequila, for instance). I’m I found the beds and pillows to be  V Good.   The pool is fine (fun for kids, too).    I did about 10 dives. The dive masters and crew were excellent and extremely attentive to ones needs.  I had my own dive gear,  but the gear from Dressel Divers is good.  The dive sites are good - not the “best ever “ as some over eager folks profess.  But the swim throughs are worth repeating.  Water temp was 83° F.   In all, we plan to return.;5
"I have traveled extensively and I must say this is the best resort I have stayed in.  The staff was amazing; very accommodating and attentive, the food was absolutely outstanding,  amazing variety and selection. I have a food allergy and the staff was very diligent about making sure of what I could eat and what I needed to avoid. The accommodations were perfect. The grounds and the beach as well as the rooms were  Clean comfortable and beautiful. I would love to make this a yearly. The entertainment was amazing as well. You really don't need to leave the resort everything is right there. I'm ready to go back!";5
Amazing Getaway!!!! After a 5 day stay at Iberostar Cozumel. We loved everything about it: the service, the food, the amenities, the location. I could not have been more pleased. The service was spot on, my special thanks to Anargely for her super excelence service, Angel at the lunch restaurant wonderful service, the grounds were just as delightful... I could not have felt more comfortable, installation, rooms super cleans. The Entertainment Team made happiness to our nights, Thanks Daniela Bonita. The food was phenomenal, the drinks were as flowing as I wanted them to be, the staff was more than accommodating... I can't even list any imperfections because if I had any, they were so minuscule and rectified by the staff immediately. What a wondrous and marvelous few days of my;5
Check in was great, we got this wrist band for your room so its always with you. Room was always cool and had a great shower. Plenty of towels, and a very close place to get filtered water for your room.  Everything was walking distance pool, food, entertainment, and of course the beach. They kept everyone well fed as the place offered a great variety of food to choose from. I cant wait to go back again since everyone was so nice there.;5
This is our third Christmas at Iberostar Cozumel and they have really made great improvements this year! The entertainment staff is AMAZING!! Gabriela, Julian, Fabian are the absolute best! The bar and wait staff are the very best. Even with crappy weather this year they have made our stay perfect!!!;5
Julian and the entertainment team were great!!! I got some great dance lessons from Julian and had lots of fun. I met many great people and would highly recommend going to Iberostar. It is a fabulous place for all!;5
The Iberostar Cozumel is a terrific resort for families, couples, and solo travelers to escape to. The resort layout is pretty cool. It’s clean,  quality service oriented, and concerned about you enjoying yourself.    Probably the best part is that all staff seem to be genuinely kind.  The pool is a delight for kids, the diving good, food very fresh, beds good….. like I said, a place to really “vacation”. After many years living in SE Asia, being in Cozumel is a wonderful addition to “places we love to hang out and get some diving in”.;5
This is my 2nd time to Iberostar Cozumel and it didn't disappoint! The rooms were clean (except for small ants that would come out if anything sweet was left out), the beds super comfortable, the landscape was extremely beautiful, and the entertainment throughout the day and evenings were so much fun and awesome! The wait staff was always smiling and ready to get whatever you needed, sometimes even bringing drinks when you were running low, without being asked. The activities are super fun and you have a wide range to do. This year, I scaled back from doing everything as I wanted to just relax at some times and get a good tan in the pool. You have that choice! The shows at night are superb with the best singers I have every heard. Thanks for entertaining me with your awesome;5
Excellent instruction, wonderful vibe. Manuel offers yoga and Pilates with a beach view daily at 8:30. There’s also beach yoga in the late afternoon. The morning classes are a perfect way to start your day! The food and entertainment were also highlights, truly something for everyone;5
Great beach volleyball and food! Good place to escape the cold in winter. Got to meet a lot of nice people! Love the workers, Daniela and Fabian! The sushi at the Oriental restaurant was amazing! They have great desserts.;5
Everything was amazing! Adai, Israel, and Venus at the star prestige club were amazing! Our servers Cristobol and Roger were fantastic. Amazing service and friendly faces. We really enjoyed our time at the Iberostar. 10/10 recommend!;5
Rosa, Monse, Julian and Ismael from kids club ate awesome and they have kept my daughter entertained throughout tour trip. Highly recommended  Highly recommend Ibestor as its a great vacation paradise for families;5
Loved everything about this property. Nestled in a tropical setting south end of the island away from the crowds and cruise ships. Very environmentally conscious. Beautiful snorkeling right off the beach. Rooms are tastefully decorated adequate space for all your things . All the Staff is very friendly , service is great. Loved the Mexican restaurant.;5
We have been coming here for many years. It has changed so much and not for the better. They are very short staffed now. Food choices are not so good. Cindy and Wilber are our favorite servers. The star friends don’t let you know when the games are. And Gabriella was the worst. She would not let anyone play the beach volleyball because they were full with staff and the ship cruise staff. She was very rude about not letting paying guests play. The shows are not as good. We love the rooms and the hammocks on the porch.;3
Morning yoga with Manolo was the best way to start the day. i’ve never felt as relaxed as I did at the end. He does such a great job explaining the poses and leading the breathing rhythm. Definitely going to try his other classes while we’re here!;5
Iberostar, Cozumel is awesome. The grounds are filled with peacocks and flamingos! The beauty of the Mayan Rivera is on full display. Zuri, at the concierge desk can help you with almost anything! Enjoy!;5
Overall this resort was beautiful and charming. The basic bungalows were clean, cool and had a nice deck on each with chairs and a hammock. Our room had some items not working (lighted mirror, clock, usb outlets) and they tried, but could only fix the clock. Not a big deal in our mind, but it would be nice if everything was working.  The temperature is set at around 22 Celsius degrees and to change it you must contact the front desk but it felt great and we never had to do that. The air does run the entire time when we’re not in the room, which seems very inefficient in my mind.  The rooms lack a coffee maker. I had to walk quite a ways to get my morning cup, but at least I got my steps in doing that! They do not have bottled water and use glass containers. You can refill those;4
Me and my husband came here on our honeymoon and we had the most amazing time. Everything was so wonderful and everybody was so incredibly kind. Bianca at reception is so nice and helpful. Leonel is the best bartender here! We went snorkeling with Paola and she was great! Yexmi the kitchen manager was so nice she sent us chocolate strawberries because it was our honeymoon. The food was pretty good but I wish there was more Mexican food. On Wednesday nights the buffet is more international and the only Mexican food they have is chips and salsa  It’s more of an older crowd here it’s not technically a super “romantic” destination since it’s a lot of families as well but that was fine with us because we’re not huge partiers we preferred it this way. we were here to go on adventures;5
Manolo’s classes were the highlight of our trip! I took Zumba, sunset yoga, and pilates classes with him during our family trip and really enjoyed them. I was even able to rope my sisters and father into a few classes because I raved about them so much. This is perhaps the first trip where I am leaving in better shape then when I arrived :);5
Overall it was okay but somethings could be improved like more staff (bars and servers) and quicker service in refilling food trays in the buffet. Food was good and our AC was freezing, nice. Rooms were clean. Never heard of any complaints about the rooms like what some people say. Mattress could be softer for sure. They really bothered my back.;4
This was our first trip to Cozumel but will definitely not be the last.  We had a wonderful time.  The people and accommodations at Iberostar were great.  I highly recommend going if you have never been.;5
Stayed here many times. Seems a bit under staffed in the restaurants compared to years past but still ok. Dive shop is always great and extremely convenient. Make sure to say ‘hi’ to Leo at the pool bar.;4
Diving at Iberostar with Flo Efinger has been one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had with diving. Being a divemaster myself it I am always a bit critical of other divemasters. But Flo was amazing! Flo above all else makes sure everyone is comfortable, safe and has an amazing dive. It was my fathers first time in the ocean and watching Flo work with him to get him comfortable was something else and it made the experience for both of us much more enjoyable knowing I didn't have to worry about my father. The Divemaster can make or break a dive trip and Flo definitely made this trip incredible! Anyone coming here should seriously consider diving with Flo if they can. I am so excited to be coming back here with many more people of july of 2023. This is an excelent resort;5
I am here now and they have Christmas lights up on the walking bridge and the lobby. However, they aren't on or working. The bridge is so dark it is hard to navigate. Get some lights working please. Love it other than that.;4
We travelled as a family booking 3 separate rooms.  In our opinion, the food and service were excellent. Entertainment was also very good with a special shout-out to Daniella, who was amazing. Our villa was on the second floor, which I do not recommend if you are not accustomed to stairs—they got wet and slippery most mornings or whenever it rained. I also found  the ocean access rocky and dangerous to enter— I could not walk in holding my infant grandson because of fear of falling. There are steps off the adjacent dock but they are also slippery and rickety. We had massages on site which were amazing $150USD each plus tip. Sunset yoga and morning Pilates are offered but the older Mexican gentleman conducting these classes seemed quite pompous and was not the best instructor (my;4
I went with a group for a dive vacation.  This was perfect for this.  Great integration with Dressel Divers, and the hotel was very accommodating to our group.  The grounds are simply beautiful. The landscaping was amazing - beautiful and well maintained.  I loved that they seemed to be very eco-conscious.  There were no plastic water bottles - instead they provided water bottles in the room and several water fill stations throughout the property.    The food was plentiful.  I wish that the food and drinks were a bit bitter.  It was all plentiful and varied, but didn't match the quality of the grounds and the service.;4
Our family had an amazing time. The staff is outstanding, especially Daniella and the swim up bar staff Manuel and Adrian. They all went out of there way to make it a great experience all week. Thank you for your hard work and dedication;5
Stayed here in December for a friends wedding and we had so much fun! They worked so hard to make sure we had a great time! Ismael and Daniela were awesome. Great drinks and lots of food options! We also loved that they have direct beach access and lots of beach space and it’s right by a dock for any tours you may want to take. Would stay here again!;5
"Just stayed for a week with my family and it was fantastic!!! Check in was easy, service was always fantastic, food was great; buffet was lovely with lots of options, a la carte restaurants were decent. The resort grounds were absolutely beautiful, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the pool/beach area was beautiful. Staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodateing, but Daniella and Adrian were 2 of the best! Daniella was so awesome, always checking in with us to ensure we were having fun and playing the games at the pool, she was a part of the family for the week and we will miss her dearly ❤️ Overall, great stay and I would recommend this resort to anyone!!!";5
Resort is small. Easy to get around.  Beautiful grounds, very forestry.  Many ferrel animals on grounds.  Food was superb.  Rooms efficient, could use updating.  Employees friendly and helpful.  Beach is gorgeous but rocky in water.  We would definitely go back.;5
We had a great time with family enjoying the resort over Thanksgiving week.  The staff is friendly and takes pride in the property and it show to their guests.  The food was good and the rooms were clean.  It is a great location to relax and enjoy the beautiful island of Cozumel and dive on their wonderful reef.;5
An exceptional international experience. Friendly people from all over the globe to meet and share. Beach was peaceful, sandy and the water warm and calm.  Food was amazing as my waistline grew quite a bit. The Thanksgiving buffet was phenomenal. The Turkey moist and delicious and the mashed potatoes were soooo good! They had a hard time keeping that bowl full.  So many delicious foods to choose from every day and the dessert selection was over the top! I’m sure I ate more desserts in one day than I do in a month at home.  The grounds and rooms were clean and comfortable, all the staff was polite and helpful. And Dressel Divers on site did not disappoint. What a great place to spend Thanksgiving week!;5
Manilow’s morning yoga class was phenomenal! He was so kind and encouraging to all of the students. I had a nice workout and was left with a peaceful state of mind. I highly recommend this wonderful service. What a great way to start the day!!!;5
Thank you Iberostar, Cozumel for the most amazing vacation! We went to dive with Dressel Divers but had a wonderful stay at the hotel! Everything was perfecto from our beautiful rooms, great service, delicious food and charming grounds. A very special thank you to Fabian at LA PAGODA and the waiters. This was our favorite restaurant and Fabian really went out of his way to make my daughters birthday extremely special. They brought in a special appetizer and made sure every part of dinner was extra perfect. We also fell in love with our morning waiter Carlos who remembered us and saved our favorite table for 7 every morning. Although we came for the wildlife underwater, the nature and animals at the resort above the sea were so fun to watch. We all loved the flamingos, cats,;5
Gabriela and Montserrat are amazing with my kids best employees at Iberostar!! Five stars can’t wait to come back the food is amazing the volleyball was outstanding and the overall customer service experience was the best I’ve had in Cozumel;5
9 of us came down to watch my son complete the Ironman.  We have stayed here several times. We feel the food is the best on the island. The staff were so friendly. The rooms and the resort were super clean. The staff always accommodated the large group of us. Couldn’t have asked for a better vacation.;5
We went (self and two teens) to Iberostar over Thanksgiving week. Overall, very positive experience! The food and amenities were great! We dove with the local dive shop, Dressel Divers. Diving was spectacular!   The staff were fabulous from the bellhops to bartenders to cleaning crew. Very professional. We especially loved Alejandra - she was on the entertainment crew … we thought she WAS the entertainment crew. So engaged and fun with the guests !!   The only downside was that the hotel had guests from cruise ships on two of the days we stayed. This was really an interruption. I’m sure they bring in some good revenue from the daily visits, but this is a big drawback as a guest. Unfortunate.;5
GABRIELA AND MONTSERRAT are amazing! Very friendly! Very helpful! Lots of fun! The shows are amazing! The food is amazing! All the staff, waiters, house keeping, grounds keepers are all very friendly and helpful! We will definitely be back!;5
I like the food the place looks great and the peoples is really nice and for that reason I enjoyed to be here. Ismael, Fabian, Rosa, Gabby, and Danny all enjoy spending time with others and are great to be around.;5
My wife and I have been diving in Cozumel for 12 years or so. After year one, we were hooked (easy direct flight – leave home at 6:00 a.m., in the water at 1:00 p.m. – and an unbeatable bang for your buck once you jump off the boat).  We quickly began heading down 4, 5 and even 6 times a year, often for two weeks at a time. We always stayed at Iberostar. Thus far, have been there (Iberostar Cozumel only, so that’s not counting their other properties) somewhere between 56 and 58 times. We’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly over the years, but were always treated fairly.  As we became even better repeat customers – and brought them new clients (friends, families and *dive groups*) – we were treated a bit more “preferentially”. Ironically, this only entailed getting a room;2
Beautiful property, great diving and dive operator, service outstanding and food a solid 3 star.  5 years ago, we stayed at another inclusive near Iberostar and the food was atrocious.  The food here is decent with a great choice of fresh salads and decent fresh fish.  Good breakfasts with lots of choice of cereals, baked goods fruit, juices and two egg stations where you can get eggs to order quickly.  Lunch buffet has very good salads and usually the fish dishes are good and lots of choice.  Dinners at the buffet were fine, again with lots of choice.  Fish dishes good, as were chicken and pork dishes.  Steaks a little tough but tasty.    Every staff member on the property is friendly and accommodating.  Had a bulb out on our balcony and fixed within 10 minutes.  Pickup of;5
I was just stung in the leg by a scorpion while sleeping. It was under the covers in my bed. This is not the best way to wake up. The hotel staff was not too concerned and compared it to a bee sting. I’ve been stung by bees before. This is worse. Probably won’t be sleeping very well for the rest of the night.;1
It was our first time at the Iberostar Cozumel. Our hotel experience was great overall.   The Star Camp and its staff were fantastic!  Rosa and Monse took such care of our son that he preferred to be at the camp than having fun with us at the beach or even at the excursions. Thanks to both of them for being so friendly, fun and caring. We will miss you!;5
really good food, pool, good entertainment team and volleyball is fun. ismael, fabian, daniela are amazing. we come here every year and it’s our tenth time really good service. the flamingos are really pretty, lots of nature.;5
We had an amazing trip at Iberostar Cozumel. Our favorite part was the amazing activities with Daniella, Alejandra, and Fabian! They made out trip so memorable and fun! We loved playing beach volleyball, aqua zumba, and more! Thank you 🥰;5
Unbelievable resort and dive facilities. Flo was our dive master through our stay and was the most knowledgeable, caring, fun leader we've had at the resort. He was always spotting seemingly imperceptible wildlife and was always accommodating. Cannot recommend highly enough. Great dude! Great resort!;5
We had a relaxing stay here and the bungalows were a new experience for us.  Food was decent and the pool fine, could use more activities during the day. I didn’t like going outside to fill up a water bottle when I needed a morning drink and the room fridge didn’t work. Beach bar was neat and we enjoyed our stay overall.;3
It was fun. I met a bunch of new people who were nice and funny. The food was good and there were a bunch of new things. It was hot which was nice. I did some activities with Daniela and Fabian.   w.      w e;5
The food is good, very fresh. Pool is calm and relaxing, and staff are attentive. Lots of games and activities played with the staff, keeps everyone entertained. The pool is located by the main necessities, such as the lunch buffet and a bar for drinks. The staff Daniela and Fabian are entertaining and help with the games and activities;5
i really liked fabian and daniela and i really enjoyed playing beach soccer and water volleyball with them. the staff were really friendly and really accommodating, and the food was really good, as there was lots of variety.;5
Beautiful and quiet resort. Good food and service. If you are looking for a place to party, look somewhere else! But if you are looking for a place to relax or a base for scuba diving, then this place is for you!;5
Food in the buffet was good. Specialty restaurants fair. They have a good entertainment staff, but they need to download some classic rock and salsa music videos and offer dance lessons in the Mexican Restaurant several nights a week. Too much of the evening entertainment is just sitting around listening to average singing talent. GREAT scuba location, 5 minutes from the best reefs in the western hemisphere.;5
The bracelet making activity on the beach that Rosa, Dani, and Monse hosted was awesome! I got to keep a very colorful custom bracelet that I made as a souvenir from my trip to beautiful Cozumel! 10/10!;5
Rosa, Mon, Daniella, they were excellent with the kids activities in making bracelets extremely friendly and helpful. They were such beautiful ladies it was a pleasure meeting them, when we come back I hope to see them!;5
Only 1 kind of beer, no diet pop in rooms only on fountain in bar. It’s honest food, like the oriental the best.  Coffee sucked. Needed just regular coffee.  They gave you a towel to borrow, but you had to rent a snorkel 😳.  Wish they had a TV in lobby that we all could have watched .  But over all not bad for what we paid.;4
Very nice beach, pools and setting. Good food, activities, entertainment and snorkeling. Danny = amazing entertainer. Roger = awesome waiter. Arturo = fun bartender. Great time, vegetarian/vegan options too. Drinks need more alcohol. Friendly staff.  Very clean, nice property.;5
The Iberostar is absolutely amazing ! The staff are soo wonderful and friendly and helpful We loved them all! Alejandro she was entertainment and she was the sweet girl in the world ! Such a clean place;5
Disappointed that the steak restaurant had changed. Felt that the amount of food served for six of us was not up to other tables around us with two or four people. Mentioned to reception and told that a manager would contact me. No contact, disappointed;4
Restaurants were not air conditioned.  Food was not very good. Entertainment was a joke. Rooms were marginal.  The bar only carried one beer choice.  Drinks were not very strong. The staff was very kind.;2
We loved everything about this property! The food, location, facilities, everything! The jungle setting of the rooms was phenomenal and so much wildlife roaming the grounds. Sustainability is so important to us and one of the reasons we selected this property. Not one piece of single use plastic in sight! (Altho make sure to bring your own cup and water bottle…) The entertainment was fantastic! We aren’t big foodies but liked all of the food and restaurants we tried. Cozumel is such a beautiful, laid back destination. We can’t wait to bring our entire family back! And we will stay here again when we do!;5
Not being able to flush toilet paper is a negative. Having to leave your room to get your own water from a central water location isnt great either. Having beaches that are full of rocks detracts from the beach since you cant really go in the ocean. The staff is friendly,  the food is decent. But I wouldn't say anything special, as far as the food. We tried the Mexican and steakhouse restraunt and the buffet. We are more of night life people so when on two or three occasions on a four night stay the bar ran out of the type of alcohol we drink that kinda sucked. The grounds were somewhat hard to navigate as every path wound around and looked the same. Either more signage or some kind of color system for the paths would help;3
Prestige lounge Ani Lopez is the best. Very friendly, out going and makes you feel special. Never have an empty glass she is really on top of everything. We need more people like Ani. Wish there was more music at the pool. Food is good my favorite was the Asian restaurant.;4
Was lucky enough to meet Ana Lopez in the Star Prestige lounge who made our trip extra special. She went over and beyond to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. We’ve been to this resort twice and it keeps getting better!! Thank you Ana for your hospitality !! Hope to go back soon;5
Resort was awesome. The privilege area is very relaxing. The animals in resort are great to be around. Ani Lopez in the bar at the privilege bar is very sweet and helpful. She makes the experience great. Highly recommend a trip to Iberostar Cozumel.;5
Stayed at Iberostar Cozumel for scuba diving. The dive center is right there and runs like a well oiled machine. All the dive masters and staff were super professional. Spent some time at the gym with Manolo, the fitness instructor. He helped me with my workouts. We also did Aquafun and beach volleyball with Alejandra and Daniela from entertainment team. They were all amazing.;5
The resort looks like a tropical village. Very eco-friendly and lots of wildlife. Many Ironman participants stayed at the resort while we were there. Loved the sunrise yoga with Manolo. He is very knowledgeable and makes sure everyone has a great experience.;5
Diving was fantastic.  Really enjoyed Manolo’s sunset yoga on the beach - it was a really good intermediate level and he pushed you if he could tell you could do more.  Hard to balance on one leg in the sand, though!;5
Great resort with plenty of options for food and drinks.  The main things to do are scuba and other water sports.  There is a decent amount of wildlife to take in as well.  Great place to stay if you are going to scuba.  The beach is clean and the water is clear.  Plenty of wildlife under the dock as well.;4
We stayed at the Iberostar Cozumel during a recent dive trip. The rooms were nice. The service and staff were friendly. The resort was clean. The food was good, and there was always an enormous variety of options. Really my only complaint is that the check-in and check-out processes were painfully slow. We had checked in online, hoping to save time upon our arrival and we ended up re-scanning our passports and re-answering the same battery of questions we had just answered during the online checkin process. So, I'm guessing the online checkin is just a work in progress, and not a functioning system. Checkout was equally slow.;4
Ismael and Alejandra were the BEST!  Lots of activities for the 5 of us siblings/in-laws.  Good food, good drink, nice people, friendly staff and MORE!   Really enjoyed the introduction to scuba in the pool!  Planning to return for certification soon!  Thank you to everyone at Iberostar!;5
I purchased a day pass for $70 while my cruise ship was docked. I took a taxi to the resort which was $25. My food and drinks at the resort were included and so delicious!!  I used the pool, beach, was able to get a same day spa appt as well. The staff was very friendly and the grounds were immaculate!!!;5
Beautiful property, just bad bugs. The place needs to be treated for mosquitos because they will eat you alive. Buy bug spray because bug spray there is $30. Nice resort but just the bugs and wildlife.;4
My favorite daily experience were the poolside activities and especially enjoyed Daniela and Fabian. They are energetic, friendly, full of energy, great suggestions for  other entertainment here welcoming, accommodating, helpful and always with a smile.;5
Excellent resort. Food and service excellent. Rooms gorgeous. Gabriela is very friendly and a very good archery teacher!! In the evening there is live entertainment which excellent. All in all, never a dull moment!!;5
THE BEST EXPERIENCE! Highly recommend. great activities with Daniela, Fabian and Alejandra. Great restaurants! Great pool and amazing ocean view! Pool activities were the best! amazing bars and drinks! The best customer service!!;5
This is one of the loveliest resorts I have ever stayed at. The separate buildings set in more of a garden like atmosphere was very pleasant to walk through. Seeing the birds in the lobby, the flamingoes, the coaties, and even the cats made for great entertainment! The food was delicious, and we loved both the Mexican restaurant and Smoke House for dinner. The pool was a great temperature for swimming, and the staff was wonderful. Our entertainment team, Alejandra, Fabian, Daniela, and Gabriela kept everyone smiling. They were great at getting people to join in on activities! Freddie made sure the pool bar was always fun, and he even created surprises for me when I couldn’t figure out what drink I wanted! Joshua did a great job in the Mexican restaurant. Rogelio the waiter never;5
Yoga & Pilates sessions directly at the beach were awesome, thanks to Manolo! Great start into the day, good trainer, perfect level also for beginners.  In general all Animateurs were really motivated and did a great job.;5
we had a great time with stay at the iberostar resort a smaller property so we didnt have to walk so much we enjoyed  all the games and activies there was good snorkeling under the pier nice sand beach the food was ok  not great the swim up bar and pool were great  and seeing the flamingos  on the way to breakfast in there pond was nice looked like they had a nice kids club to;4
I had the most lovely time in the activities, the people here has been excellent, so kind and friendly. Ismael, Rosa, Monse, Gabriela from entertainment staff. Angel from the buffet, he was awesome too.;5
Thank you for everything Entertainment Team at the Iberostar Cozumel has been fabulous! Especially Ismuel, Rosa, Dani, Mon, Gabi, Fabion ale and humberto   The food has been delicious.  Clean rooms.  The Dive Center is really cool!;5
Alejandra that is part of the activities is very fun!!! Just won another Iberostar hat 🧢 playing bingo!!! Super fun!! The resort is beautiful and I will come back every year with my husband!! Food is great and the views are amazing! The staff is beyond wonderful!! I love Iberostar Cozumel!!;5
We were moved from Allegro due to the fire and we were pleasantly surprised by our experience.  The grounds were well kept and even though there were some other reviews about mosquitos, they sprayed while we were there and issues were limited.   We are looking forward to our next trip in April.;4
"The grounds are beautifully maintained and the resort has a great layout. The rooms were clean and had a stocked minibar. Comfy beds. We and are friends both had some facilities issues with the rooms that were fixed right away. The staff was friendly and the drinks were good, especially at the lobby bar. This resort is focused on the scuba crowd. The snorkling around the dock was awesome. We really enjoyed the buffet, which was different each of the three days wew were there. This is not a ""sit your ass on the beach and get waited on"" type of place, which was fine with us. As mentioned in an earlier review, you must keep in mind the location. It is an isolated island, in mexico...that being said, the resort does very well in the service department. We did have a weird experince";5
The hotel is amazing. Animals all around. The food is not special. The quality of the drinks in the bars are just ok. Mostly the staff treats you with kindness. The beach has a lot of rocks so you will need special shoes, but it's amazing, its like a pool on the ocean.;3
My wife and I went for a SCUBA DIVE trip and were very pleased with Iberostar in Cozumel. The dive experience as well as the hotel/resortt experience were one of our favorite dive experiences! The dive shop at this resort was very well run and rooms/cottages were very charming.;5
The staff in the restaurant, bell bys, reception had an excellent attitude and treated my son with down syndrome. People with intellectual disabilities require to be treated with empathy and understand their special needs.;5
My Wife and I took 4 friends to Iberostar Cozumel for 8 days. This is the 14th time we have been. The food and service were wonderful as always. Covid apparently gave them the opportunity to add a few things to the grounds and freshen up the place. We made new Starfriends since it has been 3 years.  Alejandra, Fabian, Daniela and Gabriela all worked hard to make our experience a memorable and fun one. Dressel Divers provided a great dive experience. Thank you very much Maria, Oky and Flo. As usual we can’t wait to return.;5
Iberostar in Cozumel is a wonderful place to stay. There are many reasons we keep going back time after time. We have visited Iberostar nine times in the past 10 years.  We have made many friends over the years that we still stay in touch with at Iberostar. The employees at Iberostar our second to none. People like Alejandro that works as a concierge at the front desk. He will answer your every question and fulfill your every need while at the resort. The bartenders are excellent at every bar. The all-inclusiveness of Iberostar Cozumel is fantastic. Food is available whenever you are hungry. There are bars located all around the resort to for fill your alcohol need 24/7. *Star Friends like Gabby, keep you involved in the activities at the resort. The camaraderie experienced at;5
I had so much fun at Iberostar Cozumel. They had food for everyone, activities for young and old, salt water pool and an amazing beach and sunset view. I loved the bartender Freddy, he always knew what to make when I said “surprise me”. I also loved the entertainment team, who coordinated so many activities in the rain or shine. Alejandra and Gabriella especially made me feel super welcome and ensured we always had a good time. The shows at night were super fun and really entertaining, as well as daytime pool activities and super easy full bar access from everywhere. The waitstaff was incredible and they had so many food options. I definitely want to come back here!;5
Always have a great time when staying at Iberostar Cozumel. Rosa helped with dream catcher craft. Alejandra is amazing at coordinating activities even when it's rainy. Fabian us so nice and made sure we played all the games. Humberto was also great at getting activities together and keeping the crown engaged. And Anna was the best bartender and helped me decide on fun drinks!;5
Even in the rain the Star Friends made it an amazing vacation. Many thanks to Rosa, Alejandra, Humbert, Fabian and Daniela. Love them all! Weight staff is wonderful. Mariela is fantastic!  Ana is my favorite drink lady!;5
"The place is very, very nice; it certainly gives you your money’s worth. The property is well kept, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The food is good, the Mexican restaurant and the Steakhouse being the best ones, just remember to make a reservation at the main lobby. Drinks depend on the bartender, sometimes they were very good and sometimes just so. The pool is clean and there’s plenty of chairs to get sun sun. The entertainment team is great!!! These people work their butt off to make sure you are having a good time. Humberto, Alejandra, Daniela, Gabriela, Fabián are great and I loved talking to them. If you’re thinking about going to Cozumel, this is your place.";4
Everything was good!! Ice and water stations could be more plentiful.  Sometimes the hot food was cold. Maybe steamer trays would help . The waiters and waitress are very accommodating. Overall experience was great.;5
The hotel is beautiful with so much nature available to you to witness.  We loved the entire trip and it made time with our teenagers a memorable experience.  Thank you to Manolo for keeping us fit during our trip - beach yoga, pilates, zumba and the gym. Thank you to all the staff that fed us as the food was excellent. Thank you to Fabian, Alejandra, Gabriela for entertaining us through the day. Thank you to Isidro for making us coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening. Thank you to Orlando and other pool bartenders to make sure we stay hydrated.  We enjoyed our entire trip - food, entertainment, fitness, snorkeling and seeing baby sea turtles.  Thank you to the management for making this available to us.;5
Very nice property.  The rooms are very clean but on the small size but we don't spend much time in the room.  The best restaurant on the property is the Mexican.  Angel and his staff are very accommodating and attentive. The food at the smokehouse was good however, the service was horrible so I wouldn't suggest going there if you are hungry.;4
The most awesome staff ever. Easy to get around for those of us with physical challenges (they will pick you up and drop you off!!) Entertainment is good, pool activities are fun to watch and participate in, and the food is good.;5
The customer service was excellent and Rosa was especially nice and accommodating.  The food could use some work not a fan of buffets. I enjoyed the Japanese pig Ada restaurant the most. Relaxing quiet trip.;5
Most everything was good. We snorkeled the beach and saw starfish.  The sunsets we're beautiful. Lots of activities and they were on time. Some of the activities were new to us and fun.   Good variety of food, sometimes cold.  Best of all was their activity people. They were personable, active and fun. We enjoyed them the best. Especially ahjendria. I'll was a fine time. I also like how green the hotel is. .;5
The grounds are lovely and the staff is attentive and friendly. There are lots of fun activities. We especially like archery and riflery with Daniela, and sunset yoga with Manolo. Daniela is so much fun while leading her activities, and also great to have a lively conversation with. Manolo’s class is challenging, yet he encourages you to listen to your body, and work on breathing and body-mind connection. The shows we’ve seen so far are great, with talented, energetic and adorable singers and dancers.;5
Absolutely loved this spot. The grounds are beautiful, the food is good, and the staff is amazing. Alejandra, Fabian, and Daniella made the whole trip. Make sure to catch the shows at night. There are activities going on all day. I can’t wait to come back next year and bring my son. All of the children’s activities looked so fun.;5
Loved it all. Second time here. Gabriella was the best from entertainment staff, she was the best! Alexandia was great too! The waiter Elisandra from the beach. In general everyone has been awesome... Sad that we need to leave :(;5
alejandra, entertainment employee was excellent check with our group everyday.  She was just an all around wonderful person to be around.  Stephanie-towel check in employee, was very helpful and explained beach towel rules.  Amstar employee- El Salvador- help us book an excursion that we will never forget.  Best vacation ever!

The smokehouse restaurant was a great experience at the resort! The food was amazing, the service was absolutely wonderful! Justo, Fabian, and Vitaliano were the best . They work so hard to remember everything- your drink, preferences,  your name - every time! So friendly ,  such a great experience. Top notch! Five ÷ stars for there fellows!;5
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotels grounds are beautiful, and we enjoyed all the wildlife running around the premises. The dock is super convenient, even though we didn't dive with Dressel divers, the small convenience fee to have another dive outfit pick you up from the dock is worth every penny.  We enjoyed the food, the steakhouse and the Mexican restaurant were both very good, and neither my wife or I ever left a meal at the buffet unhappy. The hosts for the lobby games were always fun, and the entertainers on the main stage were always very good. We had only been to one other resort in Cozumel before Iberostar, but would choose Iberostar over the other resort for our next visit hands down every time. Cant wait to go back;5
Really good classes, lots of fun! Rosa and Gabriella were really friendly. Classes were regular and creative and relevant to wildlife preservation which was eye opening and interesting.   We really enjoyed our stay!;5
Manolo the instructor at the gym was amazing, very helpful and knowledgeable. Very friendly staff here at the Iberostar. Loved the staff for the pool activities. Made the day go by fast and exciting. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Wonderful service! Clean facilities. Lots of activities. Plenty of space. Food was good. There were plenty of chairs by the pool. Anything we needed help with there was staff available to assist us. Would definitely recommend! Rosa, Ismael and Daniella were fantastic!!;5
We stayed oct 11-17 2022. There were some great improvements like be able to breath! We were able to walk through the lobby and there was NO SMOKING!!! Hooray!! The buffet was generally good food. My only complaint  there was you had to ask for ice cream at dinner, it used to be out. My fiend stated she couldn't find guacamole all the time. All staff is great in the buffets.  Our room 8602 didn't have ac working very well. We didn't complain because it sorta worked, in the past rooms we stayed in got very cool. We had brought back up fans with us and that kept us ok during the night. House keepers do a great job and when we asked for more Coke instead of other drinks in the fridge, they happily complied.   Pool was alright. The reason for the 4 star is because there was a huge;4
I had an amazing time at the iberostar in Cozumel, Gabriela was an amazing employee, Francisco, Raymundo and Adrian were great bartenders, the entire service was spectacular. I will recommend the resort to all my friends.;5
Good activities, more volleyball and soccer during the day. Gabriella was great. Food was really good needed a few more times to reserve the dinner. A strawberry daiquiri machine would be great near the pool;5
Incredible:  Our first time at an Iberostar and we definitely want to return to this location. The property in lovely, clean and welcoming. Our room was very comfortable, and the food is incredible. The staff is beyond friendly. Concierge Zurisaday, helped us making dinner reservations. She was extremely helpful throughout out stay. We look forward to visiting Iberostar again...;5
For the place we like the pool the beach the restaurant and mainly the entertainment staff thank you Rosa Ismael gaby dani Fabian Alejandra and Humberto are wonderful so far so good  When we checked in Eduardo was amazing. Is very relaxing;5
Manolo is such a wonderful instructor. I have been to the gym every day. I remember him from previous visits here at Iberostar teaching water aerobics and always enjoyed his classes. Now that he’s in the gym he is very attentive to the needs of all the students needing training. He provides us with assistance on the equipment. He offers us towels and cleans the equipment for us if we need it. I recommend that everyone visit the gym at Iberostar and work out with Manolo.;5
We had the best time with our friends, mother (in-laws), and children. There’s something for everyone here. The food and drinks are excellent. There’s plenty of places to relax quietly. My kids loved all the animals. We all LOVED the entertainment staff so much. They really welcomed and included us in everything and made sure we had a great time. Daniella & Fabian were fabulous!;5
I think that all the Iberostar hotels are amazing and that we are very lucky to have  all this stuff and access to food and drinks. This is so fun and has everything to do. My favorite part is doing activities with Fabian and Daniela.;5
We are having a great vacation! We enjoy all the activities are so fun! Daniela is amazing! She is so friendly and helpful. The food has been delicious and we have had so much fun on this trip so far.;5
If like me you always read the negative reviews first, I hope you get a chance to read through to the end before you make a decision on whether to stay here or not. First impressions when we arrived here, a lovely spacious lobby, and yes it smelt a little damp…… but when the humidity is as high as it is, what else would you expect and trust me, your nose adjusts pretty quickly so by the time we got to breakfast the next morning, what smell? The grounds are spectacular, the beaches beautiful, yes rocky but if you’ve done your research you’ll know to bring water shoes. So much wildlife to see, in and out of the water. Our room was spacious and kept impeccably clean, bathroom stocked with amenities. The fridge was always topped up with fresh drinks. Food was plentiful and varied;5
Pool fabulous daniela diaz fantastic rosa was soo nice  The little shop is cute, people is so nic. AC need to be moree cooler, you can be better in food and friends. Its a beautiful hotel, diving is excellent.;5
Best trip experience ever very friendly staff and best place to dive and the staff that does games and shows were super nice and deserve a raise and the dive crew Mily and Rodrigo are the best dive masters hands down;5
This is our second visit at the resort and we have to say this is a great island get a way. There is lots to do at the resort (from watching all the unique animals, splashing in the pool or at the beach, walks on the beach, snorkeling by the dock: you see lots of unique fish, shows at night, BINGO and the lottery in the lobby and Star Camp for kids during the day). The food is fantastic and the staff is very attentive. This trip we had the couples massage and it was nice, breakfasts and lunches at the buffets and pool side cabana were great quick options for a bite to eat and the supper restaurants always had a nice selection.  IF you are a diver there is an on site dive facility and they pick you up right on the pier ocean side from the resort. First trip we took a snorkel trip;4
Rooms were comfortable and food was delicious. Buffet had lots of options and the majority were delicious  Few minor issues in the room, but the staff was quick to resolve  Gym/fitness center was well equipped, and Manolo was super helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. He made our vacation fitness fun and memorable;5
We decided to do the water aerobics, beach Zumba & beach yoga. Manolo was the instructor for these classes. He was fantastic! Cued great, gave great tips. He also was the attendant at the gym when I went one morning. Super helpful!;5
The rooms were nice and clean. There could be more variety at the buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I do not recommend ever taking the taxi off the resort. Stay on the resort. The service of the waiters could have been more prompt. Isidro is a great bartender. Gabriela is great at entertaining.;3
Great experience ! Everything in one place: great food, entertainment, diving and workout. Shout out to Manolo and his amazing sunset yoga lessons, as well as Pilates and zumba class! A week in paradise without gaining (too much) weight :);5
The food is cheap and l have suspicious that they put something to make you feel full rapidly, we spent 10 days at thee resort and my stomach just hurried every day after eat, l am not a big eater even though felt bloated also, the drinks are very very cheap alcohol, doesn’t tasty right as when you order at a regular restaurant. The room are good that’s it.;2
A very well laid out Resort, neat and clean rooms, the food was very good, great beach and wonderful view of the Caribbean Sea. The staff was very good in behavior and managing activities, particularly Daniela and Fabian were excellent in conducting events by the poolside and on the beach during day and in the lobby during evening. Because of the number of activities in the resort, we did not have to go out during the five days we stayed there.;5
"God staff, good food, friendly people.  Seventh time there and told dive shop to expect me back next year, so I liked it.  Caveats:  mentioned this in last review;  they need to provide those cheap plastic toilet brushes;  they have low flow/low level commodes, which is fine.  But in Mexico?  Touchy subject, but we are in Mexico!  I feel that is too much to ask of the staff to clean up after me on the sides of the toile bowl, but I have nothing to use except TP.  Asking fair amount of me too!  And you are not supposed to flush the paper!  They get one more chance and if no brushes next time, will let staff do the “dirty work”. And tip them extra. Another issue, the pool towels.  Whatever happened to the cards?  Contactless, i suppose.  I returned my towel early  the morning of";4
For about a year we had been planning a wedding ceremony at a resort in Cozumel.  Unfortunately this resort suffered a massive fire and eventually the wedding team confirmed that they would not be able to accommodate our wedding, meaning our wedding was cancelled! We were desperate at this point with 30 guest expecting  to attend a Cozumel wedding in just a few weeks!   We started contacting other venues in Cozumel but due to the late date, we were skeptical of finding our dream wedding location.  Once we contacted Victor with Iberostar corporate wedding department and explained our unfortunate situation, he promptly contacted Cozumel and confirmed that the date was available.   Next we had to confirm that our group of wedding guest would actually have a place to stay!  The;5
This resort was quaint and beutiful. I loved how we had access to the beach and an on-site dive shop - seperate from the hotel ( Dressel Divers). Staff was friendly. I really appreciated the access to faltered water throughout the site. The drinks were okay and food okay.;4
Everything was amazing!  I had done a lot of research for a vacation with my adult daughter and really happy that I found Iberostar. The vibe was really nice, being more low key than a lot of other places in Mexico. The staff was unbelievable!! Alejandra, Daniella, Gabriela, and Fabian ran amazing events! Definitely go see the musical shows at night, they are ridiculously good! Amber and Danny’s voices were incredible and the band on rock night certainly rocked!! The spa was great, very calm and the massage was very good. The buffet was good, with a wide selection and good taste. The a la carte nights were a really treat. My daughter and I were amazed with the manager Fabian. I have over 20 years of experience in restaurants and he was beyond impressive. Honestly, the staff;5
Great place to stay, eat, and play. Gabriela, Alejandra, and waiter Elisandra were fabulous! The diving and food were fantastic. Highly recommend to anyone looking for diving and an all inclusive resort.;5
We stayed at this all inclusive in Cozumel. The rooms were super clean and the staff were kind and respectful. Daniela, Alejandra, and Fabian were part of the entertainment crew they were absolutely wonderful and made the experience so fun. I highly recommend :);5
I had an awesome experience at this resort. Was treated very well by the staff and my room was kept very clean and well stocked. The activities were fun and a great way to make some new friends. Food was great and dinner was different each night which was nice. I will definitely be back!;5
The hotel was super nice, well-maintained and clean (thanks to all the gardeners), the food was delicious and there was plenty of choice.  Staff was always helpful and friendly.  The program, both on the beach and at the pool, was great with something for everyone, here again a big thank you to Gabriela (Gabi), Stephanie, Karen and Ismael, who do a great job.  We'll meet Again.;5
I like the food the beach the weather was really good the staff mainly the entertainment as Ismael Alejandra Gaby Fabian Karen Daniela and Stephanie thank you so much for everything because was a beautiful experience;5
The Iberostar has the best location, fun activities, and the staff is fun! They even remembered my birthday and brought a bottle of champagne to my room! The concierge booked us on a jerk tour! Highly recommend! The snorkeling tour took us to 4 reefs and they were awesome!;4
A beautiful hotel to relax, unwind, feel good and with pleasant entertainment. We have particularly good memories of Alejandra, who inspired us with her cheerful nature. In general, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.;5
room and people were great, food good, steak house awesome, wild animals fun to see. Mosquitoes everywhere, fun shows but not enough night life, hot tub only in spa and you get 1 visit per week, mosquitoes will keep me from going back;4
Check-in took too long, Concierge (a service offered) was rude and abrupt.  That's the start of our stay.  The property is quite large and we had several bags,  we had to ASK for assistance with our luggage,  another thing we have never had to do at other properties.  Turns out they have golf carts to assist guest,  something we were not offered at check in.  I have stayed at several ALL-Inclusive properties in Cozumel and Cancun.  Iberostar Cozumel All Inclusive is the FIRST that only allowed ONE top ( and I use that term lightly) restaurant reservation in the resort.  It's based on how many days you stay, others guests we talked to had the same complaints,  Some stayed 7 days and got two reservations, some stayed longer and got three.  But in NO way is the ALL-inclusive.  Not;3
In no world is this a 5 star resort/hotel.   We stayed in the presidential suite which was old and had a broken lock patio door lock that was jerry  rigged and made us feel uneasy during our stay.   No room service, no bathtub, and a $25 fee for not turning in a beach towel which was taken from us by mistake.   The food was (mostly) edible but the drinks were weak, even when we ordered doubles, and the bar was quick to run out of bananas (literally every day we were there) which were needed to make our favorite drink.   A 3 star experience for sure. Not sure how Iberostar gets away with calling this a 5 star resort. It’s definitely not.;3
The following people in entertainment made our trip extra special Gabriela, Fabian, Angelo, Edgar, Alejandra, Ismael, Stefanie, Karen and May. While Liliana, Alicia and Reyes provided us with exceptional service. We would highly recommend this resort and the people are fun engaging and welcoming.;5
The staff were very friendly including Fabian, Angelo, Gabriella, Daniella and Alejandra. The facilities were excellent! Good food, drinks and shows at night. The views were beautiful! Hope to come back next year!;5
Girls trip. Perfect vacation spot for a girls trip.  Excellent entertainment staff. Shout out to Fabian, Angello, Gabriella, Daniella, Gabriel, Alejandra. Awesome tesm!  Thank you. Hope to visit again sokn.;5
"Unfortunately service, facility & food were not as good as when we visited in Aug 2021. It seemed short staffing in all restaurants & bars and there might be supply chain issue for food.    However, entertainment staffs & shows were great! Thank you for making our stay fun & enjoyable; Angelo, Gabriela, Fabian, Alejandra, Stephanie, Karen & Ismael!  We will be back!   Also, all instructors & staffs at Dressel Diver shop were wonderful.  They were very flexible at our request. Special thanks to Aki, Martin, Julen & Hector!";4
We had a wonderful time! We are definitely coming back! The hotel is very friendly, rooms are clean, food is delicious and the beach is beautiful !  Special thanks to the waiters Jonatan he was so great during our dinners , bartenders Leonel and Elisandra  at the beach bar and all animators.  I wish you guys would have  live music in the evening and the opportunity to dance));5
Karen,  Ismael, Alejandra were so amazing, and the rest of the staff were so accommodating. The entertainment was spectacular and the food was fresh. Best view of the Caribbean I’ve ever seen, we will be back!;5
We had to make an unexpected and last minute accommodation change to the Iberostar Resort and was happy we decided to book our vacation here.  We loved the individual bongaloos nestled throughout the tropical trees/plants.  Grounds were beautiful and lots of staff keeping them well manicured.  Lots of wildlife (peacocks, iguanas, birds, flamingos,  white-nosed coatis) throughout property. Rooms were basic but clean and you had everything you needed.  Great snorkeling off of resort beach but very rocky in the water however they have a pier for easy access to the water that puts you beyond the rocks. We always walked a ways down the beach to snorkel and floated with the current back to the resort…..Saw skates, starfish, trigger fish, rock fish, Barracudas and lots of beautiful;4
This hotel did not disappoint! The employees, Shotsy, Ismael, Alejandra, Angelo, and Karen were friendly and inviting. We made piñatas, played volleyball, had great drinks, and relaxed at the beach. We also went snorkeling, and the water was beautiful!;5
I will start with the things I enjoyed. The grounds are beautiful. I loved that you could get into the ocean from the dock. It made it very easy and there were a ton of fish hanging out by the dock. The staff was wonderful! Now for the things I did not enjoy. The bed was the worst I have ever slept in! Had I wanted to get eaten alive by mosquitoes I would have slept on the porch in the hammock LOL most important advice is to bring bug spray. It cost $30 in the gift shop. You can pick it up in town for $7. Because of the size of the resort and the Maze to get places. It would be helpful to have little signs that told you where things were. It is very easy to get lost. The buffet was okay. My favorite was breakfast. Other than that is very repetitive. We tried the steakhouse and;3
"We stayed at Iberostar Cozumel for a 14 night holiday during early August travelling from the UK as a couple. I will mention that due a 2 hour delay with our flight, and with the fact that we couldn’t fly directly into Cozumel from the UK only into Cancun; having to take several transfers using taxis and the Ferry meant we arrived after a total travel time of approximately 21 hours. This was our first consideration for revisiting Iberostar Cozumel in the first instance immediately realising that we had the return journey to face. On arrival, we were checked in, advised that we could have a meal as the dining room was still open and given our room keys. Initial impression was the hotel appeared very well presented on the approach, in the lobby and main buffet area, staff appeared";4
This is the second time this year we stayed this location.  The entire staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Resort location is perfect for diving.  We really enjoyed the evening entertainment in the lobby.  Can't wait to visit again!;5
My wife and I decided to stay at Iberostar Cozumel for our honeymoon and it was an absolutely amazing experience!!! Everyone from Antonio at the front reception counter to Fidel and Carlos in our dining area were fabulous!!! I highly recommend anyone and everyone to visit this resort if they wish to have an outstating experience with excellent customer service and hospitality.  The food was great with a variety of options.  We stayed in the presidential suite (thanks Antonio) and would never stay any other place other than this again.  The rooms were clean and the beach and entire resort was well kept and beautiful. Fidel definitely took care of us and we really hope to see him and Carlos again one day. We made some good friends and defiantly will be back very soon. A MUST stay;5
The trip was great. Easy check in and a wonderfully cold AC room which is needed after a hot sunny day. The chairs by the pool go fast so get there early. The pool gets warm in the afternoon so its better to cool off in the ocean which was beautiful. Restaurants were ok but the steak house and Mexican. Were the best!  Flamingo areas stinks but it didn't affect our travel.  Overall a great stay, very relaxing, and would definitely return!;5
If your looking for a one stop shop for your dive vacation check out this place.  Everything you need is right here. A place to sleep, restaurants, and a scuba shop on site.  Dressed Divers has a shop and dock right on the property.  You can also grab a taxi if you want to go into town for dinner but there is no need because Iberostar has all the food you can eat.  After all this is an all inclusive hotel.;4
It was nice ish but I wouldn't stay again. Way too many mosquitos at night, the smell was horrible and there is no a/c for the lobby and dinners. Which at first was nice until you try and have a nice dinner just to drip sweat the entire time. The beach was amazing and Elisandra who served us drinks was awesome. She works so hard in the heat. Our glasses were never empty. Miguel who was one of the waiters for the buffet was also amazing. Funny and personable, always got us to laugh. Just all around great at his job. The rest of the staff were nice but those 2 stood out the most.  The food was ok and that's what we expect from an all inclusive so no surprise. All in all not a 5 star resort but we did have a good time.;3
Last minute change of hotels, and so glad I made change  This is my 3rd iberostar property to visit. I like the setup… villas scattered throughout proprty with multiple units in each. Rooms were nice, quiet, beds comfortable. I like the purified water stations to refill bottle provided In the room. All inclusive breakfast and lunch well done. As with most all inclusives, a couple restaurants to choose from each night for dinner..or buffet. Same  menu, Predictable and good food. Surprisingly nice beach (rare in Cozumel), beautiful grounds. Iberostar a win.;5
We had a very fun vacaton with the teenage kids. The entertainment staff is excellent, really the best we have ever had! Kids loved Angelo, Alejandra and all the entertainers. Fun and entertaining shows, we loved them. We enjoyed water aerobics and games and a free scuba lesson in the large pool.   Food and drinks were really pretty good, breakfast was good, some choices got repetitive, but always something to eat. Rooms were perfect for families with ajoining rooms, comfy beds. Bring and wear mosquito spray in the evenings. Although they have some in the rooms, I wanted deet :)   Really beautiful grounds, buildings so cute, wonderful flowers, birds, animals walking around the resort. Snorkeling was amazing, but rocky, bring water shoes (we like crocs). We saw all kinds of fish,;4
THE GROUNDS AND PROPERTY.  GOOD: The landscaping is beautiful. It is very well maintained. It’s sort of a jungle paradise environment. The beach has nice sand on land. The pools are beautiful and well maintained. The location is close to the best scuba diving sites. All the facilities are nice and clean. The location is pretty remote and far away from the town. So if your goal is to stay on the property, then you’re fine.  BAD: The plants are watered daily. Also, there is rain. This allows mosquitoes to breed.  The mosquitoes are ferocious so you MUST use insect repellent. As well, when the property is wet from rain or morning watering, it smells of sewage. Probably because there is sewage nearby on the surface. The beach is nice on land but when you enter the water, you’ll need;4
We had visited Iberostar Cozumel a couple years ago so when we decided to elope it was the perfect place we had in mind.   The resort helps coordinate transportation to and from the airport which made it very easy for traveling with our parents and toddler.   Lina, the wedding coordinator, was absolutely amazing! She helped guide me through the planning process and made sure everything was planned from the rehearsal dinner, flower arrangements, cake (which is included), to the music played before and during the ceremony.  They have relationships with great vendors which made it easy to find a photographer and setup my hair and makeup at the resort's spa. We were able to plan the wedding in about six weeks and it was more beautiful than I could have imagined!   Lina was very;5
This is our second visit and we were so happy once again. We had an ocean front villa right by the pier. Everything was close as this is a smaller resort. The spa is small but the services are great. We are club members and enjoyed the club lounge being near the beach club member area. We loved the Mexican restaurant where the staff were so attentive to our needs and the food was authentic Mexican dishes. We had a birthday the night we went there and Fabian and his crew knocked it out of the park. Raul and Yuremi were so good in the club lounge handling all our needs.  We booked excursions through W2M in the lobby and were very pleased with the service and recommendations.;5
It's a great place, very beutiful, nice, clean. The staff also nice, Gabriela, Angelo very frendly. Many atractions for adults and kids. Restorants have a very fresh and delition food. Just one i does't like that staff wearing the masks, they looks like unhappy, it makes me unhappy too.;4
The resort is a beautiful paradise. Rooms are nice and food is great. Dive shop on property has everything you need for all diving and snorkeling excursions. It's a jungle paradise so bring bug spray. There is an Alamo car rental on site. Rent a Jeep Wrangler to tour the island. We did, and its alot of fun!;5
We as a family had an excellent vacation in this hotel. It’s a quiet place with the private beach and no strangers can access the beach, therefore it feels safe to be here. It has a pretty good selection of food, everyday is something different and tasty. The entertainment is great, everyday is a different show. During the day Gabriela, Ismael, Karen, Angelo, Fabian entertained kids with different kids activities like games, arts and craft, and the staff is very friendly and makes you to be welcome to the place. I would like to come back here!;5
We spent a long weekend (3 nights) with our kids (20 and 16 yrs old). Everything was as good as we could expect. The family room is actually two rooms connected. The rooms are nearly identical in size and layout, except that one has a king bed and the other has two double beds. Our room was in bulging 61, which is midway between the lobby and the pool/beach. We liked the location. The Beach is pretty with a few rocks (water shoes!) and absolutely clear. Very enjoyable. There are kayaks and small sailing boats for the gusts. Pool is nice and has a perfect balance…  not too loud and busy and not to silent! Bar service was always good. Every place we had a meal was great. My kids loved the snack bar at the beach, and I need to confess that we all ended up in love with the;5
The entertainment staff is amazing, they killed it and did an amazing job. Angelo, Favin, Gabriella, Alejandra is a queen, amber, Danielle. The DJs always had it going on, the shows were amazing. Love!!!;5
It was an amazing experience after our last visit about 8 years ago. Being part of The Prestige club is a plus.  The staff was wonderful: Starting with Yuremi from The Club, very professional, caring and always looking after us. Cindy from the breakfast  buffet, excellent service. Reyes at the Prestige bar, super service, but Ana, what a profesional, knowlegeable bar tender with a Huge heart!  The room was wonderful with the maid wonderful in her service. David and Capitán José gave us an excellent service with delicious margaritas from the bartender. The Oriental restaurant was delicious too! Unfortunately the Steak house was a little disapointed… my filet had a very funny taste, like alcohol or some fluid flavor.  Other than that we are definately coming back very soon;5
Very nice food, beach, activities, etc, mexican food is the best.  Definitely I wanna come back as soon as possible!  Ismael, Gabriela, Karen, Rosa and Stefanie are the best!  I loved the flamingos are so cute.;5
We had the most wonderful week at Iberostar. The grounds are beautiful, the food is great, the staff is so pleasant and the entertainment team (Angelo and all the performers) are so talented and give best shows every night.  We will sure return.;5
Josue & Adan best best bartender on resort, very good customer service. Makes sure drinks are good & makes sure you have a good time hanging out at the pool bar in the hotel iberostar. We have a had an amazing trip.;5
The resort is gorgeous! We had an excellent stay. Highlights include the many animals running around the resort (peacocks, flamingos, coatis, iguanas, etc.), Mando in the gym, practicing English and Spanish with each other while I exercised helped the time pass so quickly! And snorkeling with whale sharks, an excursion we arranged through the dive shop. Thank you for a wonderful week!;5
Our trip was made perfect because of Angelo, Fabian.  These 2 guys were always. Smiling and happy. They have the best customer I have ever seen. They made us laugh at the pool and et every place they were. I feel they made our stay perfect;5
Angelo, Fabian,Josue,Adan. All 4 were great customer service always smiling. They made of feel very welcome and always put a smile on our faces. They made our stay. 4 nights we stay here there the best;5
Just got back from an amazing stay! I can honestly say that I have never seen such hard working and dedicated staff who are always so friendly. The entertainment staff were outstanding especially Gabriella, Fabian, Alejandra and Angelo who went above and beyond to keep all guests entertained . They always took the time to chat and get to know you. The shows that the staff put on were fantastic especially the Rock show. The staff really are a credit to the resort. We loved our accommodation which was always perfectly clean and set in lovely well maintained grounds. It was great to see the local wildlife wandering around.;5
It’s our first time in Cozumel, 4th time in an All Inclusive Resort in the Caribbean and we wanted an AI option to make it easy to stay with the kids. We picked Iberostar based on research and reviews and never regretted it one bit. It is perfect? Probably not, but it met and in some ways exceeded our families expectations. We totally feel like we are getting our money’s worth. The rooms are basic, but have everything we need. The set up of the resort is beautiful and the grounds are immaculate. It’s a lot of fun for the kids to see animals and birds around the resort. The beach is beautiful, definitely rocky which we learnt is typical for Cozumel. There’s a pier to get in the water and see lots of fish. As far as the food, we can always find something we like. We tried all of;5
Stayed 8 nights and 7 days they had the best entertainment crew ever. Angelo, Edgar ,Gabriela,Alejandra was the best the room was nice and clean and be sure to use the app the steak house was wonderful along with the Mexican restraunt did not eat at the oriental restraunt but I’m sure it was great too no complaints here. The wildlife was amazing as well. We actually did not have to leave to have fun. But be sure to take water shoes for the beach and snorkeling was great as well.;5
Excellent service. Fabian was wonderful aerobics instructor. Would come back to his class. The whole staff was very hospitable. We loved Fidel from the dining hospitality team. The pool and beach was very clean and we felt well taken care of.;5
Stayed for 5 nights in late August 2022.   Our 1st experience was at the Iberostar Grand Paraiso so our expectations were slightly lower at this location.  Property is exactly what we were expecting, very tropical atmosphere, except for a few items all meals were very good and varied.  Staff was very  courteous.  Pro's:  Excellent location and beautiful beach, on site snorkeling and opportunities for offsite snorkeling and scuba diving.  As previous Iberostar, staff was always courteous and attentive.  Thanks to Jose, Captain of the Steak Restaurant who made sure I got my wine when I needed it, Jose was very polite, courteous, and attentive.  Really enjoyed the Rock show.  Alexandra kept the guest, big and small, entertained with games at night in the Lobby area.  Con's:  We had;5
Monolo hosted the sunset yoga and it was the experience of a lifetime. His calming voice and attitude was just amazing. It made the session fly by and by the end I couldn’t believe 1 hour went past. Definitely recommend!;5
Manolo gave us a beautiful sunset yoga experience, calming our bodies and mind. Looking forward to the other classes offered this week. This was my first beach yoga experience and 10/10!!!! My whole family enjoyed and loved the class.;5
We have been staying here for 10 days and have had an amazing time.  The shows are excellent in there theatre, which is in an amazing setting. The pool activity are amazing and great for all of the family. All the entreatment staff are so friendly and encourage you to try new activities. you really start to form friendships with them as they are so lovely and willing to talk to you especially Angelo, Gabriella , Fabion, Alejandro all four of these staff are a credit to the hotel.;5
I'll keep this review short and sweet.  Iberostar Cozumel felt like home.  The friendly and professional staff was welcoming, attentive and helpful. All of your hard work and energy is greatly appreciated.  To name a few, thank you to Alejandra, Fabulous Fabian, Angelo, Carlos, Gera, Cindy, Rosa, Rogelio and Alexander.  The food was fresh and deeeeeelicious!  The beach was breathtaking.  The rooms were clean and spacious. The evening shows were entertaining.  I would definitely go back.  Loved it all.  Thank you to all of the Iberostar Super Staff.  :);5
Very nice resort.  Entertainment staff was awesome especially Angelo.  The only thing I could say wrong was my son was on crutches so we asked for a wheel chair to make it easier for him to get around. They had a wheelchair but charged us $15 a day to use it.  Other than that everything was wonderful.;5
I was here for the weekend, all the staff has welcomed us as no one has ever done before, I felt at home every minute I spend there, especially thanks to the Guest Assistant Zuri and the Receptionist Rene, for the great service and recommendation about what to do & see that they gave us, they were really charming and helpful! The room, the restaurant, the pool, the breakfast....everything was perfect! Thank you again Iberostar!;5
Iberostar should not be advertising this as a five star resort- it is definitely not even close. Pros: Beach and dock area are nice for swimming and there are some fish to see but not much It is quiet at night time We found the beds comfortable but they need to provide better pillows.  Cons: Rooms are clean but very basic, there is no seating area in the room.  Steak restaurant food was bad Mexican restaurant food was bad Asian restaurant was just ok Service everywhere was slow Red wine was terrible , white ok Pool was dirty  Swim up bar was really dirty No activities for tweens or teenagers  Gym is not air conditioned and has a stench of sewage  Constant stench of sewage by tennis courts The resort credits that they give is just a worthless gimmick.  Mixed drinks were not good;2
Great holiday! We had a great time at the iberostar, from check-in to check-out. The food was good, the rooms clean and comfortable, perfect beach (swimming shoes are a must- but no seaweed at all- beautiful crystal clear water ! ). The staff was amazing, in particular the star camp for the kids (Ismael, Karen and Rosa) and star friends teams (Gabi and Fabian), they are so friendly that makes a huge difference in your stay :) !  Also there is a nice balance between activities and music around the pool area.;5
This is great property.  Love the little jungle concept with boongalows. So refreshing. Their Star Camp for kids is amazing. Kudos to Karen, Rosa and Ismael! You made it really memorable! We will come again!;5
Had a great time in Iberostar. The dinner was great. I made my both my reservations at the steak house as I read in previous reviews that it was the best one. The lunch buffet was a little more selective so we tended to eat more a breakfast and had a lighter lunch. The night time shows were great, Danny is very talented. The service was great, Glendy our main server always remembered us. The entertainment team was great, very friendly and went out of the way to make sure everyone was included. A special shout out to Gabby, Ismael, Karen and Fabian on the entertainment team that alway made sure we were having a good time!;5
Loved my stay at iberostar! Great food and fun! Activities and food! Loving the pools and drinks. Archery and crafts are great and im an adult. Snorkeling by the ocean and buffet at night! Fabian Ishmal and Gabby from actvities were so fun! Fernando was a great host at the buffet! Glendy and Milton were wonderful servers at dinner. The wildlife here is amazing! Iguanas flamingos! Danny from the rock show stole the show and all week for nightly entertainment.;5
Wonderfull resort, very commited to sustainability, trying to manege the always difficult balance between tourism and nature,  The staff is very professional, everything was perfectly clean. The food was great, with a lot of different choices that can satisfy the most demanding tastes.;5
Better than staying in Playa Del Carmen! The beach was so clear that we could see a LOT of fishes even star fishes. When we went snorkeling it was amazing there was a few different types of fishes and we even saw some stingrays! Make sure to take some water shoes because the beach is very rocky and you for sure do not want to be stung by a stingray. The rooms were nice too but our only concern is when we showered the water was cold then warm then hot for some reason. I also think the beds need more pillows we only got 2 for each bed and we were a group of 4 so we each got 1 pillow. The pool was also pretty nice there was a bar at the pool too I recommend to get a non  alcohol drink called fresada those were good. They also took your orders when you outside the pool chilling. My;5
The iberostar cozumel it's an amazing place to spend your holidays if you are planning to visit the Caribbean with your family or if you are looking to start or continue your subacuatic adventures diving. The resort has tons of entertainment activities, like trivias, shows, archery,volley competitions, etc. All of them family friendly. The entertainment team, specially Alejandra, puts a lot of work to make you feel the best way possible.  If your goal is to have an amizing diving experience, there are boars constantly leaving for diving, you can do many certifications and see a lot of the subacuatic life. As the only downsides, the diving center is not associated wit Padi and the beach entrance it's rocky (you can walk 15 mins and you'll have some amizing spots rock free);5
Iberostar was amazing! The entertainment team was awesome and kept us busy with lots of activities and shows! Food and drinks were great with a variety of different foods for every meal. Fabian, Gabriela and Angelo made this trip one to never forget!;5
Disappointed  Let me start by saying that I had stayed at this resort multiple times prior to the pandemic. On those occasions it was a well run, fun place to be with lots of great entertainment. Sadly it would seem that it has not recovered from the toll the pandemic took on it. Entertainment was very limited and not a patch on what it had been.  One other notable diff was the presence of people off cruise ships - I guess they pay to visit the resort which is unfortunate because they put a strain on an already very lean staff not to mention there’s not enough sun chairs to go around either!  Very disappointing experience and we will prob never return.  Definitely not what it used to be - not even close.;3
Grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Staff was very friendly. Steakhouse was delicious!  Star friends, Angelo, Gabriella and Fabian made our days and evenings! Days at activities, they kept everyone involved.  Pool games were a blast! Evening shows were great! Highly recommended for family/friends. We had a group of 10.;5
Have stayed here 3 times. It is small and the facilities not up to the (high) standards of other Iberostar resorts. But it offers great value and the size may suit families with smaller kids. Food is OK - we always found something good to eat at the buffet.  We enjoy taking the Ultramar ferry over from Playa - all part of the holiday journey.  Decent snorkelling and Dressel are on hand for scuba - we tried their discover scuba package - recommended. We are already planning our next trip there.;4
My review for the past week   Food Was mediocre at best I did enjoy the Asian restaurant and I have to say the staff in the specialty restaurant was much more attentive than the Buffet that is to be expected.￼ The staff in the Buffet almost refused to bring you anything to drink on most days and I’m more concerned about where you’re sitting  than if you’ve actually have silverware. I have had worse food at resorts but it was simply just not the best.  The rooms were very clean and well done but however most of the people I talk to and myself included found the air-conditioning to be so poor it could not even keep the sheets dry on the bed. Clothes hung up to dry when simply remain exactly as damp as they were￼￼. They did a very good job cleaning the rooms and we’re very;3
Iberostar Star camp for kids is lovely as it is small, fun and  warm. The team is super personable, professional and show great respect for childhood constantly ensuring that kids are happy and having fun in a safe environment. Ismael, Rosa and Karen are the very best!;5
In general the resort was a beautiful place to visit. The drinks were to die for and the fruit is the best I’ve had. The cleaning service was amazing considering the sand we would track in from the beach! The pool activities were fun and a good challenge and the beach activities were also enjoyable.  The shows were also so much fun but disco night was the best. And a special mention to Angelo and Alejandra for being the bestest!;5
This was my first time at an Iberostar resort and from reviews and price I  was expecting to be blown away compared to where I usually stayed. The service was good, the food at the buffet breakfast/lunch/dinner was good. I could only get white wine, no choices as to the type. The Steak house was sub-par with the steak not being very good, and very slow service. The Asian restaurant was very good, and the Mexican restaurant was good. The quality of the cocktails varied significantly from one bar to another, some of them were undrinkable.   Our room was missing the door guard at the bottom so there was an inch gap at the bottom which allowed in many many mosquitoes, unfortunately we didn't notice this until 2 days before we left.  The entertainment was good, however we had a bad;3
Just returned from a relaxing and fun filled vacation from Cozumel Iberostar with family and friends.  The star friends were great especially Angelo, Gabriela Fabio and Ismal.  They made the pool games fun and the night shows awesome.  Bartender Leonel made the best drinks.;5
We stayed for two weeks with our teenagers, diving was amazing the best, our teenage son qualified for his open water, brilliant access to the reef, snorkelling from the beach for non fivers. Very tranquil, not built up lovely sunset walks along the beach.  everything very well run food excellent staff v helpful and friendly. Beach volleyball and tennis particularly favourite for us, beautiful gardens with wildlife v tame, peacocks flamingoes iguanas raccoons !;5
We had a fantastic time at this resort! We especially enjoyed the entertainment team. Big shout out to Gabriella, Fabian, and Angelo who made sure we were all having a great time. The food was tasty and they had a wide variety to choose from. The drinks were plentiful and well-poured. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It is clear that the staff takes pride in their work. We will definitely be back and will gladly recommend this resort to others!;5
Food was amazing, facilities amazing.  The staff were great. Manolo from a fitness center was a favorite of all the staff. He was a joy to talk to and amazing yoga and Zumba instructor. Highly recommend his classes.;5
We absolutely loved the Iberostar! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. We took our 2 year old daughter on this trip, and everyone treated her excellent and made all of us feel so welcome. We loved it;5
"This was our chosen destination for a long delayed family reunion. The layout may seem like a maze, specially at night, but it grows on you. The sight of the local fauna, the iguanas, flamingos, coatis and so on, as well as the lush vegetation is always heartwarming and keeps you on your feet.  The food could be better; I'm looking at you cheese, non-local frozen seafood, and a couple others. There is a definite need to source more product locally, such as fruits and fish.  Most of the staff was an outright pleasure to interact with. I have to particularly mention Manolo, the gym, pilates, and yoga instructor, for the customized and effective exercises he showed me to take care of a chronically painful lower back. Oh, and Rosa, all smiles and kindness.  In all, a great";4
Had a fabulous time at this resort. The restaurants/buffets were tasty and the hammock outside each of the residences, was a nice touch.  I came to Cozumel for the diving and the dive company on-site, Dressel Divers, was fantastic. The staff was friendly and helpful and each of the Divemasters, that I dove with, was knowledgeable and embodied what a Divemaster should be.  I usually try not to stay in the same place twice, but if I do make it back Cozumel some day, I may break that habit.;5
I liked it a lot. I made a lot of friends. Food was amazing  . We love alejandre. She did an amazing job. We had fun at the bar with all of our fiends and at all of the shows that the people hosted. The beach had a lot of rocks but it was still fun;5
Cute, clean, quaint place with amazing hospital people! The animals and greenery really make it unique and beautiful to walk through. Shoutout to the entertainment team esp Angelo, Alejandra and Gabriella! Thx for all the laughs. Buffet food was amazing - thx chef Saul!! Wi-Fi and mobile app could improve. Overall great time and experience.;4
We just finished a six day trip to the Iberostar Cozumel with our daughters, ages 8 and 12.  The staff was so great, and there was something for everyone to enjoy.  My youngest LOVED the Star Camp for kids.  She made lots of friends and enjoyed the unique activities that changed daily.  Ismael and Rosa were AMAZING!!  They went above and beyond to make sure that the kids had an absolute blast all week.  The entertainment crew, especially Angelo and Fabian (water aerobics superstar), were fantastic, and Isidro at the swim up pool bar kept the drinks flowing for both the kids and adults.  The ocean is clear as drinking water, and you can snorkel right off the hotel dock.  We are sad to leave but can’t wait to return!;5
This is our second time staying at the Iberostar and both times were great. The rooms are comfy and clean, the food is surprisingly good for an AI, the staff are helpful and welcoming. We used Dressel for many dives and they too were excellent!;5
Wow!  Another amazing stay at the Iberostar!  Check-in was quick and easy with Isabel.   Love the new wristbands with the room key attached.   The staff is always so nice and once again made our stay perfect.  We come twice a year and many of the staff have become part of our family.   Angelo is the best and always keeps us entertained and laughing.   You’ll miss out if you don’t try his water aerobics.  Look for Gabriela and Fabian around the pool…. They are amazing.   Cindy is our go to for breakfast and lunch, guarantee she’ll take great care of you.  Our room was clean, air conditioning worked great.  Housekeeping kept our fridge stocked.    We don’t make reservations at the restaurants as the buffet has a great selection and never disappoints.   If you have time make a;5
Iberostar Cozumel was my family's favorite place we have stayed in Cozumel. The beach is just unbeatable. It had everything we needed for a relaxing vacation: good food options, unlimited drinks, opportunities for exercise - I loved playing beach volleyball with Angelo, Edgar, and Alejandra, and as a family we loved yoga on the beach with Manolo (highly recommend!). The entire staff was friendly and helpful. We keep talking about when we can go back.;5
The Cozumel location is the perfect place to unwind and relax. The entertainment team- Angelo, Fabian, Alejandra, Karen, Ismael are great! All the waiting staff, housekeeping and ground keepers do an amazing job daily! The Spa ladies Beatriz, Paola and Rufina have magical hands. The Prestige concierge were all great as well as Ana in the VIP bar. Ana was great to talk to and always made the best drinks. My father-in-law had a fall by the pool and the whole team came to our rescue and made sure he was taken care of immediately. That was the best service ever! Again, many props to the entire Iberostar team.;5
The Iberostar Resort in Cozumel was fabulous in so many ways! The workers were always pleasant, smiling n courteous. The food was terrific with a great variety. The rooms and grounds were clean n fresh. The entertainment was lively and fun and the Dressel Divers are superb. I give this resort a 5+.;5
Had a great vacation. The entertainment group was amazing and there were plenty of activities for adults and children. Shout out to Angelo, Fabian , Gabriella , Alejandra , and Vladimir the DJ, they were always smiling and ready to go.  All in all, great time;5
This is a beautifully unique resort with great staff, good food and everything you need for a relaxing time. Me and my wife thought the food was good, the drinks were very good with very friendly bartenders who remembered what we liked and didn’t mind making them as strong as you could handle. The water was crystal clear and the beach setup was very nice. The first 15-20 feet of water is very rocky so maybe think about bringing water shoes. If you don’t it’s no problem because they have a dock and stairs that will get you in past the rocks. Once in the water you’ll literally be swimming with the fishes as tropical fish swim right around you in the crystal clear water. My wife and I didn’t do any diving but spoke to several people that did and they all said it was great. Bring;4
Everything was clean and all staff were friendly.  We never felt rushed or felt like we were in a big crowd.  The entertainment staff were friendly, talented and funny.  The hamburger grill was delicious!  All restaurants had great food.  This was a perfect vacation for our family.;5
We loved this resort. The villas are so much nicer than a regular hotel. The beach has a good amount of seating. We never had a problem finding chairs. The beach is rocky so water shoes are a must for the beach. The dive shop has snorkeling gear, kayaks and small catamarans for free. However, you have to pay a $5 pp eco fee in cash to use them and can only use during certain times (9:30-11:30 & 1:30-3:30) which was no problem, I just wish I would have known to avoid wasting time.  Beach and Pool Bars could definitely use a second bartender at all times. It was almost impossible to get a drink at the swim up bar in the pool.  Food in general is good. It is hot in August and the breakfast buffet and the steakhouse  restaurants have no AC, so yes it was hot.  The Asian and Mexican;5
Very picturesque place, you walk and you find a lot of beautiful fauna. For its part, the sea is accessed through a pier because there are many stones. I want to highlight Manolo, the gym instructor, very willing to help, paying attention to how we do the exercises and providing all his wisdom with great dedication.;5
"Great as a dive resort.  Food and grounds real nice. Nice beach 20 min walk away, beach in front of hotel is real rocky. Night life is nilly.  Rooms are bungalow style, lots of walking. 20 dollar taxi ride away from town. Biggest complaint would be how they slow down the bar service on the beach; there is always a wait.";4
So where to begin?  The property itself is lovely in the common areas & the front desk staff were friendly and efficient, but the lobby, buffet and lunch dining facilities are open air and therefore uncomfortably hot - as in swelteringly hot & humid.   The room itself (2601) smelled of mildew and the thermostat was locked so we couldn’t adjust the room temperature down to our preferences. That said, we did adjust to the temperatures after about three nights. There were small bugs on the bureau. Not good at all!   We asked for extra pillows one night, had to call twice and a third time the next day before we finally got them for the next night.   On the third day we asked that they restock our fridge with Diet Coke and they pushed back saying we would have to exchange other items;3
The dive shop keeps this place in business otherwise the slow service, lack of air conditioning, poor bar and food availability would run off many people.  They only staff each bar with one bar tender so getting a drink is painfully slow.  The restaurants do not have air conditioning so you will be sweating while eating.  Food is hard to get at (the good stuff runs out quickly and they are very very slow to replenish, most of the good food is behind plexiglass so you have to wait for a restaurant employee to get it for you but they are always tied up busy with something else so you wait and wait).  They rarely refill your drinks in the buffet restaurants.  Water is always cool/lukewarm but never cold and keep in mind you are sitting in a dining area with no air conditioning.;2
We have stayed at Iberostar Maya twice and found the Cozumel Iberostar to be very underwhelming. It’s a smaller resort so we were expecting less but not to the level we encountered.  The beach is lovely with clear water and lots of fish to see under the pier.  The staff is friendly and the entertainment team, especially Angelo, are lots of fun.  We enjoyed the shows but there is not one every night.  I like that Iberostar is anti-plastic and they have re-fillable glass water bottles in your room.  Not a big deal to walk to a water station to fill up.     Now, the disappointing aspects.  We had connecting rooms and one had a mildew smell. We soon find out it was because the AC was leaking from the ceiling creating a mess on the bathroom floor.  Maintenance was quick to respond;3
So many fun things to do!  Beautiful place! This is the most beautiful, welcoming and thoughtful resort.  The kid’s club is wonderful!  Ismael and Rosa are so patient and great with the children.  Activities like archery, sandcastle building, tie-dying - always something going on.    The resort is absolutely beautiful in an old world Mexico kind of way.  Our room was elegantly simple and just right. The air conditioning worked well.    Everyone is friendly, the other tourists are polite and gregarious.  Drinks are excellent, food is delicious.  I have never been to an AI resort that served jumbo colossal shrimp nightly on a buffet.  Bbq by the beach during the day.    Wonderful snorkeling really got off of the resort pier and picturesque beach.  It does not get much better,;5
Manolo is fantastico. Yoga classes in the moraine are a perfect way to start your day and wake up your body. It will fit you if you are a starter or an advanced yogi. You will do it next to beach in a perfect setting in full harmonie with thé surrounding nature. You will be able to listent to the sea waves, to bords, to Manolo directions in Spanish and English. You will be able to do it at the sunset to finish your day on a high before a good refreshment on the beach. Highly recommended;5
Stayed here as a Scuba Dive destination. The facilities were fine, the staff was very accommodating and did their best to assure our stay was pleasant. The rooms and grounds are well kept and clean. We've stayed here 10 or 12 times so the food, although fresh and abundant, did become repetitive. I would definitely recommend this resort for a stress free stay.;3
We stayed in a suite, second floor, and they were painting our building the whole time, there were tarps everywhere, dripping paint on our scuba gear that was drying on our deck area, I almost fell once trying to navigate the tarp lying across the stairway.  It was just not necessary, could they go paint another unoccupied building?  That being said, we loved the suite (our 17th time staying here). The food has improved greatly!  The Star Friends were staffed low, I felt sorry for the ones working so hard, they were really fun, and Angelo is a hoot!  We just wished the painters (hard working don't get me wrong, not their fault, I'm sure they are told where to go, what to paint) had stayed out of our way more.  My husband is a contractor, he said the project manager could have;3
WE LOVED OUR STAY HERE!! it was a super awesome resort. The food is good at the buffet and restaurants. The snack bar was on point! and we don’t drink so all the virgin drinks and sodas we got were delicious!! We had a standard room here and it was just right!! last but not least the ENTERTAINMENT TEAM WAS SOOO GREAT!! From the pool games to the nightly entertainment it was the best just to mention a few, Angelo, Alejandre, Gabriela, and Fabian. They are all amazing and knew us by name just after a couple days and became our very best friends!!;5
Manolo’s yoga class was wonderful. he went through each pose step by step and made sure we were comfortable. i enjoyed his class thoroughly and will be taking his pilates and yoga classes for the rest of my stay.;5
We are visiting currently and having a wonderful time! The entertainment team has made our days fun filled and the evenings have had amazing shows! Thank you! Rosa, gabbi, Fabian, Karen, ismael we’re so fun while painting!;5
Very nice place to stay staff went above and beyond. Nice pool with an ocean view, water tours snorkeling, fishing etc., can pick you up right at their dock.  Food needs a little work, room clean and comfortable.;5
This resort is great for families. It's a beautiful jungle setting with bungalow rooms. It's not extravagant luxury but laid back relaxed vibe. The staff are all great especially Alejandro and the entertainment staff. The food is ok, nothing to write home about. They do a fantastic job of being as eco friendly as possible.;4
Our first visit to Iberostar Cozumel was an absolute delight! The property is so well kept and beautifully landscaped providing a wonderful habitat for the birds and animals roaming around.  The food options are more than adequate with surprisingly healthy and tasty offerings.  The buffet, beach snack shack, and Asian restaurant were our favorites! Our rooms met all of our needs and we especially loved the hammocks on the front porch, taking our 'lounging' time outside to enjoy the landscape and wildlife. Use the provided mosquito repellent .  Any AC issues we had were addressed quickly and to our satisfaction- understanding It is a humid tropical island.   We are not big on group activities or entertainment, but the staff had us hooked and we enjoyed and appreciated their hard;5
One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Located 10 min taxi ride from the center of Cozumel. Beautiful property with very interesting layout and beautiful manicured gardens. Many animals on the property snd my kids were somhappy to watch the flamingoes and different birds. Great swimmingpools for the kids and you can snorkel and see fish just on the beach. The food is lovely, clean and a lot to choose from. The staff is so polite snd helpful with everything. My kids 6 and 11 years spent some time in the kods club and had a great time. The staff is very attentive and kind. A special thank you to Rosa, Karen and Ismael for making the stay extra super for our kids. There is also a lot of entertainment during the day like beachvolley, yoga and water aeeobics. It is a super relaxing;5
Had a great vacation. This resort was recommended by a friend who's a dive instructor and it was amazing even though we don't die. The resort is beautiful and the rooms are incredible. I met Manolo at the gym and he helped me with some Fitness and some language skills. Highly recommend the yoga on the beach.  I'm at Rossa on Thursday at the yoga on the beach. They have a whole place here for kids and she works there. She clearly enjoys what she does.  Resort was great, but I'm ready to get back to my normal food after 7 Days of the phase. My wife and daughter are already lobbying for a couple extra days next year.;5
We traveled as a group of 14 ranging in age from 15 to 68. When making reservations for dinner there was mass confusion by the staff as to whether there were 13 or 15, there were 14, this couldn't be changed in the computer. 2 of the rooms the ac did not work and the maintenance staff had to be called twice, 1 room had electrical issues. The bell staff were very curious in assisting my mother back and forth by picking her up in the golf cart. The wait staff at the beach and pool were great and efficient! The restaurants did not want to seat a table of 14 they would seat 2 tables of 7.  The grounds were beautifully kept, the wildlife on the resort are plentiful.  Overall my family and friends had a good time with a few bumps along the way.;3
My overall experience was very good. The check in was horrible, I arrived at 2 pm I was told to wait till 3 at was told 4pm. At 4pm requested to speak to a manager at this point we were the only ones waiting for a room. Other people that had the same issue were being compensated with upgrades. I was not even offered an apology. The hotel is very clean the pool is very well maintained and the beach is clean of sargassum.  If you want continuous service at the beach and pool area I would suggest to bring dollars to tip as that is the driver for waiters. We are in room 8414 ocean view pool view great for access to beach chairs. The restaurant all have great variety and easy access to get reservations.  Entertainment team is what made our stay memorable, Fabian,Angelo, Alejandra,and;4
This is my fourth visit to Iberostar Cozumel and it was even better this time around. My sister and I went together just to relax and unwind. We spent most of our time on the beach or in the ocean. The water is crystal clear with lots of beautiful fish, starfish, rays, etc. No fancy gear needed, just a $30 mask and snorkel and we were in heaven.  I enjoyed having a custom-made omelet every morning, and my sister swears the burger at the beach snack hut was the best she’s ever tasted. I’m sure we were starving after being in the water so long!  I’d planned on going to Alberto’s next door but was pleasantly surprised by the number of dinner seafood options they had this time.  As usual, the abundance of wildlife was a huge delight. I was especially happy to see the coatis running;5
I have to say and I have been here four times! In 2004, 2012,2016 and 2022.  The rooms look cozier than before, super clean, small and comfortable.   All the waiters do their best, so make sure you tip them.   The Star Camp staff (Ismael, Rosa, and Karen) took amazing care of my four year old, they are really sweet and made my daughter feel comfortable to spend the day with them. She really  liked the bracelet activity, making puzzles, the passport and playing with balls in the pool. Do not hesitate to leave  your children here. They were really kind and my daughter was super happy with them.  I am so impressed about how eco friendly they are. They’ve got responsible fishing, they have eco friendly amenities, and they are trying to be a waste free hotel in 2025.   The beach is;5
Service wasn't good. There were waiters and waitresses around  but they were not helpful it was easier just to get up yourself and get what you wanted. The bar was always super slow. Not sure if they were short on staff or its always like this but slow and pretty much easier just to do it yourself. They also say on website activities are free but there is a national park so you have to pay a national park fee per day. It's also very rocky beach because of this. It was pretty but they should let you know before you get there and not say the water activities are FREE. THEY ARE NOT!! Its near impossible to get reservations at the places to eat too. Your choices were always buffet. We did get one night of reservations at steak house and there was two other tables and the rest were;2
This was our first time staying in Cozumel and it was a great experience! Loved the resort, night time activities, especially the rock concert, food was great, drinks were adequate, beach area was beautiful and it was not overcrowded. Bed was comfortable with adequate size bedroom. We will be back!;5
Everything staff Gabriela and Fabian are awesome. Great job entertaining. Rooms were clean, Dressel drivers are awesome. Especially Flo and Santiago! Thanks for making our trip awesome. Will be back soon.;5
I came to Cozumel to get dive certified with Dressel Divers and had an amazing time! Great staff both at the dive shop and throughout the resort. Lots of entertainment throughout the day and into the night and one of the staff members, Anglelo, was so much fun. Great food and drinks. I’d definitely come again. I love that iberostar is environmentally friendly as well.;5
This resort was amazing!! We had plenty to do on and off the resort!  With the help of Gabriel and Fabian we where completely entertained every day in and out of the pool. Thank you so much and will see you next year.;5
This hotel was pretty awesome. I was surprised about how sustainable they are. Beautiful layout with all kinds of animals that run through there (flamingos, parrots, iguanas) kinda cool to see up close. Food was awesome and drinks. I was able to dine in all the restaurants during my stay. Had a variety of options which is great. The best part is that there are so many activities to do at the resort. They have activities for kids and adults. My teenaged son loved to do them all! The staff who hosted alot of the activities (hope I got the names right) Angelo, Fabian, Gabriella and I can't remember the name of the lady that usually host the night games in the lobby I think Alejandra . All 4 of them were very fun to be around and super nice. They were the friendliest and definitely;5
This place and the staff are so awesome. The staff is so polite and always looking to get you included in activities and make sure your happy. Angelo has made me feel so welcome and keeps putting a smile on my face. The night entertainment is the best part of the whole resort. The bartenders are very quick and make the best drinks. If you are wanting to have the best time of your life visit Iberostar in Cozumel!!!;5
Seventh time coming here and each visit becomes a new experience. Exceptional staff and a very cheerful entertainment team. Their rock and boogie shows ara spectacular. Ale, Ângelo, Fabian, Gabriel, Gabriela, Ismael, Karen, Rosa, Manolo, Daniel, Estefany, Ámbar.;5
If you like to be in a room with ants everyday then go to this resort.  Foods were bad, the buffet is not good, having same things for 7 days is not pleasant.  Room was so small, air conditioning was not working, we had to call and keep on calling until they sent someone to work on it. Not worth it.;2
Great time, friendly  staff. Special thanks to Alejandranda and the entertainment team who made a pleasant stay. Rooms are excellent. Restaurants are very clean and the scenery is amazing. If you go try out the las dos Maria's Mexican restaurant. You would ve amaze;5
We love the atmosphere here and come back everytime. It’s not a typical hotel feel and we love that. You can snorkel right off the beach. Also you can walk down the beach and eat at a local restaurant! The massage is a must!;5
Our family just returned from a wonderful stay at Iberostar Cozumel. Rooms were cool, clean, and comfortable.  The food was varied, fresh, and delicious. Something for  everyone. Staff, Angelo, Eduardo, all bartenders, food service, front desk were helpful and accommodating.  The entertainment was different every night and we loved every show. There is diving with Dressel Divers straight from the dock. Snorkeling directly under the dock is some of the best. Look for star fish they are all over. Be sure to bring water shoes and your own snorkel.This resort is full sustainability as well, adding to the quality. You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here.;5
A beautiful place and everything was great other than the bed and pillows were hard as rocks. Good food and good service. Resort employees were always pleasant and helpful. The dive shop on the resort was outstanding as well.;4
"Excellent resort for the mature crowd. We enjoyed snorkeling & basic scuba diving. We love early morning swims in ocean with local sea life. I recommend snorkeling excursion & basic dive class/excursion. Our 30 -45 yrs old youngsters did several dives & advanced excursion scuba diving(excellent diving team at Iberostar;Dressell diving.";5
The resort is great...back to pre-COVID levels. We loved the activity & entertainment staff--Alejandra, Angelo, Eduardo, Alejandra, Amber & Danny. They offer games and activities during the day and night and awesome nightly shows in the theater. The bartenders & staff are wonderful. The grounds are lovely. Lots of wildlife! Definitely recommend the Iberostar Cozumel!;5
Absolutely phenomenal, Alejandra was a perfect entertainer and treated everyone as if they were a celebrity. She absolutely deserves a raise and is the greatest asset at this resort. She is purely the reason I’ll be coming back.;5
The beautiful Alejandra & the amazing Angelo made our trip worth it! They were so much fun & brought so much energy! Definitely would come back just to see them! Edgar is awesome as well. This was our second time here at Iberostar Cozumel & it gets better everytime!;5
We just stayed here in July 2022. The resort is very nice and situated in lush garden that make for serene surroundings. The beach is wonderful with excellent snorkeling right from the dock. What really made this trip for us was the kids Star Camp that was offered at Iberostar. Rosa and Karen were absolutely phenomenal with my kids and had great activities planned daily. My husband and I were able to dive when the kids went to start camp. Without this amenity we would not have been ablate dive together. The tie-dye t-shirts were such a great souvenir and my kids cannot wait to come back. The food at the resort lacked as did the coffee sadly but other than that it was a great trip.;4
Wanted a good couples get away nice resort staff not so much & beds not good at ALL. Food was so so drinks was ok. Just expecting better trip such as cancun but was just ok not good. Staff was not very friendly acted like chore if you ask for anything;2
This was my first time visiting and I know we will be returning next year! Everything is nearby and so convenient.  The entertainment group was amazing keeping us all informed of activities.  Thank you to Fabian, Alejandra, Edgar and Angelo on a excellent job done!   Danny and Amber did a great job singing in the Horror Show! I was most impressed with the acrobatic skills. Edgar, Angelo and the their female team member did great! Excellent! It was amazing!;5
We 100% plan to be back next summer!!  This place is amazing.  The staff is so friendly - they give attention to every detail.  We had so much fun with the entertainment staff - Alejandra, Angelo, Fabian and Edgar were the life of the party every day.  The pool and beach games are fun and different each day - you just never know what’s going to happen, and it’s always inclusive of EVERYONE that wants to play.  We made dream catchers, played soccer bowling, and learned to samba and bachata.  We had so much fun as a family!   The waitstaff is impeccable - we loved Glendy, Milton, Adolfo, and Dierde (sp?) each day in the buffet.  They were were so observant and accommodating.  Liliana at the bar by the pool was one of my favorites - she ALWAYS had a smile and was so quick to pick;5
Need better quality of food and more options of sit down restaurants rather than buffet. I struggled to find food i liked.  Prefer air conditioned dining vs open air. Pool could stand a chiller for really hot months, kinda like bath water. Overall a great trip and beautiful grounds.;3
Our experience with the resort was perfect!  The star camp was great - Ismael and Rosa were so helpful!!  Having dressel diver on site was awesome!  Room was clean and the restaurants were awesome.  I loved the size of the resort - everyone was so friendly!;5
This was our 5th summer at Iberostar Cozumel and once again we had a spectacular vacation. We spent the days lounging on the beach sipping cocktails or participating in one of the many activities led by the fabulous entertainment team. Fabian and Angelo kept it fun during some water exercise and Alejandra made the afternoon games a blast. These three worked their booties off from day to night. We also had an amazing server, Rogelio, at the morning and lunch buffet. He even introduced us to a new drink that was sure to chase away any hangover. I cannot wait to come back next summer. Our family has tried other  resorts but nothing compares to the atmosphere at Iberostar Cozumel.;5
This was our first time to Cozumel and first time in MX! The staff at Iberostar are one of a kind, world class, and truly make you feel at home. During our stay, Alejandra checked in with us anytime we saw her, asked us questions about the activities we did outside of the resort, she was the best. This was our first time at an all-inclusive type of resort, it is amazing for about 3 days then we got restless! Thankfully, we were able to arrange a car AT the resort, get Taxi's easy to downtown to explore, and the staff were always willing to help answer our questions. Not only are we sold on Iberostar Cozumel, we are sold on Iberostar. Gracias, Cozumel!;5
Restaurants a little disappointing - only 2 fine dinner reservations allowed for a 4-night stay. But the buffets are fine. A great value experience. Friendly staff. Pools, beaches and restaurants not overcrowded. Facilities well-kept, rooms clean. Took a while to learn our way around. Would return.;4
Iberostar has a beautiful layout that makes you feel like you are in the jungle.  There is wildlife all around. The beach area is great and the pier is an extra bonus.  There are tons of fish that hang out under the pier which makes for some great snorkeling.  The entertainment crew is AWESOME and we directly interacted with Edgar and Angelo.  The shows were fun but I am not sure that the Horror show(not really scary) is appropriate for kids.  We watched one family leave right after the opening scene. Edgar and Angelo did a great job getting our 21-year-old and 18-year-old involved in daily activities.  Our daughter even won a hula hoop contest.  Our room(5304) was just average.  The AC worked great, but the bed was very hard.  The rooms were VERY clean. For some reason, we only;3
We had an amazing vacation!! The Entertainment is great. Angelo, Edgar, and Alejandra are so much fun between archery, volleyball, pool games and the shows at night they are humble and so much fun!!!!;5
We had a great stay! The food was good and it’s conveniently located near some of our favorite beaches. The pier makes pick up for local excursions simple and easy.  I look forward to visiting Iberostar Cozumel again :);4
We went to this resort because it has Dressel dive shop on site. The hotel property is kinda cool with all the wildlife and cute, updated cottages but there are a lot of downfalls. First, they only let you make reservations three times, we were there for 7 nights, was really disappointing, we had to eat the same thing every day. Nothing has air conditioning! Even the steak house is open, it is brutally hot! They have fans but nothing works! The lobby where they do activities at night is miserable! Again, most fans are broken. Same with the show/stage area. The daily activities are weak and boring. This resort needs a lot of updates and way more fun activities. It was ok but I would not go back. Also, the pool is literally like a hot tub, way to hot! The best part is the ice and;3
Spent a week here at the resort with the family including our pre-teen child.   Swim up bar was always a gathering place and the drinks were poured heavily.   Food options were plentiful and should please the pickiest of eaters. In other boards, some complained on the food. I found nothing wrong and was surprised to find artisanal items like Jamon from Spain and great cheese. Remember, this isn’t the US and things aren’t necessarily done the “American” way.   The entertainment team works their tails off every day. They do a great job of keeping the resort fun and friendly. For example, Angelo who you’ll see everywhere leading activities by the pool or beach is also a talented dancer who preformed 5 of the 7 nights at the evening show.   The kids club (Star Club) worked hard to;5
We had a wonderful week at Iberostar. Manolo’s fitness classes were a nice way to start the day. I wish he taught one every morning.  I really liked the live music in the evenings, David was my favorite.  Everyone is very friendly, especially the entertainment staff Edgar and Angelo.  My family loves the scuba diving and it is so convenient on site.  This was our third trip there and I’m sure we’ll be back.;5
I stayed at the Iberostar in Cozumel with my family for a week and had an amazing time. The resort offers so many activities and opportunities that you won’t find at many other all inclusives. When we weren’t relaxing on the beach or at the swim up bar, we took advantage of the fitness classes (I think we did every single class offered by Manolo, including Pilates, yoga, and Zumba), water aerobics with Angelo, snorkeling right off the resort, and enjoying the entertainment team’s incredible performances. We got to know Edgar from the team really well throughout our trip. In addition to the show every night, there were games and live music in the lobby. I also did a resort dive with Flo, who was an incredible teacher both in the pool sessions and during our time in the water!;5
This was third trip to the island and our second time staying here. We are happy to report it was better than our first trip 7 years ago!   The grounds were still gorgeous and well maintained, the food was better than we remembered. The main buffet was our favorite!! The staff were incredibly nice, Ivonne was the sweetest host , the evening shows put on by the entertainment team were so much fun to watch especially Angelo! Thanks for another beautiful trip we will be back soon!;5
My trip was so amazing! All of the staff was so friendly and the entertainment team was very entertaining and fun. There was always so much to do I was never bored! Very thankful for my trip to iberostar cozmuel;5
"Pros Location, food on buffet was wonderful- huge variety, cute ""huts"", eco- friendly amenities, beach, snorkeling and diving on location and the reef was close by. Cons no regulators in shower- hot/cold right after each other, bellhops put 4 people and 5 pieces of luggage in a small taxi- too hot";4
Iberostar Cozumel never disappoints us. We had an amazing time!  Ask for Manolo Carmana at the gym or follow him to the pool to participate in water aerobics or morning yoga and afternoon zumba. Wow!  Overall, it was an amazing trip. Ask for “Ro” (Rojelio)  or Cindy or Ivonne during breakfast buffet or lunch buffet! The entertainment team was awesome!  Ask for Angelo or Alejandra! - Diane, Melissa, Becky, and Jason;5
Overall, we enjoyed our time spend in Cozumel and Iberostar and wish to return sometime in the future. Everyone in my family was able to find activities to enjoy. We found the facilities to be all we wanted for fun, relaxation, and quality time with family.;4
Loved the food. Everyone is friendly and accommodating. We loved our rooms! So cute! It was clean. I love that the hotel was eco friendly.  Manolo the yoga and Pilates instructor was amazing!! Very kind and professional!;5
"We liked the jungle like feel of the separate cabana like rooms and the hammock on each porch! We enjoyed all the animals on the resort (flamingos, peacocks, iguanas, coatis). The activities staff were amazing! Shout out to Alejandra who made all the games fun (pool volleyball, water aerobics, can jam, Pictionary, etc) The steakhouse was our favorite restaurant at the resort. It was delicious; we went two nights! The buffets had a good variety. We enjoyed the beach and swim up bar. I would recommend bringing water shoes for walking into ocean since it’s rocky. We were able to go snorkeling and parasailing by being picked up on the resort dock which was so convenient!";5
"So first of all, this was only my second holiday abroad. But this is by far setting the standard high!  Accomodation: 3.5/5  This was the weakest area of the holiday, but not for many reasons. The room, whilst clean and always topped up with towels, soft drinks, and beer, still had a few issues. My iron was not working, and the ironing board is pretty pathetic.  Also had issues with the toilet randomly deciding to not fill the tank, and the ceiling fan turning itself off.  Amenities: 4/5  The stuff you can do outside of planned activities is insane; plenty of bars including a swim up bar, a huge pool, a great (but rocky as hell) beach, and activities catered for all!  One point lost due to the absolutely ludicrous prices in the shop - especially for suncream!!  Entertainment:";5
We spent 8 days fully inclusive at this Wonderful resort Iberostar Cozumel from June14th to June 22nd. We went with our daughter ,son in law and 10 year old Grandaughter who live in Florida. They recommended it as they went there last year and loved it. We absolutely had the best holiday ever experienced and we have travelled World wide.  It was the best! Beautiful paradise. Flamingos, beautiful birds and tropical flowers and gardens . Peacocks roaming the gorgeous grounds. The choice of food was excellent.  Marvellous breakfast. lunch and dinner buffets. Also casual beach bars and food around beach and pool. Superb cocktails,lagers and wine.  Excellent service from all staff in restaurants and table service for drinks if preferred. 3 5 star (a-la- carte ) restaurants. Steak;5
Our day trip to Iberostar Cozumel was one for the books! We took a taxi from the Iberostar Tucan in Playa del Carmen to the ferry in Playa del Carmen. The cost $12 USD. The ferry cost for 2 round trip $56 USD. If you buy a round trip make sure to understand there are two ferry’s Winjet (orange) and Ultramar (yellow). The two ferry’s alternate. Make sure to know which ferry is leaving at which time.  Our arrival onto Cozumel was smooth. There are designated spot for taxis. We waited in line approximately 10 min. The cost of taxi from Ferry to Iberostar Cozumel was $30USD.   Once we arrived at the resort we signed in with a day pass. No cost. Just had to show our bracelets and driver license and sign our names to a document that we understood the rules and times allowed for our;5
I give it 5 stars because we had a wonderful experience. It has a friendly and casual vibe.  Angelo and Alejandra and the rest of the entertainment team were top notch! Fun games were played in the pool and the lobby. Don't  miss the Boogie Nights show! You can hang out at the pool all day or take a 15 minute taxi ride to downtown for shopping. Alberto's Glass Bottom Boat snorkeling tour was amazing. We will definitely  do that again.;5
Just returned from Cozumel where we booked a day pass for Iberostar. Gorgeous jungle setting leading up to the beautiful beach. Fantastic food, great pool and swim-up bar, and lots of fish for snorkeling. We plan to return for a longer stay.;5
I can't imagine a better resort situation.  3 - 6 rooms per building, short walk to a swim-up bar pool, food, entertainment, beach volleyball, and Dressel Divers right on the beach!  Outside of our room, we saw peacocks, small and large lizards, flamingos, macaws, and some local animals I've never seen before.  There is lush vegetation throughout.  Drinking water stations are scattered throughout the resort.  I really enjoyed my stay here!;5
My husband and I visited Iberostar for 8 days in June of 2022. We had a fantastic experience. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The wait staff was friendly and extremely attentive. The entertainment staff was AMAZING!! The nightly entertainment was fun & exciting, and we were very impressed with the staff’s professionalism and ability to keep everyone engaged and entertained. Big shout out to Alejandra, Edgar, Lenar & Angelo from the entertainment team, I don’t think our trip would’ve been as fun without them. We loved the daily aqua-aerobics classes offered in the pool- these were a daily must for us, especially given that this is an all-inclusive resort. The grounds, dining halls/restaurants and rooms were well maintained and clean. The resort offers;5
Great experience. We decided to come here to escape from the sargazo in Quintana Roo and it was a good decision. The resort is well maintained, the service and staff are great and rhe facilities always clean. The staff at the kids club were amazing and our 7 year old had lots of fun with them. The beach is really nice and amazing to snorkel, the rocks at the entrance are not a problem, bring water shoes and you will be fine.;5
Iberostar Cozumel is a fantastic resort in Cozumel. Great food, incredible staff, and close proximity to dive sites.  Gabriel, who helps bring in and out the catamarans and kayaks, was especially helpful.  Also, my wife and I got an upgraded room when we arrived free of charge!;5
Great resort. All the staff go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The entertainment staff is great at what they do. All the entertainment was very enjoyable. The grounds keeping is done constantly and very well maintained. Had no complaints with the room or house keeping.;5
This place was spectacular!! The views and beach were remarkable. The food wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t very good. Make sure to find what you like at the beginning of your stay and stick to that for the remainder. The star friends and staff are so friendly and the whole atmosphere is so welcoming. Lenar and Alejandra are the best star friends ever!!! And Salvador is the best excursion planner. The last thing to point out is how outstanding the snorkeling and scuba diving is!! I would definitely go back.;5
Trip was amazing, especially thanks to Lenar and Alejandra for making our trip awesome. Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting to have fun. Great community, lot of people from texas for some reason. Definitely try scuba diving;5
We visited Iberostar Cozumel for a week in June 2022.  We had been there several years ago and had a good experience.  This time around, it really seems like a lot about the resort has declined.  The rooms are extra musty, but that isn’t new and you are right on the water.  The majority of the hotel is open air🥵. 2 restaurants and the guest rooms are the only air conditioned spaces.  Most of the ceiling fans in the lobby and adjoining buffet restaurant were either not working, or not on.  It can get very hot. The ac in the room couldn’t keep up and it was very warm.  All the people in our party had the same issue in their rooms, and so, it wasn’t worth complaining as it seems all the rooms are the same.  The grounds are nice and the flamingos, peacocks, etc. add a nice touch.;3
Iberostar Cozumel ROCKS!!!! The staff is amazing, especially Angelo. He treated us like family!!!  The food was excellent. Entertainment was outstanding.   We will definitely be returning to Iberostar in the near future!!!;5
My family had an outstanding experience as always with great service from Manolo, Rogelio, Cindy, and Rosa. They have all gone out of their way to make connections with guests and offer great service to all.;5
Fantastic group of support staff Cindy, Manolo, Alejandro  We had a fantastic 7 day stay at the iberostar. This is our 4th trip to the resort and has become a yearly ritual now. Cindy is the best, she instantly recognized our group and provided the best breakfast and lunch experience pampering our needs.   Manolo our gym, yoga, Pilates expert has been helping me with stretching and my fitness goals. It’s awesome to be in his presence and learn from him.   Alejandro saw our group and pulled us in to play random games like Pictionary, karaoke etc and makes the lobby area fun and exciting  The only compliant I have about this place are the power outages. We experience atleast one if not two every year but we try to cruise through them.   This resort is truly paradise.;4
My husband and I were there for six nights and met amazing people there. Alejandra, in the entertainment team was amazing, a great attitude,  making everybody dance and participate in the activities in the pool. Cindy was another person in the restaurant as a waitress, she attended every need we had and was quick getting us what we needed. I was really impressed on how she not only was talking to us but everybody in the restaurant, she was full of life, your rarely see this type of service. We’ll definitely come back! I hope they get paid a fair wage. Good employees are hard to find.;5
Alejandra, Leonard, and Angelo made this stay feel like home in the best way, these employees were like friends by the end of the week! Every event was entertaining and all staff were amazing and polite.;5
Manolo the fitness instructor at Iberostar Cozumel, is very passionate about his job and helping others on their fitness journey. He is a wonderful motivator and encourages everyone to be active. His salsa class was amazing and we had a great time! This resort is lucky to have such an amazing instructor!;5
"The resort is beautiful with lots of wildlife present. The food was excellent and the entertainment is great.  Angelo, Leonar, and Edgar at the pool are fantastic with lots of fun activities available. P.S. Angelo is “so sexy”, his request for the review ;)";5
Angelo & Edgar& Leonard are great entertainers! Angelo's very funny & a good Aquafun trainer. He makes sure everyone's having fun & you'll get quite a WORKOUT I tell ya!!  Both Edgar & Angelo are great trainers.  Volleyball, archery, shooting, hockey, etc.. so many activities to choose from so make sure you stay for at least a week.  The star camp: Rosa, Karen, & Ismael are a great team too. Put your kids in the kid's club & go have a drink by the beach side or in the pool.. They keep your kids entertained with painting, tyes-dye t-shirts, beach volleyballs, kid's archery, & endless games. We put our older kid in there every single day. We enjoyed our stay @ Iberostar Cozumel & will be back next year!!;5
We had a fabulous 5 days at Iberostar.  The staff was over the top in terms of customer service.  They were very attentive, especially at the Star Camp Kids club including Rosa, Ishmael, and Karen.  They took care of the kids and made it so much fun with many activities...painting, water games, archery, ect. Kids need to be 4 to 12 yo but they will accommodate younger kids with parents.  If you have kids, I definitely recommended paying stop.;5
I just finished a Pilates class with Manolo and he is amazing! So kind, very knowledgeable and a fantastic teacher. I lucked out and was the only student this morning so I received some one on one instruction and he helped me correct my form. The setting is breath taking…I can’t imagine a better way to start the day than Pilates looking out at the Caribbean ocean. Please give Manolo’s class at the Iberostar on Cozumel a try-you will not be disappointed! It’s a perfect balance of a hard work out balanced with relaxing breath work and stretching:;5
Beautiful hotel & beach! Super friendly & talented staff! They work all day entertaining guests & then show their amazing talent at the evening shows! Wow! Way to go Edgar, Angelo, Alenjandra, Manila, Rosa.;5
The grounds and beach are beautiful. The staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, the food and drinks were good. The rooms were nice and clean. Some of the entertainment was good, some wasn’t. The resort is very laidback and relaxing. The staff all wore masks all the time, which for me is unnecessary. The water was a little murky in front of the resort, but still beautiful. The best snorkeling is a short boat or cab ride away. Sky Reef and Playa Corona both have good snorkeling from the shore and are only a 10 min. cab ride. They are free as long as you buy some food and drinks.;5
This resort is beautiful and I love how there are so many buildings as opposed to one large building with all the rooms in one area. It feels like you truly are in nature. The restaurants are really good, so make sure you make reservations! The staff really all went above and beyond and were all fabulous! The entertainment team is wonderful, especially Lenar, Alejandra, Angelo, Mary, Ismael and Karen. If you need help with dinner reservations Luis at the hospitality desk is a gem and Edgar at the pool bar is fantastic! Can't wait to go back. :);5
The grounds were well maintained and beautiful. It was like a jungle excursion. The  people at the dive shop and the entertainment crew were just amazing. Angelo and Alejandra were fantastic! They made the trip fun. We rented catamarans from the dive shop every day. We went on one diving trip as well. Our diving instructor was Lauren and she was amazing. We absolutely loved our diving experience. The rooms themselves were adequate but not impressive. The rooms had air conditioning but struggled to keep the room cool. We had three rooms rented for our family. My daughter’s room had some short in the electrical system and had zero power. They were forced to relocate her to a different room on the opposite side of the resort from the rest of the family. The pool chemicals turned my;3
"This was my first and last visit to this property. The property overall is not in the best of shape and poorly maintained. Ceiling fans were not working in the lobby, there were cats and birds in the restaurants and all the restaurants were very short handed. The staff were nice for the most part but tips were always expected and the service suffered especially at the bars.  The rooms - the rooms were sub par. The room we started in had missing sections of tile. I mean the whole tile floor was missing under both beds. It was bare concrete and had a smell to it. Please note this was an ""upgraded"" room. Thank goodness it was complimentary! We were moved to another room and it wasn't much better. The A/C unit had to be replaced while we were there. Also, we had to have our keys";3
We enjoyed our stay and met lots of great people! The staff was very welcoming and the entertainment was awesome. They have a very talented group of young entertainers that kept you busy with music shows, crafts, trivia and pool games. Kudos to Lenar, Alejandro and Angelo. Very beautiful people with great personalities. There is only a few things that I was disappointed in. The food I would give a 3 * because the food was bland, no coffee maker in the room and the room was very small compared to other all inclusive resorts that we have stayed at. The Scuba diving was great and you had to do lots of walking to get to the restaurants to eat at. We also had to have reservations at 3 of their main restaurants. I gave them 3 **** because of the friendliness of their staff! They could;4
We stayed at Iberostar as a family of four and enjoyed it. Got to see a lot of wildlife which was neat. Staff were friendly. Some of the servers were better than others. We were disappointed in the food and service at the Mexican restaurant there. Others were good. Just something to know…if you plan to use your coupons…Must have them with you!;4
This is our 5th visit to the resort. Overall it did not disappoint, the only reason for 4 not 5 stars is recurrent issues with our air conditioning. The last day of our trip trying to pack and get ready for travel I was sweating the entire morning. This made for a miserable end to our great trip and was worsened by a day of travel while already sweaty and drained. Otherwise we had a large group that met and stayed at the resort. The Steakhouse was fantastic, Oriental restaurant was pretty good, our friends booked the Mexican restaurant and said it was terrible, actually went to the buffet to eat immediately after. Thank goodness we skipped out on that one. The entertainment is amazing. They had a poolside fire show that wowed everyone! Angelo was an amazing entertainer and so;4
Great service, good food and awesome entertainment! This resort has bungalows that are spread out, it's like walking through the jungle to get to your room. The beach is nice and wide, swimming from shore is tough due to coral, but you can get in from the pier. Wear water shoes to walk in 200 yards to the south and drift snorkel to the pier. We saw starfish and stingrays everytime.. The staff are friendly, say hi to Cindy and Didier in the restaurant, some of our favorites.;5
Wonderful Experience!  Karen, Rosa, & Ismael we’re wonderful with the kids!  Great place!  Rooms were clean, food was ok, went snorkeling it was wonderful!  Chinese restaurant was good!  Alejandra and Angelo were wonderful entertainers! Would come back for sure!;5
The resort is beautiful! That’s the main plus. The food is not exceptional. Stick with the main buffet. The Mexican and steakhouse restaurants (reservations only) are not that great. I wouldn’t bother with them. In particular, the steaks were very poor cuts. All across the board the service is not acceptable. They don’t like to refill drinks, and when they do, they act put-out even when they are generously tipped. One evening we dined at the the buffet restaurant. Both of our drinks were empty for quite some time. When we finally got the waiter’s attention, we both asked for more iced tea, but the waiter only brought back one. There were not many diners at all as it was still pretty early, and it was fully staffed. Our waiter only had 2-3 tables with 4 or less at each one.;3
Great trip, facility, and fun.  Only issue is the sand flees on the beach between Iberostar and Albertos restaurant.  Otherwise no complaints at all.  Onsite dive operations Dressel Divers was also great.  Overall a great trip for the price.;5
I took morning yoga with Manolo while I was staying at Iberostar Cozumel. We were right on the beach, listening to the waves! I was super excited, and Manolo did not disappoint. His class was a nice combination of relaxing and challenging. I really appreciated how he said almost everything in English and Spanish! As someone who has forgotten most of the Spanish I previously learned, that was very impressive. He also works in the gym and teaches Zumba in the afternoon. He must be a busy man! I was so bummed I couldn’t join in Zumba, but I was leaving the day I took yoga. So glad I at least got to do yoga on the beach before leaving! Thank you Manolo!;5
Just love the Iberostar Cozumel! We stayed from May 31 to June7th 2019  for a family vacation and we did not regret it!   The open concept lobby is nice.  Grounds are beautiful and well maintained.  Close to the buffet and theater. Iberostar is recognized for their scenery and animal protection.  The gardens are beautiful and you can see different animal through the resort.    The little bungalows are a bit out of date and could use an upgrade.  The rooms are small but nice, clean and functional.  They could use an upgrade.  Don’t let this detail discourage you from going.  You only sleep in there anyway!  The mini bar is filled up everyday.   Food and drinks are very good.  You will find something you like for sure.  The buffet offers many different dishes every day.  At the;5
Breakfast and lunch server Cindy was the absolute BEST server ever! Our last day there was her day off and we definitely could see the difference. She was outstanding and we are so grateful we had her the other 5 days of our trip. Thank you Cindy!!;5
Wonderful holiday in the beautiful environment of a tropical jungle. Accomodation takes the form of brightly coloured circular huts with staw roofs and a private balcony. Excellent service. Humidity was a problem on our bathroom ceiling but it had rained heavily the first 3 days and the climate can be humid and heavy.  Diving with dressel divers was very enjoyable though it does run a bit like a factory. Special thanks to GEORGIA (Dressel Divers), with whom we made a day trip to Cenotte for cave diving. She was great company, knowledgeable, an excellent and patient instructor  If I weren't a diver, I would be disappointed with swimming in the ocean from the beach: rocks underfoot on the way in, quite a bit of seaweed, sandy water and very few fish. Thanks to MANOLO for his very;4
Excellent instruction with Manolo and he was very patient with helping me get back into yoga after surgery  I am looking forward to his dance classes  pjs you can catch him in the gym for help. Manolo is the best;5
Manolo is an amazing yoga instructor at the Iberostar Cozumel…yoga at the beach is very relaxing, meditative and healing.  You will also find him at the gym and is a personal trainer, Zumba and very helpful.;5
Absouletly fantastic!! This resort came highly recommended for its attention to details, the environment and having Dressel Divers on property. My husband and I got certified in January.  Each day we did a 2 tank  dive with Milly. Milly was exceptional!! She was always looking out for the divers to provide the best experience for everyone. The boat rides to our distinations were only 5 minutes. By the time we ce back from our mornings dives the houskeeping staff had already beem to our room and made our beds. Such a nice surprise each day.There were 3 speciality restaurants and a couple of buffets each day and the food was superb! Alejandra was the entertainment queen with Bingo, Corn Hole, and Pool aerobics,ect . Thanks for making our visit to Cozumel a special one and we will;5
My husband booked a last minute trip to scuba dive in Cozumel. We love Iberostar and Dressel Divers so Iberostar Cozumel was the obvious choice. Because it was a short trip the time to dive was limited to one morning (which was amazing, shout out to Santi!). The remainder of the trip was filled with constant run ins with Alejandra, a member of the entertainment crew. What an amazing young lady! She was engaging, personable, hilarious, and…of course…entertaining! Music trivia, bingo (sorry…Lotteria!!!), shooting rifles, and dancing in the pool, we had a fantastic and memorable trip!  Alejandra was able to wear many different hats in her role and filled each one seamlessly. We will continue to return to Iberostar resorts because of the outstanding team members like Alejandra and;5
Wverything was great, the games were great, and i got drunt asf . And games were fun. we were diving and the ocean it’s awesome ong the turtles are huge and the fish too. in alberto’s they have a pole and i really recommend the snapper . and i loved the entertainment team, alejandra wonderful.;5
Trough my visit at Iberostar Manolo was, for me, the greatest employee. He gave me tips with my training and gave one of the best customers service. When a meet him we were a the gym but he also gave us a great Zumba classes dans yoga class!  Mathieu;5
Loved our vacation here! The food is amazing and the views are incredible! Lots of great restaurants and buffet options. The entertainment staff is awesome—shoutout to Sofia and Angelo! Lots of activities and so much fun!;5
We really enjoy this resort but unfortunately this time it rained almost entire vaca. We had plenty of other fun options.     Really enjoyed the entertainment staff, especially Amber, Sofia,  Leonard, Daniel.;4
Very satisfied with the service. Special thanks to José Martin and his team.   The room, food, service was exceptionnel. I recommend Cozumel Iberostar to any famille out there. I will return to iberostar for my next trip !;5
This resort was perfect for our family would definitely go back in the future! The beach was amazing and the staff was perfect and welcoming. They felt like a second family and were super polite and helpful.;5
The service is wonderful and the grounds are kept beautifully clean. You’ll feel like you’re staying in a villa in the jungle with the hut style and bougie accommodations. Each room has an outdoor seating area with hammocks. The sounds of the several tropical birds chirping is perfect background noise for an outdoor nap. Seeing the random tropical birds and flamingos on the grounds was a beautiful and special touch.  GOOD FOOD: Aside from the good food in the main all inclusive dining room, there are also included delicious specialty restaurants. You DO have to make reservations for those specialty restaurants but do not have to pay extra. (Unless ballin out with a nice bottle of wine) house wine is included.   GOOD SERVICE: The wait staff is attentive and incredible. Fabian was;5
IBEROSTAR in Cozumel is a great place to stay! The staff is attentive and professional (especially Rosa, the towel girl).  The grounds are beautiful and the food is good, especially for an all inclusive resort.  They having a dive shop and lessons, great shows and other activities.  If you want to go someplace tropical and have a fun, relaxing vacation this is the place to come!;5
Even with much rain,my heart is full of sunshine! Indeed,I am feeling grateful  to have vacation here. From the waiters to entertainment teams for kids and adults as well, everyone and everything contributed to a warm, happy and filled of 'wonderfuls' family moments! A special shout to the show singers and dancers, who made us sing and dance together as one, Sofia and Angelo for their contagious happiness, Manolo my fellow Yogi and Lenar my newly found souls friends. May you all be blessed exponentially with endless success, happiness, health love and Light always @ICbyIlanit;5
Fantastic activities all day - i especially loved Manolo leading yoga, Zumba, and the fitness room! He was always so encouraging and a marvelous teacher! We also enjoyed the nightly entertainment which included an amazing cast of dancers, singers, and emcees. Special shout-out to Angelo and Alejandra, they were awesome! If you're looking for a family friendly destination that is full of entertainment and activity options, this is your place!;5
Loved the hotel. Scuba dives were great. Wonderful yoga session with Manolo. The entertainment people are amazing. Sophie, Alejandra and all. All you can eat is really all you can eat and drink!!!! Rooms are clean and comfortable. Varied restaurants;5
We really enjoy our stay at this eco responsible resort every thing was made in respect for the environment. We particularly enjoy having acces on the site to a verry good diving company (dressel diver). All the personal was happy and helpful. The service was great they pass by your chair at the beach to see if you need any drink, the resort was clean and the garden around the site is beautiful lot of animal here. Flamingo,parrots, frog, coati, agouti even wild pig . All the small house all around make you feel like you are part of a small village. The room are clean and have any thing you need except a coffee maker. This resort is calm and serene. The food is very good we enjoy all the restaurants they have verry good steak at the steak house and the cooking methods are;5
This was a great 15 day vacation. From checking in With the great hotel staff and porters, Yemi the concierge, the bartenders Geovani, Adrian, Eli, Cindy all of them were terrific — the cooks were spectacular, Fidel was superb, Cindy, Hector, Theresa,Judith and so many more helping us to our seats and serving us. The entertainment people Edgar,Angelo, Allahandra, Sofia, Lenar, these young adults entertained us all day long and into the evening.. they all have such talent….and the Star Camp people ..Ismael, Rosemary, Karen they were superb with all the kids of all ages… the singers were great also Amber & Daniell👍🎶.  Allahandra the dancer and May the choreographer.. all the massuesses in the spa have MAGIC HANDS..Manolo in the gym and yoga and dance lessons👍  Vladimir and;5
10/10 great resort with great entertainment Alejandra was a great host for games and entertainment who made everything exciting and fun. Would definitely recommend this resort if you want to relax drink listen to music and just enjoy a relaxing experience;5
Nice resort for a simple vacation. Location is perfect away from the hustle and bustle of the city, food choices was great, beach access was great. My only complaint was the power went out for about 5 seconds which triggered the AC unit so there was no AC in the rooms overnight for that day, it was humid and hot I don’t think anyone at the resort got test that night.;5
We spent our 20th anniversary here and absolutely loved it.  All of the staff was kind and helpful (even helping us with our Spanish).  Sofia and Alejandra were so fun with the games and entertainment.  The food was very good at the Asian restaurant and the buffet but we were less impressed with the steak house and Mexican restaurants.  Our room (8314)  was the suite overlooking the pool and ocean.  It was well worth the upgrade.  The grounds are super well maintained.  The SCUBA with the on-sight Dressel Divers was spectacular (thanks Hector and Ceci).  We worked out everyday at the gym and it was clean and had everything we needed.  We would definitely recommend Iberostar Cozumel and we hope to come back.;5
Wonderful resort. Kind and friendly staff, clean, clean, clean. Great food selection. Many activities offered. We now see why so many come back year after year. There are great tours and transportation options also.;5
This place was pretty amazing. The food was good, the alcohol was bountiful, but the biggest impact was the amazing entertainment. The team was full of energy every day all day and made my experience great for the second time. I came to this hotel last year around this time and recognized some faces from the previous trip as well as some new ones. Let me just say Angelo, Sofia, and Alejandra were some of the best entertainers I could ask for! I participated in almost every game so it would be hard to say exactly what games I loved with them, but volleyball and watching them in the show every night was such a blast. By the end of my short week there they all felt like family. Could not ask more from the entertainment team!;5
Sofia,  Lamar, Angelo and Alejandra  made this trip to Cozumel Iberostar Amazing!!!!They made this trip so wonderful .. I hope they are here when I come back they are friendly and delightful and hope to see them again 👍!!;5
"This resort is a tad on the older side and in need of some cosmetic repairs. When we got to the room the bathroom mirror was sitting atop the faucet (we called and it was fixed that day). The porch chair was broken, the mattress springs ""boinged"". The beach & pool cabanas have signs that say ""NO reserving cabanas"" but it is not enforced. By 7am there are towels on every cabana chair and most of them will not be occupied until well into the afternoon. This however I blame on the rudeness of the tourists and not the staff. The beach is so rocky getting into the ocean is almost impossible for anyone (especially the elderly). Masks are mandatory especially in the restaurants but is only enforced sparodically. Americans seem to be the ones resisting wearing one (go figure). The food";3
I LOVE ANGELO. The entire resort is super nice and very friendly no matter where you are. The burgers are kind of bad but it is super nice and welcomes anyone and is perfect for every kind of trip or vacation. The gym is amazing! Alejandra is very nice and brings fun times to every event.;4
The ambiance of the resort is awesome! The food at all of the inclusive buffets and restaurants are very good and my favorite part of the experience was definitely the large selection of activities and performances in the the theater and the lobby! We especially loved Alejandra, Angelo, and Daniel!!;5
"We have been coming to Iberostar Cozumel (couple 53 & 48 this year) at least twice a year for the last 8 years. It is about as far south as you can get on the west side and that is what we like... to get away from all the tourists. Does it have 5 star food? Well, that depends upon how hungry you are. The food is good, but the location and staff are excellent. We came here because it was close to the dive sites without a long boat ride. We kept coming back because of the people and the entertainment. I no longer dive, but we come to see ""the friends"" and the beach/water. We have stayed at 4 other places closer to town and we always return to Iberostar. The genuinely nice staff want to help you have a good time on your vacation. Angelo, Edgar and Ismael have really become our";5
We decided at the last minute to take a short vacation for our anniversary 4 nights 5 days. We were exhausted upon arrival and ended up falling asleep in our nice cold room for the rest of the day. The next day we went out on a deep sea fishing charter. When we arrived back to our room we found the room door wide open. I have no idea how long it had been open. Im guessing it was left open by housekeeping I have no idea. Nothing was missing and the front desk didn’t seem concerned when I called to notify them.   The beach/water as others have mentioned is very rocky. We wanted to snorkel but just ended up missing out as we only had a few days it was very windy with poor water visibility.   Now the food. They do have much more to choose from than another resort that  we have;2
We spent 5 nights here and overall this is a great resort.    The entertainment team led by Edgar was amazing.   Shout out to Alejandra, Lenar, Sophia and Angelo for having a great attitude and doing their very best to keep everyone involved !!!   The nightly entertainment was exceptional.   Food was on par for all inclusive.   Our favorite was the La Pagoda (Asian influence).     Room was good and the AC was awesome.  The beach is probably the only drawback as there are lots of rocks which makes getting in and out of the water difficult.    Again, the entertainment team offset any negatives as they were the star of the resort!!!!   Lots of wildlife throughout the resort which is fun to see as well.  Would regally like to give a 4.5 stars but had to give 4 for the beach.;4
We love this resort. We are here now, sadly we will leave tomorrow. The people make this resort amazing. The Star Friends, Sofia, Alejandra and Angelo and Edgar are so great!! Spent the whole week really enjoying them!! Ana is always so friendly and always serving cocktails with a smile! The people have become like familia. The property is absolutely stunning. I will be so sad to leave, but we will definitely be back for our third visit.;5
The entertainment team made our stay great. They has so many fun things to do and were all hilarious and good people. Specifically, Alexandra and Lenar made our days at the resort memorable. They both went out of their way to talk to us and learn more about our family.;4
We travelled all the way from the uk on an 11hour flight and it did not disappoint. The staff who Re at the resort are some of the best people I have ever met.  They are kind  fun, caring and yo wayyyy above and beyond to make sure everyone on their holidays have the nest time. So many daily activities and the shows are amazing. They have everything from the rock show which is the best noght packed with live band rock music, to boogie night, karaoke and so .uxh more. They also do bingo nights, and In the day , there are so many rleaxing activities, tote painting, dreamcatcher and bracelet making. Special shout outs to angelo (he is just gorgeous inside and out) alejandra and Sofia for being so beautiful, helpful and entertaining. Sofias growls were legendary! They were our;5
Rosa, Ismael and Karen made our vacation truly special.  Kids club / star camp and the family activities were awesome.  They made our girls Denver 7 & Arrow 4 feel special and always included. Our children ask to return to Ibostar for star camp .;5
The entertainment team is amazing they make you feel welcomed and are super friendly. The team makes sure everyone is included in all the activities and is comfortable and having fun. Alejandra is very friendly and makes everything super fun! Edgar is an amazing dancer and makes personal connections with all the guest. Angelo is the life of the party and is a super fun person. Sofia is very kind and is the best water aerobics instructor. Lenard is super sweet and makes the Iberostar experience even better for the guest.;5
Morning yoga with Manolo was such a peaceful way to start my morning! Manolo did a great job at leading a bilingual class. And the view and breeze of the ocean was perfect. I highly recommend this experience!;4
I had an amazing time staying at this resort. This was my second time to stay here. The food is great and the service at the bars and restaurant was excellent. The star friends, specifically Alejandra, were incredible and so entertaining. She did a great job putting on shows for us and doing different activities. I highly recommend staying here!;5
Alejandra was so amazing and made us feel right at home. Her and her star friends crew made the trip so much better. The buffet is great and the wildlife makes you feel like you’re in a jungle. 10/10 would recommend, and I can’t wait to come back!;5
Went to Yoga class with Manolo at iberostar in the morning. The class was super good, Relaxing and very good teacher. The view was super nice and felt great. I recommend his class as it was amazing. Thank you;5
"We spent wonderful 10 days at the Iberostar Cozumel resort.  We were welcomed promptly upon our arrival.  The property is beautiful.  Very well maintained.  Our room was well appointed with a stocked mini fridge (pop/beer), A/C, walk-in rain shower.   Coffeemaker in the room would have been nice, but with them trying to be environmentally friendly,  I could understand why there isn't one.  Maybe having a coffee station available at the ""Steakhouse"" location (as it is more centrally available than the lobby buffet restaurant) could be an option. I did appreciate the adjustable magnifying mirror (something I wish other hotel chains had).  Hubby loved the hammock on the balcony.  The food at the buffet restaurant was very good and there was something for everyone.  As for the";5
Just returned from a week long stay. Can you say fun?! The entire entertainment staff is on their game! Miss Sophia, Rosa, Alejandra, Karen, Angelo,Ismael and Lenar ( I apologize for those who’s names I forgot because every single one of them deserves to be recognized )  made my trip unforgettable! I highly recommend participating in the adult pool activities and poolside arts & crafts. Miss Sophia & Angelo gave me a fun workout with water aerobics, I made a bracelet and painted a tote bag. By participating in activities all of the entertainment staff got to know me and were calling me by my first name. I was impressed! I truly felt like I was home with all my new friends. I also became friends with Mr. Fabian, one of the head waiters who was very attentive to all our needs.;4
"I visited the resort on the week of the 16th of May with my family. The 8 of us had an amazing time. The entire entertainment team was super polite and hard working. Sofia, Alejandra, Angelo, Ambar and the rest of the team made our stay super fun with well prepared activities. There are high quality  music shows on the evenings; the musicians, singers and dancers blew our mind. Didn't expected to see such good quality show at the hotel.   The resort is very clean - special thanks to Alan who cleaned our room and each time was pristine.  Food was very good, and buffet has a lot of options - special shout out to Margarita  who was very kind in preparing special eggs every morning. Service at the restaurants and bars is also really good -  Wilvert and Adolfo where our regular";5
Alejandra and Sofia made our stay the best!!  They make the entertainment absolutely the best, fun and so entertaining. With the dive center right on site, made it so easy to dive in one of the the most beautiful parts of the world. I saw sea turtles, stingrays, and eels. Thank you Iberostar.;5
I had a really nice trip!! Entertainment team was really fun, great activistes!!! Special shout out to Alejandra, she was so great! And the rock show was literal fire, it was so great. The drinks were good and the food was delicious!!!!;5
We had a blast! The resort was beautiful and every single employee was top notch! The entertainment staff made every evening so much fun, especially Alejandra and Sofia. They had us in stitches every night! There were so many food options and we always found something we enjoyed. I loved having water stations around the property, too!;5
This review is specifically for the Oriental restaurant at this resort. They went out of their way to make my birthday memorable. The food was excellent and the main course, Salmon, prepared br Chef Jose was impeccably done. Our waiter, David, was very attentive. Omar the headwaiter made it all special by bringing me cake with a candle and they all sang Happy Birthday. Such a great experience. Thank you!;5
I visited with my husband the week of the 16th of May. I have to say the experience blew my expectations. The entire team was super polite, friendly, helpful and fun. Big shout out to the entertainment crew Sofia, Alejandra, Angelo, Lenar, Ismael and Rosa. All of them Made our stay super fun. I don’t have the names of the people who cleaned my room (6104) but I must say they did an excellent job, everyday the room was pristine.  The food was very good and the omelettes every morning were delicious!  I also took the Discovery Scuba experience, it was the best decision, thank you to instructors: Omar, Hector and to Acatzin who gave us the first intro in the pool.  Looking forward to my next visit!!;5
We traveled to Cozumel to celebrate some big milestones and chose Iberostar Cozumel because it was well priced, had good reviews and looked relaxing! We stayed in a Cancun resort last year and this was hands down a better experience. The resort is beautiful and feels like you’re in a rainforest. There is so much nature and wild life: flamingos, parrots, peacocks and coatis everywhere!  The food is some of the best we’ve had at an all inclusive resort, but you shouldn’t expect fine dining. The rooms are just what you need for resting after a long day in the sun, but nothing extravagant. The entertainment team makes sure there are fun events if you want to engage in something other than sunbathing and swimming. One of the many highlights of this trip is when the entire pool joined;5
First of all, Sofia from entertainment  was absolutely amazing and made our trip excellent. Reyes, Raymundo who were the bartenders went above and beyond serving us drinks and making us feel welcome. The wildlife was incredible around the hotel but we felt at home the entire time. These people were the sole reason we are going to come back again soon. I hope this resort appreciates all their collective efforts because they above and beyond the entire time. 10/10 by far this resort was beautiful and the events were so much fun. Can’t wait to come back for my next trip!!!;5
Came to this resort and had an absolute blast ! The beach and pool are amazing , the food was so so good , the entertainment staff Sophia specifically was amazing !!! She was so involved with everything had a smile and a fist bump each time we saw her ! Reyes and Reymundo are the best bar tenders I’ve ever had at a resort always had a drink ready before i even ordered it , i would def come back to this place;5
Love all the wildlife and tropical plantings in this place.  The food generally  good we particularly the tortilla soup at the Tex-Mex joint and most desserts were very good. Scuba diving was well run and friendly, but a bit over crowded at times.  Don't get a room too close to the dive shop unless you don't mind the late night music from the rowdy bar next door.  The only issue we had was from the vacationers.  Yes it's all inclusive, but if your wealthy enough to be there then you certainly can leave a few bucks regularly for all these hardworking underpaid nice folks they're just trying to earn a meager living!;4
Well...I went on reviews so let me give an accurate one- Good and bad. The good part- we are divers and Scuba Tony was able to pick us up at the dock in front of this resort. Dresses divers are cattle boats with way to many people for our comfort if you like smaller 6 person boats like us. This is our 6th time to Cozumel, stayed many places, this place we will not visit again. Flamingos and birds were nice, grounds are kept well. Pool is filthy. Black in tiles sides full of soap scum, sunscreen scum, some kinda scum. Eww. Food is average for all inclusive..no AC  anywhere but your room. And you cannot adjust it cooler. No coffeemakers no roomservice. Nice way to long walk at 6am to get a small cup and drink it in 90 degree weather. Bring a cup with you to fill!  Chinzy pool;2
We have stayed in at least 25-30 different all inclusive resorts in Mexico, and this one jumped to the top of the list almost immediately and we nearly cried when it was time to check out!      Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum are just overrun with seaweed for about 9 months of the year now and something made me wonder if Cozumel might be a better bet for beautiful, clear, swimmable water. The answer is yes! I started looking at west facing resorts south of town. I had never stayed at an Iberostar hotel before, but the little huts and jungle like grounds appealed, so I booked it and hoped for the best. Check in was fast and easy and NO TIMESHARE PEOPLE trying to give you a tour!!!!     We have already decided to go back in February. The landscaping is absolutely beautiful and;5
This resort is wonderful and was a perfect place for to spend vacation with my family. Wonderful pool, amazing beach and the staff is out of this world! We tried out the Star Club (for kids) when my kiddos wanted to do their Treasure Hunt and went back the next day to do a sand castle competition. Ismael, Karen and Rosa from the Star Club made the time for my kids so fun!! They LOVED it and had such a great time!!! Thank you to the whole staff!;5
"7th time here and have trip planned for  October 2022;  Will not belabor points well covered;  tropical junglesque, wildlife, rocky beach etc.  will add tips and kudos. Good food,  could have more greens,.  Deserts good.  Fruit very good,  all 3 melons represented  and pineapple good.  Better than at home.  Not very good about re-stocking fruit and the good ice cream if you dine later, after 8 : 30. For breakfast and dinner. If going to steakhouse, do not expect real good steaks.  Filet Mignon a better choice than ribeye, but the salmon and chicken skewers are very good.  Corn soup (corn cream) highly recommended.  Do not expect Ruth’s Chris quality, but it is a fun experience.  No extra charge for the usually great sunsets that can be seen at steak house dinner.   If you like";3
"My wife, my two adult daughters and I just returned from a fabulous four night stay at the Iberostar Cozumel and were quite impressed by everything. We came for our best friends' wedding; they had been here multiple times so we're worried we'd be underwhelmed but far from it. Best part was the people: Giovanni, making the best cocktails, Fidel the head waiter at the steakhouse, and Roberto the GM who took care of some minor issues we had with excellent customer service. Here's the pros & some tips: Pros: - The resort is beautiful, lots of natural wildlife, birds, coatis and great floral. Very laid back resort, not near other resorts which is nice for walking the beach in both directions. Plenty of shady loungers, although lots of people claim chairs, we never had a problem";5
The steak house has terrible steaks. Everything else was a blast and will sure be going back. The facilities are very nice and the drinks are perfect. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The wildlife was awesome.;4
Relaxing, beautiful, clean, friendly.. I loved this place the food and service were excellent .. nice place for family vacation.. we will definitely return. Rooms and grounds were clean and beautifully manicured.;5
Awesome experience.  Loved the service and all the entertainers.  Sofia, Alehandra, Angelo, and Edgar really involved the crowd and we had fun playing and getting to everyone.  The steak house was the best of the trip.  I am allergic to carrots and found them in all the restraunts.;5
We painted bags today... the entertainment and activities dept is so good. Varied fun things to do for all ages.  Group of girls, some divers, some gym girls. We have had a great vacation. Rooms are great, service excellent, restaraunts have a great variety for everyone;5
Selection of food really needs help. Got the impression that the hotel was short staffed. The steak restaurant was below par and service was poor even though reservations were always maxed out but really only about 40% occupied. Overall for the cost the Iberostar is a good place.;3
Absolutely wonderful experience from beginning to end!  The staff was friendly, helpful and worked their butts off!!!  The entertainment staff was excellent, Angelo was perfection! Fredy,  Giovanni and the other hard working bartenders are top notch! Exquisite, lush grounds give you a jungle theme, with exotic wild life through out! We cannot wait to go back!!!!;5
We had good time here. The food is really good but my best place was the Oriental a la carte restaurant. My best activities was with Manolo!!! He is the gym trainer, he gave us yoga class and zumba dance. I did 2 dive with Dresdell  and it was ok. The t’rock band show was a blast!!! Yes, I would come back at this resort!;5
Outstanding service and accommodations! Many thanks to Ismael, Rosa, Angelo, Lenar, Alejandra, and Manolo for making my stay Heaven in earth… can hardly wait to return!  The food was so good with many selections to choose from.;5
Manolo is great since he helps me with my Spanish. He also helps me with my form on bench press. I help him with his English a little bit but he is great to speak Spanish with. He is very nice as well.;5
Had a wonderful trip! The resort is clean. It’s nice that each room has it’s own personal entrance. All the staff was friendly and helpful. A special thank you to the entertainment team (Lenar, Angelo, Alejandra, Sofia and Edgar), they work very hard!! Strongly recommend this hotel if your planning on staying in Cozumel! :-);4
Just returned from a week in paradise at Iberostar! If you are looking for brand new sterile environment than this is not for you, but if you want tranquil beautiful jungle grounds with birds chirping everywhere and a welcoming feeling where the entertainment crew will know you by name by the end than this is your place!   Kids did Star Camp multiple days, and while they were the only kids there our week Ishmael, Rosa, and Karen made sure they had the most fun with different games and activities each day.   For adults the drinks were not watered down, usually quite quick at the bar and also servers walking around everywhere taking orders. The entertainment crew were amazing - please take Angelo’s water exercise class! Sophia was new but you would never know it, the kids cried to;5
"This is a beautiful and well-designed resort! The rooms are comfortable and clean and bright. The grounds and pools are lovely and expansive. And the staff is outstanding--extremely friendly, helpful, and efficient. The food is delicious and tremendously varied, and while I enjoy the flexibility of buffet style, I do wonder at the safety of it as two of the four of our party got very sick from (different) food they ate. A few other suggestions for improvement: let your guests have some control over the A/C in their rooms; add more palapas for shade, since--despite your signage--everyone claims their spots for the day by 7am every morning; love the steps from the dock into the ocean, but the dock itself is a tripping hazard and could use an upgrade so it's more even.";4
We are just finishing a wonderful week at the Iberostar Cozumel. The property was meticulously maintained. The staff is very attentive. Our room was extremely clean every day. The diving operation is first class. We participated in fun activities, enjoyed the pool and the beach. Note that you need water shoes to access the ocean from the beach front, otherwise you can use the stairs from the pier, due to the shore being rocky. Lots of fish congregate in the morning under the pier if you like to snorkel. The property was not totally full which allowed everybody to find chairs at the pool or at the beach. The covid test included in the reservation was an antigen test administered on site the day prior to departure, which was very practical.  For my strict gluten-free diet;5
Great location for scuba diving. Boat trips are short and breaks are back on the island between dives. However with that, it’s popular so larger trips and less one-on-one dive experience. Aside from that room was in good shape but could use some updating here and there. Every ice machine was broken, constantly had to go to the bar for ice and water. Alberto’s was extremely loud at night which made sitting on our porch unenjoyable then. No option for room service or take away food, so we just carried plates back and forth. Overall good trip just could use some changes like to-go options and better ice machines.;3
This was our second time here.  It is clean and the food is good.  The entertainment staff is wonderful.  Alejandra and Ishmael are especially friendly and helpful.  Edgar and Angelo are incredibly talented.  We traveled with two other couples and we all had a great time.;5
Manolo was amazing for me and my family. From sunset yoga to instructions in the gym he was helpful and smiling every day. Thank you Manolo, from the bottoms of our hearts. What a wonderful sunny vacation.;5
Food is hit-and-miss, but there's variety, and the tropical fruits are superb (papaya, mango, pineapple, honeydew -- what you get up north doesn't do them justice).  Grounds are beautiful and well-kept.  Cute units.  Flamingos are endlessly entertaining.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Centrally located for SCUBA diving sites but far from town.  Dive shop on site.  Not rowdy.  Loud AC.    People, don't get burned to a crisp under the tropical sun -- take it in small doses or cover up.  I've seen lots of scary fuchsia-colored people here.;4
Awesome resort! Had an amazing time as a young couple. All of the staff was very friendly and worked so hard to keep the resort clean. Was a quiet resort, but still had countless opportunities to get involved in activities. All of the entertainment team was amazing (especially in the shows) but Sofia, Alejandra, and Lenar were exceptional. They took the time to get to know you and were always saying hello! Mexican and Steakhouse was amazing, no issues getting reservations. Buffet dinner was also good. The snorkelling at the beach was decent, but more to see by taking an excursion to the various reefs. Overall, would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking for a fun vacation! Once again, thank you to the entertainment team for truly making our trip special.;5
Nice all inclusive resort. Food was good. Entire staff is so hard working  friendly, helpful and always taking care to ensure the happiness of the guests. The resort is clean and the grounds well maintained. We would definitely go back.;5
"Wonderful experience at a well-organized and run all-inclusive on Cozumel - highly recommended for everyone. The whole five-night stay worked out fabulously on all fronts: terrific set-up of a well-managed eco-friendly property with beautiful ""real"" nature all-around, clean and well-maintained facilities, high-quality and great variety of food, the well-designed room with its balcony and hammock was just perfect - I even saw fireflies in the evenings. Dressel Divers turned out to be a great experience: flexible, willing to adjust to individual needs, and professional, we had an especially great experience with the manager, Nazareno Ovando, as well as the snorkeling excursion lead, Matias Ovando, and the diving instructor, Héctor. Bravo to everybody at Iberostar Cozumel for";5
I think this resort is phenomenal, everyone and everything is very friendly. The shows that are performed are very entertaining and cool. Edgar, Angelo, Alejandra, Ismeal, Sofia, Karen, Rosa. I like the steak house restaurant because the food is great. I would 100% come back anytime!;5
Everything has been great. A large complex, with many things to do. A great place to recharge. In particular I’ve enjoyed the gym, where Manolo has proven a competent and excellent professional. If you go to the gym, look for him!;5
The people, customer service, and everything in general is just fantastic. The food is also very good, especially the burger shack lol. They have activities every day so you never get bored, and they are very fun. The shows are entertaining and funny. The entertainment team: Angelo, Lenar, Sofia, Alejandra, Edgar, Ishmael, Karen, Rosa, and Gabriel are amazing people and the star camp, which is run by them, is amazing for kids ages 4-12.;5
This place is amazing! This is our 4th time here, we love all the staff! They treat you as if you are part of their familia. Alejandra, is so much fun and such a beautiful friendly person. Sophia is such a wonderful person as well, she is amazing at engaging everyone! They have truly become our friends !  Iberostar is so lucky to have a staff that represents them in such a positive manner.  They will always be a part of our memories. We cannot wait to see them next year🇲🇽❤️.;5
Had an amazing time! Beautiful resort with the best amenities. The staff was exceptional. Freddy, Giovanni, and Anna made the best drinks, Lenar, Giovanni, and Alexandra were beyond creative leading us into volleyball, pool exercise, daily games, and even theatre. We made a new amazing group of friends. We will definitely be back! Thanks for the memorable stay my friends!;5
My husband and I are nearing the end of our second trip to Iberostar. We really enjoy coming here! The environment and vibe is more laid back which is exactly what we look for.   Drinks are good! Rimando and Geovanni at the poor bar are great! They have introduced me to new drinks and are very good.   Entertainment is fun! You are always invited to participate but never feel bad for just watching. Alejandra, Sonja, Angelo, and Leonard are fun! They remember us day to day and come around and chat and invite you to activities. They perform at night too and I love the night shows.   This time I did the free scuba trial with Antonio. He was very patient, kind, and answered my questions!   Our room is always so clean and they get us whatever we need.   The food is good. It’s not;5
Had a great time all the staff was wonderful.highly recommend. The resort is super easy to navigate. It’s a must to make the reservation to go to the steakhouse for dinner. Beef tips were the best I ever had.👍👍👍🇲🇽;5
Every thing about this place is wonderful! Angelo, Alexandra, Sofia is the sweetest, funnest ever! They make us feel like we are family! They are the reason why I want to come back every time! The waiters, bartenders, cleaning staff… absolutely superb!!!;5
The best time. The staff was super nice and always helpful. The entertainment was amazing.  Can't wait to come back. The food was amazing.  Looking forward to coming back again really soon. I love the pools and the quick access to food and drinks.;5
We were at the Iberostar Cozumel April 19-26, 2022.  We stayed in a  standard room.  We have no complaints whatsoever.  None! Room spottless, gorgeous tiled bathroom.  Excellent housekeeping.  Comfy bed.  Food at resort plentiful and delicious.  Buffet always looked after.  Cold foods ice cold, hot food hot!  Interesting selection of specialty items ie infused drinks, fancy little prepared salads etc.  Both buffet dining rooms are so elegant,  Open-air, comfy chairs, excellent staff.  Pools absolutely spotless,  Perfect temp.  Drinks at all bars delicious.  Beach is lovely but not really swimmable due to rocks.  Simply walk out on the dock to the steps on the left hand side and jump in and enjoy the warm sea!!  Entertainment great.  This is a jungle-like resort with beautiful;5
Just wow. We had a wonderful time here.  The diving, food, ambiance, and entertainment all exceeded our expectations.  If you come here you need to dive or snorkel, don’t miss breakfast or any other meal really, and make sure to do all of Alexandria’s activities like pool volleyball and water aerobics.  It was all so much fun!! I read in previous reviews about poor customer service but I dont see how that was possible at all.  I was very satisfied with the entire staff.  They are wonderful and will make your stay a pleasure!;5
We stayed for 7 days but we should have stayed for 10 days. What an amazing place to relax and be pampered! Everyone we met was so kind and helpful. We especially loved Sophia the entertainer and Alessandra the waitress. Also there are many poke stops to spin if you're worried about that!;5
To summarize our time at the Iberostar in Cozumel in one word would be “astounding”! The food, music, activities, friendly staff and, nightly entertainment made us wish we had booked for 10 days instead of only 7. The days have passed by so fast and we are already planning to return. A special thank you has to go out to Sofia with the entertainment staff for making our stay so memorable!;5
Our visit was amazing it was my 1st trip and my inlaws have been here numerous times. The whole facility is amazing and the food was pretty good with lots of variety everyday. Sophia was super pleasant and entertaining everytime we saw her we just adore her!;5
We came back one year later and it is great to see our friends that we made from the first trip. Entertainment Team is fantastic!  Sofie is new  to the star friends and she is great with the guest.  The bartenders at The Prestige Club  (Reyes, Glendy, Argley) have been Fantastic!  We love being The Club Members thank you to our concierges  Yuremi and Raul.;5
This was our second stay.  We were here in May of 2021 and had to return.  It’s small but friendly.  The food is exceptional!  One of the Star Friends, Sophia was great.  It was her first week and she went out of her way to make us enjoy our stay.  So far we’ve eaten at all 3 specialty restaurants and they are all delicious.   Japanese was our favorite.;5
"My fiance and I had not taken a vacation in 4 years and - wow - we are thrilled we stayed at the Iberostar. While the property is beautiful, the snorkeling is thrilling, and the food is delicious, the most beautiful piece of the experience was the staff. Coach Manolo - thank you for the amazing workout sessions and yoga classes (+ the Spanish lessons)! Lenar, we hope you keep loving your new ""office"" by the beach. Cesar from Alamo, thank you for the simplest rental car experience. And, last but far from least, Milton - thank you for the Scooby Doo! If you are lucky enough to come to the Iberostar, please take some time to meet these unsung heroes. They will make your trip - I promise.";5
We had an amazing time, it was an incredible trip. The ocean is great, the food is truly phenomenal. Glendy, Rubie, Alicia were the best waitresses, Armando the bartender and Sofia’s entertainment made our trip!!!! Armando and Glendy picked us up after work while we were walking toward a concert. The rooms were amazing, a very private feel!;5
It was my wife’s and I first time visiting Mexico and we couldn’t have picked a better resort! The entire entertainment staff was amazing (Edgar, Angelo, Sofia, Alejandra, and Lenar). Geovani at the pool bar slayed making our drinks and the food was phenomenal. You won’t be disappointed booking this resort. Such a beautiful place.;5
The resort and location are beautiful, but it’s the amazing staff that make this location great.  Sofia is so much fun and has been such a wonderful person to get to know !! We did archery with her, had a ridiculously fun time at the couples competition, almost won at bingo, in addition to the trivia, and games in the pool!   She is friendly and caring and just such a great asset for the resort!  She always has a smile and takes the time to see how you are doing.    I wish the resort had more dairy free/vegan options for breakfast and desserts but I understand how that can be difficult!  The food overall has been very good and well labeled for allergies.  🏖❤️;5
Super great personality and everywhere we looked she was there to help and entertain ! We sill be back for sure. This resort is the best I have seen. Gardens, wildlife,diving etc..  the food is fresh and tasty. Night shows and bar staff is five. Star plus;5
Sofia gave us awesome experience!  We had a great time learning how to do archery.  All of the staff is amazing.  Lots of good times at the swim up bar and diving is great. Thanks to everyone that that made our experience so good.  Will likely be back.;5
We've been on many all-inclusive vacations, so we weren't expecting too much.  Iberostar Cozumel is on a totally different level - the best vacation experience we've had!  I've stayed at other hotels in Cozumel but in the future, I will only stay at Iberostar Cozumel.  All staff were very friendly - always greeted us and asked if there was anything they could do.  The food was fantastic - a wide variety and very delicious.  Rooms were clean and quiet.  Grounds were well groomed.  There were so many activities that there was no desire for us to leave the compound.  The dive shop provided excellent service.  Evening entertainment was far above the usual.  Every evening different and of very good quality - we enjoyed every performance.  I want to point out two outstanding people -;5
I very much enjoyed this resort. The staff members are all friendly and attentive. The food quality and selections were amazing. The grounds are all perfectly manicured gardens. Everything is kept up very well and cleaned constantly. The pool areas are very clean with clear water. I especially enjoyed the entertainment. I was not even expecting entertainment so it was a very pleasant surprise. Lenar, Sofía, Alejandra, Edgar, Alexa, Daniel, Ambar and Angelo, they were all so much fun. Everyone in my group really enjoyed watching these young entertainers and participating in the activities.;5
Hands down the best vacation I’ve been on! The resort is beautiful, the food is amazing, and they have the ultimate staff! Sophia was our favorite, so personable, funny, and genuine. We did rent a scooter and went around the island(highly recommend, it’s beautiful), but they have so many options of things to do that there was no need to leave the resort if you didn’t want to. No matter where you were at you saw everyone enjoying themselves. I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else for vacation!;5
Uniquely designed bungalow-style suites. Located in south of the island. A lot of green spaces, with 2 big pools that are very closed to the ocean.   PROS: Great family friendly resort with a lot of well-organized activities for both adults and kids throughout the day.  Many exotic animals such as peacock, flamingo, iguana that you could see in the resort.  Super friendly and helpful staff, Angelo and Lenar from the entertainment team worked tirelessly to keep everyone entertained. José, the captain in charge of service at restaurant was always there to make sure that we were taken care, especially after the incident that our son had an allergy reaction due to food in the first night. He took extra step to speak to the kitchen personnel about the incident in order to prevent it;4
I am here now .  The resort check in was good.  My room was in a good location.   The Television did not turn on at all, and the commode did not flush, but I don't watch tv and the commode ... I figured out how to get around that issue, by just lifting the entire lid!  I'll tell them when I check out tomorrow.  The shower was nice,  I had good hot water, beds are firm,  that works for me, and the rooms are very clean.   There is no bottled water in the rooms, they provide large glass bottles you have to fill up at the water stations positioned throughout the resort, the maids will not do this for you.    The beach has been made larger by pulling said in and you can walk along the sand by the hotel to enjoy Albertos that has great food and live entertainment.   The hotel offers;3
I’m so excited to be typing this right now! This resort is amazing and even though it’s our first trip to Mexico, we picked the absolute perfect resort to come to. I can’t say enough good things about the grounds and entertainment staff. Angelo, Edgar, Alejandra, Lenar, and Sofia were awesome and really put forth a ton of effort so we enjoyed our time here. Will definitely be coming back in the future!;5
My husband and I came to this resort for our 12-year anniversary…we were surprised by the peace, quiet, and beauty of this jungle resort.  We try new all inclusive resorts through the Caribbean about 3 times per year. I never hang out in our hotel room on vacation, but this time at the end of the day, I laid in the hammock on our deck to read.  All you hear is wind pushing the bamboo and birds.  So peaceful.  The bungalows looked just ok in online pictures, but they are so comfortable, with the deck and hammock being a big plus.    Entertainment-there were really good shows at night in the theater and trivia in lobby.  There were very few games/activities in the pool however.  Food was good all over.    No coffee shop but espresso and cappuccino in lobby.  One shop at hotel with;5
"This resort was such a wonderful experience for the price! We upgraded to ""near the pool"" rooms and were able to get all of our group right close by each other by booking directly through Iberostar. The resort is small and very walkable but still has 3 a la carte restaurants (we got to all 3 in our week and they were all good!). On nights you don't have an a la carte, I recommend walking to Alberto's for a  paid meal!  They had everything we were looking for here: all inclusive, swim up bar, a beach that is useable, and good food. We had a smaller dive company come pick us up at the beach instead of using the big boats on resort but the divers who did use them sounded happy with their experience. The couple days the company couldn't pick us up at resort, the taxi was 260 pesos";5
We've been to Cozumel 3 times now and Iberostar was by far one of my favorite resorts we've stayed at! The resort was beautifully kept, the food was good, and the ENTERTAINMENT....AHHH-MAZING! I would go back just for the entertainment, specifically Angelo, he made all the entertainment so much fun along with Lenar!! Angelo got us to play cornhole on the beach, a ball pitching game in the pool, a couples challenge on stage, and Karaoke in front of the entire resort haha never would have done that but again, Angelo was soooo much fun and it was hard to tell him know! Lenar got us to play giant beer pong, he helped Angleo with the ball pitching game, he also helped with the couples challenge on stage, and of course he helped me pick a song for Karaoke! All of the staff there were;5
The little thatched roofs were so cute and everything is less than a ten minute walk on the property! The negative things: food was average (I find that typical for all inclusive) and you can’t really swim at their beach because of all the rocks. The positives: shows were fun, the staff are kind and funny, the animals (lemur kind of creature, peacocks, macaws, iguana, and flamingos), filtered drinking  water all over the property, and  the security guard takes guests names and taxi drivers info before exiting.;4
This was our first time coming to Cozumel and Iberostar. The facilities and amenities were very clean and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly and easy to approach. Alejandra and Sofia from the entertainment staff made the trip very memorable with their games and dancing. Definitely will be coming back again.  Only things that could have been better were buffet for choices (Mexican was best), and bar lines at pool and beach bar could be long.;5
Great hotel and great staff. Had a relaxing break with lots of diving and good food. Impressed with the restaurant team who made huge efforts to cater for our food allergies. The food and overall service was perfect.  Big thank you to Fabian & Rogelio in the restaurant, the amazing burgers at the pool bar and the morning yoga classes on the beach!!;5
Loved every second of my time!!! Alejandra was the best!!! The pool was amazing with every song that was played, along with the games and activities that they provided for us every second and always staying active on our trip.;5
the hotel was amazing, the food was so great delicious! the drinks are also fine and the pool nice. we spent a great time with family and friends. the activities are so funny specially Alejandra from the entertainment team and all the star camp, karen, Rosy and ismael. than you everyone!!;5
We had a great stay there.  Pros: - the village is truly beautiful with well kept gardens and free roaming animals. - the sea and beach are very nice, remember to bring beachshoes because it’s a little bit rocky. Very interesting for divers - wifi coverage is excellent throughout the entire place. - Cozumel island deserves a visit - one special mention to the entertainment team: Angelo, Edgar,Alexandra, Sofia, Lenar and the singers. They have a great attitude and the shows are very well produced, certainly well above average.  Cons: - food is good but not exceptional, don’t bother with à la carte restaurants. - the rooms are generally humid and suffer from a severe lack of ventilation in bathrooms, which in turn causes mold.;5
We enjoyed 1 week of fantastic weather, food, and entertainment. The beach has fine sand and plenty of lounge chairs, there are plenty of restaurants to choose from and the food is amazing. The staff are very professional, kind, and friendly and they remember everyone’s name…very nice touch. The entertainers are top notch, especially the very talented  Amber and Danny. Just to name a few, Juan Carlos was a terrific concierge and super helpful, Ismael, Lenar, Angelo, and Sexy Edgar kept us busy all day long with pool fun, rifle shooting, archery, and night time fun at the shows. The resort was very clean and the hut-style rooms are so private, and the grounds are beautifully maintained. Flamingoes and peacocks surround the open air restaurants. The staff never stopped working and;5
One of the most important things in a vacation stay is the STAFF.  A few years ago, we stayed at a gorgeous resort in Riviera Maya and STILL had an unpleasant experience that put us off Mexican all-inclusives (read my reviews for details).   We decided to give it another try at Iberstar Cozumel over spring break with our 2 teenagers. WOW. We had an amazing vacation here, and largely due to the welcoming and efficient staff. The bartenders served perfectly mixed cocktails with speed and a smile, no matter how slammed their bars were. The wait staff were professional and pleasant in their service. Every single staff member greeted us with a warm hello as they walked past. The entertainers were amazing! The games and shows were so well produced and performed. Angelo exudes the most;5
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Iberostar Cozumel. As two single women my daughter and I felt very safe. Hotel is very clean, staff is very respectful and friendly, grounds are gorgeous and well manicured, we found the food to be excellent with lots of choices offered. The only thing missing is a night club but the super friendly entertainment team Lenar, Angelo, Edgar and Alejandra more than made up for it. The Rock show was fantastic, great singing and music.  The only downside is the expensive store in the lobby. Try and grab souvenirs in the downtown if you can and bring all your own toiletries. Too expensive to purchase on site. Although we did not participate in diving, this resort is very popular with divers. Overall a great experience for some real R&R.  If you’re;5
4th time there - still dependably great, Foof was great, Staff superb. Even during a buey time, the resort did not feel crowded. Only possible advice woud be to eliminate the day pass visitors. They had a tendency to be less considerate than full time guests.;5
The resort is lovely.  The food and the options are great. The maids were always accessible and cleaned our room daily. The view of the ocean was amazing. The resort over all is clean. It's a great place for family or a romantic getaway;5
We've been here a number of times and aiways enjoy the lovely tropical island, long clean beaches and very nice local population.  The Iberostar resort has a good location with two story bungalow residences, no higher than palm trees and a nice long beach with clean warm water.  Very good for off shore snorkeling or you can go for a boat cruise to snorkel off a nearby coral reef.  There are also lots of scuba diving tours for those who wish.  We mostly had our meals at the all-inclusive buffet restaurant and went to the nice evening entertainment after dinners.  So all in all, a very pleasant all-inclusive beach resort and we would definitely go back;4
A group of 9 of us from ago 3-82 had a great time at the Iberostar. This was our second time here. The food was very good in the buffet and the lunch buffet. The service was very good. The dessert were delicious. Our room was always clean and the bed was comfortable. They could use some new pillows.  The pools were always clean and the water aerobics were good. The entertainment staff did a great job. Our great nephew loved the kids club.   The shows at night especially the rock show and horror show were very good. They always had singers or games in the lobby before the show. A nice touch. The grounds are absolutely beautiful with all the lush plants and the birds and animals rooming around.  We all had a great time and I am sure we will be back.;4
My wife and I write this review with some Iberostar Resort experience as this was our 3rd vacation at Iberostar Cozumel and our 6th stay in an Iberostar Resort. We stayed at Iberostar Cozumel twice in 2019 and now again in 2022. We could not believe the changes over 2 years, not many of them positive (Please review our other reviews as they may also be helpful in your decision to stay at the Iberostar Cozumel).  We fully realize that the Covid pandemic that hit the world in March 2020 has devastated the tourism industry and some differences in operation are understandable, even expected. However, that does not excuse the significant short falls experienced during our early April stay with the resort appearing to be at close to full capacity.  The Good/The Bad & the Ugly  First;3
I was staying with my sister and cousins and we very much enjoyed our holiday.nice beach access with pier.  With the option to book a la cart restaurants and buffet you have a variety of choices to eat,especially enjoyed the attentive service of chef José and captain Fidel! Also amazing animators like Alejanda who cheered us up everytime we saw her!small but great gym which is in good hands of Manolo,very much enjoyed his expertise!  The hotel is very quiet but also bit far from center.;4
I have stayed here multiple times over the years, and my stay in March 2022 may have been the best:  the staff was excellent as always, the grounds lovely and very well kept, the food variety and flavors were really good (something for everyone, IMHO.)  The nightclub shows (rock and roll, horror show) were quite impressive for the singing/dancing/gymnastics and efforts put forth.  The resort also shows a commendable desire to reduce plastic bottle usage, etc, in an appropriate way.  Their free Covid testing system was much appreciated. I come here because the resort is close to the dive reefs but note that it is pretty far from the town, which should definitely be visited.  Room for improvement:  the shower soap/shampoo were pretty much unable to create a lather, and some of the;5
Honestly one of the most relaxing resorts anyone could ever ask for!! I loved this resort for so many reasons so I will break it down for you: 1) The resort was absolutely GORGEOUS. The nature, animal sounds, beach waves, wild life, and the character just made me feel so calm and comfortable. 2) Since the resort is really spread out, we got to explore different areas and came across so many different animals and places for photo ops! 3) THE ENTERTAINMENT TEAM- they made my boyfriend and I feel so welcomed and at home. They remembered our names and always made sure we were having a good time. Oh yes, and ANGELO, he is the sweetest most vibrant personality. He always had a smile on his face and made us feel so comfortable. Give him a raise!!! :) Overall, definitely would go back.;5
This is my second time here. The staff is great Luis, Ismael, Karen and Rosa at the Star Camp. The entertainment crew is awesome.  Angelo, Alejandra, Lenar and Edgar are really fun to watch. I love how they keep the place clean. I love all the beautiful nature's animals around the resort. Thank you from my family and me Alexanader Rambo.;5
Resort was nice. Food was ok. Came in on a Thursday they would only let us book  sit down dinner for 2 days, said to come back on Sunday for the 3rd sit down but came back Sunday and they had nothing available for a party of 2 or 4. Entertainment and activities staff (Lenar, Angelo, Alexahandra , and Edgar) were great but no activity after 10:45. No music, no night club. Bar in lobby (Bartenders and waitress were great) was open to 1. No music by pool except when we paid staff to use the speaker, which was only available twice for less then an hour on 2 days.;3
I wanted a vacation where my son could get a PADI open water diving certification.  Iberostar Cozumel was an option thru the PADI site and we couldn't have been more delighted with the stay.  The dive shop was top shelf and thus lots of divers at the resort which in my humble opinion sets the bar for polite considerate guests...early to bed, early to dive.   The rooms are in magical looking huts minutes from the beach and my wife was totally comfortable reading and swimming while we dove.  The food was quite delicious,fresh and plentiful.  And the staff...God bless them for having to wear masks 24/7 in the heat, were as polite and attentive as you could hope for.   I can't think of anything negative.  Did we luck out?  Maybe, but I'll take it and we are looking forward to a;5
Cozumel and Iberostar Resort - an incredible experience! Thank you A Way To Go Travel, and MY agent, Carmela Beth Butner.   Cozumel a diver’s paradise, add the resort, Iberostar was perfect for an early spring vacation, but this resort accommodates all - families, couples, a friend’s getaway, and yes, those who travel solo.  The Iberostar resort is located on the south end of the island. It’s tucked away in Caribbean forest and opens up to gorgeous turquoise water and beautiful white sand. It’s away from it all, secluded for a perfect relaxing, laid back vacation.  The villas have 4-8 apartments in each, not the stacked hotel like buildings. Landscape is that of a tropical jungle with the most beautiful landscape. Tall trees, beautiful flowers, pristine gardens surrounding these;5
It's our first day back home after a week at Iberostar Cozumel, and my body and soul are already going through withdrawals! Not just from the steady cocktail consumption that occurred (though it's 5 o'clock, and I am finding myself craving another margarita from hard-working Raymundo and Agustin at the pool bar!), but also from the tasty food, warm water, sweet smiles and kindness of staff, and beautiful sunsets!  Based on my only other experience at an all-inclusive (in Riviera Maya, ~12 years ago), I went into this with low expectations - and my time at Iberostar Cozumel FAR exceeded them in every regard. Some highlights:  -The entertainment team of Edgar, Angelo, Lenar, Alejandra was top notch.  I truly left feeling like they all had become friends, especially Lenar and;4
"I've been to a few all inclusive resorts but this one has it all. If you've done your research you will already know the atmosphere is jungle- y...loads of wandering tropical birds (parrots, flamingos, peacocks) and stunning landscaping with lush tropical trees and flowers. But the Best part? Hands down: the bungalows! No elevators or long corridors smelling like cleaning products. The bungalows are charming and cozy.   Next, the food, of course. I chose this resort based primarily on the excellent food ratings. You will not be disappointed.  The buffets are ridiculously good. Everything from comfort food ( pasta, roasts, fried fare) to "" made to order""mexican cuisine and high end cheeses and meats and salads. I would compare it to any higher quality American Sunday brunch...3 X";5
This was our 7th time to Mexico, and the Iberostar Cozumel is well below the standards of any other Mexican resort we've stayed at.  Here are some issues: 1.   food is well below average, especially in the Mexican and Steak a la carte restaurants - food was burned and steaks full of gristle 2.  the rooms are well below average, and very very basic 3.  the beach is rocky - you can definitely not swim in it 4.  room key not working in the door lock: went to the front desk numerous times, after two days they had to replace the total door lock unit 5.  property not maintained: door lock issue that we had - many others also had issue, fans throughout the property do not work, watch out for Mexican racoons 6.  used toilet paper cannot be disposed of in toilet - must be thrown in;3
Everything was great at this Iberostar property.  The individual bungalows are a unique touch that makes it really fun.  The staff there really make the stay special.  Angelo, Alejandra, and Edgar made our stay the best!  Thru out the day they always had fun activities for us to do.  At night the shows and trivia and bingo led by the same three all-stars made sure we always had something to do.  Raymundo and Augstin at the pool bar had good recommendations for drinks to keep it fresh.  It is just a matter of time before we make a return visit!;5
The staff were the best I have ever had the pleasure to interact with. Two of my waiters we're Alfonso and Milton. They were very professional and took care of us with. The Head waiter was Fidell who handled our special requests with ease. Three picky women and old goat like me , and they handled it like pros. Can't say enough great things about the staff and accomodations. Would and will, definitely stay here again.;5
We spent 11 days at Iberostar. The food is good. You have a big buffet and I could order glutenfree. Fidel is a perfect host. He is very friendly and very attentive and even know our names. The divespots are beautiful. We had a great time there.;4
The staff at the star kids club are fantastic. Rosa, Ismael and Karen kept my 5 year old son busy with fun crafts. Beautiful grounds and lots of wildlife. Good range of food to choose from with lots of vegetable options.;5
One of  the nicer resorts on Cozumel. I have been coming to Cozumel for many years and have tried numerous resorts/hotels. We are middle-aged scuba divers, and this resort worked very well for us. Pros: The grounds are beautiful. Lovely beach, lots of vegetation, flamingos and peacocks. Very well-kept, and clean. We really loved the layout of the resort. The staff is great! Friendly, helpful, and very professional. Everyone works so hard. We thought the food was good, for an all inclusive. For divers it worked out very nicely. We could do two dives in the morning, get dropped off, have a quick lunch, and the boat would pick us up for afternoon dives. In addition to the main restaurants and buffet, there is a grill outside near the beach/pool. Great to get a burger etc. without;5
Angelo is great!  Amazing body! Wow! Love you!  Alejandra is fantastic. Also Lenar amazing.  Thank you for making this trip the best.  Water aerobics and activities were the best!  Oh and there are hotel kitties.  So cute!;5
Angelo was fantastic!  Amazing body!  WOW. Not to mention his entertaining poolside and in the theater are top notch.   Alejandra absolutely adorable, friendly, and so much energy.  She knows how to reach and rally the crowd.  Lenar, this young man will go far. Entertaining is spectacular but his personal touch to guests with casual conversation makes us all feel special. A kind and genuine human. Look out world!;5
Angelo was fantastic!  Amazing body!  Wow!  Alejandra, the beauty of the team, and Lenar were super great too!  Had fun any time the entertainment crew came around.  The morning aqua aerobics got us started every day in the pool.  Very enjoyable time!;5
This resort is family friendly, but definitely not over-ran by children.  The food decent, standard resort food.  The resort is amazingly clean!! The entertainment team was full of energy....especially Angelo!!  Angelo was full of talent and energy,  and worked the crowd good!;5
Our family has travelled to Cozumel many times. We are divers with young children and love the flexibility and diversity of activities this resort provides! There is truly something for everyone! While the kids didn’t attend Star Camp, they still enjoyed the activities by the beach with Rosa, Karen and Ismael. Daily 4:00 dancing by the pool with Alejandra was beyond exhilarating and the perfect 2nd wind for all of us!! The food is fabulous and easily accessible. The rooms are clean and comfortable, but not at all fancy.  Of course, the beautiful reefs will bring us back to Cozumel, but no doubt the kids will ask to come back to Iberostar!;5
Had a great stay! Came with 3 friends and had a blast. The resort was mostly middle aged to elderly couples but there were a few younger people, definitively not a spring break resort though. The highlight was definitively Reyes and the pool bar. Highly recommend staying here. And if you do, tip Reyes well!;5
"The zumba with angelo was awesome. The night time entertainment was also great, thanks to Alejandra, Lenar, edgar and Angelo. There was always something to do around the resort to keep us busy. The grounds are beautifully kept. The food was great. The drinks are ""ok"". The rooms need a bit of attention, but i would all in all still recommend this resort and would stay here again. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, they bend over backwards for guests.";5
Such an amazing group of camp counselors! They have kept my kids engaged with painting bags, jewelry making, making masks, games and so much more. Rosa, Karen, and Ibereal have been truly amazing. They have such incredible energy and are so welcoming!;5
What a great time at this resort!!  Everyone was excellent and very accommodating from check in to check out.  They took great care of our group of 5 adults and 5 teens.  The food and drinks were great as always.  We especially enjoyed our night in the steak house and Mexican night on the buffet.  We felt like food was even better than on our previous visits.  I wish I could remember everyone's names to list them separately.  The Star Friends team (Angleo, Lenar, and Alejandra) worked great together.  We enjoyed the shows, the pool games, and the other activities with them.  Finally, we had a great experience diving with Dressel right there on sight.  The only things I'd like to see improved is coffee easily available earlier (preferably near the beach) and guacamole back at the;5
there is nothing special about this hotel. i had been there before and this time i went for diving. there was no fire show or pool suds party.  the food was ok although  repetitive. the property is nice.  it would be nice if the top floor room numbers were on the bottom of the stairs rather than having to walk half way up the stairs just to find your going to the wrong room.  the biggest issue i have is that they have gone away from plastic bottles and have gone to glass. i grew up in the sixties and seventies and remember when people cut their feet on broken glass. i saw glass chards beside the path in the grass. be careful when walking in the glass. i put one of the glass water containers in the side of the bar fridge and when i opened the fridge it fell and smashed all over;3
This was my 6th trip to this resort. My husband and I finally agreed to bring our young adult children. They loved it just as much as we did. The food was awesome but what was even better was the staff. They were always right there to help with everything. The entertainment staff was great. Edgar is always so fun to watch. You can always see the joy that dancing brings him. We did miss Angelo this trip (he was off for the week) but were told we will see him again in October. I hope so because he always adds that extra flare to our trip. My daughter and I enjoyed craft time on the beach with Rosa. Winning bingo balls every night was always fun with Alejandra. Iberostar in Cozumel is my favorite place. The size, the staff and the accommodations are absolutely AMAZING!;5
"Especially Angelo, from the entertainment team, made a great effort to be super personal and engaging all week long. From around the resort during ""aquagym"" to before any evening show.  Dressel Divers did a great job of running the dives even though 2 days were canceled due to the harbor being closed (too windy and not their fault). Omar, Anna, Eva, and Diego were GREAT dive leaders.  Food was plentiful and delicious regardless of eating at the main buffet or the Oriental or Steakhouse restrauant.";5
Congratulations to the Iberostar Cozumel for having all the cats TNR'ed.  That's Trap Neuter Release for those not in the loop for feral cats. Left ear docked is the universal sign that this has been done.  Though I loved everything about the Iberostar, I was most impressed by the cat that came to my room (for the ham I took from the buffet),  that had his left ear docked.  Thank-you to whoever has taken the initiative to do this!;5
"Each year our group of couples make our way down to Iberostar Cozumel for so many reasons.  The beauty of the resort, comfortable & clean rooms and common areas, the wildlife, wonderfully presented, tasteful food, desserts & bars available all hours and locations around the resort; the gorgeous beach, pool and plentiful lounge chairs throughout the resort for relaxation; the list could go on and on; they do it right, thoughtfully and consistently every year.    A wonderful group of talented staff provide a variety of entertainment events throughout the day and each evening; their most precious treasure in this group is ANGELO.. We seek him out each year to say our hellos & enjoy his smile, laughter, personality and ability to make you feel so happy is beyond anyone we have ever";5
We just finished an 8 day stay at the Iberostar Cozumel.  It is the southernmost resort on the island.  We chose the resort because of the tropical setting, unique huts and snorkeling off of the beach.  The setting was amazing.   The  landscaping and walkways were spread out and filled with tropical plants and flowers. There were several animals (flamingos, Mexican raccoon, peacocks, iguanas) that kept visitors entertained.  The buffet restaurants and steakhouse were outside with open air seating under thatched roofs.  The property is spread out which was perfect for walking each morning.    The rooms were small but comfortable.  There was a musty smell and because of the high humidity, and it always felt like things were damp.  The beds were relatively comfortable.  There is a;4
"Despite the 5 stars on the entrance sign, this is a 3 star hotel.   First, if you are going there for diving, their onsite company Dressel Divers, is ok not great. Divemasters are friendly but the boats are overcrowded and chaotic.   Hotel: Positives: the food was great (esp impressive for all-inclusive buffet), good shows, relatively good service given the number of people.   Downsides: The biggest one: the hotel did “maintenance” from 11-4 one day where they cut power and water with minimal warning (yes - toilets were a disaster); EVERYONE wants a tip all the time, poor attention to details (Eg no tea at breakfast, ice machine frequently out of our ice)  It’s a big resort that manages high throughput - so just be aware of that.";3
Once you come here, you won't want to leave or go to another resort again. The service is absolutely wonderful from all the staff. Great food, drinks and diving at this location. This is our second year here and Angelo, one of the star friends is our absolute favorite! We were hoping to see him again as he makes the stay entertaining and memorable. He remembered us from the previous year, which is remarkable considering the amount of guests that come in and out of the resort.;5
If you dive or if you want a laid back pleasant vacation and if you want a friendly atmosphere, then come here. And Angelo - he’s awesome. He’s part of the entertainment team who are All Wonderful but he remembers everyone’s name and is friendly, kind and funnier than funny.     If you dive and want to stay at a resort that offers everything,  you can do it without leaving the property.;5
Wonderful dove operation on site, the food is wonderful and the staff is the best I've had at a resort. Was so excited Angelo (part of the great entertainment team) was still here, he has been a highlight and constant smile for 2 years coming to the iberostar.;5
Wonderful anniversary trip. What a great resort! We loved the beautiful gardens, the colorful thatched roof buildings and the amazing food. We came for the diving center and had a great experience. The spa was lovely as was the fitness center. Manolo did a great job with the fun Zumba classes on the beach. Highly recommend for people with families as well as travelers who like an authentic experience. This is a gem of a place.;5
Beautiful resort! Lenar has been so gracious during our stay. His sense of humor and caring personality has made the stay both relaxing and one that will be remembered! He is truly genuine. The grounds at the resort are breathtaking, will return.;5
"The venue is beautiful, beaches, food, staff, Entertainment love it all!   Love the evening entertainment; talented,  sexy and , picante Angelo.  Love his Michael Jackson Thriller and Zoomba in the pool. He makes us laugh.  Antonio was very attentive and calm in Scuba Training.  Buffet was so good. Loved the Fresh fruit.  Steak house rib eye tasty and juicy.  Massage was incredible too.";5
Quaint lil resort village.  Quiet yet felt comfortable getting just a lil rowdy.  Slept like a baby.  Food was good and selection varied.  Employees are very friendly and accommodating.  Beautiful setting.  Evening shows in theater were entertaining.  Very clean.  Wonderful place for people with any age of children or none at all.  Was not too crowded and always had chairs at the pool or beach.  I would return to this resort.;4
This was our fourth year in a row to this resort! Every year the stay gets a little longer! The staff remembered us and greeted us like old friends.  Angelo, Edgar, Leonard and Alejandra always engage and make you feel so welcomed. They work so hard preforming such entertaining shows every evening!  Ana who serves at the pool and the beach is amazing, we love her so much!! This resort is beautiful, I love all the plants, birds and butterflies.  We will see you again next year Iberostar!;5
"First things first: The staff at this resort are really absolutely amazing, and make all the difference here. I really wish I could name everyone who made our week special, from the restaurant staff, to the bartenders, to the excellent housekeeping, and the lovely bell services gentleman who helped me out several times. But I will name who I can – Isidro at the pool bar who remembered my drinks and kept my glass full; and especially Lenar, Angelo and Alejandra who ran the activities – everything from pool games, to salsa lessons, to the “shooting range” and all the personal, friendly attention. Those three are the hardest working, most cheerful and upbeat folks I have ever met. And I can’t believe how they get to know us all personally and remember names and details! We loved";4
Presentation is the strong suit here.  Beautiful resort on a beautiful site.  Multiple thatched roof buildings set in a well maintained 'jungle' landscape on a great beach right off some of the world's best dive sites.  The staff is professional and works diligently to provide great service.    Positives include:  Clean! , AC works well, beautiful food with large selection of choices, nice pool - bars - grill - beach lounge chairs - activities and entertainment.   Only minor negatives: I could not find a working ice-machine on the grounds, beds are hard and pillows are too small.;4
We have loved this place and been coming here for 10 years, this time being our 4th time. It has a great exotic feel. They seem to have made some changes or are short staffed or something because your hot spots like the bars, especially the pool bar and beach bar, had only one employee and would take forever to get a drink and the drinks were terrible, whereas previous years they were good. The restaurant in the morning to eat breakfast was a terrible layout because you had one person on each side to cook eggs and get your food off the buffet (due to covid restrictions they get it for you). This always caused a line of people waiting even if they only wanted food off the buffet. The Lunch and Dinner buffet was a smoother service. These are simple fixes but, in my opinion, would;3
We stayed one week End of March in this Hotel - travelling  the 4th time to Mexico, this hotel was definitely one of the best. Beautiful and vey well maintained environment, respecting nature and animals. The rooms were ok, little bit old fashioned but very clean. A big thank you to Lenar and Angelo, their motivation and huge talent was a big plus and made us feel at home. If I should mention a negative point it is the Steakhouse were the Sirloin steak was tough (quasi uneatable), French fries were served cold - service was not good neither: long wait time and no drink service during the meal. All in all I would highly recommend this place and we certainly will come back;5
Always a fun vacation!  Star Camp for the kids was wonderful with fun arts and crafts and games!   We were disappointed that the paint your own pottery stand wasn’t open while we were there by Star Camp made up for the crafty souvenirs.  Thank you Karen, Ismael, & Rosa 🎨!  If you want to have a consistent flow of entertainment options (Manolo 💃🏻, Angelo 🤸🏻‍♂️, Lenar 🥇, Gabriel 🏊🏻‍♀️) , diving on-site (shout out to my Shrimp Basket Diana 🤿), a beautiful beach with palms trees intertwined, a fun pool, and a friendly crew (Fabian 🤵🏻) then this is the place for you!;5
Rosa, Karen and Ismael were in charge of kids club at star camp. They were amazing. Lots of great activities. Our two boys loved every time. Can't recommend enough. The rest of the resort was amazing. Lovely food. Amazing staff. Really friendly and great value for money.;5
Amazing trip as usual, never disappointed! Even post pandemic, this place never fails to please. We were so happy with all the amenities, food, entertainment, seclusion and landscape (nature and wildlife). The Star friends (Iberostar entertainers) are truly amazing talent and a pleasure to be around ( Angelo, Lenar, Alejandra, Rosa, and the rest) Thank you for the great hospitality and entertainment StarFriends! The family was very pleased and we plan on coming back soon!!;5
Everything was amazing. The food is great, that activities are fun and awesome. Angelo, Lenar, and Edgar do a fantastic job with the activities. The shows are amazing and fun the 70’s shows and the rock show are the best ones. The lights in the shows were also amazing and they did a great job;5
"We stayed for a week--husband part of a 20 person dive group, wife a non-diver. We have stayed here several times before, and were not disappointed.  Check in and restaurant reservations (3 for a week stay) and booking our covid test all were fast and easy.  Our room on the 2nd floor of a building was clean, comfortable and convenient.  Pool area was ok, get there early to reserve a chair.  Bar service usually pretty quick. Restaurants were good/what you would expect at an all-inclusive.  Gym was good--shout out to Manolo.  Aqua gym class daily also good-Lenar and Angelo very fun and friendly and the workouts were pretty good.  Evening shows were good, very good music, singing and dancing and even an aerialist, minus the Karaoke night and ""The Perfect Couple"" shows which were";4
This is the place. The park-like pathways, abundant foliage, colorful birds and reptiles, fluttering butterflies, ample beach and pool seating, (WITH SHADE!!) made this exactly what we hoped our vacation would be. If you are looking for loud music, lots of drunken and obnoxious people, this is not the place for you. The staff was kind and professional, but not in our face. The food was quite good for an all-inclusive, especially the Mexican Restaurant. The bungalow room was small but clean and appealing and we loved the little hammock and chairs on the porch. The beds were very comfortable.;5
As people describe here, the resort its beautiful and the food is good. Beautiful well manicured grounds with friendly animals throughout.     A couple of things they could do better: 1. Kind of a low energy sleepy resort: The resort is very family friendly and it seems like it caters more to the senior crowd. There is no music by the pools. Not much of entertainment in the night other than their shows. Don't expect to be dancing late in the night.  2. The buffet is their star on their food, especially the breakfast. The main restaurants are not that wonderful. Among the restaurants the mexican is the best. You get better steak in the US.  3. Getting to the city is like $25 taxi ride. If you plan to go into the city, plan for that.;4
Our family stayed here and were very disappointed. I had booked  for 2 adults and 2 children and when we checked in we were told that our children (ages 13 & 15) were too old to be considered children so they made us pay for 4 adults. The rooms are nice and the beds are very comfortable. Try getting a room away from the water sports, as you will hear the loud clanking of O2 tanks being loaded every morning.   The food was so-so, the steak restaurant is the best one. Make sure to book a dinner reservation early as they fill up quickly and space is very limited. We made all of our reservations for the entire trip on the day we checked in and are glad we did because we tried changing restaurants one day and were told they were booked 3 days out.   Big annoyance: this is our 5th;2
The resort was very nice and well cared for. The staff was helpful and friendly. I was very impressed with the care they are taking to preserve the environment . No straws or single use plastic anywhere  they provide all things, such as soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in refillable wall mounted containers, so no plastic there either .  The buffet as well as the specialty restaurants have good selection of foods and I had no complaints on any of it. Would definitely recommend this place.;4
Amazing. The resort is clean and super friendly. I liked the activities the rifle and archery is fun. The food is amazing. The service is great. The entertainment team Angelo and Lenar are awesome and so fun.;5
The pros: Beautiful grounds  Wildlife Nice beach (bring water shoes) Snorkeling from beach Excellent buffet Incredible staff/service  The cons: Sparsely appointed room (no luggage rack, one plastic chair) Sloppily painted bathroom Porches overlook other porches Very disappointing “specialty restaurants” (Skewered vegetables were mostly raw onions and peppers) Extremely loud “DJ”/entertainment at pool (uses microphone that can be heard from the beach)  We only went to the “show” one night.  It was a “rock show” with a medley of popular hits, mostly from the 70s and 80s.  Very entertaining.;3
Our family was here for spring break we choose this resort for location and all the vegetation beautiful area. The staff was very accommodating the entertainment was great. Edgar Angelo Lenar Daniel Amber Alli are top notch performers singers and dancers. Thank you all.;5
Very friendly staff especially Alejandra who organized lots of outdoor activities and Fidel who was a superb server in one of the all inclusive restaurants . Very good cleaning service as well . We are not usually all inclusive customers but we enjoyed the delicious breakfast buffet and thought the food was of a decent quality as long as you are not looking for gourmet food .  We enjoyed the low key atmosphere in the very charming and colorful two story bungalows . The resort seemed to be close to capacity but neither the restaurants nor the swim up bar at the pool seemed overcrowded at any time . The lounge chairs were at times crowded but we still managed to score one on all 4 days. The beach was rocky and therefore we went to swim from the boat dock which had a stepladder;4
This resort was amazing! The staff are so nice.  The entertainers (Alejandra, Angelo and Leonard) were fun and friendly!  Adolfo in the main restaurant was super impressive!  He recognized us when we walked in at every meal and made sure we were taken care of.  Manuel was also super helpful with bags and anything else we needed.  I will definitely return!  One hiccup with our trip was when we had to switch rooms in between dives.  I ended up leaving a couple of items in our old room which were not returned.  The rooms are nice but at times can get warm.  The rooms have some sort of sensor, which causes the air conditioning to shut off even when you are in the room.  Overall, I loved this resort and highly recommend it.;5
Overall, I had a great experience with the Iberostar Cozumel staff was incredibly helpful, great waitstaff, huge shout out Fabian, he truly went above and beyond to make us feel at home when it came time to eat and the amenities were great.  Housekeeping was great and so polite. the room was wonderful and clean  I have a 4yo and Star Camp is just amazing, my son loved going to camp while we were there, it allowed me time to myself. They really do keep them busy! Thank you Ismael, Rosa & Karen, you guys made his trip very memorable.  We had my parents 40yr vow renewal there, the process and planning was easy. Everything was ready to go come wedding day, my mom loved her bouquet and the cake was delicious! I will say that the only bad thing was they only had one photography vendor;5
"This is an amazing resort! This was a trip with friends and family (one toddler) and the property was perfect for everyone. The pools are huge and they have a huge beach area with white sand and some trees. The lobby area is spacious and there is a lot to do! Best of all, the staff are amazing! It feels like everyone wants to help you and is genuinely happy you are there. I have been at other all inclusive resorts where this is not the case . The rooms are nice because it isn't a high rise hotel, they are all small ""villas"" in groups of 4. Makes it really easy to walk from anywhere on the property to your room. The one downside is they are pretty small. We had 3 people staying in one double and the room was pretty cramped. The beds are full size. I would either get a king bed";5
First of all, the Cozumel Airport was a breeze compared to Cancun.      Upon arriving at the resort, the grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Check in was easy and staff was good.  Next stop was Concierge to arrange our specialty dining.  He was all business and said little more.      Rooms were also OK but nothing special.  Room had a scent of raw sewage, but we were anxious to get to the beach, we unpacked, changed and headed down to water.      Though no fault of Iberostar, beach was covered with sargassum.  The beach front had plenty of chairs, some were in shade!       Next stop was beach bar.  There were 6 or 8 people waiting for drinks from one bartender. Drinks were average but the DosXX on tap was cold. The only bourbon at any bar was Jim Beam.      Food at the;3
Stayed here 10 years ago and it was great. Food was even better, accommodations were updated, staff was amazing and entertainment was waaaay beyond our expectations. They had an evening of star watching with huge telescopes, projection screens and informative interactions that was spectacular! Then fun dancing to their duo Singers that were very high end. All entertainment was well worth going! The rock night and horror night were so fun! All al la carte restaurants were good. We’ll be back.  Wish there was better coffee, but espresso/coffee machine at breakfast was good. Bar barista at pool and lobby were excellent. We brought our own yoga mats but rentals, complementary mats and classes would be appreciated.;5
We’ve returned to Iberostar Cozumel for our 3rd time now. We’ve also been to other dive resorts in Cozumel over the years. Again we were very happy with our decision. The on-site dive shop as well as the proximity to the best reef means we’ll come back again soon. The resort is ecological which is important to us. The amazing fresh food and variety kept us happy all week. The staff is very professional and always smiling. Great job everyone!;4
Such a fun place to stay, brought our two kids with us and they had the best time ever, the night shows were so fun to watch. Everyone that works on the resort are such amazing people. Food was amazing;5
Alejandra is the best!!! She’s has good entertainment  We really enjoyed the food, the dancing lessons, the beach! We loved Hector the waiter, he was sweet and always smiling and also the girl from the store. We wanna come back for sure!;5
This is my family's second trip to Iberostar Cozumel and it could not have gone better. The grounds were lovely, the food was above average for an all inclusive and the staff did their jobs well and was friendly. We will be returning again. Extra high five to the activities staff - they absolutely get the most points if there is a service staff competition! They went above and beyond. I also want to mention the hotel made the US mandated Covid protocols extremely easy to manage.;5
From the moment that we checked in to the time we checked out ten days later it was a memorable experience. We had the same person check us out of the resort that checked us in and he remembered my name as well as room number, Now that is service. Thank You Eduardo. The restaurant captains, Star Friends and Wait & Bar Staff seemed to go out of their way to acknowledge you by name and make you feel welcome and like family.  I would like to Thank and acknowledge the following Iberostar employees. Restaurant Captains Fernando, Roberto, Fabian, Omar and Fidel, Star Friends Angelo, Lenar, both Alejandra's and Edgar. Wait and Bar Staff Angely, Ana, Guadalupe, Aidan, Adolfo, Felipe, Wilber, Ivonne and Ruby for all of their Great and friendly service.  I would like to point out that we;5
The staff is great, the shows are really good some very talented singers, the hotel rooms are not overly luxuries, but definitely a quiet and relaxing vibe.  The only negative is people putting towels to save chairs, so finding a chair can be a challenge.  For us we were in the water, so didn't matter.;5
"Every part of our stay at the Iberostar Cozumel was perfect! The resort, the grounds, the staff, the food, the drinks, the rooms....all perfect! The resort was not too big and and too small. I'm glad there was not loud - awful music blasting near the pool. I like to relax and hear the ocean waves. All of the staff, bartenders, housekeeping were great. The front desk check in was fast and easy. Alex at the concierge desk was very helpful. Caesar at the Jeep rental was was excellent at explaining the rental agreement.  My wife and I think that Alejandra is the ""diamond of the resort""!! You cannot be in a bad mood while talking to Alejandra. We hope she is there when we return for our second visit!";5
Only two negatives: The internet was slow and unprotected. Some guests would place towels on the pool chairs to reserve them then go on an extended snorkeling trip and only come to the chair after they got back meanwhile many of us that played fair were left without seating. Everything else was outstanding. Multiple food stations eliminated along buffet lines and the food was delicious. The rooms were very nice and were serviced daily. The nightly entertainment was also outstanding. Booking tours was painless, we met with Carlos the first day and set up fishing, snorkeling, etc. for the week. Everything was kept clean and neat. All of the associates wore masks all the time. The resident animals were great and at the risk of upsetting some dog lovers it was a real treat to be;5
Traveled here for my sisters wedding. It was a beautiful resort, very clean, the staff was amazing! We loved interacting with the entertainers - Edgar, Lenar and team. Felt very safe. We will be back!;5
I have been a scuba diver for about 20 years and finally convinced my family to certify.  We chose Dressel Divers and Iberostar Cozumel for our adventure.  Our rooms were perfect...we had a family suite, which was two rooms adjoining, each with their own bathroom.  Very nice, extremely quiet, and always clean!  The grounds were well maintained and there was always someone picking up, trimming, caring for the resort.  Maid service was timely and good.    The food at the resort was fantastic for a family with two teenage boys.  We ate at the main buffet most of the time.  To those who complain about the food/buffet.  Yes, sometimes the food is the same.  Yes, sometimes it sits out a while.  It's a buffet.   We enjoyed their onsite Asian, Tex Mex, and Steakhouse restaurants.  The;5
The food was not very good. Only allowed to eat at specialty restaurants twice during our 5 night stay. The ribeye was inedible. Found myself eating a banana for breakfast every morning. The pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris were not sweet at all. Even the rum and cokes did not taste right. Our room was pretty bad- there was a light hanging out of the ceiling in the bathroom, a panel off the wall, the ceiling fan wobbled so much I was afraid it was going to fall on us and the AC was never fixed the entire time we were there. The water units we had to get drinking water from were a joke. The closest one to us was out of service so we had to walk all over to find others. And the ice machines never worked. For what you pay to go on an all inclusive trip, I was very;2
"Second stay in 13 months.  Room by the pool enables one to listen to the music from Albertos while relaxing on the hammock.  Food was really good. Service was excellent. Rock show by the entertainment staff was outstanding. Luis Gomez, concierge, set everything up for us as soon as we checked in and made sure to ask if everything was going well every time he saw us.  Only hiccup this trip was 9 hours without hot water. Nothing came out of the faucet when just hot was turned on. The front desk took down our name and room number, told us that our bill would be adjusted; however, when we checked out they told us there was no record of it and no adjustment was made.  We will return";5
Just returned from 10 days at the Iberostar Cozumel so here are some thoughts.  *Don't ask for iced coffee in the restaurants.  Go to the lobby bar and they will fix up a nice one for you. *All the specialty restaurants had delicious food.  The Oriental had great sushi, even for those who think they don't like it!  Salmon was wonderful at the steak one and the Oriental one.   *The buffet restaurants had a wide assortment that should please anyone.  We ate there for 10 days and always found something new to try.  French fries at the beach grill are the best!  Try the Mango Tango drink (non-alcoholic).  *To the people that suggested bringing a clothesline for the balcony, thanks.  Nice to be able to hang out towels and suits. *Some complained about the wetness of clothes and the;5
This is our second trip to Iberostar within a 3 month span.  We loved it so much the first time, we went back.  It did not disappoint.  The staff is amazingly friendly.  The food is good, and the atmosphere is perfect.  The entertainment team is awesome.  Angelo is unforgettable.  Super fun and friendly.   We went there mainly to Dive the reef using The Dressel Dive shop that is right on campus.  You can't go wrong.  GREAT dive masters who are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly.  Tamera, Omar, Javi are great but Ceci is the best.  We highly recommend them.;5
Iberostar seems to make everyone happy. There is a wonderful pool, delicious food, snorkeling off the beach, helpful staff and a calm atmosphere. Our kids did star camp each afternoon and Ismael, Rosa and Karen took great care of them and did so many activities. The staff at the restaurants and snack bar are very nice. We did a snorkeling tour set up by the front desk and saw turtles, starfish and many fish. What a fantastic place!;5
Our first time visiting the island and resort. Food was excellent, service even better! Activities throughout the day, entertainment in the evening. Edgar was amazing, so energetic and friendly, evening entertainer, and daytime event coordinator. Angelo…shakes his body like no other during the evening entertainment and super friendly during the day for activities! Isidro my favorite pool bartender! Super attentive and friendly! My daughter got married on the beach there and they did an exceptional job! Housekeeping did a great job too! We did have an issue on our first day with our a/c, they fixed it immediately. Huts are near everything, restaurants and beach and pool. Water exercises were a ton of fun too!(I’m not an exerciser!! Lol)  Very family oriented resort.  Every person;5
Beautiful property scattered with flamingos and peacocks.  Delicious food, clean lovely rooms, friendly, helpful employees, lots to do but nothing forced on you.  Went diving with Dressel Divers who were amazing. Excellent guides/equipment. Sun around the pool and sun or shade on beach.  Music but not too loud.  Other guests friendly and NO drunks like some all inclusive.  Excellent health club which is unusual.  I will definitely return.;5
Excellent  place,the best grounds,location  and food. Housekeeping this time was not as good as always,very short on towels,the last day the maid took dirty towels from the bed and put them up hanging!!! No more swans made of towels,it was a very nice special  feature..gone..,mini bar was not filled every day..;5
Wonderful resort. Great entertainment! Alejandra, Lenar, and Angelo were terrific entertainers. Entertainment 10/10, Food 8/10. Drinks 7/10, resort 10/10, rooms 10/10. Resort and beach was very clean and there was plenty to do daily.;5
This was me and my wife's 9th time to this resort. Such an amazing way to relax and unwind. The resort grounds are beautiful and we love the cottage style rooms. The buffet restaurants serve a wide variety of food. The staff are so gracious and friendly. We have to give a shout out to the bartenders, waiters, and waitresses. Thank you Daniela and Angelo for keeping us laughing at the pool everyday. Thank you Ana, Glendy, Adrian, Raymundo, Edgar and Reyes for another amazing week and your hospitality. Thank you Rosa for the big smiles and greeting everyday. Another amazing vacation with our friends from Cozumel. Thank you all so much.          Sincerely Mike and Stephanie.;5
We visited at the beginning of March for a few nights. Iberostar was an amazing paradise and it was so hard to leave there! We initially booked Explorean but read that the beach was closed so cancelled and booked at Iberostar, BEST decision ever!! I will definitely be back at Iberostar and am not interested in checking out other resorts as our experience here was just amazing from start to finish. All the staff are incredibly kind and helpful! COVID rules are well enforced and most areas are 'open' spaces so it feels safe eating in the breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets. Beds and rooms were very clean and comfy! We had an issue with our shower not draining but I think it was fixed.   Again, all the staff are incredible and work hard to make sure you have all that you need.;5
My friend and I visited the resort this spring break after my family had been here years ago, and I was reminded why I think of this place so fondly. After talking to many of the other guests, I heard that they have had the same experience and keeping coming back regularly.  The staff of this resort are absolutely unbeatable. This includes the servers, bartenders, and of course, the entertainment team. Alejandra and Edgar knew our names after our first night there and went out of their way to give us a memorable trip every day afterwards.   Every meal was delicious and a great experience because of the friendly hosts and waiters. We especially enjoyed the Mexican restaurant on the resort.   Could not imagine a better way to spend my spring break and was super sad to leave, but;5
