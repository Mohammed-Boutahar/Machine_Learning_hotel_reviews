We were met by 2 staffs from the Riad who took our luggage (2 couples) and swiftly navigated the streets and led us to an unassuming door. When we stepped in the Riad was just beautiful.  We spent three nights in two rooms, Gingembre & Vanilla.  Both rooms were lovely, spacious, clean and beautifully decorated.  Bedding was firm and comfortable.  The roof terrace was beautiful and large, with a beautiful view of the Medina and the Koutoubia mosque in the south and in the distance on clear days, the Atlas mountains.    But what makes this such a great place to stay is the handy local cell phone, the extremely hospitable staffs and complimentary laundry service.  They gave you a cell phone to use. It had the Riadâs number programmed into it, so if you got lost they could give you;5
The Empire is our first choice for hotel in Manhattan.  Great location, close to excellent restaurants, entertainment and subways.  Walking distance to Central Park and the museums.  Lots of character and charm and a boss rooftop bar.;5
Hotel is so busy with people and in a wonderful location. However, a friendly staff, Mohamed, made the check in nice and gave it a personal feel. I am so thankful.  The Room has an awesome view from the 29th floor.;5
Absolutely fantastic staff! They truly were over accommodating at every step of the way. The front desk team were able to get my colleague and I an early check-in. The bellmen were also lovely. The room was large and had all the amenities necessary for a business trip.;5
Great spot for a quick weekend getaway. If you're attending a performance at Lincoln center this is a nice option. Staff was very welcoming, helpful during our stay. Room was a bit on the small side, but it was fine for us.;5
Great place good staff central location had a great time celebrating daughters birthday tick tock diner great American breakfast but the trattatoria not great food very ordinary. 3 rd time here and would come again;5
I'm not sure why the reviews are as low as they are. This is a great hotel, although the front desk always seems to have slow computers, it is not the fault of the staff. We were greeted warmly and our rooms were immaculate. Then in the middle of the night, my disabled sister fell out of bed and my husband and I could not lift her. I called down to the front desk asking for assistance and almost immediately Cedrick arrived to save the day (or night). He not only immediately returned my sister to her bed but called for backup with Fredrick and positioned her back in a comfortable place , calming her all along the way. I don't know what we would have done without the clear thinking Cedrick who then brought us a wheelchair and a bathing chair that we should have requested in the;5
This is without a doubt the best hotel Iâve stayed in, everything was truly perfect. The staff were kind and genuine, they were able to provide recommendations and helped us sort a tour of the city. The hotel itself was a beautiful building with stunning uninterrupted views of the Atlas Mountains from the rooftop, sunset was a real highlight up there. The food was amazing, breakfast each morning was excellent and the dinners surpassed all expectation - which led to us eating at the hotel three times during our stay!! Thank you for making our stay a memorable one, we hope to be back soon.;5
Convenient location: Right next to Madison SQ garden and a subway stop. Walk a little bit more and thereâs Times Square! Nice view: I stayed on the 22nd floor and I was able to see The Empire State Building!  One night was a little under $170 (which is a steal for its location), but they allowed us to check in 2 hours earlier than the check in time so that was awesome ðð»;5
Firstly, I am loath to sing the praises of this hotel as I am trying to organise a stay with my husband in October - and will be gutted if we can't get a room! Everything about this place exceeded my expectations.   First impressions count - we arrived late after 24+ hours of travel & the doorman was quick to assist us with our luggage. Front desk check in was like catching up with an old friend â Majid went out of his way to find out where we were from, share a little insight and get us checked in quickly. We went with a deluxe room and werenât disappointed. This was one of many hotels spanning our USA trip and was by far the best in terms of value for money, location & staff.  Bathroom was huge, beds super comfy, shower pressure & temperature were fab, housekeeping spot on,;5
If you want to visit New York City, I strongly recommend to stay at The New Yorker Hotel! Itâs THE best and authentic place to stay, with gym, business center, fast WiFi, and really wonderful rooms. It is my third stay here, and every time it was just perfect. AND: It has not only one of the greatest lobbies, but also one of the best receptionists in town: Mohammed! So friendly, so helpfully, I was really well received - he made my day! Mohammed is in a class of his own!;5
Me and my girlfriend stayed at the empire hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is located in a great place in the center of Manhattan and next to all the main attractions of the city (and if it's not close enough you have a metro station nearby) . The best thing in the hotel was the  great staff!  When we arrived to the lobby bar we met Mor, she was so kind to us, we had a little chat and She even helped us with directions in the city and recommendations for restaurants and bars nearby... next day she even remembered to ask us how was the place that she recommended on day before and if we're enjoying our stay ... she definitely made the difference for us in our stay!;5
The staff was friendly and helpful. The food at the restaurant was very overpriced. Other than that, the location was excellent. We had an issue with our air conditioner not cooling. We contacted the front desk and the problem was resolved by engineering in about 15 minutes.;5
Miss Neida Aldama, the communication Manager at the New Yorker Hotel, was very helpfull with our booking. She was so nice to sort out everything and contacted us several times to make sure that everything came well. Thank you so much for all the work you put in. We realy appreciate it.;5
Our son was married Memorial Day weekend, and many wedding guests stayed at the Empire.  Courtney Audette worked with me for the past month coordinating the welcome bags for the guests.  Luis ensured the guests received their bags upon check-in, and was patient for the numerous times we sought him out with questions about the logistics. The whole staff could not been more accommodating. -;5
My daughter and I were so impressed by the very energetic and helpful receptionist, David V, that checked us in last night. He was very receptive to our request to change rooms so that we could be in a different area and we really enjoyed our stay! Highly recommend this place!;5
We stayed here for 4 days from the 7th-11th. I was definitely apprehensive about staying here because of the mixed reviews on yelp/trip advisor but we were totally pleased with our room and stay here.   First off, a lot of negative reviews center around the neighborhood, we liked it. Itâs somewhere between little Armenia and Los Feliz, so itâs not particularly touristy which we liked!! The food and shops nearby are all very reasonably priced because theyâre not inflated because of the location. Itâs also in a great spot if you want a good view of the Hollywood sign, and itâs not a far drive from the walk of fame and the more touristy areas. There are lots of great restaurants nearby within walking distance, I suggest trying some of the el Salvadoran and Mexican food in the area.;5
We had the opportunity to share a magnificent city with our children for a week. We couldnât have picked a better place to call home during our visit! Like NYC this hotel provides rich history (Take a quick stroll down the escalator). If you can appreciate how old these buildings are in NYC then you will love this place. The lobby is clean and bright. The staff is warm, inviting and friendly. They were very welcoming to our children also! We had a two room suite with two beds and a pull out couch. Our room was clean and recently updated! There were two walk in closets, I used one as my dressing room (I have three boys and this gave me great privacy). There was a fridge and, my favorite, a coffee maker. When we ran out of coffee pods and needed extra towels Staff promptly;5
Very nice conveniently located hotel minutes from everything. Having a 2 bed room was pretty decent in size when it comes to New York standards . Would definitely stay here  again . Stayed here because of a great offer thru a time share presentation. But checking regular fares the rates were still pretty affordable.;5
Stayed two days for the Halloween Horror Night event and had a wonderful time at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City. Got to watch the 18 inning World Series game in the bar area too. The staff were very helpful and the check-in and check-out was a breeze.;5
All you need to know is you will not be disappointed with your stay here. It was simply one of the most fantastic places I've EVER visited. Valentina, Jonathon, Khalid, Ismael, Wafa, and everyone else were just AMAZING! They made our stay unforgettable and can only hope I get to return one day. We didn't feel like guests there, we were treated like PEOPLE and ROYALTY. I felt like they were looking after our best interest the entire time. Our group couldn't have been more pleased with our experience. I would stay there again in a heart beat. Our Jasmine room was the perfect retreat after days in the Medina. I looked forward to coming back to the riad every night and just winding down in a piece of paradise. We were a group of friends traveling together and they really made it;5
I had a hard time finding a reasonably-priced hotel near Universal City and was so happy to get space here.  The staff was amazingly-accommodating - great breakfast and super friendly kitchen-staff.  Gisel at the front desk was sweet and very engaging. I loved the overall friendly, company culture of this locally-owned property.  And the beds??? Delicious!! Never slept so well at a hotel before!!  Highly recommended!;5
we got a beautiful room with a view of the hills. After a day in the park we enjoyed the pool and garden. We ' ve stayed at several hiltons and hilton garden inns  , but never had a breakfast so diverse ( even japanese food )  Pricy but worth it.;5
I have never before awarded 5 stars to an establishment but I am very happy to do so in this case.  This was our first visit to Morocco and the Riad Kheirredine was an outstanding place to stay for our three nights in Marrakech. The riad is located in the North-west of the Medina and ideally placed for easy access to a number of sites. Being a little way from the main square the area around the riad is quieter and easier to navigate.  The price of the room includes breakfast and a number of extra items of considerable value. It was explained to us that all soft drinks, teas and coffees were free as was the Moroccan mobile phone that we were given on the first morning. the phone is to call the riad should we have got lost. It was also used to call the hotel to ask for an escort;5
Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very accommodating -- from the amiable greeting at the hotel entrance, to housekeeping -- we had a great stay.  In particular, Annetta at the front desk was extremely helpful and nice.  She was able to adjust our shifting plans and provide us with one-on-one attention that makes our review as positive as it is.  We will be back!;5
After staying 3N/2D at a Best Western hotel in Anaheim, we were ready for a change! I'm so glad that Hilton did not disappoint!   My kids immediately noticed the difference and quality of beds, ambience and service. The beds and pillows were terrific - you are actually given 2 fluffy/soft ones and 2 hard ones per bed. Yes, take notice of the little details :) We stayed on the 17th floor facing Hollywood Fwy - it was quiet with a great view and renovated room.   If you arrive prior to check in time but would want to go to Universal, you can park in the self parking (underground). Fee for self-park is $24/day. Once you check in, the front desk will give you a parking card for in/out privileges & your parking should be valid 24 hrs from your check in time or 6pm.   It really is;5
Great view great rooftop bar. Near Lincoln center. I just wish they open breakfast at 6am . All in all. Great !!! Drinks a little pricey. Cozy lobby. Nice decor. Walking distance to Central Park and Columbus Circle and underground market;5
Emails between reservation booking and check-in were a great touch and appreciated.  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  Wonderful on the complimentary wine for our anniversary, and room assignment (top floor corner room) .. all awesome!  Room and bathroom were clean and modern.  Everything was top-notch for the reasonable price!!  Will stay again in the future and recommend!;5
The staff at this hotel is the absolute best. Everyone from Stephanie who helped with our group booking to Nancy who managed our chaotic event with such kindness to Henry at the bell station to Gabriel and the hardest working banquets staff I have ever seen and last but not least, the man himself, Abdul! I canât thank you all enough, you are all phenomenal. I was sad to give my walkie back and will miss you!;5
Had the best experience visiting the empire hotel this weekend with my girlfriends. We spent Sunday on the rooftop hotel- the best view of new york and great service by all. I highly recommend the margarita island- the perfect combo of spicy and sweet. loved our bartenders Lyonel/Amanda and manager michael went above and beyond to make sure our experience was enjoyable;5
"We enjoyed our stay very much. The gentleman that greeted us at reception was very nice and helpful.  We allowed us to upgrade at no extra charge, he gave us a room with a view of The Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. We had reserved a Queen-Bed room but he said these rooms tend to be small, so he suggested two Full beds and we were not disappointed. We were on the 8th floor. When we entered our room it was very clean and cozy. The bathroom was a bit small, but I guess this is normal for these vintage/historic hotels in the city. The street noise was of no bother to us; noise was not an issue during our stay. The lobby is beautiful and the restaurant downstairs was very good, too.";5
The Hollywood Hotel is a clean and wonderfully staffed hotel. Pil and the rest of the staff made my stay feel personal and I truly felt safe here. The covid measures were well implemented and I truly felt secure calling The Hollywood Hotel my home away from home. Thank you Pil and thank you everyone for the wonderful experience and I cant wait to see you all soon.;5
We came here a week before Christmas and was one of the best holidays ever!  The hotel has a beautiful lobby with a big Christmas tree that made us feel at home! Our rooms were modern, big enough for the two of us and very clean!  The location of this hotel is perfect it is right opposite maddison square gardens and a stone throw away from Macys/ Hooters/ Victorias Secret etc couldnât ask for a better location.  Only cons I would say is the water provided in the room is not free and you are charged id you drink it!   The next time we come to new york this is the place we will be staying thanks guys!;5
A well deserved five-star review for an outstanding five-star service. On our arrival we received a very warm welcome and immediately felt completely at home. During our whole stay the staff really went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and relaxed. When the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh got a bit too much, it was a pleasure to head back to the Riad for a jug of delicious mint lemonade and a sit on the rooftop terrace. We were genuinely sad when we had to leave the Riad and head to our next destination in Morocco. Thank you once again for a fantastic stay!;5
We were in a pickle for real. Stranded in LA since the COVID-19 hit and after 3 weeks of feeling like a nomad I was at wits end. Our apartment renovation and been halted and we had held up in Jesse's studio to respect the Stay at Home Rule.   We learned that the hotel we'd called home for 2 weeks was closing so that the staff could remain on lockdown with their families.  Now we were faced with finding  comfortable clean safe and affordable accommodations at the last minute and in the middle of a mandatory STAY@ HOME Rule. We heard NO VACANCY four times before Jesse called the property and handed me the phone. On the other end of the phone was a warm and upbeat young man. Professional positive and personable.  He told us his name was Pil. I was fighting panic and was ready to;5
Stayed from 13th - 19th December 2022 as a party of 4. Our trip was to celebrate my 40th and my fiancÃ© and I getting Married whilst in New York. I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to explain as much and request an upgrade if possible. We arrived at 14:00 and the kind reception team confirmed we had been granted an upgrade but the rooms wouldn't be ready until later in the day. We dumped our luggage, $5 per bay and went off to explore. We returned to the hotel at 17:00 to find one of the rooms was ready and the second wouldn't be ready until 22:00 (03:00 UK time). Obviously we was very tired at this point after a full day travelling. We headed out again to return at 20:00 on the off chance the second room would be ready. It wasn't but the amazing reception team offered;5
This is not just a Hilton high rise. It was a beautiful hotel including the lobby, atrium, Koi pond and rooms. We were very fortunate to get upgraded to a suite that was the most amazing suite we have ever stayed in. If you are going to Universal which was so much fun, donât waste your time on the shuttle unless you canât manage the walk. We walked there in less than 10 minutes with 2 kids. And itâs a beautiful walk. The breakfast was so international and if you just want the continental, they had plenty of choices. We upgraded every morning (kids free 12 and under) and we had custom made omelets and pancakes. The service was excellent. We enjoyed Gamil in the breakfast area and the Front Desk were super helpful and genuinely nice and patient with us. Donât consider anywhere;5
Waiting for my room to be ready, my friend and I went to the bar at the Los Angeles Hilton to kill time.  The bartender Victor was super friendly and made me an awesome drink he suggested called a Maria.  Great service!;5
Excellent location, right across from Lincoln Center.  It is worth upgrading room as the standards are quite small, expecially the bathrooms, and have courtyard views.  The city views are worth the upgrade.  Excellent restaurant and helpful staff.;5
We reserved a queen suite & asked for early check in.  When we arrived our room wasnât ready yet but we were offered another suite on the 40th floor with amazing views.  It was $75 for early check in but worth it.  The hotel is older but still well kept.  Housekeeping was great & security checked to make sure everyone had their key card which made us feel safe.  The elevators can be slow but this is a historic hotel built in 1930 that still has lots of charm.  We could walk everywhere & the subway was close.  Tik Tok restaurant was great for breakfast.  I would recommend if you want to stay central at a good price.;5
My husband and I are staying in this hotel in order to attend a funeral this weekend .  The check-in was AMAZING!  No lines and JACQUELINE was incredible !  She was professional , sweet  and she listened to our requests with a great smile . Couldnât be happier with our room also . Renovated and clean room with all the amenities we needed .  The Club level area is really nice and the breakfast was surprisingly very good !   Thanks Hyatt Regency LAX , Thanks Jacqueline !   Marvelous stay !;5
I come to NYC monthly for business. This was the first time I stayed at the Empire and I will definitely be back. A big bang for the buck. The roof top bar where you can lounge with skyscraper views and sip on delicious frozen drinks from the bar was an added plus.;5
Had a brilliant time in the New Yorker. Our room was lovely, not very big but great comfy bed and great shower. Best of all was the view,no need for us to book a skyline view of the city, we had it from our room. Sitting on the bed and looking out at the EMPIRE State Building, Crysler Building, Madison Square garden. Fabulous by day and night.  Very central hotel, across the road from Penn station, Macys is around the corner.  Will definitely stay again next time in New York.;5
The riad is beautiful laid out with two pools and lounge areas to retreat from the medina maze. The staff is super friendly and we truly felt welcome from the moment we arrived. The rooms are spacious and clean with good beds and comfortable linens. Breakfast is delicious with fresh orange juice, fruit salat, croissants and quality espresso coffee. Mineral water, tea an coffee is provided at no extra charge throuout the day.;5
I stayed here for my 30th bday. The service was amazing and the breakfast was by far the best experience I've had ever! I have to say The Chef Hugo was down right amazing.He deserves to be in a fancy restraunt. He spoke over 4 different languages when we were there and made our buffet experience very comfortable.;5
The folks at this riad are some of the nicest people I've met. More things than I can remember were complementary. Everyone always has a [genuine] smile on their face, and is happy to help out with anything that their guests might need. It really felt like staying with family instead of staying at a hotel.  Walking us out to the taxi stand [both ways] and to the main square was really something I did not expect. If I ever find myself in Marrakech, I'm staying at the Riad Kheirredine again!;5
"My husband and I stayed here for our ten year anniversary and were completely overwhelmed with the kindness and level of service in this wonderful Riad.  Our room ""Poirve"" was exceptional, cleaned twice a day, refreshed with water and beds made , then turned down for dinner, we relaxed so much here and nothing was too much trouble, we forgot our au cream and they sent someone out to get us some, we wanted breakfast on the terrace, it turns out you can eat anywhere here.  A truly romantic and magical experience, x thankyou Riad Kheirredine";5
I came here to offer my wife a small Breakout from work and to celebrate years of marriage. I am a well traveled person and I can unsure you that this Riade was one of the best places IÂ´ve ever been both for the facilities and amazing staff. The Breakfast is superb, we had always available tea, fruits, Orange Juice (so good). The SPA is very good (not fantastic but very good), a very quit place with a superb location. The Staff are always available to help and they provide us with just the right suggestions. We will came back again and to the same Riade. Special thanks to Sara and Asma. they where very helpful, nice and above all very professional. A place to be and feel like home.;5
"The location of this hotel is awesome.  Right across the street from Madison Square Garden. We were in town 1 night to see the Broadway show Chicago so the location of this hotel was perfect.  We were upgraded to a suite; which was awesome plus we were given a coupon for a free drink in the lounge while waiting for our room.  The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.";5
Wonderful stay. Had a very quiet interior room. View into a center area for A/C units but I chose the peace and quiet over looking out front and a view of the street. Right around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theater and the Late Show with Steven Colbert. Quick walk to Times Square or Central Park or Rockefeller Center. They have negotiated a fixed fare car to La Guardia Airport as an option that I found cheaper than Uber at the time - ask at the front desk. Room was clean and comfortable with nice bathroom amenities. I would stay here again.;5
Riad Kheirredine is the perfect choise if you want to visit the true Marrakesh and live the proper moroccan experience. Conveniently located in a quite corner of the Medina not far from the main square, the riad offers more than just the typical facilities that you would normally expect to find. The rooms are very confortable and exactly like you see in the pictures on the webpage, personnel is polite and professional and they do not hesitate to arrange for you anything you may like to do in Marrakesh. Food is generally good but breakfast is simply great. Behind the high walls there is litterally an oasis of peace and if you want to enjoy the moroccan sun, the riad offers you a wonderfull terrace on the rooftop where you can rest while watching a stunning view of the Atlas;5
Stayed two nights at this wonderful hotel next to Universal Studios. There was street construction going on so had to turn around a couple of times to see the hotel signs but it really is easy to get to off the 101 freeway. It has beautiful grounds and wonderful rooms and seems like all the rooms would have a great view. It was quiet in the room, extremely clean, and the bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get out of it in the morning! Didn't get a chance to use the pool or hot tub but sure looked inviting. As with any hotel, and especially in Los Angeles area food and parking was expensive, however there is a shuttle that goes right over to Universal Studios so you don't need to worry about parking there. The food was fabulous! The best part of this visit was all of the;5
The hotel was very nice.  friendly and warm staff.  made you feel very welcome.  great comfortable lobby.  bartender at hotel bar very friendly.  room was great.  small as expected as your in NYC but very nice, well decorated.  comfortable bed and loved the shower!. Will definitely come back to this hotel.;5
Been there with my wife on our anniversary. The staff was really polite and helped us through out everything we asked. Bartender was a bit arrogant,but we enjoined our stay and will definitely pay a visit again once I get the opportunity;5
The people were wonderful, the room was clean and comfortable, and everything there helped make a great weekend in Manhattan!  Checking in was very easy and having the restaurant right next to the lobby was perfect.  The art and history of the building in the lower level was very interesting and everyone should take a few minutes to see that.;5
Great value and nice place at a reasonable cost! Excellent rooms and lobby. Book and reserve with great confidence!! We spent my fiancÃ© 40th birthday here and we both decided that the best part of the trip was the hotel!!;5
We were a group of 7 celebrating 2 birthdays for our 12 and 14 year old nephews. It was the first time visiting Universal Studios for most of the family. The Hilton treated us so well by putting 2 rooms together and then comping us 7 breakfast buffets each day for our 2 day stay to make up for a Hotel water modification project that meant the water was shut off for most of the day. From check-in with the front desk to check-out, the Hilton provided a first class experience. The hotel shuttle was very convenient and a reliable way to get to and from the park.  My husband and I were the first to arrive and we settled in to the bar for happy hour while we waited on the rest of the group to arrive. Violetta was our server and she was so helpful and friendly. By the time all 7 of us;5
I have had nothing less than outstanding experiences with this hotel. The accommodations, hospitality, management,  especially  Madeline has been great. With all the terrorist threats looming, I feel very secure with lobby security always being alert to suspicious  activity.  My number one hotel in NYC!;5
We had a wonderful time at Riad Kheirredine. The staff was extremely helpful in terms of helping plan our trip/things to do, responding to any requests we had and overall service. The Riad was very clean and the food and drink service was great. The location is a bit tricky to find but the Riad had staff walk us wherever we needed to go. We had no complaints and would definitely recommend!;5
One of the best place Iâve stayed at hands down. From communication with bookings till check out. They have a clear communication and instructions by the time you arrived at the airport/parking lot. Upon check in they were warm and took time to explain and tour you around the Riad, gave recommendations and tips on what to do and not do in the area. They also give you a mobile phone with data to use with maps and calling them in case you get into some problems or troubles ( glad I didnât have to use it). Thereâs also an option to have someone escort you out and back to the riad if you are not comfortable walking by yourself to the neighborhood. The location of the Riad is just outside the souks, you have to maze around the area to get back to your place which can be intimidating;5
Great service from all staff. Exceptional service from the lovely Dania, she conducts herself like the owner of the cafe, professional, courteous, confident. She made me and my family feel very important to her. Exceptional service from our waiter Santos V. When I inquired I found out heâs a bus boy?! He was filling in for a waiter who was too busy to bother with us? Santiago V customer service skills are Wasted as a bus boy! We will be returning to Hilton soon, I sure hope I see him as my full time waiter when we return you cannot teach his personality that is made for interacting with people, he will assure returning guests. Please send my thanks to these two exceptional employees who made out stay much better than it had been turning out! I mean it! Thank you! Thomas;5
We resevered the suite on 38th floor, very nice two baths one bedroom but a sofa bed in living room. This gave my wife and I privacy in bedroom and a private bath while our granddaughter had her own bath. Gtreat view, clean room. The subway was close and Sal pizza was just a short walk they have been open since the 60s. It was a great location with close subway and time sq. I would highly recommend this suite if you want a privacy for two parties staying in same room. Very one at hotel was friendly and helpful. The tiC tock room had a very good breakfast.;5
Jerome, thank you so much for the amazing service. Jerome helped us with an early check in, got us in a great room overlooking the park and was just a generally nice guy to work with. Thanks again Jerome!;5
We stayed here for 4 nights with my husband. Location is excellent, easy walk to metro station, the room was so clean, bed was so comfy, staff are excellent. We loved this hotel. Laundry services available in the first floor and housekeeping did an excellent job as well. There was also Fresh Breakfast EVERY Morning. The breakfast ladies are amazing, especially to Miss Sonia, we appreciate your kindness. She is a very nice person and always happy and ready if you need anything. Would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers for safe,cheap and comfortable hotel.  Thank you trip advisor reviewers!;5
I honestly couldn't recommend this place enough. My boyfriend and I stayed in one of the Captain's Cabins rooms for our first trip to New York and were instantly won over by the welcoming staff and the charm of the building itself.   I can potentially see the heating/cooling of the rooms being a problem, due simply to the building's age, but the staff are more than happy to make you comfortable. We said we were a bit cold (NY has been suffering extremely cold weather!) and within minutes we had been provided with a space heater and an extra blanket which sorted us out.   It's 30 minutes from Times Square, but the local area is far nicer in my opinion, being close by to great bars and restaurants and the Bleecker Street area - perfect for going to see a gig or a comedy show. If;5
Overall everything. Was great.  I was there for meetings with several clients. The staff was wonderful, some exceptional, especially Heather in the lobby lounge. My clients even commented on the level of professionalism this young lady delivered   I will definitely return to the Empire Hotel;5
This is most important in this hotel any one go to hear because it's so nice and safety.And any members of this hotel manage their customers like receptly until check out also after that so I like it very much;5
Couldn't praise every member of staff highly enough. Extremely obliging. Fantastic value. Perfect location. Rooms spacious and spotless. Great security. Great advice on tours etc. Doormen super friendly. An amazing experience.;5
check in was swift and pleasant  , pool area lovely  all staff helpful great location for theme park  bar drinks in hotel were overpriced  there were some issues with the lifts but nothing major shuttle buses very efficient  will be returning someday;5
From the very beginning, our experience with this riad was amazing. Upon arrival, we were given cool cloths and light snacks and when the staff found out that the airline had lost my bag, they were quick to get in touch with the airport for me and have a staff member escort us to a market where I could buy clothes to last me until my bag was found. Our suite was absolutely beautiful - this riad is truly a hidden gem.   We had both breakfast and lunch here, and the food was delicious. The staff is beyond attentive - we felt more like family than guests. Anything we needed was provided, and then some. The riad confirmed all of our reservations and was happy to call taxis for us and walk us wherever we needed to go. We made full use of the escorts offered and the provided cell;5
My 12 year old daughter and I decided to head to NYC last minute during April Vacation.  I booked the Wyndham New Yorker hotel and was very happy, the rooms were small but very clean and was perfect for us.  Location was within walking distance to everything we wanted to do, Times Square, Theater District and Central Park (that was a little bit of a walk to Central Park but we did it)   There are 2 restaurants on site, we only ate at the 24hr Diner not the Italian place but the diner was very good.  We had a great time and will absolutly consider this hotel again next time we are planning a trip to NYC;5
I have literally left for the airport home as I write this, but felt compelled to write a completely honest view for our stay.  If you read the many reviews on here with lots of negative comments, then please take them with the tiniest grain of salt.  This is a great hotel. The only very very minor gripe I have was when we first arrived we were asked to have breakfast at another Wyndham run property, which they offered $200 if we attended. Wasnât interested,but thought it was a bit much considering we had only been in the hotel for a few minutes.  However that was only only minor thing I would say. I quickly forgot about it and got on with my holiday.  The hotel staff are mostly very polite and attentive, and would do whatever they could to help you. I have read some reviews;5
Sophy got me all checked in and was very helpful! The room was clean, very cold AC, pool on the roof top is nice with outdoor lounge. Very short walk to Central Park. This was my first time here and really enjoyed my stay. I would definitely stay here again!;5
Outstanding experience from start to finish. Make sure to visit the lobby lounge bar and see Gerard or Frank for a drink. Ambience is great, location is as good as it gets, the room was clean and comfortable. Will definitely be returning to this sweet spot!;5
Enjoyable stay at the Ameritania. The hotel is located on the corner of Broadway just a few blocks from Times Square and Central Park. The reception area is bright and welcoming with free WiFi and coffee and tea in the mornings. The staff were all friendly (which is not always the case in NYC), particularly Geoff whoâs recommendations for places to eat were spot on. The rooms were big enough for a few days stay, but there was no storage space other than the hangers in the cupboard - no drawers for t shirts etc. Also the aircon unit was very noisy so we could not leave it on at night. Overall a good place to stay in New York. Reasonably priced and a great location.;5
Riad Kheirredine really is, as other reviewers have said, an amazing oasis of tranquility in the madness of the Medina. There is little more I can add to the comments made by others. Courtesy mobile phone, complimentary mint tea with biscuits/pastries and the offer of bottled water whenever you want...... as well as a stunning roof terrace, great breakfasts and lovely rooms. All this adds up to a wonderful place to stay.;5
My wife and I stayed at Hilton Universal City from 12-16 September 2012 and loved the room (2162) very much. Room was spacious and all amenities expected were provided. Bed was very comfortable. Being a Hilton Honors member was given breakfast coupons everyday where continental breakfast was provided free (upgrade to full buffet for another US$9) Buffet breakfast was substantial and well worth the upgrade if you plan not to have lunch. Internet is provided free in the lobby and cafe 1 hour a day. Sufficient for simple email checking and quick surfing. Printing of boarding passes was free.  For those whose main objective is Universal Studios this is one of best places to stay. It allows you to fully appreciate and utilize the time at Universal Studios and Citywalk. There is a;5
I had tickets for a concert at MSG. We decided to stay close by to avoid traveling late at night.  The hotel was beautiful! We arrived a little early and our room wasn't ready, but we were given a king size bed in a room with a private terrace, and as if ordered special, we experienced a snow squall from the 30th floor....True Christmas in NYC.  Convienient to everything, Nice restaurant within the hotel, a 24 hour diner (Tick-Tock Diner of Sopranno's fame) on premise for late night meal after a show.  Just beautiful!!!  Sorry our stay was just  one night.;5
Staff is very nice. Let them know if there is any problem. They will solve it. They changed my room.   Location is very convenient.   The small is really small though, not good for a couple, lower price though of you are traveling alone.;5
The Jane suited me perfectly. All I wanted was a room to crash and store my shopping as I wasn't planning to spend a lot of time in my room. It was tiny but plenty of storage which was designed creatively.   Cafe Gitane downstairs served fabulous food and the citron presse was DELICIOUS!   Each time I left and returned, I was greeted with in a friendly manner and on the whole, I was extremely pleased with my stay. Will I return? Hell, yes!  I read some of the negative comments but I honestly think the reviewer's expectations may have been somewhat unrealistic. That said, my friend arrived and had to book the Captain's room as the hotel was fully booked. I found it roomy and spacious, with a fantastic view. The air-conditioning worked and the room was truly well-lit. Not sure if;5
This would be like a time-travel to the past with its old, classic and vintage architecture, great location in the middle of the City, walking distance to Madison Square Garden, simply a great stay and affordable as a bonus. I would recommend it with only compliments.;5
Very clean, comfortable for a quick layover and I mean quick for us.......probably about 8 hrs.  The check in was quite efficient and the front desk agent was very friendly and efficient.  The room was a King on the 8th floor, very clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated, ample space with a fully stocked bathroom.  The restaurant seemed to be very nice and the menu looked great, lounge looked very nice.  Full room service menu that I wish we had time to take advantage of.;5
This was my first time visiting NYC and it was for business. The night manager Dan was extrodinarly helpful with guiding me through the city. I highly recommend this hotel for its expertise in customer service and amazing accommodations!;5
Having read a few bad reviews on this site about the Empire Hotel and now having had THE best hotel experience I've ever had...and I've traveled I felt I must rite this!... First of all the hotel is beautiful, it is Art Deco and classy and Is in a perfect location... Close to everything but not Bang in the middle of the hustle and bustle of this amazing city!!... Secondly the staff at the hotel are fantastic.... Especially Chris on the concierge ... This guy is brilliant at his job.. Nothing is too much hassle he on a number of occasions pointed us to restaurants which where lovely... And on one occasion even got us into one which was booked up according to the web page till February... the same night! Which made my girlfriend very happy. Can not give him enough credit!... (If;5
Just back from another stay at the Empire. This time, we had a Junior Suite. It was very spacious with nice views. We've been staying at the Empire for several years now and highly recommend it. The location is perfect â across from Lincoln Center. There is also a TKTS booth just steps away to get theater tickets. Also, a goof selection of restaurants and Central Park is just a block away.;5
If you are visiting Hollywood and Universal Studios, this Hotel is the only one to use.  Ease of getting there, very short walking distance to Universal Studios,  and all the needs of a family on vacation.  Rooms are clean, quiet, and good size, and the staff is the most helpful I've experienced in the US.  The restaurant is good with an excellent, varied menu.  I was impressed!;5
Hyatt shuttles are absolutely the most frequent shuttle at LAX. I usually never have to wait more than 5 minutes. And now that Uber, Lyft and regular taxis are not even picking up at the terminals anymore, it's sort of a no brainer.   Hotel staff is great too. I left something in the room before and Joy, the concierge, was able to FedEx it back to me. She has also helped keep parcels which are mailed to the hotel so I can pick them up when I arrive.   I usually fly in from Asia and after a 12-14 hour flight, front desk staff like Megan has helped me check in early or if rooms were not available let me relax at the club until a room was ready.   Even the staff at breakfast and the 24-hour cafe are all super nice.   One tip: if you need extra water, the gym on the top floor will;5
We had an amazing stay at Riad Kheirredine. The staff were all so friendly and always there to help. The food was excellent, we really enjoyed breakfast and dinner on the roof top every day! Our room was great and very clean and the turn down service in the evening was a lovely touch. The location of the Riad is great and within walking distance to the main square and medina.  Overall we were really impressed with the Riad and would definitely recommend to friends and family.;5
My and my wife stayed there for a week during our anniversary trip and we were very satisfied with the hotel. Great location- walking distance from restaurants, clubs grocery stores etc... We really enjoyed the property itself with beautiful gardens, sauna and nice little pool too. On top of all that the staff was great too. Everybody was helpful, smiling and super friendly, no matter how many times we forgot our room key. Ellias on the front desk was great. Thank you guys, we know where we are staying next trip to LA.;5
Came in super late with my friends Mr Pil walked us in into 2 rooms after we couldnât booked online. From the time we walked in and the patience he had with us we thank him with all our blessing.   Once in the rooms we got comfortable In our big queen beds and enjoyed being of our feet.  Thank for all your service and thank you for all the help.;5
That's about the only thing the fine people didn't do for me in our 3 night stay here. Their level of thought and care has been exceptional and made our first visit to Marrakesh a great one. Read the other reviews for all the specifics of the room and facilities etc....I'd only duplicate them. I'm pretty fussy with rating hotels but I can honestly give this one an excellent rating.;5
The Ameritania Hotel is in a great location. We enjoyed a drink at the bar before heading up to a comfortable room. The bed was comfortable, the big rain shower was great after a long day. We will most differently return when we travel back to NYC.;5
Stayed overnight for an early flight to Hawaii, everything was great. Close to airport and had shuttle service. Room was better than expect. Would stay again. In and Out about a mile away took an uber for $6 round trip!;5
Don't pay the high prices at the restaurant when you can go up to City Walk and find better food at lower prices. I paid $100.00 for breakfast for two children and one adult. I was flabbergasted. Other than the outrageous prices at the restaurant, the hotel staff and accommodations were wonderful.;5
Italian run, very stylish place and very helpful people.  Only place Iâve been to where the rooms are made twice a day, and the bedding was incredibly comfortable.  The terrace is gorgeous and I loved just lazing around there before heading out.  Best breakfasts Iâd had in Morocco, loads of delicious food laid out, I scoffed the lot every time.  Dinner was excellent as well.  Tricky place to find but they put a lot of effort into helping you out so not a problem, and smartphones locate you anyway.  Definitely go here.;5
We have stayed in many hotels across the world, and we can honestly say we have never stayed at a place with better service than the staff at Riad Kheirredine is providing. The friendly staff is taking care of you, letâs you enjoy all the best Marrakesh has to offer without having to worry about anything. Everyone at Riad Kheirredine makes you feel special and wants to make sure that you can relax. Delicious breakfast in the lounge areas on the rooftop, unlimited fresh orange juice, fruits and water, excellent Moroccan diner are just some of the highlights. What really sticks out is that you receive a phone upon arrival to use during your stay through which you can ask the staff just about anything to arrange for you, as if you have a personal assistant taking care of you.;5
We have a really pleasant stay, thanks for receptionist vlad! Love our big room and beds. Hotel was a perfect location for young adults. Air condition work well, and the city noises dont bother us. There is so many pillow and towels. Clean is everyday;5
We were going to a cousin's funeral a month before our planned trip to St. Maarten we wanted an affordable hotel in the city.  Lucky for us Empire Hotel offered 25% which we booked and loved the location, the room, the customer services from the doormen, check in person, elevator person to the rooftop bar (views were amazing).  At checkout my husband left his wallet in the room the room cleaner turned his wallet into the security guard so grateful.  We stayed for two nights, parked at ICON garage with hotel validation we received $15 discount.  We will definitely stay there again discounted or not.;5
After being stuck in LA due to IRENE the one bright spot was the super service we recieved from the front desk attendant STUART GOMEZ.. He was able to extend our stay, calmed our concerns about getting out and was helpful with just about every aspect of out extended stay. The Hilton needs more people like Mr Gomez who is obviously trained and exceeds all expecatations. The night staff there could learn from him. If you need anything while there...go see Mr GOMEZ he will make your trip worthwhile and the HILTON should be proud.;5
Stayed here  while I was on a business trip and I loved it. Was my first time in Los Angeles, staff was helpful in suggesting places to go and gave me flyers  Modern, airy, spacious facilities. Conveniently close to the airport and local food places. Staff were very courteous and helpful;5
Nice stay, nice bedrooms, restaurants nearby, Starbucks and McDonalds in front of the hotel, nice cafeteria, nice bistro, etc., etc.   Hot shower, friendly hosts, nice attention, very good people. You and your family will guarantied enjoy.;5
"Bottom line: This Riad has out-serviced MANY 5 start hotels I've been to in the States, hands down.  If you are looking for impeccable service, delicious food (their chef is THE BEST!), attention to detail, beautiful surroundings, supportive staff, this is your place. We stayed here for our first visit to Morocco. We were greeted warmly with a fresh meal and moist cloths, the GM met us on our first day and welcomed us. We enjoyed a meal while the office checked us in. Thereafter, we got a tour of this incredible resort (the pictures do NOT do this place justice), and we arranged our excursions for the week (the sunrise hot air balloon ride is a MUST!). I stayed at a second Riad during our visit to Marrakech and IMMEDIATELY regretted it. I booked two just to ""get a feel"" for what";5
"We had an amazing stay here. The experience started before we arrived - with quick responses to questions sent by email.  After a smooth transfer from the airport, dinner was arranged for us on the first night as we had a late arrival - which was delicious and ended with a birthday cake!  We also had a lovely decorated room for our anniversary  - another lovely surprise.  Throughout the whole stay we were looked after with a personal touch including: day trip booked at the last minute with a great guide; excellent restaurant recommendations and we were escorted to various locations (mostly by Karim and - even one time when he had already finished work-thank you!) so we didn't get lost.  Everywhere was very clean with gorgeous decoration. The roof terrace is large with good";5
This Riad was the epitome of luxury and high class service. The location was excellent in relation to the Medina but the Riad itself is an absolute gem within it. The service is highly personalised - they cannot do enough for you and every item in the hotel exudes beauty and class. Food was outstanding with a strong wine list. All round an excellent location to unwind for a long weekend.;5
My 75 year old mother just stayed at Riad Kherridine and could not say more positive things about the service she received.  Staff was incredibly helpful...went completely above and beyond, helping her work through travel changes, find trustworthy shops, etc.   Rooms and food were evidently terrific.;5
I like the hotel location and we literally walked everywhere. Icon places are within a mile. You can see the Empire State from the hotel. Madison Square Garden is just across the street. Macy's is on the same street. Time Square, Broadway and more. Look for Mohammad if you are checking in. He is a very good guy.;5
Everyone is super friendly here! Which is huge for me, as I am from the Midwest! Algenis checked me in and was super nice and accommodating! I forgot my name twice (it's been a long work / travel day) and he didn't even judge me. He was quick and went over my expectations of what I'd find in a NYC hotel. Would stay here again. Oh, rooms are super nice and clean too!;5
My boyfriend and I stayed one night at this hotel because my best friend's wedding reception was held here. I'm originally from the LA area, so I never stayed in a hotel near Universal City. I was impressed by the quality of the room, and the comfort of the bed and pillows. We didn't have a view since we were on the lobby level, but my friend's bridal suite had a fantastic view, and was fairly big. Ballroom was also very spacious and the food was excellent (Chinese buffet-style).;5
We visited here for 6 nights and it was great. Pil on the front desk was very helpful, as were all the staff. It is located between two metro stations. The price includes breakfast and there is also a bar in the basement. The location is good for getting around. We had a great time there.;5
Everything about my stay was perfect! Great location to everything. Decent size room, Perfect view, clean, cozy. They brought up extra toiletries with no hassle. Tik tok was convenient and great food. Lobby was beautiful. I am in love with this hotel!;5
Brilliant location - 10/10. 5 minutes to Central Park one way 5 minutes to Times Square, Empire State etc the other.  Subway 2 minutes away, so able to get around very easily. Staff are very helpful and hotel is modern and clean.;5
Every aspect of stay was top notch ,including friendliness and efficiency of front desk,  decor and condition of lobby, good elevators, spaciousness of room (by NYC standards), quality of bedding and linens, and location. One of the best hotel values in NYC.;5
Short walk to the airport, grocery store, Target, and restaurants. The restaurant and bar donât disappoint. The lobby and rooms are beautiful, and the exercise room is excellent, with lots of natural light and beautiful views of the airport.;5
The hotel is the best and pil is too. Come from Japan and Hollywood is the best. Hotel is near all things do do driving. The rooms are big and good view inside. Pool and gym are good too I like to stay longer;5
This hotel has been a part of the LAX landscape and the Hyatt family for many years. With an older hotel, the updating can be limited by the architecture. And my experience has been that often airport hotels start to get a little tired because of their nearly captive audience and the cost of staying current.  That was not the case with the Hyatt LAX. This was as attractive and business AND people friendly as a freshly designed and built hotel. Our room was fresh, quiet, and roomy. It contained comfortable bedding, a very large flat screen TV, and was quiet to the point I could hardly believe that we were adjacent to one of the world's busiest airports. The bathtubs have been replaced by roomy showers. There was plenty of water pressure for a wonderful shower and plenty of thick;5
"We stay in this hotel when we visit Universal Studios. It is pricey, but it is a high-quality hotel.  It is better to be a ""Hilton Honors Member"" as they have a shorter check in line.  The staff here is great and always waiting to assist you, but you will be handing out tips like candy.  The room was average size, high quality beds, sheets, towels. The room has 3 phones and nice furniture, and a room safe. They have HBO, and most kids channels. They have a nice shuttle every 30 minutes to Universal Studios. This saves you parking fees at the studio, but you do pay to park at the Hilton. $10 to $16 a day to park in fact.  The resteraunt and room service are very expensive though, typical for a Hilton. There is a also a Sheraton that is next to Universal Studios, but that Hotel is";5
Came here with 4 friends for a weekend of relaxation and we couldn't have had a better experience (1) excellent staff service, (2) beautiful rooms and (3) fantastic food. The whole trip was such a great opportunity to relax and enjoy Marrakech;5
I can recommend this Riad without any concerns. In all we stayed there for 4 nights. The staff is extremely well organized, i.e. transfers (from airport etc.), guided visits are also on time. Appeasingly, the staff really cares about their guests. You get a cell phone with a local number, you can call somebody from the Riad and they will come to help you.  Besides, the Riad itself is a dream: courtyard is such a nice garden, the rooms are furnished very nicely. In addition, break fast and dinner are really good. All in all, the perfect place in Marrakech!;5
Check out The Smith (amazing Eggs Benedict!), Burrito Box (quality takeout!), and enjoy 3 days of art at the Met for just $25! We saw a concert at the Beacon Theater and the Empire was the perfect place to stay!;5
"I can't say enough about how wonderful my stay is.  Mohammed helped check me in. As a Wyndham Rewards member they have a special desk and you actually sit down while Mohammed checks you in.  What an amazing person!  He was hospitable, kind, and got me into a room as quickly as possible.  I happened to mention being on a higher floor.  Was I shocked to be put on the 39th floor with an amazing view of the Empire State building. The refrigerator had sodas and water in it.  After I was in the room about 10 minutes, Mohammed phoned to inquire if everything was satisfactory.  Believe me, as a person whose on the road a lot, this kind of attention is unheard of.  I asked about the drinks in the refrigerator and his response was ""They are from me to make your stay more enjoyable"".  Wow.";5
"Great hotel with the ideal location especially for bus or train travellers. Located within easy walking distance from both Port Authority and Penn Station, this hotel is also near various subway lines, making it simple to get around the city. The rooms are very clean and nicely renovated with good space and the lobby is impressive. The employees are pleasant and there was sufficient staff at all times that there wasn't an unbelievable wait for anything; check-in, check-out, information, assistance. Our room had amazing views of the skyline and there were plenty of windows so you could see plenty of it. We would definitely return to the New Yorker when we are next in the city and we recommend it to anyone who wants a clean, inviting room with easy access to mutiple travel options.";5
When you stay at the Universal Hilton, your experience should always be top-notch. Over the last many years, for business and for pleasure, this is always my go-to hotel when in Hollywood. It is the perfect location to Universal Studios (an easy walk) and close to several other amenities. The staff is always professional, courteous, and helpful. The hotel looks great inside and out and virtually any room gives you a great view in any direction. And above all (perhaps most importantly), the rooms are spotless and spacious.;5
Went with college to this great hotel in a fantastic location, only to find the best hotel employee iâve ever encountered, the man gave me a cup of tea on my last day because we were all tired and sad to be going, heâs a legend that I hope to meet again, LONG LIVE JEFFREY!;5
The Hyatt are an outstanding facility and accommodated for our son who is wheelchair we could not thank them enough for assisting our family  we were consistently experiencing the warmest and most professional service. Highly recommend the Hyatt for families who are requiring special assistance with an affordable price with that special luxury  Thank you so much to all the beautiful Hyatt staff;5
My husband and I loved our stay here, it was charming and unforgettable. We have high standards wherever we go, wanting to experience the best a location has to offer, while also respecting the culture and customs of wherever we are visiting.  I had a tight schedule and despite a few last minute changes, the staff booked everything as asked. The staff anticipated our needs and took care of us by providing valuable advice that I knew I wouldn't get from anywhere else. During the hot air balloon booking, they even reminded me of my own allergies!  Staying in a gorgeously designed riad with great amenities and privacy was a given from the photos. The riad also has the best rooftop terraces the area has to offer. What distinguishes this riad from others is having the service highly;5
Recently renovated, this is a modern, stylish property, located virtually on top of LAXâs north take off/landing strip. A helpful, friendly staff complements the good facilities - excellent lobby bar with a nice ambience, better than average gym and, but for its location downwind from the rev-up/take off point, an outstanding outdoor pool. Located just by the signature light towers at the airport entrance, the Hyatt enables you to watch from your room as the incoming flights parade silently by. The hotelâs Unity restaurant features a decent menu and competently-prepared dishes. A plus is the 24 hour food bar in the lobby. The hotelâs flaws are relatively minor - the carpet in my room was in need of cleaning, the AC system both noisy and unable to go lower than 68. I called about;5
Here on business. The staff is so accommodating, so genuinely nice and service oriented. I appreciated seeing managers jump in and help- the buffet was spotless and delicious. The shuttle was so convenient. We needed several different things and each need was met with grace and a true sense of helping us- from using the business center to having to park in the front of the hotel due to an event. It was perfectly balanced for all the business and families. Truly would recommend. Kudos the the staff who must be tired but youâd never know. Never saw an eye roll, attitude, or an appearance of stress. These people deserve BIG Kudos!;5
We stayed here during our honeymoon . We was checked in by a gentleman called Miguel . Very nice and helpful.  We was upgraded to the 36th floor as we was on honeymoon we had a fab room with a view ! We offered complimentary wine as gift but as we don't drink we was given breakfast vouchers as a honeymoon gift , this was lovely . Tick tock cafe attached is great , great location, yes rooms are small but who stays in tneir in rooms! Tne gym was great , we used this , staff were friendly, we would stay , Thankyou New Yorker and Miguel too :);5
The Hotel is beautiful, the staff Mariana and Michelene were very nice and friendly. The rooftop was a lot of fun =) The pool too small but nice set up. The overall experience was excellent.;5
Wonderful staff and service.  Top five things - the freshly squeezed orange juice, the cashmere bedding, the friendly staff, drinking wine on the terrace and the mobile phone provided in case of emergencies.  There are many other wonderful things to say which all the other reviewers have covered.  We'll definitely be back again this year...;5
Me and my partner stayed here for 4 nights last week and very much enjoyed it, the location is great for a city break maddison sq garden is across the Rd and lots of the NYC must do's such as empire state, rockafella, macys, time square and Broadway are just a 5-10 min walk away, we found the hotel and room very clean with a 1930s art deco feel to it, we found all the staff very helpful and polite the only negative point was the compulsory $22 a day charge for the facilities regardless of if u wanted to use them or not but seen as we had paid we made the most of the WiFi in the room and the unlimited international calls;5
When I booked a reservation for my recent biz trip to Manhattan, being frugal I picked the least expensive reservation I could find...so I booked three nights at the Empire Hotel steps from Broadway at 63rd st.  Not knowing NYC at all, I figured I was in a bad neighborhood or something when the daily rate (with a senior discount) was only $103. a night.  WELL, when I got there I was blown away...it was a GREAT older hotel, with a totally pleasant and efficient staff and concierge (who was very helpful, I was compelled to tip him $20.00 for his great service...his name was Yuri.)  You cannot beat this deal for the location...Anyone who wants a GREAT location, with a Starbucks around the corner, and a great medium priced quality atmosphere restaurants such as the clark and The;5
Excellent hotel with very good breakfast, especially the omelets made by Hugo and Ana were deliciious! The location is perfect and the beds are very good. No complaints! I will be back when i am in Los Angeles again.;5
During my time in the beautiful city of Marrakech, I was lucky enough to stay at the incredible Riad Kheirredine.  Nestled in the bustling streets of the medina, around 15 minutes from Djemaa El Fna, Riad Kheirredine is an exceptional riad marked by several exquisite open-air courtyards, gorgeous traditional Moroccan designs and the most friendly staff ever.  Add to that their mouth-watering cuisine, an outdoor pool with a sun terrace, and tailored-fit assistance throughout your entire stay, and it is safe to say that Riad Kheirredine is among the absolute best riads in Marrakech!   Riad Kheirredine truly made my time in Marrakech one to remember!;5
My husband and I stayed at The Jane Hotel in May 2016. We could not fault this hotel,it was in a lovely location. The staff were amazing, extremely helpful and friendly. Cafe Gitane again was excellent also with very friendly and helpful staff. The food was fantastic as well. We stayed in a bunk bed room and although very small was more than adequate. As far as storage goes these rooms are so well thought out. My husband and I don't travel light and this was the first week of a three week trip to America. I managed to unpack all our clothes (a lot of them, I had about six pairs of shoes) and fit them in the drawers under the bed. There is a long hanging rail which more than accommodated all our hanging clothes, plus the ones we bought whilst in New York. You do need to pack your;5
My sister and I stayed there for 4 nights and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. They were happy for us to have the room a little longer on our last day at no extra charge. The doorman booked us a car to take us back to JFK which cost less that the cab.  Would definitely stay there again.;5
We stayed at this hotel recently and were very impressed by the large, clean and modern room as well as the excellent service from staff. We also ate at the restaurant and ordered room service, which were great food served with prompt and polite service. Check out was smooth and the hotel was happy to hold our luggage for many hours while we shopped and then waited for our late night flight. The shutttle bus to the airport was free and ran regularly. On top of all these positives, the front office manager, Christian Robinson went over and above the call of duty when we realised that we had forgotten a piece of our luggage but didnât have time to make a return trip from then airport to the hotel in time to catch our flight. Christian personally and promptly delivered the;5
First time staying at this hotel and was very pleased overall. The hotel is staff is very nice and accommodating.My room was on the 17th floor and had a great view of Universal City Studios Theme Park and the surrounding area. Since I drove a vehicle, I had to Valet park my vehicle which costs $40.00 per day+ any gratuity. Once checked in, there is a complimentary shuttle that runs approx. every 10 minutes that will take you from the hotel to Universal Studios Citywalk  which is next to the theme park. You can also just walk to the theme park from the hotel which will take you only about 5-10 minutes. The hotel has a breakfast buffet in the mornings, but beware that on the weekends it costs $28.00. The food is very good with a good variety of breakfast selections. The hotel does;5
"Our hotel room was very nice and cleaned everyday. Bed sheets and towells changed daily, as long as you don't put out the ""do not disturb sign"".  The subway train just around the corner bye far the cheapest mode of transport to visit other stats of New York.  If your good at walking then do so.  You can easily walk to Central Park and just keep going to Times Square.  Lots of  nearby places to eat and drink all good value for money.  Aviod the Yellow cabs unless your rich.  If you'r on your own or a couple book the airport travel through the hotel.  The whole hotel was very nice including the lifts, you wouldn't want to climb the stairs everyday.  The hotel staff were were great.  If a great location downtown is what you seek , save up and go next year.  From the hotel we walked";5
Very nice hotel near to airport. Friendly and very supportive staff. Good room nice view and very spacious. Outstanding hotel at great price. Pure value for money. Good food as well. Over all very very happy with all facilities. If any one visiting to Los Angeles I highly recommend this hotel for stay.;5
Spent five nights here and could not fault it. Rooms are small but very clean and the shower and bath a godsend in the cold weather. Staff are helpful and it's a relaxed atmosphere in lobby. Great location opposite Madison Sq Garden, definitely recommend.;5
In a great location near Times Square. Upon arrival at 11, they checked me in to my room with no early check-in request. Also upgraded my room with no request or charge added. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Always a clean room. Would recommend this hotel to friends/family. Greater than expected!;5
Pil, what great was able to meet all my needs with great customer services, with a great attitude!! Gave me everything I ask for to suit me and my family. I will be returning for a stay at Holly Wood Hotels!!;5
NEW YORKER HOTEL IS GOOD FOR TRAVELERS WHO ARE SEARCHING FAST AND PLEASURE ATENTION.  Great location.      Great security staff.  If you are traveling from Latin American countries and you feel confortable speaking spanish this hotel is the right place.;5
Clean, nice staff, close to hollywood studio. Parking cost is high at almost 50 Dollar a day. The overall cost would always be preferred to be lower but nonetheless remains competitive to similar type of hotels.   I'm pleased with the hotel.;5
On the plane home from a delightful stay at Riad Kheirredine. As we arrived after a hard couple of days trekking Mount Toubkal. We were met at the taxi drop of by two porters who escorted us and luggage to the Riad. As with most riads, Iâve stayed in a few, the entrance was unassuming but as you entered it was like entering into another world of calm. Marrakesh can be a bit hectic at times, but this was the absolute antidote. We were served some mint tea and got a full tour and briefing as what to expect.  Everywhere is looking newly decorated and loads of terraces, patios etc. (It is a very large Riad and they are currently making it even bigger, although I could not hear any building works during the stay). We were the shown to our Suite, Verveine(hopefully correct spelling),;5
We spent 2 nights at the Ameritranian NY, 54th & Broadway. With classie rooms & a shower to fit the family in, you could hardly want for a better location. Central Park, Times Square & a host of theatres & places to eat on the door step, it's a great place to stay.  I would definitely recommend it.;5
Very good location. One block from Penn Station and two drug stores (duane read/walgreens and CVS) , Starbucks around the corner, Close to Empire State. Close to Mid-Town. You can get to many places for a $10 cab ride. The hotel staff was very nice and polite, professional.   I had a room with some plumbing and air condition problems. Told the front desk and immediately they gave me another room and offered to move my luggage. The new room was very nice and clean. The room was small, but efficient.  This is not a hotel if you plan to camp out in the room. The restaurant has good food and friendly service. If you plan to stay there in the near future, try the William Hill chardonnay. Bottomline, I would stay there again.  I have traveled all over the world and United States for;5
I stayed here for a night to attend a graduation at the Lincoln Center. We arrived too early to check in, but when I explained that we had a graduation to attend in 2 hours they were able to find a room so we could get ready. Check out the roof type. It's amazing and fun. We were able to quickly change and head upstairs to have a bite to eat before heading next door. I loved everything about The Empire Hotel and would stay there again. The only negative was the price of the hotel, but I found that to be true everywhere we  looked for that night. It seemed prices were high because of all the college graduations happening.;5
Awesome property and staff, with easy walk to Universal Studios!  Amazing room view, and it was clean and spacious.  Parking is available until 6pm the next day, which helps if youâre visiting the studios.  We will be back.;5
Travelling with a 9 month old baby is always challengin, but when going to the city we didnt factor in the street noise that proves this city never sleeps. Originally assigned a room on the 3rd floor but after that 1st night when the baby didnt really sleep we asked if we could be moved up at all. The staff was extremly helpful and was able to accomidate out reqeust and move all of our luggage for us while we were out exploring the city.  The location is perfect, close to all of the major tourist attractions but not not right ontop of them. Just above Times Square and the theater district, just below the park and columbis cicrcle 1 avenue over from Hells Kitchen and a short walk from Rockefeller area. Beds were comfortable if you enjoy a nice soft bed then you will be in heaven.;5
Great hotel great location, spoke to Kevin in the restaurant he was a great server credit to the company.. we asked his advice on best beach to visit in area, and we went there had a great day.., appreciate your help Kevin. Room was spacious airport view which was fun.;5
Family vacation to Universal Studios, Dodgers baseball, and other Los Angeles attractions.  The Hilton was a great location, the staff was very friendly, and the accommodations were excellent. I recommend this hotel highly.;5
I loved the hotel.They went out of their way to get us an early check in. Our flight takeoff time was 6am, so we were a little tired around 1pm. They got our room ready around 1:30pm. The check in staff were so polite and caring. Jeff the doorman was unbelievably kind. He hailed our taxi's and gave us recommendations on food and shopping.  We were very pleased with our stay and will stay there again in the future. Grat location and plenty to do just outside the doors. Thank you for taking care of us;5
Nice and communicative staff, solid architecture. Jose, Hugo and the lady from kitchen made my day, with their smile and forthcoming attitude. The room service managed to clean and prepare our room, before we could return from the breakfast - I have never experienced such speed and precision before.;5
Great hotel in Los Angeles, definitely a hit spot for day to day travel Wonderful pool big patio to chill with friends must visit to see. Do ask for rooms that are updated you wonât regret it.  Shout to Pil who made sure our stay was great! Thank you;5
Beautiful room with all the required amenities and fantastic service. Staff is very friendly and takes care of your needs very well. Shuttle service to and from Airport is very convenient as well. Breakfast and meal options were great.;5
Excellent hotel with excellent staff!! We booked only one night but my family liked the room and the location so much that we stayed another night. Front desk staff were very helpful. Housekeeping staff as well very accommodating to our needs. The only thing I did not find satisfactory are the pillows, they were too thin and flat for me but the beddings and bed are good. We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area.;5
The hotel is in a great location - especially if you goto JFK or Newark by train as Penn station is on the corner.   I sadly booked the wrong night and we found out when I turned up. Thankfully Mohammad at reception was able to find a solution for us. He was really professional and empathetic - this is hard to find at the moment as so many hotels are understaffed. We did have to book the accommodation again but he was quick in finding a fair solution. A big thanks to Mohammad.   The room was standard, clean and ok the small size but this is quite normal for New York City. We had a great view over midtown and the diner downstairs was great for breakfast.  We would recommend this hotel and stay at again.;5
Absolutely loved our stay at the Empire Hotel. Don't listen to the negative reviews, they must have never stayed in a hotel before! We had a great time. Room was comfortable and clean, amazing view, perfect size (yes the bathroom is small but how much time do you REALLY spend in there?!).  This hotel is the perfect location for everything. Close enough walking or quick subway ride distance to everything you want to do. Lincoln center is directly beside the hotel along with PJ Clarkes (best burgers). Two subway entrances very close by, super safe neighborhood.  Close enough to do everything but far enough to be out of the craziness of Time Square.  All in all I would definitely stay there again and I can't wait to come back.;5
We checked into this hotel on Friday 5th April & spoke to Mohamed who was excellent in getting us checked in after a long day travelling we were given a room on the 34th floor which had superb views of the empire state building one of the most iconic buildings in the world the room was comfortable would have been great to have had a fridge also housekeeping services were great. So glad we stayed at the New Yorker Hotel. The hotel has a lovely feel about it and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. The room was a good size, serviced every day to an excellent standard. Great shower, free WiFi, TV, hairdryer. The alarm clock between the beds even had USB charging points. The location was perfect, so central, we could easily walk to many attractions, some of the highlights were:;5
We had a private bathroom so we cannot comment on the facility with respect to shared bathroom. The private bathroom was spotlessly clean. location is fab - walking distance to subway. The subway is on the line that takes you straight to times square and wall street and greenwich village. Not even a change of subway is required!!!  Room is small but decent size. You get to move around as the luggague can be kept in the closet space. The front staff is courteous and available at all the times.  For our needs, it was the perfect find.;5
Everyone was extremely nice, rooms were pleasant. Overall great experience. The person who checked us with a smile and was very friendly. I thought he was very like able. Asked is where we were getting getting and informed us of a few good place to go to. Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to visiting again.;5
You can't go wrong with this hotel, perfect location for Times Square,Central Park & Broadway. We had room 1110 on the 11th floor, it was comfortable & clean everything you need as a Base. WiFi in lobby was brilliant & the staff will do anything for you. Jeff helped to book a transfer back to the airport & stored our luggage. You will not have any problems finding somewhere to eat as the choice is vast. We would definitely recommend booking the hop on hop off bus around the city & the 9/11 memorial & museum is a must. We had a guide for an hour & half telling his story on the day.  Don't hesitate in staying at the hotel !!!!;5
This is my second stay in this hotel and it is even better than last time.  I love this hotel, we have a beautiful room, with a lovely view (all rooms have some sort of view as the hotel is on top of a hill). The staff are terrific (shout out to Luis on the concierge desk), we also enjoyed the Hilton Honours reception food and drinks.  I generally pick between this hotel and the Hilton Anaheim when in LA and this hotel beats Hilton Anaheim every time.  The breakfast buffet is great, one of the best Iâve seen at a Hilton in the US.  I recommend this hotel for a lovely stay.;5
We returned back from a few nights in Riad Kheirredine yesterday having had a long weekend in Marrakech without the kids to celebrate a significant anniversary. As someone who has worked in the hotel industry I have high standards of what I expect from a good hotel and Riad Kheirredine lived up to every one - in fact it exceed them.  The riad itself oozes luxury in an understated, unpretentious way that so many fail to pull off. The staff are sublime and everyone from the management to the cleaners were friendly in a manner that felt genuine rather than forced - nothing is too much trouble for them and everything is done with a smile.  There is an abundance of choice when it comes to picking a riad in Marrakech and whilst I can't testify for that qualities of any of the others,;5
This hotel is very nice and in a great and safe location.  The housekeeping was excellent and the beds were very comfortable.  We stayed for 5 days and really got to know the property.  We were in Hollywood visiting family and the only negative thing I found was that family was not able to park for a reasonable price. 3 hours cost $17.00 and anything over 3 hours cost $25.00.  I also requested extra pillows with my reservation that never showed up.  But all in all the accomidations were very nice and I would recommend this to anyone wanting to visit Hollywood and Universal Studios.;5
Riad Kheirredine is an oasis of peace, comfort and beauty in the heart of the Medina. Our most lovely days were entirely at the riad, and involved sumptuous and elaborate breakfasts, too many Moroccan mint teas (which are offered without extra charge), cosy evening readings by the fireplace and tasty Moroccan or Italian dinners at the riad's restaurant. The service was personalized and very attentive. Ibrahim and Jana made us feel very comfortable and well taken care of. The attention to detail is amazing and everything is homemade from the jams to the apple sauce, etc. They also help organise excursions out of Marrakech. The Medina tour was excellent. We also tried out the spa, and left feeling refreshed!;5
This is THE location for the Lincoln Center area which suited us superbly.  The first room we were given was quite loud (being very close to the AC units) - even though we specifically asked them to put us in a quiet one.  After I explained this to the front desk, initially they were lukewarm to this issue.  On the other hand, later on a gentleman named Ricky moved us to a quiet room for which we were grateful as it is good to be able to sleep in once in a while when you are on a vacation...  Kudos to him, this was exemplary customer service!!!  The concierges were friendly and efficient.  The bar has good cocktails and a vibrant lobby.  There are great restaurants nearby.  We highly recommend this hotel and we'll definitely return.;5
Food is amazing and delivery was fast and cute to. Joke. Anyway the portion of food is perfect, not little but just enough to satisfy your hunger also first time that I was able to eat the whole meal usually at the very end I loose my appetite or interest on my food because of the taste but your food is so tasty I don't mind seconds. Lol;5
Danny at the bell desk was amazing! He really went out of his way to help me and make me feel comfortable. He even remembered that I am from Georgia, and would always communicate when I would walk by. He is the best! - SofÃ­a;5
I greatly enjoyed my stay at the New Yorker Hotel that is centrally located near Times Square and all of the tourist locations.  There is plenty to see and do within blocks of the hotel.  The rooms were clean and relatively inexpensive for New York.  While the New Yorker is not a 5 star hotel, it provides great value for the money.;5
This hotel was good value for money and a great location, not too far from Times Square but far enough for a peaceful nights sleep. Our room and bathroom were just like the photos on the web, small but not cramped. The decor was lovely had a 1920,s feel about it and the staff were very friendly, helpful and pleasant. The only downside is you get billed for the amenities  even if you don't use them ! (This is apparently on your booking paperwork). As a good will gesture the hotel wavared the bill as we  didn't use any amenities and weren't aware that we would be charged anyway. I would definitely return to this hotel if I was to visit New York again.;5
I can't speak highly enough of Riad Kheirredine.  I stayed here for five nights at the end of February with my husband and our eight year old daughter.  We all felt so welcome and well taken care of.  The staff was amazing - so kind and generous.  The city is overwhelming and unlike anything we have seen, but the riad was the perfect place to come home to at the end of a hectic day.  Our room (Eucalyptus) was stunningly beautiful, as was the rest of the riad.  We were met at the airport, guided through the city whenever we asked and provided with tea when we needed a little refreshment.  We ate dinner at the riad twice and the food was fabulous.  This was one of the nicest places I have ever stayed and the staff was better than I could have imagined.  I wish that I could give a;5
We stayed here for 8 days and loved the hotel. All of the staff are friendly and helpful.  We immediately recognised the infamous Phil who checked us in. He is a top bloke and always said âmorningâ to us.   Hotel is clean. Pool area is lovely, secure and comfortable.  Breakfast is a lovely added touch, especially considering it is free. We ate breakfast in the hotel twice and was happy with what was on offer (Hot drinks, juices, omelette station, waffle station, sausages, mini hash browns, fruits, yogurts, cereals, variety of breads, cold meats and cheeses.   Hotel room was comfy and clean. Maid service cleaned it daily with fresh linen and towels. Very friendly. Great air con, iron and ironing board already in the room which is an added bonus! Balcony overlooking the tranquil;5
We have been searching for a full-service hotel in the Los Feliz area and after staying at the Hollywood Hotel, we think we've found it.  It's a lovely, well kept and friendly place with a very impressive breakfast included in the rate.  We will surely be back.;5
So as my title said Matt and Majid are amazing. They were both super friendly and super helpful. They got us set up in our room really quickly and answered any and all questions we had. They literally made our entire weekend! The room is very nice as well.;5
Let me start from saying that this place is well worth the value and stay. I had booked a 2 bedroom with a friend of mine and we thoroughly enjoyed our 5 nights here. The breakfast here is a must, and comes free daily. The hotel was clean and I had no issues with anything here. It was secure with parking in the back. My friend and I are from vancouver, and we have decided to stay here again upon our next trip to LA. The location is perfect and you will not be stuck in traffic, as it is very central to all the sightseeing around hollywood. Going up the street of Vermont for a 5 min drive will take you to griffith observatory(must see in LA). It was not noisy at all, and the service here was superb. I could not have asked for anything better, and am glad to have stayed here. The;5
We travelled to NYC dec 2011 from the UK. We had all been to the big apple before and wanted to sample more. I chose this hotel based on recommendation. I work in the travel industry so wanted to make sure we picked a good one. The check in process was speedy, the rooms were spotless. Our friends bedroom window would not shut properly, so they immeadiately informed the reception team and the were promptly moved. We totally loved the lobby bar. A fab location to chill out after a hard day shopping, with a good cocktail. We decided to reserve an area in the roof top club. This was not cheap, but we had the most amazing night. We were treated like VIP's and loved every minute of it.;5
I canât tell you how fabulous this Riad is.  The service from start to finish was impeccable. There was nothing to complain about at all during our stay.  We arrived late morning having used the transfer service I booked with the Riad. As our room wasnât yet ready, we were treated to a hearty breakfast of pancakes, pastries and fruit.   Then we were shown around the Riad and to our room âpoivreâ which I had requested as it had a small 2 seat balcony and was off the terrace with the pool.  We had mint tea and dates and apricots waiting for us.  We spent the rest of the day chilling out on the terrace and had a few drinks! Finally falling asleep on the comfy sofa on the terrace.  When we went out exploring, we were given a map and a mobile phone with which to call the Riad should;5
Loved staying in this hotel, everything from a to z was perfect highly recommend it to anyone. Location was great, service was very satisfying. Couldn't ask for more. Heated pool and Jacuzzi was a plus. Variety of restaurants were good but expensive.;5
We've just returned home from a 4 night stay at the Ameritania, and its been brilliant. The hotel is in a great location and then start are great, especially Jeff who works on the door and in the lobby, this man went above and beyond for us showing us all the great places in New York to visit and even booked our transport back to the airport for us. He really knows his stuff and was genuinely interested in us and where we were from ect (the 2 Scottish people). Our trip to New York was phenomenal and we got engaged at the top of the empire state building (trip made). I will 100% be returning to New York and to this hotel.;5
I recently stayed at the Americana Hotel in NYC for a girls trip.  It was a great location for the theatre.  The rooms were nicely appointed.  Everyone associated with the hotel was very pleasant.  Breakfast was good.  I needed an expedited  checkout and Majid, one of the men on duty was very accommodating.;5
Clean, great location, a very professional staff.  Would highly recommend this hotel when visiting NYC for business or pleasure. If driving park your car across the street at the Icon garage. The cab and rapid transit will handle your transport needs.;5
Great location, accommodating staff, very helpful, the room was tight but comfortable. Love the old style of the building. Very easy to public transport an d walkable to heaps of good eating. Been a couple of times and always good;5
This was my fourth time staying at the New Yorker. I just canât fault it in any way. From the moment you arrive the front desk staff greet you with warmth, professionalism and always have service with a smile. We stayed in a Queen Terraced Suite which we upgraded to on arrival. The room was spacious enough, extremely clean and the mini fridge was a bonus. The view was the most amazing part of this room. When I was awakened at 3am with jet lag to step on the terrace and see the night sky line took my breath away. Throughout our stay our room was cleaned every day to the highest of standards.  Perfectly located in midtown for all the tourist attractions.  Could not have wanted anything else out of a hotel. Will come back to this hotel time and time again! Thank you for a wonderful;5
This was honestly the best hotel we had stayed in throughout our holiday in morocco. We arrived in marrekech for a holiday in march 2012 and were welcomed at the airport by one of the hotel staff, who Provided the transfer to the hotel.   The journey was great with the driver giving us advise on the way as it was our first visit. Once arrived at the hotel we were greated with genuine, friendly staff who welcomed us into the hotel with some Moroccan tea and patisseries. We were shown around the hotel and our Room and then left to relax and absorb the fabulous modern/traditional decor and surroundings.   We stayed at the hotel for three nights and every morning were woken up to a suberb breakfast on the sunny terrace, truely a speechless service. The staff here were extremely;5
Perfect hotel for early flights out of LAX.  Long term parking next door, shuttle pick up at hotel. Have stayed here many times in the past, always up to expectations.  At checkin was given an up grade without asking.;5
Loved our stay at Riad Kheirredine, we stayed in the imperial room, it was really beautiful. The room was lovely and big, light and airy with a balcony and sitting area. The services at the Kheirredine were above and beyond, the staff are amazing people and so personable. They took care of all our needs, super polite, attentive to all our needs, they made our whole holiday experience in Morocco amazing and stress free .., I canât praise enough the support of the staff at the Riad. You honestly get gold standard if you book here and worth every penny you spend. The breakfast is very sizeable and delicious with fresh juices, they cater to your diet. The dinner was A star, throughout the day we had juices/ drinks available along with fruit. We ate out a couple of times but eating;5
Excellent  hotel right in the central of new York  Great help friendly staff uptown /downtown tours  food  available  Lots of places around close and handy  Walking distance to the empire state building  Madison square garden  Endless shopping, central heating in rooms you can also byo drinks and food in to your room ,ice available  Best time to go is summer ð but winter is ok if you want to see snow;5
The Assc Direct convention was very valuable. Plus, I had time to self reflect and get much needed rest. I was on crutches, so next time I'll be sure to swim or tan this chocolate skin. Make sure to treat yourself to a stay soon.;5
The location was perfect to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The room exceeded our expectations: Premium Queen suite actually had a King Bed, two bathrooms and a very large balcony where we spent every evening watching the city lights.  View included both the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building.;5
Very nice hotel, perfect spot in the center of Manhattan, very kind people at the desk and at the door, good beds and a lovely room! We had a great stay, the only minus point was the sound of the Airco, but we are used to hear no sound at all at home. So maybe we are a bit spoiled when it comes to hear noises during the night. We had a wonderful time in the city of New York!;5
Everyone was so nice and welcoming. Our view was absolutely beautiful, and we look forward to staying here again.;5
Absolutely terrific experience for my wife and I on a four day break to wonderful Marrakech. Fabulous Riad, and customer service that quite simply could not be improved upon. Sara, Siham, Elena, Asma, Brahim, and EVERY member of staff were outstanding in every way (sorry, I couldnât remember everyoneâs name, but it felt like there were more staff than guests, in a full hotel !). We stayed in the Eucalyptus Classic Suite - beautiful : the pictures say it all ! If you need :  a reservation, walking to anywhere, meeting when lost, laundry done, a soft drink/tea/coffee, a paid for meal (anywhere in the Riad to suit yourself), picking up from the airport, local recommendations, mobile phone with GPS to get around - all given free of charge, a smile and a âcan I help you with anything;5
"Globalist upgrade upon request; excellent staff service at breakfast, solid spread; excellent soundproofing, great view of planes taking off / on approach to LAX without any audible disturbances.  Wet bar area is nice touch. Valet parking only, but friendly and helpful staff.  Adjoining room for suite clean/well maintained but has visible evidence of previous guests.";5
We stayed here with our children last Summer (9 & 6 years at the time) and on entering the fabulous reception area, we worried it was just a bit too glamorous and grown up for families - we were wrong!  Whilst it was obviously a boutique style hotel, the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and made a real fuss of the kids with cookies and jokes! Chris the concierge was absolutely superb - so helpful and a kind, making us feel like honoured guests and arranging all sorts of special surprises during our stay. The room was fine - lovely free toiletries!!! Had a great view onto Broadway. Rooftop pool was very small but perfect for a quick dip and lounge about, whilst enjoying the views and sunshine. Thank you to all at The Empire - we hope to come back some day. Xx;5
We have stayed at this hotel many times and it never disappoints.  Perfect location, great room with unbelievable view, clean, friendly staff, in short what more can you ask?  Look forward to going back!;5
Right. The location is 5 mins walk from Times Square, Broadway and Macy's. 20 mins from Central Park. 2 train stops from JFK to Penn Street Stn. $8. Across the road. Rooms are clean and spacious.  Free WIFI. Quiet enough given its location. Security in the lobby check before you can access the lifts. Good thing. I would recommend this hotel for its location, friendly staff, cleanliness and room cleaning service.  There is a Ticket booking office in the lobby. There's a Tick Tock diner within the hotel. Open 24 hours.  Great food.;5
Hotel was very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the lobby and bar area and it's grand presentation. My sister is getting married in May and is using the hotel for all of her out of town guests. Highly recommend.;5
"We were pleasantly surprised by how terrific this Hilton property was given that it is next to a theme park.  PROS:  Clean, comfy rooms; excellent service in hotel and pool bars CONS:  Resort prices for the hotel restaurants (but not unexpected)  I would not hesitate to recommend this property to stay at for a visit to Universal Studios Hollywood, or if you just need a hotel in the area.  The rooms are spacious and clean; the beds were comfy; the air conditioning worked and was quiet; and is what you would expect for a hotel in this price point.  I think we have been disappointed many times by the price point at other theme park hotels (i.e. Disneyland) and the service/cleanliness received, but not so at this Hilton property.  This hotel was also within walking distance to";5
We had a few questions before our arrival as travelling with a toddler (and wanted to make sure all was in order before our arrival) and contacted the hotel via Facebook messaging. They were superb and nothing was too much of a bother (before and during our stay).   We were informed of the facility fee via the hotel when contacting as our provider didnât inform us! Itâs on there website and they were very apologetic about it. We got our provider to pay us and then paid the hotel when we arrived - as its clearly advertised on their website. This did first annoy us but actually having free WiFi really helped us as could plan, google and share information as well as entertain our toddler by using YouTube etc.   The hotel was originally built in 1930s so itâs got that lovely Art;5
"My husband and I recently returned from our honeymoon in Morocco. We started our adventure at Riad Kheirredine & I'm so glad we did. Marrakech is certainly a bit disorienting at first, and the staff at Riad Kheirredine are skilled at putting you at ease. From the personal escorts to several points of interest to providing a mobile phone, they gave us the skills & confidence to fully explore Marrakech, knowing they were only a phone call away if we lost our way (& we did, often!). They also went above & beyond with special ""honeymoon"" touches including flower petals strewn around our suite, a private dinner on the rooftop (best meal ever), and an endless supply of refreshments delivered to our cabana on the rooftop. We felt like royalty. The rest of our trip included other riads";5
The staff was excellent.  The room was good but is a bit over priced.  However, we would stay there again.  I booked through Wyndham but would probably shop around as it appears other websites give a better deal than Wyndham.  One would think they would reward their members but apparently not.;5
Fantastic staff and service, location is brilliant, why stay anywhere else! Mention your planned day's activities to a concierge or front desk, they can really help with local information and ideas, even if you know where you're going!;5
We stayed here for three nights. The bellman and housekeepers made you feel at home. The accommodations were great. The room was small but was equivalent to New York standards. The room was clean and centrally located to the sites of the city. Would stay here on my next visit to the big apple.;5
I have stayed all almost every hotel in the LAX area. This hotel is in the perfect spot. Itâs the closest hotel to the airport. You could walk to your departing gate if you wanted some extra exercise before a long flight. If not the Hyatt airport shuttle come ever 5-10 mins. Great staff, amazing room service rooms are great.;5
Very pleased with my two day stay and the price.  Metro nearby.  Staff went above and beyond in helpfulness from front desk person to housecleaning to the bartender.  The lobby bar was a comfortable place to return to out of the bustle of the city to relax in a comfortable and pleasing environment. Will definitely return.;5
We love this place.  The staff are friendly and courteous and we feel the hotel is centrally located.  It's always sad to check out.  The rooms are great and we have not stayed anywhere else since discovering this hotel.;5
I was initially concerned because of the proximity to the airport but the hotel was actually very quiet.  You could here the big jets taking off but it was not an issue.  The hotel was very clean with excellent rooms.  The only issue was that they did not have a concierge to help with things to do.;5
The Wyndham New Yorker is in the center of New York city, it is a clean Hotel with spacious rooms, 24 hour Key check security, Elegant Lobby and friendly staff.  We stayed for 4 nights got a great deal on a high floor room.  Our future stay will always be at the New Yorker  In New York city.;5
Nice and clean rooms in a very central location.  Great staff, Jeff helped me in organising my transfer to the airport and was really kind and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back here when in NYC;5
A very nice hotel. Our rooms were clean, with plenty of space. The staff were helpful and attentive, and the hotel was in a terrific location. A very nice place for a very good price. We would definitely stay here again.;5
Nicole was so amazing through-out our stay at the Hollywood Hotel. Always had a smile when we came to the front desk to ask questions and inquire about Los Angeles. Thank you for making our stay great Nicole! We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the Christmas decorations at the Hotel!;5
The Universal Hilton is so close to Universal Studios it's nearly in the park. Staff are knowledgable of the park & the concierge is amazing. This is the place to stay to ensure you maximise your park visiting hours;5
"Reviews of Riad Kheirredine list wonderful ambience,  brilliant staff and all that goes towards the very best hotel experience.  They are all true. During our stay, a special touch was five staff members coming to our room singing ""Happy Birthday"" while presenting a delicious birthday cake.  Just the perfect place to stay.";5
It is a very nice hotel! Not far from Hollywood blv. The workers are really nice and helpful! They have everything you need while you're away. I would recommend this place to anyone. Plus they have a buffet breakfast which is really good!;5
Walking distance to Universal studios. Great stay!! beautiful view, great hot breakfast, check in staff was very friendly. Also staff at the Cafe Sierra.. I would definitely return to this hotel but not in the month of December or holiday season. Parking was horrible due to company holiday parties.;5
What a beautiful property! This hotel was practically perfect. Walking distance to universal and city walk (BUT had FREE shuttle if you wanted a quick drive). Breakfast Buffet for gold members was a delicious spread and on Sundays they have buffet style as well which was delicious seafood. Samantha at the concierge was A+!! Friendly, efficient, and extremely helpful. Room was spacious and very clean. The pillows and bed in general were extremely comfy. If I'm ever in the area again I would HIGHLY recommend this property.;5
We had an amazing stay at the Hollywood Hotel - we had two bookings one at the start and one at the end of our trip and both times we were very fortunate to get early check-ins! The staff were all super helpful, especially Pil who went above and beyond to get us settled. The location was great for what we needed, and the rooms were very clean and spacious! Will definitely be back.;5
I loved the property and love the way I was treated. In my opinion the restaurant was overpriced for the quality of food, but the bar, store and all of the staff were absolutely amazing . Shout out to Pedro and Dewayne! They made my stay amazing!;5
For at least ten years, our family has stayed at the New Yorker hotel when we visit from the Boston area. It is clean, comfortable, and full of fun Art Deco touches. The Tick Tock Diner next door is also excellent. We have recommended it to many many people.;5
This hotel is clean, modern and the staff are friendly and helpful.It's about a 15 minute walk to Times Square. Or you can take the subway. The red line number 1 was the best option for us.The only fault I could find is that it was too warm.;5
Rooms are Clean and state of the Art bathroom.Food is good.Staff is friendly and courteous.Will definitely recommend to my friends and clients.concierge Service is awesome.Hotel is close to the airport and they offer free shuttle to and from airport.;5
My girlfriend and I recently stayed at Riad Kheirredine in Marrakech for 4 nights and we both had a fantastic time.  We would have absolutely no problem recommending this place to anyone.  It's a proper little oasis in the middle of all the madness...  Forget the new town, forget normal hotels, if you want a real treat and an authentic Moroccan experience, a Riad in the centre is the only way to go and Riad Kheirredine from our experience was wonderful.  One of the main joys of Marrakech is to wander through the souks and enjoy the hectic buzz of all the street sellers, the people, the haggling... and if the mood takes you, buying spices and anything else that tickles your fancy!    Kheirredine is a sanctuary in the middle of all this.  The staff were very friendly and;5
Mercy at the front desk had such amazing service! She was so kind, helpful and efficient! I would come back here again  just bc of the experience she created for me -  They need to hire more people like her :);5
The hotel was very clean and organized. The staff was very helpful and nice to work with.  The hotel was in a perfect location to all the attractions that I visited.;5
I had a great stay at this hotel. Friendly people and great customer service. Nancy accommodated me with everything me and my family needed. Very nice clean rooms, and great housekeeping. I would definitely go back there in my near vacations future. Had so much fun;5
My girlfriends and I went for a 5 day NYC trip as a pre-celebration for my summer wedding. Being a huge Gossip Girl (Blaire and Chuck Bass for the win) fan, The Empire was my go to destination with a heartbeat! Knowing the purpose of our stay, the hotel sent us a bottle of wine and chocolates to celebrate and the room was splendid. Lincoln center was directly beside the hotel and Columbus Circle as well. The hotel is in a location where almost everything is within walking distance. The ladies and I were able to watch the NYC ballet preform Here/Now which was spectacular. A special thanks to Maria, the concierge Yuri, and Empire Hotel for making me feel like I was Blaire Waldorf.;5
I had a corner suite, it was a spectacular view of the city and I had two rooms, one sofa bed and one queen bed and or three people t was a great price. Bedding and rooms were very clean, there is very good breakfast in the the restaurent and best bagels in five minutes walk on 35th street.;5
I live in The Jane's neighborhood and booked a last-minute room for New Year's Day, due to an issue with my apartment.  The front desk staff was beyond gracious, especially for late in the evening of a holiday.  The Captain's Cabin was 19th-century-hotel-charming and very clean.  The terrace wasn't usable due to the snow, but what a sweet feature.  The radiator heat wasn't controllable, and the water wasn't very hot during my morning shower, but I chalk those up to an old building.  Overall, the staff more than compensated for those features.  Will return!;5
Had surgery scheduled at Mount Sinai West and needed a place to stay that was close the night before! Everyone was helpful, room was comfortable, location was great! Couldnât have asked for a better stay!;5
We spent four nights here while visiting Universal City and couldn't have been closer with less than 10 minutes to the park gates. Our room was on the 21st floor with lovely views particularly of the sunset. Staff were friendly and helpful and it was probably the quietest room I have ever stayed in. Also convenient for Hollywood as only a short walk to the metro.;5
We spent one night here before our flight home the next morning. The staff were great, room service was delicious and the shuttle to the airport was convenient. The decor was modern and very nice. There is a restaurant as well as an area that has snacks and desserts near check in.;5
Excellent stay - This hotel is in a perfect location.  Each staff member set the tone for an enjoyable trip.  Daniel, Jose, and Mike greeted us with âWelcome to the Empire Hotelâ, âGood Morningâ, âIs there any thing I can do for youâ as we left each day and as we returned, âWelcome back - Did you have a good day?â  Arrived early and room was not ready got upgraded to the Broadway side and the view was great. Room was comfortable for NYC.  The room was a little stuffy at first, but maintenance quickly resolved the problem.  The front desk staff Mariana, Gabriel and Sean (Manager) offered excellent services with directions and all our needs during the stay.  Indeed it was a great NYC get-away - would stay there again!  Of course, a little partial I love CHOCOLATE!;5
Happy can do staff without the attitude you sometimes find in more luxurious hotels It does what it says on the tin and then outperforms your expectations Spacious room with good lighting very efficient air con, very comfortable bed choice of pillows and tea and coffee. We wanted herbal tea bags and they cam almost immediately!;5
Reliable and comfortable with a top location. Very comfortable well equipped room and great staff. Why pay silly prices elsewhere ? Beds are superb and everything is up to date. Only issue was the wi fi which was rubbish in our room (617);5
Very nice hotel, beautifully done renovation. Staff was very helpful and the rooms were very clean.  The bathroom was gorgeous!   I had a view of the airport, which I loved.  Everything was within driving distance, UBER!;5
We will definitely stay here again! This hotel has so much history and the fact that was the hotel were the great Nikola Tesla stayed. Our room was in the same floor that he stayed  we loved the experience.;5
I cannot say enough wonderful things about this beautiful Riad. The people were lovely, the room was spacious and comfortable and the food was to die for. No ask was too big or too small for the staff. Sara and Elanor (I'm probably spelling that all wrong) were especially warm and inviting. They were always checking in to make sure we had everything we needed and were happy and well taken care of.  Before even arriving at the Riad, Sara assisted in booking all of the activities and reservations we needed during our stay. She was wonderful. The place was immaculate as well - super important to me while traveling to feel clean and safe! They did all our laundry and everything was clean, fresh and pressed when we returned to the room at the end of the day. Anytime we were lounging;5
We loved the location of this Hilton...directly across the road from Universal Studios California.  A 5 min walk to the entrance of Universal and a view of the park too...FABULOUS!  Watched the fireworks on New Years Eve.;5
The hotel is located in a great location in Manhattan. Subways are on the block. Easy access to just about any attraction that NYC has to offer. Spacious lobby. Restaurant has the old-time diner's charm, very family friendly. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Room rates are decent for such a great location. Make sure you book it on the hotels' webiste or with it's staff to get better rates. Third-party platforms can be a rip-off. I booked from reservations.com first. It hid the hurrendous surcharges. I cancelled it at a cost, but booked again directly from the hotel's website, got assistance from the hotel staff who were super helpful and friendly. In the end, I save money as compared with the louse reservations.com.;5
Itâs a nice hotel within walking distance to restaurants and central park. The stuff was super friendly specially Thileli. the room was small but super clean. There is a complimentary  coffee in the lobby for early morning risers like me!  Worth to come back again!!;5
I like a comfortable bed and a clean, quiet room.  My room was comfortable, clean and quiet.  I liked the around-the-corner separation of the bathroom and bedroom areas.  Check-in was very fast.  The staff pulled up my name in seconds.  I  had an excellent experience.;5
"Very clean room and perfect location; close to most amenities.  Was lovely to experience staying in the old Marrakesh City.  The staff was very helpful, always cheerful and nice to talk to, especially Iman, Elena and Sara! As for the dining staff, they were also great and the food was delicious!  We enjoyed taking strolls in the streets of old Marrakesh, exploring the beautiful culture of Morocco.  We were introduced to a driver called Mohamed Bachki from ""4x4 Morocco"" minicab office, he took us everywhere and made our trips fun and enjoyable.  He taught us a lot about the history of Morocco wherever we went.  His driving was smooth and he made our stay extra special.  Kind regards, Salim and Zeina Hamandi";5
Hotel is nice.. location is good.room is nice.I like all  people They service very nice.room is clean. and front disk  people service nice. offer girl the name is Heidi wong, she very nice help me everything. even time.I thanks so mach.;5
We loved our stay! Very clean & beautiful hotel. The security was great & the help from the staff was amazing! We would definitely stay again if we come back to the city. The location is perfect for walking to all the sites & shopping. Just a stones throw to Maddison square garden! Great place for sure.;5
the hollywood hotel treats guest right. booking. com did us wrong and cancel our reservation at our hotel. came in and talked to pil and he took care of us right. gave us a great room and took care of us right;5
Really nice hotel. Room was immaculate upon arrival and the saily cleaning was top notch. Breakfast was delicious, although a little pricey. A free shuttle bus every 15 mins from hotel to City Walk Universal Studios where there are lots if restaurants and stores so you dont have to eat in the hotel every night. Not much to entertain you in the hotel though so you will find you go iut most of the time. Nice pool area with comfortable beds and private areas.;5
We stayed here as a couple for 3 days. Overall the hotel is very well maintained, the staff is very friendly and willing to help the customers. Our room was clean, the restroom was ok, the sink and the curtains were clean. We would stay here definitely again.;5
"It was exactly as promised.    My room was clean, sheets were crisp, pillows were fluffy!  It was small, but I knew it would be.    I would suggest viewing the photos that have been posted by other travelers so that you know what the rooms are like before booking.    While I was checking in a woman came down after seeing her room and she was all upset saying the room was like a ""prison cell"" and how she was a ""big girl"" and would not be able to fit on the twin bed.  And that there was no space for her boyfriend.    She clearly booked the room without doing her research.  The manager handeled the situation perfectly by telling her that she knowingly booked a single room and that she could cancel the booking.    The shared restrooms were the only thing I was a bit worried about";5
I stayed at the hotel for five days end of October and must say I don't understand all of the negative reviews. I am very fussy and I honestly could not find a single thing that I would have changed. 3 of us stayed in a suit because a lot of the reviews say that the rooms are small. This room was perfect, really big especially for New York standards. We didn't here any noise from next door rooms or outside.  I was usually awake about 5.30 (jet lag) but felt really safe going done to the lobby at this time and catching up on emails etc. there is also a Starbucks a few doors down that open at 6am. Perfect. Location is superb for everything. The staff are really friendly, especially the concierge.  Nice bar area with a good vibe at anytime of day. I went up to the pool deck few;5
Our room wasn't ready when we asked for an early check in at 1:00. Mohammed assured us he would do his best to get us into a room quickly and he would give us a great room. He did both! About 15 minutes later we had just ordered our meal at the Tick Tock Diner when Mohammed called to tell us our room was ready. We were pleasantly surprised to find a room with two closets and two bathrooms!  Every employee we have seen here so far has been very friendly and helpful. Lots of smiling people! Would definitely stay here again.;5
When looking for a hotel near Central Park we stumbled upon The Empire. I couldn't believe that such a design orientated boutique hotel could be a similar price to bland huge corporate hotel like The New Yorker. The decor was fabulous, the food great and unlike many other trendy hotels in the city ( like The Hudson), it had doormen outside so that it felt safe and unthreatening and there were no beggars on the doorstep. The price reflects some problems the hotel experiences like slow lifts and when we were there the hot water was off for a while....but they compensated with things like free wifi in the rooms. I think many of the more negative reviews of the hotel are not actually 'seeing the wood for the trees'. If you want an ordinary experience, go to an ordinary hotel. The;5
"To put it simply the best hotel stay weâve ever had (and weâve had some incredible ones).  They have all the bases covered; lovely dÃ©cor, comfortable spacious rooms (highly recommend the Imperial Suites), great good (do book a meal for your arrival nightâ¦and take it on the roof terrace), and a superb attentive staff (more on that in a moment).  The Riad is in a quiet area of the medina (old city) so you have fairly easy access to the souks and sites without the noise.  It has a posh yet comfortable atmosphere and is beautifully decorated throughout (rooms, lobby, public areas and terraces).  The breakfast was lovely and filling, you can take in in your room, on the terrace or the restaurant.  The food served at dinner was wonderful (suggest the traditional Moroccan Meal for your";5
Great hotel!!  Clean rooms, amazing service (including room service) and the location is perfect if doing a short stop over between flights. Stayed by myself with my baby and felt safe. Will stay again next time I need a LAX hotel!;5
Stayed at this lovely hotel for 5 nights. The location is excellent . Madison Square Gardens,Penn Station and the Subways. You are approx 20 mins walk from Times Square and also the Empire State Building and Macyâs is 10 mins Walk.The staff were excellent and nothing was to much trouble. The room was very pleasant and in Art Deco style and had a bath and shower.Our room was cleaned daily to. There is always a security person checking to make sure you are a resident at the hotel before you get into the lift . There is a fitness suite which guests can access. Do not forget the taxes charge for your stay. The staff will explain this more to you.There is a dinner and another bar attached to the hotel. Down stairs there is the hotels vault bar and dining area which is set in a piece;5
"In order to catch a very early morning flight from LAX, we spent the night before at the Hyatt Regency.  The system allowed us to check in on line so that everything was ready upon arrival.  Excellent front desk and concierge service; food in the restaurant was quite good.";5

For the 2nd year in a row, my client has booked us into this spectacular vintage property! Completed in 1929, the Art Deco feel is there throughout the hotel. Comfortable cozy rooms with super-strong hot water pressure and easy to use heating/AC.      I wanted to extend my stay on my own after the conference I was attending, and Alexis helped me out first on the phone before I arrived, and then turned me over to the lady in charge: Kader, who arranged the switch-over at a far better rate than the client had paid for the group! Thank you, Kader! AND when I arrived onsite I was greeted and assisted by not only Kader herself, but the outstanding Lynn as well, who even did me one better by conferring with Kader and arranging an upgrade for me.       This hotel has a million guests;5
On 8th Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets, this is a location hard to beat.  The front desk staff were all helpful and friendly, the room was very clean, well decorated, comfortable and quiet, the Tick Tock Diner in the lobby is open 24/7, and the business center lets you print out boarding passes.  An unusual plus is the lower lobby with a fascinating exhibit of the early days of the hotel in the late 1920s and early 1930s with its enormous barbershop, 90 switchboard operators, and many celebrities!  Worth taking the escalator down to visit this exhibit.  We will be back in New York City in a few months and have already booked our next stay here.;5
The staff is great starting at the top Garret was very professional and Janet is very helpful experienced and welcoming she just great ...The housingkeeping staff is excellent The bellman and door staff are great and professional  ....;5
We stayed here for our last night in NYC for our Anniversary (09/02/2018).  It was a corner room with a view of W 54th and Broadway.  The space is great and very clean, decors are very nice and the room layout is very smart and cute.  Upon our arrival, the hotel welcome us with a Champagne for our Anniversary.  Staffs are very nice and welcoming.  We love our 1105 room.  It is only 12 short blocks walking distance to Time Square.;5
My boyfriend and I booked a room over the weekend for a romantic getaway. We wanted it to be special and it certainly was. Nicole Agnello was very accommodating and ensured that she provided us with the best experience possible. Any time we needed assistance, we requested her by name because it became obvious to us from the start that she was definitely the right person to go to get things done. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean and spacious. I would certainly recommend this hotel to my friends.;5
After reading reviews about the size of the rooms, at check in we enquired into a larger room. We were offered a suite with a balcony at a very reasonable cost. The room was a little dated but the size and the view from the balcony more than made up for that. To the left was a view of the Empire State building to the right buildings and a glimpse of the Hudson River. We often look McDonald's iced drinks onto the balcony after a long day!!  You need to show a key card to a staff member to gain access to the lifts one side  to floor 20 the other side 21-40!!!  The hotel is in a great location for Times Square, Broadway and the subway. Would definitely take a walk along the highline. Lots of places nearby to buy souvenirs and snacks. New York in general felt a little unpredictable,;5
Staff are so attentive at this hotel. It was my daughterâs first time in London and I was a little worried as she is autistic and hates crowds. On Sunday morning breakfast was really busy but Dana made sure she offered a table away from everyone so we could enjoy our breakfast. We will definitely be back.;5
Stayed in The Jane with my husband to celebrate my 40th birthday and it was perfect. It has a vintage feel to it and we stayed in the captains cabin , which had its own bathroom with a deep tub in it.there was also a balcony area . The hotel is in a fabulous location as it is near a high fashion meat packing district , it is surrounded by tons of restaurants. there are complimentary bikes with the hotel, and you have access to a cycle lane which is just across the road. also the high line ends near the hotel. We had a  fab time in this beautiful city and recommend this hotel and the lovely friendly staff that are ultra helpful.;5
Nice room. Good facility. Beautiful entrance. Self parking available. Lots of restaurants. Many floors. We had gone for a wedding in the same hotel. They took good care of us. Very close to universal studios.;5
So close to universal and city walk. Hotel staff were great, had zero issues with lifts. Staff seemed to be around the lift locations keeping them moving. Late check in was smooth and room clean and quiet;5
My husband and I have stayed in hotels all around the world and know weâll never have a stay as remarkable as Riad Kheirredine!  The property is truly stunning. Someday I hope to design parts of my house like the rooftop terrace. I could have lounged there all day every day. And I am that person who always finds strangerâs hairs in even the nicest hotel rooms. This Riad was the cleanest establishment Iâve ever stayed at. The cleaning crew is incredible. And the best meals we had in Morocco were at the Riad. Definitely eat at least one dinner there.  While the property itself is luxurious and inspired, the team at Riad Kheirredine truly made our time in Marrakech a wonderful experience! This was my husband and my first time in Africa and we were admittedly a bit nervous. We;5
This is without a doubt one of the best hotels Iâve ever stayed at. Keeping in mind that Iâve been to numerous Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons, this one is definitely in my top three!  Rooms are made twice a day and laundry service was impeccable, it usually took no longer than a few hours. Temperature and detergent were also noted down which is something Iâve never seen before.  I really loved the attention to detail as well, no room was like the other and staff were the friendliest people in the world.  Not to mention the amazingly delightful breakfast that we got to enjoy every morning - everything was perfect to a T.  There is not a single thing that I could criticise about this gorgeous, lovely Riad.  If you decide not to stay here you will deprive yourself of a unique,;5
Excellent hotel to stay while visiting Universal Studios. Courtesy shuttle takes you to the park. Everything is great here . Staff well trained, courteous and friendly and helpful. Thereâs a Peetâs coffee in the lobby too  thank goodness!;5
We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the New Yorker. We had booked the trip for a concert at Madison Square Gard and have to say this was perfect as it was just a few steps away. Had a great corner room and loved the  beautiful view of the city.  The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Room was a nice size by New York City standards. Would have liked a little more room in the bathroom but I guess you canât have it all. All in all it was a great trip and we would definitely stay here again. Thank you.;5
I can't say enough about the friendliness of the staff here.  Everyone from the doorman to the front desk personnel were welcoming and helpful.  The hotel was clean and our room was surprisingly large.  We did not eat in the restaurant so I cannot comment on that.  I was very worried about finding the parking garage that offered the hotel discount (Icon) but it is on the same street and just a short walk from the hotel.  The hotel stored our bags for us before check in and after check out which was helpful.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
Another of my reviews that has been deleted, so trying again...  This is a lovely place to stay. It has a great location in the Medina. When you arrive its a bit unnerving as a guide meets you at a road junction and walks you through a maze of alleys. But stick with it - the destination is worth it and its surprisingly how quickly to get to know the routes and we never got lost.  We stayed in the Rose room, nicely decorated and appointed with an endless supply of water and fresh fruit - a hotel chain this isn't..  Breakfast was taken every morning on the roof terrace - and was sufficient to last us the whole day and sorted us for our daily attack on sights of Marrakesh. then it was back to the sanctuary of the Kheirredine for a a dip in the plunge pool, a rest and to catch some;5
This large hotel sits upon a hill overlooking Ventura Blvd. in Universal City.  An easy walk, for those who enjoy walking, to City Walk, or shopping in Studio City. (About 2-3 miles)  The rooms are large and there are nice hotel amenities.  One morning we awoke in a cloud only to see the blue sky in a few minutes.;5
This is my go to hotel when I have to overnight or have an early morning departure out of LAX. Great location, good amenities and excellent staff. Price has gone up considerably due to the increase in travel.;5
This hotel is right across the street from Universal Studios Hollywood.  They offer $10 off tickets and purchased from the concierge you get early access to the park before they open to the public. We rode all the best rides and attractions before noon.  Came back to the hotel for a lunch and a swim break before finishing the day at the park.  Breakfast buffet is amazing.  Parking again is a little pricy.  But I loved this hotel.  Had a great view of the hills and the park.;5
Awesome stay amazing hotel & customer service, excellent location. Room with a view of empire state building & madison sq garden WOW!!!! stayed here for my husbands 50th a big shout out to Rachael at check in who organised a bottle of bubbly to our room on the day of hubbys birthday much appreciated. Tick tock diner was suberb, food was excellent have to mention sam the bartender he was a true gent & so welcoming.Thank you wyndham new yorker forr making our first time in new york truly special.;5
I have stayed here several times and never hesitate to book a room when I need it.  In five or ten minutes, you can walk to any terminal and the staff is amazing.  Also, the fitness room is really high quality and it's on the top floor so the views are incredible.  You can watch planes taking off and landing and see the ocean, all while on one of the fitness machines.;5
We stayed at the Riad for 3 nights at the Yasmine suite.  The staff was wonderful and made sure our stay was 100%. The rooftop view is a amazing. The Riad provides you with a local phone so you can reached them at any time if something comes up.  The location is brilliand and surpriceny quiet, we slept like babies.;5
great location and staff all very friendly and willing to help. The evening porter went above and beyond - even ordered a taxi and a limo turned up! The rooms were clean and had everything you would expect. A little noisy on a night but you can't really complain when staying in the centre of NYC! Would have preferred tea and coffee making facilities in the room itself as opposed to the main reception but maybe this is the American way?!;5
We were only here for one night at the hotel next door to the Hyatt. That hotel had just remodeled and did not have a full service restaurant - yet. we searched Yelp and found this property had a renown restaurant. Very happy with the service from Juan our waiter and the food. Although the menu was small - all on one page the portions were huge! Must be from their Chicago roots.  I had the Caesar salad that could have fed two, and under the recommendation of Juan I had the Drunken noodle bowl with chicken. Very Good and huge. Good choice of wines and craft beers. We all left very satisfied.;5
We visited RK for 4 nights and we couldnât have had a better stay. The room (musk suite) was amazing, loads of space to relax and take in the piece and tranquility of the riad and the contrast of the medina. The sun terrace was beautiful and comfortable for sunbathing in the sun and we had a wonderful wash and massage in the spa. Service was impeccable, from the staff who would help us find restaurants amongst the maze of the local area, to the amazing breakfast, drinks and snacks provided as part of our stay. Marrakech was a joy to visit and RK made it perfect. We will return next year - guaranteed.;5
Wonderful hotel in nice quiet location near Central Park. Hotel staff very nice and helpful.  Excellent service with near by bus and subway and taxis available at all times.  Hotel has great character and style;5
This place felt like magic! There were so many places to eat and things to do along the Universal walkway. After spending most of the day at the park, we had a late lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe and dinner at Bubba Gump Shrimp. Our mini vacation was action packed. The park and scenery was absolutely beautiful!!!;5
Excellent locations and all essentials done well.  Not a luxury property, but location, staff, good bed, good shower help it punch above weight.  Will certainly continue to use as provides all the necessities for a city stay.;5
Lovely hotel with very accomodating front desk staff, Catie and Elias were great in allowing us an early check in after a long flight! Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a good place to stop after a long flight.;5
This was a truly executive experience. The Empire Hotel has superb facilities, attentive staff, and five-star ambience. I would recommend this hotel to business travelers or tourists alike. You couldn't find a better hotel in Manhattan.;5
My husband and I spent a lovely night at the Empire Hotel after attending the opera at the Met. The staff including the front desk-Sofhy, the bellmen and waitress at the lounge were all professional and efficient making our stay very nice. Our room was clean and well appointed. We were given an upgraded room and were able to check in early which was helpful to our day's agenda. This is our 2nd stay at the Empire and hope to stay here again in the future.;5
This is the closest airport hotel to LAX.  The rooms were nicely remodeled.  The shuttle was efficient and on time.  The restaurant was good and lively.    There isn't much more to expect from an airport hotel.;5
Great hotel.  Clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful.  Great location for someone coming into the city to be near Penn Station to get into and around on the subway system. Definitely will stay there again.;5
(review of Captains Cabin) Amazig location, such a fun, stylish hotel. Cafe Gitane room service, awesome bar, great look and rooms (while small) are well kitted out with nice bathrooms. Wouldn't hesitate to return;5
The New Yorker is the first hotel we have used in NYC. It was recommended to us by a friend due to its location. It is really close to Penn station meaning train travel from the airport (JFK in our case) was really simple plus there was no lugging cases round the city as we were in the hotel in a matter of 2 minutes. The subway is served by Penn station too so really easy to navigate the city. The hotel is one of the oldest in NYC but is well maintained and our room (3132) was clean and tidy as were the public areas. Check in was simple and quick and we were made to feel welcomed. There are plenty of lifts and they are split equally to serve the bottom half of the hotel (lobby to floor 20) and the top half (floor 21 to floor 40).  Our upgraded room was cleaned on a daily basis;5
A very pleasant hotel, superb location. Penn Station is right around the corner. Book room 3714 on the 37th floor. Stunning view! No breakfast included but there is everything you need around - pharmacy, supermarkets, good take away food corners.  Will choose The New Yorker hotel again if I come to NYC.;5
On the upper west side overlooking Lincoln Center.  One block from Central Park.  Near lots of restaurants and subways.  Very clean and efficient.  More like a European hotel.  Small bathroom.  We got a great deal.  Nice rooftop lounge and nice lobby bar.  Starbucks on the corner.  Great place for visiting NYC.;5
The location is really close to universal studios, they have a shuttle that goes there. Wish the shuttle had approximate arrival departure times but easy to find. Room was clean. Kind of weird there was a door in the room for another room but no issues. Staff was nice. Breakfast was ok unless you upgraded;5
Was good. The breakfast was the best. Hugo made the best omelets. The room was spacious  and very clean. The area was not the best but was close to everything .parking was safe and cost $ 20 dollars. I will stay in this hotel again;5
I attended a conference with EF Travel with a large group. This hotel was hosting Many large groups  and handled it with ease.  During our stay we had a few issues with the room that we reported at checkout as we did not want to move we were in room 701 however Iâm very confident that this room received the TLC it needed when we departed.  I was in the hotel industry for over 13 years and things happen in rooms ware and tear and general issues just like in any home what makes a hotel unique and special is their  service.  Every time I turned around someone was going above and beyond and had a smile and friendly greeting.  The breakfast crew and the Bellman weâre all extraordinary but one stood out from all the others .  This is hard to do when everyone is already doing their;5
Wonderful experience - I highly recommend this hotel!  The Bell and Concierge staff were exceptional, very friendly and helpful, and the food and beverage (both restaurant and room service) were excellent.   The rooms were very clean and the overall ambiance was lovely.  I will definitely stay at the Hilton Universal City again.;5
My partner and I came to NYC for our 5th Anniversary.  Everyone at the Ameritania went above and beyond our expectations.  It was always refreshing to have Jeff greet us in the morning as we were leaving to explore the city.    Will definitely return to this hotel, if I am able to book a room.;5
"this was the best hotel we have ever stayed at in NYC! First of all it was right in the center of everything. Beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable room, and quite large for downtown NYC!! It was super quiet in the room, even though we were right in the heart of the city on a weekend. I would like to give a shout out to the amazing front desk staff; Sarah, Nay, Robb Serg and Jana who were so friendly and helpful the whole stay! I have never felt so welcomed or comfortable in the city before.";5
Quiet, clean, great staff and good internet. Food was fabulous. Room service was quick and convenient. Shuttle service to nearby sites was a bonus. We would stay at this hotel again. It was quiet and the beds were perfect for a great nights sleep. Bellhops were great and the price was great.;5
Went to NYC for a 50th Birthday pressie and I booked this hotel as part of a package of which I was not disappointed by  this location of the Hotel or it's staff. Located right in the heart  of the city - Maddison Square Gardens opposite, 5 mins walk to Macy's and 10 mins if that to the Empire State Building. Upon checking in - I had no issue at all - the reception staff whilst busy were very polite and friendly and allowed us to check in early as a waiver which was a very nice service indeed. The queen metro room ( paid extra for a view) whilst small was very clean and tidy and actually very comfortable - no issue with house keeping or the condition/apperance ( Room 3303).Yes some of the corridors are a little outdated but it has  an art deco feel that cannot be replicated with;5
I stayed in the hotel during my holidays, with my wife and other relatives, and the experience was excellent. The location is great, the hotel is in excellent condition, and the staff was very helpful at all moment.;5
I have been burned by several hotels near LAX over the years so I was thrilled to have a good experience at this Hyatt. Check in was smooth, my room was spotless and comfortable, the food in the in-house restaurant was good with friendly and efficient service, and the shuttle was timely upon my departure. Very satisfied and will definitely stay here again.;5
Fabulous Trip to stay at the Hilton to visit Universal Studios, tour and be with family to watch nieces at the International Ballroom Dancing competition. The facility was beautiful and the beds so comfortable to sleep very well. The concierge was so helpful to get tickets to Universal Studios.;5
Thank you Teresa and Jessica from the Front Desk at the Hilton Universal Studios for once again going over and above to ensure my stay was excellent. This is an amazing property and I am always upgraded to the Best rooms they have available.  The resturant and rooms are just awesome.  Canât find the time to write enough great things about this hotel as It would take all day. An absolute MUST stay when you are in the LA area.;5
Hotel in style of art deco is very clean, well located and security is excellent.  Tick Tock Restaurant on site is great for food at all hours. able to bring our therapy dog with us as the hotel is pet friendly. I am a Wyndham time share owner so was able to use my points for this stay;5
Clean, spacious rooms, very friendly staff and great location in the city.  From the valet, to guest check in, to the housekeeping staff, all extremely very polite, helpful and beyond friendly. I highly recommend this property!;5
I have stayed at this hotel now for three different stays and it is perfect each time. They have three very different on site restaurants, have a person to check that you are really a guest before you get to use the elevators (very reassuring for solo travelers), extremely helpful and pleasant staff, and some wonderful views of the city. Although it can be a bit noisy considering the neighborhood, just request an upper floor and youâll be fine-remember, Iâm from rural Vermont so my definition of noisy/quiet may be a lot diferent than yours. This hotel is within one block of Madison Square Garden so after your event getting back to your hotel is hassle free! Definitely a perk! It also has a fascinating history which is curated in a small museum in the lower lobby.;5
Pil at the front desk is always helping me everytime i need somthing, service is good, and the rooms are big, very clean. very relaxing and theres a pool area.. everything is good here at the hotel...;5
We had a perfect stay in Riad Kheirredine--a magical place with an unbeatable rooftop terrace.  Every member of the staff did everything possible to make us feel welcome and accomodate every request.  Can't wait to return again!;5
Check in and check out were easy and quick. The hotel had a DJ one night with some good music. The lobby does have free wifi. They were able to hold our luggage until our flight since we had a late flight. The hotel is at a great location if you want to walk to central park or times square. We barely took the subway or cabs, just bring your walking shoes! The rooftop bar was really cute, drinks were a little pricey but great view. I would stay there again.;5
The room was an excellent size, quiet and dark which is ideal for an airport location. The location is great for exploring anywhere in Los Angeles. All the staff we encountered were extremely professional, helpful and friendly!;5
This hotel is in a prime location when visiting New York. Just a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building, Macy's and Times Square. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate and suited our needs as we were rarely in it. The hotel staff were friendly and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel when checking out to make the most of our last day in the city. Would definitely stay here again.;5
This was our second stay at The New Yorker and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is in a perfect central location to see downtown and uptown manhattan. Close to Penn station you can access most subway links. Clear view of The Empire State Building from many rooms. The diner serves a great breakfast and for a more upmarket evening meal the Trattoria is lovely. Staff are always friendly and extremely helpful. Thanks to Mohammed on reception who made the check in process smooth and quick. Will definitely return here again;5
always a pleasure to return to Empire hotel in NYC. Great facilities, with great staff, always willing to help.. also the rooftop bar is not to shabby. AMazing location, just a stroll away from central park, Columbus circle and Midtown;5
The Ameritania is situated in an excellent location,  equidistant to Times Square and Central Park.  The rooms are a little on the small size, but as you spend most of the time visiting the the numerous sites around the city, perfectly adequate.  On booking in, the receptionist did say, if we were not happpy with our room, as it was on a lower floor and may be disturbed by traffic noise, they would find us a room on a higher floor, the following morning. We had no problem at all, although a couple of people in our party did request a move, which was acted upon. We will definitely return to New York and the Ameritania.;5
This hotel was in the perfect location to get around NYC. Subway just down the street, a stones throw from Times Square & Central Park. The staff were always polite and willing to assist. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We would definately stay here again. We love NYC.;5
The only negative I have is I feel it's overpriced-though not outside of the norm for the area.  It was very convenient access to Universal Studios and the City Walk and the free shuttle was an added bonus.;5
Best location for hotel when traveling via LAX. Long term parking adjacent to hotel. Clean, spacious and modern rooms with very comfortable beds. Good restaurant for breakfast and 24 hour snack stand in lobby! Complementary water in rooms.;5
My wife and I spent three nights in Riad Kheirredine for our Christmas holiday and still can't believe how great our stay was. We've been fortunate enough to do a lot of travelling and the level of service at Riad Kheirredine was on a completely different level than anywhere we have stayed before. Yajaira and Valentina felt like long-lost friends and went well out of their way to make our stay perfect. Youssef was very friendly and did a great job teaching us the route from the Riad to the square. We never had any trouble finding our way around after his lesson. Thank you so much for making our trip so special! Matt and Karina;5
Excellent hotel. Friendly professional staff. Great amenities. Room was clean. Would definitely visit again. Great location. Regular complimentary shuttle bus to Universal/City Walk. Short subway journey to The Walk of Fame.  Only negative. We thought parking was a little expensive at $28 per night and $50 per night deposit that has to be paid upfront and you have to wait 14-28 days to be reimbursed.;5
We spent four nights at this hotel at the start of a 6 week trip around North America and Canada that we organised ourselves. We chose the hotel due to its proximity to Universal Studios (a 10 minute walk) and to Hollywood which is about a 6 kilometre drive. The Universal City Walk across the road had a variety of nice places to eat as an alternative to the hotel.  We arrived early afternoon and didn't realistically expect to be able to check in until 3.00pm. The nice lady at reception, Linda, could not have been more friendly or accommodating and after a bit of investigation, she put us into a room in a slightly higher category with a view over Universal Studios and we checked in early after the long flight from New Zealand.  The hotel was lovely. We had a nice dinner one night;5
Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 6 days in April 2018 and was really impressed!! The hotel looks really nice and modern inside and the rooms were great. Being so close to Universal Studios was amazing. There's a shuttle bus that comes every 15 minutes from 9am-9pm which drops you off at the park, which takes about 2 minutes. We ended up going to Citywalk most evenings for dinner as it was so close. There's a gift shop that sells drinks/snacks which was very handy. All the hotel staff were really friendly and polite too. We visited Venice Beach, Santa Monica Pier, Beverly Hills and Malibu during our stay, and the longest drive took us 45 minutes, so location really is spot on. The Hollywood sign is a 5-10 minute Uber drive away as well. We loved LA so will definitely come;5
My wife and I attended a 3 day convention and every thing was top notch.  Had a very convenient and short walk to Universal Studios and the attached street mall.  Great view of the inside of Universal Studios Theme Park from some rooms and views of the surrouding foothils from the other rooms.  Only oddity was the walk way from the lobby/elevator area was lined on both sides with buffet food.  If I was eating there I would not want everyone not eating walking within inches of all the food I was planning on eating.  Very attractive food displays I must say though.  The business center computer would not print my boarding pass but a very helpful staff member took me to his office and let me use his setup.;5
We needed a hotel for the night for our layover in LA. The hotel is within walking distance of the airport (itâs a straight shot from the baggage claim level, ignore your GPS if it takes you up Sky Way). The room was amazing and the staff were friendly and helpful.;5
"Manhattan, Chicago, San Francisco have nothing on Hollywood. Had airlines not been available, having had such a splendid stay here, my wife and I would have gladly walked the distance to have been here. I was having such a euphoric time gazing at the bikini clad babes around the champagne sparkling pool, I missed my tour bus. Later that evening, my wife was dazzled at the 1160 bar with Hollywood hunks half my age paying her so much attention and as a result, for the first time ever in our 20+ years of marriage, my wife recommended we probably should start taking separate vacations! .  There are two types of people in this ""city of angels"" and streets of dreams: 1. stars and 2. those who are about to become stars. My wife and I both agreed while staying at this fabulous Hollywood";5
We stayed here for 3 nights in the lotus room. Everything here is terrific. The service, rooms, breakfast and hammam.   Everything here is perfect. Look no further. Just book.   Take a look at the other 1000+ reviews;5
Wow! Unbelievable service and the entire staff could not have been more accommodating! As the staff said, this is your home and we want you to relax and enjoy! From the beautiful courtyards to the magnificent roof top pool and dining, this should be a âmust stayâ when in Marrakech! Excellent location in the Medina, close to everything that you would want to do. Again, the service levels at this Riad are completely above and beyond any place that I have ever stayed in the world and i have been to plenty 5 star properties! You will not be disappointed!!;5
We had the pleasure of having Pil help us during our stay. He made us feel welcomed and it really added to our overall experience with the city. The rooms were clean and overall a very good stay. Thank you The Hollywood Hotel and Pil for making our stay truly enjoyable.;5
For a local congress they advised me Hilton, price ++. This hotel is 20 minutes walking from faculty house at Columbia University. Near entrance metro 1,2,3 at 96th street upper west site. Room spacy, carpet too old, but bed matrasses and shower great,thatâs what I need to sleep well. Front desk friendly , furniture outdated, bet price quality very good, also for a longer tourist trip to the city. I never include breakfast in such a hotel, enough choice for breakfast nearby . Overall good place , needs some upgrade, otherwise good.;5
I just love this hotel. The location is excellent, opposite to The Lincoln Center, next to the Central Park and in walking disctance to the countless shops. Perfect! The Staff has been very kind every time I've visited the hotel during seven years. Empire is my hotel in New York. I'm coming back again this fall.;5
We had the absolute pleasure of meeting Ms Maria Garcia at the wee hours of the morning. She was beyond exceptional in assisting us with our late night dilemmas. Maria was professional, polite, and knowledgeable of the area and best options for our needs. On behalf of my guys and  I, we would like to profoundly thank Maria for making our first time stay a memorable one.   Maurice Howell.;5
Enjoyed the rooftop bar, the free concerts across the street at Lincoln Center, walking distance to Central Park. Great stay! Clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly. Free WiFi ! Will recommend !;5
We were here over Christmas 2012, value for money, clean and comfy rooms, easy to get to anywhere from the hotel. We loved New York and our stay in the hotel. Rooms  bar fridge food a bit pricey but great shops just downstairs. We had a Starbucks take away coffee and snack for breakfast every morning.(just down stairs) We did not have the best view from the window but the TV had live web cam feeds, great idea. I Recomend Empire Hotel.;5
This hotel was absolutely amazing! My best friend and I spent a week in NYC for graduation, and the Woogo was the perfect place for us to stay! We felt like we were literally living in NYC for a week. Everyone was so helpful with everything... I had even left my cell phone at home and had it mailed to me, and they made sure that I got it as soon as it arrived. Both the staff of the hotel and the security for the apartment building were fantastic. The room itself was perfect... the bed was super comfortable, and since the weather outside was so hot, we always had our room like an ice cube which was great to come home to every day. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! :);5
Me and my wife just finished our 14 day trip to Morocco and ended our journey at Riad Kheirredine. Let me just say that this was the highlight of our journey. The staff was genuine and extremely helpful. The location was great and we had no problem finding our way around. The property is VERY well kept and the drinks/food was fantastic. All in all, when we return to Marrakesh, this will be where we stay.;5
Weâve stayed here twice on nights when we had tickets for the Met, and itâs incredibly convenient... immediately across the street (which is especially awesome because it rained both of these times). The hotel has a rather loud, modern, lounge-like decor... the finishes are a little cheap/worn, but itâs still a great deal for the neighborhood. Service was good and everything was clean.;5
Great location in a lovely area, very close to Central Park, metro and opera house. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms kept very clean by housekeeping staff. Everywhere in walking distance, doormen really friendly and great characters indeed.;5
This hotel was more beautiful in person than even their website could portray.  It is very well maintained.   Very clean rooms.   Efficient, timely housekeeping.   The Concierge was very helpful and patient.   The location was perfect for our time in New York...easy access to subways, shopping, Lincoln Center and great restaurants.   I could not have been more pleased.;5
Our stay at the Ameritania was incredible. The stay started off with Chris checking us us in to a Junior Suite. When I tell you that this is by far the largest room I have ever stayed in during any of my many visits to NYC, understand that I also mean that it was bigger than my niece's NYC apartment! The lobby is fun & funky - a perfect welcome to NYC.  The rooms are beautifully appointed - clean, calming and comfortable. It's a good thing we saw Mean Girls (right around the corner!!) the day we arrived - I absolutely did not want to get out of bed in the morning because the mattress was so comfy. And the bathroom ... dear me, the bathroom is gorgeous & the shower is heavenly! That rainwater shower head made me want to re-do my master bath at home. In addition to the wonderful;5
"Stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days while in NYC over the Thanksgiving holiday.  I stay here often; itâs my âgo toâ place when in the city.  Great place!!  People are friendly, service is very good at checkin, though they gat busy at times ( like all hotels will ).  Special room requests are met quickly. Itâs a great place to stay when in midtown Manhattan, especially for an event at MSG.";5
Itâs a cute place to stay in LA Daniel at front Desk super helpful â­ï¸ â­ï¸ â­ï¸ â­ï¸ â­ï¸ And a nice person,smiling and very respectful staff  Happy I choose this place to stay  I definitely recommend Hollywood hotel to stay in;5
This is our 2nd visit to this hotel. This visit was good with just a few minor complaints. Our upgraded room was smaller than we expected. The construction made the elevators painfully slow but having staff help the elevators did help. The beds were so comfortable! The breakfast buffet was very good but the dinner seafood buffet was phenomenal!! Our girls really enjoyed the pool. The gym was better than we expected with modern equipment. The staff was very nice and perky. This hotel is right across the street from Universal Studios which was the purpose of our visit. The bar area is nice and cozy! We love this place and will return next year in October.;5
We have just returned from our stay at Riad Kheirredine.  From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and made to feel at home, and we were continued to be well looked after during our stay.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were helpful,  pleasant and polite.  Our transfers were all arranged for us and our room clean with everything we needed.  The staff were happy to make bookings and recommendations for restaurants making our stay an easy one, they even offer a service to have a staff member walk you to various key points until you orientate yourself, which given the complexity of the medina is helpful in your first 24hrs.  Our bed was comfortable and breakfast was varied with different fruits and cakes each day.   Would recommend a stay here if you are;5
I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank Hugo, Juan, and Sonia for the very professional service that they so graciously afforded my wife and I during our holiday stay last labor day! It won't be the last time we stay at the Hollywood Hotel as this is the best hotel in the neighborhood!;5
My Husband booked this Riad as a surprise minimoon and 'Wow' from the moment you walk in the service, rooms, roof pool, food, spa all exceed expectations. I was unsure how we would be getting around Marrakesh and the Souks in particular but the Riad provide maps and a mobile telephone (for if you get lost) and a guide to walk you to locations to venture from. They also provide great advice so as not to fall victim to common cons from some locals. Nothing is too much trouble, breakfast at any time in the day, unlimited bottled water, dinner on our private balcony with each course being brought up and cleared away. Just fantastic. The location is away from the main souks but with the guides and amazing restaurants just around the corner it makes this a fantastic base and a;5
My partner and I stayed at the Riad Kheirredine in November for approx. 8 days and we had a fabulous experience with staff ensuring everything was perfect and customised to meet our expectations. A staff member greeted us upon arrival and went through what we would like to do during our stay and if we needed anything organised. Breakfast could be had at anytime (very convenient for us as we were waking up at 1PM quite often!) and was always a large spread. We were always chatting to reception who felt more like friends and were always ready to help, particularly with remembering my boyfriend was addicted to Moroccan tea with sugar and biscuits! The room was beautifully prepared and dinner (particularly the lamb tagine) was delicious. There was absolutely nothing at fault and;5
Good hotel for the price parking was a pit pricey but other than that this place is a good bargain. Nice firm bed and a beautiful yard between the hotel with a view. Just want to say thanks again to Brian.;5
We stayed here for 3 nights & this hotel has the best location! Next to Penn Station, in front of Madison Square Garden,  walking distance to good restaurants & mostly everything that we wanted to visit including Broadway. 4 of us were really cramped in the room with 1 bed only in the 1st night but they then managed to move us to different room with 2 beds on the next day. The room is small compared to hotel rooms in other cities but we expected that already and still enjoyed our stay there. No complain for a room with Empire State Building view. We will definitely be back. Thank you, Wyndham New Yorker!;5
The New Yorker has great location, service and rate.  We had a room on the 37th floor with a great view of the city. Yes, the room was small but it was spotless and the bed was super cozy! The staff was friendly and attentive. We would definitely stay again. Also, be sure to check out the Tick Tock diner for breakfast and New York Pizza Suprema nearby.;5
My hotel's restaurants have been closed down due to the pandemic but I had a long day and didn't want to go out.  So staff suggested 2kfood.com for dinner.  My cheese burger was cooked to perfection with Swiss, and buttery melt in your mouth mushrooms and onions.  Also I splurged on dessert which I rarely do and got the peanut butter brownies with chocolate syrup, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  The perfect end to a perfect meal.  Plus they delivered it quickly to make hotel room.  Splendid!;5
I would book this hotel over and over again. Itâs clean, comfortable and accessible to airport. The staff is very friendly and professional. They always make you feel very welcomed every time I visit.;5
This was the best hotel experience I have ever had. The staff feels like family that you will come to love for their warmth and hospitality.  With all the amazing things there are to do in Morocco, staying at Riad Kheirredine proved to be the highlight of our trip :);5
We are Halloween crazies and My daughter and I had the best stay ever this time. Hotel is so convenient. We had a clean, really comfy room with a great view of Universal Studios. The alcove rooms are quite spacious. Staff is always very friendly & accommodating especially when we fly in on a red eye every year. The front desk makes every effort to make sure weâre comfortable waiting for check in. The restaurant breakfast buffet is pretty decent with good selection. The shuttle service to Universal is a must have especially late at night when the Halloween Horror Nights stay open until 2 am. See ya again next Halloween!!!;5
Victor was amazing! Great service and gathered everything I needed for my team to succeed. He was so helpful and kind, love to see such great staff! If I could bring him back with me to Boston, I one hundred percent would!!;5
Here for a short break and my wife's and my first trip to the city that never sleeps. After are relitively short trip from Newark airport we arrived to a lovely reception and staff.   The room was spacious clean neat tidy but ear plugs definitely needed as the night time traffic was loud,but noticeably quieter at the weekend. Plenty to do and see and we did the usual places to see here, statue of liberty, time square, ground zero etc all easy to get to by metro or walk as u see so much more.   We'll be coming back and if u have ANY questions or issues chat to Jeff who's always on the door as you arrive. The man is a mind field of information about newyork.  Enjoy. .;5
We had a fabulous time here. Very central. Across the road from penn station. Very easy to get to from jfk. Minutes from empire state, maceys, time square and broadway to name a few!! Tick tocks restaurant is great although they are cheeky waiting for their tips!!  We would deff stay here again;5
"Iâm not surprised to see that this place is the #1 rated hotel in Marrakech: It is absolutely extraordinary in every way. We came here for five nights to celebrate my fiancÃ©eâs birthday; I suppose she must have mentioned the occasion when making the reservation, but even so it was quite a surprise the morning of the actual birthday as we were finishing up our (as usual, glorious) breakfast beside the garden pool when the staff arrived with a specially made cake singing âHappy Birthday.â I wish I could have said that I had requested the special treatment, but no: It was the Riadâs staff exhibiting the remarkable thoughtfulness they bring to everything they do. It is no exaggeration to say that I have never experienced better service in a lifetime of travel (by a long shot). The";5
another wonderful stay at the Empire Hotel  beautiful hotel wonderful views fantastic service the most comfy beds in New York this hotel has it all. We cannot wait to come back! thanks Empire Hotel!  terrific!;5
I went with my 16 year old daughter for an extended weekend to NYC. The Jane offered reasonable rates, a friendly informative staff and great amenities. We went in knowing we would be in a cozy room and shared bathroom. We were pleasantly surprised with the cozy beds, great room air conditioning and the best shower ever! It is obvious that the owners of the hotel put a lot of thought into the balance of comfort and minimalism. If you are looking for fun with friends or kids, the Jane is the place to be. Don`t forget to check out the bar for its surviving parlor! Gatsby would be jealous!;5
Easy access to the sites. Walking distance to Macy's and the center of Times Square.Subway extremely close by. Good value for the area. My first trip to New York and I will definitely return and use this hotel.;5
Personal very friendly, rooms was cleaned every day, hotel is the near of the time square and the center park. The only bad thing was in the night. The room is in the night to cold. The bathroom hasn't a locker.;5
Nick checked me in and started the experience on a wonderful note.  So if you are staying there, make sure to say hi to Nick.  Highly recommend The Empire -- great location, room was nicely appointed, bar was cool atmosphere to meet up.  Dennis was out front helping us with getting around town - another great person there.  Had a wonderful time - thank you!;5
Good service fast and easy  pil was very nice and the room was beautiful nothing to complain about would recommend the jacuzzi suit been working so hard it was nice for them to hook me up with this suit;5
We were treated sooo nicely in this beautiful Riad. Every detail is well-thought. Driver from / to the airport for a resonable price. Assistance with the luggage from the taxi parking through narrow pedestrian streets of Marrakech. Attentive staff, ready to explain and help with everything. We even had our room covered with rose petals because I briefly mentioned about our anniversary in the coming days.  That is a royal treatment. Whatever you want - just ask. Morrocan tea in the room, wine on an extremely beautiful terrace with Atlas view. They speak English and French, owner is Italian. Normally, they offer you a phone to be in touch with a hotel if you get lost or someone to accompany you at least to the parking lot. However, being a bit independent, we explored the city on;5
This hotel was very well located with close walking to the things we wanted to do. The beds were really comfortable, the staff was great. They were on top of things before we even knew we needed them. It was just far enough from the crowds at Times Square to be less noisy, but close enough to walk there easily.  I loved that it was so close to Central Park and the art museums.;5
Whenever I have tickets for something at Madison Square Garden, and will be taking the train to NYC, I stay here.  It is in very close walking distance to both MSG and Penn Station.  The staff are professional and accommodating.  The hotel is beautiful, decorated in an Art Deco style.  It has an adjoining restaurant (The Tick Tock Diner) with good food that is also reasonable.  The hotel's price is pretty fair for this location and a good value.;5
This a great hotel. Big rooms with outstanding views whichever way you face. Staff are super helpful and both the cafe and restaurant and good quality. A 5 minute walk to universal or the shuttle is never too far away. I would definitely recommend staying here if you would rather not stay in the hustle and bustle of downtown LA or Hollywood.;5
We've stayed in a few really nice hotels but the level of service in these others hotels comes nowhere close to what we received in Riad Kheirredina. In some amazing way, all the staff members were fully informed of our plans throughout the entire stay and everybody took great care of us. The staff is truly amazing. They were at all times one step ahead of us, whether it was handing out water bottles when we're heading out to the souks or booking a restaurant for us just in case we'd decide to eat out one night. And all this service with a big smile on their faces no matter the hour of the day. The staff takes pride in making sure your stay is as perfect as possible and makes all problems go away before you even think about them. If I could give 6 stars to the staff I would.;5
It is just two blocks from Metro Station, very convenient location. House-keeping has done a good job, I saw her cleaning every concern of the room's door. It would be even better if it can provide a safes.;5
The hotel was impeccably immaculate. Very quiet and relaxing. Food was also very good. Room service was âfit for a kingâ!  The staff was extremely accommodating!  If we ever visit Universal Studios again, there is no doubt we will stay at this hotel!!;5
We had a wonderful four night stay.  Everything was perfect.  I will definitely stay again.  Only thing that we has difficulty with was connection with the Internet . It disconnected and consistently asked us to reconnect with the wifi and wouldn't save the hotel password which was a little bit of a hassle but nothing we couldn't handle.  Wifi was free and that was wonderful;5
we stayed here for 3 nights so we could do universal studios VIP tour and warners and see Kodak and Chinese theatre while we at the chines theatre we done the star line hop on hop off bust the hotel is great had all you needed the rooms where nice and clean and the hotel had a shuttle which took you to universal city- Studio;5
This is the closest hotel to LAX.  They are soooooo welcoming, sooooo professional.  They are just want you want before or after a flight.  Shuttles to the airport run every 15 minutes.  The windows are soundproof so you donât feel like youâre at an airport hotel. High recommend.  If you havenât joined their loyalty program, do so.  There is a reason why they have a great reputation.  Experience it here.;5
I received a warm welcome and wonderful customer service from Daisy at the front desk. She made the stay comfortable. Rooms are pretty standard, but good value for the price.  Good central LA location.;5
The hotel took care of every single detail of our stay, including fruits and cookies at the room, booking all our taxi and dinners and providing full support during our trip. Every corner is a photo must and the food was delicious. I am having hard time to find something that I didn't like. They have swimming pool, spa (which we did enjoy) and many areas to relax or have a meal. The rooms have no TV on purpose to avoid disturbing your rest.  The views at night from the terrace are spectacular.  I definitely recommend this place when you stay in Marrakech.;5
This is our go-to hotel when we are in NYC. The location is phenomenal, the hotel is very clean. It has a 24 hour restaurant/bar and great customer service. Why stay anywhere else? I recently had an issue with a cancellation and called the reservations department who were very helpful. They transferred me to the front desk and I was fortunate enough to get connected to Neida! She was so helpful! Very friendly and efficient. She handled the issue quickly and so professionally!  Thanks Neida- I will be sure to say hi in person on our next visit!;5
Stayed for 10 days in this wonderful hotel. I have zero complaints, the room was large with 2 double beds, very very clean, modern decor, comfy beds, blackout blinds & curtains, windows that open, the room was fitted with everything we needed & more.The bathroom was well stocked & had 2 shower heads, handheld & rain.  We were on the 12th floor across from the elevators which I thought would be noisy but was pleasantly surprised, some street noise can be heard early in the morning & sometimes late at night but this was expected this as we are in the heart of uptown. The location is perfect for walking, subways, restaurants, theatre, shopping and sightseeing.   The staff was the best part of our stay, always professional and at your service. At the front door Jeff was super;5
We had booked four nights originally for May 2020 at Riad Kheirredine & due to Covid finally arrived there on the 25th April 2022.   Well what can I say but WOW, this is such a fabulous Riad. We were met at the airport for our transportation into the Medina and then a staff member will meet you to walk you the short distance to the property.  We were then met my Sara who after mint tea and refreshments showed us around.   Our room was upgraded to a junior suite âLotusâ which was beautiful, super comfy bed & gorgeous products in the bathroom. Robes and slippers were also provided.  The first night we had dinner at the Riad which was a traditional menu with Tagine, Moroccan wine was very nice too.  Breakfast the following morning was taken on the terrace which was a delight with;5
I chose this hotel because of its location and price and wasnât disappointed but mostly I think the staff deserve a mention.   From reception staff to breakfast staff to bar staff they were all very  friendly and helpful.;5
The staff were amazing and when we mentioned it was our anniversary we received a card and a bottle in our room, the staff at breakfast again were very helpful, breakfast was great   Our only complaints are, for the cost of the room we felt the bathroom was small and needs updating, our biggest issue were the pillows, we had lots of them however they were totally flat when you laid on them, they really need to invest in new ones  Overall we enjoyed our stay;5
Just stayed for 3 nights in this beautiful Riad. Don't stay anywhere else. Firstly the staff are amazing, they could not be more helpful in arranging tours of the city, dinner reservations, providing tips for the souks and ensuring the drinks keep arriving. They provided you with a phone if you get lost, keep in contact with taxi drivers and even send you with a chaperone if you are not sure of the way at no cost. From arrival to departure there was nothing they couldn't help with and went out of their way to do so.  The Riad is authentic and beautiful with multiple terraces and rooms hidden away everywhere. We felt like we had a terrace and several day beds to ourselves and loved soaking up the sun after a day of exploring the city.  Breakfast on the terrace is idyllic and you;5
We are local to the area but wanted a night out to celebrate my birthday.  The hotel was fantastic!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable.  Crabtree and Evelyn bathroom products.  We walked to City Walk for dinner (it's not a short walk - fyi).  Would stay there again without a doubt.;5
The Hyatt has been redone and is perfection!  Finally, a hotel that was innovative enough to get rid of those massive dresser draws and a bathtub!  Not to worry though, there are 3 drawers and a hanging wardrobe area and a shower head and a handheld one if you have kids!   Friendly, beautiful and convenient!!!;5
On April 27, 2022 my family and I arrived at the Hilton due to me having to attend a business conference. The scenery is truly tranquil. The hotel was clean, the rooms were a spacious size, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating.   We had our first night dinner at the hotelâs Five on the Hill. My dad and husband enjoyed the roasted nuts. For our daily breakfast we dined at the hotelâs  Cafe Sierra. They offered buffet and an a la carte menu. The prices and plate portions were definitely worth it.   Also there is a free shuttle from the hotel that will take you to Universal Studios City Walk. Thatâs where my dad and husband would go while I was attending my conference seminars.   We definitely will stay here again for future trips to Los Angeles.;5
We loved our stay here!  We never met one cranky staff member. What a treat to find helpful people everywhere we turned. Our room was so clean and welcoming. The food at the restaurant is pricey as you'd expect. The amazing Sunday buffet was $48?  We did not eat it but it was the most amazing spread I've ever seen. Pool was clean and lots of chairs and chaises. Attentive staff there as well.  Lots of people had breakfast vouchers...we did not receive those.  Not sure how one acquires those.  The only issue was elevator service.  They are renovating, but there's no gigantic mess.  When I made my reservation, I mentioned that I'd read some complaints of slow elevator service but was told by the reservation person that she knew nothing of that. It was an issue. One lady got on and;5
This was an excellent location and with friendly, helpful staff. The Room was bigger than the average NYC room which was quiet and clean. Beds were comfortable with crisp white sheets, with  AC fairly quiet.;5
A beautifully remodeled property. The rooms are nicely appointed for up to the minute needs. Everything has been thought of here. There are three different parking options. The bar serves great drinks and the servers are very friendly. Thereâs a breakfast buffet and if spending 30.00 for a single guest is OK then you will enjoy it very much..;5
The room was great! Comfortable, spacious, clean, and friendly staff.  Breakfast was not the best at the executive lounge.  Other than that it was awesome!  It was a perfect airport hotel and I would stay at the same location again.;5
Stayed here for two nights around Christmas time and have nothing but great things to say about this place. First, our room was clean and spotless. The staff was very helpful in providing necessary assistance as well as the hospitality not often seen today. The complimentary daily breakfast was also excellent particularly during our 2-night stay there.. If you are planning to visit the Sunset Strip and/or go to Universal Studios, staying here would especially be convenient for you.  I highly recommend. Great hotel for a relatively affordable price.;5
"My family of 5 adults (my wife and I and 3 adult children) stayed for 8 days in late September 2018. We booked 3 suites, the Imperial suites called ""Musk"" and "" Sandal"" and the ""Verveine Suite"".  All were extremely clean and very well appointed with Moroccan themed couches, chairs, beds, carpets and wall decorations. All rooms cleaned twice a day and bottled water and fresh fruits replenished daily. Complimentary daily laundry service. Leave your dirty clothes in a designated laundry bag in your room in the morning, the clean clothes are returned that evening. They iron your undershirts!. It is clean, efficient, and quick.    The Imperial suites each have 2 balconies (one small and one very large) overlooking a courtyard.    As a result of connection delays in Casablanca we were";5
From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we couldnât fault the excellent attitude, friendliness and service at this very busy London hotel.  Despite it being one of the busiest weekends with London Pride, the Rolling Stones, Adele and Wimbledon and the hotel full, there was always a member of staff going there extra mile for us to make our stay so enjoyable.  A case in point â¦ I wanted some lemon and couldn't see any on the breakfast bar so I asked a member of staff (her name was Dana) if she could help.  With a great attitude and a winning smile, she came back within minutes with a full size lemon for me.  Another member of staff went out of her way to locate a particular location for us with a willingness to help which way exceeded our expectations.  The room was;5
Excellent place to stay-no complaints whatsoever!;5
Gorgeous, clean hotel with an awesome, friendly staff. We were unsure on places to eat or visit until we got into a good convo with the doorman I think his name was Tommy great guy and he was very helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a couples get away had a great time.;5
Just returned from 4 night visit to Marrakech with family to celebrate a special anniversary. The Riad is very attractive in traditional Morroccon style, the terraces have lovely views and comfy seating areas in the shade ( which we needed as it was hot last week) Staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and willing to organise trips etc. The guide that they use is really good and we did a full day trip of Marrakech with him. Would be happy to return again and would recommend to others!;5
Was the best i liked a lot.  Very good hospitality and an excellent service, if your'e any where near pay them a visit,  What i liked the most is the fact that i really has everything taken care of so at the end of the day, who needs more ?;5
"From the arrival to the departure our stay at the Riad Kherreidine was marvelous.  The staff holds the highest standard I've ever experienced and I can compare with stays in luxury resorts on all continents!  Always ready to provide service of any kind, whether it's bringing you food or beverages, give advise or follow you back and forth to destinations in the Medina.  Our room (the ""Sandal"" suite with private balcony) was a dream and the roof terrace a perfect place to unwind with a drink or a meal after a busy day in or outside of the town.  We're bringing very nice memories from the Riad Kherreidine and want to thank again the owner and staff for making our visit a near perfect experience.  This is definitely the place to be when visiting Marrakesh";5
After staying in many places and many hotels, I cannot even begin to say how totally amazing my stay was in the Riad. Yes, the pathway to the Riad may of been slightly daunting for a late arrival but this little paradise was worth every step there! The staff couldn't do enough, all with character, humour, kind and caring attitudes and the most beautiful of surroundings. (Not one member of staff from the receptionists to the cleaners to the bellboys to the waiters could have done more!)  I enjoyed breakfast on the rooftop terrace every morning which was a feast fit for a queen with different pastries each morning to entice me to eat them. The chef was worthy of this beautiful Moroccan with an Italian twist (Italian owned) and couldn't to enough to please my taste buds. The rooms;5
Stayed at the ameritania for 4 nights it was a double double room which had really comfy beds and a great rain shower very clean and great housekeeping. Jeff and his other colleagues on the door were always helpful and offer a great service in ensuring your return journey pick up is arranged and offers peace of mind thanks for all your help;5
My wife and I moved from another Riad to stay 3 nights at the Riad Kheirredine.  From the time we came over to view the Riad to the day we left, we had a great time.  Service is important to them and it shows!  Hakim and all the guys there truly make a difference you will experience if you visit them.  Taking you to show you the way personally, walking you to and from restaurants to dinner, and the wonderful dinner we had at the Riad all made our stay great and positively impacted our impression of Marrakech.  If/when you go, be sure to watch the sunsets from the roof while drinking mint tea or a glass of wine!  As someone else said, this is an oasis of calm amidst the busyness of the city.  Thanks to everyone for making our stay memorable!;5
Just completed a three night stay with my wife and I am glad to report that the Empire has maintained its excellent quality. There has been some change-over in the staff, however the new front desk manager, Kathleen Herman-Mathurin, was responsive, courtesy and generous. Can't beat that. We still like the north -acing rooms which offer nice views of the holiday lights up Broadway and Columbus Avenue. On the spur of the moment, we strolled over to Lincoln Center, 60 seconds away, and were able to get tickets for Verdi's Requiem, which was just about to start. The Empire vibe is a good one.;5
A friend of mine and I were visiting LA for an awards show and booked this hotel because of the central location of where our meetings and events were. The staff, especially Brian and Nicole, were so personable and nice!  Brian recommended places nearby to walk to that would have a decent bourbon selection. Our room was clean, and the only sound we heard was when the cleaning crew pushed their card down the hall, and that wasnât bad. It seemed like a hidden gem, and we were thrilled with the experience. If youâre wanting a clean room, this is your spot. It isnât the newest or trendiest, but itâs been renovated and serves the purpose. Iâll be back!;5
We arrived a few hours earlier than the check in time. The front desk guy let us store our luggage in the storage room, while me and my girlfriend explored the city! The room was bigger and better than we expected. The subway is walking distance from this hotel. I really enjoyed my stay here, this will be my go to spot whenever im in New York.;5
This is the riad that I would suggest if asked where to stay in Marrakech. We had a very early arrival time and the riad went out of their way to accommodate us at 3am. It was actually the riad that noticed the time discrepancy and thank goodness because we were exhausted after our trip and we wouldve been stranded. The amenities were beautiful and the rooftop had an inspiring view for dinners, drinks, and a wonderful complimentary breakfast.  Elena and the staff at the riad worked very hard and provided us an unforgettable experience. CHEERS!;5
Review WYNDHAM NEW YORKER- STAYED AUGUST 29,2018  Great hotel for the money. I have stayed at the New Yorker before and was not disappointed this time either. I am 83 years old and traveling alone. Prior to my stay, I called and asked for early entry so that I could take a nap prior to attending the show, Pretty Woman. I was told that it could not be promised but that they would do what they could to accommodate me. When I arrived at the hotel there was no one at the Rewards Desk. There were about thirty people in line for registration. I could not stand in that line and could not get anyone to help me. I noticed, Crystal standing behind the Wyndham Vacations Desk which had nothing to do with registration. I said to her, âWould you please help me? I am 83 years old and too weak;5
Great place to stay during the holidays. Very clean and safe special right now during the pandemic you can never be too careful. Wonderful staff, Pil at the front desk so helpful. Sad no free breakfast because of the pandemic, but can't wait to come back.;5
Our second stay which was as wonderful as the first. A place to relax and unwind from stresses of work. Thanks to all the fantastic staff for making our vacation a memorable one. We will be back very soon.;5
Arrived late last night, the hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly, my room was upgraded to a bigger one, and had a deliciously hot shower and tumbled into the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Though it's on a noisy street I couldn't hear a thing (third floor). It's right by Carnegie Hall, the Ed Sullivan Theatre and MoMA. recommended!;5
Third time to NYC, first time at this hotel. One block to the west of Central Park, lovely restaurant at the property and several places across the road. Roof top bar/restaurant was stunning. Even had a smoking area, very rare in NYC.;5
Outstanding location for the business traveler. Eventhough it was right at the airport, the rooms were comfortable, stylish and quiet. Staff was courteous and friendly. Overall, visit was a good experience.;5
I had never heard of the hotel and was a bit hesitant but the price and reviews were were so good I had to give it a try. I requested a quiet room and was given a nice, albeit  small room facing an alley. It was more than adequate for the less than 12 hours I was in the room. The bathroom was modernized and had a nice big shower. TV was out of service when I got to the room at 12:30 and in the AM, it was working but not well. Other than that, I couldn't have been happier. Staff very helpful and friendly. I did not eat the breakfast as I had other plans. To be that close to the park and TImes Square (but not too close to the Square) for that price you'd be crazy to go anywhere else.;5
The reviews do not lie:  This place is a true gem!  Rooms and grounds are clean, tastefully decorated, and spacious.  I believe the riad was fully booked during our 3-night stay, but there was more than enough space to avoid overhearing other guests' conversations.  Food was delicious:  try the Moroccan dinner and garlic, onion, and tomato omlette for breakfast.  We stayed in two rooms here: - Canelle, which is in the new section of the riad, on the terrace with the new pool.  This room is lovely and the shower big, but it does face some heavy sun in the middle of the day, so it can get toasty in there.  There is a nice, personal sitting area right outside the bedroom for two. - Ambra, which is in the old section of the riad, up 3 flights of windy staircase.  I really liked the;5
We just needed a hotel for a one night stay near LAX and my research on TripAdvisor didnât disappoint! An easy 1.2km walk (20 mins which was nice after a long haul flight), or there is a shuttle bus if you prefer that. Rooms are a very good size and incredibly sound proof considering how close you are to the airport, good showers and comfortable beds and pillows. Check in was efficient, staff friendly and a good sports bar downstairs for a drink and feed. Would stay here again for sure.;5
Nice location for business or tourist travel. Parking is $17;5
This hotel was grrrrreattttttt. I depends on what you are after and if thats a basic, good location, friendly staff - this is the one. If you want more than that then you need to spend the money and do so. We stopped here from 22nd Apr 2011 until 28th Apr 2011, only got back a few days ago. Myself and husband stopped in one room, my sister and friend stopped in another.  The staff were excellent especially RE, he was a sweetheart. The rooms were basic but they had a TV, hairdryer, ironing board, their showers had great water pressure, realisticly  what more do you want considering your going to be out most the time checking out New York. When we had trouble putting the heating on they sent someone straight away, we asked for an iron they had someone bring it up to us, they have;5
Amazing hotel, location was fab right next to penn station and subway. Had a view of the Empire State from our room on the 29th floor. Room was a double double so plenty of room. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and hotel was clean and perfect for what we needed.;5
Regular user of Premier Inn, and never once been disappointed. Needed an emergency stay in London as we had missed our last train home. Very reasonably price, infact really good value for money in London. Warmly welcomed in the wee small hours. And as always, dark, dark room, lovely bed and bed linen, perfect nights sleep.;5
The room is comfortable and clean. The staff is helpful and friendly. The location is perfect. But the wall is thin and the sound travels so it's a little bit noisy. Also the water stream is small. However the overall experience is great.;5
For all the beauty this Riad beholds (absolutely stunning) it's the team and we emphasise team, because they truly are the ones to make this place special.  From airport pick-up to breakfast on the roof terrace, in any one of many stunning spots they have delicately designed, you will be wowed by how attentive, thoughtful, insightful, knowledgeable and caring the staff are.  Our time away couldn't have got off to a better start.  We were half expecting for this to taper off a little as we were new guests but it didn't.  The selfless and caring attitude became a theme for our Minimoon.  We were given the tour, a mobile phone (in-case we got lost) the option of a guide to show us key spots, maps, taxi's arranged, you name it, they sort it all for you.  Water is also complimentary;5
The Ameritania Hotel, is perfectly located for business needs, dining and shopping. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Rooms are large for NYC standards, the blackout blinds and heavy drapery drown out the soundsof the city and let you have a quiet night sleep, and the shower is amazing to wake you up before you leave :);5
Stayed here for a week whilst in the states for work, breakfast was excellent, giving really good options and live chefs in the open kitchen, room was brilliant, massive beds, great view of the mountains, and of the theme park. Concierge did a great job, hired us a car to get us around.  The only down side is the shop in the hotel is a touch pricey, and the lifts took a while to get to you.;5
Chose to stay here based purely on the excellent review on Trip Advisor - we weren't disappointed.  The Riad is lovely.  The management and all those who look after you were very attentive and showed a high level of personal engagement in your satisfaction and safety.  You will have read on other reviews about the location and that you are provided with a mobile phone.  This is supplemented by a personal guide walking you to and from nearby restaurants and taxi pick up points.  This service should be fully used by anyway staying there since we did experience a couple of locals trying to mislead us or seek a tip for helping us to find the Riad even though we didn't seek this help.  The Riad team was very understanding of this issue and encouraged us to use their guide service.;5
Great location, value and staff! Staff have always gone out of their way to accommodate my needs, whether it's an early check in or a late check out. The attached restaurants are excellent if timing won't allow you to venture further.;5
Daniel was so personable! His recommendations led me to falling in love with east Hollywood. El Zarape, 4100 bar, and the French bakery on mariposa were life changing!! Wish there were more people like him to help me find my way in a new city :);5
I was just stopping by for very early flight next morning. So, I didnât expect anything else, but location. Nothing to add for the location since it is very next to LAX. However, the staffs are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean to meet the name of Hyatt Regency. I will stay there again for sure.;5
I stayed with husband and children. The hotel was beautiful, clean and safe. The hotel room was more then we expected. The bathroom was the only area we had hoped would be more spacious. But overall worth the money and the location was very convenient to the city;5
Beautiful hotel. Staff was helpful and attentive. Valet parking was easy. Pool was clean and warm. Hot tub was amazing. Beds were comfy. Bathrooms big and clean. Quiet in room. Breakfast was delicious and there was a lot to pick from;5
Great hotel in historical building. Needed somewhere close to Penn Station and this was awesome! Friendly staff and I felt super at ease as a solo traveler. Lots of eating opportunities nearby. Will definitely stay again!!;5
My 12-year-old daughter and I stayed here May 2018. We stayed do to its close proximity to Universal Studios which is right across the street. It is approximately a five minute walk. You feel very safe before and after dark walking between the park and the hotel. We stayed in a large suite overlooking the park from the 19th floor. It offered awesome city views as well as the park. We had a kingking-size bed which was very comfortable and the room was absolutely gorgeous. The hotel is well-kept and very clean. The area surrounding the hotel is very lush with beautiful palm trees and a nice outdoor pool.  Kudos to âTim the doormanâ for his hospitality and the energy he brings. All in all this was a fantastic stay and we would highly recommend this place. FYI also another nice;5
The staff are more than helpful.  Very comfortable and clean room with a view of the Lincoln Center. Great location. Would be happy to stay here again.  Didn't have chance to try the rooftop bar this time - something for next time. The restaurant nextdoor is good and the Starbucks on  the corner was useful;5
This hotel is great from the actual building/ rooms, to the location, to the staff.  I have stayed here many times now and have no complaints.  I would especially recommend staying here if you are still failey new to NYC.  Also, Jeff is awesome, very helpful!;5
Love the design, the view, confortable bed and pillows, they think in all you will need so itâs nice to have a room waiting for you to enjoy. Thank you! I had a good time! See you soon! Thatâs for sure!;5
This hotel is just a block from Penn Station in NYC.  They have maintained the historic look and feel of the hotel.  The room was small but clean and i got a better deal when booking on the web page than I was offered when I called.  Would definitely stay there again.;5
Wonderful stay at the New Yorker Wyndham Hotel.  Situated  on 8th Avenue close to Times Square & Broadway. Subway right beside the hotel.  Staff very helpful & friendly. Room small but very clean & had everything we needed. Food outlets at the hotel very good. Adette from Ireland;5
I arrived at this hotel half way through my holiday, ( it was totally unplanned to stay here, but the service in the other hotel was a disgrace!). As I didn't plan on this stay, I could only afford a standard room with one bed, which I found great, it was just very small for myself and my sister and all our stuff, (typical women overpacking and shopping!). Although the room would be great for a single traveller. The comfort of the bed was great, I did notice that the sheets weren't changed daily though but thats only a minor complaint and could probably  be resolved with a phone call. After 2 nights the room was starting to feel a bit cramped so i went down to reception to ask for an upgrade, a guy called Mr ze was very helpful, he offered us a complimentary upgrade which;5
"Had an excellent one night stay at the Empire Hotel.  The location was fabulous...so close to Fordham Univ-Lincoln Center Campus where we were seeing a play that our daughter was in.  Lots of restaurants nearby and walking distance to so many NYC attractions...Lincoln Center, Central Park to name a few.  Check in and Check out was swift and efficient.  The room was clean and looked out over the city.  There were a few minor things that were ""run down"" in the room, but nothing to make our stay bad.  The rooftop bar is nice but EXPENSIVE!  2 drinks cost $35!  There were parking facilities less a than block away that cost $45 for the night --got ticket validated at check-in for this reduced rate.  I will definitely stay here again.";5
I was scheduled to work in the area and somehow managed to tweak a muscle in my back, ugh. On the road and lost much of my mobility. Fortunately I was at the Hollywood Hotel, with a super comfortable bed, quiet room and relaxing view. If I had to be down and resting a hundred miles from home, I couldnât be in a better place. Hot shower, comfortable chairs, great view of the garden and fountain. For an unscheduled rest area place, the Hollywood Hotel is the best. Good Wi-Fi and Chrome cast movies. And I was one block from the pharmacy, Staples and some easy access fast food and a Lyft ride to an evening resturaunt. You couldnât do better if you tried.;5
Stayed here for a long weekend with the fambam. We stayed on the 24th floor ( FYI...the higher you are the longer it takes the elevator to get up or down lol )... Room was nice we had the two bed executive. There is a mini fridge, desk, dresser and a good size closet in the room.the bathroom was nice ( clean ). The staff from the valet to the front desk to the people just holding the elevators open were all super friendly.  It takes only 5-10min walk to universal studios and universal city...;5
Wonderful location, a short walk to Central Park, 5th Avenue, Lincoln Center friendly efficient staff and a great place to stay in New York, plus the restaurant is superb, food sublime and staff are courteous;5
"My family and I had a great stay. The staff were very friendly and service oriented. The floral arrangements in the lobby was amazing. Our room has 2 beds which was comfortable for a family with children. Its close proximity to Universal Studios gave us great options for dining and shopping at City Walk; and the continuous shuttle service during the day till midnight was very convenient. It was within walking distance as well. The restaurant was family oriented; the daily breakfast buffet and their seafood buffet at weekends had fantastic choices.";5
Very great hotel, nice rooms and comfy beds. The hotel was located nicely almost next to the entrance of penn station. It was a bit a pity that the hotel rooms very very small, so if you are planning on staying with 4 people in a double queen room, I wouldn't do it and grab two rooms.;5
We chose this Riad after extensive research. Romantic anniversary trip was our reason. This gorgeous Riad is not far from the souks (you want to be close but not too close) and as we booked one of the luxury suites we had a private cell phone concierge to assure our safety and help us not get lost. You WANT that. The restaurant is wonderful and fresh juice, coffee, waters, anything you need during the day or night.  The service canât be over complimented as the entire staff is amazing and go out of their way to keep us comfortable at all times. We will be back and if you have any questions for us feel free! Well worth the money!;5
Thanks Sufia for your warm welcome, I had a nice stay close to Central Park and Times Squares. Room were clean, the staff very kind. Such a beautiful place to hang out in New York City.  See you again soon;5
My daughter had a 10 am curtain call at Carnegie Hall. We decided to stay the night before for a stress free transition from sleep to performance. We also booked the next night so we would have a base of operations. The level of service we required was vigorous. Vlad checked us in with ease and panache. The room was excellent. We didn't need a view but we did need comfortable beds and room for our Diva to get ready. Ameritania delivered. I called for ice and extra towels and there was a knock on the door with what I asked for almost as soon as I hung up.(amazing). I have to say the beds are out of this world. Vlad and Elana was an amazing, kind, efficient team.  I love when a plan comes together, thank you Ameritania for making that happen.;5
Had a great stay at the Hollywood Hotel, I was well taken care of, from check in with Mr. Pil and Brian who have a great chemistry together, both have a great sense of humor. Thank you Pil for the quick recommendation  for dinner and the bar Boucher. Do not skip on breakfast, it is filling. The Hollywood hotel meets and exceeds all expectations.;5
The service was incredible and nice felt like a family nice rooms great pool incredible service has a great sauna great wifi the beds are incredibly comfortable big bathrooms and pil the manager was of great help and assistance;5
This was our second stay at the Empire Hotel. The location is very convenient and off the major tourist routes. Located across from Lincoln Center and just down from Columbus Circle it is near two Subway stations and within walking distance of Central Park. You are two subway stops away from Times Square.   The Hotel is a classic 1920's building with a beautiful dark wood lobby. The rooms are a good size (for NY standards) with a small refrigerator (mini-bar).   The staff is courteous and friendly and housekeeping had our room cleaned quicker than just about any other hotel that I've stayed at (and I'm a frequent traveler).   The pool is tiny but the rooftop deck where it is located is really nice in the evening. The same goes for the rooftop bar.   We will definitely be back.;5
We loved this property! Stylish, while traditional, a tranquil oasis in the hustle and bustle of the Medina. We absolutely loved our suite (Yasmine) and the staff were all great. Loved the provision of the smart phone, with preset numbers and map location that ensured we felt secure and never got lost! We had a small mishap at the back end of our stay, however, Sara and her team went above and beyond to make it up to us in any way they could. Overall a wonderful experience and we're definitely coming back!;5
Weâve stayed in this hotel for years because itâs across the street from Lincoln Ctr and convenient to sites on Upper West Side, subway, and buses. Itâs become a really fine hotel with well-styled rooms, a roof-top CafÃ©/bar, and lobby bar. Staff are friendly and accommodating, particularly Maggie and Luis.;5
The hotel is located right in front of Lincoln Center. If you are in New York City for Opera performance this is the right place to be. The rooftop is very spacious with amazing views of the city.  Great prices for the location.;5
10 out of 10, one of our favorite hotels, customer service is great in every area, from housekeeping, valet,front desk, room service and everything in between. Perfect for family trips to Universal Studios.;5
From the moment I walked in the building everyone was extremely accomodating. My flight came in early, so I was worried about checking into my room. As I entered the lobby/check in area, a very sweet blonde lady helped me with my reservation. She was fast, had a great attitude, and she upgraded my room. When I got to my room, everything was extremely clean, the shower was amazing. The bed was perfect. I had absolutley everything I needed. The mini bar was fully stocked. Room service was fast and food was wonderful. As I checked out the next morning, again I saw the same lady. Again, everything was great and I headed to the airport.  My stay at the Empire Hotel, was wonderful. The surrounding area had some great restaraunts !!!.  Thank You;5
The BEST place to stay for Universal Studios! Wonderful hot or continental breakfast buffet, which I recommend purchasing with the room type, since 2 adults (continental) and 2 children (full, hot) are included. Itâs a $60 value. You can upgrade the adults to full, hot buffet for $10 each.  Convenient access to the park and Universal City Walk. We took the complimentary shuttle to the park, as it is an uphill walk, and we walked back to the hotel afterward, as itâs actually faster then waiting for the shuttle to come back around. Rooms were clean and updated, and our corner king w/sofa bed was roomy. I recommend requesting an upper floor for the amazing views. Great mini vacation!;5
We stayed in this Riad during a weekend trip to Marrakech and it was absolutely amazing! The rooms and the shared spaces are beautifully decorated and furnished. We really loved our imperial suite. The staff was very kind and gave all the best to make our stay perfect. Additionally, the riad is located in a very comfortable part of the medina as it is very quiet but still close (walking distance) to the main attractions. Overall, when coming back to Marrakech someday we will definitely stay again in this Riad.;5
We were a family of 4 travelling in Morocco, and Riad Kheirredine was our first stop.  It is a beautifully designed & serene riad a 10 minute walk from the souks.  While you give up that central proximity, the value is that you get to experience the quieter, non-touristy parts of the old medina, and the riad makes it very easy for you to navigate.  They give you a local cell phone pre-programmed with their number to use during your stay, and walk you to/from your destinations if needed (though we were excited to learn to navigate on our own, and felt really accomplished when we did).  Valentina, Yajaira, Youssef, Brahim, and all the staff took such good care of us, it was hard to say goodbye to them.  When the airline lost one of our bags, they took the time to help us call &;5
We stayed here over Christmas and the location of this hotel is perfect. It is the closest hotel to Universal City and it felt like a very safe area to walk around safe at night. It was very similar to a smaller scale version of Downtown Disney. We ate out at the many restuarants every night at UC and loved going to the studios. The hotel has a Starbucks and also it's own restuarant and convenience store. The rooms were nice and roomy and ours offered a spectacular view of the park. The only thing I could suggest they need is a guest laundry as the laundry room service at any resort is too expensive. Overall, this is the choice spot to stay as it is in a touristy area where many restuarants are at your need as well offering you the security to walk around at day or night safely.;5
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton.  When we come for productions at Universal we normally stay at the Sheraton but the added charges were getting to be too much for my liking.  From now on we will be staying at the Hilton next door.;5
We had a Queen Suite. There was a door onto the roof/balcony to see the City lights. Very enjoyable and most importantly, quiet. The beds are nice and cozy! We borrowed an umbrella from the front desk to use when it started raining.;5
We had a nice stay at The Empire Hotel. It's only two blocks from Central Park, so we were able to bring the kids there daily to play. It's only 3 blocks from Columbus Circle, so it was easy to travel into downtown via the subway. There isn't a lot for quick, lunch food nearby, but there is a Starbucks on the corner and a Dwayne Reade next to that, which was convenient. And, there's a rooftop bar a that hole, plus Smith's across the road which is a nice dinner restaurant. Overall, we were very happy with our choice!;5
We stay in Los Angeles for 2 nights wanted to be near universal studios the Hilton was right there. It was a perfect choice universal in walking distance close to Hollywood sign and other Los Angeles attractions.  Hilton was very clean staff was excellent and very accommodating.  We had a king corner room with excellent views of universal.  Only down side had to pay to park;5
I booked the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel for our stay in New York based partially on the good reviews it received on TripAdvisor, but also due to the convenient location.  My adult son and I were in New York for several days for some much-needed leisure time, and we wanted to do as many things as possible within walking distance.  This hotel fit the bill perfectly.  Our trip started out horribly, when an accident at the NY airport injured my son and resulted in our first day in the city being spent at the hospital.   By the time we finally checked into the hotel it was hours after our plane landed in New York.  We were frustrated, tired, hungry, and my son was in pain from his accident.   As we checked in with the reception desk, we were assisted by a wonderful man named Mohammad.;5
A great stay, the hotel was top notch from top to bottom.  We plan to stay there again on our next visit.!!!!  The location was perfect the staff was always friendly and helpful.  The room was very comfortable.;5
Just finished my business trip and was glad I choose The Empire Hotel to stay. Location to the subway stations and to Lincoln Center is amazing. Will come back again! The housekeeping manager Marco was great help as well.;5
The Empire Hotel was extremely convenient to Lincoln Center, subways and quality restaurants. I was concerned that I would hear the traffic at night but that was not the case! I loved the view from my room which faced the small park across the street.;5
"Stayed 3 nights, had a lovely room, Eucalyptus, which was very large and beautifully decorated in traditional style. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff, who did everything to make our stay relaxing. Opted for the transfers to and from the airport - a good idea as cars can only get to within about a 5 minute walk of the Riad, and you would never find the Riad on your own if you arrived in the dark. Had the dinner at the Riad on our first night; good selection of traditional food and huge portions, definitely worth doing.  Spent a good couple of days wandering around Marrakech, Riad is about 10 minutes walk from main square through a myriad of souks but not as difficult to find as you would initially think and the staff take you on the route the first day to help";5
Stayed in The Empire in October 2014 for 5 nights for my daughters 18th birthday. Our room was a double room (2 double beds) for the 3 of us. The room was a good size for New York we stayed at the Milford (now The Row) last time and that was much smaller. The bathroom is small but its New York what do you expect. The room was comfortable and clean our cleaner was lovely and even left chocolate strawberries on night. We had a flat screen with plenty of channels but to be honest we hardly watched it. We had breakfast in the hotel a few times and I am still dreaming of the pancakes they were amazing. Every member of staff that we came across was helpful and kind. Location is perfect right by Central Park and Columbus Circle so subway is easy to access. I would stay here again in a;5
We just returned from a fantastic visit to New York, and the staff at the New Yorker went above and beyond to make it so! I was traveling alone with my thirteen year old daughter and her bestie, so safety was at the top of my list. Before we ever left, I called a few times and spoke with both Ms. Naeda and Mr. John, who helped arrange a car to pick us up at the airport, complete with the girlsâ names on a sign. Mr. Gustavo drove us into the city and was a delightful source of information. When we arrived, we stored our bags for a small fee, and were free to roam about the city. We returned just before 4pm, and when I approached a gentleman to ask where to check in, Mr. Mohammed said have a seat over here and I will take care of you! I had requested a MetroView room with two;5
This stay was a last minute decision.  We wanted to stay in North Hollywood but the rates were really high.  We checked online and found LAX was more reasonable and centrally located.  The posted rate was competitive for the airport so I went in to the desk and the nice person at the desk gave me a senior discount that took about $20 off the regular rate.  Sold!  The hotel was business oriented which we enjoy and very clean and modern.  We went to the bar and had a burger and fries that was excellent.  The guys next to us had salmon which looked and smelled fantastic.  Our room was exceptional which overlooked the 25 R and L runway which was fun. Iâm an aviation enthusiast so it was right up my alley. By the way, the room was insulated very well so the jet blast was;5
When I booked this hotel, I was a little more than skeptical as it was cheaper than some of the hostels in the area ($129/night). But I figured, it was a name-brand hotel on the Upper West Side three blocks from Central Park, so what could I lose? And boy am I glad I did.  The hotel lobby is old, but clean and established looking. There are a myriad of ways to get ot your room including at least two banks of elevators and a stairwell. There front desk staff were prompt and very nice. I also had to work with them over the phone prior to arriving because I accidentally double booked and they were equally nice in this instance.  The elevators on the right are a little rickety, so I would suggest taking the bank to the left by the Bell desk. Once you get to your floor, you will;5
My wife and I stayed at the Riad Kheirredine during our recent holiday to Marrakech.  Beyond the beautiful decor, cozy rooms and calming nature of the Riad itself, the staff simply made our holiday in Morocco a fantastic experience.  It was hands down the best level of service we have ever experienced at a hotel.  From the moment you wake up in the morning, to the time you go to bed, the staff at Riad Kheirredine is there to provide you with whatever you need to make you feel 100% at home.  My wife and I left feeling that we were part of their family.;5
When you think about a place to stay, a subject to consider is defenetely the place. The empire is located practically in front of the Lincoln Center. There are wonderful places to eat and to visit nearby. If you enjoy shopping you will be satisfied with that too. A very unique museum is the MAD(Museum of Arts and Design) right at Columbus Circle. There are restaurants for all kinds of budgets, and, best of all, a Wholefoods Market also at Columbus Circle. You can start the day with a stroll in Central Park and finish with an Opera at the Lincoln Opera House . The hotel has an excelent service: from the front desk to the cleaners. The roof with its pool is a wonderful place to have  breakfast in a summer morning or a happy hour in the evening. It also has a bar and a fancy;5
Nice, clean hotel near Central Park and Fairway Market (33 cent water bottles, fresh fruit, muffins, breads and spreads, salads, meat, cheese, etc.). Kitchenette was very useful. Clean towels, sheets, extra pillows. Bathroom was a little tight, but it was ok. Comfortable in a room with a double bed and pullout sofa for 3 people. Subway station close by - very convenient. Good neighborhood - very safe for 3 young girls! Hotel staff was friendly. Only bad thing is that they charge $5 for each piece of luggage you want to store past checkout (this should be complimentary). Hotel lobby looked great - newly renovated! Overall, great experience!;5
A wonderful first experience of Morrocans Riads. The place is charming, with a great attention to details (nice deco & musc perfume, fruits everyhere, pleasant bathrooms with wonderful products,   very friendly and hepful staff). The pool was a must in a hot summer weather and the terrace perched over the medina absolutely wonderful to chill out on a safa. The trick with this place is that once you have reached it, you just do not want to leave !;5
When we arrived there the welcome was so brilliant. when we went up to our room it was so spacious and the bed was so comfortable. The facilites were so great. would definetely recommened it.;5
It was my very first visit to USA and was a bit overwhelmed arriving in New York. The staff at the check in desk were so friendly and explained everything. The room was small but I understand that is the same across Manhattan. It was clean and tidy so what more do I want? We didn't pay extra for a room with a view but we were on the 26th floor looking down 34th Street towards the Empire State Building. We could also see One World Trade and Chrysler Building. We were in walking distance of many major attractions.;5
We stayed here for four days and had such an amazing time, the beds are something else - have not slept that well in years!!   The staff are first class, every single member of their team greeted us smiling and happy, always wanting to help! Canât wait to stay again!;5
Hotel was great. Front desk was very pleasant and informative. The room was clean and very quiet.  I would definitely stay there again. Everything was centrally locates for my event.  We had family members stay as well. Great job !!!;5
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The complementary breakfast was yummy and had many options! They even had an omlet station and the cooks were very nice when they were making it. The rooms were very clean and updated.;5
We stayed for 5 nights and we have zero complaints. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. The rooms were wonderful. The breakfast was delicious (a waffle and an omelette bar? yes please!) Even the parking attendants were sweet. Very close to all the things we wanted to do. Very close to Griffith Park...Sunsets there are amazing! Overall, a wonderful experiences. Thanks Hollywood Hotel!;5
Great room - two bathrooms was a bonus Great service at the check in desk and by the security team at the elevators. Felt secure in hotel, location was superb right outside Penn St and subway was very easy to navigate.;5
If you wanna experience service like never before, this is the place to go! We felt so gently taken care of in every situation starting from the first e-mails regarding our booking. Beautiful surroundings, good food, excellent service.;5
I don't know where to start with how incredible this Riad is. From the minute the transport pick you up from the airport to the time they drop you back, you are thoroughly looked after & I've never experienced anything like it. Hotels have a lot to learn about hospitality from this place!  The Riad itself is breathtakingly beautiful, authentic Moroccan design, sophisticated, spotless. Our room was beautiful with walk in wardrobe, lovely bathroom, 4 poster bed & all toiletries & amenities (hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner), including fresh fruit everyday.  You can drink as much fresh mint tea with dry fruits on the side as you like all included & we did this every day. This also applies to the fresh fruit which was wonderful because we took an apple or pear with us everyday!  The;5
Great place to stay if you want to experience the real Marrakech. The staff is extremely helpful and accommodating and can tell you plenty about where to go and what to do. The breakfast at the roof terrace is the best way to start the day.;5
We got our flight canceled for 2 days because it was snowing in Philly.  Bed was nice,  beautiful furnishings and a view of the runway.  Food was great but expensive for me.  Had uber eats deliver to our room on the second night.  Definitely made for a nice detour;5
We had the pleasure of staying here for a few days during my families spring break.  Perfectly located to get anywhere you need to go and is a short walk to Central Park, subway stations, and 15 minute walk from the Broadway theaters.  It's also slightly removed from the busy sidewalks you find by the theaters and Times Square.  We stayed in a Junior Suite, which is a large room by NYC standards, which was perfect for my wife, daughter, and I.  They really had everything we needed there, with lots of restaurants close by, a Starbucks on the corner, and a great lobby bar.  We would certainly stay there again.;5
Stayed at this location because it was near a lot of restaurants and price was reasonable. Gustavo at the front desk is truly a gem. Every time we came back to the hotel Gustavo would greet us with a welcome back or a good night, truly great service he provided to me and my friend. We will definitely be back.;5
Never stayed up this end before, but itâs a great location, penn station, madison square garden, Macyâs, right on the doorstep!   The hotel is lovely! Lovely reception staff, great concierge , lobby staff, happy to help, friendly and knowledgeable.  We had our room cleaned every day, she was brilliant! Tho we did take the majority of our rubbish away with us! Love the recycling bin in the bedroom!   Would I stay here again? Absolutely!!  Hope to see you again very soon ðºð¸ð½ðâ¤ï¸;5
Great hotel...friendly, helpful staff, Tick -Tock dinner had good food reasonably priced and rooms were clean and well maintained, lobby great place to people watch...and would definitly use this hotel again;5
The New Yorker is a great place to stay! It is in an excellent location, extremely clean, beautiful, and has a wonderful staff. When we had to check-in early because our flight arrived early in the day, the lady at the front desk was able to get us one of the best rooms we could ask for so that we could get checked in and our vacation started. We can hardly wait to come back! Great value for Manhattan, Times Square.;5
I 've had a couple great stays at theis beuatifully renovated LAX Hyatt.  The staff hospitality is excellent and the amenties very nice.  Best feature is that the hotel is walking distance to the Southwest Terminal at LAX.  I will definitely return.;5
this was our first time to visit New York City, Stayed from 09/27/14 to  w10/14/14, Very professional upon arrival and the bellman were very prompt and attentative to our needs, the front desk staff was very polite and informative, The room was beautifully appointed but i was shocked at the size, husband is in the vacation industry and we stay in 3 bedroom condos as a norm , this room was 14x12 and the smallest bathroom! !!, sink was itty bitty, ! im not exageratin when i say you had to back into the bathroom to use it, it has a restaurant on the second level that was not over priced and quite delicious,starbucks wasnext door ans so was the drug store ,location was PERFECT!! in front of Lincoln Center ,! block from Central Park and minutes from TIME SQUARE. we walked it mant;5
My husband and I arrived on a Friday morning for a long weekend in Marrakesh. We were welcomed at the airport by a taxi driver arranged by the riad holding a sign with our family name who spoke both English and French.  The driver during our trip to the Riad offered suggestions for places to visit during our stay and when we arrived at end of the pedestrian street he introduced us to Isamel. We were led by foot to the riad by Isamel through the narrow streets while our luggage was brought by a small cart.  Upon arrival at the Riad we received a very warm welcome from Marina, Wafa, Valentina, and Hakim then we seated in the lovely dining room to enjoy mint tea, local crepes with honey and butter, fruits salad, and pastries. We arrived quite early so they stowed our luggage and;5
We really enjoyed our 3 nights staying in this hotel and were genuinely sad to leave. Location is excellent. We did not have a car, but found the area to be walkable, with Ubers easy to get if needed. The Metro is just down the hill, we could walk to In-N-Out Burger, Universal and CityWalk. Apparently there was also a free shuttle, though we never felt the need to use it. The pool and the pool area is a great place to relax and escape the mayhem of the theme park. Our room was excellent. Spacious with awesome views of Universal Studios and surrounding suburbs. Beautiful both during the day and at night. Only downside was room servicing. I would call it lazy. We keep the room tidy and only needed rubbish to be removed and essentials replenished. The rubbish was removed, but not;5
Very nice hotel and convenient to Hollywood, Beverly Hills and of course Universal Studios. They alert you of problems with the elevator but we had no issue. Liked the online check-in which allows you to make special requests so I had chocolate covered strawberries delivered at a specific time and they were delivered as promised which made me a hero to my wife. Clean and quiet although we were here during a slow time of the year.  Staff gets an A+ for friendliness.  Beds are amazing;5
From LAX airport shuttle bus pick up to check out every thing here was great.  Courteous friendly staff were helpful and nice.  the room was in perfect order.  The bar staff and food excellent.  Very convenient location to LAX terminals.  I would not hesitate to book this again for an overnight when traveling LAX.;5
Perfect location for going to see lion king! A little walk down to Waterloo bridge and over that and youâre there! Lots to see along the walk so went fast!  Hotel staff were helpful and friendly and lovely and clean. Would recommend if wanting central London, great value for money and breakfast was amazing! Highly recommend!;5
My fiance and I just returned the the states from a two week European vacation that included three days in Marrakech. I have known about Riad Kheirredine for almost two years and I've been waiting for the opportunity to see if it lives up to the reviews. Well, I can personally say it does. We stayed in the Canelle room and it was the perfect size for a couple. Each night's turn down service included filling our room with an aroma that came from an oil being heated by a candle. We loved it so much we had to bring some back home with us! All of the amenities are top notch: mint tea whenever you please, ample rooftop lounging, mobile phone, escorts to and from the medina, and attentive staff.   I don't want to sound like a broken record echoing everything that other reviewers said;5
It was good you have someone taking care of you when you check in. The room is so so  and a air conditioner making noises bet we get help with smile and a difrent room weich is good makes everything different;5
This is an amazing place to stay. Had superb service even before my arrival. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, from the hotel manager to the reservations ladies! A special word of thank you must be made of Gabina, who treated us like we were her own family! Thank you to the lovely people made our stay here memorable.;5
Wrote a review before & wanted to do it agian! This a wonderful hotel! The rooms are very spacious. Great food, beautiful outdoor pool and great location. Short walk to Universal Citywalk and Studios. Nice lobby, the little cafe is also very good.  I would go back! Very clean, maintained hotel. Recommended for sure!  *** View my profile to find my website link for more reviews! *** Any questions, ask!;5
If I we could rate Riad Kheirredine a 10 out of 5, we would. We stayed 4 nights in March, 4 adults and 4 kids. Everything was absolutely flawless. From the warm welcome with the best tea, to the mobile phones for everyone to stay in touch, to the beautiful building filled with art and design, curated carefully and designed for comfort and serenity. The free laundry service was a great relief after 4 days traveling around (they folded our clothes better than Iâve ever seen), and the fresh flowers in each room, breakfast where and when you want it (just call, 3 minutes later it appears), and the rooftop! That view. We love to eat out and try new things but we ended up eating all 4 of our dinners at the Riad because the food is DELICIOUS (tagines, and pizza a d pasta if you are;5
Arrived late evening at the Wyndham and check in staff were very polite. Smooth process and straight up to the 22nd floor to our room. More than acceptable room for our trip...decent beds, clean, nice bathroom...lovely art-deco lobbies and fixtures...gives you a very romantic feel to the stay. During our stay there were problems at times with the lifts but the staff were very helpful and directed us to the service elevators as an alternative. The view from our room, 2237, was limited but let's be honest, when you go to Manhattan, how much time do you WANT to spend in your room admiring a view when you should be out there experiencing it?!  Location......couldn't be better as a base for Manhattan. Directly opposite Penn Station and within easy walking distance of all of midtown;5
The only problem i've had with this hotel was it's location on the Jane street. I arrived to Manhattan to the nearest proximity of where i thought the hotel was located (meat apcking district, lots of posh clubs there, seems to be very safe place even late at night) but even the local police didn't know about the jane st. At last somebody gave me the right directions and i found this awsome hotel. 99$ per single room (a little more for a double one, which should make it totally affordable). Very clean, very comfy despite the tiny room size (like a small cabin on a ship).  iPod docking station, phone, tv, huge mirror, fan, free bottle of pure water.  Manually operated funny elevator. Nice bar on the ground level during the nights. Friendly and helpful staff (which is rare).;5
The hotel shuttle made our stay extremely convenient to the airport, which was our top priority.  The hotel was gorgeous, very modern with nice rooms.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The only negative for our stay was our 2 queen room had a sliding door to the bathroom that doesn't lock.;5
My husband and I wanted to take a mini vacation to Universal Studios so we booked with Hilton Universal City.  We were not disappointed!  Universal Studios is right across the street.  Check-in was quick and easy.  We politely asked if a room upgrade was available and that this was our first stay with Hilton.  Kas, the front desk consier, upgraded our room to a king suite on the 16th floor with a view overlooking Universal Studios.  Our room was clean, comfortable and spacious.  Whenever we walked through the lobby, a staff member would stop and ask us if we needed anything, and if our stay so far was good.  Love the Hilton!  We will be coming back!;5
The service was fantastic. It has everything you could ask for. Very well thought out. Staff were so helpful and friendly. We went as a group of girls. Made us feel really safe. Would definitely go back.;5
WOW yet again another fantastic visit to The New Yorker Hotel.   This time our stay took us up to the lead up to Christmas.   Yes the city is very busy at this time of year however its worth paying a little more at this time of the year to get to see all the Christmas lights and the fab Rockefeller Christmas tree.  Like I said this was our 4th visit on the trot and I cant thank all the staff enough at the hotel for everything they do.  Big thanks to Suzie in the hotel concierge, yet again she has helped us get out of a number of problems with our mobility scooter, room offering her expert knowledge of the city to offer us a great stay.  Big shout out to the manager on duty during our stay Dell. Thank you for what you did for us. You will remember us and what you did for me and;5
My husband booked Riad Kheirredine as a romantic surprise for our weekend trip to Marrakech. All prior correspondence with Yajaira and Valentina was fast and extremely helpful. On arrival, we were welcomed with a beautiful smile and a very calm explanation of the craziness of Marrakech. We stayed in the gorgeous Rose room - with ambient rose scents burning and a delightful rose petal love heart on the bed :-) We ate a delicious traditional Moroccan meal with complimentary drinks throughout. The small team of staff made our stay even more perfect - all have beautiful manners and smiles. Nothing is any trouble. It was a great pleasure to stay at Riad Kherredine.  I highly recommend staying here. Fab Fab Fab (and very clean!!)!!!!! Thank you for our magical memories!;5
I've been to NYC a few times now and I still return to the New Yorker as my Hotel of choice.  At it's price point it gives everything you might need for a comfortable holiday.  Whilst the first room we were allocated was a tad small for more than a week stay, I asked to be moved to a larger room and there was no fuss or issue at all.    For me, a significant plus point of this Hotel is its location.  Many people worry about transport and directions, and in my opinion can get 'guided' unnecessarily into using taxi's when really there is no need.  They will often be slower and certainly more expensive than trains or subway.  Arriving from Newark Airport by train was really simple (as was the return),  and the daily use of the Subway system is all part of the New York experience.;5
"The Riad is a lovely converted house in the middle of the Medina.  It has all the comforts of home as well as a ""magic"" number.  Just dial 200 and all that you wish for will come true.  We found that out the first morning we ordered breakfast.  You can have your breakfast anywhere you wish in the Riad.  In our case Ibrahim would appear about 15 minutes after dialing the magic number.  Elena(a charming lady from the Philippines) made sure we were well looked after including booking a walking tour of the Medina, a trip to the amazing waterfalls and a day trip to Essouira(make sure to look for goats in trees).  If you can ask for Mohammed as you guide and Abdul as your driver and you will be guaranteed a wonderful tour with tons of information and good humour.  The food here is";5
The Riad view is amazing and hotel is very luxurious and the rooms very nice. Food is tasty but the best thing is the staff who are very helpful and friendly. Breakfast is delicious which is included. Whoâs recommend. They also give you a mobile phone to take away during stay so you can contact them anytime and use for mapping and planning while out. Truly great Riad;5
WWE. at the met stadium  .very easy to get to ..and what a venue ..we stayed in the new Yorker ..fab hotel...great value .with great views ..would book the hotel again ..  clean and the beds were like sleepin on a cloud   ..photos are night and day time views from our room ..;5
I stayed at this hotel with my fiance just before New Year's because of an accepted bid on Priceline and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The rooms are a little small, particularly the bathroom. However, the staff fulfilled all of our requests. The furnishings in the rooms are very nice and are at least 4 star quality. The bed is comfortable and the room had a nice TV as well as a fully stocked mini fridge. The shower was one of the best hotel showers I've experienced and I loved the towels. The air conditioner wasn't so great, but we could open the windows all the way. The hotel is in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Manhattan and is convenient to so many things. The lobby turns into a lounge at night, which isn't so pleasant to return to, but it did not disturb our;5
"Stay-30th May2012- 2nd June, 2012. I was overall happy with our stay. Delicious breakfast, v good rooms, friedly staff, good loctation, there are two metro stations near this hotel, so transportation was not a problem. I will happily recommend this to everyone, but dont make a mistake to book the rental car named "" Advance rental car"" available at this hotel, we had a very bad experience with them, they gave us an old car with all four bald tires and two of them burst after only 35 miles and they refuse to help us out in the middle of no way. Hopeless company";5
Was so impressed with everyone from the doorman, bellhops, front desk, bartender in lobby bar, rooftop bar and wait staff and your hotel manager Michael!  What an impressive and very efficient staff Empire Hotel has!;5
Hotel was very nice!  Lobby and restaurant were beautiful.  Our room was spacious and the beds were very comfortable.  Went to an event at the Hollywood Bowl and the concierge helped us find transportation so we would not have to drive and park there.  Sometimes Hilton hotels are not the greatest but I would definitely recommend this location.;5
This was my second visit to the Empire. Itâs a great location near Central Park and easy walking distance for shopping and sightseeing. Great roof top bar with indoor and outdoor seating. Rooms were clean with comfy beds and pillows. All the staff are helpful and check in and check out done quickly and efficiently.;5
This hotel was a pleasure to stay in, great hot complementary breakfast, large room, clean and the best thing was the location close to the Metro and Buses to Santa Monica etc. Quiet and safe location, nice garden area to sit in with a lovely fountain.;5
The location was fantastic, right next to the Ed Sullivan Theater in the heart of the theater district. We walked to the theater every night. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. And the beds were super-comfortable. i would definitely stay there again!;5
Whatever you do, stay at this hotel!! The service is unbelievable! We are beyond thrilled with our experience. Roberto at the pool bar was so sweet and makes delicious drinks! Thank you thank you to everyone who made our trip amazing.;5
This hotel stands out above the rest!!! I am so impressed with the customer service here! You will not be disappointed! The staff here truly cares! The Hilton Honors reception is spectacular! From the valet to the hostess to the servers... beyond excellent! I highly recommend!;5
We met Mr Francisco Giron when we had dinner at Cafe Sierra..When we had dinner he was very accommodating and friendly....  He checked on us many times to make sure we were having a good time and that the food was prepared right....he always had kind words and always had a smile on his face. Thanks again, Rod and Elsa;5
We had been given a present for afternoon tea for 2 at the ritz and decided to make it a two night stay in London. We only live 8 miles away but I felt like I was on holiday in another city as I have never done the London sightseeing before.  The hotel is literally a 2 minute walk to the London eye, we travelled up by train to Waterloo station and it's about a 5 or 6 minute walk from there. The staff who greeted us were very friendly and professional and we booked the dinner/breakfast deal for one night and morning. We went to our room on the 6th floor (premier plus room) and we were delighted how fresh and modern it felt, a really lovely bathroom with shower only, coffee machine, fridge, ironing board/iron and the view was looking directly at the London eye. The only criticism;5
8th time staying at this Amazing hotel. Great welcome on arrival, Stayed in room 1901 which was clean and spacious for 4 ladies with 2 bathrooms which went down a treat. Really can not fault this hotel and will be rebooking for the same week next year. Tick Tock Diner was fab each morning for breakfast.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker as we were attending the Andrea Bocelli concert at msg which is right across the street. The check in lines were long but were moving steadily. In order to speed up the process  Reachell offered to check us in at the guest relations desk. After presenting my drivers license she noticed that it was my birthday and said she would be sending something up to the room. She also accommodated us with our room choice and was so pleasant and helpful. Shortly after we settled in guest service delivered to us a bottle of wine and two glasses with a   birthday message from the New Yorker and a handwritten birthday wish from Reachell. It is always nice to see people in customer service that truly enjoy their job are great doing it. Thank you for a memorable;5
The New Yorker is the best ! Located in the center of everything, complete with comfortable beds and great high-pressure shower in Art Deco bathtubs (love my baths)â¦  and the views are spectacular. There is a 24-hour NYC diner attached to the property called TICK TOCK which is great! There is an Italian restaurant also attached -also very good.. and in the basement below the TICK TOCK?: a kicka$$ steak restaurant called the BUTCHER AND THE BANKER, which is fan-tastic !!! It is located in the marble and wrought iron gorgeousness of a former 1930âs BANK. People are literally eating in a beautiful VAULT! A vault the likes of which Al Capone and Rockefeller could have hid massive slabs of gold. That thing is huge!  The flagship MACYâS is so close-by, tooâ loved thatâ They have a;5
We spent three days at the Wyndham New Yorker and found it very clean and convenient for transport. It's within a block of Penn Station and the Amtrak, and even you have two different metro stations with 6 different lines within two blocks. It also has a number of decent restaurants nearby and is in easy walking distance to the empire state building.   The room was clean and comfortable and you had to show your key card to staff to access the elevators, which is a nice security feature for women traveling alone.  They hold you bag for free the day you check in if you check in early and the room is not ready, or you can store your bag with them for $2.00 a bag the day you check out.;5
It is hard to know where to start.... this hotel is incredible in every way.  Stunningly beautiful property, incredible food, amazing location.  But honestly - it is the service that was the most spectacular part: we experienced without question the best service I have ever had in many many years of traveling all over the world.  Every single person working at the Riad Kheirredine was amazing - kind, warm, caring and constantly went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect. I could go on and on.  STAY HERE! It will not disappoint.;5
Hello Trip advisor and HYATT REGENCY LAX   My name is Donald P. . I am a regional Director for Verizon Wireless.  I want to tell you that my flight was delayed I missed four meetings that were really important and all DELTA  could tell me was sorry not till tomorrow and I have to pay for my own room so , I go to the LAX Hyatt Regency where I was greeted by a beautiful young lady name Myra and she was absolutely fantastic check in the end she made sure everything I needed was taken care of not only that but the manager that was on duty I believe his name is Alejandro I was so amazed about how busy it got in there he took charge of the entire situation. There was a line going from the front desk all the way out to the front door and it was only him  and Myra every person that;5
This is a hotel that provides the bare bone amenities however, the service and facilities are of high quality. The staff which include the front desk, the bell boys, the security agents, and the Restaurant staff were all professional, helpful and friendly! When you come to New York and you are trying to see a lot in two days, you do not need a hotel room with TV etc. Though there is Wi Fi service at the hotel. I enjoyed the white house coat, and sleepers they provide for going to the shared bathrooms. The bed was the size of an army cot, and mattress quite hard, but you can ask for additional pillows, blanket, and in my case even a chair so I could sit and put my shoes on. It is not the ideal for a person with reduced mobility, or Queen Size... but I did sleep! Found the;5
I found the room clean, well furnished and quite nice.  As a historic property, the room was slightly smaller than what may be expected in a more modern facility, but had been nicely refurbished.  The proximity to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and Herald Square made this a nice midtown choice for my stay.  I would certainly stay here again.;5
We just spent 7 days in NYC for an event at MetLife Stadium in NJ.  I have to be honest we travel to NYC many times before and and at the last min changed plans to from NJ to the city.  I was on line checking rates and was put off by some emails back and forth from the customer service group.  Then I decided to call and see if I got better service. Lucky for us we got Ms Gunita Suri (Front Office Supervisor)  who was amazing in helping us with our challenges with the Empire reservation system.  She secured us a room, and great rate and kept in contact with us prior to coming.  We got there in Friday evening and love the area the Empire is located at!  Walk to Central Park a block away, subway stop at 66th and Broadway or south at 1 Columbus, Lincoln Center is across the street!;5
Great hotel, very good location - about 7 minutes walking from Times Square, and about The same time walking to Central Park.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  The staff is great - very nice and helpful, Especially Elena and Jeff!   Thank you!!;5
Enjoyed our entire stay! Good value and great service in the hotel. Every employee we chatted with was delightful and the rooftop bar is a must! Good drinks and a beautiful view from the deck outdoor! Nice amenities and very helpful every time we contacted the front desk for something we needed!;5
I needed help and comfort as a result of the Getty Fire and Pil and Brian made everything so easy and welcoming. The location is convenient for great food and nightlife, as well as my favorite book store!  Thank you!! I'll definitely be back!;5
Although my boyfriend and I live in Brooklyn, we sometimes stay at a hotel in Manhattan just to avoid the long train rides back home after a night out partying with friends. Over the weekend (6/6) I saw there's a promotion for Empire Hotel, and decided to stay here. I'm also a die hard fan of Gossip Girl, so I was very eager to check out the place where the show shot so many episodes. We checked in around 5pm, and our concierge, Rudy, generously upgraded us to a suite room, with fabulous view! He also threw in a free Wifi pass. The suite we got (419) was very spacious, with a dinning table, sofa, lounge chair, and bedroom that can close with a door. The decor looked very similar to the one in the show. The bed was super comfy--we have never slept so well! Yes the downside is the;5
I booked a room at the Jane and found their website and booking process both efficient and easy to manage.  I unfortunately had to cancel the booking, but the cancellation was just as easy and efficient plus great customer service without penalties or excess fees.;5
Room was quiet, furniture had a stain that needs attention. Someone was smoking in their room and hallway smelled like Marijuana. Ice machine did not work on first night but was fixed. Overall experience was good.;5
Absolute perfect stay. Not a single thing I can fault.   Great location, hotel is very clean and stunning lobby.   Can be a bit lively at night round the hotel but no noise when in the room.   A hotel full of charm and character. Just what you want as a tourist.   Thank you to all the staff and we will see you again hopefully.;5
We had a great experience at this hotel. The staff was all very helpful and friendly. We received especially great service from Rosendo at the breakfast buffet. He was very attentive and everybody was well taken care of. Thank you so much!;5
Loved staying here after our flight from the UK en route home. Attentive staff and very professional outfit.Quiet - double glazing windows. 5 minutes from airport about half a mile away. Loved the small cafe style so our son could enjoy his favorite pastries that were divine unlike most other places that have them laced with sugar. Up there with French pastries! 100% thumbs up and we shall return from Australia;5
"Hugo and Sonia ""the chefs"" We're absolutely delightful people, so polite with very happy demeanors. They prepared a delicious breakfast every morning and made the start to my very very pleasant. I recommend to anyone not to miss breakfast!!";5
Loved my stay here! Easy check-in.Staff is very attentive and friendly, Room was very clean, and the bed so comfortable! We really enjoyed the roof-top lounge. Great location! Will absolutely stay here on our next trip.;5
Our stay so far in the Hollywood Hotel has been absolutely amazing! Beautiful rooms, nice pool, gorgeous courtyard. The best thing about it is how friendly and helpful the staff are! While staying we encountered Mikey S, Anna Marie, Michael G and Cynthia. The most helpful and beautiful people! Cant wait to come back to the hotel!;5
As a diamond member we rarely go outside of the Hilton Brand but since we stayed at Hilton on our first layover we decided to try this one. Both close to airport and convenient for a 5:00 am flight.  I actually loved this hotel. The way it was decorated was so nicely done. It really reminded me of a Manhattan hotel. The room and hotel actually looked new. I didn't do the research so I'm not sure if this was a remodel or not but it is in great condition.   Ate dinner and had dessert downstairs. Waiter was knowledgeable about menu. Had a great mixed drinks menu and atmosphere altogether was nice. Would definitely book this one again. Free airport shuttle service also.;5
I picked this hotel purely on location.. she is a grand old girl.. travelling with a party of 5 we grabbed a suite for the week.. we were a little disappointed only 1 bathroom but we managed.. the beds after travelling from Australia to New York were heaven in our 5 weeks stay in the States we often talked about those beds... location wise shopping everywhere just across the road is Madison square gardens buy the tickets for ice hockey you won't be disappointed.. time square & broadway a few blocks away. Tick tock restaurant adjoining the New Yorker is value for money meals especially for a big party..;5
I really enjoyed by stay here the hotel was cool and small and had great character and charm. The room was quite small but pretty standard size for NYC. It has a roof terrace with a pool.   It is very near Columbus circle and central park. We were able to walk to Time Square with no problems. It is located near some fantastic restaurants and there's a starbucks right on the corner because you are in New York and you cannot walk anywhere without your Starbucks in your hand.  We really liked it here we would come back.;5
We booked the hollywood hotel when we seen a last minute deal and our pre booked hotel did not look great.  We pulled up and were immediately pleasantly surprised the entrance was nice not too grand but made us feel special.  We were in close proximity to the hollywood sign, hollywood boulevard, and all other touristy things to do in LA.  Rooms were lovely obviously very well kept and cleaned.  The pool was nice very 50's hollywood felt like an old movie star.  The terrace was lovely but was not open while we were there as it was a bit out of season.;5
Come here 4 times a year and always enjoy my stay. Pasquale at the front desk is the best, always helpful and makes sure everything is perfect. The hotel is situated in a strategic position close to Central Park and shopping. Staff at the bar are awesome as well.;5
5 stars Riad. It's a very beautiful place, best location in the Medina town. The staff is very helpful and caring and they made you feel as home. You will feel very secure as they will follow you everywhere if you wish or pick you upp if you come loss. Book your stay true dem directly as you will get more facilities free of charge;5
"We have just come back from a 5 night stay in the Riad Kheirredine. The Riad arranged a car to collect us from the airport, which took roughly 15 minutes and ended up a small square close to the Riad (  Ben Sli Man  )  were we jumped out & were greeted by 2 members of staff who quickly organised our luggage and whisked us by foot into the Medina to find the Riad.  And what a delight it was to open the door into the lobby of the Riad, the smell was really inviting, the in door garden was such a wonderful sight,very quickly we were welcomed & given a real mint tea, which we enjoyed by the pool. The check in was very relaxed and we were very quickly made to feel at home, before we explored the rest of the Riad.  We arrived in our room "" Aurora"" which was on the top floor over";5
We stayed at Hilton Universal City for 2 nights / 3 days (I wish I could stay at least a week!).  I chose this Hotel after reading some tripadvisor's reviews, and did it specially because it's right next to Universal Studios. There is  a free shuttle which can take you there and bring you back.   The front desk people are very kind and all the employees, as well. The check-in was quick and perfect, despite it's on 3 PM, our room was already prepared when we arrived there (before Noon), what was perfect after our long flight of 12 hours (from Brazil to LA).  The room was very comfortable, the bed, sheets and pillows extremelly clean and soft, we felt like being at home. Great view from the room.  Restaurant: excelent!  I strongly recommend this Hotel, and can't wait to go back.;5
great hotel with a great location within walking distance of the best attractions. very large room with a fantastic bed and shower, great staff always kind and friendly! a special thanks to Jeffry who with his advice helped us in the big apple ...;5
Great location easy to get taxi/Uber to go sightseeing.  The room was good size, bed very comfortable and the restaurant was good for dinner and breakfast.  Pool was also good.  The room had everything that was needed.;5
My sister and I stayed 3 nights at Riad Kheirredine and had the most incredible experience! The staff genuinely made us feel at home and seemed to provide our every need before we even asked for it. They went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible without hovering around all the time.   The staff walked us to and from our taxi's and transfer vehicles so we never had to be left alone in the medina (we were a bit concerned about being hassled as young blondes), they provided a mobile phone so that we could contact them at any time, they arranged for a guide to walk us around Marrakech (who I cannot recommend highly enough!!) and made all our reservations at restaurants and La Mammounia on our behalf. The daily free laundry service was a god-send when my face;5
The Hilton is our home away from home very friendly staff very clean rooms the park is walking distance a big plus!!!!! The Sunday prime rib buffet is worth it after a long day at the Park!!!! If you forget anything the concierge will take care of you!!!!;5
Great service some of the best I have received anywhere. Attentive staff, who went out of their way to help. Small touches like giving you a local mobile in case you get lost was fantastic. All the staff very knowledgeable and happy to share! Would not hesitate to  recommending To all my friends & Family! The staff made our stay even more delightful. Thank you so much.;5
We travelled here as a family in March 2013 to celebrate a 50th birthday. It was our first trip to New York and the hotel was perfect for what we needed.  The location is brilliant. Just up the road from Macys and The Empire State Building, and not far from Times Square and all the other main attractions.  We booked a standard room, but upgraded to a suite with views of The Empire State Building on arrival. The room was absolutely stunning, and very spacious for the three of us. I have heard that the standard rooms can be very small, so if you like your space, I would defo recommend upgrading to a suite.  We ate breakfast at the Tick Tock diner a few times and always had a good meal. Its convenient as its located at the hotel.  I would defo recommend this hotel to anyone;5
This hotel is a big hotel but treats its many clients as if its a small establishment, very friendly. The location for us was great. If you are on a budget or need a coffee or a bite to eat a McDonalds is right opposite. Just round the corner from Penn Station, which was wonderful for connecting with metro or trains etc.;5
Hotel was great!  Everything clean, but a real bonus was the two restaurants, an Italian one for dinner and the Tick-Tock for breakfast.  Just great. Location couldn't be topped.;5
We had a pleasant stay at this hotel. Ask for Franchesca when you're there. I don't think she could be unfriendly even if she tried. Other staff was kind too. Make your reservation thru a travel agency, it proved to be much cheaper.;5
- Stayed here for 3 nights and was perfect for what we wanted.  - King bed extremely comfortable.  - Room very spacious. - Great location near Universal Studios. - Not far from Hollywood. - All staff very helpful. - Parking expensive but I guess it's about the normal.;5
I was so surprised at how georgeous and spacious the room was. I was vacationing with my fifteen year old son and the best thing was we could get to all kinds of tourist places and AVOID the traffic.  The place was very clean and the continental breakfast included belgian waffles cereal eggs and sausage and bagels and pastry.  This place was a gem for the price and we stayed for four nights.  I have to say that I am also impressed with the staff. On the second night we went out to hollywood and i had taken my wedding ring off for lotion when we got home. the next morning we were in a rush to get to disneyland and i forgot one of my rings and could not even remember where i had put it. when we got back that evening the ring was spotless and my ring was set on top of a memo paper.;5
The Wyndham New Yorker is my go to hotel when visiting NYC.  Love the location,being near Penn Station, walking distance to Broadway Shows, but not in Times Square.  Catching the subway is right there, since I visit son in Brooklyn often.  All staff are very friendly and accommodating.;5
Came in for our stay one day to early, but luckily we came across Pil at the front desk and easily helped us book a room and kept us there throughout our stay. Traveling with kids is not an easy task but Pil handled us like a pro. We loved the city view room, breakfast was delicious ( do not miss it ). Overall we had a great experience, we highly recommended.;5
Traveled here in Sept 08 wanted to explore LA and see the sights is located oposite Universal Studios Hollywood 5 min walk you will be at the entrance or hop on the free courtasy bus and hope on a trolly down the hill to the subway station where its 4 stops to Hollywood and Highland to see the sights the room was masive the lobby area was comfortable and lovly and has a great little shop and the pool area is just what you need after a busy day seeing the sights or going on the rides;5
I downloaded and made an account on TripAdvisor just to leave this review. The concierge, Majid, is a world class gentlemen and a true professional at his job. He was extremely accommodating and respectful from beginning to end. He truly made me felt like I was staying at a 5 star hotel. I had a tiny minor issue beyond his control and he went above and beyond to fix it immediately. Other than that, the hotel is clean and the room was nice. Ambiance is cool and location is 10/10. I will be returning AMAZING.;5
The breakfast here was nourishing, fantastic, and delicious.  Sonia was very attentive to my needs.  Staff is excellent and very professional as well.  Hotel is an excellent value compared to what we expected for this price.;5
Amazing service, always there to refill beverages and great knowledge of the hotel and things to do in the area. Amazing service everyone at the hotel thank you all making are stay a memorable one we love it.;5
This is a no nonsense hotel that knows how to look after its guests.  Everything is clean,efficient and works.  I expect a good bed, clean towels, sheets and carpet, this hotel always delivers.  They have state of the art Keurig Coffee machines and a clock.  Seems like every room has a good and unique view.  This time, I saw the river in the distance.  The staff are nice.  Most important, the rooms are quiet in busy NYC.  The plumbing works and the security seem to know who belongs in the hotel.  I been staying here for the last 20 years and will continue because of good value, quality and service.;5
We stayed here for one night following a flight into LAX. Was very pleased with the hotel. Recent room renovations are nice. It's quiet and the room AC works well, which are two things I always look for in hotels. Also really appreciated the free cold water in the lobby. It's a simple thing to do, and really nice touch when hotels have that. Hotel treats Hyatt elites well.   Note that nightly parking is really expensive at $55 per night, and is the reason that we chose not to rent a car. A less expensive self-parking option partnered with one of the nearby parking lots would be nice.  Thank you Hyatt Regency team!;5
LOVE the location - right across from Lincoln Center!  Well appointed room and very friendly, helpful staff. This is our go-to hotel for our yearly New York City adventure. The rooftop lounge has an amazing view!  Weâll be back....;5
The location, the staff, the food, the feeling was fantastic! My room was small because they were completely booked up - it was fashion week - however, it was just fine. They cleaned my room whenever I asked for it and room service was always fast. The front desk staff were great! I would definitely go back.;5
Really lovely property.   We had two connecting rooms for our family.    Marvelous view of universal.  AC was great.  Rooms in very good condition.   Housekeeping was good.   Clean - super clean.   Beds were some of the best Iâve ever slept in at a hotel.   Very quiet too.   I donât usually sleep this well on vacation.  Elevators were quick and plenty of capacity.   The breakfast buffet is good but a little expensive.  Close to universal and city walk.  Downside:  frequent pool and walkway closures for events.   The pool and walkway were closed our first night and this means people have to walk in the road.  The second night the pool was open but the walkway was closed again.  The 4th day the pool was closed again!   We feel that the pool and facility is what guests pay for and;5
if the hospital is your reason to be in Hollywood then the Hollywood is your home away from home. The hotel is very safe and pil is always on the alert. We felt at home with the nice beds and great people. Highly recommend;5
My 15 year old son and I had a wonderful time at Riad Kheirredine.  From the moment you enter the smell of vanilla soothes you, we were lucky to call this home for five nights.  The staff are excellent at taking care of their guests, always asking if you need anything and in most cases anticipating it and providing for you.  We were provided with a telephone which was a life saver when lost, we simply jumped in a cab and gave the phone to the driver to get instructions, and a riad staff was always ready to walk us to and from the medina.  I also had a royal spa experience, loved it!  The details like fresh white roses in the fountain are not unnoticed.  Will hopefully return soon<3;5
Very nice staff,exelent location,goood bed.I will come back soon,thank you very muchðI really enjoyed my stay here.It is so easy to get around,very central.Very nice places to eat in the neighbourhood.The door personal were always very helpful whith all my request,and always with a smile.;5
We stayed here for 2 nights, great location and really comfy beds! Hotel staff were really friendly & helpful especially yassir on reception and Jeff on the door. Would highly recommend this hotel for tourists who want to be near Times Square etc and just want a pleasant room to sleep in at the end of a busy day! We will be back ð;5
At the last minute we needed a good and inexpensive hotel to stay at. We were traveling with one 11 years old girl. The hotel was well situated across from the Lincoln Center, it was clean, the staff was friendly and we got an upgrade to a suite for the same price. We loved staying there and highly recommend it!!! we will stay there again and again when we return to NYC! The Rodriguez Weill Family;5
We spent seven nights in this luxurious and relaxing Riad in the heart of the Medina and can only praise everything about our wonderful stay. It is a beautiful oasis of calm and tranquility in the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. Decor is very tasteful and there are amazing views from the terraces.  Other reviews have already praised the helpful and attentive staff and also the use of a mobile phone to be used day or night. Staff go the extra mile without being obtrusive. They give excellent advice about restaurants, places of interest and trips, nothing is too much trouble. When we wanted to go on the bus to Essaouria, they not only booked the tickets for us but they even went to the bus station to pick them up. The food is superb, we had two evening meals there - one Moroccan;5
So I am a diamond member with Hilton and have stayed at tons of Hiltonâs. But I have created a home at the Hilton universal because of Tori Parker the manager. She creates a memorable experience every time I stay which is weekly. The beds are extremely comfortable, the rooms feel luxury, and the staff makes you feel like family! Great job Hilton staff as out of all the Hiltonâs in Southern California you are our preferred place to stay. And trust me that means a lot as I stay in Hiltonâs 3-4 days a week!!;5
Booked for 3 nights directly with Pil and made us part of his VIP list. He was a pleasure to meet. Very kind man. The hotel gives a lot for the price of the rooms. Breakfast and WiFi are free which is helpful for travelers. Highly satisfied.;5
The Days Inn Hotel New York City - Broadway was very clean, staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The location was right near a sub-way entrance and easy to get to Times Square.  While the 2 elevators were.small, I had no problem since I was on the 12th floor and the first one on, however the lower levels would have to wait for one that had room.  I was totally satisfied with my experience.;5
Riad Kheirredine is definitely a magical hoteI....I was a bit weary as I walked in the streets of the old Medina to get to the Riad..... But then as the doors opened and there it was...a white Moroccan jewel carved walls of white and in the center of the Riad is an atrium of greenery andTall plants soaring up to the top of the hotel ... Marianne is the owner from Italy and designed the hotel with the touch of an Italian Moroccan villa..... Greeted by the girls at reception invites you in as if you were in your own home..... The restaurant with the fireplace has incredible food and the service with all the staff is as good as a five star hotel....the energy is so warm and inviting that I will be back again  Thank you for such an incredible stay!!!!;5
Recently stayed here June 30 thru July 3, 2017.  Room on the 36th Floor a view of Madison Square Garden &  Empire State. Tick Tock Res is good. Shuttle to the hotel runs $23-$28. I recommend this hotel.;5
This is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Marrakech!  It is a huge contrast in itself as you walk from the rather untidy streets (which have their own identity) into the peace and quiet of this excellent Riad. Is is surpassed though by one thing only, that is the staff that run it! The service is the best I have experienced with incredible attention to detail. The staff will walk you to restaurants to ensure you do not get lost and enjoy your time. The cleaning team are amazing, this place must be cleaned constantly to maintain the standards we experienced. The reception team are attentive, very efficient and friendly and seem to read your mind !  All in all a superb Raid, stylish, relaxing, better than the great photos on line and highly recommended. You will love it!;5
Short stay just the one night before road trip , very pleasant hotel and all the staff very helpful chef Hugo very happy to help at breakfast and cooked lovely pancakes well worth the stay just for the breakfast;5
Stayed here for 7 nights. Spacious lobby with high end modern decor.   Good food and great vibes.   Nice place to hang out and have a drink.  Convenient location to get to LAX airport,  Midway car rental, restaurants and shops.  Easy to get to downtown and places of interest.  Our room was spacious and clean.  Very quiet  even if we are so close to the airport and highway.  Beds are so comfy.  Bathroom has all the amenities needed.  Towels plentiful.  Pool clean an heated.  No complaints.   Staff very pleasant and accommodating.  Highly recommend this hotel ðð.  Thanks Hyatt for a great stay.;5
We stayed for 4 nights while on a California holiday.  From arrival to departure the service from the staff was first rate. Friendly, helpful and a credit to the hotel.  We arrived to a nice welcome from the valet team. Our cases unloaded and they arrived in the room following a very quick check-in process.  We had a lovely room with a good view of the pool. The room was a good size with plenty of storage.  Easy access to Universal Citywalk either via a 10 minute walk or via the complimentary shuttle.  It is a good base for a visit to LA. We used Uber's from the hotel a number of times and these were quick, easy and quite economical.   Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.;5
"To begin, there are other hotels that are cheaper with better sized rooms in different parts of the city.  So why would you ever want to stay here?  Honestly, because the New Yorker encapsulates Manhattan. Many would say it IS Manhattan. Do you know Nikola Tesla lived here? On the other side of the street you have Madison Square Garden. At the base of the hotel, you have the Tick Tock diner. NYC food is known for two nostalgic things; Diners, and Pizza. Are you a goth group wanting to sit around and drink coffee at 3 in the morning? Head here! Are you a Millenial wall street exec hired to do a crappy job updating trade systems and need somewhere to grab a bite after a grueling 12 hr shift? Eat here! Are you an artist looking to draw their next epic? Yep, you guessed it!  Travel";5
Duke was a great manager!  !He was very helpful and always willing to improve. The room was very comfortable. The hotel was in an excellent location. Cleaning does need improvement in the rooms though.;5
"Spent 6 nights in this hotel and recommend it very highly for its convenience to the attractions New York has to offer. Central Park is in easy walking distance. The subway is close-by - and on a straight line that takes you Downtown - and thus most of the main ""must dos"" such as Statue of Liberty, World Trade Centre/Observatory/Observatory.   A bit further away - but an easy walk - is down to the High Line and Hudson River Park (Intrepid Museum and a lovely walk along the river for its own sake). Get a 7 day Metro Card - great value at $33 dollars each and saved us a lot of money! Avoid cabs (expensive). Although addressed as Times Square - thankfully the hotel wasn't right in amongst the Times Square bright lights and mayhem (having been there I would not recommend a hotel";5
My husband and I stayed here to attend a Broadway show in May 2017. We found the hotel through a last minute booking app, and we were extremely satisfied! I had read the rooms were small, but we had a double room which was very spacious. Everything was clean and well attended to. The staff were all excellent- very helpful doormen who were great with directions, the front desk staff was friendly and held our bags for us after we checked out, and the bartender was very knowledgable. Plus, the drinks were great! You must try the french martini. We had a very comfortable night's sleep. The only downside was all the traffic noise outside, but they do their best by providing complimentary earplugs...not much you can do when you are right downtown! Great trip, great stay, and we were;5
Had a wonderful experience.  Maria @ the front desk couldn't have been more helpful!   Great location with three on-site restaurants.  Really enjoyed the diner (Tik-Tok ).  Was surprised to find out that the restaurant is open 24 hrs and serves drinks to 3 a.m.  Anyways, highly recommended historic hotel.;5
This was the perfect hotel and location in NYC ! Highly suggest this hotel. Nick at the front desk is charming and quite accommodating. It was truly a treat to stay here. Super clean and great staff. You won't be disappointed!!!;5
Ask for Jeff for excellent service! The location is very good for easy walking access to Times Square. I traveled with a group of friends from Church, about 30 people, and have not heard any complaints about our Hotel from anyone.;5
Spacious modern hotel 5 minutes from airport with continuous shuttle service . The best hotel we have stayed at in the Los Angeles airport precinct . We drove our hire car to the hotel , checked in , then dropped the car off at budget car rental and walked one block back to hotel .  Super clean room with very comfortable bed . Airline crews also stay here .  Awesome place;5
Greatest size room especially for London!!!  It was warm and cozy for winter. Gorjuss comfortable bed and pillows and fairly quiet. Have stayed before and would recommend and stay again for definite. Just needed some drawers and 1 extra towel but the housekeeper did give us one âºï¸ lovely kind helpful staff. Thanks for a great stay;5
Hilton Hotel provides a lounge just off the lobby along with 3 restaurants. The Restaurant serves American cuisine in a casual setting for breakfast and lunch, while Rafael Steak House features Midwestern cuisine for dinner only. 20+ conference rooms offer 20,000 square feet of event space and banquet facilities.;5
Getting here by public transport from the airport was a trek but we got there in the end. Hotel is nice and clean, check in was quick and easy. Our room was really nice with great views of the hill sides and the pool below.  Room service was quick and the food was of a high standard.  Plus side is the free shuttle service to Universal Studios which leaves often but you can also walk which takes around 15 minutes. Would definitely consider staying here again.;5
This hotel is pretty reasonably-priced with decent amenities and present at a great location which is walkable distance from Times Square and Central Park. I primarily used this for sleep and the bed is comfortable without the mattress being too soft. On the whole, I really liked my stay and will definitely be visiting again.;5
Absolutely loved our 4 night stay here. Beautifully calm experience amidst the madness of the Medina. Every single member of staff is a credit to the place, but special mention to Brahmin & the boys, Elena (who was so helpful before we even arrived), Sarah at reception and Arjane who always had a smile!  The Riad itself is incredible. Our room was beautiful & the facilities amazing.  Everything you could ever need was either already provided or brought to you as soon as possible. We really cannot praise this place enough. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you x;5
Great location, reasonable price and friendly staff! What more can you ask for? The room was small (not unusual for New York) but clean and well kept. The beds were very comfortable.  I have to say that our stay was made so much more enjoyable because of Aali and Algernis at the front desk and Jeff the hotel porter! They went out of their way to help us! I definitely recommend this little gem!;5
Was in town on business. The hotel was Ok and the service is what I have come to expect from a Hilton property. The staff was professional. Good on site dining. The concierge was excellent in arranging a few fun side trips.;5
Due to the coronavirus I have to cancel my reservation, it was booked on hotel.com I did not cancel early enough so I was charge for $168 ,I recently contacted the hotel a young lady name Neida was a great help , I definitely will rebook with the hotel rebook with this Hotel again;5
I could not fault this hotel or its location for what we had planned in LA ,rooms were immaculate and food was excellent ,the seafood buffet was outstanding  ,all the staff were extremely helpful but a special mention to concierge lady who was on duty on Saturday morning on the 11th of April who was extremely helpful in contacting our tour guide for our Beverly Hills tour who had forgot to pick us up ,I would recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting Universal Studios ,Hollywood and surrounding areas;5
Our thanks go to Andy, Jeff and Hugo for making our stay so special - all of you were great! Had 5 nights in this hotel - celebrating our birthdays (my daughter and I) and were very well looked after. Very comfortable room with everything we needed - ear plugs a great idea!! Very convenient for all the shows we went to see and the shopping too! Had a great time and would definitely go back. Our thanks also to Front Office Manage Voldodomyr Kozak for all your help.;5
A really nice hotel,easy to get around. The metro was close ,hop on hop off bus stops at hotel. Everything has been thought about the rooms are beautiful I was very happy with my 4 night stay. The lifts were slow but they did apologize for that an they are doing them up. Just a 5 min walk to university studios, a must do so much fun.;5
Stayed for 4 nights hotel is clean .rooms  are spacious Maybe in some need of refurb but staff are helpful and friendly.  So close for lots of main attractions(10 mins walking distance) most of them but subway is just round corner from hotel. Used hotel diner ( excellent service and food). I would definitely stat here again!;5
The hotel is good value for money considering location, free breakfast, and ancillary amenities. Their flooring was laminate which I LOVE (feels a lot cleaner then pricier hotels where they do carpet cleaning maybe once a year!). They have an omlette station for breakfast which is a nice touch.;5
The hotel staff is very professional and courteous. The room is clean, modern, and has character. The location is convenient for sight seeing and is minutes walk from Times Square. I was very impressed when I arrived.;5
Our family of 11 members stayed for 2 nights in 3 rooms. We were welcomed by Ariel Larios at check in. He was very professional and provided the best customer service and upgrade me and my husband to a wonderful suite which we enjoyed very much. We ordered room service and we all enjoyed the dinner together in our private suite dining room. Thank you so much Ariel. We are definitely coming back due to your high standards of customer service.;5
My trip was both business and family. Even with the renovation that's going on in the hotel (I was told before I booked the room) everything was GREAT! The staff was super friendly and very helpful. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. It was worth every penny that I spent.;5
The lobby and other public areas reflect the architectural style in which the hotel was built, and are very well kept.  The rooms are small but efficient.  Every employee we encountered was pleasant, helpful, professional and welcoming.  The diner is - well, a diner.  It's cheap and perfectly adequate for a quick bite.  The Italian restaurant is quite nice.  We didn't try the pricey steakhouse so I can't comment on that.  I can tell you that the location of this hotel can't be beat!  It's right next door to the train station and one subway line, and just a block from another.  We highly recommend The New Yorker.;5
Awesome, clean, area, staff, my only problem was the in room dining service was mediocre but the rest was perfect, we will definetly comeback and make Hilton the only choice in the future LA vacation with family;5
I stayed in this hotel 20 years ago, when it was already nice, but now that its newly refurbished, it is really great. The lobby is supercomfortable for lounging and free wifi, the beds are really soft and big, there is no breakfast included in the room price and one has to go out to get one's own breakfast. The location is next to the Lincoln Center, 5 mins to the Central Park and the John Lennon House, as well as Columbus Circle and Broadway. Very comfortable and urban luxury stay! Earplugs recommended because either its loud from the street side or loud from the aircondition noise in the inner court. But thats NY...;5
Quick and easy check in, Pil was very helpful and friendly ð Will stay here again if I ever come and visited LA. Great location and near to Hollywood attractions (located on the main road, easy access by car/walking)  Metro station is very close (1 min walking) Onsite private parking;5
My husband and I really enjoyed this hotel!! The service was textbook hospitable. We received great recommendations from the gentleman at reception (I can remember his name and I wish I had asked!) We canât wait to be back!;5
Stayed over for New Years Eve just to do something different and out of our hometown.  The buffet dinner at CafÃ© Sierra was amazing, just so much variety and one of the best hands down, rooms were clean, the bed, pillow and sheets were so comfortable.  City Walk was a 5 minute walk, all in all it was perfect for us, we enjoyed it all and had a great stay, the view of the fireworks all around from our room was pretty cool too.;5
We stayed here for 10 days 23rd Dec 2016 to 2nd Jan 2017. The staff were amazing, the room was clean. A little small which is normal for NY. Not much counter space in bathroom. Only concern is that the bathroom doesn't have extractor fans so the bathroom and bedroom windows got very moist. Close to everything. View of Chrysler Building, Empire State and Madison Square gardens was a treat. Stayed in room 2137 which was great for 4 kids and 2 adults. I was given champagne and a voucher to tick tock diner for my birthday. Awesome hotel and service. If they could have a kids room that be great in wet weather to entertain them.;5
Our first visit to Marrakesh. We went for 4.5 days. Felt a little scared as did not know what to expect but hotel (Riad) sent driver to pick us up from airport, then he dropped us off outside Medina (the wall around the old town). The hotel sent someone to guide us on to the hotel. All staff were wonderful, very helpful, nothing too much. I need to avoid gluten and they even ordered gluten-free bread for me (although if you are Celiac you would find this difficult to manage in Marrakesh).  The hotel itself is amazingly calm, quiet and cool which is a surprise considering the hustle and bustle within the Medina. They have 2 small pools, a lovely roof terrace which is a lovely location to eat breakfast. (Tip - cover the jams to avoid a friendly group of bees to join you for;5
I cannot recommend this Hotel enough. From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. The riad is beautiful and smells divine, the service was fantastic and the staff were so warm and welcoming. We stayed for 6 nights and left in the evening of the 7th day. We were treated so well,  everything had been thought of and the staff really did take the time to make our stay special. It felt like we were amongst friends ð Thank you everyone at Riad Kheirredine ð;5
The service is extraordinary and the hotel is beautiful. I arrived early and my room wasn't ready yet, so JosÃ© from the reception upgraded my stay to a superior quality room so that I could go ahead and check in. Afterwards, ZÃ©, who is also Brazilian, was extremely patient and helpful with directions for getting around in New York. I had an absolutely perfect stay!;5
This was our first trip NYC and we wanted somewhere centrally located to many of the sites we wanted to see.  Wyndham New Yorker fit that need perfectly!  It was all we hoped for and more.  We stayed in an executive double room on the 8th floor.  There was plenty of space in the room, which was very clean and neatly decorated.  The bathroom/shower, while a bit small, was more than adequate for our needs as a family of three.  Beds were comfortable after a long days of sight-seeing. We loved the outlets/charging stations that were conveniently located around the room.  While I know that there are tons of restaurants in NYC, we loved the convenience of being able to grab a bit from the 24hr diner attached to hotel if we were pressed for time. From check in to check out the staff;5
From the moment you checked in your every need was catered for and the staff went above and beyond to make sure your stay there would be amazing, with fitness suite, restaurants all part of the hotel it was easy to plan your evenings and the location made it easy to plan how youâd spend your days touring the city, close to subway stations and the Empire State Building, Macyâs, Maddison square garden, you were never far from something that shouted New York;5
This is the best hotel near LAX, period.  Can't say enough nice things.  I am a frequent business traveler and every employee makes me feel welcome.  Joy, Bill, Judith, Derrick, Aida, the list just goes on and on.  All the baristas are awesome.  The Regency club:  superb selection of food and drink, but Cairo makes this place very, very special.  I started staying here because of its proximity to LAX, but I continue staying here because of the people.;5
The hotel was very welcoming. me and my friends spent 4nights here and one of the stand out people we met was tommy bellman, this guy located us all the top spots for dinning near by, aswell as helping us find the cheapest parking late at night.;5
Great place to stay, will definitely stay there again. Its was great not to have to worry about sanitation, the place was immaculate. The staff very friendly, Mr Pil was super nice at the front desk. Can wait to stay here are on our next visit.;5
Loved the room, loved the bar and rooftop lounge. The drinks were outstanding. Food was delish. Prices were fair. The bartender at the lobby bar was outstanding, and he even remembered me from a previous trip. The bed was cozy and the room was very quiet. I would highly recommend the Empire!;5
Stayed here just 1 night for a quick trip to Universal Studios and Hollywood (no kids, have annual pass and wanted to enjoy the park adults only).  The hotel is really nice, I would think it was a Westin or a Hyatt.  Room spacious and updated.  Didn't eat there aside from the walk up coffee vendor, who was a very sweet older man, he was friendly and funny.  Location was great to walk in and out of Universal - we went back and forth a few times - to change for dinner etc. - and took a tram/shuttle once which was a nice plus.  Would stay here again for a special overnight treat for the park!;5
When checking in, Nicole was fast and professional when getting us into the room. She was helpful lots of suggestions. The complimentary breakfast is incredible and we liked the courtyard at night. Thank you for your hospitality Nicole!;5
If you have an early flight out of LAX this is a great place to stay. Delta terminal is 2 minutes away, AA maybe 4 or 5 minutes. Hotel is nice. I did not use the restaurant, nor the bar, but I have in the past and it is what you would expect at a Hyatt Regency.;5
Clean and modern hotel with several options for food inside the hotel which was good after a long day of meetings. Convenient shuttle (which was packed at 5 am) to the airport the next morning. Best for travel out the next day from LAX, generally area is not great.;5
Great location and classic old New York hotel with lots of history.  The rooms are older but nicely done.  As Wyndham rewards members we were given great service.  Highly recommend this hotel for New York City.;5
Great experience in Los Angeles for my first trip. The hotel was a good add on to my adventure. The staff is very helpful and understands what guest need. Pil is the very best. He simply makes your day start good with a smile and hello.   I canât wait to come back and bring my family and friends to the hotel. I enjoyed my whole stay.;5
We had a great stay, staff were nice, location was great. However, the best part of our stay was the housekeeping. They paid so much attention to detail, even arranging my contact lenses! Our room was always spotless.   Our least favourite part was the tick tock diner, Iâm afraid. Food was not great, male servers very abrupt. However there was one nice lady. Overall our stay was great though. Thankyou again!;5
I stayed here in Feb 17. The location is absolutely perfect! 34th street tube station is just on the other side of the road, Madison Square garden is just a block away and Herald Square (Macy's) is just a five min walk from the hotel. There's also a McDonald's directly opposite the hotel entrance. The hotel is very big and really lovely decor, it feels like 'proper New York style'. The room it self was small as almost NYC hotel rooms are. Having said that it's all the space I needed! The bed was very comfy. The bedroom and bathroom are very nicely decorated and very clean. The shower head is fixed to the wall which is personally a pet hate of mine, and the temperature was a bit temperamental to start with but other than that it was fine. Plenty of towels and toiletries for my;5
You couldn't ask for a better zip code when in New York, step right out the door and you're a stones throw from Times Square. Really short walking distant to Central Park and all the shopping streets. Front desk staff and doormen really helpful when needed advice on where to go/eat. Bed was super comfortable and although noisy (to be expected in NY) the hotel provides ear plugs which is a great touch.;5
We stayed here on a Saturday night. The location is great for walking to Central Park or visiting the opera at Lincoln Center. The hotel room was spacious, well decorated quiet, and comfortable. The service was very friendly and professional. We were particularly happy to have met Pasqualle who made our stay even more special. Thank you for your city guidance and hospitality. Would definitely stay again.;5
New Yorker Hotel with originally over 2500 rooms was opened in 1930 and is located right in 34th street where the famous Empire State Building is also located!!! Over the years many famous personalities like  John F Kennedy and the legendary Mohammed Ali etc stayed here. The hotel is located just opposite Penn metro station and very near to the famous Time Square, However the room size has to be compromised. Further complimentary breakfast is not provided in the Hotel.;5
It was a great hotel and great customer services was patient and greet it us with a good attitude. They helped us out with anything I need and recommended us places to visit since it was our first time. Shout out to pil for the help, great guy!;5
Love staying at the Ameritania, have stayed here a number of times and have always been treated very good.   Great location, fabulous rooms and friendly staff.  Close to briadway theatres, times Square and;5
We just came back from a great stay in NYC made possible by our hotel. It was clean and comfortable and you canât beat its location, close to shows, restaurants, Central Park and so much more. And the staff was very friendly and helpful. Weâll stay there again.;5
Great stay! Would recommend hotel to anyone. Great location not too close to Times Square but close enough to be near to everything. Walking distance to most things. Staff were helpful with any question and soo accommodating. Would definitely recommend to anyone!;5
Just returned today after our 6th stay at this hotel.  We stayed for 8 nights and the room we were allocated had a slight issue with one of the bathrooms and the TV didn't work.  After reporting the issues we spoke to a gentleman on the desk called Driss he was extremely helpful and obliging and we were offered a different room for the next 7 nights.  We collected our new key card and found to our amazement that he had allocated us a suite Room 2530 .  It had 3 double  beds and a separate lounge area with amazing views of The Empire State on one  side and MSG from the window on the other side.  Couldn't  fault any of the staff inc the Maids  Doormen Reception etc;5
The ambiance was beautiful! The hotel was very clean ! Staff is super friendly ! I really enjoyed seeing the sights of the various planes land at LAX ! This was a great experience overall ! Maybe best to self park and Lyft or Uber because parking was expensive !;5
We had such a great experience here! All of the staff members were so kind and friendly. Hotel was very clean. So much to see and do right near by! You can walk to Times Square and Central Park. Very close to the subway as well. Great hotel!;5
My friend and I stayed here for 3 days for a concert at The Highline Ballroom.  We could not have been more pleased with our decision to stay here.  The location is primo and we were able to get around all three days by using the Jane's free bikes :)  Yes the room (bunk bed) is tiny, but when you are in NY you're only there to sleep anyway.  We were exhausted by the end of the day and just dropped and went to sleep immediately.  The hotel was surprisingly quiet as well.  The restaurant was fabulous.  The rooftop bar was fabulous.  The staff was fabulous. We even checked out the club on the 1st level but did not stay as it catered to a much younger set.  This is THE place to stay for anyone really, but particularly if you are in your 20s or 30s.  Loved everything about it and;5
Amazing omelets made at the HollywoodHotel, great customer service, freshly cooked and one of the best I've had in a long time.Thank you Hugo for looking after us and hope to see you again in the future;5
We just left after a 6 night stay and we were very happy with the hotel.. very clean and the staff were very friendly.  The rooms are large and the shower is very strong( important to me)We especially enjoyed the delicious breakfasts  They were really delicious  and the eggs and waffles were cooked right in front of us to our liking The hotel is very well located , close to metro and on the red line . We would definitely stay again Thank you for our wonderful stay Christian and Sarah ðð»;5
This hotel is not your typical airport hotel. Itâs extremely modern, VERY clean and all of the staff that I encountered were wonderful and pleasant, from 430 pm when I checked in to 4am when I checked out. I could barley hear any airport noise and youâre in walking distance from Terminal 1, although they do offer a free shuttle service 24 hours a day that comes every 10 minutes. Not to mention, I slept like a baby in their comfy bed.;5
My first time working with the hotel and it was a great experience.  The price was competitive. I had about 20 rooms for Saturday night and they were clean, sleek, and the sizes were just fine.  The location was very nice.  Right in front of the stairs to the Lincoln Center and a couple blocks from Central Park.  Close to the subway.  Icon Parking is right across the street if you don't want to pay for the valet.  Check-in was easy. Breakfast buffet was good. We didn't have to wait in line for access to the rooftop club.  The only issue I had was the elevator.   There are two sets of buttons (I'm still not sure which one was the right one) and it wasn't clear if some of the elevators weren't functioning but it always took forever to get back downstairs.  I guess it was a busy;5
I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport for a conference.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was Clean, comfortable!  The valet was quick and very helpful as well;5
Stayed at The New Yorker for five days and just arrived home. Really nice hotel not too far away fro Times Square and all the other must see attractions. We booked to include breakfast in the Tick Tock restaurant which is well worth the extra. If we come back to New York we will definitely be returning to the New Yorker.;5
Stayed at this hotel on the 12 th floor overlooking broadway and I wasnât disappointed  Jeff the doorman was fantastic room clean and tidy  Excellent position 2 min walk from Times Square if that and 5 min walk from Central Park Would stay again;5
This hotel is in a great location. Right next to Lincoln Center, and less than 2 blocks from Central Park. The staff are friendly and the rooms are quite nice. It is an older hotel, but very welll kept.  The night roof top night club is one of NY City's more popular spots. There are lineups Friday and Saturday night, but the staff managing the line will allow hotel guests up. If you only visit New York rarely, its worth paying a premium to stay in Manhattan, and at a hotel like the Empire.;5
I was slightly hesitant at the prospect of staying at a Riad, but a stay at the Kheirredine has re-defined luxury and customer care. Valentina and her team are wonderful: they pamper, care and guide without being intrusive. Better than 5 star!;5
This was our second stay at the Hilton University City.  It was just as wonderful as our first visit.  We arrived early and were immediately checked in by Stuart, who will go out of his way to meet every request.  We needed two rooms, close by each other.  Stuart checked us into 2 rooms on the 22nd floor, upgrading us, due to our gold Hilton status.  The rooms were available immediately and very close to each other.  Both rooms were immaculately clean, and the maids visited several times a day, removing and replacing used towels and freshening up the room.  Several times we were left trays of fruits and candies.  One room had a view of Universal that was incredible.  We could watch one of the shows, including the fireworks, from our room.  Every time we walked through the lobby,;5
Our family spent 3 nights in Marrakech prior to our Mediterranean cruise departing from Barcelona.  We prefer to stay in boutique hotels instead of the usual large hotel chains. We found Riad Kheirredine on Trip Advisor and were very impressed with the consistent high ratings and great reviews. Everything we read was very true!  --this boutique hotel is certainly a gem in a beautiful old city that is like going back in time! We were greeted by our fantastic hostess, Valentina, who gave us a brief orientation of the hotel and the city --along with tea, juices, hot face towels and assorted fruits and snacks! The rooms are excellent and make you feel like you are staying in a very exclusive home! A great touch was the city orientation tour by one of the hotel staff so we would not;5
We absolutely loved this hotel.  The staff was super helpful and the room was very comfortable.  The location was awesome.  We have will stay there again anytime we visit New York City.  A great place to stay!;5
Pil was amazing at the front desk. I stayed an additional night because the hospitality was phenomenal. He gave us a beautiful room with an amazing view. Cant wait to go back! He also checked in on us and made sure that our stay was going smoothly.;5
Great location within walking distance of many attractions!  Our room was on the 36th floor and offered a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building and the top of the Chrysler Building.  Close to Macy's, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and great restaurants.;5
"Excellent from start to finish we've stayed here before with our kids and we recommended my husbands brother and wife stay here 2 years ago well they've just had their 2nd stay everyone friendly helpful be back again"" hopefully "".";5
The front desk staff is unbelievably friendly and professional. Met all of my needs. Hotel is clean,pool area is great,bar and outside lounge totally melrose place.. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.;5
Jeff was always very hospitable and helpful during my stay.  He was a positive persona that helped me get settled for my three day stay at your hotel.  As a result,  I will book future dates.  Jeff is a positive attribute of this establishment.;5
Perfect hotel for visiting Universal-just a 5 min walk & you're at the front gate! Perfect for getting to the park early & also for taking a break during the day. Checked in late & asked if there were any rooms left w/a view or anything special & we were moved to a room on 14th floor w/excellent view of Hogwart's castle!! Room w/2 queen beds-the beds & pillows are SO comfortable! Excellent night's sleep! Have a son & daughter (12 & 13) so brought sleeping bag & pad so they wouldn't have to share-worked out great. (Fire code doesn't allow rollaway in rm w/ 2 Q's). Room super clean w/nice toiletries. We'll definitely stay here on future trips!;5
Very happy with the reception at this Hotel. The agent by the name of Chrystal???             was super friendly and very accommodating she went above and beyond the call of duty to check us earlier, and upgraded us to a super nice room overlooking The Empire State building. I'm partial to other Hotels, but the customer service I received will definitely have me back at this Hotel. Hotel has a nice memorabilia museum in the lower level. Also ask to see Mr Tesla's room.;5
Of all the hotels I have stayed at in NYC, this one has been the best. The location is amazing. The rooftop bar great. The atmosphere at the hotel puts you in a great mood.  The room was spacious for NYC, view of Lincoln center was awesome.  I have stayed at many hotels usually based on price, I got a good deal on my stay. I am returning to NYC in dec. And booked this hotel not based on price, but because it was such a great stay. The easy access to the rooftop bar was a great way to jumpstart the night too. Romeo at the front desk was extremely helpful as well.;5
Haven't stayed at a Hyatt Hotel in quite a while. My room was large and clean with a comfortable bed. Fridge available in the room which is always handy. Only problem was front desk couldn't break a 20 to leave a tip for cleaning staff. Would gladly stay here again.;5
Excellent Airport Hotel. Friendly, professional staff. Well appointed, comfortable, and spacious, the guest rooms are quiet and provide a good nights rest. Good work out facilites and pool. This hotel is a true quality hotel and is conveniently located within walking distance of the LAX airport.;5
Just returned from a 4 night stay in NY at the Ameritania Hotel - you couldn't pick a better location for a hotel - 5 mins from Times Square and 5 mins from Central Park. Hotel is quirky and modern and all staff were helpful, particularly Said, the doorman. Rooms were larger than expected for  NY although still not huge. The bathroom was excellent with large walk-in shower and a plentiful supply of fresh towels and soaps etc every day. Wardrobe was ok for 2 people on a 4 night stay but would be small if staying for longer. The only down side to the room was the radiator/air con unit which made the room too hot even when switched off at the wall (still emitted heat) - there was a control unit on the wall which I couldn't get to work. However, when I reported the room as too hot;5
Great hotel.  Perfect location for Universal studios - five minute walk.   Room was huge. Very clean and the bed linen is lovely.  Welcome basket of fruit, water, cheese and biscuits was indeed very welcome.  We were on the Executive Floor and the continental breakfast and hor d'oeuvres were a real bonus.  We ate at Cafe Sierra twice during our stay - delicious.  We particularly liked the BBQ buffet - very good value for money.  There is also a good choice of restaurants at Citywalk.  Other than Universal though there is not a lot within easy walking distance. The Metro station is walking distance but it is down a very steep hill.  Unless you are planning on only visiting Universal you really do need a car.  The car parking was $17 a day.  There were always plenty of parking;5
Amazing hotel! All of the staff deserve a raise due to their hard work and immaculate customer service! I hope that corporate for hilton see this review, because the staff are the reason we will return! Especially marina and Roberto at the pool! Thank you for the wonderful work.;5
Selected this hotel based on the proximity to Universal Studios. Less than a ten minute walk. The room was nice, clean with comfy beds and pillows. The lobby area is great and good for people watching. We were greeted by every employee with a smile. Although we didn't eat at the hotel, the buffet looked AWESOME! We had a view of the pool which looked great. This is now my hotel of choice when visiting Universal.;5
Stayed here from christmas day until 29th december. Check in was fast and pleasant the man on the desk (who's name I cannot remember) was extremely polite and helpful. We were in room 231 on the 2nd floor. The room was extremely warm. But I figured out within around 2 minutes yow to adjust the heater. We slept with the window open and did not suffer with any noise trouble at all. The beds were extremely comfortable. However. Many of the furniture items are old and tired and could do with replacing. The bathroom is tiny but does its job. The lobby is amazing and every gossip girl fans dream. The hotel is in an amazing location. 2 mins from central park. 2 mins from subway station. We had an amazing time and I would 100% return. Thank you;5
Stayed here at the end of October.  We had a fabulous room with brilliant views of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden.  Newly updated and spacious room.  Very well situated near Penn Station.;5
A lovely place to lunch!  Excellent food with friendly service! You need nothing else to make a very pleasant occasion other than nicer weather so that we could have enjoyed the sea view from the lovely patio!;5
Enjoyed my recent stay at the Hyatt as part of the GO2020/Table Coalition conference.   Location across from LAX was perfect, hotel was very updated, clean and well-maintained, workout room was one of the better ones I've seen in a while, and the staff was extremely friendly, and definitely likes to see visitors come back, which I am planning to do.;5
I didn't actually stay at the Empire, but i was there earlier this month to visit some friends staying at the hotel and I met them at the Lobby Bar for a drink before we headed out to dinner. The ambiance in the bar was great, there was a good vibe and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. If the quality of service at the bar and the quality of the bar itself are a reflection of the entire hotel, then I'm sure staying here is a great experience as well. Much like Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'll be back...;5
my wife and i stayed for 6 nights during the fashion week at the Lincoln Center over the road and arrived at JFK in a snow storm . The hotel is really lovely and the staff very helpful and friendly .I even got my picture taken at the Lincoln Center and and given a fashion agents card ..... at 54,  not bad !! The bar staff are really nice and Heather serving the drinks was special .... i could have easily have brought her back with me to the UK but my wife would have noticed !! We really enjoyed our stay as the location was great and everyone so friendly in New York .It has to be one of the nicest places that we have visited over the years . The door staff were so helpful and a great advert for service and a first impression of any hotel ...nothing was too much trouble with;5
This hotel is as advertised.  The rooms are typically sized by NYC standards (small) but very nice, stylish and spotless.  We could see Lincoln Center from our window.  There's a Starbucks and a small pharmacy/food store in the same building.  Rosa's Mexican Restaurant around the corner is terrific.;5
Excellent location and very well equipped with modern amenities.  Staff promptly brought me a missing item and provided extra coffee on my two night stay.  Overall I would strongly recommend this hotel.;5
The hotel was perfect in two ways: not only the hotel was walkable distance from the Universial Studio, but also the staffs were very friendly and made us feel extra cared.  I would like to particularly complement Astrid and Linda on their hospitality who helped us with check-in and out. I believe they demonstrated how hospitality should be delivered to the visotors, and Hilton should value such valuable employees.;5
In a city of teeming millions, the Empire Hotel at Lincoln Center extends a level of hospitality that I find most reassuring every single time that I visit the Big Apple for business or leisure. Whether itâs a warm and courteous welcome back, ample accommodations or extra assistance with services from Maggi and Pasquale, I rest in the physical and psychological comfort that The Empire will always be my permanent home away from home in New York City.  I look forward to my return!;5
"The Universal Hilton was conveniently located for our visit to LA to see ""Key Largo"" at the Geffen.  It was also a quick drive to Hollywood and Santa Monica.  The room was quite comfortable and the staff was great.  The play was also a joy to behold.";5
We stayed at this beautiful Riad for 7 nights and can't wait to return. Even before arriving we received excellent email communication informing us of how our stay could be enhanced. Our set Moroccan dinner on arrival was just the start of our superb gastronomic experience, in fact it was so good we ended up only eating once outside the Riad. An excellent breakfast was available until 1.00pm which made for a very relaxing start to our day. The service by all staff was faultless, the best we have ever experienced anywhere. A special mention to Arjane and Yassime who made our stay extra special. All water/coffee/juice is included as is a full laundry service. The whole place was impeccably clean including our beautiful room which was cleaned twice daily.  The Riad Kheirredine is;5
I totally loved this hotel!  It's old-fashioned charm amid the glass and steel buildings around it was comforting and delightful.  My bf and I stayed here while attending a toy show at the Javit's center.  It was an easy walk from the hotel right to the center.  Our room was amazing!  Probably because I expected it to be small and merely a room with a bed in it.  Instead, it had a separate sitting area with a couch and desk, a mini kitchen area with refrigerator and sink and a Keurig!!  That's fancy smancy compared to the usual mini coffee pot.  My only complaint - if you call it that - was no decaf coffee.  They may have had some if I'd called, but it wasn't that important.  If it was there I would have had it.  Otherwise, it was cool.  But, there was some sleepy time tea and;5
Great hotel to stay at if your visiting Universal Studios. Our room was clean and spacious. The buffet for breakfast is great with many options for food. Customer service was excellent. Jerome helped check us out and was fantastic. He took care of a small problem and made sure we left happy. We will be staying here everytime we visit the area. Thanks again, Jerome!;5
I love good airport hotels. This is one of them. I have an obsession about staying close to the airport the night before early flights out or when I arrive late into town and this one is my favourite at LAX. It was unexpected because I don't expect much from airport hotels but the renovation that was done was high quality, recent and the price was great. I will be back.  When I walked in late at night, about 4 people greeted me with very cheery, genuine smiles and I thought that was a good sign because it means they are so happy to work there even so late. Pretty much everything was flawless - the breakfast, my limo which they ordered for me to travel to West Hollywood and the room.  Only downside is that taking the shuttle can be a pain at LAX but it arrived very quickly.;5
"If you are looking for perfect service and genuinely friendly people then look no further in Marrakech! I stayed with my friend for 3 nights in the Rose room and we are already looking to go back! From beautiful breakfasts on the terrace to the mobile phone you are given to ensure you never walk by yourselves (2 girls) it was perfect in every way. Well done to the team and thank-you for everything- including the watermelon you bought us as we ""looked like we needed something fresh!"" perfection.";5
The staff is very accommodating and any issues were fixed within the hour. The private  rooftop will make you never want to leave. The hotel buffet breakfast is great and very high quality. You can even leave your belongings before and after checking out for a few hours to explore hassle free;5
Highly Recommend!! From the minute you step inside you feel like youâve stepped into paradise! The staff treats you like family and goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect! They make you feel comfortable navigating the MÃ©dina and assist you with making reservations and booking excursions. We had dinner there twice and both were excellent. You will not be disappointed when choosing this riad!!;5
Its my 3rd time staying in Empire hotel  and i absolutely love it, nice clean and close great food bars and shopping area, the guys who work at the door are amazing too, very good guiding you in the area;5
The room was clean & I loved the toiletries (great scent w/ organic Argan oil)! The staff was friendly and helpful in all parts of the hotel. I was only there for one night, but happily would have stayed for longer. The pool looked nice from my room, but I had such a quick stay that I couldn't take advantage of the amenities. I did have dinner & drinks in the bar and breakfast at the cafe.;5
Miss Neida Aldama, the communication Manager at the New Yorker Hotel, was very helpfull with our booking. She was so nice to sort out everything and contacted us several times to make sure that everything came well. Thank you so much for all the work you put in. We realy appreciate it.;5
We stayed in a Captains Cabin for 5 nights in early August.  The rate was very competitive with similar hotels without the amenities here.  First, the staff was smartly dressed in old school hotel staff attire and acted the part.  The room was adequate in size but seemed larger because of smart design (large lighted wardrobe with safe and interesting minibar, TV mounted high in the corner, king bed with end tables and reading lamps, clock radio with I pod dock, room light controls near each end table, a bistro table and two chairs for noshing).  The bath was surprisingly large with, robes, slippers, and nice toiletries.  Room service is available from the in-house restaurant which is sort of North African.  We had dinner and breakfast here and we're not disappointed.  Prices are;5
We spent three nights at the Hilton Universal City in Los Angeles.   The location is perfect for your trip to Universal Studios, there is a Shuttle between the park and the hotel (every 20min) but you can also walk, only 10 min. Perfect!   The reception was very friendly. We used the valet service, it was an ok price at 28USD/day, it was quick and efficient. The lady at the hotel reception was very welcoming and friendly and you did feel very appreciated as a guest.   We had an Executive King Room on 21st floor. The view was breathtaking, we had a view over the whole Universal Studios Area and could see Downtown LA (when it was not too foggy). The room itself was very spacious, one King bed, one sofa, work desk with chair, TV, lots of space for your clothes. The bathroom was;5
I didn't actually stay at this hotel, but I went to the Rocky Horror Picture Show 40th Anniversary convention here, which was the first Rocky Horror convention that I went to. I am a big Rocky Horror fan, and I had a great time here! I got to see a lot of Rocky Horror fans, including some people from my local shadowcast, The Zen Room! I also saw a lot of interesting panels, and the preshows that I saw were great and funny. I also got to meet Nell Campbell, who played Columbia in the movie! I can't wait for next year's convention in Providence, Rhode Island!;5
I checked in and got a upgrade ,deff a plus. Front desk staff was very helpful always had answers for my questions and needs. Rohan stood out to me always having food options and solutions, my room was not serviced for a day and I did not leave the DND sign on door but Rohan ensured I got fresh towels and toiletry replacement. Bell staff Denise was amazing friendly and welcoming also. Would stay again.;5
Location and hotel are beautiful. One block northwest of Central Park. Out of hustle and bustle, but steps away from everything.  Beautiful rooms and very nice, caring staff. We visited this hotel as part of my daughters gossip girl tour and fell in love with it and moved from our room at the ROW NYC that day. Will stay here on our next visit.  Thank you Julie and Piasquiacle.;5
Super close to LAX Airport. Clean room with a comfortable bed and my shower. I would definitely stay here again for the convenience of the location.  The only problem we encountered was the free Wi-FI.  The signal was super weak and hard to get online.  Free parking was a huge advantage.;5
Great stay at the Hilton Universal. All staff we encountered were helpful and very friendly. Rooms were of a great size for my family of four which includes two teenagers. Hotel isn't cheap but the service and location are why. We walked to Universal theme park and Citywalk whilst we were the there, no more than 10 mins. The location is second to none for Universal. Lots of comments about the lifts on TP, don't worry the lifts are fine, we had no problems. The hotels positions staff in the lobby to manage the lift situation, we stayed for four nights and never waited longer than a minute for lift. Great stay and would definitely stay again.;5
What a fantastic hotel! We could not be happier with the first stop on our honeymoon. Once they found out we were on honeymoon they upgraded our room to a suite with a perfect view of the Empire State Building. The staff are so friendly and nice. John in the concierge will go out of his way to ensure you have the best time on your visit. The location is so central you can pretty much walk everywhere of interest. We will definitely stay there on our return trips.;5
What a wonderful introduction to Marrakech and Moroccan hospitality. The exceptionally thoughtful and friendly staff went out of their way to ensure we had a fantastic stay. The rooms are beautiful, tranquil, and so comfortable, and the facilities immaculate with really high standards maintained at every turn.  Very generous hospitality with light refreshments always available and a lovely welcome whenever we returned. The staff were careful to ensure that we didn't get lost and took remarkable care to ensure that our connections and arrangements for transferring to our next hotel went off without a hitch. We were given brilliant recommendations for restaurants and places to visit, and the general level of care we received made this a restful and thoroughly enjoyable time in a;5
We stayed At the Empire hotel for one week this month, we really enjoyed our stay, Mor (Radmy) and Almasa were amazing and made our vacation better then we expected, thank you very much we will definitely come back!!;5
When in Morocco, if you want an authentic experience you must stay in a riad. There are 1900 of them in Marrakech. Riad Kheirridine is at the top. Elena was our contact and she anticipated all of our needs before we left the states. She lined up guides, drivers, dinners, etc. Can not say enough good things about her. The riad itself is elegant, quiet and relaxing. Breakfasts were lavish on the rooftop. Their restaurant was better than the highly rated ones.;5
We stayed at this hotel with friends and I have to say we will definitely go back.   Room was very clean, bathroom spotless and very comfortable beds. The staff is so nice and helpful.  shout out to Jeff!  thank you    Cheers;5
Great stay here. The health & safety measures including temperature scans upon entrance mitigated my nervousness about staying during the pandemic. Mohammed at the front desk was extremely helpful and kind in accommodating me with everything I needed in a quick and efficient manner. Canât thank the staff enough!;5
Great location--right next door to Hudson river where you can take a nice walk up and down the path.  Great service--staff are very friendly and accommodating. I asked the two people down at the front desk (Kevin and Archie) for a good pizza place nearby to try and they recommended Artichoke Pizza which was a few blocks away. It was an excellent pizza place and I was very happy with their recommendation.  Clean room--the rooms were designed as if you were in a boat cabin. I stayed at a single bed room, which was small and cozy and very affordable. It has all the amenities you need: heat/air conditioning, TV, outlets, and Wi-Fi. There were also communal restrooms/showers which were kept very clean.;5
Recently refurbished room to a nice standard. A comfortable stay in a fabulous location, just minutes from the London Eye and tube station, lots of attentive staff at breakfast time where sometimes can cause problems, this hotel has it just right, they didnât run out of food or crockery like other locations I have experienced.  Well run establishment and I would highly recommend.;5
"Guest Services was nice , room was decent , i received an upgrade , "" because a better room was available at the same price "".  All around good experience. Great Location!";5
We are having a wonderful experience at Empire Hotel in NYC!  The guest services individuals Pasquale and Sheri were awesome!!  Pasquale has helped us several times throughout our stay and has truly made the experience a lasting memory.  Thank you to those two individuals specifically and all other guests services in the hotel.  Happy to stay here and will definitely come back!!;5
The room was amazing. Very big, loved the esthetic!! The sauna was a plus!! This is my 2nd time here will be back a third! I would highly recommend this hotel!! Loved the pool and the homie feel. Must go place. thanks Pil;5
"I genuinely am struggling to critique this hotel, which is probably the issue with TripAdvisor as it tends to encourage negative feedback, but no need to worry with this Riad.   I work in luxury travel and would recommend  this to everyone; the staff were all amazing, friendly and put so much effort into making sure you have wonderful stay.   Watching the sunset on the rooftop while enjoying a traditional Moroccan meal is just everything I wanted from my stay in Marrakesh. They make you feel very safe here, and offer to walk you to the Souks on your first day, and give you a local phone just in case you get lost (not sure if this offered in every room). Free laundry service and a lovely breakfast offered each day, I would say hand on heart exceptional value for money.   Location";5
The New Yorker is a great hotel. Perfectly located with easy access to Penn Station, the subways and walkable to the theater district, Time Square and Rockefeller Center. Also, Jack Doyleâs is just around the corner on 35th. Plus, the Art-Deco style of the hotel, its little âmuseumâ downstairs, and the Tick-Tock Diner makes for a very entertaining stay.;5
Literally right in the middle of all the action. A fun, themed, great getaway for singles, couples and families- alike. Big and small. Enjoyed the ambiance of the surroundings, in addition to the choices for dining. Great decor, layout, friendly staff and lots of things to do onsite. Clean, well kept and comfortable. I took quite a few photos and wish I could share. However camera was lost at the airport -( hopefully, I will get back soon, but I'm sure there's no way to reproduce this kind of fun. Loved it!;5
I go into the city for concerts frequently from CT, and don't want to make the return drive home after a late night.   This is the second time I've stayed at The Jane - and I still loved it.    I was worried about the bed bugs situation, but I had no issues whatsoever.  I found my room to be clean and tidy, as well as the shared bathrooms.  I also had no issues with noise.  When I returned from the show, the downstairs club/people were obvious and noisy, but on the 5th floor, I heard nothing.  I was able to sleep without any issues.  If you have an issue with shared bathrooms or small rooms, then don't stay here.  It's as simple as that.  The site and many reviews accurately describe that the rooms are small - just big enough for you and your stuff.   That is what this hotel is;5
My friend came from Florida on a trip with me. lPil helped us from the beginning, he was very welcoming, showed us the room before hand, set us up on the third floor, and overall some of the best service I have received in a while.;5
Hectic Thanksgiving weekend. The hotel was a sanctuary of calm elegance. Excellent staff. All very professional. Excellent food at restaurant/lounge. Valet service very prompt and professional. Would recommend staying here if you have to fly out of LAX;5
Staying at the Hollywood Hotel was a true delight . Beautiful room, friendly staff, clean and spacious location . I especially enjoyed the support of management. Nelson was extremely helping with our reservation and explained our stay in great detail . Another staff that was extremely helpful was Pil who gave great customer and delicious recommendations at local restaurants. Overall highly recommend this hotel.;5
I simply cannot overstate how amazing this hotel is. The service is as good as any hotel I have stayed at anywhere in the world. From the moment you arrive until the moment you leave the level of attention is first class. The facilities are excellent, the food on the restaurant very good, spa treatments are great. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. As truly awesome experience.;5
Where to Start!  My wife and I stayed at Riad Kheirredine last week for 3 nights, there wasn't one thing that I would have changed. This place is one of the pearls of Marrakech and it's impossible to be in any way disappointed if you choose to stay here.  We decided to stay in an imperial suite which are the newest addition to the Riad, you can tell that every detail has been though of when designing the rooms (pure contemporary class with a Moroccan theme).  Breakfast was lovely and plentiful and could be served at any time anywhere in the Riad!! The 2 pools were intimate but great. I think above all it was the service that stood out during our stay. ALL staff members couldn't do enough to help you, they were all so polite and you know that they genuinely just want to help you;5
It is a fantastic location. The staff are very friendly and helpful,  especially Mohammed at check-in.  The bathroom needs more shelf space.  The rooms were cleaned early and were well done. I would stay here again.;5
I am tiding up my holiday pictures and I get nostalgic about a special place that I visited in April. Riad Kheirredine is a pearl in the middle of the Medina in Marrakech. The Riad is a traditional house that was turned into a beautiful hotel. The interior designer had sophisticated taste choosing high end furniture and decor from local makers. The atmosphere is enchanting and not the least intimidating. I was there with my family, including a toddler and a pre-teen, and there has been no time when I felt like their needs were not respected. The place is relaxing and romantic, yet children are welcome. The staff is amazingly welcoming with people of all ages, actually: everybody made us feel like we were part of the family. We were offered delicious food for snacks, breakfast,;5
We were greeted and assisted by very courteous bellmen(Harold) when we arrived. Steve at the Honors counter assisted us immediately and provided us with early check in. The Sunday evening buffet was fabulous with Jovita and Antonio providing us with wonderful service. We are very low maintenance guests and made a request with guest services for 2 sets of towels, bath mat, facial tissue. Waited more than 1 hour so I went to front desk to see if there was a problem. The front desk person went to make a call and said the towels will be delivered shortly. When delivered about 10 minutes later, only towels were delivered, no bath mat and no facial tissue. We requested a light bulb be replaced but never done, we continued to move a bulb from lamp to lamp to get light in different;5
Old, wood, granite and marble At affordable rates and splendid views! Clean cabin rooms near the Whitney and High line. A subway line from Pen station or walk. Staff is friendly and helpful. Shared bathrooms are tile and clean.;5
Stayed at this hotel early January. Excellent service. Great location. Friendly and helpful staff. New contemporary style hotel. Clean and spacious rooms!  Highly recommend this hotel for an excellent NYC experience. Forgot something in the room after checking out and the Manager actually retrived it and sent it back to me ! This is the type of hotel that takes care of their guests ! I look forward to my next stay at the Empire.;5
I was wowed by the super efficient, friendly reception at the the front desk. The customer service is excellent! The newly renovated rooms are fantastic. The room and the stuff are very clean. And they have the best prices in NY that you can get. Very close to the subway (just accross the street).;5
"Front office manager Kevin Finister, General Manager Randy Romero and Front Desk hotel clerk amazing people to work with and give ""5-Star"" treatment! My wife and I have been staying on quick nite getaways for a long time and recently celebrated our 6-year anniversary with Hilton USH!   We love the hotel, reservations are made easy, we always get the room we wish, high floors which we have become used to, and the treatment is always perfect from check-in, dining, valet to check out.  As I shared with Kevin when I checked out yesterday - Astrid has gone well out of her way on several visits, to make sure we have the highest floor possible when available.   Kevin and Randy are an amazing team to work with, which is why I choose to stay at Hilton USH.  Thank you all for making our";5
Great stay as always The receptionist Erica was particularly helpful. She went out of her way to assist. The air conditioning was magical as the weather outside was 40 degrees. The location of the hotel is perfect for all the London attractions;5
Itâs centrally located. Close by is Starbucks and a pizza place at 2am for two large slices and a water for $2.75! Itâs a very expensive city, but if you look, you can find hidden gems. It would be best to go with someone who has been there before.;5
Our 1st trip to NY and it was during NYFW! We stayed at the New Yorker and it was fabulous. Everyone was very helpful and nice. It is a beautiful place to stay and in a great location. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that will be traveling to NY.;5
"I recently stayed at the Empire Hotel.  Not only was the hotel very nice and convenient for my meeting but the Security Team at the Hotel went ""Above and Beyond"" in my opinion!  After checking out of the hotel last week, I realized I left several DVDs for a course I am taking in my room safe.  Two of the  Empire Hotel Security folks, Lionel Vassell and Jospeh Louis, took my call (as I was driving back to Pittsburgh, PA) and immediately retrieved the items from the safe.  The next day, they had them delivered (via FedEx), to my home.  It worked out perfectly since my class starts on Monday.  I GREATLY Appreciated the work of the Empire Hotel Security Team! Thanks, Mike M.";5
Very clean and hygienic, very nice receptionists, we enjoed our vecation, and the best part was a very kind man who works in Ameritania, his name is Jeff, he explained us everthing, he guided us and we are recommend this hotel, its located in the best place ever;5
My girlfriend and I stayed in the empire hotel for 3 nights, and we had an amazing time. The hotel is situated in a very nice area of New York, right in the middle of everything. The hotel was great, but what especially separates it from any other New York hotel was the staff, specifically Adam, Sarah, and Karma. I had a problem with my room, and alerted the staff about it, Adam did not hesitate to accommodate my girlfriend and I. We were given a new, upgraded room. We were also always greeted and given water whenever we asked, along with whatever else was needed. This was greatly appreciated and I would not hesitate to book with the Empire Hotel for this reason. Once again thank you Adam, Sarah, and Karma!;5
I have stayed at this hotel many times.  The doorman have gotten to know me by face.  They all are great people.   I showed up a little early but had no problem checking in.  Front desk seemed to be on it more then the past.   Rooms clean location is great easy to get to most subways.  2 blocks from 9th avenue with gets you out of the tourist area and to lots of great places to eat.;5
We stayed at this hotel on December 18, 2019. The next day we went on a cruise. We came back from a cruise on January 3th  around 8:30 AM with our luggage to take a tour  from this hotel (We previously booked a  tour on Dec 18 with Star-line through the hotel). The hotel stored our luggage for many hours while we took the tour in Los Angeles. When we come back from the tour, late afternoon, the personnel helped us with our things to take the free shuttle to the airport. Our flight was at 10:30 pm on January 3. So, what else we can ask? Excellent service and friendly welcoming from the entrance by the personnel, helped us with our luggage, and we refresh ourselves before and after the tour. They really took care of us from the first day we arrived to this hotel. So, if you are;5
"It was one of the most beautiful hotel where we have ever been. The staff of the hotel was incredibly helpful and kind from the first second of our arrival. That was a surprise we could reach fresh fruits everywhere in the riad and we could order tea, lemonades and so delicious orange juice whenever we want. (It was free of charge). On the first day we got a smartphone with Internet connection and we could reach the Riad every time. When we left the Riad to having a dinner outside of it the hotel staff always accompanied us to the restaurants at night and back to the hotel and it gave more ""safe"" feeling during our vacation. We suggest this Riad to everyone who want to spend a couple days or weeks in this lovely red city. It is the perfect place to enjoy the Moroccan atmosphere.";5
We spent ten nights here over Christmas and got a free upgraded room due to our length of stay.   The room was spacious and neat. We had a great view of Madison Square and the Empire State from the window.   The bathroom was again spacious and included both shower and bath. There was a walk in wardrobe and basic amenities.   Only gripe I had was no fridge or coffee making facilities. Not even a kettle. A coffee machine could be hired for $50 a night!!    NYC is pretty loud and continues throughout the night. Iâd suggest ear plugs for light sleepers. There was no noise issues from inside the hotel, more outside with the sirens and traffic.   Overall, if youâre in NYC, you really only need a bed for the night. We found the New Yorker to be a great stopping point and central to so;5
This properly certainly did not disappoint. Beautiful property fantastic location, amazingly quiet, fantastic service and awesome room. We would highly recommend LAX is in your future. Conveniently located right near the terminals.;5
Excellent staff, best breakfast I have ever had and a super cool hotel from the courtyard, to the exterior, to the balconies.   Located close to subway.  Could not ask for anything more.  You will not be disappointed;5
We have just returned from a 3 night stay at premier Inn, county hall and what a visit it was! Location of this hotel is absolutely awesome for sightseeing. Right next door to London eye, sealife and dungeons and a stone's throw from Big Ben, HIP and Westminster abbey.  The staff were extremely friendly and we had a fabulous breakfast each morning to set ourselves up for busy days! We did have a meal in the restaurant on the first night, and it was ok (nothing wrong with it, but didn't eat there again)  Breakfast was busy between 9-9:30 so if you can avoid these times This hotel also do a early check in and late check out for Â£10 each, which we did take advantage of so we could make the most of our trip without worrying about luggage.  Westminster is the nearest underground;5
Loved our stay here - the staff were superb, they couldn't do enough for us and went out of their way to be helpful. They were happy to escort us anywhere, recommend and book restaurants, and had lots of great local knowledge to help us make the most of the stay. We were even given a mobile to use which we could call if we got lost! Other highlights include - drinks available (plus home made Moroccan snacks) whenever you want, free of charge, beautiful terrace for sunbathing and eating, great breakfast served wherever you choose to sit, lovely decor. Very hard to fault anything - the internet was patchy but we didn't need it so not a problem.;5
Friendly check in, comfortable and clean rooms. Iâve stayed here multiple times while passing through LAX, solo, with kids, and with friends. Always a good experience with friendly staff. Itâs not the cheapest hotel near the airport but worth the money, IMO.;5
"located in an atmospheric part of the Medina; just the experience arriving to this Riad was exotic. The level of service was extraordinary and the attention to detail was evident throughout the property. Its important to mention that there are 3 levels of rooms, for those with difficulty walking request a room on the lowest floor possible as there are no elevators! The breakfast was substantial with a great assortment of local jams,  almond butter (mmmmm) pastries and eggs upon request.";5
Daniel was excellent and very helpful.  Unfortunately though, the internet connection was spotty.  It kept booting me out and not letting me back in (this happened on multiple days), even when I rebooted the computer.  Then I asked Daniel about paying to allow multiple devices to connect.  Iâm thinking that if one device isnât working that another might.  But that was news to him -- no one had told him about any new requirements to gain internet access -- previously customers were allowed to connect multiple devices.  To me this sounds like a management disconnect -- not good when we require Internet access to conduct business.  Daniel tried to help with the Internet connection -- and I think that worked eventually, because now Iâm able to access with one computer.  But what if;5
The New Yorker with its elegant style was a great hotel for a business trip!  Everything was very nice, very clean and very quiet!   I would particularly like to point out how friendly and helpful Anianna was in the checking process. She was very nice after a long trip for me, and extremely helpful.;5
I have been at the hotel for two days and have been great. Very comfortable hotel. Very nice and modern room.  The best thing was the people that runs the hotel. I was attended by Gabriel at the front desk. Excellent guy. Solved all my problems and concerns. I will be back. For sure.;5
You may find a more opulent Riad elsewhere, and / or in a more central location, but it's all about the service here. It's all been said in the other reviews - great breakfasts, the mobile phone etc. What really sets this place apart is that you really get the impression the staff are generally interested in you, your needs and ensuring you have a great stay in Marrakech. Our special and hearfelt thanks to Yajaira, Elena and Jochi - nothing was too much from start to finish. We booked 3 nights for my wife's birthday and had a truly memorable experience. Don't hesitate -this is number 1 for a good reason.;5
Stayed here for five nights on my honeymoon . Room was nice and cosy . Bed comfy and everything was nice and clean with fully working air con . It looks like they have recently renovated the hotel . The area can be a little of putting as some of Vermont avenue is run down and a bit sketchy but if you stick to your car you will be fine  . The car park is secure you do have to pay but where do t you in la . Pool area was exceptionally nice and you can tell they take very good care of it . I would stay here again if visiting la again;5
The Jane is quirky and historic.  I found it charming.  We stayed in a captains room with private bath.  Decent size room.  View of the river.  Vintage furnishings with recent updates.  Comfortable bed, small table and two chairs.  Nice shower with good water pressure.   Friendly staff.  Pricing a bargain for Manhattan.  Cafe and bar on premises, both somewhat limited.  No hairdryer (maybe only in communal bathrooms?) and slow elevator.  Some wear and tear of a minor nature.  We would book again. .;5
What a gem of a find. Part of the county hall building next to the London Eye. Amazing. We had a view of the London Eye from our room. Stunning. Fabulous location and it was buzzing with atmosphere. The rooms were great as always. Breakfast was very good indeed. A busy hotel as it was near Christmas but the staff were so polite and very hard working. The lady on reception upon our arrival was so efficient and personable. Bar prices were expensive but it is to be expected in London. A lovely service from start to end. We will be back.;5
The hotel is in a nice location, convenient to Lincoln Center, Time Warner Mall and Central Park.  Rooms are clean and spacious for NYC.  The rooftop lounge is a must during your visit.  Very fun and eclectic crowd.  Recommend highly;5
This hotel is located about two blocks from Hammersmith station where three metro lines converge. There is also a bus station attached to the subway station so you are basically connected to pretty much all of london. We had a private two-bede room... the size of a closet, but very clean, with good heating and EXCELLENT beds. Bathrooms and toilets were OK. There was hot water at all times and plenty of it. The kitchen (there were several on our floor was a bit scanty, but I did not use it. They provide towels, cutlery and dishes (in your room). No lift. It is like a gigantic dormitory with white hallways. It was very nice and quiet... WE only saw or heard people going by our room twice. If you want a cheap but comfortable place to stay in London, THIS IS IT. PS Staff was polite;5
Wen we arrived the room we were given was an express queen which is what the travel agent booked for us, it was extremely small if staying here I'd stay away from them rooms. We upgraded to the junior suit for an additional $100 a night but it was worth it!!! The room was amazing with great views and you couldn't ask for a better location. Nearly everything in walking distance and subway just down the road, central park is right across the street! Staff really polite and friendly. We will be back again sometime in the future! We had a great honeymoon!!!;5
I can only confirm everything said by other reviewers. The Riad is a gem. The place is beautiful and charming. But what makes it special is the staff. Sorry, I can't remember all the names and I don't want to miss anyone. But, Guys, you are terrific and you made our short holiday exceptional. We miss you already and love to come back one day... After all it doesn't happen everyday that the riad manager gives you a farewell hug... :)));5
My friend booked us this Riad after reading the amazing reviews. We have travelled a lot in the past so we have experienced a lot of different hotels. This one is by far the most special we have ever experienced. The service is out of this world. We had read about it but you will not understand the level of kindness until you stay there. All the staff were warm, funny and tried their hardest to make your stay special. And their kindness is truly genuine. We fell in love with Marrakech and will be returning - there is no other place we will stay at than Riad Kheirredine for sure. Thank you Elena, Sarah, Asmae and all the beautiful staff at Riad Kheiriedine for making us feel extra special on our trip. We will always be greatfulf for your efforts.;5
Every wonderful thing you have read about this riad is true!  Valentina, Yajaira and the entire staff made us feel like we were visiting family.  Indeed, when we couldn't make arrangements for an established cooking class, they arranged for us to shop, cook and dine with a local family which became the highlight of our whole Moroccan trip.  Thank you Abdul and family!    Also be sure and take advantage of dinner at the hotel as it turned out to be the best meal we had.  Although we have been traveling all over the world for many, many years, this was a truly unique and memorable experience.  Don't miss it! Barbara and Barry Martin;5
The Empire Hotel was located in the Perfect location.  The King Deluxe room was clean roomy and very comfortable.  We ate at the restaurant and were extremely impressed with the staff and our meal. I Highly recommend it.;5
Our stay at Riad Kheirredine was second to none. It was in an amazing location and you really felt like you were in the heart of real life in Marrakech (whilst being in your own private preserve within the hotel). The rooms were beautifully coordinated and there was so much attention to detail! The team were fantastic and were full of recommendations, advice, local tips - we felt really looked after. I also felt very safe as they had staff who would escort you to and from locations as well as drivers who were prompt and responsive. This place is all about the small but important touches e.g. providing us with a phone so were contactable at all times, they sent someone to collect you if you managed to get lost etc. The layout of the riad also allows you to have a private;5
Our room was lovely - not brand new but clean and comfortable. The staff - front desk, housekeeping, bellman - were all wonderful. I would definitely go back. And you cannot beat the location so close to Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, great food, etc. And an easy walk to Midtown.;5
Last night, for the third year in a row, our non-profit organization held an event at the Empire. The staff bent over backwards to help in every way possible to make it a success. A fantastic group of people who are committed to quality service. KUDOS TO THE EMPIRE!;5
WARNING PHONE SCAM AT HOTEL DO NOT GIVE ANY INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE. This is not from the hotel but an outside person calling rooms and pretending to be the front desk asking to confirm cc details as the computer system has gone down. On arrival great service considering the holiday congestion at the front desk stored luggage at no extra cost defiantly a great hotel for the price. Right on the red subway line;5
First visit to a Hilton in a long time, did not know what to expect and was not expecting much. Big surprise, very nice property, exceptional people, great value!  I'd like to mention some people by name- Jovita, Tina, Jeanette, Violetta, and especially Atefeh! Just awesome, genuine, hospitality.  The room was very nice had exactly what we needed, very comfortable. Property is very well kept on the outside, we walked over to Universal and there were beautiful plantings all along the side of the hotel. See if you can find a secret hidden fish pond :-)  We ate breakfast in the morning, which offered a variety of price points and buffet style service or menu service, which was very nice this way we could do exactly what we wanted.  We also ate happy hour / dinner in the lounge;5
Our family of 5 arrived in Marrakech at the tail end of a month âroad tripâ through Spain, Portugal and Morocco.  From the moment we arrived at the Riad after a long day of travel, we were treated by Elena and the rest of the staff there as if we were family.    The Riad is a slice of heaven nestled in a Medina that is exciting, exotic and fun, but can also be overwhelming and tiring as well, particularly for the kids. The Riad itself is beautiful and very charming, as can be seen in the pictures and is even more impressive in person.  The wonderful pools, the numerous areas to retreat and relax, especially on the expansive rooftop, with a book or a glass of wine (or to watch the World Cup, as we did on several occasions with fellow guests) . . .   However, it was the staff and;5
Ideally situated to enjoy London , close to Waterloo . Staff were very pleasant and we were able to leave our luggage on our arrival even though it was too early to check in. Everywhere was very clean and family room was plenty big enough for the three of us with comfortable beds. Breakfast was plentiful and well cooked, the scrambled egg was superb. We would certainly use this inn again.;5
My wife and I spent a week at this hotel. From the minute we arrived. to the minute we left we were very pleased with every aspect of our stay. The room was clean and made up perfectly. Front deck staff were quite knowledgeable of the area and were very helpful in steering us in the right direction. Hugo and Sonia were in charge of the breakfast area. They both were so kind and attentive. Hugo made perfect omelets for my wife and I loved the waffles. Lots and lots to choose from. I would highly recomend this hotel.;5
The location of the hotel was perfect for our visit to the Hollywood area. We were able to bring our small dog and there was a dog park nearby. The room even had a small balcony overlooking the attractive courtyard for a breath of fresh air. Although it appeared to be a wood floor, the room was tiled and perfect for pet owner peace of mind (fortunately, our pet didn't make a mess) The breakfast was a complete hot and made-to-order feast. The friendly ladies making waffles and omelets were wonderful each morning. The desk clerks were gracious and helpful.  I would recommend this hotel as a great value in the area.;5
Had a lovely stay in this beautiful riad, which is in a quieter area of the city but within easy reach of the sites. The staff were caring and attentive (but not too attentive), and ensured that our stay in Kheirredine and Marrakech was all that we wished it to be. Nothing was too much trouble. Yassine, in particular, was a star. Breakfast by the pool in the courtyard, evening meal on the roof terrace with the sound of the call to prayer in the background  - what could be better?;5
We booked one night at the New Yorker for a quick visit to NYC.  Due to a medical emergency, which occurred in the hotel lobby, my family and I spent several nights at this hotel.  The accommodations are quite nice.  Very clean, updated rooms at an affordable price.  What is most amazing about this hotel is the staff;5
Look for Mandy Rassuli, Sales and Marketing Director. She will do the best she can to make your event a memorable one. Easy to talk to and very nice. Held our company Holiday party on 12/15/17 and it was amazing. The table settings are nice. Decent venue and the food was very good! It can accomodate 100+ guests with a very reasonable price. Everyone in our company had fun and hope to do it again next year.;5
We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and Iâm glad we did. We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights which is an excellent location, room was clean and comfortable which is the most important aspect for us, 3 of us stayed in the room with no problem, I'm not bothered about the size of the room because this is not where we're spending all our time during my holiday so no complaints from us.  The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Majid at the front desk for all his helpfulness, thank you!!  I surely would recommend the Ameritania hotel to anyone visiting NYC;5
I would thoroughly recommend the Jane Hotel to any travellers coming to NYC.  The location within The Meatpacking District is spot on, with the leafy Greenwich Village and Chelsea a short walk away, with great connections to both Uptown attractions e.g. Times Square, Empire State and Downtown e.g. Liberty and Staten Island Ferries.   The hotel is clean and comfortable, with lovely bedding and excellent shared facilities. Whilst the rooms are small and can get stuffy in the summer, a good blast of air-con will solve this problem very quickly indeed.   However, where the hotel really excels is its staff. Friendly, approachable and above all incredibly helpful, my interactions with the staff in this hotel actually formed a highlight of my first trip to NYC.   In summary, the Jane;5
We stayed here for 1 night for convenience to visit Universal.  The service was great, and the room was fantastic- as you would expect from a Hilton. Seriously - one of the most comfortable beds Iâve ever slept in!  The buffet breakfast was delicious and I definitely recommend this as it will fill you up for the day!  There is a free shuttle to Universal, although itâs only about 10 mins if you want to walk.  Would definitely stay here again....;5
Location is great! This hotel gives you that NYC feel while not being too expensive. The spotless room allowed for a great night's rest and the hotel staff was incredibly helpful with any request we had. They made us feel very taken care of during our time in the city--Nicole Agnello was especially welcoming! This hotel also had a great bar on the rooftop. Definitely recommend.;5
We are a family of four and loved this hotel. Clean, sophisticated decor, great staff, and excellent location within the city. One block walk to Central Park! Across the street from Lincoln Center where we saw free outdoor concerts. Easy walk to plenty of restaurants and the train. We didn't pay $60 to valet park, found a lot behind the hotel for $40/day.;5
This hotel is so close to the airport, you'd think you could walk (but don't). There was no noise coming into the room from the planes. The room was absolutely beautiful! A little far from the other hotels if you want to go to dinner elsewhere. However, it is easy to walk along West Century Blvd. Just a little busy with all the traffic going to and from the airport.;5
Upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to a stunning double room on the 29th floor with incredible views and the Empire State Building as the most perfect view. The room is lovely spacious and airy, very clean with extremely comfortable beds, even with all the outside noise you should sleep ð¤ well. The front of house staff have been just fantastic. Could not be more helpful. Any little problem they have sorted it.  We are currently on our third night out of 5 nights.  This hotel came highly recommended. It is in the heart of NYC and everywhere is in with easy reach. Broadway is a 10 minute walk from the top end. 10 minutes to the Empire State Building. 15 minutes to Ground Zero. Highly Recommend and if you shop around you can get some great rates for staying here.;5
We had a wonderful stay at the Americana Hotel.  Janet in the reception area was very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for her.  She booked some Broadway shows for us and was a mine of information regarding places to go to shop for the specific items we were looking for.  She is a credit to the hotel and we can't thank her enough. Having someone like this to help is invaluable for travellers.;5
Wonderful two day conference combined with an anniversary celebration with my husband.  We would come back again and recommend to others. Enjoyed staying at the Empire rather than the Hudson. My husband felt the same way.;5
I don't write many reviews but felt I needed to for this Riad as we had the most perfect stay.   Apologies in advance for the long review but hopefully it will help fellow travellers. Not only to make the best decision to book this hotel but also tips on surviving the hustle & bustle of this beautiful city.  So in all honesty we had reservations about visiting Marrakech and had heard a lot of off putting stories about getting hassled by locals, not being safe, pushy sellers / snake charmers & getting lost in the maze of small streets. However our experience was far from this.  The Riad Kheirredine wow.... this was truly an exceptional experience. The excellent experience didn't just start when we arrived as we had been in touch with the hotel before our visit planning various;5
Most impressive was the check in process where Assistant Director, Michael, made me feel welcome and seen. The room overlooked the Empire State Building, so the mornings were spectacular light shows as the morning colors rose from the bottom of the Empire State Building. The sheets were like new, and the bed itself very comfortable.   GREAT customer service. Very special room in New York.;5
The location is good, not too far from multiple subway entrances.  We felt safe in the neighborhood.  The room and bathroom areas were very clean and in very good repair.  We arrived with a car and I didn't realize there is absolutely nowhere to park.  They quickly checked me in as I parked illegally outside and even carried our bags to the room.  When we checked out, I accidentally left some items in the safe and they sent them to use via FedEx and just billed my credit card.    The rooms are very small and I didn't realize how to get the power turned on until I called the front desk.  Friday night was a little loud with music coming from somewhere, but Saturday night we didn't hear a thing.    The room rates were great and I would definitely stay there again.;5
Best sleep ever! Best staff ever, especially Majid, but they all made us feel at home. Best shower. Very nice amenities and decor. Perfect location. AND very reasonable. Have already recommended this hotel to friends . ðð»;5
Stayed here January 2020 and couldnt fault one thing. Staff were friendly and helpful from the second we arrived to the second we left. Hotel was clean and well maintained. In a brilliant location to times square. Would definitely recommend!;5
Excellent location great staff. Walking distance  to the heart of midtown Manhatten Subway just a few minutes away.  We wlked to Columbus  Circle, coursed over to Central Park and had a drink at Tavrern on the Green.;5
It is a fantastic location. The staff are very friendly and helpful,  especially Mohammed at check-in.  The bathroom needs more shelf space.  The rooms were cleaned early and were well done. I would stay here again.;5
Lovely hotel in a great location and with the added bonus of a rooftop pool & bar I stayed here in August 2016 and being a little concerned with some of the reviews was pleasantly surprised and booked to return this year already. Staff were lovely, but we were out and about all day so didnt spend much time at the hotel.  however we did use the rooftop pool & bar along with the main bar in the hotel lobby.  Really funky with great music and enjoyed every minute. The location is ideal, a bit quieter than Time Square and the hub od midtown but close to everything. You just need to be aware, like most New York hotel rooms, the rooms are on the small side and the bathrooms are too.  But if you're not there to stay in your room then there really is nothing to be disappointed about.;5
My mini staycation at the Empire was an absolute dream. As a New Yorker, my expectations for the hotel were high and I'm pleased to say the Empire met and surpassed every single one of them. The lobby atmosphere was great--upbeat music and friendly staff. Had a chance to interact with Jose Galeano and Gregory Cau, whom were extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. Would totally recommend this hotel to friends and family.;5
Hyatt Regency LAX is the closest hotel to the airport.  The shuttle service is frequent and fast.  The hotel has been renovated and is very comfortable.  I arrived late at night, and staying here beats renting a car or jumping into a taxi and checking in 30 minutes later at a non-airport hotel.  5 stars!;5
The room was very comfortable with a mini frig and within easy walking distance to the theme park.  Rooms were very clean and quiet.  The restaurant was excellent with an amazing seafood buffet but pricey. I attended meetings and the conference area and conference food was great.;5
We went to celbrate our daugher's 30th birthday with her partner and two other couples, friends of theirs.  We had free transfers from the airport as we were staying for four nights. We had a beautiful suite with shower and bath.  The rooms were all styled differently.  There was a wonderful roof terrace on different levels with huge comfy sofas to lounge on and bowls of fresh fruit.  The views over the old Medina were lovely and all you heard were the calling to prayers from all the various towers you could see around you. You could also see the Atlas Mountains in the distance.  Each day one couple had a hamman and massage which was a wonderful experience. The staff from the top to the bottom were all wonderfuly friendly and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble. Staff took;5
"I have a group staying at the Empire hotel and I have to give a ""two thumbs up"" to the following staff; Aaron Collins (Director of F&B) and Gabriel Zahriyeh (F&B Manager) for their professionalism, flexibility and wonderful positive attitude. They helped make our rooftop cocktail hour a total winner and a great welcome for our guests from Switzerland. They arranged a last minute private area on the rooftop for our group and since the group liked it so much they wanted to stay a little longer and both Aaron and Gabriel were very accommodating making it a smooth transition. Thanks guys, and we will be back!";5
Great stay no issues. The Doorman Movrad is awesome very helpful. My family came to New York from Florida and had a great time. The hotel is in a great location and is for sure the best bang for your buck.;5
We stayed at the Riad Kheirredine between 21st o 26th Feb 2016.   We organised a airport transport directly with the Riad, which was a great service, from greeting us in the arrivals hall to a porter and Riad employee helping with our luggage from the taxi drop off point to the Riad front door, about a 5-10min walk depending on how fast you walk.   We traveled with a baby, under 2 years old and this really helped to take away some stress of arriving in an unknown area.   It takes getting used to walking through the interlinking passages and the local pace of life in the Medina, but we had no safety issues and were constantly reassured by Riad staff, tour guides, other Riad guests and local residence.   We actually started enjoying the challenge of navigating the Medina which was;5
We had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. If you plan to have a vacation with your family, this place is definitely a must try... Staffs were great especially Nicole and Beatriz. ð­ They were very accomodating and friendly. Keep up the good work and stay pretty girls ðð;5
Park west hotel is a great place to stay. Great staff and all you need for a few days trip. Would definitely be returning. Nice location away from the hustle and bustle of NYC. Has plenty of subway stations near.;5
We stayed here for a trip to Universal Studios and enjoyed it.  The lobby and some of the common areas look like they may be ready for a reno (even still it was not offensive) but the room was modern and clean.  The staff was very friendly and willing to help.  The proximity to the studios was wonderful and easy to walk and they had a nice shuttle as well.  I would definitely stay here again when visiting.;5
My daughter brought me to New York as a 60 th Birthday present and we stayed in the NewYorker and were not disappointed with our stay rooms were very comfortable and spotless, should I ever get the opportunity to come back to your fabulous city I will be staying in the Newyorker;5
We were very pleased with our stay here and even decided to walk over to the airport.  Fortunately, CA didn't allow right on red at the busy intersection to cross the street to the airport and of course the hotel offers a shuttle but we wanted a little exercise.;5
We stayed for a week and wanted to stay forever. The Riad is amazing, the staff are like friends and make you feel welcome from the very first minute you arrive. Everything is perfect, words cannot describe this place, one must go and see for themselves. We will be back for sure. Dorice & Thomas Switzerand;5
This hotel opened in 1930 so is older but very well kept. Many of the rooms have great views. You can't beat the location. You can easily walk to Broadway/Times Square, Central Park, Penn Station, 5th Avenue and many other great places. You do have to pay to valet your car, but parking is onsite and you can park your car prior to check in. That's a huge advantage for getting around in the city. This is a great value and experience.;5
The hotel is perfectly located if youâre visiting Universal Studios. There is a shuttle that will pick you up that runs every 15-20 minutes, however itâs only a 5-7 minute walk. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. Every staff member we encountered was very nice and accommodating. However, a very special shout out to Yolanda M. at the front desk.  Our check in was a breeze because of her. She was very kind and most importantly, very professional. It was an absolute pleasure having her as our first encounter upon arrival.;5
I love this hotel, I will be staying for the fourth time in a couple of weeks and everytime I stay I have a fantastic time. All of the staff are lovely and very helpful if you encounter any problems, they will also try their best to move your room if you are unhappy with it for any reason. It is very secure as the security check your room keys before you can enter the lifts, which i love, especially as the surrounding area isn't the best. The bigger rooms are definitley better if you are staying for a longer period of time, the metro ones are fine- but there is not much space for two people. The tick tock diner is a massive bonus! I eat here nearly every morning of my trip and the food is always quick and super fresh! I really can't wait to stay here again in a couple of weeks;5
The room was very nice and comfortable, maybe just  a bit dark. We had a view of Lincoln Center. The location was perfect for our visit, as family was just around the block. Also, close to all types of transportation. The staff is friendly and engaging, always inquiring how everything is going. The free WiFi is available only in the lobby. Looking forward to returning.;5
I always stay here when I come to the city and it gets better each time!  Rooms are clean and spacious, I can walk to so many attractions and dining. I never miss eating at Alfredos just around the corner.  Julian at the door goes above and beyond to get a cab, see that you get where you want to go and offer friendly helpful service with a smile... love him!  The front desk can answer any question you might pose!;5
The hotel room was clean and the staff Nancy and Dena took really good care of us! Grat location , close to universal studios. Would definitely stay here again!    They have a cute court Yard. And they have gated parking .;5
My husband and I had the most remarkable time at the Riad Kheirredine. We arrived late at night and were incredibly impressed and happy at the rose petals decorating our room in celebration of our anniversary. The staff really seemed interested in speaking to us and were so incredibly kind. They made reservations at phenomenal restaurants for us and we cannot wait to return and to recommend this hotel to our friends and family. Amazing experience!;5
Great hotel next to LAX. Clean, great customer service, friendly staff. Our room was great and hotel shuttle to airport was quick and easy. Pool was very nice. Lobby large and welcoming. I'd stay here again for sure!;5
Friendly, efficient, professional, clean rooms and fast service. Highly recommend this hotel.   Thank you to Phil and all the front office staff for always being nice and helpful. Will deff recommend this hotel.;5
Great price, great room, great staff. Rooms are always super clean, functional with great extremely comfortable bed and linens.  Always wonderful too that they offer a parking deal at their wonderful location.;5
Wonderful hotel with a view of LAX. Planes taking off and landing so cool. Staff was very helpful even connected us to tours and local eats, thank you Eduardo! The hotel restaurant was the absolute best the most delicious food and wine I've had in a while time. Definitely underrated. So even if your not staying here but in the area check out the short rib lollipops and the drunken noodles.;5
Incredibly kind and friendly staff. Rooftop bar was wonderful.  The staff and management were incredibly gracious to us as healthcare workers as we had to cancel our reservation twice. They were under no obligation but do so anyway. Would highly recommend this hotel;5
Pil was very helpful, the hotel was very nice and my pet was very welcome just like I wished, definitely coming back! The pool was open and going to the gym while I enjoy my vacation is great, live being active.;5
While sinking into sticker shock looking for a reasonably priced hotel in New York in mid September, I came across a listing for The Jane.  They were advertising a room at about one-third the price of the next cheapest place in the city.  Turns out the $110 tariff was for a very small room with bunk beds and a shared bathroom.  Another time, I might have been tempted, but we opted for a larger double with private bath for $330.  The room turned out to be terrific--elegant even, and the hotel itself a kind of cool retro/antique classic with great staff in the wonderful West Village.   The Jane has a terrific cafe (the Gitane) in the building where we had a great breakfast and lunch.  The eatery has the same ultra cool atmosphere from the Orient Express decor of the room to the;5
Great location from universal studios walking distance and shuttle is available from hotel . Great food and clean and great hotel for families. Room service was great since we have a 2 year old it was real easy to order food from tv app then was delivered to room . Food was real good;5
The Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City is a great place to stay if you are visiting Universal Studios and/or the Burbank/Hollywood area.  The rooms are spacious and clean, the staff is friendly and accomodating and parking is easy.  The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from Universal Citywalk and there s a free shuttle if you want to skip the walk. All in all we had a very good experience at The Hilton!;5
Marrakech is a magical place with its souks, alleys, mosques, food, dance....and its' very own scent! This is not a city where you would want to stay at a Hilton or a St Regis even if there was one around. This is a city with hundreds of small hotels or riads, and this Riad Kheirridine is undoubtedly the best! It is not wonder that they have consistently won so many accolades and publicity. The property is very small and hat adds to the experience, they probably have more staff on property at any one time, than there are guests! The rooms were luxuriously decorated and had a very traditional Arabian feel. The food is always a-la-carte and freshly prepared. You get constant supply of fresh orange juice and Moroccan tea, laundry being done for you, room being service not once but;5
One block away from central park and walking distance to many attractions this hotel has a great location in a nice part of town. The rooms were clean and spacious. All the staff really put themselves out to help. Manana in particular was extreamly helpful and always friendy. If you have a sweet tooth check out the Bouchon Bakery in the Lincon Centre it's amazing. Next time I am in New York I will be staying here.;5
What can we say - what a wonderful stay!  An oasis of calm above the madness below at ground level in the medina.  Valentina and her team are absolutely first class and the Riad absolutely beautiful.  We simply could not fault it.  I don't think they have seen the last of us.... stunning.;5
After a long and tiring train journey we were welcomed by A professional courteous and smiling receptionist called Krystal.  She went out of her way to accommodate us.  She is an excellent advocate for this hotel.  The hotel is very central has all required facilities and we particularly enjoyed tick tick restaurant for breakfast.  Excellent stay at friendly hotel  Art Deco style;5
Iâve never written a review on TripAdvisor but I felt compelled to do so after my recent stay at this hotel. I donât care about how modern or hip or whatever bells and whistles most people care about. Location and view are more important for me. I usually spend very little time in my room anyways.   My kid has never been to NYC and my wife has never stayed in NYC. So I wanted a âWowâ factor. Mission accomplished! I got a queen suite with a view room. Which was not all that expensive. Had no idea I was going to get a corner room with Balcony that was bigger than the room. Not only that, but we could see the Empire State Building, Chrysler building, and MSG all from our room and balcony. This saved us a lot of money. We had planned on going up the Empire State Building and top of;5
The New Yorker is the best ! Located in the center of everything, complete with comfortable beds and great high-pressure shower in Art Deco bathtubs (love my baths)â¦  and the views are spectacular. There is a 24-hour NYC diner attached to the property called TICK TOCK which is great! There is an Italian restaurant also attached -also very good.. and in the basement below the TICK TOCK?: a kicka$$ steak restaurant called the BUTCHER AND THE BANKER, which is fan-tastic !!! It is located in the marble and wrought iron gorgeousness of a former 1930âs BANK. People are literally eating in a beautiful VAULT! A vault the likes of which Al Capone and Rockefeller could have hid massive slabs of gold. That thing is huge!  The flagship MACYâS is so close-by, tooâ loved thatâ They have a;5
We spent 9 days in New York and wanted to be near Lincoln Center as many of our work events were there and the location/convenience of the hotel is amazing. There are great restaurants all around, a Starbucks and drug store on the same block as well as the subway. Very safe! However, what gives Empire a 5-star is their customer service! We had to leave for a couple of days for work but knew we would return and they allowed us to store one of our suitcases at no cost so we did not have to take it with us. Most hotels charge you to store your luggage for a few hours while you wait for your room or when you check out but not ready to go to airport, Empire does not and the doormen are so friendly and attentive! We definitely felt spoiled! The gentleman at check-in named AJ was so;5
"Definitely recommend others get an ""Empire"" experience! I love the decor, the staff, the food! I have no complaints. I was very satisfied with my stay and plan to return when i'm back in New York! Thanks!";5
I travel a LOT for my job so hotels are not usually that impressive to me but this one was exceptional in so many ways!  The lobby and bar area are super hip and there is a great little food & beverage shop right in the lobby in addition to the very swanky bar area. Every detail has been attended to in the contemporary decor...even the lighting.  My stay was too short to experience the fitness center but I heard it's got a great view from an upper floor. Most importantly to me, the rooms are not only very updated but impeccably clean! For once, I did not immediately feel compelled to pull out my travel sanitizing wipes. Also very important despite it's proximity to the airport the room (which was actually facing the runway) was almost completely quiet.  The beds are enormous,;5
We have just returned from 4 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker hotel. Lovely hotel, we were given a room on a renovated floor and the room was clean, tidy and everything you need for a base for exploring the city. It had a coffee machine in the room too which was great.  The only grumble I had was the $29 a day charge for wifi and use of the business and leisure facilities. Well we didn't use the business centre or fitness facilities so $29 a day for wifi was a cost we could have done without. They do tell you at check in about it so it's not sneakily done but as far as I'm aware it's compulsory so we didn't have a choice.  The location of the hotel is excellent, walking distance to everything. We have never been so tried exploring a city!! Madison Square Garden is opposite and;5
So when I first found out I was going to Marrakesh, I was excited but i also had some trepidation around the big crowds, the busy streets and the general mayhem of Marrakesh. The Riad Kheirridine completely puts your mind at rest on all these points. Firstly the Riad is beautiful, the rooms are stunning, the roof terrace is a lovely place to come and relax after a tiring day walking the streets of the medina. The breakfast is first class you have so much to choose from and you can sit on the terrace and watch the day start. When you are ready you can dive into the Medina, the staff send you on your first trip with a staff memeber to guide you through the streets to the main market and the souks. The Riad provides you with a phone so if you get lost you can phone them and they;5
room typically small for NY but served it's purpose. Chris the Concierge is the bomb! He made our stay in NYC fabulous! He was more than helpful- he went that extra mile and always appeared pleased to do so. Every hotel should have a Chris! He is the the KIng of the Concierge!;5
rooms were small and a limited view.   location was great for travel by train. walking distance to nypenn. actually close to port authority as well. for those travelling by bus. subway entrances on corner. typical ny diner on ground floor.  a bistro on ground floor as well. felt safe. can walk to times square as well.;5
Hotel in a very good and  central position. Very clean. If you choose the deluxe room, it is wider and more comfortable. The staff is very helpful for every need and always with a smile on the  face which helps a lot!!!!;5
We visited this hotel for 1 night and it was perfect. The rooms are very nice, the gym is pretty large and has weights for everyone. The pool has a bar where you can eat outside or order food to be delivered. The bartender who worked on August 11th was superb. She asked me if I wanted to taste the sangria and then went on to tell me about things to do. She also made none alcoholic drinks for my girls. The cabana's around the pool are first come first serve-which is a nice touch.   We had a continental breakfast included with our room and were able to upgrade to the full buffet for only $10. We were in shock. No need to go anyplace else for breakfast.   The concierge gave us on point tips about parking near the walk of fame. We toured the TLC theatre and they validated our;5
At $99 a night, you have to be realistic about what you can expect here. The location is great. I love the neighborhood. The subway is about 6-7 blocks away (14th and 8th subway) I love the street that The Jane is on. I felt like The Jane is in another city and NYC just happened to be right next door. It's different from the hustle and bustle that you'd expect NYC to be. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and filled with bars, restaurants and shops. Apple Store,Chase, CVS, Starbucks, Wells Fargo and other convenient stores are nearby. The Jane is also in the same neighborhood as Buddakan, Pastis and Spice Market which are the restaurants you must try when in NYC. There's a bar in the hotel and seems to be the hot spot among young professionals. The room is quite small but;5
First and foremost, this property is situated in Universal Studios Campus. If you are looking for a hotel devoid of tourists, this is not the place for you.  I stayed here 6 days on a business trip. As a HHonors Gold Member, I had complimentary breakfast and internet access in the room. Many other reviewers complain about paying for internet. This is comparable to every other hotel. If you do not want to pay for internet, you may use the free wifi in the lobby and atrium.  This property feels like a Resort Property. I have stayed in one of the Hilton Vacations properties, and this is very similar. There are shops and restaurants and bars all over the property.  I was on the top floor (which is a long elevator ride, but I never noticed any elevator madness like stated below, and;5
I stayed at this Riad with my daughter(5 yr old) and we stayed in the Sandal room. We stayed Monday thru Friday and the service was awesome. The staff is really what makes your stay the best, always there to help! They were always available to help. A great first impression was upon arrival from a morning flight, we were sat down to a bountiful breakfast  along with wet towels to clean our faces and hands(ahhhhh :)) The food was great, they have an Italian cook along with 2 local cooks to cook traditional local food....ahh the chicken tajine....heavenly...and since my daughter and I came from italy, she of course wanted italian, so we got that too! I spoke a lot with one of the workers there who is extremely nice from Phillipines and told her how much I liked filipino food...and;5
Empire Hotel is the perfect hotel that offers you Best of All Worlds. It is perfectly located between Central Park and the Lincoln Center. It's fabulously located in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which is close to all Broadway shows and Times Square, yet far enough that one can enjoy privacy and upscale lifestyle. The Management of the hotel is exquisite. Joe, the assistant GM is one of the very few people one can wish to encounter with. Not only he accommodated all of us with amazing hospitality, he happily took in any additional changes and on top he sent us a welcome champaign, which was a lovely surprise. Empire hotel became Home away from home from our first visit and I highly recommend it to Everyone who visits New York City!!!!;5
Our stay at The New Yorker Hotel was truly exceptional!  We were celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary and we booked a two-room suite with a terrace.  We asked for a room with a great view and the staff listened & delivered.  The view from our room was AMAZING!  The staff at the hotel went above and beyond to make our stay a pleasant one.  Special thanks to Erica L., Ramona & Mohammad who were especially helpful.  We would recommend The New Yorker Hotel to anyone visiting the city.  We even loved the photos and news articles on the lower level depicting the history of this iconic hotel.  The convenient location, the wonderful staff, and the memorable views all made for an unforgettable stay in NYC!;5
My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights, the longest stay on our 5 city trip. Having taken advantage of a half price offer online when booking my stay this hotel was such a bargain! Located on the outskirt of Hollywood the hotel had everything you'd need.  Positives: large comfortable bed, clean sheets everyday, very clean bathroom with clean towels every day, lovely decor in room and surrounding hotel, free wifi, free breakfast every morning, and nice pool.  Negatives: the only negative is that it is not made very clear when booking the cost of parking. Although having experience in 4 other cities, the parking at this hotel was actually VERY reasonable.   Not sure what the immediate surrounding area is like on foot as we would drive to most places, LA is massive and walking;5
"It has been many years since my last stay at the Empire Hotel, but one must say, ""what a surprise"" to see and enjoy this small and beautiful hotel. Great Location and easy access to mass transit. One is greeted by a beautifully decorated and spacious lobby and a professional and welcoming staff. Check-in was fast and the reception was very welcoming and accommodating. Rooms are generally small but very well appointed and most of all, very comfortable. Loved the shower since they use the ""rain"" type of shower...WOW! The mini bar is extremely well appointed as to please anyone. The beds are very very comfortable. The decor is modern and the rooms are impeccable/immaculately clean. The rooftop bar is impressive with ""average"" service but the overall atmosphere is great and pleasant";5
As a solo female traveller staying in New York for the first time,  I was a little anxious about where I stayed and the cost - The Jane was perfect.  Its a few subway stops from the main uptown (Times Square etc) and downtown (Liberty Island/Brooklyn Bridge etc) attractions and the West Village itself is full of fun, interesting things to see, eat and do. Even walking later in the evening, the area was vibrant and full of life. The hotel itself is very quaint and has a lot of character. If you're not used to pod style hotels the size may take some adjusting but there is plenty of storage space, the bed was firm and the room had all the necessary mod-cons of a 3/4* hotel (plus a full length wall mirror). The co-ed bathrooms were spacious, very clean and empty all the time - you;5
The hotel is very nice and staff very helpful with any questions you have about NYC. This is my 2nd stay at this hotel. I liked that it was close to Central Park and Time Square. Would highly recommend this hotel.;5
This was our first time in New York and straight away found the staff very helpful. The Hotel itself is ideally situated for Madison square gardens and the empire state building, there's lots of staff around the lobby more than willing to help you. The rooms are clean and reasonably priced. There are two resturants and bars and a diner, we ate in all three and found the food great, and the bars where also good, and reasonable. I would definitely recommend staying here as you have everything you want.;5
I spend approximately 20 to 25 nights a  year in NYC and started using the Empire a year ago,and this is the only place I will stay. The check in experience is excellent especially if you are fortunate to have either Zunachy, Minerva or Maggie assist you with the check in. Everyone is quite solicitous and willing to go the extra mile.   I highly recommend this hotel for not only the location but more importantly the staff;5
Iâve stayed in some amazing places around the world, but Riad Kheirredine is really something special! I can honestly say that I wouldnât even consider returning to Marrakesh unless I was staying here! The place is beautiful and the team who run it are amazing! Made my trip!;5
I was traveling for business and attended a conference as a vendor when the shipping company I used decided to cancel cancel the pickup the day my item was to be shipped back. Since this had never happened before  I went and spoke to the bellman about who to speak with about shipping and find out what process the hotel had in place. I spoke with Danny Ilaga. He was incredibly helpful, very thorough, patient and kind! I was able to completely handle my shipping with his assistance. Thank you for taking the time (he was busy) to stop and make sure I was able to solve my shipping problem!;5
Nice hotel , suit our budget . Family of 6 , stayed in two rooms for 6 nights. Rooms are clean , helpful & freindly staffs ,free breakfast is a bonus ! . Very good location , 2-3 minutes walk to metro station .;5
This hotel was perfect for our needs. We travelled from England and werenât looking for glamour or luxury. We wanted a cheap clean place to rest our heads so we could spend more money out all day exploring and thatâs what we got. The air con was amazing and what I needed after long hours in the nyc sun. The tv was very modern and the room was clean, couldnât ask for more. My friend asked to move rooms due to noise on the street (didnât bother me) and they did so immediately. 100% will stay here again.;5
The service at this location is perfect and everybody is polite. A place that you feel like home. Everything you need is inside the hotel and Universal Studios are in walking distance, 5-10 minute walk;5
Super nice clean staff, modern clean baths and rooms, walk in showers with rain heads and sprayers. Very comfortable new beds, great views directly across from Lincoln Center and a multi level indoor and outfoor rooftop bar with 2 bars !!!;5
Great hotel! Lovely staff that treats you right! Super close walk to Universal. Second stay here and will continue to come back! Great breakfast, well kept rooms. Free shuttle to Universal Studios and back!;5
Excellent facility and service.  Only issue we had was that the rooms smelled like tobacco smoke despite rooms being non-smoking.  This could certainly be an issue of customer non-compliance rather than hotel cleanliness.;5
This was a Great hotel, with a fantastic location. The room was a little bit on the small/tight side but had an Extremely comfortable bed. All the staff are really helpful and even offered to upgrade our room. But because we had been traveling all day we just wanted to unpack and go to sleep. Jeff the bell Man was extremely helpful and really went out of his was to give us extra information;5
We stayed at the Hilton for a few days and loved it. Friendly service, nice rooms, good restaurant, and easy walk to Universal and CityWalk. Note that the walk does involve a set of stairs to an overpass so anyone with mobility issues could find it difficult.;5
Loved the staff, clean & quiet location was great, just felt it was insane to pay to park at a hotel you pay to stay in, prices should include the parking lot????  Pool area is relaxing and beautiful, gym was equipped, a sitting area in the hotel also;5
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Universal City Hilton. I was upgraded to a corner king room that was very good sized, and had a bathroom that could have accommodated 3 people very easily. The view from my room was directly overlooking Universal Studios, and I enjoyed watching the tourists from my window.  A couple items to note. Even for business travelers in Los Angeles, $30 a day for parking is a bit steep. Also, for Hilton Honors guests, there is no executive/concierge lounge. The ""cold"" continental breakfast is comped in the restaurant, and the hotel charges $10 a person for upgrading each day to the hot entrees (I did particularly like the ""Wall of Donuts"" that is included in the complimentary items). At other Hiltons without a lounge, the hotels have offered a";5
Some of the friendliest people in California work at this hotel. From the check in to check out the customer service was superb. The room was nice, comfortable, and clean. We walked to universal studios from the hotel. I would recommend staying at the Hilton property. The pool area is nice as well. We didnât eat at the hotel so I canât offer any advice about the food.;5
"Enjoyed a little staycation at the Empire Hotel for the All Star Weekend. The Empire team was nice enough to offer a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite upon arrival; thanks to Pasquale and Daria. The service staff is overall very attentive and friendly definitely made me feel welcome. Thanks again for the great stay! I'll be back soon !!";5
I had a great time at the New Yorker Hotel. Very nice hotel with helpful staff. Classic New York hotel walking distance to Time Square and the Jacob Javitz Convention center.  The only downside was the room was very small, but I had a good time staying there and would stay there again. This was my 2nd stay.;5
From the moment we were picked up from the airport until we were dropped back 5 days later, I can honestly say that this was the perfect experience and could not have wished for anything more from everyone at this Riad. When we were greeted at the hotel, we weren't just shown to our room, but given our own tour of the place and were made to feel so welcome. The local sights were shown to us on a map and even a phone was provided to us for the duration of our stay in case we got ourselves lost in the maze of streets, so that one of the staff would come and find us..amazing! When one day we weren't sure which way to go to leave the inner city, the hotel provided someone to show us the way and put us in the right direction! Nothing was too much for them. The room was out of this;5
We came to universal studios for the weekend. The hotel is clean. Our room was spacious and clean. The staff was friendly. The breakfast delicious. And we can walk to universal studios. Would definitely like to come back!;5
From check in to check out...great service. Had a room on the 19th floor. The room was large with comfortable beds, clean and nice. Very quiet (even the A/C). Convenient location to Universal Studios. Shuttle service was very reliable. We checked in late (11pm) and was not a problem. Also had to leave our bags with the hotel until 7pm upon check out and they were very accommodating. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you Hilton staff!;5
I travel for business all  throughout North America, I spend nearly every night in a hotel. I've seen just about everything, and the vast majority of properties have at least one or two things that need improvement. This is one of the exceptions. Of course the location is great, it's clean, the food is great, etc. But the STAFF are the big surprise. I was there for a whole week, and by the time I left, I had made a point to start taking down their names, for the specific purpose of calling them out here: Ezra the bartender was a classic pro bartender, smooth, fast, friendly, perfectly suited for his job. The same goes for Jose, my server each morning at breakfast. Lightning-fast, attentive, and super-friendly. And the restaurant host, Kester, was wonderful, explaining all the;5
This is easily the top hotel that I have ever stayed in in terms of customer service and charming atmosphere. Before we arrrived, I sent countless emails that they responded to with promptly. They gave us excellent suggestions and tips on everything from dining to gardens to tours. They will guide you, make reservations, book cabs, help you if you get lost via the phone they lend you, bring you drinks and sweets and basically cater to every need.  We are coming to the end of our weeklong stay and can say that while we are nice people, we have put their service to the test, sometimes, changing our plans and taking a lot of their time constructing our schedule. They have stayed cheerful and upbeat. The hospitality is second to none. We enjoy the atmosphere and quiet of the;5
"The staff are friendly and cordial. The cleanliness and beauty of the hotel is the perfect place to enjoy a vacations. The panoramic view from the window was breathtaking. The food was great food, especially on weekends when there was a sea food buffet--unbelievable how much variety and plentiful of sea food; like a cornucopia. We enjoy the walking distance to Universal Studios. We were amazed with this hotel and we plan to stay again in the future.";5
The rooms are  quiet, modern, clean, with wonderful spa dermatology toiletries.  The rooms are not overly scented which I love having allergies.Got in late went to the bar and had a glass or two of Tolosa Pinot and a good spicy chicken sandwich, my friend had a Chicken pasta which was delicious. Next morning I had the breakfast sandwich which you could share in the main restaurant.  Off to the airport on their shuttle.Everyone was very friendly and helpful . A great experience.  Will come back next time I am at LAX.;5
The staff was outstanding.  In particular Jeff was very helpful in all areas.   The best shower I have ever had hands down in any hotel.  I want one of those shower heads!  The room was nicely decorated and roomy.  The room darkening shades kept the room pitch black.  The beds and pillows were fabulous.  I only stayed one night but I wish I could have stayed much longer.  So happy with this hotel.  Highly recommend.  5 Stars!;5
Pil helped us out awesome guy great costumer service treated us right. Great amenities pool was awesome and clean. The room was great and awesome price. Will for sure come back. There are some really nice restaurant nearby.;5
Nice place to stay for an extended layover at LAX, we had an easy check in and checkout, itâs very close to the airport and itâs a clean and very friendly place with good food.  Itâs very easy to get to Santa Monica and Venice also if you rent a car.  Iâd recommend to anyone who is staying near LAX.;5
We stayed here as a last minute necessity and I was thrilled by how accommodating the staff were. I had my two dogs my son, my father in law and everything was last minute.  They up graded my father in law just to be nice and didn't ask any questions about the dogs.  I would absolutely stay here again.  Plus we found a great deal on hotels tonight.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker March 18-22, 2021. The hotel was lovely and everything we hoped for, but the amazing customer service will definitely bring us back again.  We booked this hotel and used a special promotion that they were offering. When we received the confirmation it did not include the promotion. We then called the hotel and spoke with Naida. She assured us that it would be honored.  Upon check out we noticed again that the promotion was not included. Once again Naida stepped up and assured us that she would take care of this matter. It ook multiple phone calls and emails back and forth as she gathered information, but she never gave up until she was able to solve our issue.  We travel frequently and she was one of the most kind and helpful people we have ever met.;5
Flew in to Newark and got the train to Penn station which is 2 mins from the new yorker hotel, Checked in by Mohammed who gave us a room  on the 30th floor which has just been renovated, we knew this as when the lifts opened up on the other floors the carpets or flooring had not been changed and the corridors looked a little tired cheers mate, the room was clean and had a great view, there was only 3 of us in it, that was ok but any more and it would have been a squeeze. Staff were happy to deal with you and checking your door card before u can use the lifts is a great idea, their are also plenty of lifts so u never wait more than a minute or 2. New York is right on the door and the location was brilliant.;5
Famita, Thank you so much for your kind and courteousness checking us in and changing our room. We had a much better stay than initially would have been. The two beds were perfect!  We have stayed here at the empire before and really love it.;5
Our NY Suite was adequate in housing 6 of us who were there for the Westminster Dog show including our show dog. Special thanks to Kelvin Diaz for accommodating our entire group of handlers and dogs on the same floor. Kudos to the entire staff for being extremely helpful and prompt whenever called upon. We'll be back again next year.;5
Excellent hotel, just a walk from Penn Station, Tick Tock Diner inside had great service and food, amazing viewes and totally reasonable rates! The New Yorker couldn't get better!! Central location, fantastic accommodating staff.;5
The location is great with easy access to universal studios and close to a metro stop.  The bed was so comfortable, I didn't want to ever leave it.  The pool was not that spectacular, but had great hours.  The poor woman in the coffee shop has a bald co-worker who needs to learn about being a team player and customer service, but she kept her cool!  The overall staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Overall, this is a top pick!;5
We had a gray time at the Hollywood hotel. Pil is the best front desk agent he helped us and made us feel like we belonged. The rooms are clean the hotel is welcomIng to all essential workers and we love him.;5
The Empire is in a fantastic location in NY, right across from Lincoln Center and Fordham University, and the interiors are stylish and well-appointed.  The pool deck bar, open to all guests, is also special.  It's true that if you are looking for a large pool up there you will be disappointed, but most of us were very happy with the great views of NY and sunsets with gin and tonics.  The staff was also professional and friendly.  All in all: it is not the most luxurious hotel in NY--stay at the Four Seasons for $700+ a night if you want that--but it is fun and terrifically located.;5
Best Hotel we have stayed in the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  Hotel room overlooked Universal Studios (19th floor).  No noise at night not like other hotels we have stayed in.  Secure underground self car parking available which was so easy to use we just swiped our door card.  Cleaniness was excellent and the location was just 5 minutes walk away from City Walk with loads of shops to entertain the teenagers and Universal Studios.  Warner Bros was only 10 minutes in the car.  I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone, and we will be back!!!!;5
The service from the staff at this Riad is the best we've ever had. From setting up guides to confirming reservations and making sure we were happy, it made our vacation smooth sailing! We were thankful for their offer to walk us to locations where we would have gotten lost, and all though we didnt end up using the hotel cell phone they provided ( to call them if we got lost and needed help) it was a nice security blanket to have in my pursue. The breakfast and lunch we had here were delicious and the Hamman and massage were excellent. Decor is an oasis of peace, for which pictures do not do justice. We did a lot of online research before choosing this location and it was everything we hoped for and more.;5
My wife and I visited NYC to see the Macy's Flower Show. We chose the New Yorker because of its location. When we arrived at noon, our room was ready. The hotel staff at registration was friendly and organized. The cleaning staff was friendly. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The elevators worked quickly and efficiently. We were able to get a cab quickly. We plan to stay at the New Yorker again when we visit NYC.;5
My niece and I stayed at this darling hotel after a long day at Universal Studios. They were very accommodating with late check-in. Our room was beautiful and very nicely decorated. Breakfast was included and was both delicious and hearty. Omelette made to order, Belgium waffles, pastries, several cereal choices, yogurt, etc. We enjoyed our stay very much. I would suggest earplugs for light sleepers though. The wood floors make noises louder.;5
The Hollywood hotel in LA is in a great position to see all there is in this fantastic place. The rooms were very big and comfortable, well appointed, though they did lack a kettle (A coffee maker is not appropriate for making tea!). All the fixtures and fittings were in great order and I couldn't complain about anything.   When we first got to the room the fridge did not work, but when we got back after an evening out, it was sorted - big tick there.  The breakfast was nice, with a good choice, though the area was not quite big enough - we never had to wait for a table but a couple of times it was close. The toasters also needed to be replaced - there was always a queue to use the machines which were working.  My only real gripe was being charged a connection fee of $1.09 for;5
My wife and I like this hotel because it is one block form Penn Station, thereâs a Metro entrance at one corner of the hotel. You can walk to most any Broadway show. The staff is very courteous. There are 3 restaurants on the premises. A 24 hr restaurant and 2 others.;5
Che I in was a little slow as it was s busy, but to be fair we had arrived 2 hours early. Staff were patient and polite despite being beer pressure to check a many in. The lobby was very impressive and staff helpful friendly and polite throughout the hotel. Our room was clean and always made up beautifully every morning. Itâs location was superb for everything we wanted to visit, especially for our fist night concert at Maddison Square Gardens.;5
Fantastic stop in the heart of London, the executive rooms where large spacious and airy.  Beds where comfortable and the nespresso was a great touch especially being a coffee drinker. Breakfast was good with a small menu but was hot and flavourful.  Parking is limited, so I would advise travelling via train or taxi as everything is a stones throw away;5
Beautiful New York hotel with great views from beautiful rooms. Already booked for this Christmas COVID depending of course   Close to Maddison Square Gardens and a few blocks from time square   Lovely food outlets just steps outside the hotel. Macyâs also just steps away.;5
Thank you for the upgrade to a corner room!  It was much appreciated by my husband and myself.  At our age, having a larger bathroom was very helpful. See you next year, same time for the Croquet tournament in Central Park. Dr. Russell and Susan Dilley;5
For the last few years, we have been staying at the New Yorker every time we visit Manhattan. It has great value and comfortable accommodations in a convenient location (Pen Station and multiple subway lines nearby).;5
My husband and I spent 5 nights at Riad Kheirredine. Although the start to our trip was rocky due to lost luggage for two days, we couldn't have been happier with where we were staying. The Riad worked tirelessly to find our luggage, and washed our clothes everyday so we would have clean clothes to wear.   When we first arrived, we were greeted by Sarah (who is just lovely!) and she gave us a run down of the Riad and all of the services offered. We took advantage of the complimentary breakfast each morning (enough food to fill you up for the whole day!), as well as the 24/7 Moroccan mint tea to your room. We stayed in Poivre and loved it. The rooftop pool was right outside of our room, and it often felt like we had a private pool. The terrace on the top of the Riad is just;5
Wish there was a way to rate Riad Khirredine even higher!  From the time I made the booking, to the final departure, Riad Khirredine exceeded all of my expectations and made me feel at home.  Elena warmly reached out to me prior to my arrival seeing how she could be of assistance. We had been traveling for many hours so it was a relief once we arrive in the calm, clean , beautiful Riad. We were given tea and fruit and given a tour of the property. Every detail was absolutely beautiful and taken care of.  In our 3 night stay, we were made to feel very welcome and at home. The entire staff was extremely friendly and constantly went above and beyond. The breakfast was delicious and served right to our room! We were given a cell phone to use if we were out and needed to be picked;5
Check in was awesome -  Mohammed took really good care to see that we got the best room with a wonderful view.  And he really delivered !!   Accomodations and the hotel restaurant were 5-star !!!  I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again !!!;5
excellent hotel perfect service rooms comfortable did not like first room and we were upgraded to double queen room no extra charge cannot praise front desk staff ,manager or concierge team enough would definitely recommend this hotel;5
For the past ten years, I've taken 40 to 96 high school students and chaperones on a three day/three night trip to NYC and have stayed every year at the Ameritania.  The people, facility, location, and value increase every year! Every person stops what they are doing and provides the highest level of customer service whenever anyone on my trip needs assistance!  As one example, Jeff and his team help us easily off load/ and load the luggage of two charter buses and make it disappear in a safe room until we are ready to check in.  The front desk team is always prepared and ready for our arrival. The recently renovated rooms are large compared with other hotels in New York City and are beautiful!  The convenience of having the major midtown attractions within short walking;5
Our entire experience at the Empire was excellent. The service, everyoneâs attitude and personality from Dennis at the front door, to the security elevator man, and especially Mackenzie(front desk)! Mackenzie was so kind from the time we checked in and all little questions and inquiries we had. She was the top of the town as was our entire experience at the Empire! Thank you! Weâll be back!;5
We are just coming to the end of a 5 night stay at the Riad and can confirm all the excellent reviews. The staff are marvellous especially Elena who shows genuine interest and concern. The Riad offers a much needed haven of tranquillity after spending any time in the crazy streets of Marrakech. Flat shoes are essential because of the cobbled alleys.;5
Booked the wyndam hotel for my birthday stay in feb 2019.. it was amazing..   the room had everything we wanted including a mini fridge and a lounge, (we stayed in room 4001). There was a fitness centre and a hotel lobby that can be used for your duration of your stay there.   Easy access to Times Square, Empire State Building, Maddison square gardens, and penn street station. (Amazing location)  All of the staff are very friendly and very helpful.  Tick tock diner.. also very good value for money :)  Would definitely stay again at this hotel when visiting NYC again..  Thank you Wyndham :);5
Wonderful place to stay! Nadie and staff were very accommodating with my medical situation and ensured I had all my needs met! Nadie even went over and beyond to make sure I knew of all the food spots that offered discounts as this chick never likes to pay full price if I donât have too!;5
Me and my grandmother stayed 12 nights at The Hollywood Hotel. It was our first time In America. I was dubious about staying here because of the previous reviews. However our stay was fantastic! Our room was clean, and cleaned everyday. We had dry towels and bed made everyday. Beds were very comfy, but a but squeaky, room was good size. our room was facing the car pack, which was quiet.  The breakfast was ok for the first couple of days, but after this it got boring. There was a selection of foods available, but for an English person, the food was different and there wasn't a large selection. Egg was the main choice, but after having this every morning for 3 days it got too much and needed something different. Drinks were brilliant, lots of choice, and nice fresh orange and;5
We stayed in this riad for four days and we absolutely feel in love with the place and it's fantastic staff.  The riad was beautiful and the staff catered to our every need including going above and beyond especially with all the extra's! Breakfast every morning on the terrace was a real treat and always served around our schedule, which was nice since we were on holiday after all! The summer promotion kept on getting better as I didn't realize it included so much for the price! Every night we came back exhausted and it was nice to just relax and chill on the terrace before dinner. We opted for dinner in the Riad for the first night and the traditional Moroccan dishes were excellently prepared and very delicious.Our final night we decided to eat in as they also have an Italian;5
We stayed 5 nights here in October/November. The service from the staff was always polite and helpful especially Pil on the front desk. He checked u s in after a long flight , arranged food delivery and tours for us and was the best looking Penguin on Halloween. The rooms and bathrooms are a bit dated but very clean and were serviced daily. Free wifi is also included. Renovations are ongoing in the hallways with decoration and painting so it can only improve. Breakfast included daily in the restaurant was amazing. A choice of eggs and waffles cooked to order and a great variety of other items all served with a smile. The location was good with easy access to public transport. I would definitely stay here again.;5
before coming to this hotel we read many reviews and was expecting the worst... when we got there we were shown to our rooms and to our surprise they was not atall bad. Our bedroom is the double room shown in the pictures. it is very spacious, In this room there were no cockroaches or any bug of any sort, However there were stains on the bed sheets but this was one thing we had to overlook. The television worked and was to a good standard. One major issue was whenever we went to open the door or touch anything we were bound to get an electric shock. The bedroom was very hot and the windows were taped up but this wasnt too bad as when we were there it snowed.;5
We were travelling around the States for 4 weeks looking at universities for my friends PhD. New york was a sight seeing trip and our 5 nights there were made much easier by the fact of the location and accessibility. We got takeaways right to the door after nights out it was all round a great hotel would go back!!;5
In my experience, this Hotel is the great place for me. The Room is always clean. The breakfast is good and always fresh. Internet is great. And the Receptionists are reall friendly and helpful, especially the three of them namely... Pil, Gisel and Nicole. Thanks for them we had a great fun staying at the hollywood hotel.;5
The hotel was great, friendly staff, comfortable bed, clean rooms and modern and clean bathroom!  We left the hotel at 7am each morning and had breakfast in a little deli 2 blocks away and returned to the hotel to go to sleep, I wouldn't have wanted anymore than we had and would have been gutted if I had paid anymore for a plusher hotel for the amount of time we spend inside it! New York has so much to offer and there isn't enough time to do everything, you certainly don't want to be wasting time stuck in a hotel.  The room (on the 5th floor) was cleaned every day, fresh towels were provided daily and if we had any queries about where to go and how to get there the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful.  The reception area is a little run down and dated and it has a;5
My daughter and I were going to the Kelly and Michael Show and wanted to be close to the event. We found the closest hotel which was the Empire.  The hotel was beautiful.  The front desk was very welcoming upon our arrival.  The beds were very comfortable.;5
I have never written a review, but I thought this hotel was just great for going to Universal Studios and touring Hollywood. A nice surprise. I wish it were located next to Disneyland. The free shuttle was right there when we needed it, and it saved us the parking fee at Universal We had a beautiful panoramic view, and the hotel food was good too. We also saw a Disney celebrity on our floor.;5
I chose this riad for its beautiful, traditional vibe and architechture and I wasn't disappointed. The entire riad is very beautiful, clean and well-kept. Lots of green plants makes it a nice oasis in chaotic Marrakech. The rooftop terrace is awesome, and there are a lot of different seating/lounge areas that gives you good privacy. The staff is super friendly and ensures that your holiday will be as smooth and memorable as possible.  I would definitely recommend this riad to my family and friends!;5
We stayed 4 nights recently! Room is basic but itâs all ya need itâs very clean and central to many attractions :) hairdryer is good also! staff are so nice and helpful. I would stay again! Only thing is 4/6 lifts to the 20th floor werenât working so everyone who was on the first 19 floors had to wait for two lifts which were crowded so if they were fixed would be so much easier! But great stay.;5
Lovely hotel. Decided on upgrade to two bathrooms, very reasonable. This hotel has style all of her own. Defiantly in the right place, all locations to visit so nearby. Definitely stay here again, soon hopefully.;5
A friend and I spent 14 nights at The Jane, and whilst our room was absolutely tiny (we had a bunk cabin), I couldn't have been happier with The Jane. The hotel is clean, the service is attentive and friendly and in terms of location you really can't get much better. All of this for an extremely reasonable price.   I will definitely be recommending The Jane to any of my friends who travel to NYC, and will most certainly be staying there on my next visit.;5
Location is perfect. Broadway directly in front of the door. Times Square 5 min. away by foot. Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center are both reachable by foot within 10 min. and you get a great impression of Manhattan on your way to them.  I booked through a online holiday portal and booked a room for 2 adults (me & my brother) but it turned out it was a one with a single bed. However, the hotel staff (here Rob) was very attentive and arranged another room with two separate beds at no additional cost.  The doormen are also very attentive, most of them are multilingual (I heard at least French and Spanish apart from English). They have great tips for having lunch or dinner etc.;5
The rooms are renovated recently and are very spacious. Breakfast facility has been upgraded. The member of staff Cecil and Gisel have been amazing, polite and helpful at all times.   I competely recommend this place if you are wanting to stay around Hollywood and all the famous attractions in LA.;5
Daughter needed a get a way date with mom so NYC sounded perfect.  I picked the Amtrak and she picked the hotel.  Who knew we were going to get a deal through Amtrak.  best location across from Penn Station.  We got there early and spoke with Mohamed on check in.  No issue with the early check in and moved to a room with twins instead of queen which was only option on line at no additional cost.  Mohamed was so very helpful with suggestions on dinning, shows, and sites.  Room was great with size that was amazing for the price.  Thank you walk in shower after two days of sight seeing.  I used guest services for show ticket options and they recommended the greatest Sunday brunch.  Will definitely be returning and recommending.;5
Spent 3 nights in this beautiful Riad where the staff anticipated your every need. Your holiday experience is golden when you meet great people and the staff become ways to connect to the local culture at this Riad. You just have to stay here and you will love it all form the great food to the very caring staff and great rooms.;5
The location of this hotel can't be beaten specially when you've had a long day at the studios.  The staff try so hard to make sure your stay is a pleasant one.  Even in winter the spa outside was lovely;5
Best riad anywhere.  They looked after everything.  From mint tea whenever requested, a phone given in case you need assistance while touring to great recommendations.  The restaurant is fabulous.  Finally, we had a 6 AM departure flight.  Not only did they have a team to assist at 3:30 AM, but delivered coffee to my room at 3 AM and provided a breakfast bag for the trip.  Will never stay anyplace else in Marrakech!;5
First impressions are so very important to the customer experience, and Anthony at The Empire's front desk did not disappoint. A beautiful room on the 9th floor with views of The Lincoln Center and more, the cozy chic lobby bar and beautiful oversized rooftop bar, and a staff that made me feel a part of the family every time I walked in or out of the door. And Anthony was always around to check up on my stay--greeting me when he'd see me coming through the lobby to make sure my stay was perfect. Thank you, Empire. I'll be back soon.;5
It really is only a stone's throw from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. The front desk service was excellent, everything was well prepared and ready for us for our late evening arrival. Loved the room with the views and layout (room 3020) The Tick-Tock dining associated is a disappointment though, see separate review.;5
The staff is extremely nice and most of them have a great sense of humor. As with most Hiltons, the rooms are spacious and super comfortable. Even though the place was busy, undergoing construction, and hosting a convention, there was adequate parking and minimal noise. If you're planning a visit to Universal Studios, this is the perfect location to stay.;5
This hotel was very good the quality was great the customer service I received was great looking to go back. The food was great and delicious. would recommend anyone that likes to stay in hotels that's the place to be;5
We stayed at the Ameritania after a recommendation from my parents who see plays often. What a great find! The hotel is modern and beautiful. Tiffany at the front desk was not only lovely in person, but was a big help before our trip even started! There was a restaurant we were having trouble getting into because of our large party and Tiffany handled the reservation for us and also communicated with my sister via email to confirm all details. We are already planning our next stay at this wonderful hotel!;5
The front desk staff is always so helpful in making sure the room is right! They treat you very well.  The house keeping staff do a wonderful job and never forget anything. I've Stayed at the New Yorker, the Marriott Marquee, the Old Helmsly Palace and others and will tell you that you will not find a better hotel- The New Yorker gets top rating from me.;5
The hotel was lovely and all the staff were very friendly. The hotel bar is lovely and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. When we first arrived Nick at the front desk couldn't be more helpful, he enhanced our whole trip with brilliant recommendations and fantastic service. A very friendly and good looking man, it's worth a visit just to see him and his team, Gunita and Jose!!;5
In addition to being well located, the hotel went under renovation only three years ago and is very clean and fresh. The staff is very helpful. The hotel has a nice location near the theater district but yet is quiet for sleeping.;5
Back against and just as good. Great location and always welcoming. Clean, comfortable and well maintained. Just far enough away from the noise of Time Sq but an easy stroll to the park, 5th Ave and museums.  Very happy with my second stay;5
My first time in Los Angeles and I have to say my stay was great. Me and my family were greated all the time staff from the hotel would see us. Not to say the breakfast is a plus is not just your ordinary breakfast with coffee and bread. We got to do a few tours around the city which was great got to see many different things. Veronica at the from desk was very helpful with me and my wife in getting directions and maps to all the locations we wanted to go. I will defently come back with my family and stay in this hotel.;5
Extremely convenient if you are attending a peformance at Lincoln Center (Met Opera).  I give the 15 out of 10 for the reservation process.  The staff were great.  Nice clean, recently remodeled hotel in central location.;5
After a year of Covid, my family greatly needed a vacation. So we decided to go to Universal Studios and stayed at the Universal City Hilton. I was a bit worried, but after meeting and speaking with Kevin, the Director of Front Office Operation, I was sold. I can't begin to tell you what a diamond-level treatment and stay we had at their establishment. Kevin Finster was awesome and his professionalism and pure love of servicing his client were exemplary! The views and cleanliness of the rooms we had were up to our expectations. Our contacts with his staff were also professional and exemplary. I will continue to stay there in the near future!;5
We stayed at the RK for 4 nights and cannot recommend it highly enough! The riad, rooms, people, service, food and spa are amazing. Everyone knows you by your name and it feels like coming home every time you return from a dinner/excursion/walk. The people are really incredible, from the bellboys to the reception and spa staff, to the waiters and maids - they are all professional, polite and warm. A big thank you to everyone who made our stay unforgettable, we look forward to returning!;5
"Location, food and facilites all perfect.  Room: Spacious and grand. Bathroom excellent although toilet cistern kept overflowing. Minbar concept interesting with ""lock and key / plastic seal"" security - their housekeeping staff are either bad people or they have a high shrinkage problem.  Restaurant: words cannot describe how excellent the buffet is. Seafood and any othe type of food in abundance. Wine list good (we had kendall jackson chardonay which was great) and the staff were excellent.  Highlight: Frank Barry the piano player - talk to him - he has a great LA history to share and is a respectable guy. Make sure you tip him heaps!  Location: Universal Studios next door - what more can I say?  Value: Outstanding and great fo families.  Internet: Pay to use and average price.";5
I love this location the most Iâve also previously stayed at the Elantra in Vegas but  every year for our anniversary we come back to this one because itâs our favorite. Location, staff, overall vibe is always great;5
We enjoyed one night at this hÃ´tel for the first Time.  ++ great location Great employÃ©e ++++ a cot for our baby If i come back to London i will sleep in a premier inn hotel i think because that was great;5
We took a nice couples get away to the hollywoodhotel which has been long needed. We stayed in the Jacuzzi suit and it was worth the price and privacy. Thank you Pil for the great room we couldnt have had a nicer time. You truly have a good spirit sir. We Will see everyone soon.;5
Great price for the area. Everyone was kind and fast with their service. Hugo can make a wonderful omelette with fresh cut vegetables. The Hollywood sign can be seen out the front door as well! Plus it's far enough away from the main tourist streets for a peaceful night sleep.;5
The New Yorker hotel is in the best location ever! About a 6 minute walk to Penn Station and pretty much in the middle of everything - Central Park is about 30 minutes walk away.   The lobby area was lovely and was home to a lot of Virgin crew! The staff at the hotel were friendly and we were explained the local taxes and everything we needed to know about the hotel. Very nice as a lot of hotels fail to tell you about this until the end!   Our room was on the 20th floor and was slightly on the small side, but for the amount of time we spent in the room that really wasnât a problem. The room was spotless, bed was really comfy and shower was powerful. What more could you ask?  We had an issue with the WiFi during our trip but after chatting with the lobby staff, they were very;5
Thank you to everyone at the hotel for a memorable stay. EVERYONE we came in contact with from the person at the desk to the doorman helping us get a cab (in the rain) to the friendly room attendant who smiled and said hello in the hallway we felt very welcomed. A special thank you to the people behind the scenes who were responsible for staging our room for an extra special 15th Anniversary surprise. THANK YOU NEW YORKER TEAM!!;5
We visited the Empire during December of 2012 for the Holiday season in NYC.  Upon arrival you will see a beautifully decorated lobby and bar area.  The staff is very efficient and gets you settled in quickly.  The rooms have the same decor as the public areas.  When we returned back at night, there was a delicious cupcake with the Empire logo in our room. We both had a wonderful nights sleep, the beds and pillows are to die for!  I truly appreciated the bath products they provide in their rooms. L'Occitane products are high quality and smell great! We had a nice corner suite that provided some great views of the upper west side and the Lincoln Center. This boutique hotel is in a great location whether you plan on going to the Lincoln Center or not. It's so close to Central;5
If you want to stay in the old town of Marrakech, this hotel should be your top pick. They really simplified the entire Marrakech experience for us in a city which can be quite hectic. The hotel is a sanctuary and a great base for exploration of the city.  Room: Nicely decorated rooms. Hotel's inner courtyard and rooftop balcony are great. Location: Nestled in the old town of Marrakech, you can walk past locals going about their day. Service: The service here is 6/5. The team at the front desk and the rest of the staff really provide a level of personalized service that surpasses any hotel I've ever stayed in - more notes on service below. Amenities: A lot of amenities in a small package. Having their big customized breakfast spread on the rooftop is a great experience.   More;5
"A perfect hotel in the center ! The staff is very nice (special thanks to Jerry for the upgrade room and free wifi ;) Rooms are big and quiet. The hotel is very nice and comfortable One of the best hotel I've done in NYC";5
The Hollywood hotel is a prime location with many stores around the hotel. Gustavo at the front desk was extremely helpful and kind. He directed me towards the pool with a smile behind his mask and gave a very nice room. Definitely recommend this hotel.;5
A perfect stay, our room was immaculate and very comfortable. A perfect location too just 5 minutes from Times Square.  The staff were so helpful, especially Jeff who sorted our taxi to JFK much appreciated.  Thank you all at Ameritania Hotel.;5
My husband & I visited NY at the end of February & stayed at this hotel. It was fantastic! Rooms cleaned daily, staff always helpful & friendly and the lobby always clean & tidy. The hotel is ideally located within walking distance of a lot of tourist attractions such as the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square & Macyâs. We had a wonderful time at The New Yorker Hotel. Would thoroughly recommend.;5
I was worried we would hear planes all night, but despite being on the airport side of the building, we couldn't hear anything from outside. Our primary disappointment was that the pool was offline during our visit, and my two kids were pretty devastated by that. I really appreciated the ease and check in with the app, and the quick responsiveness to a phone call to the front desk when we needed a plunger. I also really liked that we could walk from the airport to the hotel with our luggage without problem.;5
Just back from 4 nights in the Wyndham New Yorker and we could only praise every single aspect! We told Driss on check-in that it was my first visit to New York, and he worked hard to find us a room with a view - of the Empire State Building on the 31st floor. Our 2-bed room was extremely clean and comfortable. Not huge, but still plenty of space for two. The bathroom was small but adequate, and although the hot/cold mixer shower was erratic you have to remember the age of this hotel. I viewed the tired look of the bathroom as part of its heritage - if you want modern chain hotel looks and facilities, book a modern chain hotel. Our free Wi-Fi was perfect throughout. We mistakenly left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door one day and inside 10 minutes of our return that evening;5
This Hilton location is beautiful. The hotel rooms were very nice, clean and quiet. Staff was friendly and helpful and made our stay very pleasant. I would highly recommend this location. It is also right across the street from Universal theme park, so we were able to walk (no parking fees at the park).;5
My experience started off by being greeted at reception by a charming man named Mr Ze. His friendliness and cooperation perfectly sums up the attitude of the Hotel. He deserves a raise! I would absolutely recommend it.;5
Stayed for 4 days 1St Sept 4th Sept  We stayed in deluxe king-sized and room was exactly what it was a deluxed king-size staff were really helpful and hotel was really clean I would definitely stay there again location on Broadway was perfect and close to subway highly recommend;5
"The lobby, interior courtyard, large breakfast room, and guest rooms are elegantly furnished.  Bed had a very comfortable firmness and the room was quiet.  The shower had plenty of water pressure; it was a shower only, no tub.  It appeared that every room had a balcony or a patio.  The central courtyard is very pretty, an enjoyable place to hang out - my room's patio opened onto the interior courtyard.  There is a small but adequate exercise room.  The included breakfast was supported by two chefs to prepare individual egg dishes, plus a wide variety of fruit and bread items.  The pool area is very pretty, reminding me of pool scenes in old movies.  A very good value for a reasonable price.";5
I stayed at The Jane for 10 days. For the price you pay in NYC, it was actually pretty good. Rooms are clean, always tidy at the end of the day, clean toilets and always available for use. The service was very good, friendly staff (including a Portuguese-speaking) and available. The room is small but ideal for 1 or 2 people, should go more than that, better to book the captain's cabin. As I was on the 5th floor, I was not bothered by noise or nennhum insect. At check out there UJM problem in recovery, but that was promptly resolved by the responsible person at the reception. Almost every day there some kind of exclusive party, but the noise does not reach the fifth floor, so ask for an upper chamber and the window does not stay on the road side, you are not a beautiful view of;5
The Hotel was lovely and the Staff extremely helpful , we felt very safe with the security staff doing a excellent job. The room was small but adequate and clean and bed was very comfortable.   Would definitely return but would upgrade to a slightly bigger room with a view. Thanks for making our trip enjoyable ð the location was amazing too.;5
We had a great vacation here in marrakesh. The riad is charming aswell as the staff. Specially Salimi hassan that showed us the best parts of Moroccos, Best worker in this riad for sure. Best experience ever;5
We have stayed at the Empire  many times over the past 6 years  and have always been entirely satisfied. The hotel's website (including the photos)  accurately reflect what you can expect.  The staff is friendly and very helpful. The lobby bar is a wonderful place to sit and have a drink or coffee and chat with friends at anytime of the day.  Location is  very convenient -  across the road from Lincoln Centre and a short walking distance to the American Museum of Natural History, Broadway and Time Square, Central Park,  and many really nice reasonably priced restaurants  in the Upper West Side.  There's a subway stop right outside the door.;5
From before we arrived to leaving the service was fantastic. Room really clean and tidy as was the full hotel.  I contacted the hotel before traveling as wanted to make sure the booking was all in place and from there the customer service I received could not have been any better. When we arrived it was really busy and had a short wait but the staff was very friendly and polite.  The hotel is in a great location for seeing all of new York. We walked everywhere and seen loads. If I was to go back I would book this hotel again.;5
Loved the location across from the MET , and the convenience to the restaurant downstairs Clark's and their own restaurant, the Chowder House upstairs for breakfast and eve snacks.  Empire front desk runs efficiently, staff excellent and our room was available early when we arrived by 1 from Phila.  Even gave us free internet.  We stay there often when we come in for our overnighters to NY.;5
Spending 90+ days at the Universal Hilton this year, I can highly recommend this hotel.  Bar none, this is the friendliest staff ever assembled.  I will be returning next year for a similar stay, and already look forward to that occasion.;5
We found the hotel clean, staff friendly, rooms clean, all bedding & towels white. Coffee & tea making facilities. The hotel was the quietest that we have found to date in London.  Next to the London Eye, across the bridge from the Strand. Taxiâs very often available from outside the eye, or use the hotel telephone to book directly with a taxi with fixed fee! Throughly enjoyable, we will return.;5
Our stay was brief but we were pleasantly surprised to find the Hyatt Regency LA hotel to have nice rooms that were well insulated from the airport noise as well as, the food was pretty good.  It was slightly expensive but we enjoyed it.  The hotel has transportation from the airport and it is roughly a 10 to 15 minute ride.  They say you can walk but I would not.  It is far and if you do not know where you are going then take the hotel transportation, especially returning to the airport.  The airport is very large.  I appreciated the conference hall we held our meeting which was well equipped and worked well.  The bed was comfortable and the room environment was good.;5
Perfect place to stay if going to universal. Easy walk to park.  Decent pool, ( plus you  donât have to walk through lobby to go to pool) Christian was so friendly and helpful  with check in.  Restaurant choices was ok, buffet was amazing, with many choices. Only complaint was one morning had cold shower.... when complained on checkout response was â oh yes we were having problems with thatâ....... some type of compensation would of been nice.;5
Hyatt Regency is always inviting. The rooms are clean, airy and roomy. The staff is welcoming. It's always home. The hotel shuttle to and from the airport is easy to get. The nights are restful and tranquil.;5
Elena from the Moroccan riad called me directly in the United States of America two minutes after I booked a trip to Morocco with the first three nights at Riad Kheirredine a day before our trip. Elena asked me if we needed airport transportation to the riad. Wow! I was already impressed with her exceptional hospitality. We booked the airport transportation to the riad and Elena perfectly managed all the details to make our welcome safe and secure. Elena also offered a special treat reservation of a romantic Moroccan dinner for the first night. Upon our arrival to the Riad Kheirredine, Sara, a role model of hospitality, welcomed us with refreshing Moroccan lemonade and complimentary dried  Mediterranean fruits. Sara gave us an introductory welcome briefing about the riad and;5
I was here for a business meeting and found the property very well kept.  The room was lovely, the gym was well stocked, and the staff was very accomodating.  The hotel shuttle was fast, free, and readily available.  This is right by the airport, so no other services in immediate walking distance, but as a spot for a meeting or time before travel, it's a great find.;5
Eventhough our trip coincided with Sandy!!!!!, we thought the hotel was of excellent standard.  The staff were extremely courteous and always ready to help.  The men on the front door were always ready to help with directions and calling us a taxi.  Rooms were great, although we had to be moved from our original room because the door wouldn't lock, other than this we have no complaints.  We were stuck in the hotel during the hurricane and the hotel made sure we were served breakfast, lunch and dinner during the monday when the storm hit and breakfast the following morning.    Would certainly recommend this hotel..   They were very friendly towards our 2 year old son also, always coming to speak to him and acknowledging him.;5
Dena made sure I was comfortable throughout my stay at The Hollywood Hotel. She even offered restaurant recommendations for me and my friends. My room was quiet with all the amenities I needed for my trip. The location was great for sightseeing at the Griffith Observatory and easy access to the freeway. I will definitely come back.;5
Great location and close to time square and subway. About 3 min walk to subway and 10 min walk to time square. Room was clean and comfortable. They Held our bags after checking out which helped so we could explore NYC before leaving! Also our room was available early when we checked in.;5
I stayed for one night to attend a concert at MSG. So easy to navigate to and from that venue.  The staff was amazing.  Prior to my stay I had to call and the front desk staff was great. I asked to check in early and they accommodated me no problem. Mohamed took great care of me when I needed a roll away bed.  Overall I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting the city. I will again.;5
I stayed here for a week, because I had Hilton points, and my son and his wife had had a baby and live nearby. I had no preconceived ideas, and was not interested in the theme park. What a fabulous surprise. The people were SO  nice and helpful. We were even able to rent a car from nearby and leave it for the rental people to pick up. The continental breakfast was great. The room was great. I don't know LA very well, but it seems to be located very centrally. I'll for sure go back.;5
I stayed here during the Christmas Holidays, I know a little late to review but I really wanted to say what a great experience I had at the hotel. Check in was efficient and easy, the room wasn't quite ready so they stored our bags. I loved the history and character of the rooms and lobby and the hotel itself was in a fantastic location to explore Manhattan.;5
When I found out that I had to change hotel I was not happy but I was happy that I had the pleasure to meet Naida who is a front desk representative who went above and beyond to make us frontliners feel at home away from home. Thank you so much Naida for all you do.;5
I stayed at the Astor on the Park 3 times this year, it's small but very clean, great customer service! I love that the park is right across from the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to everyone, for a great price you are getting great service! I will be taking my kids in 2 weeks.;5
Very nice and clean hotel with large rooms. Very focused on guest safety as you need a room key to show to get from lobby to elevators for guests.  Very attentive to guest satisfaction and even had someone knock on the door to ask how the service was. Two restaurants are off the lobby( not owned by the hotel) one is Italian and the other a Diner with excellent food and is very convenient. I've stayed in NYC many times and wish I had stayed here those times. Just one block from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station in one direction and Macy's in the other direction. This is my NYC hotel choice for all future trips;5
Stayed here for a 2 day 50 th wedding anniversary. The hotel gave us an excellent room overlooking Madison square garden. They also provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine. The hotel staff and management were very attentive and efficient. The location was very good and we were able to walk to all attractions. If we come to New York again we will stay here again The hotel has a lot of history with celebs and politicians staying there. Go on the elevator to the basement to get the very interesting history of the hotel.u;5
After spending hours perusing through riads on Trip Advisor, I booked Riad Kheirredine for our honeymoon. We could not have been happier with this riad for our first trip to Marrakech. The staff was incredibly accommodating and responsive from my very first email to them. Upin our arrival, we had the most delicious snack and friendly welcome, and throughout our stay, the staff was so friendly- we have never experienced such hospitality in any place we have ever stayed. They anticipated our needs before we knew them- scheduling dinner for our first night in, helping us with directions, picking us up in the Medina when we got lost, and making us as comfortable as possible. We stayed in the Rose room and got some of the best sleep of our lives- the room was clean, cozy, and;5
We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights 25-30 October and it was absolutely superb! Check in was straight forward and easy. The lobby was beautiful and everywhere looked fresh and clean. Our room was perfect! Massive in size with 2 double beds, but the most amazing part was the view! We could see the entrance of Universal Studios and the Harry Potter Castle. Only a straightforward 10 minute walk to the park. The pool and jacuzzi was also clean and inviting with towels provided by the hotel. I would 100% recommend this hotel and hope to return myself again soon.;5
Very nice property and wonderful staff. Clean, quiet room and nice amenities.  Pool is very nice and offers cabanas and other activities. Shuttle between the hotel and CityWalk is a nice bonus, although you can also walk there.;5
Came here with my new wife for part 1 of our honeymoon. Will definitely be back again.  Read alot of reviews about the state of the rooms. Now this is an old iconic building with alot of history, but the rooms are clean and the security is well manned. The location of this hotel is smack bang in the middle of everything, which to me is the mosy important aspect of being in NYC. If your holiday is defined by tiredness of the room then you're not getting out enough!  We arrived at 16:05 expecting our room to be ready as check in is 16:00, but we had a small wait. This was fine as the young gentleman on reception gave us vouchers for complimentary drinks in the bar.  Staff are very helpful in reception, but do your research if your travelling somewhere. There is a travel advisor on;5
At the Hollywood hotel you always feel welcomed. And at the front desk you can always find Pil. Seems like he is there all the time which is wonderful. In these tough times being welcomed with smile and encouragement is a blessing. THANK YOU Hollywood Hotel;5
Riad Kherridine is a hidden gem and the best place to stay in all of marrakech.   We were given the warmest of welcomes with a mint tea and figs with apricots as we checked in. Amazingly you get a free mobile phone that you can take with you during your stay - handy for maps and we even booked a dinner using the WhatsApp whilst we were out and about.  Everyone who works there is kind and friendly - thank you! The front desk, table service, cleaners, laundry staff (with free laundry everyday), bar staff and the guys who walk you to and from the taxis are all great people.   The meals are really good too. We had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs and one on the roof which has great views and lots of space. The breakfast is wonderful with two courses and lots of orange juice;5
I had reserved a room and it was nice.  Problem was that night, I found out the tv wasn't working so the next day, I alerted the front desk.  Within minutes, there was someone in my room and then two people trying to fix it.  When they determined it was unfixable, they spoke to the manager and he called immediately and offered me another room that was larger and nicer than the one I reserved.  Majid was the manager's name and Sedik also helped out to get me into the new room as effortlessly as possible.  I will stay here again as the staff was excellent and the location is also great for the affordable price.;5
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel this week for three days. Since I am from the South I expected high prices and rude people. The hotel, its food and amenities were pricey compared to things in the South which was fine; however, their staff was SUPERB! Everyone took the time to explain how to get places and where the cool spots were. Their conversation was genuine and they made my trip a breeze. Special shout outs go to... Simon - front desk Nick -  night mgr Jose - front door guy Syed - room service attendant  Thank you thank you Thank you!";5
My wife and I spent six days at the very beginning of February at the Riad Kheirredine with our grown-up daughter. Both of our suites were spacious: we had a sitting area with a magnificent fireplace in one bay of our bedroom, with separate bathroom and hall while our daughter had a sitting room, bedroom and bathroom. The Riad is built around three courtyards and our rooms looked out over the largest of the three, with a pool and orange trees. There is a second courtyard with large palms around which the restaurant is arranged, which has a beautiful mosaic fountain at one end. It also has a fireplace in which a blazing log fire provided some welcome warmth on our first night but as the week progressed the weather warmed up significantly and we enjoyed another excellent dinner on;5
spacious rooms. great staff and management. Universal City Walk is walking distance. There is also a shuttle service to/from City Walk/Universal Studios. centrally located for visiting other LA tourist attractions. Highly recommend this hotel.;5
Love this hotel! The service was great! They texted me to make sure we were still checking in since our flight was delayed! The room is clean and spacious. Love the continental breakfast and if you are willing to pay the extra $10, you can experience the full breakfast experience which included Chinese noodle soup. The mattress and pillows are really comfy. It only took us 10 min to walk to universal studio. It was great we spent all day at universal studio and was able to go back to the hotel to take a break and take a nap to recharge after a day in the Southern California blazing sun! We will definitely be back for the next trip to Universal Studio!;5
The hotel being a Hyatt brand maintained its class. It had a huge rather mammoth swimming pool where it was not easy to swim alone. It needed almost a thousand people to look occupied :-) Nice ambience and great breakfast. Service was good the valet guys expect tips but its not compulsory;5
This Hotel is literally a short walk across the street from Penn Station..Off the train from Boston and minutes to our room.. Literally minutes from Times Square,St  Pats Cathedral to namer a few. Numerous restaurants in the area as well..;5
We spend three nights at this hotel on our recent road trip. Check in was swift and efficient, complimentary wifi offered.  Room well appointed and spacious, beds comfortable and bedding of a high quality.  Great location for universal and also downtown LA, concierge offered great advice and we had a great day using the metro on our own tour of the city!  Tickets for universal purchased from the hotel, and free shuttle bus offered which was great after a long day.  We did not eat at the hotel but we did use the bar and coffee bar which were excellent.  Pool is fantastic too! Loved this hotel!;5
My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights in a metro view room on the 32nd floor. We had a great view of the Empire State Building. The room was clean and well furnished. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and functional, despite the 1920's plumbing. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. One gentleman even ran after us as my daughter left her phone in the room. The Tick Tock diner is good, but a little pricey for what you get. McDonalds and Starbucks are right across the street. The location is great and the hotel offered good value. The business centre and wifi were particularly good. We didn't use the fitness centre, but it looked well equipped. Loved the museum area. I would definitely use this hotel again.;5
As usual spotlessly keen Well located , great value for London Well run and we always return , about to book again for next trip Never any queues for the communal facilities as plenty of them Corridors washed every morning ! Outside sitting area too;5
What a wonderful place!! Never got such an extraordinary service in a lovely Riad with wonderful, individual  rooms: we will come back!!  WeÂ´ve got a lot of support to organize our stay in this wonderful city, .;5
We loved this hotel.  Nice views, large rooms.  Wish they had a microwave and refrigerator in them.  That would have made them perfect.  It is a couple of blocks from Universal Studios, but they have a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes.  We bought front of the line tickets and considering the crowds, it was well worth it.  We had a great time.;5
Just spent a week in what was probably the most interesting hotel I have ever visited. Yes, the room was small but they tell you that up front. Yes, the bathrooms are shared for some of the rooms but they disclose that, also. And, said bathrooms were always spotless - seldom was there even anyone else in the bathroom even though the hotel appeared to be full of guests.  The beds were very comfortable and I had two rooms (checked out for a night due to a visit to another city then returned to The Jane for several more nights) one in the back and one facing the street and both were quiet. Even under the beds the rooms were both immaculately clean.  To top it all off the staff from the front desk to housekeeping personnel were all very friendly and went out of their way to be;5
Great over all experience! Perfect for Universal travelers. As an annual pass holder to Universal Studios there is no where else I would stay. The room was great (we opted for Executive King). The view was amazing and great size!;5
We stayed at Hollywood Hotel  two times while we had a sick relative in hospital near by The rooms were very comfortable and clean.we were able to walk to hospital, thus saving parking fee. The front des staff, especially Daniel were aware of the nature of our visit and treated us with compassion.;5
This is the place to stay if you are visiting Hollywood. First class hotel with excellent accommodation and walking distance to Universal City. Traffic in Los Angeles can be troublesome so that the location of this hotel makes it convenient for the Hollywood area.;5
Location Location Location!  This was a great place to stay!  I was on the 18th floor. It was nice, modern, quiet, friendly staff.  Helpful concierge with knowledge of many dining option.  Parking is pricey!  I wish I would have stayed longer.;5
Staff friendly and helpful. Thanks so much for letting us in our room so early. We flew in from Australia (long flight) and arrived at 7.30am and we were greated by the most friendly girl (sorry I am bad at remembering names) who made sure we could get into and room and settled. Most enjoyable stay. So close to City Walk... Universal  Universal looked great from the high floor and the Christmas lights;5
The only hotel to stay in if you are here for childrenâs hospital. Absolutely the friendliest staff ever. And again came and pleased fo chat with Pil again. This guy is amazing period.   The hotel is the greatest from the luxurious rooms ( 242 ) to the amazing breakfast. The pool is so spacious and clean. I could just keep going on and on.   Great hotel highly recommended, will be back anytime we have a hospital visit.;5
Incredible customer service. The front desk made sure that the birthday weekend was acknowledged, and made very special for me and my family. Thank you to Roxanne and Noah and abby for everything! â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸  Room upgrade to excellent view and food was delicious!;5
Lovely hotel for the price.  Perfect location and staff was friendly and accommodating.  Would stay here again if given the opportunity.  Loved the decor.  Room was a tad small but I assume most places in NY are...;5
I was a little concerned over the Hollywood location only because of previous reviews I read on the hotel.  What an unexpected surprise. The location is just fine.  We even brought our little old dog who had to go outside a couple of times during the night and I felt just fine.  It is a very public street and well lit.  If you have a pet, there is a $30 charge they don't advertise.  The parking was gated and very nice, but does cost $25, so the additional charges brings the room rate up to comparable hotels listed in area searches.  Our room was very nice, ground floor with view of the courtyard..  The bed was wonderful and  appreciated the tile floors over old carpet. There is a pool off to the side of the hotel and of course, then there is the breakfast that everyone posted a;5
We stayed for six nights and enjoyed every minute of the trip. The entire staff were very helpful and attentive to our every need. The team has a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes to and from Universal Studios. If you feel like walking it's a quick five minute walk to the front entrance. Extremely well thought out connected design of the overall physical layout of the grounds. They provide a nice coffee pot which uses the small round coffee pods. Their pool is nice and well kept. They have an adequately equipped gym that is provided for your use. Their cafe Sierra was a nice surprise. They are a bit pricy however, you can't beat the convenience of location and full menu at your disposal. If you wish you can sit in the bar and order from the cafe menu. There is also a charge of;5
After getting delayed at the airport, we checked in at 2am and the staff were most helpful and caring for our tired children, they took us quickly to a lovely room on the 26th floor with a view over the Hudson.  The room was spacious for New York with two very comfortable double beds and a small but nice bathroom in art deco style.  Super location close to everything in midtown. Macy's around the corner, Madison Square Garden opposite. Great breakfast everyday in Tick Tock diner. Had nice cocktails in the lobby bar.;5
Have stayed hers before, was due again this month.  Due to the virus we cannot travel and have had to defer the holiday until next year 2021..  We are lucky that we have a member of staff who is caring and understanding!  Her name is Neida Aldama!  What a brilliant person who has helped us all the way with our cancellation and rebooking a new holiday!  There has been a small charge in line with the cancellation criteria but I am sure we will not lose out with this Lady looking after us!  I want to thank her and all the staff who have helped us !  Well done the New Yorker!;5
We have stayed at this hotel several times. The staff are always very friendly and very helpful. Its in a great location just by the London Eye, 20 min walk to Covent Garden area. Will definitely come back.;5
People make the difference in life especially when traveling. I have been staying in NYC for years, and I would recommend the Empire to anyone who believes like I do that the staff make a hotel stay most enjoyable. Gabriel took care of our reservation with Hotel Manager Kevin who was incredibly responsive and made us feel welcome. They added a touch of hospitality by having a fruit plate and water available as we arrived late in the evening. Rudy checked us in with a smile and put us in a suite...a great sized room for New York City! We can't thank the Empire Team enough. We will be back !!!!;5
We had 3 great nights at the Hilton overlooking universal studios. We asked for a high floor room and overlooking the theme park, and we got one of two, the high floor was excellent and we had views across LA. No need to worry about theme park views.  The facilities were amazing, the pool, room, staff, gym, restaurants, coffee shop, concierge and free regular transfers to universal studios / city walk were brilliant. The hotel staff were excellent, especially the concierge (male) who gave us simply excellent advice on how to make the best day out of universal studios, we ended up buying the entry tickets from him and followed his advice, it worked a treat.  The casual restaurant had a happy hour with cheap drinks and platters, well worth a night there.;5
This place is a gem.  An absolute gem.  The ambiance of this road is fantastic.  We stayed in the lotus suite.  Great room.  Beautifully decorated.  The staff is very attentive.  Their priority is great service, and they achieve it.  At any time of day, they can be reached and will accommodate whatever request you have.    They give you a cellphone.  So if you're outside sightseeing and you need something or you're lost, you can call them and they'll either explain how to get back or send a taxi for you.  They have a contract with one of the local taxi companies which will transport you for a flat rate.    The food in the Riad is great.  They will give you Moroccan tea and biscuits/pastries at any time for free.  We had it in from of the fireplace.  They had food waiting for us;5
We just spent a week here and found it fantastic, the room was very clean and modern, and the staff are all super friendly and attentive,  a special mention to Jeff the concierge, if you need help with anything, jeffs THE man   See you again next year.;5
"This hotel is totally awesome! We were pleasantly surprised particularly in light of some of the ""not so great reviews"". Because we travel a lot, we know that reviews can be skewed depending on the person and their experiences. We are glad that we gave Empire a chance. The room was great (we stayed in a king jr. suite to get the view). We were not disappointed and the roof top restaurant/bar/pool areas were very relaxing with wonderful views (and they stay open late). Additionally, the staff was very accommodating. We will be booking this same hotel today to visit our son in law school in September.";5
I spent a very good stay at Empire hotel. The location was good, next subway station. The staff is very kind with smile. Our room was wonderful and very clean. I felt like at home. I recommend this hotel in NYC to enjoy your vacation or something else.;5
The Empire Hotel is pretty Central and close to Central Park. Fair price. Near station 59st Columbus Station and Times Square. You can use public transportation or taxi (there is a stand in front of). When I return to Manhattan I want to stay here again.;5
Overall hotel was excellent ideally situated staff all very help especially Nouri and Jalal. The only downside was the noise of the air-conditioning coming on all hours of the night sleep very disrupted. Double glazing might also help with the the street noise.;5
Myself, my mother and my sister stayed here for five nights at start of April. We had the deluxe double room with two double beds.  Pros:  -all staff were very helpful, friendly and polite. Nothing was too much or too little for them.  -Hotel is within short walking distance to Broadway/Times Square/Central Park. We like to walk so was perfect for walking to alot of other places too. -Rooms were spacious. I was expecting to be totally cramped with two other adults in room but nope. -Rooms were clean/modern design. Serviced daily. -Beds were soooo soft...could have stayed in them all day only there were things to do and see :) -Shower was warm and strong. Bathroom clean with toiletries provided. -Loads of channels on the TV. -Kept our luggage after check-out -Free WiFi.;5
First visit to Marrakesh and split the time between 3 nights here and 5 in an all inclusive resort outside the city walls.  From the minute we arrived at the Riad we were made to feel like house guests and shown real hospitality. It was the little touches that made the difference. Being sat down on arrival and brought tea while Yajaira told us about the Riad and the city. The guide who took us from the Riad to the start of the market area, the mobile phone to  ensure we would always find our way back. Being taken to Maison Arabe for a Cookery course rather than just being given directions. Having breakfast set up wherever we wanted to eat it and being asked what else they could cook for us other than the basic (scrumptious) Morrocan conserves and pastries that were the standard;5
I've been to NYC multiple times and the New Yorker is the only hotel I'd stay at.  The rates are reasonable for NYC and the accomodations are great! If you want a quick snack or drink, or want to enjoy a great meal, it's all right here!;5
"Traveled here with my dog in tow and chose this hotel for the great location and ""pet friendly"" status. The room was clean, comfortable and well appointed. There was a fridge and a microwave in my room. I didn't visit the pool but the courtyard is a magical little oasis in the bustle of the city. There are tons of places to get amazing, authentic, ethnic food within walking distance. The parking fee is reasonable for the city and in a gated lot off of Vermont Ave. As noted by others, the breakfast offerings were fresh, abundant and delicious! Nicole at the front desk was absolutely lovely in offering assistance when I locked myself out of my room. The staff was friendly and accommodating to me and my furry friend. I would absolutely stay here again!";5
I had to leave my existing hotel as it didn't meet standards, and the Hyatt was recommended by a colleague.  I was greeted by wonderful refreshing staff who made all facets of my stay an exceptional experience.;5
We had a great time, the location was brilliant, 6 minute easy walk to the main entrance with a foot bridge over the roadway and the staff were super helpful. Other attractions easy Uber ride away. We will be back.;5
We booked this riad after reading the good reviews on trip advisor and the reviews are absolutely correct, this is a fantastic place to stay.  The staff are excellent and nothing is too much trouble for them. This is a relaxing and welcoming riad that I would highly recommend.  When we arrived, we had booked dinner which was a four course meal of delicious morroccon food, the breakfast is very good too. Tea,coffee, water, fruit and fresh juices are available to guests at any time.  Valentina and her colleague arranged for us to visit a hamman that they use themselves and it was relaxing and reasonably priced. We stayed for two nights in the amber room which was beautifully decorated and comfortable. The mobile phone that was provided to us was very useful as we did get lost a;5
The Hollywood hotel was a really nice stay. Jose R. At the front desk was polite, extremely helpful, and made our stay that much better. There is gated and secure parking. I recommend this place if you are looking to stay in the area.;5
after one week in this hotel i can say :  - nice hotel - very clean - staff is nice - the localisation - the roof top and the view - you can have nice food in the buffet of the restaurant  you ll like it for sure;5
We travel from Nevada to Los Angeles for medical care for my child. We ALWAYS stay at the Hollywood Hotel. The rooms are always clean, and itâs quiet. It has the cutest courtyard, where weâve eaten delivered pizza several times. The gated parking makes us feel safe, as well as requiring a card swipe to enter the hotel. We have only stayed on the first floor, but while adventuring around, we learned you can only access the floor youâre on, another great safety feature.   Itâs about a quarter mile to CHLA, so we walk instead of deal with the hassle of hospital parking. The front desk is always friendly. My little guy asks âare we going to see Dena?!?â every time he knows we are heading that way.  Hopefully one day the restaurant portion will re-open and we can enjoy everything the;5
I chose this hotel for new years because it was close to the ball drop. well, i still didnt get to see it up close because they block it anyways and you need to be there early to be able to get a good view. The hotel it self is located in a perfect place, close to central park, rockefeller plaza, broadway, time square, and all the major attractions. All within walking distance. the customer service is the best I have experience in a while. I left my souveniers in the hotel's transfer to the airport and didnt realize it until I got home. I contacted them about it and they were very helpful and were able to ship my souveniers back home. they were very delligently and responded to emails with in minutes. totally recommend this hotel! the rooms are small but so are all the ones in;5
Oh my the review below made me feel protective of The Jane! I stayed in September, and it hadn't occured to me to write a review until I saw that review. The Jane is a truely wonderful place! My experiences in New York were fleeting, but I stayed with a friend in The Jane for 1 night, and we loved it so much that we returned for another night. The rooms are tiny, which is the point of the place (and the price, obviously) but beautifully decorated and fitted out with Ipod/IPhone dock, TVs at the end of your bed, robes, etc etc, all you can need. The shared bathrooms are so clean and well kept, and there are enough on each floor that we never had to wait, or felt that we had to rush. The staff are unbelievable - fitted out so handsome, helpful with bags and directions, gracious of;5
everything about this place is amazing, me and my wife had a great time and we will defiantly come back soon. rooms were nice, stuff was friendly and always smiling. everybody were so nice, and they took really good care of us;5
We were glad to see when we arrived that serious protocols were in place to ensure the safety of guests. No need to touch the revolving door, it is motion sensitive. Your body temperature is taken as you enter by a camera monitoring system which is attended to by a hotel employee. Hand sanitizer is readily available all over the hotel lobby and floors. Spacing protocols are also enforced, even in the elevators. The room was clean and inviting. Plastic coverings on the remotes, as well as sanitary wipes on nightstands and tables. The front desk was kind enough to provide us with a late check out! We would surely stay here again.;5
Great clean hotel with a good fresh breakfast. The pool area is nice and quiet even though their is a busy road nearby.The staff is very professional and welcoming.Especially Pil in the reception. Anna from Sweden;5
From the moment we booked we were extremely impressed, the staff at Riad Kheirredine were so helpful, reliable and friendly,  the Riad was absolutely stunning in every way and the food was incredible.  We canât wait to return and will recommend to all our friends and family.;5
Family lives up the street Los Feliz area. The Hollywood Hotel is a short walk south. Great staff members, Nelson always makes us feel welcome. Knows all us by name. Cleaning crew very accommodating with room toiletries and such.;5
I just wanted to stay close to the airport for an early flight but I was delighted by the service of the wonderful people who made me feel welcome and comfortable. Israel the bellman gave me all the information I needed to get quickly oriented. The person I checked in with was warm and helpful. I strongly recommend this place so you will feel welcomed with a great location;5
Hilton Universal is what a hotel should be.  Consistent quality and service.  Staff was very professional and friendly.  In the past, we have stayed at other hotel that is located nearby and it did not match, at all, the quality of the Hilton Universal.  You will not be disappointed.;5
Great service, front desk was very helpful. PIL was great, answered all questions and made our stay fantastic! Definitely would recommend this hotel for anything family  fun staycation! Hollywood hotel is the best!;5
The Astor will be one of your best choices for new York city . Always well located , it is  funny to chat with the staff  they are always ready to help and on top they new new York very well attraction wise party wise. Good  restaurants and the CafÃ© are well located some minutes with the underground or exploring by feet you  will enjoy the hotel.   Special thanks to Hanul;5
My daughter and I traveled from Atlanta for a long mother's day weekend. We were there for four nights. We had a great experience with Empire Hotel.  The concierge went way beyond what concierges usually do. They were able to get VIP tickets for Live with Kelly and Michael for us. They were so helpful and we found all of the staff extremely nice. The location is the best with it being right across Lincoln Center and close to Central Park.  I would definitely stay again.;5
Staff is helpful, friendly, and knowledgable. Couldn't ask for a better experience there. Also your facilities are in top notch condition. Room was super, and the Regency Club was quite clean and well-stocked;5
Firstly there is little point putting up any personal photos as The Jane website is so good and totally representative of what you will find there.  I got to stay in a bunk room with a companion and then a single room by myself.  The decor is beautiful and the rooms and communal bathrooms so nice that it balances out the lack of space.  If travelling with a partner pack as lightly as you can to make the most of the space. The single cabin has a space under the bed for your suitcase so best to put what you may need straight into one of the drawers and then store the rest away for your trip. The staff were fantastic and are a really great asset so I hope that the management appreciate them.  If you want to feel like you're in an Agatha Christie then this is the hotel for you, it;5
Absolutely loved this hotel and defo wonât stay anywhere else when in New York  Was checked in by Driss on reception who looked after our every need whilst we was there in fact all staff from the doorman to the cleaners were fantastic  Remember tho this is a old hotel with character so if your looking for up to date stuff this maybe isnât for you in fact it reminded me of staying in the Empire State Building which was built around the same time  Our room was 3615 and the view was amazing we could lay in bed and see the Empire State Building all lit up at night plus we could see madison Square Garden  Room was fresh and clean we heard very little noise from other rooms guests etc  Lifts were very quick and no waiting like some people have said on here  Tick tock diner is great;5
I stayed at The Jane for 3 nights,it was my first time in New York and I found the hotel to be Clean well run and they are happy to help you with any problems. This hotel would be my first port of call when I return to New York.;5
Luxurious Hilton hotel - very easy, fun, walk to Universal or use hotel shuttle.  Let's just say eating the breakfast buffet that locals no doubt take advantage of, might be the highlight of your stay. Location perfect - Makes you feel like you are staying right in the Universal park.  As a diamond honors member, I can tell you this is one of Hilton's best.     hint.......I think if you sign up as a hilton member you might get the breakfast buffet free.  That $35 buffet that you will not likely forget. $18 self park auto.;5
The staff were incredibly helpful & friendly: nothing was too much trouble. They provided us with a pre-programmed mobile phone for emergencies (e.g. getting lost!) as well as a guide to take & collect us from the local square - very useful, since the Medina is a labyrinth to the uninitiated! Our room was positively luxurious, with fresh fruit & free bottled water always available. We appreciated being able to eat either on the roof-top terrace or in the cool of the courtyard - and the breakfast was excellent. I would warmly recommend this riad to anyone seeking to enjoy the local culture.;5
Have stayed at The Empire dozens of times (all for business) over the past few years. Favorite hotel in New York. Just spent weekend at Empire with wife and young daughter. Great location (running in Central Park). Great staff (valet remembers my name every time). Great value. Have convinced friends to cancel Plaza reservations and stay at Empire they have had no regrets. Always happy when I am at the Empire.;5
This was a short weekend trip with my wife.  Everyone/departments (front desk, valet, restaurant, bar, and housekeeping) we came in contact with were excellent. The Hyatt Regency LA, just like it's name indicated is very close to the airport and rental car return.;5
We stayed at this hotel while our family traveled to universal studies for summer vacation. This hotel far exceeded my expectations and was far closer to universal studios than I ever imagined. Hotel staff was perfection!;5
For the price, I was not expecting a luxury hotel. I am happy to say I was wrong! Everything about the Ameritania was very impressive, from the room to the service and the helpfulness of the doorman Jeff! Would definitely stay here again.;5
Highly recommend this hotel. I donât often write reviews, but when I do itâs to celebrate a real find. Our exceptional experience here was due to the outstanding staff. From the moment we arrived, I felt welcomed and appreciated. Lovely Maggi at the front desk is the epitome of graciousness. You knew right away you were in the good hands of someone who really cared about you and making you feel comfortable. Her natural elegance elevated the check-in experience. I also enjoyed the humor and courtesy of Chris at the front desk that morning. We came in after a red-eye which can be a grind. The professionalism and personal touch of each member of the staff helped start my stay in New York off right. Eugene at the front door was the personification of hospitality. He continued to be;5
My friend and I checked into the hotel for a 2 night stay for a nearby event. The hotel is in pristine condition and is in excellent location. We were able to walk everywhere that we needed, including MSG, the Javits Center, and numerous restaurants.  Additionally, we were immediately next to a 24 hour diner, a movie theater, and the Hammerstein. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Muhammad who provided us with EXCELLENT customer service. As individuals who work in the customer service industry, we were extremely impressed with his professionalism and the quality of his assistance. He provided us with a great customer experience and we will definitely return because of it. Our room was great - clean, nice view, spacious. Everything we could have asked for. Thank you!!;5
I've stayed at the Empire over a handful of times and never been disappointed. The spa is amazing and I literally had the best massage of my life there. The rooms are divine and quiet which is sometimes not an assurance when you stay in a city hotel. Finally the location is ideal to get anywhere you want in the city.;5
Just leaving after a lovely 4 day stay.  4 adults beautiful hotel, very pleasant staff to welcome you,  upgraded us on arrival to a huge family room 2 bathrooms, beautiful clean, great maid service daily  Ideal for empire state building and times square.  Starbucks over the room and Mc donalds all on the door step.  My only comment would be $5 Per bag to leave your case on departure day also a $300 dollar security deposit for room.  We definitely will return thank you New Yorker;5
I have travelled all around the world but never found such a gem. The place is clean, nice and lovely. A special thanks to Sara and the director, who gave us very good suggestions for dinner. Sara and one of the waiter organized a shisha smoke for my husband. Book here and you will have the best time of your life;5
Stay in this riad kheirredine for a week . It is a very peaceful place to stay .We were well looked after by the friendly staff .The food was very nice as well.We are very enjoyed the views from the terrace.;5
Wonderful experience staying at this gem of a hotel.  Great service, location is super - the park in April is awesome and so close.  Doormen were super helpful and friendly and rooftop lounge a delight.;5
Wonderful hotel in midtown, great for Macy's and quick ten minute walk uptown to Times Square or Empire State Building five mins away. Krystal was so kind to me as I was travelling alone with my two year old infant, she organised a room in a refurbished room for me as I was worried about infant allergies and old carpet etc. What a beautiful hotel with great amenities and staff. The New Yorker truly made my week travelling in New York with a baby a breeze- I can't say enough thank you's and especially to Krystal on the front desk, she is so professional and kind, we felt very looked after. Will be back to the Wyndham.;5
My experience at the Empire Hotel was absolutely IMPECCABLE. Pasquale checked me in, and from the moment I arrived, he truly treated me and my best friend like family. He made sure we were happy with our room, and took care of every detail regarding our stay. Him and Kathleen at the front desk were welcoming, kind, and made me feel like they really cared about us having a good stay. Every time Pasquale saw us, he greeted me and my friend by our first names, and asked if there was anything else we needed. This is not the kind of service most NYC hotels of this caliber offer - usually a lot of staff at fancy hotels like this are snobby and stuck up - but not Pasquale. He was friendly and paid attention to every detail, including specifics of what type of room we wanted, and even;5
Just spent four nights at this hotel and it is a gem. Ideally situated on west 34th and 8th we had a room facing straight down 34th to the Empire States Building. From the 21st floor what a view !!  Given the week was very very cold it was great to come back to a warm room, the cleaning was daily and spotless and all of the staff were polite and efficient.  One word of warning beware the ' resort' fees banged on your card on check in;5
This hotel is just a few blocks from almost anything and everything you need in Manhattan.  Great location for Madison Square Garden, Times square, The Empire State Building or any shopping you want to do.  Rooms are not large, but the view made up for it in my case.  Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Definitely worth a look if you are looking to stay in NYC.  I had issues staying connected to their Wi-Fi but that is not really why I stayed there.;5
My husband & I were celebrating our anniversary at the Hilton Universal City Hotel. We requested an estandby add-on for executive floor upgrade/w/breakfast.  At the Hilton Hotel, I spoke with a wonderful women name Linda who then spoke to Roxanna (mgr) to see if we can be upgraded. Our request was granted for the add-on. Linda was very personable & well spoken. She also helped us with late checkout (our plane was delayed), bottle water, & hotel information. Rooms are very clean & hotel shuttle goes to universal Studios was a big plus. We will be returning next year. Thank you!;5
Hotel has such a history and even though a little dated, it's fun to realize the stories it witnessed. Mohammed was great at the front desk on check-in and the restaurant staff, especially Salvador, were awesome. It was just a quick overnight visit for an appointment, but they made it feel special!!!;5
There was a mix up with our room charge.  Neida, who is an employee in the billing department, quickly and with professional knowlege corrected the issue.  The hotel was comfortable, centrally located and was close to the things we wanted to see.  The metro station was a block away.;5
My kids and I took a trip to LA in June 2012. Being from the east coast, we really had no idea where to stay, what to see etc. Thanks to the online reviews we had a fantastic vacation! This hilton was very clean, great location and friendly staff. I was so happy we stayed in this area instead of in Hollywood. Price was much cheaper and area was much safer. Just a few min drive on the highway had us in the middle of all the action!;5
What a great hotel  , staff very friendly and helpful especially Danny in charge of Bell services  ,a great person  always very helpful and nothing to much trouble for him , would definitely stay there again;5
a classic.  warm and fuzzy, new-york style.  tick tock diner is wonderful also <3  great rates, perfect location for any garment center professional, among others :)  love the authentic touches that remain.;5
Just came back from a terrific stay at the Universal Hilton over the Memorial weekend.  You canât get a better location than the Hilton if youâre visiting the Universal Studio.  The room was good size, comfy bed, clean and no problems with noise.  The view of Studio City, Hollywood Hills and part of the lower lot of Universal Studio (we can see the Transformer building) were fantastic (room 2259).  Everyone at the hotel was super friendly and always ready to help.  If you didnât need the help, they would just shower you with their smile and greeting which will just brighten your day.  Here are some random details about the hotel: 1.	 Parking was $20/day for Self-parking.  We didnât see the need for valet since we only stayed for two nights and didnât leaving the hotel at all;5
We go to the Metropolitan Opera a few times a year and always stay at the Empire. Excellent value for the location, always clean and the staff is always very helpful and welcoming. We donât see a reason to stay anywhere else.;5
Firstly, I'd like to say we're in our late 20's early 30's newly married and were on a budget and love exploring.   Astor on the park is a 3 star hotel. Bad reviews on here are laughable - you get what you pay for.   It's clean. The maid service has to be one of the best I have come across, fresh towels bed sheets and great toiletries they can't do enough for you they work like they are in a 5 star!   It's loud, noisy, from hustle and bustle outside and you can hear the subway a little, ambulances and fire trucks are stupidly loud but that's at no fault to the Astor. You would get that at the Hilton - it can't be helped   The rooms are cosy, you can hear your neighbours, the bathroom is the best with a great shower. The staff are good, give good info and help. We were in room;5
Friendly staff. Fresh water in the hotel lobby was very refreshing. Easy access to subway and walking distance to Central Park, many museums. Times Square was only 8 quarters distance. Good restaurants around the hotel.;5
We booked a king alcove room which was on the 19th floor, air con didn't work , Patricia at the front desk changed us to the 22nd floor, no worries and gave us breakfast vouchers. Room is stunning, views are awesome, hotel is great. Only gripe is that wifi is not free.;5
Just spent 4 nights here in this famous hotel. Staff are  always helpful and friendly especially the young chap who checked us in early ( 2 hours) and upgraded us to a better room. Room was always very clean and spotless. Hotel is in a great location with a restaurant attached (Tick -Tock) and close to the Penn station / Subway. Free Wi-Fi in lobby and also in our room. The hotel is not perfect but I'm not one to slate it because maybe the bathroom tiles are slightly different or paint is chipped !!  Would I stay here again ??  Most definitely.;5
Trust me. This place rocks! I'm a young 20-something male who traveled for one night's stay in NY on business last week. I knew I would not be spending most of my time within the hotel, so I wanted a safe, quiet, private, very inexpensive and pleasing stay. More below:  Straight to the cons: IMO, none, really! My only gripe was that the room service to the cafe downstairs (CafÃ© Gitane) did not pick up their phone when I called for room service. I was lazy and did not want to go down myself to get food. Plus, it was Cinco de Mayo that night, so I'm sure they were busy. My loss -- check out their menu and photos here: http://gothamist.com/2010/01/04/cafe_gitane_at_the_jane_hotel_open.php?gallery0Pic=7#gallery  Tons, and tons of pros:  â¢ VERY clean (little dusty here and there tho);5
My daughter and I had an absolutely wonderful experience staying at this hotel. The staff at the front desc, Pasquale and Ze were great. Our room was perfect. The fact that you don't have to drive all over town to get good food also helped a lot, since the Restaurant in-house is excellent! We just could walk across the street to the Met! From now on this will be our only place to stay in the city!;5
My standard queen bed room was so tiny but nice. Really comfortable bed and linens. Very clean. Speedy check-in and check out. Friendly and helpful staff. Great midtown area close to everything. Would definitely recommend. Wi-Fi in rooms should be included in price though.;5
When i am traveling to and from LAX i prefer to stay at this hotel. The staff is the reason i keep coming back from the moment i check to the time i leave. The restaurant and bar area is casual but sophisicated. If you get a chance to workout there the workout room is second to none and a great view of the airport. If you are lucky enough to make into the Regency Club please see Cairo , what a gem he is, he is so accommodating to his guests and the food is pretty good, Overall a very nice hotel that I will always be my first choice near Lax;5
I stayed here in February for my mums 60th birthday. The hotel was very accommodating and upgraded us to a better room which had views of the empire state building. They also gave us some complimentary bottles of wine and breakfast vouchers as this room was not available the first evening. The hotel staff could not do enough for us and also placed some birthday banners that I brought with me in the room so that my mum had a nice surprise when we returned to the room. This hotel is clean and an excellent location for the different sites. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I visited New York again!!;5
Finally caught Hamilton in NY and wanted a place close by but also near the park.  Great location to get to both.  Lobby always had security.  Staff friendly and accessible.  First night it was a tad noisy but hey it's NY.  Hotel supplies ear plugs!;5
Nice hotel, provides all that is needed for guest. Breakfast which is above a standard continental breakfast. Small gym but suitable for several guest. Pool is very well kept tho to cold to swim in during the winter.   Rooms are quite spacious, specially for a solo traveler. Cleaning ladies are very nice and polite. Free Starbucks coffee which was a pleasant surprise.  Staff is friendly and helpful. Pil went above the call of duty for me, so big thanks Pil.  Very surprised with my stay with affordable prices. Kindly recommended to all.;5
Perfect location . Very short walk  to Central Park and Times Square . Rooms are very spacious and clean . All of the staff was very nice . Jeff was so helpful with assisting us with luggage and arranging a car to pick us when leaving the hotel . Hotel is located right by  numerous restaurants and shops . We will definitely stay here on our next trip to NYC.;5
We rent out our apartment in the city and moved upstate. When we need to go into the city The Empire is our âgo-toâ hotel and never disappoints! Best location. Great views. Rooms are better value than anywhere else in the City. Impeccable service. Wonât stay anywhere else.;5
My family and I stayed at the riad for 3 nights at the end of Jan 2017  and we absolutely loved everything about this riad. Superb service, spotlessly clean beautiful rooms, delicious breakfasts and dinners, complimentary laundry service,drinks and fruit. Will definitely go back.;5
Friendly and professional staff. Clean and updated rooms. Super location within walking distance of Terminal 1. Even though it is right next to the airport, the rooms are quiet and nicely appointed.  Convenient airport shuttle.;5
This Riad has beautiful decor, comfortable rooms and common areas, great breakfast, excellent service, it's kept spotlessly clean by the wonderful staff, and it's location is quiet enough to keep the atmosphere relaxing but close enough to the main square of the medina to afford you all the opportunities for exploring that you could ever want. The amenities that everyone has raved about - cell phones, escorts, plenty of tea, coffee, fruit and bottled water etc - are all there if you need them. There is no reason to stay anywhere else.  We loved it.;5
I have stayed at The Empire hotel several times and love the place. The staff is very hospitable.  You can check out and still enjoy the pool upstairs while they keep your luggage in their front storage. The  view is beautiful from upstairs, rooms are nice and clean. I will return whenever I am in Manhattan!;5
I just had one of the best surprises of my long travel life.   The New Yorker hotel in New York City. From Check-in to Checkout this hotel rocks for an affordable hotel in Manhattan. Now I wish I got names, but I am bad at this.   The lady at check-in was courtesy and very helpful.  I had two rooms 3012 which is a good-sized Queen Suite and 2249 which is a Family Two Bed suite with Terrace.   Both rooms were spotless and in great condition.   Room 3012 was on the executive floor which was the latest renovated floor.   Room 2249 was not as newly renovated but in wonderful shape.  The bathrooms were appointed well with even extra towels in the closet.   There is no surprise the rooms are spotless.  You could tell the housekeepers on both floors were well experienced and each time;5
We were here on a school group tour. The staff were very professional & extremely nice. The rooms were nice. Shower was very large. We were able to control temperature in room & it actually got cold unlike some other hotels.;5
Having never been to LA before I was struggling to find the best place to stay. Knowing from talking to people that there are nice areas and not so nice areas.  A friend the Universal City Hilton due to its safe feeling environment with plenty to do in the evening without having to travel.  It is right on the doorstep of Universal Studios and Universal City which sits just outside of the Studios and has an abundance of shops and restaurants to keep you occupied. We were here for 4 nights and spent each evening here trying out the different restaurants all of which we thought were really nice. It definitely feels safe however they do stop serving food around 9ish and it does start getting quieter around this time. If you wanted to stay out later than this for drinks we found one;5
"Have stayed twice now.  This time I forgot to put the ""Please Make Up The Room"" sign on the door one day.  They actually called me that night to see if I wanted the room cleaned.  It made me feel like they were looking out for me.  A very nice touch!";5
The level of service was over and beyond the call of duty. Roxanne & Linda are by far the most amazing hotel reps Iâve ever experienced in my years of traveling. The compassion they have for the Hilton Brand is more than what I ever expected. If I could take them with me to every hotel, I would. I would highly recommend this location to my colleagues, family, and friends.;5
Exceeded our expectations , take the airport / hotel transfer. Great views of the Atlas Mountains from the terrace, all the staff were really attentive but not overly so . Food was great ( beer and wine available) the rooms are very individual and spacious try for one near the terrace. Always use the hotel guardian service when returning later at night. Great location in the MÃ©dina very close to souk.;5
Hugo and Sonja were excellent chefs!  Our breakfast was the best that I have had in years!  The fruit was fresh and the juice was fantastic!  We had wonderful fresh omelets and ready upon request eggs of how you wanted them!  They were so friendly and ready to cook upon order!  They were friendly with everyone and making conversation with everyone in line and still able to get our fabulous breakfast made to perfection!;5
Very nice hotel, great value and location! clean and safe! Definitely recommended! For a weekend stay for friends, family and couples! Rooms are comfortable and not very noisy! Few blocks from restaurants and shops!;5
Made me feel at home after a long road trip Pil the front desk guy was so helpful on letting us know the deals he is such a nice guy I was so happy to see some friendly faces he let us know we could relax in the pool and just unwind oh and canât forget about the awesome gym they have canât wait for the morning workout ð¤©ð¤©again thank u so much to Pil heâs awesome;5
Got a great service from Pil! Tidy, big room with two beds, they let me check in early which was a life saver as we just got off the long flight from Tokyo. Gym, sauna and all sorts of good facilities for free. We will come visit here again next time for sure!;5
I I Stay at the New Yorker whenever I come into New York to shop in the Garment District. It is convenient to both the district and to the Amtrak station making it the perfect location. The staff is responsive and caring and the classic architecture is fascinating;5
I loved this trip in particular. The rooms were tiny but the location of the hotel was so convenient. I got to see Madison Square Garden, Times Square and the Empire State Building. While my husband was in his meetings I walked around the city. It was great!  I had lunch n dinner at the Tick Tock CafÃ© and turns out that George Bush used that as a Campaign Headquarters.  I went downstairs and read up on all the great history of this beautiful hotel. There were many historical points of interest. I loved my trip. Looking forward to visiting again in the near future. Hopefully if all goes as planned - we will be visiting again in January 2017.;5
Short trip to NYC with my son and we stayed in the New Yorker. Itâs a bit tired but the process of updating rooms has started so it will be better in time. This said, we had everything we needed.  The location was central. Within walking distance of all we wanted. Our room had 2 queen size beds. We looked down towards the Hudson River. Our bathroom had the best shower ever. Plenty of towels, travel size toiletries and a hairdryer. Coffee and creamer was provided as well. Staff were always pleasant. Itâs a great place to stay.;5
Great lobby, pool, pool bar, gym, high-speed elevator.  We stayed two nights and used the valet quite a bit, with no attitude from staff, nothing but friendliness.  Room was odd-shaped and had some odd holdovers from the 80's, like a corded phone next to the toilet (how was that ever a thing?), but was overall comfortable and well-appointed.;5
Pretty cool hotel itâs bigger inside than it looks outside. The hotel staff is really cool. The guy who checked me in was chill. Got me big room and was very welcoming. Cool stuff tho, the pool is still open for guest only. Must come back and recommend.;5
The hotel is clean and tidy but a little dated.  We always travel with the idea that our hotel room is a place to rest at the end of an action packed day and this hotel provided us with exactly that.  Very quiet at night which is perfect and the block out curtains mean we had a great sleep.  The pool is clean and super inviting after a long day of exploring.  Breakfast can get a little boring after a while, esp if you dont want EGGS again but its a small issue and didnt effect our stay at all.  We also managed to catch the comedy show which was a blast.;5
Of the many hotels at LAX weâve stayed in, this one has done by far the best job renovating one of those typical old airport hotels. We originally were assigned a âCity viewâ (read: parking lot view) only but after asking politely at check in, the front desk guy went out of his way to shuffle rooms around in order to upgrade us to a suite, thanks to our Globalist status with Hyatt. We ended up with a wonderful big suite with perfect runway views which was quite impressive. We found the room to have nice modern decor, a comfortable bed and a rather nice walk-in shower.  The pool is in the midst of parking garages and you actually hear the airplane engines roaring in the background but we strangely liked the pool area regardless and appreciated how deep the pool was (something;5
Got a great deal here 800 for 6 nights tax included. Requested a room with a view and that's what I got. The room was very modern and very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It was very quiet outside at night as this is a residential area. It's a 45 min walk from midtown if you walk briskly and a few blocks from Harlem. Theres lots of cheap eats around along with pharmacies and barbers. The staff were friendly and welcoming and even though the place is basic it's one of the best deals you can get for NY. It's a 15 min subway to midtown and all the tourist attractions. Would stay again.;5
It was an excellent hotel and it was spacious. The room also was spacious and clean. We paid extra paid for queen beds which were comfortable  and  pillows were great . The shampoo or soap had good qualities gave no migraines. Wee decided stay another night.;5
Riad Kheirredine is a model of customer service and a big flag for Italian flair and charm.  We felt totally relaxed, safe and cosseted in this Marrakesh Riad which we would happily recommend to anyone who appreciates the complete but personal service.  Everyone employed played their part perfectly and you know what, we, and other members of our family, will go again;5
Beautiful hotel with quality food - enjoyed every single lavish breakfast with a view of the city on the rooftop. I had nothing short of a wonderful and wholesome experience in Marrakech at at this riad. Definitely recommend those who want some peace, quiet and a different experience away from the typical hustle and bustle in our daily lives.;5
Gave us a great experience in NYC.  Wonderful staff, great facilty, everything you need was there with a reasonably priced room.  Proximity to the Intrepid, Empire State building, Broadway and Time Square was great.;5
Stayed here in conjunction with sports tours international for the 2017 New York City Marathon, rooms are clean and roomy enough, housekeeping are efficient and do a great job, wonderful art decor feeling, would be ruined if refurbished stones throw from lots off main New York attractions great views;5
Having read a few negative comments about this hotel I was a tad concerned about staying here. I'm really not sure what some people expect? I found this hotel great!! From the time we checked in the staff were nothing but helpful. The room was modern clean and very comfortable with all amenities. The free breakfast was lovely there was a great assortment of hot and cold items - the cook to order omelettes and waffles were the best!! Great job all round. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here. Thank you !!!;5
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Empire Hotel. Love the diversity of guests and hearing various languages spoken while riding the elevator or sitting in the lobby. Truly enhances your international experience as you venture out into the city!;5
We stayed at the riad for two nights and had a wonderful stay! Extremely friendly and helpful staff, delicious breakfast served on the roof terrace plus cosy and squeaky clean rooms. We highly recommend this beautiful place to others and would love to return!;5
My brother in law and I stayed here on a 5 day trip to NY in April. If the purpose of your trip is tourism related, please read on. Logistically, the New Yorker is conveniently located a stone's throw away from Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, and several subway stations .The A,C,E trains, 1,2,3 trains, and the LIRR to JFK stop here. The Herald Square station is a 7 minute walk for the N,R,Q,W trains. If you're flying into New York from JFK International airport, the New Yorker is very convenient. Just take the AirTrain to the Jamaica Station and purchase a ticket for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) which takes you into the city near the hotel. Note that the entrance to the New Yorker is on 8th street and NOT 34th street despite the large sign. (If you're taking an Uber or;5
Extraordinary experience Staff and services are excellent. Location ideal to experience the Medina and markets. Also make sure you visit the gardens--Majoralle including the Berber and St. Laurent museum.  I can not praise the service and staff enough. Imagine cappuccino in your room before going to breakfast and a cell phone provided to call for someone to come and collect you when you get lost (and you will get lost). Never had any concerns about security and safty in the street or market.Everyone was courteous and helpful. Put aside whatever stereotypes you have and enjoy!;5
I cannot recommend this hotel enough! I originally booked this hotel for myself and my partner and just booked a standard room etc! Little did I know that my partner contacted the hotel manager to see if he could help make our trip one to remember! The manager upgraded out room which had an amazing view! The beds were ridiculously comfy! The staff could not be more helpful! The chowder house has beautiful food and the decor is just beautiful! My partner also proposed while in NYC! The hotel arranged for a bottle of bubbly and rose petal bed which was just beautiful! I will never forget our first trip to NYC! The empire made it extra special! A big shout out to the door staff who were so welcoming and helped get us taxis when required! Thank you so much to all at The Empire! I;5
We stayed 4 nights here and could not have been happier. Excellent staff, clean comfortable and spacious rooms. I recommend the concierge services especially if visiting Universal Services. Great location, easy parking, and great facilities. Also a special mention for Peets coffee in the foyer. Great coffee, helpful staff and thank you for returning my credit card even though you did not know my room number.;5
People who read my reviews know that I tend to separate the character of the property from the management - because one can excel while the other is weak and vice versa.  An average of the two would provide little insight to travellers about which elements are strong.  One of the pleasures of travel is that every once in a while you come across a property that is truly excels in both - and whose process of weaving the property with their attention to detail lends itself to a truly unique and satisfying experience experience.  Riad Kheirredine is that kind of property.    The owner has, over time, integrated three Riads into one with 19 rooms and an abundance of space and experiences.  The property is much like others, an integrated complex of rooms, hallways, stairs, terraces;5
Good restaurants   within walking distance if Hotel cannot satisfy.  The rooms are very comfortable. Off street rooms are quiet. In house restaurant hours and menus are not convenient but there are several outside within walking distance;5
My mom and I both love(d) this hotel! It has a fabulous location for a young arts enthusiast like myself (located directly across the street from NY Ballet, The Met, and Juillard School of Music, also right on Broadway) and the food nearby is also great. The hotel staff are extremely sweet and accommodating (Ze, the bald guy, is awesome!!!) as well. It is also a very chic looking inside with great sitting areas for working or hanging out. Overall a lovely experience, I highly recommend.;5
Had a wonderful stay. Anthony is amazing!! So kind and professional. We really enjoyed our stay. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is beautiful, too. Thanks for hosting us, and thanks to your great staff!;5
I had a business meeting of four people and a bit of a sticky situation. The lobby was full, but Avelino took me under his wing, found a nook, moved things around, and made it possible for us to hear each other and sit together, undisturbed.  When one of my party arrived and happened to speak to him at the Concierge desk, he knew immediately where to bring them, and they were amazed that he had it all figured out.  Hats off, give this man a bonus.;5
We stayed one night on a lay over. Must say it was a very conveniently located hotel and not pricey at all. Has 24h a day shuttle service to the airport. Staff was friendly and food there was good. Check in and out was a snap! Would definitely stay here again.;5
Located in an ideal location, subway entrance close to hotel, close to a lot of  tourist attractions, felt safe & secure w/security in lobby. Concierge desk came in very handy to guide us w/directions to where we wanted to go. Would stay here again.;5
A very friendly boutique-style hotel. Excellent location, only a short walk to the very heart of Times Square. Situated just off Broadway this hotel offers luxury & comfort. I have never slept in such a comfortable bed. Will stay here again & will definately recommend. This was a gem if a find.;5
Nice hotel. Courteous/helpful staff. Enjoyed the food and craft cocktails. Very close to LAX Rooms very modern and spacious. Weather was cool so couldnât enjoy the pool area but it looked nice. Great place to stay if youâre traveling through LAX;5
"I'm a NYC resident, but we're always looking for a go-to hotel for mini ""stay-cations"" or to recommend to visiting friends and family. We tried the Ameritania at Times Square this past weekend (NYC Marathon weekend) and were BLOWN AWAY by the service! Immediately, we were allowed to check-in early, we were asked if we wanted any recommendations, and it really seemed as though the staff cared about our visit and what we'd be doing while in the area. Our room was clean, the view was amazing, and the bathroom was spotless. (For anyone concerned about AC/heat: you can adjust your room temperature within seconds, this was great!). The next morning, we had to wake up early and check-out around 8am, and Maura at the front desk was great. She offered to hold our bags for the day, we";5
We had 3 nights stay in Empire Hotel. It's better than we expected. The room is in a very good condition. It seems being newly-renovated. The location is excellent! You pretty much can walk everywhere. We highly recommend it to the travellers. We'll certainly go back to that hotel for our nex New York trip.;5
Our family had two connecting rooms for two nights at this recently remodeled and upgraded Hilton - one of the best Hiltons we have stayed at.  The rooms were quite large and well appointed and the beds were wonderful.  We were pleasantly surprised at the relatively low price for the rooms.  The food and service at the family-friendly restaurant on the lobby floor were excellent although the buffet was overpriced.    We stayed at this hotel because we were visiting the Universal City theme park.  The free shuttle to and from the park every 15 minutes made the visit all the more enjoyable.  The place to stay if you are visiting Universal!!;5
My husband and I visited NY this week for pleasure. We booked the Empire hotel and was very happy. I would like to give a shout out to Pasquale at the front desk. His customer service skills are nothing but very helpful. I needed copies of something important I needed mailed and an envelope. Without a question he helped me out and was very pleasant. Thx u again Pasquale I appreciated ur help.;5
The staff was very helpful and friendly. Gave me very helpful tips/suggestions. If I ever return I will stay at this hotel again. I've never traveled on my own and this might sound silly but I was worried but the hotel made me fee very conformable.;5
Ok, i wrote the most scathing review of this hotel about 18 months ago that i have EVER written.  I checked into the 'new' Hyatt .....and was shocked.  I wont go on, but it was not a good experienced.  I swore I would never be back...  Well, I lied!  The greeting, and front desk staff....PERFECT!  I wish I remembered her name!!  My room, FANTASTIC.  Quiet, especially for an airport hotel.  BEAUTIFUL, clean, and comfortable.  I didn't want to leave!  I was upgraded to a suite (Diamond member...or whatever that new name is).  The Gold Passport lounge might also be one of the best in the chain.  The team was warm and welcoming, the space was large....and CLEAN!  The food offerings were plentiful and great!  Loved it! Used it!  Great lounge.  To say this hotel has transformed is an;5
Highly recommended!!! Brilliant place to stay that is central to everything you need. Staff where all excellent they even helped us get tickets for the baseball match which made our trip so thank you again, we will definitely be back on our return to Newyork.;5
We stayed 4 days at the Hilton Universal Hotel - the service was FABULOUS! Roxanne at the front desk was a gem.  We Will definitely return here for another stay. waking distance of studios and the Metro - which we took into downtown LA - easy connection -no hassle;5
This was a great hotel for a fair price. All staff friendly and accommodating. Clean and fairly spacious. The heating and AC systems are out dated so it can get hot on the top floors. Bed was a little hard....;5
Awesome location at a great value. Right next Madison Square Garden and the garment distric. Rooms are kind of small. Staff are friendly. The hotel restuarant is open 24/7 and has a large variety of food.;5
I stayed in this hotel with my family for one night when arriving in la before sailing out the next day. The hotel was extremely clean and tidy and the staff very friendly.   The food in the bar could have had more of a selection so if your a fussy eater I would eat elsewhere.  The pool area was lovely and although we didnât take a swim it was certainly inviting.   The free shuttle from the airport to the hotel was also extremely efficient.   Highly recommend fantastic stay;5
Have stayed hers before, was due again this month.  Due to the virus we cannot travel and have had to defer the holiday until next year 2021..  We are lucky that we have a member of staff who is caring and understanding!  Her name is Neida Aldama!  What a brilliant person who has helped us all the way with our cancellation and rebooking a new holiday!  There has been a small charge in line with the cancellation criteria but I am sure we will not lose out with this Lady looking after us!  I want to thank her and all the staff who have helped us !  Well done the New Yorker!;5
I really enjoyed my stay at the New Yorker! From the front desk staff, down to the cleanliness of the room. Iâd recommend this hotel to friends and family! Canât wait for my next trip to New York! See ya next time!;5
the beautiful in there nice town check in the lobby have wifi great for play for chilidren go to shopping  go to universal studio go nice resturant go to night club great music the bar nice  for talking;5
A very nice place, I recommend it to everyone with children and married couples.great prices and views. Very good location, and the hotel staff very nice and helpful. Food delicious, my opinion is 5/5;5
Such a beautiful place. Roberto is amazing and  gives the best service anyone could ask for! The customer service, the ambiance, the delicious food... itâs a true paradise in the middle of a pandemic! I canât wait to come again.;5
We bought a 2-day L.A. Universal Studios ticket.  As Hilton Gold member, we tried out the Hilton Los Angeles Universal City for one night.  1st day: we drove from northern california to Hilton Universal City hotel, check-in around 2 pm, parked our car, walked to Universal Studio.  At the end of visit, drove car out to visit friend for dinner.  2nd day: checked out room at 11am after having breakfast in the hotel. Left the car in the garage. Took free shuttle to Universal Studios.  We were informed that the overnight parking ends at 6pm, so we finished our 2nd day at 5pm, then picked up our car  Pros: - walking distance to Universal Studios, or take the free shuttle bus every 15 minutes from the Hilton Hotel.  We did both. - spacious and quiet room - free WiFi - As Hilton Gold;5
I had the great pleasure of staying at the Riad Kheirredine for three nights to celebrate my birthday in Marrakech. From the moment I arrived at the airport and was picked up by the private driver, the care and attention to detail was apparent. Upon arriving at the Riad I was greeted by Lamia who I considered the best host ever. She gave me a tour of the Riad, and provided information on how to make my trip special. The on site restaurant prepares a feast for breakfast and amazing chicken tagine for dinner. I could not leave without visiting the Spa/ Hammam, I left with my skin having a healthy glow and feeling fresh and smooth. The other members of the staff were also very helpful and attentive. They presented me with a cake for my birthday and proceeded to sing, it was very;5
Located at Lincoln Center and 1 block from Central Park I felt right at home at the Empire Hotel. Early in the morning I stopped by the front desk to pick up running routes near by. The morning team suggested the central loop and reservoir, which I loved. In the evening the lobby bar was great for a night cap.   I had a great time and really enjoyed meeting everyone!;5
My friend and I arrived in Marrakech in the heat of the summer, and were so thankful to have chosen Riad Kheirredine. The design of the riad was spectacular, the staff was incredibly, incredibly thoughtful. Coming back everyday really felt like such a respite from the heat, and there were some days where we spend hours on the rooftop where they had a pool (one of two).   I can't recommend this place enough. They have moroccan iced tea on tap, cookies in every room, fruits in all the common areas, and staff who are attentive and always willing to help. They would also have someone accompany us the first couple of days as we learned to navigate the maze to the entrace of the medina. You also get your own phone that allows you to have 24/7 contact with the hotel. I will definitely;5
"The hotel is wonderfully located. It is right by Lincoln Center, Columbus Square, Central Park and some of the best attractions in NY, such as the Natural Hist. Museum and the MET. It is, however, a bit further north of really crowded tourist attractions like Times Square, which is GREAT, because it really sucks to be in the middle all that noise. The hotel is five (or less) minutes away from a market and food court, which is also great because, in our case, since we have a daughter, sometimes we just wanted a less ""restaurant-ish"" kind of food, and the market's food court provided us that kind of alternative.  As of the hotel, the room that was given us was spacious; the staff was really helpful and nice all the time. The cleaning staff was always very careful with our room,";5
I asked a room away from the elevator but the hotel was almost fully booked. So Mr. Ze at the reception offered me a Suite Deluxe at PH floor instead of my standard queen!  Thank you again Mr. Ze, what a treat in NY tonight!;5
The hotel is in such a great location.  Old, but lots of history!  Staff very friendly and accommodating.  Close to the subway, Macy's and a nice walk to Times Square as well as Chelsea.  It's location means it's an easy trip north or south!;5
We stayed at the Riad for 4 nights last week and what a wonderful time we had, right from the welcome from all of the staff to checking in to our beautiful room and the hospitality during our stay. I would highly recommend staying here if you want an authentic Moroccan experience. It is in the heart of the medina but it is so peaceful once you are in the Riad itself . Beautiful decoration and very clean. We were given a phone in case we got lost and we were always met by one of the lads to get us back. Fabulous breakfast and beautiful breads and mint tea and great views from the top would absolutely stay here again. We travel all over the world and this was a wonderful experience  Thank you for making it special;5
"Location, location, location â Ameritania was the perfect base camp for my wife and I to see three Broadway plays in two days. We also had tickets to watch a live taping of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which was around the corner from the hotel. And one of the plays was on the same block! Add a real bargain of a rate; a comfortable, modern lobby and room, and a friendly and professional staff, and we were thoroughly pleased. Bravo!";5
Was able  to check in early. Great location, nice cafe downstairs.  Very close to Penn Station, you can take a train to anywhere. Good security, have to have a key to get up the elevators, and they always checked. Easy check-in and check out, held our bags downstairs for us all day.;5
Had a wonderful time Hotel is very centrally located. Friendly staff great rooms. Really enjoyed the history lessons down by fitness center. Bed was comfortable really like the balcony view. Bathroom was very clean.;5
All the other attractions we went to were close from this hotel. We went to Universal Studios, Disneyland and the Santa Monica Pier.  Room was very clean. Staff was excellent. The shuttle to Universal was always on time.;5
Nice location (close to central park and the metro colombus circle), very nice and big room and good american breakfast.;5
Excellent resort when traveling in and out of LAX. Prompt, quick shuttle service to airport. Attentive and responsive hotel staff. Quiet, comfortable, and highly upgraded rooms. Window coverings kept room dark in the morning. Didn't use the pool, but it looked inviting. Will stay here again.;5
Loved this hotel. On arrival we were given an upgrade by Pasquale to a suite which was beautiful, with a view over Broadway. Beds were comfortable and made up each day. Towels were also changed daily and everything was very clean. Special thanks to Eugene, one of the doormen, who was really helpful when asking for directions and recommending places to eat. Would definitely stay here again if I'm ever lucky enough to return to New York.;5
My wife and I were stuck in NYC because of a storm that cancelled all trains to Long Island.  We needed somewhere to stay and the New Yorker was a great choice.  It was reasonably priced, clean, and very quiet.  It's not so bad to be stuck in the city overnight, so whether an emergency or you plan for it, The New Yorker is a great choice.;5
A lovely Art Deco hotel that is in a perfect location for your stay in New York.  Polite and helpful staff, nothing was too much trouble. The New Yorkers most famous occupant wasTesla and there is a âmuseumâ downstairs that is well worth checking out!  We will definitely stay there again!;5
Excellent Hotel perfect location was worried about noise on Times Square but didnÃ¨t hear nothing at night Staff very professional and friendly Rooms very clean and well equipped Recommend this Hotel and cant wait yo go back!;5
"I stayed in this hotel for only one night as i booked other hotels. As soon as i arrived i regretted booking those other hotels.  The building gives you and instant cozy feeling as soon as you walk in. the staff were very friendly and professional.   i stayed in the 50sq foot room, when i looked at the photos i thought ""man this room is tiny how will i fit my bags"" but once i got there i found the room had enough storage space for about 6 suitcases! the only downside i have was the price of the room was about $100US at the time which i thought was a little steep.  the bed was nice and firm,  the room had A/C, a TV and a little window that looks out on the street.  the hallways are warmly lit and the way the building is designed makes it feel a bit like a maze.  a slight downside";5
We stayed there for 4 nights. The location is wonderful. Very close to Penn station and lots of attractions. We had a basic room with 2 double beds. The only thing I did not like was there was no coffee pot or fridge in our room but we did know that when we booked the hotel. We were checked in by Mohamed who was very friendly, he got us an early check in and gave us a room with a view! This hotel worked great for our quick vacation.;5
I stayed 8 nights at the Empire Hotel and I can strongly recommend it. It was easy to find when I first arrived, it's near two subway stations (Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle), the rooms are very comfortable and clean, the hotel staff is friendly and helpful, and they also received a package I ordered online without charging any fee. I think the only negative point would be the small and dark room, but they have different room options to chose from - I took the cheapest one.;5
Wow, what an impressive airport hotel. Modern, spotless, spacious with truly professional staff. We were so impressed. We ate here and the food was incredible. Our room was excellent and so quiet. I'd highly recommend staying here. The only negative was that the bell man didn't turn up on the day we were leaving. To ensure we didn't miss our flights my husband collected the luggage from our hotel room instead. But I'm still giving this hotel a five star rating as it certainly deserves one. A gem of a hotel.;5
Everything about our stay was amazing!  My wife and I stayed at the riad for 5 nights during a week long trip to Marrakech. One of the deciding factors that made us choose this riad over alternatives was the glowing trip advisor reviews about customer service. The team definitely delivered on this front. Everybody was warm and friendly, and it was clear that the  priority for staff was to make sure all guests were having a relaxing and enjoyable stay.   On arrival day we were greeted at a meeting point by a staff member who took our cases and walked with us to the riad. The riad location is away from the main hustle of the city in a relatively quiet neighbourhood. We knew this before booking and were aware of some other reviews which say it's a drawback, however we personally;5
Great shows in town.  And the take home wine glasses will always bring back for memories!  We signed in for breakfast in the special room they have!  Loved all the fresh fruit! Would go back to New York in a minute if only to see my goddaughter!;5
"Be sure to visit Andrea in the hotel lobby! She is a drink expert!  She whipped us up some amazing cocktails that tickled the senses! We will b back solely to visit this good spirited soul! She will leave u with a smile on ur face! ; )";5
We always love visiting NYC, but need to do low price lodging in order to afford the attractions.  Ameritania was marvelous.  The closeness of the subways and restaurants was appealing.  The desk person recommended Cascade for breakfast and boy was she right on.  The prices were ridiculously low for the quality.  Room sparkling clean and pleasant though small.;5
From the moment we arrived we have been greeted by every staff member encountered and made to feel welcomed and valued. The customer service has been fantastic. I definitely would recommend this property.;5
Merci Ã  toute lâÃ©quipe nous avons passÃ© un beau sÃ©jour merci surtout Ã  Pil I give you a 5 stars! The hÃ´tel is very clean and very beautiful and All thÃ© staff Was very helpful and kind iâll go back anytime;5
I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was the best service I have ever experienced in any hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and willing to accommodate (or in most cases, predict) any and all requests. Make sure to build time into your itinerary to simply relax at the hotel. The rooms, lounge areas on the rooftop, libraries and parlors - it's a beautiful and relaxing place.   Additionally, the staff went out of their way to make sure that we had a unique and safe/comfortable visit. They provided cell phones and would come meet us at any location in the old city if we were lost or needed assistance. On top of everything, the food was well prepared and delicious for breakfast and dinner in one evening. Not to mention, the complimentary fruit, cookies, water, tea and;5
Just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel with my Mum. On arrival, Jeff the doorman made us feel very welcome and gave us a detailed map of sights to see. He even arranged our transport back to the airport whilst we were waiting for our room keys.  The location was perfect for us. 3 mins walk to Times Square & 10 mins walk to Central Park.  Nice room with very comfy beds. Great stay!;5
had a great stay at this hotel, Staff were very good, in all departments, it is in a very good location, we were able to walk to  many of the places of interest we wanted to see, :ie times sq, Bloomingdales, 5th avenue, macey's, etc. would definitely stay there again.;5
The service, staff, room, and location of this hotel is great! Fighting LA traffic is the worst!! Staying here was a total breeze and the proximity to Universal Studios makes it truly worthwhile. We received wonderful service from a very conscientious staff! Looking forward to staying here again!;5
Be prepared for the ultra tiny cabins. The hotel is so charming & in the most fascinating part of the West Village, right by the High Line. My mom stayed there & loved it & the prices cannot be beat. The bar, restaurant & rooftop all make the hotel stay a real treat for anyone coming to NYC.;5
Excellent in every way.  Room size, decor and appeal was outstanding.   Doormen very helpful on cold days and pushing hey doors for old folks.  This is the second time I have spent a week-end in the Empire and love the access to the MET.;5
Great place to stay!  newly renovated, great food, great proximity to the airport, super friendly staff (thanks Lexis :))  I will definitely be visiting again in the future and I absolutely loved the view over the airport from my room :);5
we stayed here during the jubilee celebration. we were welcomed by so many nice receptionists and our room was very nice and clean. we has breakfast and dinner, and we thought the quality of the food is execllent. next time we are back in London we will stay here.;5
The location is excellent. The hotel is located between Times Square and Central Park. All the staff are very friendly and helpful, and are available at all times. The room is not very big, but it is equally comfortable. I recommend it!;5
If you are only heading to LA for a short time and Universal Studios is on your to do list, this hotel would be a great choice.  If you're spending a lot of time in Hollywood or Downtown LA, it may not be the best choice unless you are traveling outside peak traffic times.  Reception was helpful, check-in swift and room was a good standard.  Local food choices are a little limited late at night, but we always managed to find somewhere to eat.;5
As a former resident of Manhattan, I stayed at The Empire Hotel and was very impressed with their rooms, service, price, and location. I highly recommend it to others in need of a high quality option.;5
A great place to stay on the Upper West Side. Safe and clean. Front door gentlemen very courteous, helpful, & respectful.   Front desk personnel professional and helpful. Across the street from Lincoln Center and within walking distance to other venues and restaurants.;5
New York is a GREAT city and the Empire Hotel made my stay everything that I hoped it would be. New York is fabulous and so are all the staff at the Empire Hotel.;5
Ok so I read a lot of reviews for this hotel before I decided where to stat and unless your review is a 5 star review then you must complain about everything imaginable. I am not here to complain about a piece of wallpaper that wasn't glued properly or a TV that isn't big enough or waiting more then 10 seconds for an elevator.  If you stay here for family vacation for universal like we did, you will be happy. We walked to Universal and the city walk each of the 3 days we stayed there. You can ride the shuttle but we walked it. 5 minutes and you are there. We stayed on the 11th floor with a view of the park and were perfectly fine without upgrading to a higher floor.  The pool was nice it was heated the area was clean, you can get drinks down by the pool. Water was nice;5
I love Pil heâs the best so sweet and always has a positive attitude. Make sure to go to Pil heâs the best you wonât have any complaints he always makes sure everything goes smooth when I stay I love him make sure to go to Pil  10/10 highly recommended he will make sure everything goes well.;5
This year was a bit more pleasant on check-in and waiting time except the room was not ready at 3PM.  Waited 1/1/2 hours to access it.  Otherwise love the Tick-Tock dinner and the Italian restaurant in-house.  Room was clean and comfortable as well as quiet.  They did have elevator problems with long waits, but a letter of apology was distributed. Also the revolving door was not working for the majority of time I was there.  There was extra staff working the manual doors that helped the situation--this also provided extra eyes for security.;5
I stayed at the Ameritania with a friend and we both loved the location. It's so easy to get anywhere from there, by using the subway, walking or taxi. It's a good value hotel given its proximity to major sites and broadway shows. We booked a deluxe with two double beds. The beds were extremely comfortable. The ensuite was very modern and clean and the shower was lovely and powerful. We expected more noise than there was given where it's located and only had interrupted sleep due to jet lag! I'd definitely return to the Ameritania on a future trip.;5
Really nice stay at this hotel. Everyone was super friendly and the pool was great. Felt clean and Covid safe. We would definitely stay here again. Also loved that it was pet friendly as we had to bring our dog with us.;5
all staff very accomadating and nice i am sabbath observant and yhey were able to tens to my needs without any hesitation all in all. place is very nice great location, fun / cool vibe i would definatly stay therew again;5
Hollywood Hotel is a great place to stay. The free breakfast is amazing, Hugo makes the best omelets I've ever try. I would like to recommend this hotel and wish I can go there again in the near future.;5
I had a real great time at that hotel . Mor from the lobby bar was very useful, she helped me explore the city and gave me a real good advises . She was always with a smile and available to assist. Wish I could extend my staying !;5
Room was very clean, more spacious then  I had expected. For NYC, rooms are always tiny and this compared to other rooms that I've had in NYC before was quite nice. Quiet location, we had spectacular views of Central Park. 2-3 blocks away from the subway. For the price that you pay, this was fantastic! I would definitely go back to that hotel again. No amenities available but then again, when you go to NYC, it's not to stay at the hotel.....;5
Here for a business trip with a little fun on the side. The conference was at the Hilton and was well-run. Our room was clean. Maid service was very thorough and efficient. And walking distance to Universal studio!;5
My friend and I stayed in a double room, and were very pleased. The staff were all very nice, efficient, and dedicated to the enjoyment of our stay. The restaurant Cafe Sierra in the hotel was a little too expensive for the quality in our opinion, but the location of the hotel was very close to City Walk with plenty of other restaurant choices. Very close to the metro, allowing us to explore the Walk of Fame and Griffith Observatory. I would absolutely come back.;5
Hotel was everything you can ask for in New York. It was clean, perfect location, beds were comfortable, and staff was friendly.   The room is small, but has everything you need. The shower was absolutely amazing for New York standards, and overall the room was very quiet. We stayed on the 10th floor (not facing the street), and could hear no street noise.   We will definitely be back!;5
My partner and I stayed here over the St Paddy's weekend and It was great.  Our check in experience with Mohammad was great nothing was too much. His service was second to none. Just so you know the there is a service charge of $23 per room per night and they request a Credit card for a deposit of $100. This was returned to my credit card by the time we returned back to the UK.  Our room was on the 20th floor room 2040 it had not been renovated however had a great View of the Empire state building and was clean and big enough for us not to trip over each other. The bathrooms were a little small and in need of updating but not really an issue for us.  We ate a couple of times in Tick Tock and found it to be good value for money. Great Portions and staff were pleasant enough;5
We stayed at the Riad Kheirredine for three nights and enjoyed every single second at this incredible hotel. We were welcomed with open arms and felt at home from the very moment we arrived. The staff were incredibly helpful in organising our activities and navigating the hustle and bustle of this wonderful  city. Every tiny detail to make your stay enjoyable had been thought of and every wish or questions was met with a smile and helpful advice. The smallest things sometimes make the biggest difference and this riad offered all of them: free laundry services, an extensive breakfast menu, a rooftop nook for romantic dinners, a lovely hamam, fresh fruit everywhere, two pools to cool down in, porters that help you navigate the street labyrinth to the hotel and help with luggage;5
followed the advice of the reviews of the hotel being a business traveler friendly. the hotel wifi met my needs. no business center which is a downer but there is a courtyard that is useless empty and quiet. the rooms fit the business person. clean and organized. Iâll shout out Pil for the very professional attention. itâs lacking in other hotels in los angeles.;5
Excellent hotel close to the Lincoln Center. Highly recommended!!! Very helpful staff, especially Yuri from Concierge. The internet could be free, it was quite expensive. I would definitely stay again at the Empire!;5
My room faced the LAX sign and I did not hear any planes coming and going. The staff is helpful, the Concierge Lounge top-notch, and the lobby bar and restaurant are both solid. Comfortable and clean rooms and the staff is very responsive.;5
We stayed 3 nights and had a wonderful time, very good location to LA's main attractions. The room is Hilton AAA Style! No complaints.;5
Each year we stay at the Hilton Universal City when we conduct a large charity wine auction at Warner Bros. Studios.  We lead a group of volunteers, sponsors, winemakers and chefs on a very complex itinerary and the Hilton is our home base for it all.  We could not expect more from the Hilton and they exceed in every category from service to food with great rooms, an exemplary staff and a total experience that would be difficult to match by others.;5
Great service, super clean (albeit typically smaller) rooms, 24 hour impressive security, great big comfortable lobby, awesome location, and reasonable prices with optional incredible views.  Best value in town!;5
I had discovered this place on Trip Advisor and booked it for my husband's 40th Birthday treat. Before we even arrived in Marrakesh the staff were extremely helpful with all the advise they had provided.   Upon arrival I felt like I was reunited with old friends. Everyone was sooo friendly and helpful. We were greeted with a delicious breakfast and were immediately given a room upgrade. The place was beautiful. We were pleasantly surprised when we were given a black mobile to have at hand when we were outside of the Riad. The dinner was great there and the hammam treatment was exceptional. From the porters, chamber maids to receptionists we were treated like royalty. All of the rooms were clean and the absolutely beautiful. Just couldn't highly recommend it to anyone. It was a;5
the room is small, no amenities however the TickTock is downstairs, and Essen is a block up the street. That said the quiet, housekeeping, the view!, the many and fast elevators make up for the lack of amenities.  The staff is exemplary!  We had to change rooms due to a loud mechanical noise and the front desk clerk (Ananda) took very good and quick care of us.  The view from the new room was spectacular!  Location? Penn Station is a block away.  Close enough to walk to Broadway and Time Square but far enough from the craziness of Broadway and Time Square. MSG is around the way and the Empire State Building is...right there.  I plan to return!;5
Had a great experience at the Empire. Value exceeded expectations. Location is amazing and very friendly staff.  The room size is small but for the price it's perfect.  I stay in hotels 120 days a year so price and comfort are most important to me.;5
We had a 4 night stay at this perfect and cosy riad in the Medina of Marrakech. The riad itself is located about a 20 minute walk from Djemaa el Fna. At first you might think you will never find your way in this maze of narrow streets and big walls surrounding you, but no worries, the riad provides you with a phone. You can contact them whenever you need them or get lost.  Rooms are very tidy and romantic and with AC.  Staff is very friendly and helpful and will do whatever to make your stay pleasant. Breakfast on the roof terrace is just lovely, and will forever be memorized. Food was wonderful and so were the views. Soft drinks and tea and coffee are free and always served with a little snack.  I would recommend this riad to everyone, especially for young couples.;5
We stayed here for two nights during a trip to Universal Studios. The room was impeccable and we had beautiful views of the park. We felt like we were in the lap of luxury. The park was a short walking distance- maybe 5 minutes at most and we only took the shuttle one time because it just so happened to be outside when we walked out. It was an amazing experience and we will gladly stay here again.;5
I've been from Tokyo, Saigon, Seoul to London, Rome, Paris, Amsterdam and Crotia.  I'm 69.  Never been to New York City.  So this was a big deal.  My wife, who hadn't been to NYC since she was 16, found the Ameritania on a general search (Trip Advisor included).    She couldn't have possibly picked a more strategic and friendlier place.  From entry to exit, the staff was helpful, friendly, curteous, kind....  People like Assia who helped walk us through the procedures for our first NY subway experience.    Now, when we first checked in we were assigned 922.  You don't want 922.  It's the size of a walk-in closet with a single window view of three brick walls.  When the guy brought up our luggage walked in, he called the front desk and asked for a reassignment which occured the;5
Overall a great hotel, located just a 5 min walk from Central Park and 15 /20 mins walk from Times Square.   The hotel staff are extremely friendly and are always available if you have questions   The hotel itself is a good standard. Rooms arenât huge but are more than adequate for the amount of time spent there given the nature of the break. Beds are very comfortable and air conditioning works well if needed. Would have liked coffee / tea making facilities in the room but there is a Starbucks on the corner outside the hotel which comes in handy.   Sadly due to the weather  the outdoor rooftop bar was shut but this is understandable for safety and the bar inside is well worth a visit.   I would stay here again and would highly recommend;5
After 52 years went back to New York and stayed at the same hotel. After a makeover the hotel still has the art deco look that makes it unique. Welcomed by courteous professional staff who made checking in a breeze. Great central location with all the facilities you need including a diner and restaurant. Small rooms a tight squeeze with luggage etc. A great stay.;5
I wasn't sure what to expect but this hotel was very nice and in an excellent location.  I really didn't need to leave the area for anything.  The staff was very friendly as well.  The restaurant could use a little overhaul but other than that it was a great stay.;5
I don't quite know where to start. Should it be with the beauty of the Riad? The views from the roof terrace? The outstanding personal service throughout the whole stay? Booked over the Internet based on reviews, with no deposit requested or paid we went to Marrakech. The hotel had arranged transfers, perfect, no issue. We were dropped off at the square Sidi Ben Slimane, as far as the taxi could go, our luggage was placed in a barrow and we were guided to the Riad. Yes, it's a bit unnerving in the dark the first time you go, a few minutes through narrow dark cobbled backs are going to be anywhere. However, in daylight once guided it's fine, and actually adds to the experience. We were given a phone, maps, and the staff are available 24/7. Brilliant. They all went the extra mile;5
I spent a week at The Empire Hotel for business and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I had issues with any aspect of the hotel. New York is an expensive place to stay, so nowhere is going to be great value for money, as you would spend a lot for just a 2* in Midtown. The location was key for me, very close to Central Park and a few minutes from Metro Subway stations, close to shops.  A very nice and welcoming hotel lobby and rooms that were perfect for someone travelling solo and on business.  If you have the budget, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and I would have no issues staying here again.;5
We had a wonderful time in Hollywood we recommend this place to all. The airport ride was crazy but worth it better than a taxi. We arrived late but Jermaine was an amazing host he made our check in and gathering info easy. I did my research but he was good and hes not even a LA native. We enjoyed the hotel amenities and the staff, food, and pool was pretty sweet. Some rooms are nicer than others but overall nice. The courtyard is a amazing and worth the view.;5
Beautiful hotel! Right across from Universal Studios. Great view of universal Studios! They have a shuttle every 10 mins to get to Universal Studios/ City Walk. Great restaurant and bar. Highly recommend this hotel if visiting Universal Studios. Itâs a 9 minute walk or quick shuttle to get to Universal Studios. You have to pay for parking but good until 6 pm the next day. We stayed one night and checked out the Next day. We was able to leave the car there until 6 pm. It worked out great because Universal Studios closed at 6 pm. Will definitely stay here again!;5
Great service at the front desk. Solid guy by the name of Brian made me feel very welcomed and recommended many places around the area. I will definitely come back here again. Had a great time with my gf :);5
Went to NY with 3 friends, we shared a room with 2 beds and it was amazing. The hotel is very clean, beds are comfortable, rooms with an amazing view, the decoration is cool, bathrooms are a little small but its ok. The price we payed was very low compared to other hotels nearby. It is located near Times Square, you can easly go there walking. Also, the dinner downstairs has delicious food.  I don't advise buying vouchers to the hotel breakfast, because they only serve toasts, juice and coffee (a breakfast when you need to discover all that NY has to offer needs to be more complete lol). Still, nothing bad to say about it, loved it.;5
The Ameritania is a smallish hotel on a very busy street on the high end of midtown. It's a few blocks south of Columbus Circle and Central Park. The location is perfect for all of your touristy needs. The hotel itself is in an updated beautiful old building with modern decor. It's very clean. My room was tiny and faced the inside of the building so no views but the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was lovely and modern with CO Bigelow products.;5
Very nice place swanky place to stay! People are nice. Gustavo communicated very clearly & respectfully. He was very professional. The hotel is very close to local dive bars & restaurants. The outdoor pool is beautiful & my kids had a blast in it! Love how the parking lot is gated. Style & vibe of this place is updated. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.  We will very likely stay again when we want to bring the rest of the family to Universal Studios.;5
Had a great stay at this hotel. Nice hotel staff, perfect location and everything was very clean. Our 2 person room was kinda small, but we didn't mind, cause we were only there to sleep. House cleaning was excellent and everything was close by.;5
The hotel itself is very nice and modern.  Check in was swift and fast, took less than 2 minutes.  The rooms are clean and very spacious! The shining star of the hotel is miss Stacey in the bar! She is so accommodating, kind and great at her job.  The hotel is lucky to have her on their team.  Shout out to Celine in the club lounge as well, she was personable and kind as well.  We stayed for 3 days and the staff was overall very accommodating, highly recommend!;5
Stayed for 4 nights just as things were being locked down due to the Coronavirus.   Location is excellent for Universal Studios, parking is under the hotel.   Staff were friendly, efficient and really helpful.  Kevin the Front Desk Manager, and Kestor the Restaurant Manager in particular were the reason we will be booking our next stay at this awesome venue.;5
I stayed at Hollywood hotel for 3 nights and it was a very pleasant experience. I arrived in the hotel with no reservation and Gustavo at the front desk gave me a warm welcome and a manager on duty also. It was too early to do the check-in so Gustavo made me a reservation and I  came back a few hours later to check-in.Left my baggage in the storage room . I wanted to take a look to the room before making the reservation, but Gustavo was so professional and kind that I didn't doubt to stay in the hotel and made the correct decision ,my stay was great. The hotel is well maintained and clean,everything works well in the room,including the ac. The subway is a block away from the hotel so it is easy to   go to other areas of Los Angeles. Thanks for everything to all the staff and;5
We had an incredible time in NEw York City and The Empire Hotel was the perfect place to stay.  The location was great, the staff was very helpful, both the lobby and rooftop bars were very cool.  It was beautiful to see the fountain at Lincoln Center from our room.  We will definitely stay at the Empire Hotel next time we are in the City.;5
Worked very well for our family of four adults - stayed in the New Yorker suite which was like having two rooms for the price of one.  All had fabulous hot showers every morning. Amazing views of the Empire State Building especially at night time when lit up with red and blue during the election.  Very close to lots of sight-seeing locations, excellent shopping, subway and Penn station across the road. Convenient to have two dining options on the groundfloor as well as multiple places nearby.  Loved the historic art deco lobby.  Room perfectly clean and tidy on our return each day.;5
I have no complaints whatsoever abouth this beautiful hotel. Our original room was facing the side of the hotel that was exposed to the afternoon and evening sun, so when we checked in it was very warm and even turning the thermostat down to 66 degrees did not cool it off. We called down to the desk and they sent up someone to check the air conditioning...the room temperature was still 74 degrees....which may be fine for some people, but a little too warm for me. They offered to transfer us to another room (which was actually an upgrade). The new room was big,cool and with a beautiful view. The room was very clean. Needless to say, we were very satisfied.  The only issue we had was not the fault of the hotel. It was Universal Studios Frankenstein weekend( although it was only;5
Best bar in NYC. Ask for Kenny's candy and you are done on this world. Love the bar, rooms and everything else. No place like it, I know what I'm talking about because I have seen it all. Don't think just act;5
hollywood hotel is a hotel which is in close proximity to Universal studios and avenue of the stars. staff was friendly and guided me how to make my way to Santa Monica beach. overall i'm very satisfied with my stay at this hotel.;5
We stayed here for one night on our way home from a long-haul trip.  I had originally booked at an expensive Santa Monica hotel, but decided it was too much to haul the luggage, get a cab, etc.  SO Happy we changed our booking to the Hyatt.  Their shuttle runs every 15 minutes from the airport so it was a very quick pickup.  The check-in staff was extremely friendly and speedy, and our room was great.  Very clean bathroom and bedroom, lots of space for our luggage and family of 4.  We had very minimal needs while we were there but the bell hop offered lots of suggestions when he helped us to the room.  I was pleased they had a 24 hr fresh market with sandwiches, drinks, etc.  We did not purchase anything from there but it seemed reasonably priced.  It was less than 5 minutes;5
Like coming home and finding that you have staff to look after your very whim. There truly is nothing that the staff will not do to make your stay perfect.Of course the rooms, service and meals are outstanding. But it is more than that. It is the genuine and respectful friendliness shown by all the staff.;5
Even though we're New Yorkers, the Empire Hotel is still a getaway in our own hometown. Although we often come just for dinner, we recently decided to spoil ourselves and spontaneously booked a room for the night.   The experience surpassed our expectations. Much like the lobby and the hotel restaurant, Eds Chowder House, the rooms are immaculate and tastefully decorated. Yet more than the great food and comfortable room, what stands out most is Empire's tremendous customer service and attention to detail.   We were checked in by Jerry and Ricky at the front desk. Both took it upon themselves to make sure our stay was perfect. I have seldom had such memorable interactions with hotel staff. In fact, the hospitality demonstrated by Jerry and Ricky is the main reason I decided to;5
Gorgeous hotel in a convenient location. Staff is friendly and helpful and our room was spacious and beautifully decorated. Competitively priced with other NYC hotels. Easy to get to from JFK and LaGuardia via cab or public transportation.;5
The Hyatt Regency LAX is one of the nicer airport hotels I've stayed in.  It's very convenient to the terminals (almost walking distance if you don't want to lug baggage) and there is a shuttle bus that runs frequently.   Most airport hotels tend to be a bit grungy due to the high volume of traffic.  This one, however, is bright and clean.  The rooms are modern and bright and very quiet, considering how close to the airport it is.    I always stay at this hotel when traveling through LAX and needing an overnight stay.    Definitely recommend it.;5
The service we got from the front desk was excellent and so personal. They gave amazing recommendations for restaurants and sites to see. The home decor on the room was great, it didn't feel like another chain hotel room and the view was great! The rooftop pool is very relaxing and the bar service was fantastic. Lastly the rooftop lounge is the hottest place to be in the evenings, good music, great vibes, good people, and great for spotting celebs.;5
My husband and I stayed at this hotel during a fall weekend.  We live in Philadelphia and we were able to take the commuter train and then catch Amtrak.  Penn Station was just across the street.  We lucked out!  Our room was one that was handicapped accessible, not only was it spacious but we had a view of the Empire State Building!  We were in walking distance of many of the sights.Although some people stated in their reviews that the lobby needed to be updated I thought that the lobby was part of the Hotel's Art Deco charm.;5
When going to NY next time I will absolutely consider coming back to hotel Ameritania. Nice room having the needed things including nice and comfortable bed and  cleanness was also fine. Enjoyed the central location .;5
From the moment we arrived we were treated wonderfully. Staff were all super helpful and the hotel has a great concierge. We received a free upgrade and found our rooms very clean with great comfortable beds. I don't remember the last time I had slept that well.  Easy walking distance to universal Studios and lots of shops n restaurants nearby to suit all tastes. I would definitely stay here again.;5
Beautiful hotel, expansive rooms, lovely views, amazing staff and excellent food! Loved that Universal Studios/City Walk is just around the corner, too. Location, location, location, this is definitely my hotel choice if I plan to visit LA again.;5
The hotel was beautiful and all of the staff professional and friendly.  My ten year old compared it to the type of service you get on a cruise ship.  The location is the best if you plan to do Universal Studios.  There is a shuttle that comes by every 15 minutes or so, but we just walked as it only took about 5 minutes.  It is a little uphill, though.  The kids enjoyed the hot tub and heated pool.  There was a large area with cabanas available.  The hotel restaurant had great food/drinks.  They had an awesome looking buffet, but we did not end up eating there.  Upon check-in we received a text from a service member and we were able to request a crib via text, which was convenient since we were out and about.  Highly recommend this hotel!;5
We were there only for one night to go to Kleinfelds Bridal Shop. The hotel wasn't too far away if you don't mind walking, which we didn't. It was also not a bad walk to Times Square and Macys. I booked a suite because there were 4 of us, and it was a good size. The half bath was a nice surprise. There were also 2 refrigerators. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, especially one of the doormen, whose name, unfortunately I can't remember. He recommended a pizza place and gave easy walking directions to Times Square and would not let me tip him until after I got back from both. Needless to say, I gave him a great tip. There was one issue with the roll-a-way bed, and I brought it to the attention of the front desk, it was taken care of quickly. All in all, this really is a;5
This is a typical Hilton hotel.  It's very nice.  The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are spacious.  Our room offered a nice view of the area.  The beds were comfortable (I travel a lot and I think Hilton has some of the best beds I've slept in).  We were only in this hotel for one night, and didn't arrive until after dark, so we didn't make use of any of the amenities, but this was a very nice hotel and I would definitely stay there again.;5
This hotel had everything. First of all it's cheap to stay, so you think it's going to be horrible. It's not. The rooms are nice the staff are friendly and it's perfectly placed to get anywhere you want to be. The sights are literally around the corner.;5
Stayed here for 5 nights from 3rd-9th April. Hotel is in a great location. Penn station across the road and Macy's down the block. We had a lovely view from the room. Yes the rooms are on the small side but manageable. Free safe in the room. Iron and ironing boars and hair dryer. One downside was we could here the pipes sometimes and got woke up at 6.30 am by this one morning. Called down to reception and they came up within 10 minutes to investigate. Tick Tock diner on site. Great breakfast but a bit pricey. Loads of delis nearby by for a cheaper alternative. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Had a great time staying here, the staff were all fantastic, a special mention goes to Jeff at the door and another member of staff whose name I forgot to get who gave us some great travel tips. When we first arrived we started to wonder out of the hotel to find somewhere to eat and and explore a little bit he pulled us aside and gave some great tips on where to go and where to avoid, invaluable to us who were visiting the city for the first time - every hotel should do this!   Rooms were very clean and housekeeping did a great job too.   There were only a few things that are worth pointing out:  1. The lifts in the mornings were very busy and often had long wait times, we were on the 9th floor so using the stairs was a bit of a pain!  2. No tea & coffee in rooms, I knew this;5
I have just come back from an August trip to the Riad Kheirridine and it was simply one of the most relaxing places I have ever been! The staff could not have been any nicer, especially Elena and the guys (Ibrahim & Abdu) serving dinner in the evenings were a pleasure to talk to! We were constantly looked after and when we did venture out of the Riad, we felt informed and knowledgeable of where we were heading and how to come back. We even got a phone from the hotel with internet etc.....really helpful! Take advantage of their transfer to and from the Airport, trust us, it's the safest, most reliable & best way to do it!The food, in particular the breakfast, was fresh, tasty and always amazing! The whole Riad is spotlessly clean and the superior room we had (Eucalyptus) was;5
"The hotel is very clean and modern.  Well laid out.  My room was spacious, modern and clean; very different in a pleasing way from other hotels.  The best thing was how quiet my room was being so close to the airport.";5
Riad Kherreidine is as close  to the perfect place to celebrate your 25th wedding anniversary as you can imagine. From the arrangements, which were seamless to the room which was delightful we were lucky to spend 4 nights there. Valentina, Elaina and the rest of the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. We can only recommend the Riad to everyone.;5
it was very good.  It was quick and easy, and as part of Wynham Rewards member, received an upgrade room at minimum cost.;5
We had a perfect one night stay at this Hilton while visiting Universal Studios Hollywood. We were upgraded to a corner King Suite with an amazing view of the park. I could not be happier with our stay!;5
We stayed at this property for 10 nights before we finalized our apartment. The reason we kept on extending our stay here was because of so many reasons - very courteous and hospitable staff, they help in luggage loading and checking-in (very rare in NY). The rooms are spacious enough in comparison to the city standards, they have a great taste in interiors (very nicely done lobby and rooms), all kind of services and amenities and they are located at a very convenient location which makes traveling around very easy. And it is not very expensive too considering we were staying during festival.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to all who are traveling to nyc and are looking for a 4 star options. P.S. We booked through hotels.com and bookings.com and we got great deals and;5
Riad Kheirredine is located in the medina in Marrakech.  Valentina, Elena and all the staff were wonderful.  They are so friendly and couldn't do enough to help us and make our stay in Marrakech just fabulous.  The food is very good - great breakfasts and a selection of Moroccan or Italian dishes on the menu at other times (make sure you try the Italian too!).  The rooms are lovely and there are many 'spaces' for enjoying quiet times within the riad - the terrace is great.  We loved our stay there, would definitely recommend it to others and I hope we will be back.;5
The hotel was nice and clean and fancy, but the internet connection could be better. The food was great but the dinner meals need to be bigger. Thank you for the experience of staying in a high class hotel near the airport for my trip to New York.;5
Every time I visit Universal I stay at this Hilton, the staff has always been incredible and the same can be said for their rooms.  I had booked this room rather late, a week in advance. We had decided to see a concert at the Gibson Amphitheater. There is a free shuttle service the operates between the Hilton and Universal Studios/Citywalk and even if you have to walk it is not that far at all.  Even though we arrived a little after hotel check-in time, our room was not ready. So they gave us vouchers for the Lounge to get appetizers. The room was well worth waiting for, had a spectacular view from the 19th. floor.  Internet if offered for a small fee unless you are a gold or higher Honors card holder.;5
We had a great time here. The service was great. It had an overall nice feel. Cold water in the lobby available 24/7. Cute bar with drink specials to hang out at. The room was great. Nice big bed and lovely bathroom. Spacious and clean. We will return !;5
All the staff are extremely nice and helpful but I would like to specifically find out Neida! She helped me to get all the amenities I was looking for and once the extra mile to help me dress up the room to surprise my wife! Also Bernice was extremely helpful and giving me clarification and making sure I got the right room and altogether piece of mind! A very pleasant experience!;5
We really enjoyed this hotel. Close to Universal Studios, a short drive from the main attractions Hollywood Boulevard, Iris Cirque du Soleil, Madame Tussaud, Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood Sign, Warner Brothers Studios, etc.The staff is really attentive, the rooms are spacious and the beds so comfortable. We were able to maximize our stay thanks to the good advice of the concierge. The buffet at the hotel is excellent, my son loved the ice cream machine and the chocolate fountain! There is also a Starbuck Cafe in the hotel. In addition, the hotel has a beautiful swimming pool and enough chairs. I recommend this hotel even if it is more expensive in the end it is more advantageous.;5
We had an excellent stay at this Riad. We stayed for 3 nights over the bank holiday weekend, went to Comptor Darna for dinner on the first night, had a cooking class with Fam d'Epices the next followed by a visit to Mythic Oriental Spa, we then tried to food at the outdoor BBQ (just OK and dont have the orange juice as they use ice from ta water to cool it). The last day we chilled in the Riad, went to the souk and then had dinner in the Riad!  I have broken the review of theriad into these areas:  Accommodation - rooms clean, very good size, exellent AC, morrocon themed, decent bathrooms, complimentary water and fruit daily. They were also cleaned very well daily.  Food - breakfast was fruit, fresh bread, crepes, eggs, juice and special requests were not a problem! Breakfast;5
The hotel staff always made sure we were safe and comfortable. We were always greeted and we were always offered refreshments. Everyone was friendly and outgoing, which really made our stay a lot more comfortable.  But above all is safety. We had a guide from the hotel pick us up from the taxi stand to the hotel. And after we checked in, we were walked from the hotel to the medina with instructions how to head back later. We were also provided with a map and an emergency phone. Just knowing that someone is there to care for us really eased our minds.;5
"The riad is absolutely beautiful. We were in the amber room, a spacious and finely decorated room almost at the top of the riad. Breakfast was fantastic with bread, pancakes and pastries, fresh fruit with natural or fruit yoghurt, eggs and coffee as you like. It was too much!   The staff were so friendly, always trying to help and offering free mint tea every time you came back from the medina; usually tea is accompanied by local biscuits or sweets. The riad organised our transfers and tours, and anything that we needed. I had a slight  stomach upset for a couple of days after dinner somewhere else, and the riad provided me boiled potatoes, rice and soup for no extra cost. They even bought some medicine for me.   In order to help you find your way in the medina when you arrive";5
We had a wonderful stay, our room was phenomenal and we found the staff to be very responsive, polite, and accommodating.  The location was perfect, with access to loads of places within walking distance, great restaurants, and easy to navigate public transportation.  We would definitely stay here again!;5
The hotel sits in Hollywood and I booked the hotel with a very reasonable price. The hotel has a large and beautiful parking lot on the back but you have to pay for the parking. The people in the reception are nice and friendly. The room is spacious and very classic. Beds are super comfortable and the whole experience is spectacular. Every detail in the hotel room is well decorated and designed. What is best of the hotel is they provide free buffet breakfast. The breakfast is not those cheap breakfast you can find elsewhere but those that you will pay $30 per person for. Overall, I really enjoy staying in the hotel for a night in such a price in such a great location. This is my must-go hotel in LA the next time I visit.;5
We recently stayed 5 nights at the Hollywood hotel and had a fantastic time the room was perfect and clean, the staff were friendly and professional parking was easy and secure and to top it all off when we left we travelled to San Francisco but on arrival we realised we had left our passports in the safe back in Hollywood.   One call to the Hollywood hotel and the passports were removed from the room safe, kept safe behind reception and posted to us in San Francisco. Brian on reception and Gisel the manager went above and beyond their normal hotel duties to help us in our time of need saving us from a 14 hour round trip back. I couldn't recommend the hotel enough fantastic place and exceptional service. Thank you so much.;5
This was my first time in Marrakech. My friend and I chose to stay at Riad Kheirredine based on the positive reviews here on tripadvisor. I can only say that this place excels any hotel Iâve ever been to (I usually stay within the hilton chain hotels) - even the conrads and the waldorf astorias! I have never seen such great hospitality. The girls at the reception welcomed us with such warmth that it made us feel at home right away. They helped us with every need we had (making reservations, calling taxis, having someone show us the way through the complicated medina and much more). Laundry services were included which was very convenient. Since our flight left really early in the morning we were really tired when we got there. But Emane had prepared a âlittleâ breakfast when we;5
We stayed at Riad Kheirredene for three nights in June and left feeling like we had been away for a week.  The staff here are just amazing - they make you feel welcome, safe, relaxed, pampered and well fed! Nothing is too much trouble and all of the staff are committed to ensuring you have a great time. They are also discreet, leaving you to do whatever you want to do, yet are available for you if you need anything. Although there are many rooms, we felt like we had the place to ourselves most of the time.  This is because there are so many areas to eat, drink, sit and relax. Our favourite spots were the restaurant courtyard for breakfast, the roof terrace sofas for simply lolling around, and for dinner, and the downstairs pool garden for cooling post-shopping drinks and;5
Great location and great staff.  Just around the corner we had Broadway and around the block a lot of restaurangs to choose between. Times square was just 500m down from the hotel. For the money we paid for the hotel we couldnt ask for more :).;5
Check in was awesome -  Mohammed took really good care to see that we got the best room with a wonderful view.  And he really delivered !!   Accomodations and the hotel restaurant were 5-star !!!  I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again !!!;5
We stayed from 23 to 28 December on the 20th floor in a standard queen. Check in was quick, staff were friendly and welcoming ( offered upgrade options but didn't take it).  The room was as expected clean tidy and enough space for us and our cases. The rooms were cleaned daily, room service available and always staff on front desk. Security always asked for room key before accessing the lifts.  Location great Penn Station on the doorstep ( main Subway line) and to our surprise madison sq garden opposite hotel entrance (see photo).  Would recommend hotel, good value, great location and lovely staff.;5
Starting off with our arrival: 1- Counter staff friendly and polite. 2- The concierge suggested a really terrific restaurant for lunch. 3- The doorman got us a cab and gave great NYC information. 4- Our room on the 39th floor had a wonderful view of the Empire State Bldg. We'll be back for the holidays!!;5
We stayed in the Jasmine suite for 3 nights.  Excellent service and great location for visiting the Jardine Marjorelle, (10 min walk), Jemaa el Fna (15 min walk) and the souks. The Riad will provide you with a mobile to use when you get lost. They will also guide you and point out specific landmarks to help when you are sightseeing.   Loved this place, and will be back.;5
One night stay between flights in/out of LAX. Shuttle was very quick and convenient. Room was very nice and competitively priced. Check in/out was very efficient. Dinner and beverages at LA Unity Lounge was very good and service was excellent.;5
I always try to stay at Hyatt when traveling all over the world for business and leisure (love those points and free nights!) and the Hyatt Regency LAX is a great example of why 24-hour room service and an excellent deli are vital for business travelers. I have stayed there 8 nights in the last 2 months (each of these for a 1-night stop over on  a long trip to somewhere else) and have been very happy every time. The 24-hour shuttle to LAX is easy, the staff is very helpful and friendly, and the hotel is clean, modern, comfortable, and well-appointed. The Grand Hyatt New York has recently lost my custom because they do not have adequate room service or other dining choices and the hotel is showing its age in that not-very-well-maintained way (although the people are always;5
Ali on reception was so helpful and friendly, nothing was to much trouble.  He made sure our stay was not only comfortable but provided us with information to enjoy the city. The room was lovely and clean and we never noticed cleaning staff around but it always seemed to be clean.;5
We had one of the best hotels stays at the New Yorker. We were given a suite complete with kitchen, sitting room, dinning room, bathroom and bedroom with further settees.  The service was as you always hopeful, first class all complemented by the concierge who arranged all our trips taxis and tours, thanks John.  Fantastic period decor in this 30's art deco building.  Highly recommended.   Just opposite Penn station and close to Macy's and the Empire State Building.;5
Excellent  place in the heart of NYC. Nearest of all places of interÃ©s in the city. The conditions and presentation of all thing is amazing... the customer services is always available and with correct solutions;5
Flew the day before our night flight home from South Carolina Got in at 4pm check in was fast and no issues Dropped everything and had quick drink at the bar, then headed out for dinner  Rooms great size we had king room  Very quite even thought you are right next to the airport  Check out is 12 noon so we will leave our bags and pick up before our late flight  Free shuttle every 20 mins 24 hours a day great service;5
We stayed here at the end of October. As it was my birthday, my husband upgraded us to a suite. We had a corner suite on the top floor with views out to the Hudson River, across to Times Square, and also to my favourite, the Chrysler Building. Fantastic hotel, Fantastic service and you must eat in the Tick Tock diner downstairs. It is their own retro diner and it serves up the most magnificent luxury waffles with fresh fruit. Very central location. We visited the high line which is just a few blocks over. Madison Square Gardens are across the road if you have tickets for a show. There is also a museum in the basement telling you all about the hotel and its refurbishments. Muhammed Ali stayed here when he fought Joe Frasier in 1971 so the hotel has a lot of history. There is a;5
This hotel is so perfectly located. Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square. Great amenities all around the hotel. Clean and comfy beds. Nicest and most helpful staff. Jeff helped us at arrival and helped arrange airport travel. Will return!!;5
The location was great for the Lincoln Center show we attended. Tommy, the doorman, helped me with all of my tourist questions. He was super knowledgeable and friendly with a great personality. Very happy with the service.;5
Fabulous hotel in the perfect location. Beds were like sleeping on a cloud. The bathroom was beautiful and the concierge first class. Would definitely stay here again. Everything was within walking distance with lots of diners for breakfast at reasonable prices in the locality.;5
"We stayed at the Ramada Hollywood for 3 nights, 04/06-04/09. We had a great stay. The rooms were big and clean. Ours had 2 queen beds plus a sofa, micro and fridge. The bathroom was on the small side, but it wasn't a problem for us. The location can't be beat; we were near everything, as we went to Universal Studios, Griffith Observatory, The Grove, Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Downtown. We had our own car, and the parking lot was big, well lighted and safe. They do charge $15 a day for parking, but it was much less than what they charge at other hotels in the Hollywood area. The neighborhood was not great, but we didn't have to step outside. The complimentary breakfast was very good, with waffles, eggs, sausage, different types of bread, cereal, coffee, juice and milk.

"If you are worried that the reviews for the Riad Kheirredine are too good to be true don't be; it really is amazing! Fantastic staff, service, rooms, facilities and food. Marrakech really can take the first time travellers by surprise and  it can feel over whelming till you acclimatise but the Riad Kheirredine is an ideal oasis away from the storm. An afternoon on the roof terrace is so refreshing after a day of figuring out the maze of the medina. All the little touches such as welcoming talk, mobile phone and fantastic staff add up to a truly welcoming stay. Tried both the Moroccan meal and the pasta. If you like something a bit spicy the pasta with chilli is amazing. We went away for 2 nights on a tour and the Riad couldn't have been more helpful; coordinating with the tour";5
We had an excellent visit to this hotel. Staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone!  Rooms were nice and we could see the park from our room. Pool was amazing. Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Wi Fi was spotty and the price was pretty high but overall we loved our stay!;5
Upgraded to a room with a view upon arrival without us even asking which is nice.  Room was small but comfortable and had all the working essentials. We was on floor 35. Great location near the penn station subway, walk away from time square. Plenty of nearby restaurants etc.   Tip. It's better to be higher to see a view and to drown out the city noise.;5
We absolutely loved our stay at Riad Kheirredine.  Everything was faultless, the warm welcome, beautiful immaculately clean room, the food, the atmosphere.  For a first visit, it was just perfect.  It was wonderful to experience the city and then relax in a quiet space, by the pool, before heading out to enjoy the evening.  The whole team was exceptional, but special thanks to Lamia for the warm welcome and assistance during our stay, Brahim for keeping us fed and watered and also Brahim for help with directions (apologies for any misspellings).  Highly recommended.;5
Had the pleasure of staying at this hotel in the first week of December.  Excellent accommodation very clean and friendly helpful staff.  The location of the hotel is tremendous! A short walk from Times Square & Central Park. Would stay again. Car service to return to the airport provided by the hotel was excellent and very reasonably priced  Highly recommend staying here;5
Perfect location. Rooms very nice but, small. Service and staff excellent. Hotel very clean. The lobby is a beautiful and comfortable place to hang out. The top of the hotel has gorgeous views. No pressure by any staff for tips.;5
Walked in, the bar had a good DJ on the check staff was lovely and the room was exactly like the images online.   The roof top bar is great and the location is perfect for getting about the city.  Would definitely return to the hotel.;5
We were forced to cancel our trip and stay here this month due COVID-19 reasons. Neida was super helpful and made the cancellation process very easy for us. Customer service is is definitely a 10/10!!!;5
hotel was very nice the rooms are clean service it's very good the chef Hugo was very nice person And the prices are not bad Thanks for everything Hollywood hotel   ...........................................................;5
I almost don't want to say good things about this hotel for fear of giving away a secret spot.  This hotel is in a great location, has good amenities, and a very fair price.  The queen room seemed large by comparison to other NYC boutique hotels.  While the bathroom is tiny - who care? Please don't tell everyone about this hotel - I want the prices to stay reasonable so I can stay here again.;5
I arrived in the early hours of the morning after a 3 hour flight delay and missed my connection to Brisbane.  I had 22 hours to wait and the airline was not helpful in getting me accommodation to rest.  I found a listing for the Hyatt Regency online and requested a day room, then got the free shuttle to the hotel.  The staff were very sympathetic to my situation and found me great room and let me check out a little late so I could get some much needed sleep.  The bed was super comfortable.  Great room and very well maintained.  Just what I needed.  My flight home will be much more bearable now!  Highly recommended!;5
Get a Alcove room its alittle larger then a regular room.Service great nice view facing HWY 101 If you like Buffets you will love this place Buffets Vegas style.Going to Universal Studio in early April Park not crowded longest wait in line 20min. Most rides walk right on. Gets alittle cold at nite City Walk nice, lots of good rest. Only problem is if you need to use your computer theres a internet fee. Parking alittle high. But my guess is most Hotels in Ca. you pay to park at Hotels.;5
Stayed here for the 2nd time to celebrate our 17th wedding   anniversary. We asked for a high room with a view. This hotel not only gave us a high room, but we had a terrace on the 38th floor. Thank you for helping to make our celebration so special.  That is two visits, and two great experiences.  Recommended you visit this hotel.;5
"I was with my mom on a vacation trip,the hotel was great,breakfast was awesome and nice staff and rooms;I will stay there again for sure on my next trip to LA!";5
"We were skeptical once arriving to the hotel but it was not so bad. The reviews are accurate the area is okay the hotel belongs somewhere else. We had a nice room facing inner court yard; aim for that if you can upon check in.   Make time to check out the bar, pool, sauna, small gym, and courtyard seating area. Bar there as well but not open it seems.   Breakfast is mediocre at best. (bland but options for toppings)   Staff was professional at least. (Cynthia, Jermain and Anna) whom I encountered the most.  Knowledgeable and always smiling unlike the staff at the W hotel.   Wish there was room service, 7 day a week bar, and bell service but maybe in the near future this can be a 4-5 star hotel.   Happy with our stay and pay the parking people and do your research I always look";5
We stayed at the Hyatt during a layover for our honeymoon. All of the staff was phenomenal. They each went out of their way to make our experience perfect. We had a late night meal when we arrived, and a couple drinks at the bar. We also had the breakfast buffet the next morning. All the food was delicious. I would definitely stay there again!;5
We loved our stay at the New Yorker. Our room was great, very clean and the bed was very comfortable. We arrived almost 3 hours early and they went ahead and let us check into our room. The hotel is across the street from Penn Station and very convenient to almost anywhere. We walked to Time Square and took the Subway to the Statue of Liberty. Couldn't ask for a better location! We will most definitely stay here again!;5
"I stayed now several time in this hotel, and it becomes to my second home. I know this hotel now for years, and I am always impressed by the flexibility, friendliness and the professionality of every staff member. I discovered this hotel over two years ago per accident and from this day on I always come back. Last time I smiled when somebody said ""welcome home."" I would like to give a special thank you to the outstanding staff at the front desk, led by Ms. Daria Odintsova where she is doing a great job and her team as well. They all doing their best to fulfill your needs immediately. Awesome!  Hey, folks. Don't miss visiting the new Rooftop Bar. It has an outstanding view. See my pictures of it.";5
We recently stayed at the Riad Kheirredine for my 40th and had one of the suites for 3 nights  They were really helpful in advance and arranged to collect us from the airport.  Having travelled a fair bit, Iâm always a bit wary of booking up the recommended excursions etc via the hotel, so we didnât.  However when we arrived you could see that their offers werenât to make them money, purely to ensure you had a great holiday.  On arrival they took all the details for dinners, Hamman etc that weâd booked and then made sure the bookings were all definitely in place.  Very fortunate as our hamman wasnât confirmed! They booked us a guide for the first morning, who could familiarise us with the medina (as much as is possible in the maze of alleys!).  The guide is   The staff literally;5
Centrally located. Easy access to all subway lines.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Rooms are smaller, but do the job.  Great landing spot if you're looking for a place to stay when you're in New York.;5
Great location with good hotel shuttle to universal studios. Stayed with friends who did the booking. Had a room on the 31st floor. Great room nice and big. Did not like the porter whom I thought was rude and stood around almost demanding a tip. Our room had great views.  Thanks to our friends Sal and Rolly S we enjoyed our stay.;5
This was a very good hotel, it felt quite grand as we drove up to the roundabout. We chatted with the valet who let us take our luggage out and check-in before parking. It was about 10PM when we arrived in the hotel. Our first impression was that it was nice, clean and airy, it looked a little dated but it was charming. The check-in staff on the other hand did not fit the hotel. There was only one attendant at the counter, a rather large mid thirties man. He was slow, disinterested, confused and at one point started talking to two other tenants giving me a copious amount of unwanted time to study the surroundings. We finally got checked in at a low floor. We werenât expecting much considering how disinterested the staff was, but we were surprised at the roominess and how well;5
Here, you have a feeling of a diferente way of life. An authentic, comfortable and nice  location.  We had an amazing stay at this Riad. The Riad kheirdine is one the most authentic Moroccan Riads you can find in Marrakech. The riad is located at the city border of Marrakech and is about an 15 min walk to the Souks and City Center.;5
We are staying here for one night before our very early 5am flight back to Atlanta. This is our third hotel of our week long vacation (Disneyland, San Diego then finally LA) and from check in it has been nothing but impressive! Check in was smooth and our room was ready immediately. The room is large and updated and you really canât hear the planes! What made this stay over the top was our server in the Unity La lounge. We wanted a quick dinner as we had already took back our rental car and we needed to turn in early. Trino was there quickly after sitting down and was hands down the best customer service weâve had the whole trip! He was so accommodating and was so helpful and attentive, he made our 11 year old daughter smile the whole time and even made her a Shirley Temple!;5
Mine and my friends first time in New York.. we had saved for years to go, when we got there we had a miss hap with our cases which wasnât too much hassle for reception to sort out. Then upgraded us to 4th floor. The room was very spacious and looking right out onto the Lincoln centre, bed was massive and comfy we slept very well all week! Cleaner was in everyday freshening the room, location perfect! Check out easy canât fault it at all! Thankyou very much empire hotel;5
My partner and I travelled to Marrakech from San Francisco, CA and had the most exquisite stay at Riad Kheirridine (RK). I cannot recommend this place enough. Every single staff member went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable - from Elena, Arjame, Sarah, and Siham in the front office, to all of the detail-oriented housekeeping staff, and the many excellent servers and employees (Briham, Yasminne, Monnaie (I hope I am spelling his name right!). They truly made us feel right at home, like we were part of the family. See, I even learned all of their names as they are truly memorable people!   Our room (Verveine) was absolutely stunning. You will feel like royalty! Breakfast is delicious and included with your stay and you can take it whenever you wake up (even 12h,;5
"My husband and I spend our 1 week holiday there and all I can say is our stay was excellent; the price is right! The location is so perfect especially for us; it's our first visit in LA; we did not drive, we use bus and subway for transportation and it is very convenient; the bus stop is in front of the hotel and the subway is 3 minutes walk only. Transportation is very convenient; 4 stops and you are in Hollywood walk of fame and next stop Universal studio; restaurant is everywhere as well.The chef named Hugo is outstanding; all employees we meet were friendly also. The only thing is the elevator; too slow... anything else was perfect so thank you and we will stay there again.";5
Arrived late had an easy checkin with an upgraded room. Nice view of city walk. Room was clean and spacious. Bathroom was spotless. Had a vanity that I took advantage of to ready myself in the morning. Lobby area is modern and sleek. I was too tired to enjoy the bar. Maybe next time.;5
I'm not usually one to leave a review but the level of personal service and staff at Riad Kheirredine were beyond anything I've experienced in years of travelling. Difficult not to repeat all the praise already given in the below reviews, which is what drew us to stay here in the first place - but it surpassed my high expectations on every level.  A special mention must go to Yajaira who was managing the Riad the week we were there and did everything possible to make sure we had an outstanding time and even helped me organise a surprise for the girlfriend during the stay. The rest of the staff are a pleasure to chat with and run the Riad with such a hospitable and friendly manner at times it seemed more like returning to a family home than a hotel.    The riad is stunning and;5
I stayed in the hotel for one night whilst in the area on business. It is a higher end hotel but unusually for a Hilton they do not have an executive lounge for Diamonds, but they do give you vouchers to use in the restaurants. Also they don't have a shuttle to Burbank/Bob Hope Airport which was inconvenient. The public areas of the hotel are clean and bright and the room I was allocated was of a good size, with everything clean and in working order and a great bathroom with everything I needed. Overall I would stay in this hotel again.;5
We booked here for the second part of our Morocco trip as we stayed here last year and it was really amazing...  The Riad is now even larger and the new connected area is very decadent indeed. Service again was amazing, breakfast was amazing, our room was amazing and the ambience was amazing.  Furthermore, if you ever want to go somewhere, then somebody will escort you wherever you like which is great. You also get your own Riad mobile phone with pre-populated numbers and so on for if you get lost or just need to book somewhere for a meal at a restaurant.  The staff are all amazing. I wish I could remember their names, but our host (dark haired girl - super helpful and nice), the porter and servers and even the Riad owner was there and she was also very ver nice.  We bought a;5
We stayed at the iconic New Yorker Hotel this past weekend.  You couldn't ask for a better New York experience...ideal location for us to walk to dinner and a show or just around the mid-town/Times Square area. Staff was incredibly accommodating...looking forward to our next visit!;5
We just recently had a four night stay at this hotel and loved it! The staff was friendly and very helpful. If we ever needed anything or had any questions they were all ready to help with a smile! The rooms were clean, but they were small. We did not mind the size of the rooms as we were only in there to sleep anyway. The location was great and very convenient for getting around the city to all the sites and shopping. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again!;5
Beautiful hotel with gorgeous LA views. Just steps from Universal Studios and 3 minute drive to The Hollywood Bowl, Sunset Strip, Melrose Ave and more. Everything was perfectly clean, staff was helpful and hotel dining options were great.;5
This hotel fulfilled all my needs. From comfort, to cleaniless, to bathroom suppliesâ¦ Couldve have gone with a better choice for my LA trip. Thanks Nelson for helping me out, look forward in coming here again in the nearby future. Highly recommend !;5
"Came to this hotel for my stay in NYC this week, as we were going to see Elton John at Madison Square Garden on March 6th.  Couldn't ask for this hotel to be more perfectly located, as we came in on the train from New Jersey, and Penn Station is a very short walk away.  Was also very convenient to have a short walk back to the hotel after the concert, as it let out around 11 PM.  There was a variety of options for food in the immediate area, including the 24-hr Tick Tock Diner, which the hotel has an entry door to right from the lobby.  We got room 2858 (28th floor) and had an incredible city view!  My ONLY complaint is that it's very hard to regulate the temperature of the shower water; the only temperature of the water from our shower was incredibly hot.  That's honestly my";5
Great location. Easy shuttle to and from terminals. Our room with two queen beds was convenient and cost effective for our family size. The food was superb: excellent carne asada and wonderful breakfast buffet. We all had a great sleep (no airplane noise at all). We would definitely stay here again...and eat a lot!;5
Stayed here for 6 nights last summer,and although there were some plumbing problems and our room wasn't ready they made the best arrangements to help us and went out of their way to compensate. Could not have asked for better or more friendly staff :) Front desk manager was amazing !;5
Big compliments to all the staff at the hotel. As a solo traveler safety is on top of my list. From the beginning Pil made me feel safe and welcomed. The atmosphere is very upbeat. The staff is always smiling and friendly. The breakfast staff also add to the over all friendliness of the hotel. Happy to have met many other solo travelers. Very highly recommended to adventurous people.;5
5 minutes from Hammersmith station. Clean and comfortable. Friendly helpful staff. Will definitely stay again. This is a hostel but it was very quiet, close to shops and places to eat. I don't know what the dorms were like but my twin room was fine. It also had a mini shop with a seating area and useful kitchens on each floor.;5
This hotel has a great location. It's within walking distance from Universal Studios. Plenty of parking. Helpful staff. Clean rooms. Definitely worth staying here for those attending the park. Bar staff made sure everyone had a great time.;5
We had booked to stay five nights at the New Yorker as a family - service was faultless from the minute we arrived. (Do make sure if you stay to check out the little museum on the lower ground floor - lovely quirky feature with lots of hotel history!) Our room was prepared quickly as we had arrived earlier than expected and the room itself was perfect for the four of us - much larger than I was expecting. Staff could not have been more helpful - when our flight home was cancelled at short notice and we needed to stay another night, they made sure we were able to keep our room, despite being very busy - hugely appreciated during a very stressful time - thank you, Wyndham New Yorker!;5
Nancy was extremely helpful in booking my reservation and understanding when I mentioned that the rate did not initially meet my budget. She generously provided me with a discount which met my budget and was prompt in booking the reservation. Overall this was a 10/10 booking experience for me because of her!;5
This place maybe is not the most luxury in Manhattan, but it has excellent location, next to the Penn Station, and no more than 1 mile of the most important places to visit in Manhattan,the service is pretty good and the view from some kind of rooms are beautiful. Also they have restaurant with good prices. The hotel was  constructed art deco style that's mean you can enjoy the same style that Empire State Building I will return and I do recommend this hotel.;5
Havenât stayed here for a good few years but I wasnât disappointed. Our room had obviously had a makeover & the en suite was lovely, I donât know if this will be the whole hotel eventually. Very busy due to the marathon but you didnât notice - everything ran smoothly, we were even able to check in early.  Perfectly placed for Waterloo (new station side entrance, very convenient);5
Thank you to Elena and the rest of the team at Riad Kheirredine. An authentic, relaxing and beautiful riad tucked away in a quiet area but easily accessible to most of the tourist attractions.  We were in classic suite Jasmine which was perfect for a family because you have 2 small bedrooms and 2 bathrooms on different floors, aswell as a small sitting area and balcony.  All furnished very tastefully and house keeping come twice a day to do a thorough job and keep everything replenished.  Need to give a quick shout out to the laundry service and hammam/massage which were excellent.  Aside from the lovely surroundings, a major plus of this riad is the fantastic customer service.  They genuinely want you to enjoy yourself.  As first time visitors to Marrakech, we felt safe in;5
The New Yorker was everything I expected it to be....great heritage (lower lobby is a must-see), service (efficient check-in and out), security (have to show keycard in lobby), location (easy access to subways, buses, and taxicabs), within walking distance to many NY tourists attractions. Express elevators was a definite plus.;5
I arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am and was exhausted from traveling and not sleeping all night.  The staff is very organize and immediately arranged to hold my luggage so I could go to the adjoining restaurant for breakfast.  Just before noon, I received a text from the front desk saying I could check in early!  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was a bit dated, but it only enhanced the authenticity of the Art Deco vibe.  The hotel itself has a very classic 1920's energy and the location is incredible.  I was in NYC to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden and I happily wore my high heels for the less than 5 minute walk to the entrance of MSG.;5
Take away the stress and hassle out of flying from  LAX, stay at the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport. Rooms well appointed, spacious and SOUND PROOF. Selection of food, snacks excellent.;5
The hotel is beautiful. The staff and the service was excellent. So courteous and they did what ever hey could to accomafe and help us in every respect. The rooms are very nice and ours overlooked Universal Studios and City Walk. They have a shuttle to take you to the park and City Walk this is the second time I have stayed here and will do it again. The location is great as well;5
"Next to the Lincoln Centre, perfect access to concerts, ballet and plays, and near Natural History Museum, ""The Met"", and Central Park, this great historic hotel is loaded with character. Guests from all over the world add a buzz.";5
The hotel is one block from Penn Station, handy if you are arriving by RailLink from Newark Airport. Steps from Madison Garden and the beginning of the High Line. This Grande Dame from the 1920s has been carefully renovated and updated. We had a view of the Hudson and the glittering lights of the Big City from our window. The staff were welcoming and attentive. The price was just right.;5
This is my fourth visit in less than two years to NYC. The New Yorker for me is the only place I want to stay. Having had an easy but long travel day I arrived around 7.30pm and was greeted by a lovely lady who's name I did not get. We had a pleasant conversation and had told her that this was a gift to myself having had successful treatment for cancer. I asked if they had any upgrades and was delighted to be offered a small suite for a small extra sum that I was more than happy to pay. I was also given a drink voucher to enjoy at The Tick Tock Diner, which I did. The suite was fantastic. Large lounge with a settee and two chairs, a fridge and sink unit, coffee machine, pods water and soft drinks. Large bedroom, comfortable bed, crisp linen and a view of Manhatten with the;5
Amazing location, friendly staff, nicely decorated, everything great.  The only cons are that wifi is extra and mini bar items are expensive, and the bathroom tub was in need of some renovation.  I would definitely stay there again.;5
The staff are excellent - the shuttle operates frequently and my stays have always been spot on. I stayed on my way to India overnight and on the way back also. Teh breakfast buffet was delicious and extensive and the service superb. The 24 hour Starbucks in the lobby is a godsend when you arrive past midnight.;5
I love the Hyatt, and this one didn't disappoint. The location is idea, within walking distance from the airport, or a quick shuttle ride. Room was outstanding, comfortable bed and very good food via room service too. Although I was too tired to use it (on a layover after a long trip), I had a view of the pool from my room and it was huge and uncrowded. I'll make a point of staying here again and using it next time. As usual, service was excellent from every member of the staff.;5
Stayed for 6 nights and got a upgrade to a room with 2 beds which was a great size. Rooms are art deco style with 2 separate robes. Shower was very powerful and relaxing after walking all day. Lots of lifts so no waiting around and security was good too. Location is great for everything. Only thing I would change is to have tea/coffee facilities but would definitely return ð.;5
I rate this hotel about 4.5/5, but i absolutely love it and still talk about!  I stayed with my boyfriend, however my friend and sister were also staying there as well. It's great if your main concern is universal and Hollywood. Its a about a block away from Universal Studios, just have to cross the bridge and the street. Hollywood BLVD with great clubs and tourist attractions are just a 10 min metro away.  No little gas stations or shops outside the hotel though, as it is located right beside the park on the hill so gas stations/pharmacies were a walk down and around a few blocks, with nothing open 24 hours.  Metro was just down the hill very easy to access a little tricky to navigate at first considering we didnt realize there was an underground train (blonde moment)  Wifi in;5
My girlfriend and I kicked off our 10-day Moroccan holiday at Riad Kheirredine and we can safely say that our experience here was the best weâve had in all our years of travel. Prior to booking, we had looked at photos and read other reviews about the beauty of the Riad, the quality of the food, and the convenient location. For all of these factors, the reviews were spot on, and our expectations were either met or exceeded. But what set Riad Kheirredine apart from anything weâve experienced â was the incredible staff.   The staff of Riad Kheirredine truly made us feel like members of the family, and this started weeks before we arrived in Marrakech. Most of our communication was with Sara, who was very quick to respond to our inquiries, and always clear and helpful! From the;5
The Empire Hotel rules when in comes to location, service, decor, and most of all, staff were pleasant and professional.  We had an excellent experience at The Empire Rooftop And Pj Clarkeâs as well! Food was wonderful, service was on point and staff were pleasant. We will definitely return and recommend to anyone visiting NYC!;5
Helpful staff and great amenities. You canât go past the Hilton for a quality stay.  Easy checkin with Hilton Honours everything the family needed for the stay. Close walking distance to the park and universal city.;5
I've now stayed at the Jane 5 or 6 times and it's been impeccable every time. The rooms are tiny but well equipped and are spotlessly clean. Ive always stayed away from hotels with shared bathroom facilites but the bathrooms at the Jane are outstanding, 2 per floor, cleaned several times a day and look as if they were newly installed yesterday they're that well cared for. I've not eaten at the hotel as the food was a little 'fussy' for my taste and a bit on the expensive side, the bar/ballroom is great. The hudson river park is just across the street and makes a great place for a walk downtown;5
Location was perfect, check-in was a breeze, room was super clean and staff was unusually friendly for New York!!!  Gave us a double room with Empire State view on 36th floor...awesome... rooms were actually large...would recommend staying here.;5
We stayed at the Empire for three nights, and found the experience very pleasant.  Every staff person we interacted with, from the doorman to the people at the front desk, and the cleaning staff , was very pleasant and helpful.  We requested a room with a view on a quiet floor, which was accommodated.  The room was on the small side, but very clean and quiet.   We reserved our room on Priceline, and found it to be an excellent value for the money.  The bathroom was small, but workable. The location was great---just across the street from Lincoln Center, and a couple of blocks from Central Park.   The weather was mild, so we didn't have issues with the heating or air conditioner.  Would definitely recommend the Empire Hotel.;5
Close to bargain shops food and drink establishment approx 100 metres away from Madison Square Garden and not too far from Times Square Penn subway station just round the corner. The room was clean and tidy very compact room with very little space for storage besides the wardrobe. Old style bathrooms which provided a lot of character. MacDonalds right across the road for late night eating if you don't want to go to far.;5
Excellent service with the kids and the rest of the family. We stayed here for vacation a tourism. The restaurant it's excellent, the taste of the food is very good, the chef Hugo has an very exceptional service;5
Long weekend in New York with my wife, the hotel is one of the best Ive stayed on. I would recommended to anyone. The terrace bar is beatiful, hotel close to central park, walking distance to time square and a beatiful mall at colombus circle. Great experience all around;5
The room was great it was spacious and comfortable. It was also very clean. The amenities were great. The breakfast they had there was delicious. Perfect hotel if you are going to universal studios. Bed was very comfortable;5
Excellent service, great location, room service is fast and tasty, spacious rooms, if youâre staying in New York this needs to be your hotel. Neida in the front desk is incredible, she took great care of us during our stay, big thank you to her!;5
All of the staff were fantastic to deal with especially Luis at the front desk. He helped out tremendously when we had an issue with our credit card. He called the museum staff and explained the situation. Canât thank him enough .;5
I opted to host a loved ones surprise engagement party here and it was the best decision I ever made!  Tyler and Michael from the Empire Hotel staff were so accommodating and incredibly helpful in catering to our needs and helping everything run smoothly.  We had the party on a crisp May evening but, with the option of having the party in the enclosed pool deck we got to still witness the glitz, glam and magic of the city without losing the view or having to brave the cold.  The food was great, came out warm, displayed boardroom style and drinks were strong.  The bartenders were incredibly gracious and friendly.  The music was not so loud that it overpowered casual conversation but, it was loud enough to give the party a lively pulse.  I would most definitely go back and host;5
One night stay but great. Hotel staff Pil is funny and helpful. Rooms are very clean and big. Breakfast is open late which is good for night people. Happy to have decided to stay at the hotel. Parking is $30 dollars which is the only bad part, should be included. Everything else is really good.;5
This hotel is in a fantastic location and close to the Hollywood hills there are plenty of restaurants just a short ride away. We stayed for 3 nights the rooms are lovely bright and airy and very clean, the bathroom is a little tired but didnât make any difference. The pool area is lovely very well kept and very peaceful. The breakfast has a good selection and all very fresh the omelets  that are made fresh are amazing too. This hotel is definitely a must and would definitely stay here again.;5
Location can't be beat. Great value for those travelling alone. Service was the quality of a 3 or 4 star hotel. Cafe was excellent. The rooms are of course very small but that is to be expected. Would definitely stay here again.;5
We make lots of 2-3 day NY trips over the course of the year and need to stay in and around mid-town. SInce we take the Amrtak in, the New Yorker is great because its across the street from Penn. It also had VERY reasonably priced large suites AND the Tic Toc diner (24/7 when we aren't in the middle of COVID) is great for meals. Also, its a quick trip to all the theatrical stuff we need to do (rehearsals, auditions, training, etc.) and with the A Train RIGHT there, we can easily shoot uptown to see our son in Washington Heights. So very convenient, big rooms, good food, easy access to theatrical stuff all at a terrific price makes it our go to.;5
Me and my boyfriend went for a city break to New York this Hotel was in a great location literally a ten minute walk from time square. Has lovely views and great staff, a good checking out time and it's fairly priced. If we return to newyork we would Definitely chose this hotel to stay at again.;5
Had a fab time here. Great staff and location was perfect for us. Thanks for your hospitality! This is our 3rd time visiting the big apple as we love it so much. This will definitely be our hotel of choice.;5
I've been at the Empire Hotel for a week for business and it was great the people were kind and and welcoming. i will definitely recommend this hotel for tourists or fellow new yorkers looking for a high quality and affordable hotel;5
After reading mixed reviews of the hotel my expectations were low, just in case it was as bad as some reviews make it seem. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were very clean and comfy, great location to get out of New York's fast pace! The subway and bus stop was a pleasant and safe 3 block walk. The only complaint I would have is the cable issue. If you are looking to watch a lot of TV on your vacation, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, but if you are looking for a GREAT deal on a great room in a great location, this place should serve you as good as it did us!!!;5
Great service and location.   We went by train and the hotel was across the street.  We were able to walk to hotel.  The hotel was also in close proximity to Macy's, Time Square, Broadway, etc.We were located right down town.  The security was;5
I arrived a few hours to rooms being ready  And was happy that they let me  precheck in and have my car parked & my bags stored so I could go to the Universal Studios Theme Park  They have a shuttle that runs approximately ever 20 mins until about 11pm  ( I recommend taking the shuttle as it is a bit of a hike uphill to the park)  The shuttle drops you very close to the park entrance right beside Johnnie Rockets on Universal CityWalk   Hotel room is great I had an awesome view of the park & the pool and hot tub area is great cabanas are available if you wish and there is a poolside snack & beverage bar.  My only complaint is when I arrived the lady asked for my phone number so they could text me when my room was ready   Which they never did and after driving all morning from San;5
Riad Kheirredine is truly a hidden gem in Marrakech. From the moment I made the reservation, the staff, Sara in particular, provided us with 5 star customer service. Sara offered to have a meal prepared for us upon our arrival and not only was the food delicious, the presentation and service was as it would be from a fine dining restaurant. Antonio made sure to greet us, along with Sara, as we checked in and made sure that we knew he was there to make sure we had an amazing stay and upgraded us to the best suite on the premises. What a surprise! Sara took us on a tour of the beautiful Riad ensuring that we knew our way around and all they had to offer. The suite was gorgeously detailed in Moroccan dÃ©cor and housekeeping had beautiful pastries and fruit displayed for our;5
What a wonderful home of calm in the midst of Marrakech! From the personal greeting at the airport, to breakfast on the terrace and a phone in case you get lost, this Riad cares so much about their guests. Our room had such attention to detail (with beautiful detailed curtains) and the staff were always on hand to answer any questions. We had a holiday we won't forget and would love to return to Riad Kheirredine!;5
Breakfast was amazingly chilled and relaxing quiet friendly people all around great out of the blue trip and experience...  The place itself is decorated with a larger than life and The place is clean. would love to come back;5
In January 2018, I took my daughter to NYC to audition for college theatre programs. The Empire was the perfect choice for location right near Juilliard and just a quick subway ride uptown to visit Columbia. Our room was spacious, clean and quiet, with complimentary coffee and tea. Breakfast at Ed's Chowder House before the audition was quick, delicious and affordable and the person in charge that morning made sure our dairy-free requests were followed perfectly. The Rooftop Bar was so good that we visited it twice in one day! And the front desk staff was incredibly helpful, especially Chris, who checked us out. Oh and we left our bags with the concierge after checkout for a few hours, also handled perfectly. We are coming back for sure!!;5
Not only is the hotel in an awesome location - across from Lincoln Center - but it is just a terrific hotel. The people who work there are incredibly nice, especially Brandon. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.;5
We had a wonderful stay in New Yorker  Wyndham. The rooms are clean the location is great. Would stay at this hotel again!!;5
Booked the corner panorama view suite overlooking Universal Studios. Loved how I used the app to check in, used it as my key and to check out. Great views and great location for a Universal trip. Can't wait to go back.;5
Charming 1930 hotel with excellent, friendly staff!  Located in midtown Manhattan walking distance to MSG and Time Square.   Rooms are small but very comfortable!  Security is great your not going to get on the elevator without showing your room key.  Late in the evening if you are sitting in the lobby you will be asked to show your room key.  I am happy to be a repeat customer.;5
Nice hotel, great view from the room, location was perfect for Lincoln Center.  Great view from the rooftop bar.  Would be happy to make this my home away from home in New York City.  Can't wait to go back.;5
We stay here about once a month or so and have always had a great experience. Front desk team is first rate! To the point where they recognize me at check-in and welcome us back. Always been given rooms that are huge by NYC standards. And - the walls are thick so we aren't disturbed by neighbors or hallway activity - a rare benefit in NYC! Special shout out to Michael, the manager, who remembers us and greets us with a smile. Mohammed and Krystal went extra mile - even calling up to the room to make sure the view and accommodations were to our liking. Security at the hotel is present without being intrusive. The hotel is in a busy area so it's nice to know security is monitoring the lobby to ensure guests have an enjoyable experience. The lobby is busy with lots of energy;5
Wonderful hotel with great service!! Would honestly stay here again just for the service alone. Our concierge Yuri did a great job informing us on all of the best places to go in NYC. This was our first time in NYC so we didn't know where to even begin. He gave us some great recommendations and was able to make this trip an unforgettable one!! Lila at the front desk was also very helpful and did a great job with her customer service skills. You can tell she genuinely cared about making all of the guests have an enjoyable experience.Rooms were very clean and and had a comfortable feel to it. Will definitely stay here again next visit to NYC!!;5
Three of us went to NYC for a long weekend and had a Metro View room. Initially, the room given to us had a view though not entirely what we had been hoping for, but the hotel was very full that night. They offered to move us to another room for the 2nd through 4th nights and held our luggage for us while we enjoyed the city. Our new room was fantastic. I could lay in bed and see the Empire State Building! The room was spotless. The beds were very comfortable and our room was a very comfortable size, especially for NYC. We interacted with many of the staff during our stay and they were all so friendly and accommodating. We ate in two of the restaurants and the food was very good. The location is terrific with easy access to the subway, LIRR or Amtrak and also within walking;5
"It's all been said before on TA but I'd like to add a couple of things:  1: There was no slippers in the room. When we asked, the response implied that this is not a standard requirement, no they did not have any slippers.  My wife likes a nice slipper, either at home or when in a hotel, but fair enough, I guess she'll get used to cold feet on the cold floor in the room; Marrakech was unseasonably cool when we were there. No biggie. Then there was a knock on the door and there was one of the team with not one, but three pairs of what looked like brand new Morrocan style leather slippers. Wow, you can't really beat that for service can you?  2. I mentioned that we were celebrating out 10th wedding anniversary. We were given not just a bottle of fizz or some roses but BOTH a";5
Love staying at the Ameritania when attending events in the Carnegie Hall/54 Below area. Rooms are fairly small, but cozy and the beds are very comfortable. Also love the showers and bathrooms-beautiful!;5
The New Yorker is in a good location for subway or other transportation. The staff were outstandingly friendly and helpful. Good security at the elevators (you can't go in without a room key). The value was great. Also the Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel has amazingly delicious food. I recommend the grilled salmon dinner. Highly recommended for families or groups!;5
This hotel is located across the street from Universal Studios Hollywood.  It has a wonderful restaurant where my family and I ate the delicious buffet breakfast each morning before heading to Universal Studios.  The lounge is nice too if you want to enjoy an afternoon drink and appetizer or meal.  We spent a few hours outside at the pool and hot tub.  We watched the Universal Studios fireworks on New Years Eve from our hotel room.  We had a great experience at this hotel, I highly recommend it!;5
Awesome night for me and my wife we have a good time and the staff at the empire are the best and they help me we everything and I canât wait to return again and have a again awesome time in the awesome hotel;5
I highly recommend Premier Inn County Hall.  The staff are friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble.  The food was delicious and very good value.  The bedroom had recently been refurbished to the highest standard.  It was a most enjoyable stay and my thanks go to the staff for their dedication, patience and hard work to make guests comfortable over the Christmas period.;5
The hotel was in a great location close to many restaurants and stores. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were very clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York.;5
We really enjoyed our stay! room was comfortable and big, the staff available and nice to us at any time, the location was perfect! very cozy hotel room and amazing rooftop. Sad for not trying the pool for the weather but still a very enjoyable journey.  Hope to come back soon;5
Walked in to the Hollywood hotel to a very welcoming and friendly environment. The hotel has taken all precautions to assure the safety and well being of guest.  As we go back to what the new normal will be the friendly staff member Pil was more than reassuring and informative of whatâs around the hotel. Such as  Restaurant that deliver and the hotel and pool which is still open to guest.  Overall met and exceeded my expectations. Please everyone stay safe and healthy.;5
I was treated so well there, I would probably choose to stay here if I had business within 50 miles of the Hotel, every single staff person was above excellent. Location to Universal Studios was bar far the best location, we walked, and the restraunt is by far my FAVORITE on the planet - I am headed over to write a review on them next.  Again - absolute only place to stay if your visiting Universal Studios - actually we had booked it for 1 night of our vacation - ended up extending our stay 2 more nights just because we felt like Kings, Queens and a Prince.;5
I organization were scheduled for a very large event this year in New York. Due to the world events of the coronavirus everything was brought to a screaming halt. We've stayed with the New Yorker for every visit to NYC for the last 20 years because of their hospitality. We will continue to stay for the following 20. Their understanding of the events of 2020 were exceptional. I personally want to thank Neida and her team for the exceptional customer service provided to myself and my team.    Best wishes,;5
The New Yorker hotel is an icon for a reason. It is perfectly situated at Herald Square with a subway station at each corner of the hotel for easy access to the rest of the city. There are restaurants galore, including a McDonalds, Starbucks, and great bagel shop right across the street, which was perfect t for our kids. Macyâs Herald Square and much more shopping is a mere two blocks and the Empire State Building is also just two blocks away. On top of being perfectly located, itâs one of few hotels in Manhattan offering a family size suite, large enough to sleep 6, at an affordable price. As two moms bringing our two boys to the city, we appreciated the high level of security at the hotel. The hotel was accommodating at every turn, permitting early check-in, giving us a great;5
Every aspect of this hotel was perfect for our purposes. I originally made the booking from UK by phone. It was not straightforward as I needed to make 3 separate reservations over a 12 day period. The lady was very accommodating. We were given an upgrade and Driss kindly reserved the same room to provide us with continuity . It is perfectly located for access to train station and Times Square.;5
Everything was great, staff was super friendly and there is a rooftop bar which is really nice with a great view. :) Will definitely recommend it to friends and would stay there again. Perfect location, great value for money;5
Was in town for a quick business trip at the beginning of November....the location of the hotel was perfect for getting around the city and many restaurants nearby. Rooms were comfortable and clean...and had great drinks and conversation at the lobby bar of the hotel in the evening...including with Mor who really made sure to make me feel comfortable and well attended to. Thanks again for the great service and will definitely stay here again on my next trip to nyc!;5
Can't wait to come back here again, amazing hotel, amazing location and amazing staff. Jeff on the door is a credit to the hotel and will do anything for you, as well as Julian. Javier and Gina behind the bar were incredible to us and made our evenings very enjoyable. Couldn't recommend the hotel enough. Thank you!;5
a beautiful riad about 10 minutes from the main square of jemma el fna. the place is beautifully appointed and the pool on the terrace is a perfect place to relax in the warm weather. elana checked us in and handled everything perfectly. overall the service was great , but we did at times find a disconnect with the staff. sometimes we would order and it was brought right away , other times, it would take two request , or a half hour. the room was beautiful but we felt the bathroom was small/tight.  the food is great, and the Italian was a welcome break from tagine. I will say this about the team we had a problem on a day trip to imlil, communication with our driver.and they paid for our dinner at a local restaurant ,fondouk, review later. overall a terrific experience.;5
Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Empire Hotel.  Nick at the check in was extremely helpful as we arrived running late and had to check in quickly to get to our play on time.  It wasn't just any play, my fiance was the playwright and it was opening in the Village in less than an hour!  Nick not only bent over backwards to help us check in quickly but when we returned after the play, there was a congratulatory bottle of champagne waiting for us on ice in our room!  What a surprise!  We popped the cork and celebrated while we watched the beautiful view from our window, city lights and fountains sparkling on Lincoln Center plaza!  Thank you Empire Hotel staff for a truly memorable night!;5
I walked past this hotel a million times when I lived in the city. I never realized how amazing the location is. Youâre a few blocks from Columbus Circle and our room over looked Lincoln Center! You could see the Chagall paintings at night in the opera house. Thereâs a Starbucks about 50 feet from the entrance. The room was really clean and well set up. Only gripe is the lighting in the bathroom was a bit dim butâ¦Louis at the front desk really went above and beyond for us.;5
Hotel was clean, cost effective and friendly staff. Close proximity to Madison Square garden and multiple food options.   Historical significance of hotel is documented on the floor below the lobby. Very interesting and informative.   I would definitely stay again.;5
Lovely view airport without airport noise.  Exceptional number of outlets, including USB charging outlets.  Well lit and good mirrors for getting ready for a night out.  Excellent water pressure and choice of overhead shower or handheld sprayer.;5
"The Empire is in a great location with plenty to do in the Lincoln Center area; keep checking for specials, the Rooftop lounge is really nice and a happening place, and the front desk staff, esp Marilyn, were very helpful and great";5
This hotel is an easy Uber to Santa Monica, about 20 minutes which makes a day at the beach before you fly achievable.  There are plenty of shuttles to and from the hotel and LAX.  BUT the best part, the beds are so so so comfortable, the rooms are big, the staff at the hotel were great and very helpful.  The gym has a greta view of the runway, and the pool, even though outside, is actually heated properly and is big.;5
I have booked for two nights in this riad really comfortable with a good and comfortable rooms, the personal at the hotel really helpful and they were always here for any concern. I really recommend this hotel for a  stay;5
Great location to everything in walking distance Central Park, Time square, 5th Ave Hotel is clean and the bellman Jeff is the best. Jeff looks after you and takes care of everything from bags to cars to a friendly conversation. Jeff is the only reason I would go back there. Bar is only open at limited times. There breakfast is over priced for food sitting on warmers all morning.The bartender was very friendly. From the time we walked in the doors at hotel it was Jeff that provided all the service for us.Anything we needed and also directions Jeff was always there.The hotel doesn't have a restaurant and the room are very small but the location is great Thak you Jeff for making our stay remarkable;5
Extremely nice hotel with exceptionally clean rooms and very friendly staff. Ideal location for my visit. The free full breakfast was a plus. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my family members and friends.;5
We are traveling as a family of 4 with two children aged 6 and 7 We stayed here for two nights so we could visit Universal Studios. Check in was fast and they were incredibly helpful in providing information on getting to the Metro, buying tickets etc. We had a corner room on the 8th floor, and when we opened the sheer curtains, we overlooked Universal and could see Hogwarts castle ! The kids went wild!  We got room service our first night, pizza was hot, lots of topping and delicious. The bathroom is a great size, beds were comfortable. We caught the shuttle around 7.15 the next morning for universal. It's about a 5 minute ride. We actually left the park around 3pm and came back to the hotel ( via the shuttle) and went to the pool and spa area for a couple of hours. Great space;5
We went down to have breakfast that was provided by the hotel. Not a typical continental breakfast. There was a nice selection of the usual cereal, fruit, begals etc., but they also offered freshly made waffles and omelettes, we were greeted by Hugo who was very friendly. I chose my omelette fillings and he made an excellent omelet. The atmosphere was nice and it was a very nice start to our day. Thank you Hugo!;5
Went there and had a wonderful experience. Sophy was so nice and was able to accommodate my boyfriend and I. Very nice room, was small but very cozy. Stayed here because hotel was on gossip girl but definitely a nice stay.  Will return!;5
Great place to stay in LA.   Lovely staff, free breakfast and nice pool area.  Rooms were spotless and spacious.  Already planning our next trip ðð  Hotel is close to everything you need in LA. I would highly reccomend using uber to get around if you do not drive.;5
If you're like me, you've read approximately 921 reviews of Riads trying to find the best one for your money. Stop looking. This is it. There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been written, except to say that my fiance and I have travelled extensively throughout the world and both agree that the treatment we received at this Riad is by far the best customer service we've experienced anywhere. During our stay in Morocco, we stayed at three other hotels and were frankly spoiled by this Riad because no subsequent hotel could quite live up to the standard of service we experienced immediately upon our arrival. Free wifi...free water/tea/coffee...a cellphone...a manager who anticipates your needs even before you do...seriously, do yourself a favor.;5
paid a little more for a junior suite and was not disappointedthere was a minor issue with the sink drain that was attended to promptly after bringing it to management's attentionconcierge was very helpful in selecting local restaurants;5
This is my second visit to the hotel. Went for a girls weekend and had reserved a jr. king suite for the weekend.  When I checked in, they upgraded us to a corner suite which was very roomy!  We were in Rm 419 which looked out across to Lincoln Center and to the small park across the street on 63rd as well. Hotel was very clean.  Checking in and out, the assistance was terrific.  They were quick to come open up the sofa bed and use an additional foam mattress on top of the mattress that is already on the bed.  The king bed was very comfortable and I was lovin the firmer mattress after walking all day.  We happened to be in the room one morning when housekeeping came by and noticed that they change the sheets (bottom and top) EVERY DAY!  Clean sheets everyday was great!  This;5
Amazing service with Mohammed and beautiful and clean room. The room have a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. The People who work their are so nice and give a great service. Best hotel with a great worker Mohammed.;5
The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   The hotel is only minutes from the train station, a few blocks from Broadway and shopping, and of course many restaurants as well as fast food.  We felt very safe at the hotel.  No one has access to the elevators without showing the room key. The mattress on my bed was SO comfortable. The room was not huge, but sufficient, and very clean.  The on-site Tick Tock Diner had delicious food, with very generous portions, and not extremely expensive. We had breakfast and lunch there.  We had dinner at The Trattoria Bianca.  It was fairly priced, and our food was delicious. We started with the Gorgonzola fondue. It was very generous with fresh vegetables and toasted garlic bread. Delicious!  I had the lamb shank, which melted in my mouth!;5
Stayed one week in this very fine raid in Marrakesh at the end of April. Everyone from the owners to the staff are so friendly and helpful to all their guests, so you feel like being part of a big family. The neighborhood have some nice shops such as the old lady who sell homemade bread and Mohammeds shop with handmade blankets etc. in fine quality. All in all a fantastic stay in this calm and relaxing oasis where one can withdraw to after a exciting day in the busy Marrakesh.;5
Great hotel, nice location and super service. Special thanks to ShardÃ© ...our employee of the month :-). She was a good listener, she understood our expectations , and she not only met them but arrange also to exceed them. We definitely recommend this hotel and we will come back for our next NY city trip.;5
Had such an amazing stay from the moment we walked into Riad Kheirredine! Highly, highly recommend if you're looking to stay in a more unique environment (inside the Medina) with 5 star hospitality. The entire staff was outstanding from beginning to end and super accommodating. Staying inside the Medina walls can be intimidating, but the staff made us feel 100% safe and gave us all the inside tips of what to avoid/be aware of + even gave us a cell phone to use if we ever got lost or needed someone to come pick us up!! Free breakfast and laundry everyday was a such plus as well! Also highly recommend the hamman & spa at the Riad -- It's much cleaner/nicer than other public hammans and the massages were incredible! Would definitely stay again!;5
Ali was very helpful during my checking and he helped me with my chromecast. I enjoyed the breakfast as well and the customer service. The beds are comfortable and thereâs places nearby to eat. The housekeeping is very good;5
This is one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed at in NYC. Much nicer than any of the major chain hotels! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Location is excellent, rooms are a good size and bed is quite comfortable.;5
The stay was excellent.  Jeff at the front door/lobby stood out.  He was very helpful, friendly and always asking how he could help.  The location is very convenient for my purposes.  This is the second time I have stayed in the last month and will be staying frequently. Only suggestion would be to have coffee available earlier than 6AM as I am up early.;5
Lovely quaint hotel near to Times Square and all the Broadway shows. Lovely staff very helpful. Bed comfy. Towels changed when required. Room serviced daily. A bit dated but brought character to the place.;5
The Ameritania is really conveniently located for access to anywhere in Manhattan. Subway is a few blocks away but we walked almost everywhere anyway. Staff were extremely polite and helpful. The bed was more comfortable than my own at home, I wanted to take it home with me! Only downside for me was a noisy ventilation stack outside the window that roared and rumbled away all night, but if you are used to wearing earplugs when travelling that won't be an issue.   Nice modern shower room with decent toiletries too.  Really, an excellent choice and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.;5
Booked the Empire Hotel as a surprise anniversary getaway for my wife. From check in to check the hotel staff was gracious, helpful and accommodating. Our room was spotless, spacious and provided a killer view of the fountains at Lincoln Center, and surrounding city.   The hotel management was particularly helpful in assisting me with preplanning the surprise aspect of the trip. Well above and beyond my expectations.   The rooftop pool and sundeck provided a rare treat of scenic serenity amid the bustling metropolis. Overall, just an outstanding trip. We look forward to returning for future stays.;5
Nicole, who worked at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. She had a great personality and remembered who I was when I returned. She made me feel welcome and very much at home. I really appreciate that.;5
Everything about this hotel is absolutely first class! From our first contact we felt that they would do everything they could to make our stay with them perfect.   Our room was great, we had a beautiful breakfast each morning, the rooftop pool and loungers were very relaxing, we had delicious dinners and drinks prepared for us and the whole hotel is beautiful, tranquil and spotlessly clean.  However, what made this the best hotel we've experienced was the amazing dedication of all the staff.  Our plans changed several times (due to Covid 19) but these changes were simply accommodated so before we arrived we were already impressed by their caring attitude.  Everyone at the hotel was genuinely interested in doing whatever they could to enhance our stay. They gave us great advice;5
We loved our stay at Riad Kheirredine. The staff was absolutely wonderfu. Everyone was so attentive and helpful. Even before our stay, they helped to organize activities for us and helped with recommendations. The breakfasts were fresh and delicious. We loved sitting on the roof and overlooking the city. The pool is great for a dip on a hot day. We loved how each room was different and unique with their own character. Every corner in the hotel is a new chic surprise, and there are so many photo-ops within the hotel. It is super instagramable in nearly every spot. I would definitely recommend this hotel!;5
"The Riad Kherirredine will go down in our traveling history as a dream come true.  Our experience at this achingly beautiful Riad made our trip to Marrakech what it was.  From the moment we landed, they took care of everything.   The driver from the Riad met us outside of the terminal, and then it was on to our âhomeâ for the next three nights.  When we reached our destination, we were met by Ishmael, who told us ""what's what.""  He brought us to a cushioned lounge where he served their welcoming mint tea, in addition to a plate of dried dates and apricots.  The staff here is ready and willing to do anything to accommodate you and treat you like treasured royalty.   After we were given our introduction to the Riad, and shown our rooms, it was time to take a first walk through the";5
Excellent hotel. All the staff I came in contact with were extremely helpful, Katherine quinonez, director of front office who assisted my wife and l when we were obliged to move from a hotel we considered unsuitable.  I feel I must mention four other members of staff who made our staff so memorable, Said,Gyina,Jeff andYassir.  I would no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any of my friends, family etc. Rooms excellent, cleanliness excellent. The only drawback in my opinion, no tea making facilities in room.;5
This is a huge hotel that dates back to the 1930s. It is clean and friendly. The suites are so large that some have a dining room table for 6. The pull out sofa beds are surprisingly comfortable. The Tick Tock Diner in the lobby has a fun menu. The hotel is easily accessible by train from Newark and JFK. We always stay at the New Yorker for family weekend getaways.;5
Getting into LAX late at night continuing my travels  early the next day I only overnight at this wonderful hotel.  The few hours spent there was enough to realize how beautiful of a place this is. True to the Regency brand  associated with this property anyone who is familiar or a loyal member already knows what Iâm talking about. To those unfamiliar with this hotel chain I can rest assured you that the level of quality at any âRegency â tier is exactly the same regardless of  place as I previously stayed at other worldwide âRegency â hotel categories and yes  you already know your expectations will be fulfilled. The service is impeccable, the lobby very inviting with warm colors in a very modern minimalistic style speaks so LA: convenient, practical 21st century.  The rooms;5
"We had the good fortune of having this hotel included in our BCS package.  We did not know the treat that awaited us.  From the very first moment we we treated as long-awaited family members.  The view is wonderful, the rooms are fantastic, the service is second to none.  Right down the street (wlking distance) is the Universal ""party town"", very convenient for a little off-site entertainment...";5
We stayed here whilst visiting the big apple for three days, the hotel is excellent and has very friendly staff. All the door staff were very helpful , friendly and knowledgeable especially Jeff who helped us during our stay and with our onward journey, there was also another member who helped us by providing us with a map and directions to make our day a enjoyable one!  The hotel is very modern, clean and tidy. The rooms are spacious with all the facilities apart from wifi, but you can add this onto your room for $10 dollars a day for two devices. Wifi is free if you are in the lobby. The reception staff were just as helpful and check in and out was made as easy as possible.   It's location is spot on too. You are right in yeh middle off Times Square and only a five minutes;5
Spent 4 nights at the Empire with my husband on our honeymoon. Glad we didn't book the basic room - we overheard someone yelling at the lady on reception that he had never seen such a small room and with a view of a brick wall! Our room was wonderful, everything you need and a good view. Great location for exploring Manhattan and the subway is a stones throw from the hotel and a 5 minute walk to the nearest branch of Whole Foods for breakfast and supplies. The cocktail bar looked good but we didn't get chance to try it. Overall, good value for Manhattan and great location but don't book the tiny rooms, pay more for a better room!;5
I stayed her for business but would stay here for a personal trip as well. It's in a great location close to Central Park which made for great walks during my down time. I had a SUPER view of Lincoln Center as well.  I was upgraded to a suite when I arrived and it was HUGE. I had an amazing sitting area with couch, sitting table and chairs and the bedroom had a king bed and closet and plenty of room.;5
We have just returned from our trip to Marrakech.  Staying at this Riad was absolutely the highlight of our stay.  It's a little oasis of beauty and service in crazy Marrakech.  I am having a hard time putting into words how wonderful this hotel was.  The riad was absolutely beautiful, no details were missed.  What makes it so special, however, is the people who run it.  They take customer service and genuine kindness to the next level.  For example, we had booked to eat at the riad on our first night.  The dinner was fantastic. At the end, all the lights went out (we were eating on the terrace), and the staff came out singing with a birthday cake.  I asked my fiance if he had told them my birthday was the following day, and he promised he had not.  Later on I asked, and they;5
"My husband booked a 4 night stay here for my birthday on 21st. May The whole stay was just perfect: the staff are all brilliant, so polite and can't do enough to make your stay great. I echo the other reviews about the phone, the escorts, the food, the immaculate cleaning, the endless water; the Italian meal was the highlight for me but Morrocan was great too! They gave me the most delicious chocolate cake with candles and 3 of the waiters sang to me. It was so sweet. We had the Fleur D'Orange suite which was large and entirely white with a fab rain shower, twin basins and separate toilet. The cleaning staff were superb. I could go on and on. I really loved it and the terraces and plunge pool were lovely to relax in after walking miles in the market and souks. Breakfast is";5
This is our second trip to the Hollywood Hotel, it was a very pleasant stay and good value for money , great location and convenient for LA.  The rooms are functional and clean, but look at the comparisons sites for the the best value.  Worthy of a mention was the very pleasant receptionist Gisel, who could not be more helpful and charming, a credit to the hotel. If there was an award for employee of the month she should get it.   Hope this helps future travellers to this hotel;5
Really enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker, I've visited many hotels before but this one has been the cleanest of all. Also the staff was really helpful since we got there, I have no complaints about this hotel or my stay.;5
I had been wary after reading online comments but found mystery to be trouble free and everyone generally helpful.  I did travel with a friend, however, and the AC in his room did not work and was not fixed during our visit. Fortunately it was cool and he opened the window and that worked for him.  It would not have worked for me as the street noise would have been a problem.  Otherwise, the location is great as we were there for the opera which is right across the street.  Their dining room, The Chowder House,  has very good food but you need to allow a 1 1/2-2 hr. window if you are going to the theater.  They have a bar upstairs but it is for young people who like loud music.  The bar in the lobby is quieter.   The rooms are fairly small and the accommodations along with them;5
We stayed 5 nights in mid-June 2017 at Riad Kheirredine in Marrakesh.  Conclusion: With hundreds of Riads in the Medina to choose from they have to make a difference to stand out. Riad Kheirredine succeeds with oriental hospitality and luxury paired with an outstanding service.   Arrival: Transfer from the airport was arranged by the Riad. The car journey took 15 minutes and ended at a small square in the Medina. The nearest point to the Riad a car could reach. Here transportation changed. 2 employees from the Riad unloaded our luggage on a trolley and disappeared into the maze of the Medina with us in tow. However, it took only a few minutes through labyrinthine alleys to reach the Riad. It sits at the end of an even narrower alleyway. There is just a non-descript door that;5
"Amazing drinks and service! Victor the bartender was my favorite :) so nice and spontaneous. Best drinks made by him. I definitely recommend to come to the bar when heâs working wonât regret it! Coming back soon ;)";5
From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out, we felt we were the only guests there.  We were spoiled by the staff, breakfast, view of the courtyard and amazing pool.  We left a tip for housecleaning because we needed more toiletries, and they left us a sweet note.  Each day we left a tip, we would find special things that had been done, folded towels in form, better toiletries, bed turn down, etc.  The staff takes pride in every inch of this hotel and it shows.;5
We have now stayed at the Empire about 8 times over the last six years.  We simply love it there.  The location is unbeatable.  Everything is within reach, at the same time, it is not a terribly loud spot despite being bordered by Lincoln Center and Broadway.  It is rather calm, in fact.  The subway entrance is right across the street, 'minimal exposure if you need to get in there in bad weather.  The building is older, which means it was not built with the intention of squeezing you on square footage.  They are comfortable in that way, but not huge, which makes it affordable.   The rooms also begin on the fourth floor, so you get some reprieve from whatever the noise level may be outside.  And of course, half the rooms have an incredible view of Lincoln Center.  The lobby is;5
"Hugo is an awesome cook at the restaurant who made my breakfast super fast and made it taste great. He also greets everyone at the door with a kind ""good morning"" welcoming everyone into the restaurant. Hugo is what made my stay at the Hollywood hotel a pleasurable one.";5
After recently staying at this Riad for five nights it is no surprise that it has so many glowing reviews with each one so accurate and well deserved! Staying at Riad Kheirredine is like staying with family - the service offered is so friendly, genuine and personal. This is what truly makes this Riad stand out.   Riad Kheirredine will send a driver to collect you at the airport. We had a little mix up with the time we said we would be arriving, but when we landed we phoned the Riad and the driver was there within 5 minutes. From therein we were completely catered for. The airport drop off is a 5-10 minute walk to the Riad door, along the windy streets of the medina where your luggage will be transported by a friendly member of staff. Walking into the Riad is like a haven - the;5
I travelled with a group of 8 girls. Marrakech was our first stop and Riad Kheirredine was the perfect beginning to an amazing trip in Morocco. Th Riad is absolutely stunning and well located as others have noted (also smells amazing...I ended up buying the fragrance they use throughout the Riad to take home with me to remind me of my time in Marrakech). What really made our stay however was the service. I couldn't have asked for a more welcoming and friendly staff...they made us feel like we where family. It started even before we arrived with the prompt and patient replies to my emails that I received from Elena in response to my numerous emails with questions, changes in schedules, etc. As others have already noted they provide you with a cell phone during your stay, walk to;5
Amazing and beautiful hotel. We needed a place that was close to Universal Studios as my hubby and I were only there for one day. We really only saw our room, but for being the cheapest room there, it was incredible. It was HUGE and the view looked over the park at night, which was lovely, especially the Hogwarts Castle. The staff, for the most part was very helpful. Would absolutely recommend. A quick 5 minute walk to the park, but shuttles are provided.;5
I stayed here during the Christmas Holidays, I know a little late to review but I really wanted to say what a great experience I had at the hotel. Check in was efficient and easy, the room wasn't quite ready so they stored our bags. I loved the history and character of the rooms and lobby and the hotel itself was in a fantastic location to explore Manhattan.;5
The Hilton at Universal was absolutely fantastic!  The staff was wonderful and very helpful.  They were very willing to help in any way possible.  The location is great.   The food was excellent and the service superb.  My only issue was the cost of parking.  As a Diamond Hilton Honors Club Member, at many other Hilton's the parking fee is waived.  This hotel did not waive the daily $28/day parking fee. Otherwise a very awesome stay.;5
Excellent family hotel, ideal location for seeing the sights on foot and close to so many transport links. Rooms so modern, Excellent views of the city, room & bathroom size absolutely massive, ideal for chilling at night watching a movie after a long day sightseeing. Recommended the dinner & breakfast deal saves a lot of money & kids eat free with a paying adult for breakfast such a great saving. So much choice at breakfast. Staff were so helpful in the hotel. Would definitely return.;5
Courteous front desk greetings, extra washcloths/soap quickly received, and very willing to store luggage/request cars. Jeff, Tiffany, and several others were beyond helpful during our September girls' trip the weekend after Labor Day. We arrived before check in and were able to store our bags with no stress. The room was spacious enough for 4 travelers, and we slept great each night. The shower with two nozzles took some getting used to, but we really enjoyed our stay. The only slight issue was that it wasn't quite as close to our Broadway theaters as we had hoped, but that was on us for not researching. (Still walkable, just not right with the theaters.) We would definitely stay again!;5
We went to this hotel because we had a concert at Lincoln Center and it was right across. The location could not be better. Room was very comfortable and clean. Drinks at the Lobby bar were great.  Our daughter loved finding out we stayed at Chuckâs hotel from Gossip Girls. We gave her a room key.;5
The LAX Hyatt on Century Blvd is a very nice hotel, with extremely close and convenient access to LAX. The shuttles to LAX run every 10 mins or so.  Room is aesthetic, distraction free, and quiet.  Gym on the Penthouse level has great western and northern views. Overall a 5 star experience.;5
From valet parking, to the bell's man, to registration and room service this hotel exceeded my expectations. I generally strongly dislike going into LA and the Universal area for work or play because the hotels are one star quality, far from everything and not relaxing.   Coming here was so much fun, relaxing, quiet (even with a lot of people in the hotel.) They worked hard to give my mother and I what we needed as she is in a walker... it was magical. The food is superb. Even when I lived there I wanted to visit this hotel and now I am glad I did. It's my go-to place!;5
We could see the New Yorker when we came up on the street from the subway. Perfect location. The lobby had all the flavor of NYC â buzz and excitement. Snacks, drinks, coffee, full breakfast and dinner were readily available without leaving the hotel in case of inclement weather. The 1930s bathtub and plentiful hot water afforded me delicious soaks after each arduous day. Love this hotel.;5
"We stayed here because our daughter was attending a camp nearby.  Perfect location.  I spoke to the concierge almost every day for suggestions (Linda and Helen).  I had a little communication problem regarding tickets for a show and Yordana (head of training) handled it with complete efficiency and followed up several times (even called me on her day off!).  Facilities were well maintained and the place is busy with lots of traffic.  Even the parking lots were being cleaned every day.  Hotel is located near all the ""Hollywood"" sites and close to Santa Monica.  We rented a car but shuttles and subway nearby (I didn't care for the public transport so we rented a vehicle).  Thanks to Pamela also at the front desk! Great follow up!";5
We travelled into NYC via train.  Staying at Wyndham New Yorker hotel was the best decision we could have made.  Excellent location, room was clean. Hotel staff pleasant and helpful. Security was fabulous.;5
I'm afraid that if I talk too much about this hotel that it won't be available next time cause it will be full!   Of course, everyone knows about the Empire anyways - but BOY did we love it there! Best location in the city, wonderful staff, we only stayed one night but were upgraded to a king. We had a room on the 9th floor, in the front of the hotel facing Broadway, north - a wonderful view and a beautiful room. The  restaurant downstairs (Ed's) was amazing - we sat in the bar, and ate from their Happy Hour menu. Walked across the street after the show we were in NYC for and ate at The Smith. Wandered into the Met yesterday where they JUST happened to have some great discounted tickets for La Boheme (last night) which were purchased by my parents who were staying a 2nd night.;5
This is a great, albeit expensive hotel. The room was clean and had great views. There are a lot of amenities nearby and it's close to the subway. The front desk staff who checked me in, nick was excellent. He was friendly and professional. Thank you!!;5
Must stay hotel in Los Angeles very safe even though some homeless but the they donât bother you. The hotel has some of the best staff. Very helpful and always there to help like Pil who works all the time :) day and night. He makes the hotel amazing. Breakfast is free and very well made. Pool is very nice but must wear mosquito cream. Overall super great hotel feels like home.;5
The location of this hotel was walking distance to Universal Studios as well as Universal city walk. Close to many varieties of restaurants and fast food places. Dodgers stadium and downtown LA were close by as well!;5
We were seeing a show at the Beacon Theater on Friday night, booked a last minute room at the Empire Hotel and were blown away with the service and the quality of the hotel.  We stay at a lot of Kimpton hotels and this has that kind of vibe, but better.  The staff were the most pleasant that I've encountered in a very long time.  The valet on Friday welcomed us with a joke and a smile.  We were checked in and out by Pasquale who seemed genuinely excited for us to be there and so helpful.  We stayed in a king room and it was just the right size.  The bed was firm and the shower was divine (two showerheads and strong water pressure). The hotel is located just across the street from Lincoln Center and a few blocks from the Beacon Theater, which was perfect for us.  A++;5
Nicest hotel at LAX.  Iâm a pilot and Iâve been to most.  Great staff, nice rooms, excellent workout facilities, clean and quiet.  The breakfast is outstanding.  My new âgo toâ hotel when at the LAX airport.;5
Just returned from a few days at The New Yorker. Great location, the room was adequate with comfortable clean beds and plenty of space for 3 ladies thanks to the upgrade from Mohammed who was very helpful and friendly as was all of the staff that we encountered. Housekeeping provided clean towels every day, the only downside is that there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms but that would not stop me returning to this hotel;5
We needed a place to stay to catch an early flight so we didn't want to spend a lot. I think my wife found the Windsor on hotel.com so we weren't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are small - but that is to be expected in a big city - but they were clean and nice and the staff had a car waiting for us at 4:15 a.m.  When staying in NYC, it's hard not to spend a ton on lodging. This place wasn't cheap but considering the horror stories of cheap hotels in the city, it was definitely nice! As for price, the walk-up price is quite a bit more than the online hotel sites quote so worth the extra effort.;5
Highly recommended raid. We can see why they are rated #1. The raid itself is very nice, great decor, and plenty of amenities (coffee tea whenever, free laundry, pool) but the service is what makes it exceptional! It's not centrally located but they make up for it by providing a local phone to call them any time of the day as well an escort to pick you up in well known locations. The ladies in the front desk were amazing, they really cater to everything you may need and make it a point to remember you (Asma in particular was phenomenal). It really is amazing one on one service you see at 5-stars hotels. No complaints from us.;5
From the minute I booked, I was excited about my trip.  My wife and I had to delay our anniversary dinner so we set it up for a night out so we could be NYC tourists for the day/night and picked the Empire for our stay.  We are glad we did!  The location of the hotel was perfect for us.  In walking distance to the attractions we wanted to see.  We were greeted immediately by pleasurable staff.  Upon check-in we were also issues 2 free beverage passes, which we used at the lobby bar.  An extremely comfortable environment and a nice place to unwind.  The room  - junior King suite - was more than spacious and comfortable as can be.  It also had everything you could possibly request from chargers, adapters, beverages and snacks. The hotel even had a great dinner recommendation -;5
Family of stayed here for Universal Studios. Best location and close to Hollywood Hotel is big but well run Rooms clean and well maintained Gym is good Breakfast buffet is outstanding Stuff go the extra mile....big help in arranging travel etc Have stayed in a few Hiltons in various countries and this is right up with the best Well Done;5
If you're traveling on a small budget, this is a great place to be. The hotel is in a great area, near food, a subway station, tons of shopping, and the Hudson River. While the downstairs area did get a little rowdy on weekend nights, my floor (the sixth) and room were always pretty quiet. Though the bathroom was shared with others on the floor, both the toilet and shower felt private and secure. Additionally, the staff was super nice and helpful. From the front desk staff to the housekeepers to anyone I saw in passing, everyone was always friendly and accommodating. I really don't know if there's a better deal in Manhattan... unless you're ballin' or something.;5
Really - the perfect place to stay in Marrakech! Stunning Riad, fabulous rooms, superb food, perfectly located for the wonderful Medina - but most of all huge thanks to the  incredibly welcoming hosts! (Elena, Ibrahim, Chaokie, Chinzia, Valentina - everyone!) Attention to detail was superb! Our safety, comfort, happiness was of the utmost importance to every single member of staff! Very good value for money! Will definitely be returning!;5
Loved this place! took my girlfriend for her 30th and they were amazing. The attention to detail, the friendly staff who were able to organise anything you wanted and the beautiful room and wider riad made this one of the best stays i've had in all my travels. Would highly highly recommend it.  The riad is deep in a warren of narrow lanes and makes you really feel like you're staying in Marrakech. Its also only a short (10 mins) walk to the main square and souks. Great for exploring while still being a quiet and relaxing base in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the city.;5
I have stayed here before, and enjoyed it so I decided to book again. My original room was small which would normally be fine, but I'm staying for a week. Randy at the front desk was very polite, helpful, and even upgraded my room for free.;5
"Gorgeous views, beautiful decor and a safe location in a central area convenient to all of Manhattan. Just a block from Penn Station, this is the perfect hotel for those arriving by train.  Walking distance from Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, the Empire State Building, Macy's, Greenwich Village, and Hudson Yards; I had no need to spend extra money on a Taxi or Uber my entire trip. A doorman is on hand to help with luggage and assist with valet parking or hailing a cab for those who have transportation needs within the city.  Hotel security checked room keys for everyone going to the elevator lobby, and front desk staff was attentive and professional. The retro art-deco theme is interesting and fun. The attached restaurants weren't great, with mediocre and overpriced food";5
"Ideally located beside Penn Station and with the fantastic Tick Tock Diner attached, this is a perfect hotel for exploring Manhattan. McDonald's, Starbucks and the lovely Italian restaurant ""Famiglia"" are directly opposite the hotel entrance.";5
Our family's first visit to Marrakech was undoubtedly enhanced by our stay at this Riad.  We were blown away by the beauty and unique experience of the Riad itself.  The staff went above and beyond from the arrival meeting with the manager to be sure we had everything we needed as far as plans and feeling safe to the departure meeting to get feedback on our stay, Our children took a day off sightseeing to relax at the pool and patio areas while we all enjoyed the rooftop dining and exquisite and authentic breakfast and dinners. We would 100% recommend this Riad and will stay there again if we get the chance to return to Marrakech,;5
My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend. This Riad is truly an oasis. It is beautifully decorated, luxurious and incredibly clean.    All of the people who work here, from the incredibly helpful front office staff to the young men who help carry the bags to the waiters and servers, are amazing, and go out of their way to make sure that you never want or need for anything, 24 hours a day.   You will treasure memories of your stay at this beautiful Riad.;5
I called them at midnight to have something sent to my wife's room for her birthday and even though the concierge was closed a nice gentleman named Ricky hooked me up big time! He jumped all over the opportunity to help me and I am so appreciative! Thank you Ricky at Empire!;5
My husband I went to New York for a one night stay to see the musical  Beautiful.  I found the best rates on booking.com for the New Yorker.   What a great stay.  All staff were friendly and helpful.  There is a 24/7 diner on the premises.  All the rooms were clean and comfortable.;5
Very welcoming & comfortable hotel. Fairly central to Times Square but far enough of the beaten track.   The hotel has a basic restaurant which serves it purpose for breakfast with breathtaking views.   The rooms are comfortable. Varying in size & shape but ideal to settle down after a busy day!   Staff are very helpful & welcoming, they are also very informative with things to do/where to go. Concierge also very resourceful with excellent discounted tickets.  Iâd recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to travel to New York who wants a bit of authentic Art Deco alongside their stay.   Iâll defo be back there!;5
Finally finished, nicely done great place to stay for meeting or early flight out. Free bus to and from airport every 15 minutes. Food good but could be upgraded a bit, needs more seating in bar area.;5
The hotel is centrally located on BROADWAY. On 54th st. Easy walking access to many attractions. The hotel is clean well maintained and has helpful staff. Room and bed are excellent,as are the usual facilities. There is a small exercise room and sauna.,neither of which did I use. There is a bar,open in the evenings. Breakfast is available in a smallish dining area. There are many eating places to cater for all needs in easy walking distance. Wifi is available free in the lobby,and in the rooms for a charge.  Free WiFi is accessible in the rooms from a citywide service too.;5
Excellent value great location close to the Juilliard school for the arts and the MET. Steps away from Central park and walking distance to many attractions. The staff at the hotel, everyone we met, was friendly and very helpful. There is a great rooftop lounge.;5
Lovely hostel for the price! Very clean! Great facilities! Donât understand the previous comments about the staff as they were very polite and happy towards me. Quiet street and yes some noise, but itâs a hostel not a hotel... overall lovely weekend stay during carnival... will be back!;5
Catching a very early morning connecting flight from LAX to Asia, we decided to stay overnight at Hyatt Regency LAX to avoid potential weather delay departure from our home airport and missing our flight.  We made a wonderful decision.  The hotel was next to the airport making arriving and leaving the hotel very easy with a hotel shuttle.  We didn't have to worry about the slow LA freeway traffic to make the connecting flight.  Kiania, the Front Desk Representative, welcomed us warmly when she checked us in as if we were returning guest even though it was our first time.   After checking in, I enjoyed relaxing in the late afternoon sunshine & swimming in the large size pool with 8-1/2 feet deep-end.  Lots of lounge chairs were available as well as the thick towels. However, the;5
I want to THANK The Hilton for Kevin and Jerome. Two AMAZING individuals who makes people/guests feel like they are the ONLY in the entire hotel. They not process the check-in process efficiently and CARINGLY, they also make sure throughout the guest's stay is SPECIAL. They were VERY PROFESSIONAL but personable and hospitable.  I have been an Hilton Honors Member for a while and currently a Silver Elite Status (still working my way up) and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this Hotel because of the prestige of the brand, the location, amenities and also, more importantly because of the way Kevin and Jerome made my family feel.;5
A great place to stay for location and value. Service in the Chowder House restaurant leaves a lot to be desired, but frankly, go somewhere else to eat.  The hotel itself was great and the bar was very nice.;5
The service was impeccable and the staff at Riad Kheirredine do everything to make you feel at home and get the most out of your visit. This includes complimentary non-alcoholic drinks, excellent recommendations of things to do and providing a mobile phone in case you get lost.  The Riad itself is beautiful and incredibly peaceful. Make sure to have dinner one night at the Riad â this is served on the roof terrace.   We would recommend Riad Kheirredine to anyone visiting Marrakech. Excellent service, value for money and location (Ben Slimane is a 10-15 min walk from Jamaa el Fna).;5
Stayed here early June and totally satisfied with everything, the staff were very helpful and couldnât do enough for us, would definitely stay here again and hope to with the children.  Some time soon. Thank you very much.;5
From check in to check out this small hotel offers a great service. Very friendly staff, clean rooms and incredible clean shared bathrooms. The rooms are really small ( the website shows it clearly ) are equiped with AC, heater, Flat Screen TV, DVD, Alarm Clock, confortable bed. The windows could be larger. The hotel smells good and is perfectly kept. Sleepers and a robe are part of the amenities. The showers ( individually separed ) offer shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. The toilets are always white as just cleaned.  I stayed for 6 nights paying around USd 120 ( tax included ).  The location is great. Close to Chelsea Market and dozens of bars and restaurants of the Meatpacking District ( very fancy ).  There is a parking lot right across the street and subway can be;5
The staff was very friendly and the hotel is ADORABLE. Greatly appreciate Nancy at the front desk, Fanny, Elvira, Ana and Oralia in the kitchen... simply everyone. The staff went out of their way to help us with anything we needed. Will definitely come back!;5
Stayed for 5 nights. Beautiful reception area and concierge staff go above and beyond to help. Rooms are immaculate with extremely comfortable beds. Tick Tok Diner was lovely. The staff in there are all so friendly. We witnessed some extremely rude people talking horrible to one member of staff, we was sitting at the counter and it really was more about the customer than the staff member, he took it well but there really is no need for such rudeness .. stay at home and be miserable. We had a lovely stay and will be returning next year. The lady who in charge of the left luggage is awesome, perfect customer service.;5
Room was a little dated but it was spotlessly clean , the bed was very comfortable and the air con was amazing , we visited in a heat wave so air con was very much appreciated. Staff were friendly and helpful and the hotelâs a 5 minute stroll to Central Park . We would definitely recommend and stay there again;5
Great staff, prime location . Everyone at the hotel was super friendly and helpful. The property is located in an area that makes getting around fast and simple. It is five minutes walking distance to Times Sqaure, ten minutes to Chinatown (on the Subway) and actually has a Subway entrance on the corner (34St and 8th Ave).;5
we have just returned from a four night stay at the Empire, we were upgraded to a junior suite and after being out on a tour, returned to champagne on ice as we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, so a big thank you. Our room was perfect with views out to the street. Yes the coffee/tea was $3, but when on holiday that is not expensive. The concierge Chris was fantastic and helped us with everything from booking a city tour to helping us plan a journey on the underground, to booking our transfer back to the airport, he is a gem. The guys on the door were also lovely and always greeted us as we left/entered the hotel. Hope to return in the future and would book the Empire again. Thanks for making our stay so special;5
We love to stop over in this vintage hotel situated in the heart of Manhattan. Even though the breakfast is not included in the room price, there is an adjusting bar open 24h/7 days a week and a chic restaurant situated in the basement: a former bank safe :-) One can put all the chargers on the hotel key - no inconvenience  of separate payments. Pay attention to a âcubistâ mural in the stairway, downstairs, in association with a mirror breaking down your image in a similar way.;5
In the heart of the Marrakesh Medina, Riad Kheirredine is a must-stay!  The rooms, terrace, pools and various sitting areas are welcoming, clean and comfortable.  However, the friendly and accommodating staff is what puts this experience OVER THE TOP!   The service far exceeds the standard!  Sara and the front office staff- Arjane, Elena and Siham will do everything to assist you to make your stay more comfortable:  Booking dinner reservations, arranging for taxi or tuk tuk pick-ups or just a friendly hello and chat after a fun day out in the town!  The Terrace is a great place for breakfast and dinner and Yassine, Ibrahim and Karim will attend to your every need, providing some laughs and conversation as well.  Every meal we had was delicious.  Lenny gives a great massage and;5
After staying at The Jane twice I have now decided that it is my favorite hotel anywhere.  Not just in New York City, but in the whole world.  The reason is that The Jane me to stay in New York City, my favorite city, in a modicum of luxury without spending thousands of dollars for a week in the city.  Sure, if someone else were paying for my stay or I had all the money in the world I would probably stay at one of the other great hotels in the area, like the Standard or the Gansevoort, or possibly a classic mid-town hotel.  But for visiting New York on my own dime I am a Jane devotee.    I need three things when I visit NYC: 1) a good location 2) a reliable and preferably free Internet connection 4) cleanliness.  The Jane provides all four.  It's about a three minute walk from;5
I stayed during a business trip for a conference. The service is excellent, the rooms nicely decorated and clean, and both breakfast and dinner of high quality and tasty.  Definitely recommend it both for leisure and business travelers.;5
Wonderful Staff and a very clean room!  They were extremely helpful throughout our stay.  Also a great location within walking distance to theatres, Central Park, etc.  Reasonable rates as well.  Will stay again!;5
My best friend and I stayed here at the end of October/beginning of November and had a really nice time. The rooms felt spacious and the beds were super comfortable and it was walking distance to a lot of great places.  When we checked out to leave, we went out to my car and my battery was dead. We went inside and asked if anyone could help us, and the front desk manager Gisel stopped what she was doing to go out to her car and grab her jumper cables and jump our car! We were so appreciative of her and the hospitality we received and it is the number one reason we will return. Thank you Gisel!  Christine;5
This is a fantastic hotel. Itâs so good that I reactivated my long-dormant TripAdvisor account to write a review. The staff was amazing: super nice, friendly, and helpful. I cannot say enough good things about every person we encountered. The room was great â huge (and this is New York!), comfortable, and most important, clean. Keep in mind this is a 100-year-old building so âcleanâ does not always mean ânew,â but we felt very comfortable. They did a great job, especially given the pandemic. Itâs worth checking out the small museum about the history of the hotel in the basement, or even just the Wikipedia page. Thank you to the fantastic people at The New Yorker. Weâll be back for sure!;5
This is hands down the best hotel I have experienced to date. The customer service and the facilities were simply impeccable. The riad was truly our home away from home, our peaceful oasis from the business of the city.   Not only were the rooms and the rooftop (our favorite place at the riad) just enchanting and always spotless, but the staff was truly a model of excellent service (better than most top-notch or luxury hotels, who could learn a thing or two from these guys). From Valentina and Yajaira at the front desk, to Ibraim, Ishmael, and Abdul (who were my Champions League semi-finals watching buddies), to the housekeeping staff of Helena, Cathy, and all the rest of the staff. The minute we walked through the door after every excursion, we always had their full attention;5
The location is great.  We traveled by NJ-Transit to Penn Station.   The hotel is less than a block away.   Easy access to subway.   Easy walking distance to Times Square.   We had a suite for a family of 4, including 2 kids over 15 - it was a nice room with a great view of the Empire State building.  The staff was friendly, and everything was in good working order.    We ate several times at the connected Tick Tock diner - where the service and food were great.   I'd definitely stay here again.;5
We have just returned from a fantastic stay on NYC. The Ameritania is ideally situated for sightseeing. The staff are friendly and helpful. They upgraded our room as our stay was my sons 18th birthday present and there was a little birthday cake in our room on arrival. Rooms are very comfortable and stylish and are cleaned every day. Would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
We chose Riad Kheirredine because we wanted somewhere that was Moroccan and not a western style hotel and we were not disappointed. The Riad is in the Medina, a labrynth of alleys and streets - too narrow for cars. The rooms at the Riad are Moroccan in style, perhaps a little dark but you probably need that in the summer. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was adequate. Water is complimentary as is any laundry that needs doing. The staff are very helpful with nothing too much trouble. Food was good and wine was at a reasonable price. I may perhaps have liked a change in the menu after a few nights but that is a small point. The highlight feature of the Riad is the rooftop terrace which catches the sun, even in January, and is a splendid place to relax. Breakfast;5
Excellent and above and beyond service during a stressful flight delay situation. .I really do not think they could have done more for us.  As well, the restaurant server, Trina was so nice and funny.  The shuttle to the airport driver was very kind as well with us.  Overall nothing but the best is my description of this property.;5
I won't lie, apart from the fab decor the only reason I wanted to stay here was because of Gossip Girl, it being Chuck's hotel in the program and we weren't disappointed.  We stayed in August at the very end of a month long trip round USA and Canada.  We were caught up in the travel chaos of Hurricane Irene and only stayed at the hotel one night instead of three but it was soooo worth it. The staff were fantastic and kept our room for us every day that we rang with an update without any hassles at all and when we eventually arrived from Montreal, everyone was so friendly and helpful and the same deluxe room we had reserved was still being held for us.  The hotel was immaculate and the decor is beautiful yet funky! We loved our room, it was small and so was the bathroom but we;5
We stayed here as part of our 40th anniversary holiday having previously been to Toronto and Niagara Falls. I thought the Empire might suffer by comparison with the other 2 hotels (Westin and Sheraton) being a city centre hotel but it was a delightful surprise in nearly all respects.  We were upgraded to a King sized room and even had a complimentary bottle of bubbly awaiting us in the room. What a wonderful touch!  Everyone was very friendly and helpful but particularly Yuri on Concierge. He is a star.  I am obviously a little influenced by the special treatment we received but this aside, I would still thoroughly recommend this hotel.;5
We had a fantastic weekend break in this ideally located hotel. The staff was fantastic and always enthusiastic and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel because of its ideal location, friendly helpful staff and great value.;5
"The New Yorker is a spectacular hotel in NYC! As a Wyndham Platinum member I was upgraded to an amazing suite at a very fair rate! Rachell and Onelia took wonderful care of us and we even got to check in early! The room was very large considering we are in Manhattan. The suite had a separate living area with a mini bar; it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Breathtaking view of the Hudson from our room! Thanks again! We will be staying again soon!";5
'Andy' was so nice to us at the desk and felt very comfortable. He helped us a lot with the Stay and answered all our questions calmly. Anything you request, he will do the magic in few minutes. Great Job and Thank you for your assistance, Andy!;5
The Hilton hotel is an amazing place to stay. The service there from guest services, valet, concierge, and even head management is superb.  Absolutely amazing.  I have stayed there many times and will continue.  Thank you, Hilton and staff for an amazing trip.;5
We arrived at the hotel expecting the worst from some of the reviews on here!!! shocked at how wonderful it was, perfect location, brilliant staff and amazing rooms, i would like to add the comedy nights that are held there is a must do!! some of the comics were bizzare, but laughed so hard at some a little bit of wee came out!! i would highly recommend this hotel, its not the MGM grand but is well worth the money.;5
My friend and I stayed for 9 days this month. I had frequently stayed at a top hotel in NY that has just closed and was unsure what to expect here. I was very pleasantly surprised. The staff were welcoming, helpful and friendly. The room was large for New York, clean with all the facilities I would expect at a top hotel. I had one minor problem with a non-working TV that was fixed in minutes and two requests that were fulfilled within the hour. Excellent indeed. The bars are well staffed and comfortable. And the rooftop bar is an experience in itself with a magnificent view. The location is what makes it for me: across the road from the Met/Lincoln Center and a block away from Central Park, with lots of good restaurants nearby.  I thoroughly recommend the hotel and will return;5
Decided to finally go and visit NYC, being from a small town in Ohio did not know where  or what to do in NYC. It was just an over the weekend thing so there was no way we could cover all the sights we thought we should check out.  The doorman named Tommy, I wouldn't even dare pronounce or spell his last name since he was Greek helped us tremendously by giving us pointers where and how to get to places, when we should use a yellow cab or just use the subways. Thanks to him we were able to do twice as much  as we though we could do in such short amount of time.  Definitely visiting this place again;5
The empire hotel is always clean, very accommodating and extremely well taken care of. it's close to everything - central park, Columbus circle, times square... I stay here every time I come to NYC & have never once felt unsafe or at risk.;5
were good rooms clean and good , pool vere small  no  heat of water I miss to have International brekvest in the morning yougurt ,bread , fruits .... but I will come back ,Tv good , the WC are very small  but it ok , allways taxi and the picalo in the lobbie  are wery good;5
One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.  Rooms and hotel are remarkably clean and sparkling.  Very close to Universal Studios.  A wonderful experience and great value.;5
Loved staying here - cosy rooms, nice, grand feeling to the place. Right in the heart of where everything is happening and most main attractions are only a few short steps away. Really gave me the feeling of being in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. Rooms were very clean and well cared for.;5
I was delighted to staying at the beautiful & clean Hyatt right adjacent to LAX International Airport. The staff from greeting to Bellman for superb along with the food and the cleanliness in the room were excellent would definitely recommend staying there;5
Great place to stay. Very nice and people were friendly and helpful. Great location in Midtown Manhattan. Already planning a trip back next year. Can't wait!;5
We stayed at this Hilton by Universal Studios because it's close to the park and they have a shuttle that takes you to the CityWalk. The corner room was nice and good size for 3 adults. We were on the 17th floor so we had a great view of the city and the park. Staff is nice but don't believe them when they say they booked a taxi for you.;5
"If I were to design the perfect hotel my wish list would include; beautiful, stylish interiors, kind, helpful staff, lovely outside space and free hot and soft drinks available at any time. Luckily for me, the owners of the Riad Kheirredine fulfilled my wishes and added a few more wonderful surprises including providing every guest with a model phone to use in case you get lost in the Medina, amazing staff who walk you down to the souk, bowls of fresh fruit all around the hotel and delicious snacks brought with the drinks. From the moment you leave the dusty maze of alleyways in the Medina and pass through the wooden door in the wall, you know that you have entered a magical place. The smell of the scented oils, the bowls of white roses, the genuinely warm and friendly welcome;";5
Amazing customer service. The hotel was very clean and accommodating. Jeffâs assistance was very very helpful. He was respectful and helped any chance he could. Would recommend this hotel to everyone.;5
We just got married in NYC last weekend.  For our friends and family it was a destination wedding.  The hotel was a perfect fit.  The location is excellent for the Upper West Side.  The staff was incredibly kind and accommodating to all our guests.  The rooms were very nice.  Had some issues with the shower but the hotel is working to correct it.  We have stayed in NYC many times usually at another hotel which my husband's company prefers, but when it comes to our preference on non-related business trips, we will stay here again.  I would highly recommend it.;5
"I travel to NYC every month and stay at the New Yorker each time; this has been over the past 8-9 years.  I love the hotel, its staff (particularly the very helpful Mohamed) and its great location.  Lots of history and beautiful art deco touch.  Love this hotel!";5
We stayed 8 nights here in April . Nice and close to Times Square and a few other sights ! Great hotel , great staff â¦ great stay. We will use this hotel again. Built in 1929, and one of the iconic buildings in New York. Takes you back in time as you enter the foyer â¦ lovely atmosphere , highly recommended deserves  â­ï¸ â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸;5
We booked the Hilton for 3 days for the purpose of visiting Universal Studios. The staff are just lovely and very polite and helpful. We found that all staff did everything they could to help us. We requested a low floor due to lift maintenance via email prior to arriving and were given a room on the lobby floor. Our room was comfortable and clean, the Hilton is less than a 10 minute walk from Universal Studios and we found this ideal for walking there with children. We had a lovely stay and would definitely stay again.;5
Awesome hotel right across from LAX. We were immediately greeted by a welcoming and diverse staff. Rooms were super modern, tech friendly and clean. Guest services were polite & responsive! Stay here!;5
"The room was big and tidy; it was possible to open part of the window, so the air was not as stuffy as it sometimes gets inside a big hotel. The location was amazing, close to the subway, Times Square, and Central Park, yet not so close as to be chaotic outside. We had a great time here!    A special shout out to Jeff who helped with our luggage, and Georgina (sp?) who took care of housekeeping!";5
i'm from Canada,and this is very good and welcoming hotel. everything is so beatufull,my room was just an amazing, lots of speace very clean.  looking forward to stay here on my next trip to New York. thanks;5
If you go to Marrakech and you should go to Marrakech for lots of reasons but one of the reasons should be to stay at this Riad.  I have NEVER stayed at a place anything like this.  The building, room, rooftop terrace and service were beyond anything almost anyone reading this has ever experienced.  I won't go into every detail, but from the time they met us to guide us to the hotel until they took us to the transport back to the airport they took care of everything.  They even filled out our departure form for leaving Morocco.  That's the level of care and detail they take care of.  The room was immaculate and spotless.  The breakfast served in the morning was great and wine or beers in the evening on the terrace were also beyond expectation.   They even gave you a local mobile;5
A fantastic hotel with friendly and helpful staff, especially Muhammad who made this trip extra special when he found out it was a 50th birthday trip.  Excellent mid-town location very convenient to Penn and Pennsylvania Stations, be warned they are different, lesson learned :-)  Close to Times Square, Maddison Square Garden and an easy walk to Javits Center.  Would be more than happy to return.;5
"The room is very clean, as a luxury bed, and clean..  AC is its good cool air.. Parking lot was clean and secure.. The hotel water fountain was beautiful made..   The best thing i like the is the weather and the customer service.. We came for the choice convention. ;-)";5
We really loved this hotel.  The room was large, with an awesome view of the San Fernando Valley.  It was almost panoramic because the windows are angled and the whole back wall is windows.  We asked for extra pillows and blankets and they came right up immediately.  We ate dinner in the large lounge area and everyone liked it so much they wanted to eat there the next night!  When we got back to the room they had given us a tray with fruit and cookies etc., for no reason!  The only improvement they could make would be to add more chairs around the pool.  We would definately stay there again.;5
Stayed in this riad with a couple of friends, for 4 nights, having been recommended by other friends who have stayed there several times. I can see why it was so highly recommended and gets such great reviews...everything was fantastic! All the staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. They booked a trip to the Atlas Mountains for us, made restaurant reservations and came to rescue us when we were a bit lost on several occasionsð The mobile phone guests are given so you can ring for help is a brilliant idea. It really is very easy to get lost inside the medina, it's like a maze but after a few days it all becomes a bit more familiar. If you've read about things like people offering to show you to certain areas of the souk... back to your riad...telling you the way;5
I loved my stay at Morningside Inn hotel in New York! This was my first visit to the city, and I really didn't want a bad hotel to ruin everything for me. Well, I'm glad that I had made a wise choice! Morningside Inn is perfectly located - the area is clean, safe, has a lot of shops, banks, restaurants, etc. It's minutes away from the subway and you can easily get anywhere from there. The hotel itself was very quiet - no noisy parties, no drinking on the porch. The management was very helpful. The room was cleaned every day, and so were the bathroom facilities. There is an Internet room in the basement, that has a computer and free Wi-Fi access. In short, this hotel is highly recommended for everyone who travels on a budget but wishes to get the most out of his/her New York;5
One month after I returned from vacation, I am still thinking about my stay in Riad Kheirredine.  My family and I (two adults plus two 18 year olds) stayed for 4 nights and we loved every minute of it.  Marrakech is so spectacular and my only regret was that we were not there longer.  The people are so warm and friendly and it was really, a trip of a life time.  The hotel is quite lovely and beautifully appointed.  We fell in love with the staff (Elena, Tori, Ibrahim) who did everything in their power to make us feel not only at home but part of a family.  If I were you, I would book this location immediately. It is going to be the highlight of the trip.  We loved all the nooks and crannies--especially the terraces and we were able to relax as a family.  The hotel confirmed all;5
Lovely location right behind the London Eye. Handy for tube and river travel. Very clean with nice recently refurbished rooms. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was nice and lots of choice. Would definitely stay here again;5
We stayed here for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. Our room was a little small but kept immaculately clean by housekeeping twice daily. Unlimited water, fresh mint tea and fruit. Customer service from Riad staff is exceptional - friendly, helpful and sincere. Escorted walks by Riad staff to meeting points are valuable to avoid getting lost in the MÃ©dina. Highlight of Riad is the roof terrace.;5
What a beautiful hotel a stones throw from Universal Studios. The room is large wth huge windows that make it light and bright. Very nice bathroom making it a very comfortable room.  We checked in late at night it was a breeze. Overall, great hotel.;5
This is our 2nd time at this hotel for an overnight stay.  We stay here overnight because we usually book an early morning flight and want to be near the airport.  This hotel has a 24 hour complimentary airport shuttle which departs every 10-15 minutes and also a 24 hour mini mart type food counter in the lobby.  LOVE that.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  The only thing I would recommend is putting some house slippers in the room.  That would make the stay perfect.;5
Muhammad was a super great front desk employee & the manager was super sweet and nice ! Sheâs the best , and the room was amazing lovely view ! I will definitely be back. Although you have to pay 20$ extra for a fridge the treatment was priceless ,;5
What an outstanding Riad. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by the wonderful Elena, it became apparent that our every need could be catered for during our 8 night stay. All the staff were amazingly friendly, helpful and happy to chat about all things Moroccan, both cultural and of a general nature.  Breakfast on the terrace was delicious, varied and plentiful and designed to be lingered over...no need to rush anywhere ! Dinner, also on the terrace, provided romantic views of the Medina, distant mountain range, the new town and brightly lit mosques. The Riad is so well located, allowing ready walking access into the bustling and chaotic narrow alleys of the Medina, yet only a short walk to another access point in the old Medina wall leading to the Majorelle Gardens (20;5
If youâre looking to experience the Medina and have a calm oasis to recover after a long day of adventure, this is the place for you. From the beautiful rooms, to the spacious terrace area, the infrastructure of this riad is simply outstanding. But what makes this place so special is the personalized customer service and the food. Within minutes of entering, Sarah, Elena and the reception team took care of us and explained everything we had to know. Straight away, we felt at home. Shortly after, we went to the terrace to enjoy a recovery drink and a traditional Morrocan meal. Yassine, Yliass and the whole service team served us delicious meals and offered a level of customer service, that we never experienced before. During our stay, we nearly went through the whole menu and;5
This was my first time visiting Marrakech and I chose the riad after reading the reviews on here. I have to say it exceeded my expectations. We arrived at 1030am and were collected from our taxi, it was then a 5 min walk to the riad through the narrow streets.  We stayed in the Ambra room.   They had prepared a breakfast for us when we arrived as they thought we might be hungry and we were given flannels to freshen up.  I thought this was a nice touch and very thoughtful. After breakfast, Valentina, front of house, talked us through how to survive in Marrakech, told us they were on call 24 hrs for us and that all drinks except coke and alcohol were included in the price. I didnt expect this at all and it was a lovely surprise.  For the duration of our stay we were given a mobile;5
The Hilton is a perfect location if you are visiting Universal Studios/Harry Potter World. They have a shuttle that goes to the park every 10-15 minutes, but it was less than a 10 minute walk. The hotel and rooms were clean, and the room and bathroom were very spacious. Plus, it was extremely quiet in our room. All of the staff we encountered from the valet to the elevator attendants were friendly and helpful.   Note that if you are in a larger vehicle (over 6 feet), you cannot park in their self parking garage and must pay extra to valet. My only negative is the breakfast buffet was extremely overpriced. Next time I would order a regular breakfast or go somewhere else. I would definitely stay here again.;5
My husband and I traveled into the city late Saturday night. Upon arrival there was a controlled line for the rooftop bar, and the doorman quickly helped us maneuver those people and into the building. The front desk staff was bright and cheery even though it was 11:45pm. Nick was helpful in making sure we were set and ready to go. When we first arrived to the king suite and saw the view of Lincoln center I was amazed. The room was a good size, we had a seating area, living room, and spacious bedroom.   I like that this hotel was close enough to touristy things, but also had real NYC charm. I loved that everything we wanted to do was in walking distance. We were close to central park, 5th avenue, broadway, Rockefeller center, Bryant park, MSG, Columbus circle.  However, when we;5
An amazing stay at this lovely hotel for my daughters wedding in Central Park.  The staff were excellent, particularly Emily Nicholls.  Nothing was too much trouble and all major attractions are fairly close by.  I will definitely return.;5
We had a great state at the Wyndham New Yorker. The location is excellent so close to Penn Street station which had it possible to get the airtrain from Jfk to the city instead of having to get a cab and sit in traffic. The rooms are small but clean and a little dated but for a central location this wasn't an issue as very little time spent in the room. We went for my 40th birthday and was given a room with a view of the empire state building and Maddison Square garden. Tick tock diner is attached we ate in there a few times. Lovely pizza place across the road and Cvs is opposite for drinks and snacks for the room. We would definitely stay here agai;5
We stayed at the Riad for 6 days in May - in many years of traveling this was the best hospitality I have ever experienced!!! The staff at Riad Kheirredine are incredible.  They really know how to make you feel at home and they genuinely care that you enjoy your stay in Morocco.  If I were to do one thing different I would have trusted them more and earlier on in planning our trip! They provide a cell phone to their guests and will come get you if you get lost! Riad Kheirredine was such a welcoming oasis to come back to each day- the food was delicious - they will deliver to any where in the hotel that you want to eat! The rooftop terrace was our favorite part of the hotel - it is tranquill and has stunning views of Marrakech.  I highly recommend enjoying your first meal in;5
My mom recently stayed here for a layover. It was her birthday, and she came to visit me in LA. It was a nice day outside, so she decided to walk to the hotel from the airport instead of taking the shuttle. Unfortunately, on the walk over she tripped over a lip in the sidewalk and fell flat on her face. Once inside, my mom's coworker grabbed her some ice. The hotel staff was incredibly comforting and did everything they could to help my mom feel better.  We had two incredibly kind men helping us, Cairo and Derrik. Both of my parents have worked for decades in customer service. My mom was so impressed with how kind and courteous they both were. It was obviously a pretty dramatic situation for my mom (especially on her birthday!), but Derrik and Cairo were extraordinary. Derrik;5
I have never written a review on Trip advisor, but read many! However, Riad Kherirredine deserves a special mention. I have been asked about Marrakech many times since I got back and every time I have recommended staying at this Riad to ALL friends/family/colleagues/strangers etc Organising anything with the Riad team is very straight forward. You tell Valentina or whoever might be manning the desk what you would like and they will deliver...Airport transfers, taxis, guides (Sharif was excellent, and recommended for a couple of hours on your first day if you don't know the City), Restaurants, Bars, Hot Air Ballooning etc etc I travelled with my Wife for our Anniversary and having mentioned this to them in a previous e-mail, way before our Arrival, we were treated to a wonderful;5
Art Deco, quaint, quirky hotel convenient to Lincoln Center, pharmacy, great restaurants, and Central Park. Wonderful experience with courteous staff. Love the rooftop bar/view of the city. Well kept and maintained facility, with quiet rooms and comfortable beds.;5
Visited the Pool Deck & Bar last week.  Courteous, prompt and friendly service (especially, a young man named Tyler), not to mention the tasty food, great drinks and the awesome views of Lincoln Center and beyond.  We're definitely coming back, and after that experience, we may just book a few nights and stay over as well!;5
Great location for Universal and a very nice outdoor pool/hot tub. Fitness center is nice and also great places to eat around (Close walk to Citywalk - five minutes), very  nice breakfast buffet and dinner buffet at hotel and then also a few great restaurants down the hill;5
It was an amazing time there. All of the people have been more than friendly.  We have been picked up from the airport and for our comfort we got a mobil phone from the Riad to text or call wherever we are to be picked up or if we have any problems or questions.  Everything that you wish for, will be done. Breakfast in your own balcony or tea in the midnight is no problem. The interior is charming, stylish and also traditional. The spa treatments are very good.  Must do is the hamam combined with the massage. We highly recommend this Riad.;5
Me my son and his mate stayed here dec 7-14 nice clean hotel really friendly we never eat here but the door men made us feel welcome the room was well equipped bathroom clean the heating was good at one point we had to turn it off they took so much out of my account a day to pay for the amenities;5
My wife and l stayed here for 4 days. Great hotel. We were upgraded to a doudle room which was superb. Staff and service great. LA is expensive and the hotel knows how to charge for meals etc, very expensive but good food. You pay for parking also around Â£40.00 per night plus tax so can work out expensive over a number of days. Location superb in my option, you are next to universal, but for most places you need to drive. Getting around we found easy although traffic heavy. Overall great place to stay;5
Right outside the gates of Universal City, the location couldn't be better. It's a great hotel, obviously a big chain hotel, so you know what you're getting. Friendly staff, decent sized rooms, clean and well furnished. If you're visiting Universal City, I would recommend it.;5
Really nice hotel. Located right by central park and a short walk to times square. Pleaseant staff, lOvely roof top bar. Highly reccomend;5
Very friendly staff. Daniel did an excellent job with customer service. It was great having a free tesla charger available inside the gate and parking lots to charge overnight. Made me feel very safe leaving my vehicle in the parking lot.;5
Stayed here for 2 nights prior to a cruise. The hotel and staff were really lovely. The hotel has a breakfast option which we had , the food was quite good but the breakfast room doesn't have enough tables so we sat in the bar area with breakfast on a small bar table which wasn't very good. The bar was great for the evenings with a lovely gas effect fire and comfortable sofas. Rooms were spacious and comfortable.;5
Considering age of the property, was pleasantly surprised by overall quality and appearance. The exercise room was definitely an upside surprise. Liked the little museum in the corridors adjacent to the exercise room. Hallways on the guest floors are a little run down, but everything else is in pretty good shape.;5
Great room, appreciated early check in, Jeffrey the door man was beyond helpful in recommending restaurants and arranging a car back to JFK. Great location, lovely bar and a fantastic weekend. We will all be returning;5
I will be back , the room was very clean in a great area , access to all of the major locations, the paint or wall paper was a loud but otherwise the room design was wonderful, the bathroom was set up excellently;5
We had an amazing experience, the hotel staff was wonderful, Jeffrey took the time to map out a plan for us to conquer the city and see all of the sites. He was extremely knowledgeable and really made our trip the best it could be! The rooms were great, the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel was modern, clean and comfortable. We will be back!;5
The hotel was beautiful, rooms comfortable and clean, staff exceptionally helpful.  I was worried we would be treated differently since we had gotten a great price, but I was certainly wrong! We were placed in a beautiful corner room overlooking lincoln center. The doorman was extremely kind and helpful, as well as the front desk gentleman. Room was cleaned daily and bed was so comfy!;5
My stay was just what the doctor ordered. The Riad is beautiful and very tranquil. The room we stayed in was lovely (rose). The breakfast was delicious. And most importantly the staff were truly lovely. Our waiter always had the warmest smile and made us feel that nothing was too much trouble. Marco was so helpful at guiding us round Marrakech. And Marina was so willing to help us ensure our stay was eveything we could wish for. If you want to stay somewhere where you feel a warm welcome and with beautiful rooms and excellent service without having to pay ridiculous prices, then look no further!;5
On our arrival to Riad Kheirrediene we were met by the staff with friendly smiles and a tour of the hotel. Around every nook and cranny was a new well appointed sitting area with lush plants and comfortable seating. The staff could not do enough for us, always available and discretely attentive to give us whatever we wanted. The breakfasts and coffees served where ever we chose to be in the morning, room, pool or on of the outside sitting areas. Dinner was delicious whether we had moroccan cuisine or western options. The room was well appointed with windows, large bathroom and extremely comfortable bed. The location of the Raid is a 20 minute walk to the main square, great location. I could not recommend this Riad more. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Marrakech. We would;5
My wife and I booked this hotel last minute while arriving at the airport A LOT earlier than expected due to flight times changing, and this was THE BEST thing we done arriving in LA. Arriving at the hotel at 7.30am, we were greeted by Elias & Cinthya who happily helped us out by giving us a Free Breakfast and held our bags until we could check in at earliest convenience. Their customer service was UNREAL!! Second to none!! It didn't stop there though, when we went to have out free breakfast we were greeted by Hugo who gave us a personal tour of everything on offer for breakfast and then proceeded to make a special omlette to my liking. IT WAS AMAZING!! He made me feel so welcome, in fact all the staff here made my wife and I feel great about our stay here. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND;5
Big hotel with lots of amenities, efficient checkin and checkout, clean and quiet rooms, old-world charm. It has a superbly central location, close to all tourist attractions and public transport. There is a nice atmosphere. I can definitely recommend it.;5
Great location, very friendly staff! Beds were very good & Excellent Pillows!! We can' t wait to come back and stay again.  We stayed as a family and found it very affordable as well as close to man attractions.;5
We stayed for 4 nights and could not have asked for a better hotel. The most important thing for us was that the whole experience was exactly (if not better) than both the Riad website and Tripadvisor had promoted. The location,  quality of the accommodation, customer service and food & drinks were all outstanding......at a very reasonable price. This was more like staying with a great friend for a few days than just a hotel.;5
This place is ideal for central Manhattan. A few minutes walk from Times Square in one direction, central ark in the other. Hotel room was a little small, but clean. Service desk people very helpful and efficient, spent time to help us with our Fort Lauderdale hotel and flight connections during Hurricane Irma. The doorman always had a tip for places to drink, and the bar man Juliano has a little Black book of the best places to eat at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend a stay at the Ameritania Hotel.;5
Our family of five had an incredible time staying at this beautiful Riad. The staff looked after every need and in particular, Elena and Sara did an outstanding job of caring for us. Elena was always checking with us to make sure we were happy and Sara went over and above in providing staff to show us to different spots throughout the Medina. They both knew and called each of our family by name which certainly adds a nice touch of service. Must compliment the staff on providing free laundry service which we all took advantage of after the hot days spent walking around to see the sights. The terrace was very nice and we all spent a lot of time around the plunge pool and the comfortable couches and chairs. We had our daily breakfast up top and we're well looked after each day by;5
Hotel set in a great location, with lots of bars , restaurants and subway round the corner. Rooms very clean, beds so comfortable and hotel easy to navigate round. But Jeff and Javier made our stay so rememberable. Jeff so happy, positive and just brings a smile to our faces. His memory is awesome too ! Javier our Mexican bar tender, just a wonderful man. Totally looked after my sister and made the end of our fathers birthday the best. Thank you gentlemen. You are worth your weight in gold how hard you work and how wonderful you make people feel. Keep doing what your doing !;5
We recently had a large group of guests at the Empire Hotel.  It was an amazing experience with 60+ rooms and 100 guests we would always go back.  Michelle Lu in Sales is SO easy to work with, asks questions before you even think of them, and has lots of experience managing large groups.  Yuri in concierge was great.  Simon, one of the hotel managers, was super helpful over the weekend.  I am certain that the next time we have a group event in NYC, we will be back at the Empire.;5
We stayed here the 2nd weekend in December.  We had a group of 4 and stayed in a room with 2 dbl beds. The picture online is a little deceiving..... Way smaller than we thought.  Enough room for the beds and a little space left over (the beds were comfy tho!). The bathroom was the smallest I ve seen in a hotel room. That being said and realizing it s New York City with space at a premium we enjoyed our stay here.  We had a great view of the Empire State Building. It s also in a great location. 10 minute walk to Rockefeller center, Macy's, and Time Square.  New York City at Christmas time is truly amazing. I would definitely stay here again.;5
Thanks at Jalal who give us many good advice and being really nice to us , he was really helpful We are appreciated . All the staff are nice thanks very much ! It was my second time in this hotel and itâs always a good moment ! Near to everything , 10 min walking to time square !   The only bad thing itâs about the noise in the hallways with the doors slamming many times early in the morning itâs annoying   Anyway except that itâs was a really good place;5
We had a wonderful stay at the Empire.  I would highly recommend staying here.  Canât wait to come back.  The location of the hotel to points in walking distance is great.  Thereâs even a Starbucks on the corner.;5
This was our second visit to the New Yorker Hotel, the first being some years ago when a power outage hit the whole of the Eastern seaboard. This visit was less tense! The hotel is famous for being the last home of the scientist, Tesla. There is a plaque on his room...3327...and an exhibition in the basement. The hotel exudes Art Deco splendour in the public areas, while the rooms retain a sort of faded beauty. People return time and time again...we've already made reservations for our next trip...and it is easy to see why...it's built for comfort, in a great location, the staff are friendly and helpful...may she long reign as the Grande Dame of Manhattan!;5
There aren't enough superlatives to describe this riad. Once you step though the little black door, it's like you've been enveloped in a giant hug. The building is amazing - so many routes to discover and nooks to explore - but the staff are even better. Everyone is warm and friendly, and they've perfected the art of making you feel at home, only this home has tremendous food, stunning rooms, and people who will organise activities and provide recommendations for, well, anything you ask for. I'd say the only thing the staff can't plan for is Morocco doing so well in the World Cup, and that was really just gilding the lily!  Other reviews cover things like the mobile phone, the guide, the breakfast, the massages: they're all 100% accurate. For us, it was meant to be a once in a;5
When we arrived from the hotel we were greeted with a friendly manner and welcomed to the hotel. We checked in and the staff behind the reception were very helpful. The rooms are lovely and with great views (we had a view of the Lincoln centre) very clean and modern hotel. It's about 1-2 minutes from Central Park and 5-10 minute walk to time square so it's in a great location. Far enough from the hustle and bustle but close enough to get to it. There is a tube station at the Lincoln centre so you can hop on and it will take you to where you need to get to in no time. It cost $2.75 a trip no matter how far you go. We went for our honeymoon/ 1 year anniversary and on the day they put a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolate strawberry in the room which was a lovely surprise.;5
This place is awesome! Got upgraded to a beautiful suite when me and my family checked in. We were tired from spending the whole day at Universal, but walking into our room put a big smile in our face! I live up the road in Burbank but needed one more stay before the end of the year to get to Diamond status. This stay certainly made me feel like I was already a Diamond member! The service there was exceptional. From check-in to check-out I felt like a VIP. The personnel at the front desk, restaurant, and bar were all friendly and very attentive. I will definitely be back soon. Thanks to all the staff at the Hilton Universal for their outstanding customer service!  Sincerely,  The Diaz Family;5
Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and fantastic concierge  Upgrade was given as we explained it was a special occasion for us. The views from the room where great and we would definitely use and recommend this hotel;5
We really enjoyed our three nights at the Ameritania it is a very old hotel that has definitely been renovated to be more modern. The room is cozy and did the trick for what we needed. Will say that their all of their bellmen were incredibly kind and welcoming and Jeff quickly became our favorite. Also the hotel is incredibly convenient to walking to various subways and easy trek to Times Square. We would definitely stay again!;5
This was the 4th or 5th time I have stayed at this property... I will continue to stay here and I will continue to recommend to anyone who asks (I work for an airline so I get asked a lot) With that said.... this time, I had some issues - livable but still issues... maybe I should have brought it up.  We were in a room OUTSIDE the regular hallways (Kind of in the emergency stairwell areas) the door didn't open completely so it was a bit hard to get in and out of the room, especially with our luggage. The beds were comfortable and slept well but in the bathroom, we could not get regulated water temperature... no hot water at all in the sink and showering was a dance between being scalded and really super cold. Again while not pleasant, nothing I couldn't handle.  The staff is;5
Leaving my family for a work trip is never easy or fun but my recent stay at the Empire Hotel in NY made it more than ok. First I was checked in by Nick at the front desk who was awesome -- friendly, nice, helpful. Second the room was perfect -- clean, big TV, comfortable, plenty of outlets. Third room service (grilled chicken cesear, red wine) was yummy and fast. And finally location was perfect -- nothing like running in Central Park and walking to my meetings!  Thanks Empire!!;5
This is a very well run and staffed hotel in a perfect location.  My room was ample, pristine, and modestly priced.  I can't say enough about the helpfulness of the staff, from the doormen to the desk to housekeeping.  Many thanks.;5
Wow what an amazing place. So glad we found this Riad. It was our first visit to Morroco and the whole experience was made absolutely perfect thanks to all the amazing staff at Riad Kheirredine. From the moment they met us at the square and then completely looked after from then on. They bent over backwards to help our every need and nothing was to much trouble. It's an execllent location walking distant to all medina, restaurants, gardens. The boys from the Riad where always on hand to escort you where ever you wanted to go and come and collect you.They where very accomodating in arranging all our trips and guides. Breakfast was lovely and plentiful. Food at the Riad was excellent. We had an amazing 2 hour spa treatments which was amazing. It was my wife's 50th birthday and;5
Exceptional customer service from Jerome (Front Desk), Ezra (Lobby Lounge) and Maya, Marine, Roberto, Eduardo and Nicolas (Pool Deck).   Food excellent, location perfect for Universal weekend  Shuttle running between Universal and Hotel was punctual and convenient;5
This Read is such a great place. All the people who are working there are so kindly and we felled like in a family. So friendly, so competent and always there to help us. The room was just perfect and really really clean. We had two times dinner there and also aperitif - high level of food...the spaghetti's are real Italian spaghetti's - we liked it so much and of course also the Moroccan food - was delicious. We also got a mobile phone from the hotel in case we wouldn't find the way back. We had so much fun with the girls from the reception (specially Asma and Imen) but also the italian working girls are so nice. Thanks again for everthing - we will come back...Dagmar, ZÃ¼rich;5
Just returned from a visit to celebrate my wife's 70th birthday. Fantastic location 10M off Broadway and a short walk to Times Square, excellent for access to the theatres. The hotel is very clean, decent sized bedrooms and bathrooms, and the staff very pleasant and helpful, special mention for Jeff the doorman.;5
I travel to NYC for business every month. I have stayed at the Ameritania at least 10 times over the past two years. I love that this hotel is in a great location in Manhattan. The bar and lounge area are cozy and comforting after a long day of work. The hotel rooms are always very clean and the gym is small but functional. This past visit was exceptionally enjoyable because Alexis from the front desk went above and beyond to make my stay the best it could be. She helped accommodate my room issue, she provided insight on things to do in the area, and she consistently remembered my name when I came to the front desk. This hotel feels like my home away from home, and Alexis made that happen.  If you are looking for a cozy, clean, comfortable, well designed hotel with a great staff;5
Checking in seemed to be nice but routine, we get to our room and when we turned on the bathroom light the bulb blew!  Called down to front desk and a tech came in and changed bulb within about 10-15mins.  Then we seen that we had a room designed for handicap.  I called down to front desk and spoke with Evan.  He was very apologetic, and upgraded our room to a Jr Suite for inconvenience!  This will now be our place to stay when traveling to NYC!!! We had a great view, and very comfortable room and the location is great for sightseeing and shopping!!!;5
Heck in was great as we were offered to wait for a room. This was at 10 AM when checking was at 3 PM. We were called by the hotel to see if all was well, it was. Security was great as they were not allowing vagrants or homeless in. Rom was fantastic. Dining area was great. Only thing.  No coffee pot at room for wake up morning coffee. This was an exceptional stay with no problems;5
after reading ALOT of poor reviews i got a brilliant price for this place so bit the bullet and went for it as it was super cheap and pretty close to Hollywood. The place is great! let us check in early, professional staff, gym, laundry room, steam room, pool. Rooms are decent size, nicely furnished, huge shower cubicle and balcony that you can see the Hollywood Sign from. Only downside is the location, its near nothing except for the wrong end of Hollywood BLVD. (However all of L.A. appears to be spread out a little bit) Breakfast was ok, cereals, waffles, egg and sausage. Parking was only $15 too. Im not sure if i was just lucky? but had a great three nights!;5
The placeÂ´s awsome, the staff always helpful and kind and the shared bathrooms were always clean and pleasant, just like my room. I'll certainly be there in my next trip to NYC.;5
We absolutely loved staying in this hotel when we spent a week in New York last year. The hotel was situated opposite Maddison Square Garden and was a short walk to Times Square, I think we timed it as 8 minutes. We felt that staying here gave us a lot of choice. We had plenty of things planned but we could be quite flexible and add in things or go back to the hotel quickly to change after a day of exploring.  Our bed was just lush and after a day of taking  it all in I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. I loved the style of the bathroom and the shower had fantastic pressure.  Tip- the elevators are super busy at peak times so you can either have to wait a long time to get down to the ground floor or up to your room. Give yourself plenty of time if you have a reservation or a;5
Took the family to Universal studios for the holiday.  Hotel and staff were very friendly and helpful.  Rescued puppy at last minute while near there and staff got us in pet friendly room and concierge and front desk staff were very helpful.  Shuttle every 15 minutes to park food was good and atmosphere very festive.  Recommend this place and will stay there again;5
My wife and I have been fortunate enough to stay in a number of beautiful hotels but Riad Kheirredine beats them all. The welcome we received was fantastic, the hospitality was second to none (Thanks in particular go to Khalid and Marco) and the Riad itself is beautiful. In what is an energetic and sometimes chaotic city, the Riad provides an oasis of calm and luxury.  On arrival we were provided with a mobile to use should we need to contact the Riad (no extra charge - amazing service). At night we used this to notify the staff we were returning and they would always send someone to meet us and walk us along the dark streets to the door of the Riad. On our first day we were guided into the city by Marco (who speaks 10 languages fluently - quite incredible to witness) who showed;5
Excellent location and service, and room was nice and good-sized.  We had a great city view from the 11th floor in our Deluxe King.  Everyone was very nice and helpful.  The rooftop pool and lounge was cool.;5
I was a bit weary with this hotel at first, but man was I wrong! Yes, the rooms are small. that being said, who goes to NYC to stay in their hotel room? Not me! I stayed with two girlfriends and had a blast. The front desk is a bit short on the phone, but they are helpful. We called down for ice several times during our stay and it was delivered promptly. This hotel is right on central park, literally, just cross the street. It is also close to two subway stations. I will definately be staying here again.;5
Easy walk or shuttle ride to LAX for our overnight stay before our next flight and this hotel room was perfect for our needs. Comfortable beds, huge bathroom and the staff were really friendly and helpful. What more could we ask for?;5
We stayed for its proximity to Universal Studios and as a treat for our last night in the US. From the concierge to Reception staff we felt so welcomed! Our room was on the 21st floor, had amazing views! The bed was soooo comfortable, I really felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. The room itself was lovely. Was such a short walk to Universal Studios. With the accomm continental breakfast was included. Upon reading other reviews and recommendations we upgraded to full breaky for extra $9 extra per person. Reception had given us a voucher for 10% off at the restaurant, but when we went to use voucher we couldn't. All sorted in the end, but just to let you know voucher not redeemable for the $9 extra person breakfast. Otherwise stay was terrific!;5
excellent service and hospitality and friendly staff clean rooms . and great view of the empire state building valet parking was great and charges  were reduced for  excellent wifi and close  to everything by  walking;5
This hotel is in an amazing location to access all attractions you would want to see for a first time visit. Yes rooms are a little tired but for the money you pay well worth it. The rooms are clean and warm with very hot water for the shower.  The staff have been excellent throughout our 5 day trip and very helpful in offering travel advice for subway etc. The hotel room walls are a little thin and you can here next door running the shower but that did not cause us any issues. Would definitely recommend!;5
Very convenient for an overnight stay before flying from LAX. Globalist recognition was above and beyond. Got bottled waters, upgraded to Regency Suite and complimentary breakfast was provided at 5am from the coffee shop because the buffet was still close.  Staff and very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended. Will definitely stay again.;5
I had a great experience at the Hilton Universal City.  The hotel is nice, room was very nice and comfortable.  The staff were especially pleasant and helpful, and made the stay even better.  Room service was great! Only downside is the location near Universal Studios (and not near much else unless you want to fight Hollywood Bowl traffic on 101 every night to head into Hollywood area).  They could use a second restaurant and/or more diverse and healthy food options, given their location isn't near any other real options, if you don't want to fight millions of tourists to dine at cheesy chain restaurants at Universal Studios across the street.;5
Excellent experience especially at check in with Sarah, Herman and Adam. Apparently they're all personal friendly gave me excellent suggestions offered to carry me around if I had trouble with my legs. Just kidding on that last.;5
Great price, great location, excellent pool and jacuzzi (Open til midnight). Just a nice experience. Only stayed one night, but I will be back. They provide shuttle to Universal studios, but we also walked it in 5 minutes. The tower has excellent views of surrounding areas. I recommend this Hotel.;5
5th stay and just keeps getting better. Stayed with family for 4 nights in May. Fab room on 37th floor with views of ESB. Really special. Staff friendly and check in process quick and dealt with all of requests. Great location. Tick tock brilliant. Bathrooms could do with an update but will not stop  me from returning. Love this hotel. Will be back !;5
Stayed here to go to Universal Hollywood and it was so close and had a shuttle. Staff were so friendly and happy. Really liked this hotel. It was easy to get to and the parking was easy. Hotel bar was cozy but a bit pricey.;5
If a grand five star 1920's Hotel and a high end european Hostel had a child this would be their offspring. Only deep in new york city would a concept like this ever work or be as awesome as this. Away from the tourist buzz in chelsea this gem is a great alternative for the experienced new york traveler! Lets just say upfront I am not sure if the rooms could be smaller or the experience more closterfobic in them, there is nothing more new york then this! The room I stayed at with a friend was a 2 bunk room more like something you would find on a ship and nothing like a hotel stay. Its about as small as one could get! But the experience alone is wonderful in this unique little vintage gem. Warning to light sleepers the doors close really hard and noisy so if you are a light;5
What a great stay at the Hollywood Hotel and blondy made it just that extra special. Pil is a wonderful staff member we will return to visit next time in Hollywood. Always smiling and charming. Our stay exceeded our expectations and highly recommended the Hollywood hotel.;5
Stayed 4 nights April 2016 with my teenagers as part of a visit to LA to tour USC & UCLA. Hotel is well located, nice facilities, very clean, great buffet meals available in the lobby. Walking access to Universal Studios & Citywalk is a bonus, parking is not cheap but very easy. Easy to get around the city, close to Griffith Park, Laurel Canyon, Hollywood, etc. Very happy with our stay, would gladly stay again.;5
This is a really nice hotel for the price. The staff was friendly and the service was great. Itâs clean, immaculate and well kept. The bathroom is updated and art deco. The TVs are a little small, but itâs a very nice place for the price. We were extremely please with the staff member who helped us. We had we didnât like the room we got and Elias was more than happy to accommodate us. Thank you!!!! Danny;5
With Hyatt you will always be satisfied. The quality of service and cleanliness the attention they give you is always the best, the staff are there for you at all times, like they say: they aim to please!!;5
After a long drive, I was welcomed graciously, and the service throughout the stay was top-notch!  The room ,and facilities were clean, and slick.  THANK YOU!;5
As always, Hyatt continues to set the standard (in my opinion).  Being a world of hyatt member, earning points is easy and add up quickly.  I love the different hyatt hotel options across the country and have not had a bad experience in any of them.;5
My organization had booked a reservation with a third party for this week. We've had to cancel due to the coronavirus outbreak and it has been a hassle dealing with the third party but the staff at the New Yorker have been absolutely amazing. They have been so gracious and helpful in getting us the assistance we have been needing. In particular Naida has been such an amazing help. She has been so patient in working with me to get this resolved as quickly and as expertly as possible. Her warmth and friendliness on the phone has been very helpful during this difficult time!   Thanks for all your help!  Karina;5
Great hotel in a great location, right in the middle of the action of times Square and really handy for theatre and broadway. Also walking distance to many popular tourist attractions and great food and shopping right on the doorstep.   Staff were all very friendly an knowledgable, particularly Jeff who sorted out transport back to the airport for us when we were having some trouble with a company we were using.  The room itself was clean and spacious, and we benefited by getting a free upgrade on arrival to a slightly bigger room then we were expecting.   Only negative for us was having to pay for WiFi to use in the rooms, though this is not unusual. We also struggled to be able to connect both our phones despite having paid for WiFi on 2 devices.  We didnât use the breakfast;5
Short trip to NYC with my son and we stayed in the New Yorker. Itâs a bit tired but the process of updating rooms has started so it will be better in time. This said, we had everything we needed.  The location was central. Within walking distance of all we wanted. Our room had 2 queen size beds. We looked down towards the Hudson River. Our bathroom had the best shower ever. Plenty of towels, travel size toiletries and a hairdryer. Coffee and creamer was provided as well. Staff were always pleasant. Itâs a great place to stay.;5
We like this hotel for its excellent staff, they gave us excellent addresses and information on places to visit, they explained our room and the activities to do, good size room, functional bathroom, varied breakfast and more. Excellent value;5
"I typically don't write reviews, but when I checked into the Hilton, it was my fifth hotel over four cities and 12 days on the road, so I was feeling a bit road weary when Stuart greeted me at check-in with a ""welcome back"" before he even looked up my reservation--and I hadn't been at the hotel in over five years.  We made small talk which included that my stay was going to be days 12-14 and then home, and Stuart surprised me with an upgrade to a magnificent room saying he wanted this to be the best hotel experience of my trip.  The whole hotel is great... it has the amenities of a vacation place with the conveniences for business, but what a treat.  Stuart then went the extra mile by calling my room shortly after I got there to make sure it was okay, plus the hotel delivered a";5
Would give anything to be back in this Awesome city, it was everything we expected and more, staff at the days inn made our stay extremely easy, as 2 young girls it was scary to approach but the tourist kiosk in the reception directed us and helped us a lot. Rooms were comfy clean and everything you need for a short stay. Will be staying here again when we come back I <3 NY;5
Stayed here with my wife and two children (6 yr old daughter and 12 yr old son) on 8/26/12. First and foremost, this place was had everything we wanted and more.  So close to Universal Studios..even has a shuttle every 15 minutes.  You could actually walk there in 5 mins or less. The dining experience, hands down was the best buffet ever!! Kevin (Restauran Mgr) was so kind and informatve, he was generous enough to extend the hours because we showed up 15 mins before closing time which he extend for an additional 1/2 hour which was more than plenty. Our server Deanne was also equally pleasant and accommodating.  She even came to aid us on carrying out our plates and even asked the chef to prepare us a fresh cut of Prime Rib.  The staff treated us like royalty even though we are;5
Friend and I are fairly late planners, and ended up booking this hostel a mere few weeks before travelling. Found it on a google search, and when we saw the front of the hostel we were a bit wary, and since we live so close to London anyway we decided to have a day trip up and go visit the hostel to see what it was like. All fears were swept aside ! The staff were so helpful ! We were shown an example of each type of room on offer, and had all of our questions answered so politely.  This was early October, and they seemed to be in the middle of moving their reception area, but the hall ways were kept clear enough to walk down even though there was a lot of work clearly going on. We booked our room, the double ensuite, and turned up at the end of October. The chap behind the desk;5
My stay at the hotel was smooth thanks to Gustavo. Great customer service. He was very polite & friendly. Rooms are very cleaning. Location is great & close to Hollywood. Check them out when close by.;5
Fantastic hotel room. Being New York, I was expecting a small cramped room, this was not the case, our room was large with an area with a tea and coffee machine. The bathroom was small but adequate with bath robes. Our room was on the 7th floor and was quite, no street noise, although our room was not at the front. Staff were lovely, check in was friendly, Linda H  on check in was very welcoming and upgraded us. Concierge staff very helpful in assisting us to navigate the train system, giving us a map and advising us on the best way to get to where we wanted to go. On checkout the doorman arranged a taxi to the airport for us while we sat in the comfort of the hotel.  Beautiful comfortable foyer where I met a friend for coffee on the comfortable sofas.  Great location easily;5
My brother and I stay at the Jane everytime we come to NYC to see concerts/sight see/experience wonderful NYC night life. We are from Nova Scotia and we absolutely love the Jane! Fabulous staff, awesome neighbourhood, lovely restaurant inside the Jane and great bar! Hotel has all the amenities that boutique hotels have to offer. Jamie, front desk manager and front desk staff are very helpful in making our stay pleasant, comfortable and stress-free! We canât wait to arrive this Saturday June 1 to see Billy Joel!      Allan Baggio Nova Scotia, Canada;5
The staff is incredibly helpful and courteous. It's clean and a great location.  I stay here for business and while I am in town for personal travel with family and friends.  I don't like staying anywhere else and they really make you feel comfortable.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable, too.;5
Stayed here for a week in February, and it was as good as we could ask for.  The breakfast is perfect, ESPECIALLY considering it is continental.  Aside from one man who worked the night shift, who came across as very Rude, everyone was very helpful.  This was especially the case when 1 Lady, Gisel Hernandez.  I had arranged for flowers to be in the room for my girlfriend when we first showed up, and Gisel helped me coordinate this and had them placed on the dresser for me.  This is one service that I know not all hotel staff at any location would be willing to help with, and it was a great overall gesture to aid the friendly environment.  I would stay here again for sure!;5
Sorry for the delay in the review of my favorite NYC rest spot. I have been going to this establishment for several years and at every instant, I was always warmly received and felt like a valued patron. There may not be any room service, but with all the restaurants and coffee shops in the vicinity, who really needs it. The rooms are well-appointed and the service to refresh them on a daily basis is excellent. Check-in is rapid and friendly. The lobby is beautiful and there is a bar in the lobby and for the jet-setters, the is a wonderful rooftop lounge/bar with a spectacular view of Lincoln Center. It is overall cozy and truly comfortable. Excellent location by the way.;5
We had a large group for a 2 night stay and it was great! From the moment we arrived we were greeted by Jeff at the front door and he helped us non-stop for the remainder of our visit. Everything from restaurants, maps, where to go and setting up transportation, Jeff had us covered! Highly recommend.;5
We stayed at the hotel on Friday evening 18th November for 1 night. I chose this hotel for the location close to the London eye as we knew we would be going on this the next day along with a river cruise. The staff we dealt with were very friendly and let us store our luggage both days which was fab. The room was basic but clean and warm. Breakfast absolutely fantastic! We chose to eat on the Friday night for ease but I must say this wasnât too good, it took abs age and was cold/not fantastic quality. But the breakfast was superb!! I defo would stay here again just wouldnât have dinner. Wish weâd of known there is fish and chips round the other side! Or there is an all bar one and slug lettuce right round the corner. Value for money was great;5
Brilliant location with fantastic staff especially Julian & Jeff the doormen great help & advice on where to visit & where to eat couldnât be more helpful all the staff were great, room was exactly what was needed for the trip will definitely be back;5
This was my second visit to the Wyndham New Yorker, my first being in February of last year with friends, this year however I took my Mum for her first trip to New York for her 60th! I couldn't fault this hotel at all. Has the nicest staff ever so helpful! Super central to attractions, subway and bus terminal. Has great facilities as well but the only one we made use of was the Tick Tock diner which is lovely! The rooms were clean and had the comfiest beds ever! On arrival we were upgraded to a city view with 2 double beds and opposed to 1 as I had let them know of my mum's birthday prior to arriving so I'm thankful that they managed to do something memorable for us. I'm already looking into my next visit I love it! Realised I never took pictures of the room but I do have one of;5
Great hotel to stay with very helpful staff, clean, close to airport, good rooms, good food. Very clean, Brand new room, great views. Recommended to everyone. Amazing staffing , helpful, upgraded our room.;5
Stayed here last month for 5 days with my wife and 4 year old daughter . The location is perfect for visiting Universal studios and using the hotel for a base to explore LA. Room was the perfect size for the 3 of us . The hotel has a fabulous pool and spa area with plenty of lounges to relax on , there is even cabanas for rent if you'd like a bit more privacy . I cant comment on the bar/restaurant as we didn't eat there during our stay . There is a shuttle bus that runs between Universal City Walk and the hotel (and the Sheraton) and is every 15 minutes or so. Starline Tours also pick up from the hotel for tours into hollywood and beyond which was extremely handy too . My only piece of criticism would be the lack of a guest laundry but not many higher end hotels such as this;5
Good hotel nice place to stay for Japan es travelers Staff very helpful, pil help me with airport transportation so I go back home with no problem. Breakfast is very big and good. Thank you Hollywood hotel.;5
Wow what can I say! Everything about this riad was incredible. The staff were completely accommodating from the moment we arrived in Marrakech. We arrived at about 11am and got an airport transfer to the hotel, and once we arrived they had kindly put a breakfast (which was delicious) on for us as they said they knew we would be hungry! We immediately felt that the service at this riad was going to be top notch.   The riad is beautiful and the rooms were spacious, lovely and clean. There was also a turn down service at night, which again shows the level of attention that the hotel provides to their guests.   Other things the riad did really well:  - they provided a mobile phone to call the reception at any point in case of getting lost in the MÃ©dina etc - amazing breakfast with;5
The Ameritania completely exceeded our expectations! A well decorated Queen sized room was perfect as a base for my daughter's 21st birthday trip to New York.  The lobby looked  like the photos but probably looked more classy in person with ample seating and was beautifully decorated.  Coffee was served in the mornings between 9 & 10am. At the time of our visit the bar wasn't open.   The bedroom was beautifully decorated and the wet room was enormous! A fantastic double shower provided plentiful hot water and the central heating could be personally adapted to suit the individual's needs depending on who was staying in the room.    There was a safety deposit box and the queen sized bed was honestly like sleeping on clouds.    Shower gel, body lotion and shampoo/conditioner came;5
I can only repeat what has been said already, this riad is superb.  It is located in the old medina with many residential homes in the surrounding alleys which mean that you get a real experience of the strong sense of community in the local area-something you would not get in one of the new/large hotels outside of the old city walls.  There are no points of constructive criticism of how the riad could be improved, it is that good! The staff all go out of their way to assist you with everything you need and ensuring you get the best experience out of your stay.  We will come back here again!;5
We stayed for one night whilst visiting Hollywood.  The room was very clean and the beds were very comfy.  Secure parking down below, and it was only a short walk to Universal Studios.  We didn't have breakfast, but Universal City is only a walk away.;5

Hyatt Regency LAX provides exceptional service, pays attention to details and goes out of their way to make you happy. Their  valet is attentive, the Guest Services line literally picks up on the second ring and the property is immaculate!;5
Hotel is perfectly clean and room is very spacious.Service was wonderful and lovely. staff were friendly and helpful.Hotel is close to many attractions.Bed was very comfortable. Internet was storng and great. We will be back.;5
Hadii (not sure if that is the spelling) as soon as he saw me with my big suitcase, he was so helpful to taking it up to my room.  Always service with a smile.    Everyone here is so nice.  Great room and awesome location to Restaurants.  Starbucks on the corner and Smith's restaurant across the street.   Hotel reminds me of the old Hollywood Glam.;5
Coming to Marrakech for the first time, what a great experience at this hotel. Elena and her staff are the best. I have never had better service. The decor, the rooms and the food was great. They really know how to make you feel welcome and cared for in this unique and exotic city. I can't wait to return and stay with them again.;5
Beautiful hotel. Be prepared to pay for parking. Parking fees were, $55.00 per night to valet or $21.00 per night to park in the garage. The garage is close to the hotel but hotel guests are required to park on the top floors.;5
Empire Hotel overlooks Lincoln Center which is a convenient location to exploring all of NYC.  It has a hip vibe and very professional service.  Nick, who greeted me with a friendly smile when I checked in, started my stay off with humor as well as professional service.  The room I had was small but comfortable, with an awesome bed and designer soaps.  The decor was somewhere between Hollywood Regency and Moderne combined to stylish effect.  The bar is rockin' and they make a decent Martini!  Empire is festive, fun and friendly.  I highly recommend it!  Please say hi to Nick for me when you go!;5
For what will come to be 21 days of stay at the Hollywood Hotel, I have experienced nothing but possibly the best service I have ever encountered whilst staying at a hotel. The staff are so welcoming and helpful, my room was great and I almost felt as though I was at a home away from home. My favorite part of my stay was the complimentary breakfast the hotel offers for guests. They had such a great variety of food options and the staff at the restaurant, particularly Hugo, Juan and Sonia, were absolutely amazing. They are so so friendly and really do brighten up your morning.   The hotel itself was aesthetically charming although had it been located elsewhere it would probably harbor better views. The best view I could find from the hotel was on the third floor balcony but there;5
We spent 3 nights at Hilton Universal as we were attending the VIP Experience at Universal Studios. We had attended the Studios a couple of times before, but did not like the travel from Anaheim and then not having any time at the end of the day before having to adhere to the return bus trip to Anaheim.  With travel from Anaheim, makes this a long 12+ hour day. The VIP Experience is expensive, but it made the day so memorable.  The Hilton was so convenient. It was a free shuttle ride to Universal City Walk and then we would walk back to the hotel, which only took 7 minutes and it was a lovely downhill walk. The rooms were a lovely size with views over Universal Studios front entrance and freeway. The only thing about this hotel is some noise travelled into the room from the;5
We had a swell time at the hotel my family are night owls and we went out every night almost with no troubles at all. Fellow gentlemen Jermaine working the night shift gave us some great whereabouts and they were good. Walking around is fine at night and the area isnt that bad. Hollywood blvd isnt a walk inthe park either but its entertaining! I enjoyed the hotel and what it has to offer!;5
We loved this Hotel.Really nice Staff, Heated Pool 2 mins from Universal/City walk.Best part was the Lobby lounge loved sitting at the Bar chatting to Bar Staff & other guests.Metro train station at the bottom of the hill .;5
We drove to NYC, and from the moment we arrived to the time we departed, staff at every level and every station were friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable, and room attendants were always ready to assist. We appreciated the central location, the convenience for both walking and subway, and the overall value of staying at the New Yorker. We will surely stay again.;5
I loved my stay at the Empire. It's in a great location, the room had everything that i needed & the staff were helpful throughout my stay. I'll 100% be going back at the first opportunity. The barman makes a great cocktail.;5
Had a very fast and friendly check-in.  Room was clean, large, and very comfortable.  Hotel is across the street from Universal Studios...literally just across the street, so City Walk and Universal are very easily accessible by foot.  The location is great for business or vacation! Very easy to get to.  Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in the area.;5
i loved this hotel, very nice and quiet but at the same time with a lot of life. very chic and elegant. the rooms are stuning, the location is perfect ...next to central park, restautantes, etc...   the hotel has a nightclub and you don't have to wait in line to enter if you are staying at the hotel, on the roof there is a  swimming pool and a chill out place to enjoy the evening after a long day of walking.   finally, for me was  excellent, I loved it ,  the only downside  for me was the price, it is quite expensive, the night is 300 euros and up , but it is new york , soooo everithing  is expensive!;5
Check-in was very quick  beds were very comfortable and bathroom was excellent with big spacious shower we were on 10th floor and didn't find the street noise a problem safe battery low warning was on and after a quick visit to reception someone was there within 5 mins to fix it. great location for getting around everywhere. The doormen Julian and Hugo were both very helpful at giving us directions and great tips on places to eat. room was cleaned everyday of our 6 night stay only complaint I had was that there was no kettle in room for to make tea in room when returning after a long day out however tea and coffee are available free in breakfast room in the morning  I would not hesitate to return to this hotel and will be recommending it to friends and family thankyou for making;5
I just wanted to express my deepest gratitude and delight of staying at Empire Hotel NYC again.  Both Michael Stewart and Holly G made my stay Awesome and So Comfortable.... Kudos for both of them, as they make my stay so Memorable and Amazing.  In addition to the Super Exciting July 4th Fireworks at Brooklyn Bridge, we had sooo much FUN at Saturday night Roof Top Party!  Empire Hotel NYC definitely made me Very Happy 4th of July 2015!  Highly Recommended, as they always exceed my expectations...... Top Notch First Class!;5
We stayed 2 weeks in room 3139 which had great views over the Hudson River. Room wasn't huge but had bags of character (including proper closet!) and was clean with comfy beds. Air con was a godsend as it was still hot in NYC. The hotel has brown painted doors and terrazo floors plus many art deco features. If you like bland and modern you'll not like this. But if you want a hotel that is like NYC - friendly and bustling with energy, you'll love the New Yorker. The location is perfect - opposite Penn Station, near Port Authority bus terminal, a short walk to Macy's, Times Square and Empire State Building. Two stores - Duane Reade and CVS - are opposite for any essentials. If you can bear to shun the marvellous Tick Tock Diner there is a Dunkin Donuts and Maccy D's near. The;5
Had a great two night stay whilst visiting Universal Studios. Staff on the front desk, bar and customer services (bought universal fol tickets) were extremely helpful and friendly. Carlos, on the bar, was full of tips and good conversation, working hard each night.  The room was very big and comfortable with a great bed and views of the city. Easy walk from the metro and walk to the park. If visiting Universal, stay here. You also beat the crowds from other hotels in the park, meaning we got in to rides first thing with hardly anyone around!;5
We had a great Labor Day weekend stay at Hilton Universal City Hollywood.  I can't say enough about the staff here, from the front desk to the Doorman, Tim.  We were greeted with friendly smiles everytime we would pass an employee and asked if they could do anything they could do for you. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and pillows for good a night of sleep. The location is a 5 minute walk to Universal Hollywood or you can take a complimentary shuttle to Universal City Walk. I would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
Exceptional service at this updated Hyatt property. It tastefully decorated with all the latest amenities and is very soundproof. The only hotel I choose when needing a room convenient to the airport as a home base;5
I made a reservation for 1 night and didnât expect much but this hotel is really top. From the customer service by Pil to the rooms that are fully remodeled ( room 312) we got the breakfast that is made for top 10 hotels and itâs included. Itâs not about all that itâs how they respect the customers is what is worth any price you pay. Much love to everyone.;5
Outstanding!  Clean, friendly and hospitality focused. You wonât beat the location. Surprisingly great cafe express inside the hotel with great food and full range of beverages.  Solid wine and spirits choices and high quality teas to enjoy.  Thoroughly happy with this hotel experience.;5
If you are checking into the Empire Hotel in NYC, look for Pasquale at the front desk!! My wife and I were in the middle of a very difficult personal family crisis, and he truly made an extremely challenging day one that we were able to be thankful for.  Thank you Sir...you have enabled us to face tomorrow with much more energy and hope!!;5
What a great location for a London city break. We booked a premier plus room and it was definitely worth it. In both rooms we had issues with the shower which we reported but nothing was done about it. That was the only negative, everything else about this hotel was spot on!;5
Having just arrived from the Flamingo in Las Vegas it was a relief to find friendly staff and good service. Hotel is nice and clean with secure parking and a decent pool. Was well looked after by Gust in the bar!  Whilst not central it is a 5 minute walk from the tube station so you can be in central Hollywood within 20 - 30 mins. Bear in mind that the reasonable price more than justifies this if you want to stay in LA on a reasonable budget.;5
Good hotel in a great place and price . The hotel is very clean , close to the pen station and other subways stations. The room that we get has a great view to 34 street and the Empire state building.;5
If you're going to Universal Studios then staying here is a no brainer. It's located on premises and just a short 5 minute walk to the main gate. The room I was given on an executive floor was huge! The breakfast buffet is the best I've seen and the happy hour snacks in the lounge were awesome. The icing is that the staff are all attentive and courteous making this hotel a great place to stay.;5
OK I was there for business and must say from the time I entered and was greeted by the staff, it was terrific!! Much praise to Nicole for star treatment. Loved the breakfast buffet (How do you want your omelet!) which lasts till 10:30 (Bless you all!!), loved the pool and area around it.  Room was comfortable with all the appropriate amenities.  I'd stay again easily!!!;5
This is a very nice hotel to stay in Hollywood. This was our second stay here and Brian at the desk has always been very nice. The area is not the best but not the fault of the hotel and even if it looks not so nice we never had any problems in the hotel.;5
New York we loved it there and I would go again and again we had 3 weeks there and done so much we had a car and drove down to Canada for a day trip we spent so much money on shopping you will never get bored there is so much to do;5
I stayed 4 nights in this charming and clean hotel. Good relation quality-price.;5
The service at Kheirredine is what takes this place from special to extraordinary.  The staff, especially Valentina, often anticipate your needs before you do.  They are always looking for ways to make your stay special or help you find whatever you are looking for in Marrakech - be it cooking classes, massages, or a special place to eat.  We chose the hotel because of the tripadvisor reviews and like many others, we were not disappointed.  The rooms were great, the food was great, the service was great.  The only downside is the distance to Jemma El Fnaa but I wonder if those Riads that are closer pay so much attention to detail and go so far to provide you with so much attention that you feel not only like family but rather the respected elder.;5
We were here for a meeting and the hotel was tremendous.  They were great on planning our meeting and the onsite support was fantastic.   The rooms were clean and overall service was great.  I would highly recommend for staying for leisure or for a business meeting;5
My mom and I stayed for 9 nights at the Hollywood Hotel and loved everyday. The staff is friendly and always available to answer any questions. Particularly Pil, he does live up to his reviews. Always friendly and smiling is able to speak Spanish which is a big help to tourist. The area is a bit dark but safe to walk around and easy to get to train and busses. Breakfast was amazing and the staff are always on top of everything. My mom and I enjoyed it very much. Hope we stay here again.;5
Great hotel clean close to Universal Studios you can walk there or take a shuttle although at times the shuttle can delay. Matthew and his staff are great met him at the check-in counter soon after we experienced our 1st ever earthquake of that magnitude. Overall I would recommend this hotel kids had great time at the pool as well as visiting Universal Studio Hollywood;5
Such a beautiful hotel with the nicest staff!!! Tommy, at the front door, was by far the best staff member we met! He was not only helpful, but knowledgeable about the neighborhood, where to go and what not. He was eager to lend a helping hand, very kind, and sincere!;5
"Chose this location traveling as a solo mom with a newly adult daughter, neither of us having been to NYC before. Very easy to walk from Penn Station after train in from DC, easy access to subway system and walkable areas (like Empire State Building-5 min, Central Park-25 min, FOOD!!!!). After a flight cancelation, we chose to rebook a 2nd night simply because of it feeling safe/comfortable. We did have a very different experience in our 2nd room-much louder street traffic and a squealing from the plumbing (maybe this is very common in NYC?); but to be fair, we had just spent 10 hours at the airport only to be told our flight was cancelled so I may not have been very patient with small inconveniences at this point. Ask for an upper floor if available.";5
"Nancy at the front desk was amazing. She greeted us with kindness and a great attitude. She put a smile on my face when we arrived at the hotel, even though I was still recovering from plane sickness; we all know how that goes. But overall she was a wonderful lady and great worker.";5
This was our 2nd visit to this hotel we specially choose it because of great memories from our previous visit. We were not disappointed the staff is so help and kind they do their best to remember you. Hotel is a short walk to Universal Studios and City Walk which is a super added benefit they also have a shuttle but we did not take advantage of that. Their corner rooms seem so large and have wonderful views of the city. Great place to stay we will book again on our next visit to Los Angles area.;5
Yes, this hotel is showing it's age but my room was neat, clean and perfectly adequate plus you can't beat the location.  There was a death in my family so we had to make a rush 2 day/1 night trip to NYC for the funeral.  The staff we worked with at the front desk, Graciela & Coral, were most accommodating from the very start when Graciela gained us early access to our rooms at 9:15am.  The next morning Coral printed up our boarding passes. Then check out is at noon but the funeral was at 2:00 so Graciela allowed us to check out at 1:00.  This became 1:30 for my sister & her husband when they took the wrong train back from Times Square.  We were very thankful for the kindness shown to us by both Coral & Graciela.  Thanks ladies.  It was most appreciated!;5
Hotel is nice decorated, clean and comfortable bed, good location, close to Hollywood, only 2 blocks to Metro. Lots of outside restaurants within walking distant.  Swimming pool is kind of hidden with trees, but no time to use it. Love the outside fountain with beautiful flowers, but it is at the back of Hotel. Breakfast is good too.;5
We had a bit of a bug issue in our Airbnb but we have the New Yorker hotel to thank for making the rest of our New York stay AMAZING! The staff at this hotel are phenomenal. They got us into a room later that day and were incredibly nice and helpful. We were so lucky to find this hotel on such short notice and very thankful that this hotel was so amazing. Mohammad helped us check in to our room and was very nice and made sure the room met our expectations. We also got a call from the hotel manager the day before check out asking about our stay and I had nothing but great things to say. If you are looking for a hotel that is central to all the great New York sites, this is the hotel for you. FLAT OUT AMAZING!!!!;5
"The Empire is an excellent choice for those wishing to sample the delights of New York.  Just off broadway and close to Central Park.  The hotel is very clean, the staff extremely helpful and friendly.  For those who don't know the hotel has a ""tie"" to the tv series Gossip Girl and sell themed cocktails.  The rooms are small, but apparently most hotel rooms here are! Rooftop pool is an excellent touch, and a nice place to chill after a busy day on New York's streets.";5
My wife and I stayed here for our 10 year anniversary. This was one of the most inexpensive prices that we found but was the best hotel we have stayed at in NYC! We really enjoyed our stay here due to the excellent staff, great room, and overall experience.;5
The location of the hotel provided a good base - The amenities were very good, outdoor pool area with sun loungers, sauna & gym inside hotel. Car's pull up to the main hotel entrance door to unload etc  Large private car park to rear of hotel Complimentary breakfast....Try the custom made to order omelettes. Coffee making facilities in room with fridge and microwave, large TV on wall, desk with chairs, comfy bed, plenty of room space, free wifi, shower over bath, daily maid service, AC and a electric heater is also provided in room. Well run hotel which provided a great standard of service at a fair price. Reception will book taxi's or limo's upon request and answer your LA questions.  I would recommend you hire a car or use taxi's to get around...LA is not particularly;5
Pil is the best! Very accomodating, and gaves us lots of details about tourist spots and car rentals. Hotel is very nice, cozy holiday decorations. Room was great, facing Hollywood sign. Enjoyed using the pool and gym with sauna.. Vacation was really worth it. Will book this hotel again!!;5
Excellent value and location! Close to shops, restaurants and express train. Staff aim to please, would definitely return, a hidden gem!;5
The hotel was nice, friendly atmosphere. Best feature was the early admission to Harry Potter land at Universal. We went in 1 hour bofre the park opened and got to ride a cupple of times and go to Olliveanders before the lines started. It would have been even better if breakfast was included.;5
We stayed here for our honeymoon, and it was a fantastic choice! We booked through Virgin, who noted it was our honeymoon. On arrival they congratulated us and had upgraded our room for free, they even arranged a bottle of champagne to be delivered that evening. The hotel manager introduced himself and made us feel very welcome. All the staff were extremely polite and friendly at all times.  Our room was spacious and comfortable with everything we needed for our stay, very impressive views of the city. Superb location near Central Park and very close to a Subway, with the doormen happy to call a taxi over for us.  Nothing negative to say about this hotel, would highly recommend to anyone who is visiting New York! Thanks to Gabriel and the team for making our stay so comfortable;5
The hotel is great! The room is really clean, organized and cozy. The location is superb, really close to the subway red line which connects you from downtown to the famous hollywood boulevard and for all other subway lines. The breakfast is just something so good that is worth itself the experience! Wonderful omelets and scrambled eggs =). The parking is a little expensive, but I could easily have stayed without a car there, since the location is great. But the greatest thing for me was the service. Not only when I was in the hotel were all the assistants really helpful and nice with all LA information (even printing a show ticket for me), specially Nancy, but also when I left. I Even forgot a personal object and Gisel, the assistant front desk manager, as soon as I requested,;5
Amongst all the madness going on worldwide, I have to say that this hotel has continued to give ânormalâ, friendly and outstanding customer service. Tommy one of the doormen I can honestly say made my whole trip! His attitude Was just so refreshing. Being a foreigner in NY and especially during this crisis a lot of people arenât treating you the same as during normal periods yet our time spent with Tommy felt Asif the craziness wasnât happening. He took us up to the Empire Hotelâs sign which unfortunately had been closed and was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel. He even took pictures of us which has been a huge challenge on this trip as no one fancyâs holding your phone! He showed us some other sites as seen on GG and just overall was lovely to speak with. Even;5
"My two best friends and I were visiting from Chicago and we decided we would stay at the world-known ""Chuck Bass"" hotel. To our surprise, it was so much more than that. On our first day there, we met two of the best/most friendly/most accomidating staff members. I think if i remember correctly, there names were ""Joey and Gabriel"" They were the main reason why I would come back to this hotel in the future. They showed the best customer service imaginable and made me really feel the New York welcome. I highly reccomend eating/staying/visiting the Empire Hotel...don't forget to ask for Joey and Gabriel!";5
I try to stay here every time I'm in the LA area. I love the service the staff gives as they are always smiling and go above and beyond.  Rooms are very spacious and quiet. Location is ideal for anyone visiting Universal Studios or the Hollywood area. Waze always finds ways of helping me avoid traffic so even if this property is a few miles from Hollywood, it doesn't take long to get there.  Restaurant has a very good breakfast selection and even has a Donut Bar. The fitness center is also large and has several cardio machines as well as free weights.  Love this property!;5
Great hotel, excellent location.  Beautiful lobby. Superb rooftop bar/ great views. Friendly and helpful staff. A problem in the bathroom was quickly dealt with to our satisfaction. We will stay at the Empire on our next visit to New York City.;5
We've just returned from a weeks break at the Riad Kheirredine. Firstly let me start with the hotel staff. Waffa, Valentina, Jonathan, Ishmael & Imran all of them fantastic. They are what helped make our holiday that extra bit special. Nothing is too much for the staff of the Kheirredine, they go out of there way to make sure that you are enjoying there hotel and the experience that is Marrakech. The rooms within the hotel are of a 5* standard, lovely appointed and with all the amenities you could wish for on your stay. The room decor is traditional Moroccan and the hotel its self is set within the heart of the Medina with a lovely set-up with terraces and a small pool.  When we arrived at the airport, we were met by the prearranged taxi driver (included in the cost of your;5
Stuck at LAX due to the security controls trashing 3 hours.  Missed onwards flight. Went to Hyatt Recency and Miss Megan was absolutely wonderful.  A total pleasure to deal with and could not do enough.  She deserves employee of the month and year;5
My mother and my sister stayed at the Riad Kheirredine back in April after our trip to the desert and had the most fabulous time there over the course of three days.   From the moment we stepped into the Riad to the end of our stay the staff were caring and super attentive, and always greeting us with a smile.   The rooms were spacious, comfortable and super clean and very well maintained.  Ultimate lux treatment cannot wait to return again.   A big thanks to the wonderful team at Riad Kheirradine for an unforgettable experience.   x;5
"I have stayed here 5 times over the last 4 years and am staying again in Feb so that speaks for itself. I have stayed in many similar rated/prices hotels in nyc before finding the New Yorker and none are up to the same standard. Lots to highlight; the staff have always been so friendly and accommodating to us (at check in, when asking for recommendations, etc). The location is perfect, itâs close enough to everything touristy without being right in your face. There are drug stores, fast food, bars all within stones through for when you want a quick stop.  Iâve seen people say the rooms are dated but that makes them sound run down, theyâre old school New York but with all the modern amenities and cleanliness you want. The shower/bathroom has been a little small on some stays but";5
Riad Kheirredine is wonderful. You feel welcome from the moment you step through the door.The courtyards and rooms are beautiful and tranquil. The small pools are perfect for a refreshing escape from the heat. Everyone working here is helpful, kind and efficient - they could not do more. It is truly a small oasis from the hustle and bustle of the streets of Marrakech. Our fantastic experience began via email when looking for accommodation in Morocco. Elana replied in detail, an endearing personal touch. This theme continued throughout our stay. Staff will walk you to restaurants in the evening and collect if necessary - ideal when you are new to the city of winding unnamed streets! The decoration in the hotel is tasteful. Bedrooms are extremely clean and individual. Loved the;5
Room was very nice and beds/pillows were SO comfortable. Also- pool was nice and warm. Everyone was very kind and welcoming. We called the hotel last night at 3am because we realized we left our sons tattered old blanked 4 days ago and they were extremely organized and are now shipping it to us. Highly recommend.;5
This was my second visit in the New Yorker hotel I've once again had a great experience. The hotel itself looks amazing, has wonderful views and couldn't be more accommodating. On this holiday I chose the New Yorker due to the special reason we we're visiting (birthday and engagement). The hotel, went out of their way to ensure our trip was amazing. A special shout out to the check-in and customer relationship team who went more than the extra mile to help me with my surprise.;5
You would be shocked at the modern and very California decor in the room.  Quiet and modern.  I completely forgot that I was near an airport, but really appreciated in the morning to catch my 6:30am flight;5
Thank you Damel for great costumer service. Happy New year.  We will defiantly  come back to this hotel. Itâs very cosy and service is very great. The rooms very clean and Damel  gives amazing service.;5
Just a few minutes to LAX, free bus shuttle to the hotel 24 hrs.  Room very neat and clean. Hotel staff quite helpful. For those that want easy access to the LAX airport. Small open market available at the hotel lobby 24 hrs;5
Excellent experience at the New Yorker. Check in was a breeze with Adriana. Our room was ready, so we got settled in without having to store our luggage. Our two double room was spacious and quiet. Love the decor â takes you back in time do old NYC. The location canât be beat for shopping and public transportation.;5
"Great service starts at the top.  If the people in charge not only make service a priority, but lead by example, it's going to revierberate throughout a hotel and make every aspect of your stay better because of it.  I experienced incredible service at this hotel from Tamisha, the front desk supervisor during a recent business meeting I had at this property.  I work in the entertainment and media industry, and had a specific issue I was dealing with.  Tamisha found a solution that was a difference-maker for me in this situation.  She was incredibly accomodating, smart, friendly and practical; simply put, a breath of fresh air to deal with because of her kindness, common sense and competence.  Hilton company, you have a true professional at this location.  I live in LA, and it";5
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Riad Kheirredine and would highly recommend it for beautiful rooms and excellent service.  We checked in two days earlier than planned due to a glitch at a hotel where we were staying with our tour group.  We arrived at Riad Kheirredine around 11 pm and the staff was extremely helpful and welcoming.    It is a 5-7 minute walk through narrow streets from where cars can get to.  We were met at the car drop-off point and escorted to the Riad.  For the first day or two, we were escorted to and from that point until we felt comfortable finding our own way.  There was someone available to escort us whenever needed - on our schedule.  They also assisted with taxi service to and from restaurants, the main square, or wherever.  We were provided with a;5
"I recently visited the Hotel Bar at the Empire Hotel. Although I didn't stay at the hotel, I did enjoy the hotel bar and its impeccable service. Joe Prete, the food and beverage manager was very attentive and ensured that things were running smoothly. His great attitude set the tone for the rest of the team in the lobby. The  hotel is in a great location if you're hanging out on the Upper West Side.  It's also a relaxed enviroment away from the ""bridge and tunnel"" scene at the  rooftop bar. If you're staying in the upper west side, I strongly recommend the Empire Hotel for convenience and its great Hotel Bar.";5
My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in a bunk room and couldn't recommend it highly enough.  Sure the rooms are small but well designed and clean.  Let's be honest, this is New York.  If you're sitting in your room at 8pm thinking it's a bit snug, then you need to get out more.  Literally!  The bathrooms were clean and we never had to wait for a shower.  The staff were fantastic and the free bike hire was the icing on the cake.  Only had a coffee in the cafe but it was lovely.  In summary, great location, great value and prefect for a memorable short break in NYC.;5
nice room and great atmosphere! I will stay here again and again ! The room was small but nice and suffice and will loved the ambiance. I enjoyed the location the most it was surrounded by stores and walking direction to shopping malls;5
We have just returned from our honeymoon in Marrakech and could not have asked for a better destination than this Riad. The service is exceptional, the staff are on hand whenever you need them to help you however. They booked us restaurants, gave great recommendations and even give you a phone in case you get lost! The breakfast is out of this world, and we couldnât have thought of a better way to start each day of our honeymoon than eating it on the terrace of the Riad. I could not recommend this place more highly, it is beautiful. The location is great for seeing the MÃ©dina as, once youâve been shown the way a couple of times by staff, it is only 20mins walk to the main square. This means you are close to the heart of the Marrakech experience, yet also able to enjoy peace and;5
We stayed for one night in a one bedroom suite that connects to a parlor. We had originally booked an executive doubles room but changed our mind and requested for a 2 bedroom suite. The check-in receptionist being an intern, mistook the parlor suite for a 2 bedroom but all worked out well in the end when they delivered two rollaways to us, both accommodated in the very spacious parlor.  I would strongly recommend booking the executive floor even though they have taken away the executive lounge because the rooms on the top floor are quiet and offers a great view at sunset. The parlor is an atrium and is very well lit by day.  The restaurant Cafe Sierra offers decent Chinese cuisine by Amercan standards. We ordered the Cantonese lobster as well as the beef ramen and were pleased;5
As always the Premier Inn did not disappoint. This one is in a fabulous location, near to attractions and transport.  We had a Premier Plus room which is an upgrade on the standard rooms, Iâve always been happy with the standard room which are well equipped but we thought we would try it and we were not disappointed - there are a few refinements to enjoy such as bigger rooms with a sofa and chairs to relax in, upgraded toiletries ( very nice!) and a nespresso machine. The bathrooms had bigger showers and looked updated. No Gerbera pictures either.  Check in was fine, short wait for staff and the check in machines were out of order.  Security is good with a room key required to access the lifts.   We did not eat dinner as we had plans but the menu catered for all tastes.  Despite;5
We booked this after lots of comments that Hollywood was not so safe but this place is great and we had no problems at all. So very close to subway and they give tap card ready to load at subway which is so simple. The breakfast supplied is fantastic with eggs and waffles cooked to order and great variety of food. Total surprise. There is also a bar in house so no need to go out late if worried. Staff do everything they can to help. Rooms very good with very comfortable beds. WIFI worked well. Distance from airport only consideration if you need shuttle to it in peak hours. We took 2 and half hours to get there at 6pm at night.;5
"This is an excellent hotel, staff very pleasant, great location. It had been recommended to me and I was not disappointed. Will definitely stay here again when I return to the ""The Big Apple"" great value for money.";5
I booked this hotel for the quick trip to Universal Studios for Halloween Horror Nights. I flew into Bob Hope Burbank Airport. It was about a 15min drive to the hotel. Which I took a Cab and the fare came out to be 26.00 with tip. Checkin was painless. Got my room key and was placed on the 8th floor facing the freeway. Which had no noise from the outside traffic. View was as expected for being in Southern Cal and had a partial view of the Universal Studios along with a view of Universal City Walk. Getting to the studios was maybe a 5min walk from the hotel. You do have climb up a hill and cross a pedestrian bridge to get to the park but it was very convenient. After returning from Universal, I was pleased to find out that the bed was very comfortable and very hard to get out of;5
Like so many earlier reviews our experience at the Riad was excellent. We also booked  this Riad based on tripadvisor reviews. From the moment I started email communication back in the UK to the day we left Marakesh we couldn't fault the service. It was a special Anniversary treat for four nights and all the staff at the Riad made us feel special.I usually name a two or three of the staff for dedication but it's impossible to name all the staff in my review. They were all dedicated , professional , and nothing was too much trouble. If you want a real taste of the Medina look no further. It's location is great for accessing the main tourist spots. We walked every where as the Riad provided a phone in case we got lost. Yes walking in the Medina is daunting but the staff give you;5
Great service from Pil at front desk. The hotel has a nice environment. I believe it is in a good  location, it is our first time in LA and the experience needs to be great as of this beginning it is looking great.;5
The hotel was clean despite being under construction. Staff were kind and helpful. Very convenient access to Universal Studios. Was able to walk back to the hotel for a rest during the day. I would definitely stay there again.;5
This hotel was booked as part of a package so had no choice on it. Stayed in December and was my first visit to New York. Very friendly and helpful check in staff. The room was small but had all that was needed. Powerful shower and could store all our luggage for a cruise on the way back. The doormen and security checking at the lift always had a smile.  The location is second to none and everything is in walking distances. We arrived via Penn station which was 2 minutes walk away, would stay here again.;5
I stayed at The Jane and I had a wonderful time. My girlfriend and I were impressed by the clean and hospitable atmosphere. The posh bar downstairs made it a little embarassing as on the way in as we were often identified as too casual to make it in without a room key, but it was well worth it. I don't recommend a single room for two, as the bed is smaller than a hospital cot. Besides this if you aren't spending much time in your room the size of the area isn't bad. We had a really great stay.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania for 3 nights in early May for my husband's 30th birthday before flying to Toronto. This was our first time in NYC and I was so happy that I had chosen this hotel for our first visit.   The hotel is close enough to Times Square to walk each day but still far enough away that you can have a relax if needed. We went to see two Broadway shows when in NYC and walked each night to the theatres with ease. I also felt safe walking back here at night.   Our hotel room was wonderful and we had plenty of space (we had a huge mirror). We ordered room service for breakfast one morning and this was delivered promptly to our room. The staff at the hotel left my husband a complimentary treat for his 30th birthday which was another wonderful touch.  There is a cafe at;5
As a budget hotel, this place was neat clean and very functional. The rooms were very small (hardly space to walk, but then why would you?), and clean and were cleaned daily.  The microwave is available and is down by the hallway next to where you can get drinking water from. Buses are available at 106th and the subway at 110. Buses are great to travel to Columbia University and to places beyond. And then New York is a place to walk, so enjoy long walks to Central Park, the riverside park and the morningside park...Breakfast is free for all, and is coffee, fruit and muffin. Daily. Considering that you are living on the 107th it is a great deal. . Overall, a very satisfying stay, though I am hoping that the front desk becomes more guest friendly over a period of time. For someone;5
Upon my arrival - was given an upgraded room - CHECK Very comfortable & very clean accommodations - CHECK Excellent customer service - CHECK Special shout-out to JEFF - If you have a question, he has the right answer!  Very personable & highly professional. The only downside - free wifi only available in the lobby.... Will definitely return!;5
We loved the old New York feel of this hotel.  Easy walking distance to several Zagat rated restaurants, ABC show tapings, Columbus Circle, Central Park and Lincoln Center.  Don't miss the rooftop bar for a drink, snack or just a cup of coffee.;5
My friend and I booked The Jane hotel because she had been to the Jane Ballroom on her previous visit and liked the ambience of the hotel - we were not disappointed. We stayed in room 201 (a Captainâs Cabin) with a view over the Hudson and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. The bed was amazingly comfortable and made it difficult to get up in the morning! It is right next to the highway and you can hear the club but it didnât keep us awake at all. Slept better there than at home!  The staff couldnât do enough and brought us extra blankets in the early hours, were always very courteous on reception and extremely helpful. The location is excellent with the Highline just a block away which takes you all the way to 30th street. Itâs a close walk from Greenwich Villiage and Soho.;5
Check in was really easy. Fenomenal service from mohammed at the front desk. Made sure to answer any questions we had, defintely staying here again!! Stay is also near times square which is an even bigger advantage;5
My stay at the New Yorker once again was a great experience. Professional front desk persons were very cordial and accommodating to my early arrival. Sidewalk staff were dressed appropriately and eager to assist with area directions. Screening security wore smiles will checking room keys for access to the elevators. My room was just right. Overall, I felt safe, welcomed and will make this my next place to stay when I return to Manhattan.;5
"We had a one night/two part days stay prior to joining a cruise ship.  After an eleven hour flight we were relieved to arrive at the hotel and the reception staff were excellent - very efficient and we quickly settle into our room which was spacious and had every facility we needed. There was a very 'arty' feel to the hotel with contemporary art work all around the hotel. A very pleasant surprise (as the swimming pool isn't very well signposted) was the outdoor swimming pool which in 35C heat was a very welcomed relaxing area.  It is also a good size pool - 25 metres and hardly used; probably because there are virtually no signs or promotion of the swimming pool.  An excellent bar and restaurant cater for all your needs - if somewhat expensive.";5
As a repeat customer, I enjoyed my stay here for two nights.  The King Alcove room was very spacious and had a great panoramic view of the mountains, the park and the freeway.  The room appeared to be recently renovated and the bed very comfortable.  It was quiet for the entire stay.  The continental breakfast was good, but the last time I stayed, I was able to select my own items from the buffet on a limited basis.  This time the server brought me a selection of pastries and yogurt.  I would much rather self-service.  It was almost like they did not trust you to get your own food, even if it means selecting a limited number of items from the full buffet.  The staff was professional and welcoming on every occasion.  The area surrounding the hotel is great for walking.  Expect;5
No complaints at all and the room and service were excellent. They upgraded me to a really nice suite which was awesome. The hotel lounge and bar has good food, especially the house salad with grilled chicken. Would definitely recommend if youâre staying in the Universal City area.;5
Front desk staff were extremely helpful. They had us checked in and resting in our room quickly. Room was clean. Hotel location is excellent. Off site parking is across the street and very convienent to the hotel. Cost of overnight parking was very reasonable and less than on recent trips other cities.;5
Stayed from the 15 to 17 September, very impressed with the room. Easy walking distance to universal studios. Short drive to hollywood bvd. 7.95 per access wifi was disappointing, but overall would Highly recommend.;5
Mohammed was so helpful. He was the most amazing concierge weâve ever had. I want him to be there every time. Mohammed was so awesome. I will stay here every year if he is here. I have never had so much help.;5
My wife and I spent a week in NYC in early January.  We returned to the Empire Hotel because of our previous wonderful experiences there.  Again, we had a delightfully perfect stay.  The beds are very comfortable and provide for a great night's sleep.  The fitness room had equipment of both Cardio and weights.  Location is perfect--across the street from Lincoln Center and the subway.  Walking distance to Central Park and Mid-town.   Staff was courteous and very helpful.  Rooms were a great value for their size and comfort.  Starbucks on the corner next to the hotel.  Looking forward to returning in the future.;5
Not only the vicinity of the full service Hyatt Regency LAX to LAX is a plus, The building's  parallel structure right in between the two sets of runways at LAX makes it easy to follow the flight path.  We were upgraded to 12th floor city view room (right underneath the top floor penthouse suites), watching the biggest passenger double decker plane an A380 approached and descended onto runway 24R was a very unique experience. Second to flying in one!  Next time, we will remember to request the runway view room.;5
Great Experience overall that surpassed my expectations! Every time I stay at this Hotel they always treat me with quality service and attention. Would recommend this Hotel to anyone whether you have some kind of Status with them or NOT! A;5
Excellent view of Universal Studios with best accommodation. Friendly Staff and good Breakfast. Recommend for Family just walking distance to Universal Studios Hollywood. Wish to stay again to this hotel.;5
We stayed for two night to go to Universal Studios.  Itâs a short walk to the park but the shuttles were so convenient we ended up taking them.  The front desk was a bit slow but thatâs due to staff shortages that are affecting everyone.  The check in person was very efficient, friendly and helpful.  The room was on the executive floor and was clean and spacious.   We got breakfast at the hotel both mornings and it was very good.   One night we got room service dinner and the food was tasty.  Would highly recommend this hotel if going to Universal Studios.  We drove by some of the hotels on the other side of the freeway and glad we chose the Hilton as that area didnât seem clean or safe.   Would definitely stay there again if going to Universal Studios.;5
What a wonderful place to stay! Elena welcomed us after our journey. The Riad is so calm and beautiful. The staff are all so warm and caring. Our room was spotless with fresh fruit and water at all times. Our laundry was washed daily which when you are on the road travelling this is a special thing. Breakfast is delicious with fresh sqeezed juice, pastries, bread, coffee and tea and and eggs, etc. Having a liquor license was the best so we could enjoy wine/beer after a day of exploring the Medina. They gave us a phone so if we got lost or had a question they were right there with us. If you need they will walk you where you need to go and pick you up at a special meeting point. The Riad has a gorgeous rooftop deck with a pool and lounge chairs. It is in a perfect area. Once you;5
Really liked this place. Looks fabulous and new. I can only assume that the majority of the negative reviews from a couple of years back were prior to the major renovation his hotel has received.   Room was large and clean. Loads of toiletries, towels etc. Massive TV. Outdoor Pool is pretty big and we were the only ones in it in the morning (a Sunday).   Staff very friendly and could not have been helpful. I was at the end of a long, tiring trip with some special requests and lots of stupid questions, all dealt with patiently and politely.   Breakfast was $30 per head but plentiful and I imagine quite typical a price for that close to LAX. Parking is night next door (5 second walk) and was only $15 per night as we didn't need in and out privileges. Otherwise i think it was;5
This was my 2nd visit this year... We first visited in Feb and were so impressed decided to return in November with our 14 year old boy Marrakech is not for the inexperienced traveller , but if you want to broaden your horizons and get excellent weather ,away from a beach style holiday, then don't stay anywhere else apart from this Riad.. I thought it couldn't get any better than our Feb visit but guess what ?  IT CAN ....!!!  I have been a travel agent for 35 years and have NEVER experienced such a quality hotel as this ...  Believe all those great reviews ,   So thank you again to Cinzia, Valentina ,Elena,Ali and Noah... ( and those staff who's names I never got !)  We love you all....  If you ever wish to come to Scotland then you are all welcome to stay with us ??????????;5
Very nice hotel in a lovely location.  Lots of places to walk to - good restaurants, Central Park, Planetarium, Lincoln Center across the street.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Good size room for NYC.  We had one with two double beds and still good amount of space.  Bathroom and room clean.  Sinks are shallow and i got splashed every time i used it - even after taking out the drain plug which the water was hitting. Lovely Bigelow toiletries.  Comfortable beds.  Would definitely go back here.;5
Nice location,extremely friendly at the reception, we didn't have breakfast so I am not able to say anything about food. Nice lounge bar on the roof top. Amazing comfortable bed! Just put the shower's door in the bathroom please otherwise the entire bathroom get wet! I didn't give 5 for sleep quality just because at the 2nd floor was noisy for the air condition machine.;5
We stayed 3 nights prior to Thanksgiving and had booked a double room with an optional upgrade to a double/double to allow our daughter (living in NJ) to stay with us for one night. The upgrade wasn't available but Lynn on reception was able to upgrade us to a suite with a view for not too much extra making the overall stay really good value. The hotel was busy throughout our visit but very clean throughout and ideally located for sightseeing and access to  NJ from Penn Station. There was plenty of choice for places to eat within a short walking distance, including the Tik Tok diner located in the Foyer which was reasonably priced and good quality.  Good hotel, I would thoroughly reccomend it.;5
Great Hotel, every single staff very helpful, especially front desk manager Matthew Would definitely recommend  Hotel was very clean, nice and tidy.  All was as requested and wifi is was also very good  Cheers;5
I had the privilege of visiting the Empire Hotel Lobby bar last week with a group of friends for my birthday. Our reservations ended up falling through at another location in the area and one of my friends suggested we go there. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the manager Michael, he quickly found us a place to sit for cocktail service with Vanessa who was AMAZING! It was a little crowded in there but with a little maneuvering Michael was able to accommodate.  I plan on returning very soon and will send others to the bar as well. Thank you for saving my birthday!!!;5
Amazing room with a beautiful patio that looks at the nice corridor this hotel has. Love the inside of it very much. Pil was very helpful and made my check in process run smooth. Definitely looks out for the guests;5
"Stayed here early September.  The location of this hotel is excellent, it's in walking distance to a lot of New York;s highlights , Times square, Empire State, The Highline, access to loads of subway links from right outside the building to Penn station across the street, also a whole lot of brilliant shopping opportunities from 8th Avenue all the way down to 5th.  The hotel itself is lovely , it;s quite old world which I'm a fan off, if you're looking for a cool modern recessed lighting, snazzy furniture kind of place then this is probably not for you. What it does have though is that feeling that you are in New York, it's authentic, comfortable and the staff are lovely people, all very helpful and informative .  I was a little unhappy with my room when I checked in as I was";5
The Hollywood hotel was a pleasant place to stay. The Hotel was very accommodating to my mom and her ADA dog. She was pleased at the ADA rooms which helped her with needs. Pil at the counter was amazing and will becoming back to say hi.;5
Okay, so I had read the reviews on here before I booked the hotel, and I have to admit I was dubious, but at that price, we couldn't afford to turn this hotel down.  We had a very good experience at this hotel it was very clean (and believe me, I was really looking!),  the room was spacious and had A/C, a refrigerator, TV and phone.  I'll admit  the hallways and lobby etc. don't look particularly enticing, but the room itself more than made up for that. Sharing a bathroom isn't exatly ideal, but over the 5 days I didn't have to wait once to use the bathroom. The bathrooms were also very clean and the showers were hot, powerful, really fine! The staff were really friendly, and extremely helpful (one in particular came to our rescue when our airport pickup shuttle didn't arrive).;5
Modernise heating in bedroom        Sensitive shower cream           Location  location   location  is the Hotel . Everybody very courteous and friendly towards customers.  Small bar on ground floor would be nice.  Standard wi- fi in bedroom very weak. Air vent in bedroom wanted. Other than that  everything could not be better.;5
We got an upgrade for being first time guests and we were celebrating an anniversary. Itâs in a great location in the city. Staff was very warm and helpful. The room space was great! I would recommend staying here.;5
If you are looking to be in the middle of Manhattan and not to far from Times Square this is your hotel! It's nice and clean! Great location. Excellent rooftop bar! Child and Adult friendly. Rooftop pool! Great price too!;5
We left a stuffed animal in the room and when we called to get it they said we could arrange a postal pickup for it. We did, but the date came and went and the post office didn't pick up the package. I was starting a second attempt when the staff just took the package to the post office for me which saved me a lot of trouble. Thank you Volodymyr!;5
just great, had a room at the Tower floors, excellent view, top service and just 4 minutes walk to the universal studios. (theres also a bus) we loved it. the pool is a little bit small;5
What a delightful experience!  The grounds and rooms at Riad Kheirredine are absolutely beautiful, but the staff and their incredible care and attention to detail are what make Riad Kheirredine such a special find.  We were coddled from the second we arrived to the minute we left.  The staff organized outings and tours for us, they prepared teas, coffees and fresh fruit plates at any time we wished, and they seemed genuinely happy to make our visit to Marrakech amazing.  I would go back next week if I could.;5
Small room but very comfortable.  Perfect location across from Lincoln center and subway and only three blocks from Columbus Circle and another subway.  Great concierge service.  Will definitely stay again;5
Reasonable room rates, no breakfast or restaurant inside the hotel. but 15% off diner near the hotel. Also there is tons of restaurants, deli and Starbucks near. Subway station is just around the corner. Clean room and bed. Bath tub is old but still work fine. WiFi is free but pretty slow. Canât access NYC free Wifi from most of rooms. 4 elevators are very good.  I have not use fitness gym in the hotel.;5
Riad Kherredine is absolutely amazing. From the moment we were picked up from the airport, in a very nice large, spacious 4x4 we were on our way. Met at the drop off point on the edge of the medina we were transported through a labyrinth of corridors wondering where the hell weâd chosen/booked. But I knew that this was the real feel of Morocco that Iâd been searching for. Finally, after a 10 min walk, in which our reception staff had met and taken our luggage we arrived at a small but substantial big oak door, which opened onto paradise. Wow. Just what Iâd dreamt of but more. Sparklingly clean and classy. Large open space with lots of greenery, banana plants, cacti, orange and lemon trees, unbelievably ididlic.  Warm hand towels were offered to refresh as was the best mint tea;5
My husband and I have traveled the world and stayed in many wonderful hotels but from the Riad Kheirredine starting with the first email contact inquiring about reservations to the last goodbye as we left we received the most gracious hospitality we have ever experienced anywhere.  We stayed for 7 nights and there was not a single contact with any employee that did not begin and end with a smile.  Arriving in the medina in Marrakech is a daunting experience: once you get as far as you can in a vehicle, in our case sent by the Riad to the airport to collect us, you have to negotiate a warren of narrow passages on foot with your luggage which for us was smoothly managed by the hotel staff who met us at the taxi stand with carts to carry our baggage.  Walking into the medina for;5
I love this hotel and have stayed a few times. I love the Art Deco style. The location is perfect! The subway directly outside is one of the main lines and also takes you directly to JFK for around $8 which is an absolute bargain!  Youâre a block down from Herald Square & Macyâs, just another block on is the Empire State Building. About ten min walk down to Times Square. Thereâs a little deli in the reception area selling coffees and bagels etc. Thereâs also a diner attached to the hotel which can be accessed from inside or outside the hotel. We had breakfast here one morning and it was a fab American style breakfast. The rooms are small - but then so are most in NYC! But theyâre clean comfortable and everything you need. We came for my 30th and they sent a free bottle of;5
My wife daughter and I were in Marrakech at the beginning of November for a week. It was not our first time in this enchanting city. We had the good fortune to be there in February and It was then that we had our first experience of  staying at Riad Kheirredine. Prior to our visit we had done extensive research trying to find a Riad which would be comfortable and at the same time enchant us.We wanted something magical. It was a difficult job! It was the positive reviews we read in Tripadvisor  about the Riad that made us decide to book with them and we were not disappointed, we had  the most wonderful stay. On this occasion there was no doubt in our mind and we directly booked a week with Riad Kheirredine.  When reading the different reviews on the Riad you realize that everyone;5
We found the Hotel was great, situated opposite Madison square garden, a short walk to Macy's and the Empire State Building. The Marble entrance and and chandelier makes an impressive welcome. The staff were very friendly and couldn't of been more helpful.;5
When we arrived, the lobby lovely and big.  Did not have to wait to long to check in.  We asked for an upgrade and were given two double beds on the 7th floor.  We asked if we could get three bedded room was offered this with two bathrooms for $100 each night staying for 5 nights [felt it was a lot of money] went for the one on the 7th floor.  The room was lovely, long more than wide.  No view out the window but did not mind a bit as we were at the back of the hotel and could not hear any traffic what so ever.   The beds were four ft,  Not really big enough for two to sleep comfortably so we opted to get a fold up bed at a cost of $135.   We had tea/coffee maker with pods and creme and sugar.  Two wardrobes.  Flat screen TV.  The bathroom was small enough but the shower was nice;5
Came to visit family, the hotel met all my expectations, Pil made me feel at home, he helped me get around in the metro which is only 1 block away, helped me save time and money. Highly recommend this hotel, I couldnât use the sauna but will next time I come, will visit soon.;5
Best stay at the Hollywood hotel, this is the family hotel, we always stay when in LA today Pil and Nelson were the best, always look forward to seeing a great team like them two guys, we recommended to all traveling families;5
Our stay at the Hyatt Regency LAX was just what was needed. Our flight arrived after midnight and the shuttle arrived within minutes. The transfer was safe. Our amcheckin was excellent and the comfort of the room was great.;5
The contrast between the chaotic, colourful, crazy souks and main square, and this calm, tasteful and welcoming riad couldn't be more defined.  We arrived at 9am, tired after a very early start, to find a wonderful breakfast set out for us by the pool. We found an attention to detail, a friendliness and complete back-up on the getting lost front.  The streets are very confusing, and do beware of kids wanting to guide you home and then demanding over the odds for that service, and getting quite rude when Â£10 for a 5 minute job wasn't forthcoming. The riad provided a mobile phone to ring at any time, but also guided us around and were extraordinarily helpful.  The roof terrace, with loungers - both in the sun and curtained-off - was a wonderful place to unwind after the shopping;5
Just back from New York last week and stayed in New Yorker,well we had a fantastic time,place lovely and staff very friendly especially miss Henry head of security as our safe was broke and she came next day to fix it,she also advised us things to do and .she is such a lovely person .the tick tick diner is great plenty of food choices,again staff friendly and helpful nothing a problem for them.will definitely be back and will stay there in your hotel again made plenty of memories;5
We stayed here with our two young children for a night in the city and it was great! The staff was extremely helpful and the hotel was clean and spacious! Even in the busy city it was easy to get to the front, valet the car and go. Also a simple walk to Times Square in one direction or Central Park in the other and other attractions!;5
Checked in 7/5 stayed 2 nights , nice clean safe hotel with shuttle to universal . Short drive to Hollywood Blvd for Hollywood attractions .Friendly helpful staff. Stayed on the 16th floor nice view looking north west. Quiet surroundings away from the city. Lots of dining in the hotel and city walk is a shuttle ride awayðððð;5
If you are thinking of somewhere to stay in Marrakesh then you will find it hard to get anywhere better than this. From the moment we were picked up and finally dropped back at the airport all the staff from the Riad could not have been more helpful or welcoming. Nothing seemed too much for them. The Riad itself is supurb - great rooms, cool courtyards and a fanatstic roof terrace where you can have breakfast or generally relax on at any time of the day with a backdrop of the snow covered Atlas Mountains. You are given a phone to use if you get lost anywhere in the Medina - one phone call and rescue is at hand. Tips and recommendations about where to visit and eat are well worth taking as we booked 2 excellent meals through the staff. Tea, coffee, water and fruit juices are;5
This hotel was awesome and Luis and Randall hooked us up fat with the deals and room! 10/10 would come back! It is near so many things and my fiancÃ© and I had a great time!! Thank you, The Empire. Beautiful!;5
Jerome made Check in easy and quick. He was very friendly and had such a great personality! Spring break and visited Universal Studios. First time at this location and will most definitely stay here again!;5
From the moment we arrived till the moment we checked out we were treated fantastically , staff couldnât do enough for you , room was immaculate and a great bathroom and with tons of fluffy towels . This will be our go to hotel whenever visiting New York from now on . Huge thanks to Belkis who went above and beyond for us;5
This hotel would probably be four star for amenities, still very nice, but the staff really puts it over the top. The bellmen, valets are genuinely pleasant and friendly even if just asking a question. The restaurant staff is outstanding. Juliette (hostess manager) was wonderful. Excellent waiter Rosendo. The breakfast rush can be crazy so their attitude is so welcoming. We had a problem with our original room (not their fault but not one you could stay in). They were completely booked but found us the last room snd it was handled so well.  Thank you universal Hilton!;5
The hotel is great I upgraded to a premier room and it was perfect for my stay. The staff was always helpful with any requests I had. Also, you canât beat the location and Premier Inn is great value for central London.;5
Although it's inside is a little gloomy because of the outdated rugs and curtains this hotel was in the center to everything we wanted to do in Manhattan. The concierage was helpful in getting the tickets to see the Rockettes at a decent price.;5
Five on the Hill was amazing! Everyone was great, Mayan was so sweet! It was a 10/10 overall. I would definitely recommend and come back for brunch for sure. Also bottomless Mimosas was a plus. Chefâs Kiss;5
This is an amazing Riad, absolutely beautiful.  We were completely blown away by the service and the ambiance of this Riad. The attention to detail is amazing. I can not say enough about the staff. Yes, it is a little far from the hub of the city but we thought that only enhanced it's appeal to us. However, there are a few glitches, one was in our room. We had a junior suite, it was more junior than suite and not worth the additional cost over the deluxe room. I wish I had paid better attention to the pictures on their website then I would have realized how narrow the space was and how little room there was to store anything. The seating area was a joke and two people could not be in the bathroom at the same time, luckily the common area was fantastic and we only used our room;5
Great atmosphere, don't feel like you're in LA. The staff always had time for us, or they made a superb effort to make your time with them was special & comfortable, they have elevator attendants (my only downgrade, slow elevators). Great view from our room of Universal Studios & The City Walk, very comfortable;5
This hotel was one of the best hotel I stayed at.. The staff Pil, Nicole, and Beatriz they are so helpful with everything.. Nicole was very helpful with downloading the uber.. Since I had no idea how to do it...I would highly recommend this hotel.. The breakfast was outstanding, a good way to start your morning.. The staff is outstanding and so polite.. It had a very nice pool area to relax in and get some sunshine.. Doreen Dombrowski;5
My boyfriend and I just got back from a 3 night stay here.  I checked in around noon and discovered that the room was ready!  Stewart at the front desk is the friendliest most helpful man.  Thank you for everything!  I'm ready to swap places with you anytime :) Our room was on the 21st floor overlooking Universal Studios.  Nice size room, super comfortable bed and fairly quiet.  The only issue we had was on the last night when our ventilation system started making a loud noise around midnight which was fixed within a half hour.  We were given coupons for a free continental breakfast with the option to upgrade to the buffet.  The continental breakfast was good and they gave you enough food without having to upgrade.   We did try the buffet on our last morning there which was;5
I was in the city to tour colleges with my daughter and we came in exhausted from an early flight.  Due to circumstances beyond our control there was in issue with my credit card that made checking in difficult.  Pasquiale at the front desk worked with me until the issue was resolved.  He held our room and we checked in without any additional problems.  He was courteous and professional and never made me feel uncomfortable about the cc problems.  Our 3 night stay was wonderful and Pasquiale and the entire staff at the Empire was without doubt the best service I have ever had at any hotel in NYC.  Thank you Pasquiale & Empire staff!!!  See you again soon!;5
The place was packed with conferences, but still the service was great.  Gobalist benefits included free breakfast.  We were told the restaurant opened at 5 am, but actually it opens at 6.  However, the front desk gave us vouchers for food from the grab and go, so we were able to head for our early flight with no problems.  Key to an airport hotel is the shuttle service and that was exceptional at this Hyatt.;5
I booked a last-minute stay here for a night and was very pleasantly surprised with the location, service and room.  This hotel has a lot of character, especially the downstairs bar, which is cozy and has a great cocktail menu.;5
I spend lots of nights per years in hotels traveling for business. That being said, it is tough to impress me or to even break out of the norm. The Hilton Universal City did both.   I arrived early but my room was ready. The food in the Sierra Cafe (had the chicken & sausage alfredo) was terrific and the service from the front desk, to the dining room staff, to the gentleman who just dropped off a basket of fruit in my room, has been outstanding. Very attentive and overly helpful.  After spending 100+ nights in hotels this past year (2009) this one really distinguished itself and has totally earned my loyalty.;5
Stayed here 4 nights and was pleasantly surprised. Lovely clean room and friendly and helpful staff. Breakfasts were great. Hugo and Jose were very accommodating to my 6 year old niece who wanted waffles and scrambled eggs all the time. The area is close to convenience stores and great places to eat. There is a 24 hour laundry place across the road which was handy as the hotel self-laundry services close at 10pm. We felt completely safe in this area. There is also a lovely Mexican place called Danys Deli very close to hotel which serves delicious Mexican food. There is also a Metro station very close down the road too.   The only negative (very small criticism) is the aircon could be better. The max we could turn the aircon up wasn't that strong.;5
We LOVED our stay at the New Yorker. We had insane views from the top floor and loved being able to see the Empire State Building from our room! The hotel is walkable to broadway, shopping, and Penn Station. You could literally walk of a train, check into your hotel, and be at a show within and hour. The original art deco architecture and interior is stunning.;5
Smooth check in and out. Friendliest staff! Very satisfied with our 1 bedroom suite! Sweet! Perfect view of the Empire State! Will definitely come back. Easy access to the metro/ subway. Tick Tok diner perfect for late night munch and drinks.;5
Good hotel for a quick stay in Hollywood. Most attractions about 15 miles away by underground train. Not the nicest neighborhood but hotel is a hidden gem. Came for a concert at the Greek which is recommended to arrive by Uber. Can say the room was not expected. Very nice and cozy with a Hollywood charm.   Thanks Pil and Beatriz for a beautiful reception and for all your tips during our stay.;5
What to say that everyone else has not??? From the moment we were picked up at the airport until the time we left nothing was too much for the staff. We were treated so well that I really hated to leave and the service was superb! If we are ever back in Marrakech, we will not hesitate to return to the Riad Kheirredine.;5
The most beautiful and amazing place we've ever stayed. Excellent staff, the rooms are constantly being cleaned and the terrace is spot on with the rooftop pool and amazing beds. 100% recommend to stay here. It's right in the madina madness, Close enough to everything you need.;5
Our room had the best view of the Empire State building all lit up in red and green for the holiday. We loved being on the 21st floor because the elevator went from floor 20 up so we were able to go up and down quickly. The location was wonderful. We could walk to Times Square, Broadway shows, Macy's and more. I liked the security where we had to show our room key to access the elevator banks. The hotel also let us check in early which was great. We were there to watch our son march in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade so the hotel was a great location for getting to a great spot on the parade route.;5
"Very clean, great location, just few streets to subway station, a lot of shops and restaurants around hotel, nice area:) you have great price, air condition, hot water, and clean bed- everything you need;-) I totally recommend this!:)";5
First entering the hotel we came across the bellman Siad. He was so helpful and always smiling. Really nice to see that in NYC. Our room was not ready yet, which was not a problem our bags were held and we ventured outside. Upon returning our room was ready. Our room was small but had everything we needed, a comfortable bed and most importantly very clean. The A/C worked great thankfully because it was sweltering the day we arrived. I would not hesitate to stay here again and again!;5
Our first impression of Morocco was through Riad Kheirredine and we have fallen in love with both Marrakech and this gorgeous riad.  Our driver was waiting for us at the airport and drove us down to the end f the road, where staff from the road were waiting to carry our luggage in (wheelbarrows) down the winding cobblestone streets too narrow for cars. Just as you start questioning whether youâre in the right place, you approach the road down a nondescript street and enter a doorway that reveals the most luscious lobby, all white everything with a small pool, giant plants everywhere, and large bowl of fresh fruit and Moroccan mint tea waiting for you.  As with a lot of buildings in Morocco, the layout moves upwards, and Kheirredine reaches about 5 storeys into the sky with;5
Excellent check in , small but spotless room , 1st class location ,  comfortable bed & room cleaned everyday  For me personally I would have liked coffee making facilities but it's not a deal breaker . $5 per bag to store luggage on leaving , quick & painless checkout  ðð;5
We really enjoyed staying at the Hyatt, the staff was super friendly. We had a great, fast experience checking in. The lady at the valet let us leave our car out front for 30 minutes free of charge while we checked in and dropped our bags in our room. The room was very clean & modern. And the pool was super warm which was nice because it was a cold night.;5
We had a fantastic stay at this luxurious and comfortable hotel. The staff were first rate and went out of their way to help us out. I can thoroughly recommend it.;5
Thank you to Siham, Elena, and the entire staff here at Riad Kheirredine!! My husband and I stayed here as part of our Morocco tour for our honeymoon. The staff was communicative and organized from the beginning. We had a flight change last minute and they worked with us to adjust our reservations. They offer very unique and helpful amenities such as assistance with reservations, local tips, walking guides to navigate the Medina, and a cellphone with direct access to reception during your stay. We loved the tranquility of the hotel. The decor is beautiful and the pool was refreshing for hot days. We will definitely be back for any return visits to Marrakech!;5
After reading other reviews I fear people are missing the point of this hotel. The decor in all areas from the lobby to the corridors is definitely of Art Deco influences. What others are seeing as âoutdatedâ is merely the hotels choice of decor in line with the style and age of the building. We were offered an upgraded room with Empire State Building views for $10 per night which was great. The resort fees are all discussed with your travel agent when booking and are clear to see on the website so again unsure on why people insist on making that an issue. We had a lovely stay here, felt safe, close to many of the must see sights of New York and subway station across the street.;5
Im staying at this hotel over a month now and it was probably the best accomodation. It was the staff that really made it a worthwhile place to stay especially Pil  whose been super nice. And doing a super good job!;5
Myself and my sister spent 3 wonderful action packed days in New York.  We booked this hotel because it was in a great location and was well priced for a limited budget!  We had a double room on 8th floor, nice en suite big shower which was great!  We had complimentary tea and coffee at reception each day (including very nice calomile tea!).  Also we had a water fountain in foyer to replenish supplies for room.   5 min walk to broadway, great shopping & loads of great restaurants (something for every diet and pocket!!).  So message here great location good hotel with clean linen, new towels as required!  Very welcoming staff no hidden charges.  We didn't use the mini bar (too expensive).  Great staff, reception doorman cleaning bar staff all friendly and efficient all doing;5
Great guy to check in with Gustavo hotel was nice will come again for the price you canât beat it itâs also near fast foot places perfect for the family I am here to come to universal studios and this is good spot;5
We booked two rooms with my family, and we enjoyed our stay. The location is great and is close to almost everything. We could walk to almost all the attractions. The adjacent restaurant was wonderful. The rooms are clean and reasonably spacious. The lobby is quite big for NY. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who is looking for comfort during your stay in NYC.;5
If you are planning to visit Universal Studios Hollywood the Hilton should be your first choice. It is closest to the park with free shuttle service.  However the best part is the great customer service and wonderful accommodations.  The staff are friendly and willing to assist. Julio at the bell desks was great. There were many others from the front desk to wait persons who took the time to make the stay great, but I failed to recall names.  The rooms were well appointed and clean. If you can get a corner room that offers s bit more space.;5
There is a reason this Riad is ranked at the top.  Service here is better than many 5 star resorts.  Imagine this...110 degrees outside, you walk into the Riad, instantly towels for refreshing, any type of drink, fruit, food in your hands. AC is ice cold.  This sums up how you will be treated every single time you leave your room, come back into the Riad.  This service is not by one person, this is everyone, right down to the laundry ladies.  Wouldn't look for any other place on my return trip.  Absolutely perfect.;5
We chose this hotel for a two day stay, based upon its proximity to Broadway and our planned events.  I had always seen its iconic red colore, roof-top lights (EMPIRE HOTEL),  but had never thought to try it as I generally prefer downtown.  This hotel has beauty and old world charm, but itâs been modernized to give it a more current look.  The lobby and first floor entrance are beautifully decorated.  There is a lobby bar which also serves slight food/snacks.  Our room was quite nice (junior suite).  Great views, nicely decorated and very clean.  Overall I think this is a great place to stay.  Itâs not a Hugh midtown monster hotel, but youâll find everything you need here.  I was particularly impressed with the friendliness and courtesy of their staff.  Weâll definitely return;5
My wife and I had such an amazing stay at Riad Kheirredine -- the staff at the hotel couldn't have been more welcoming or more helpful during our three days at the riad.  Everyone was incredibly friendly, from enthusiastically offering us tea and cookies at every opportunity to walking us through the Medina on our first day in town.    The Fleur d'Orange room was beautiful, and the folks at the Riad surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne and rose petals in the room, since we were on our honeymoon.  And the food was delicious -- Ismail told us he'd be disappointed if we didn't put on 4 kilos during our stay, and we tried our best.  The breakfast was unbelievable and amazingly bountiful, and dinner was one of our best meals in Morocco.  Can't recommend Riad;5
Holy Mackrel. This place rocks. I stayed here several years ago, for a trip to Universal Studios, but this time was for four nights, worked related. I seriously do not know who trained this staff, but they have had to be some of the best hospitality people around. I log about 130 nights a year on the road for work and have stayed at so many Southern California properties, but these folks are top notch. Rory, a Northern California transplant, at the front desk was one of the nicest guys around. He was busy when I went to check in and at least twice told me he would be right with me. As a Diamond member that was great.. He explained a lot to me about the hotel as I checked in. He then walked me to the elevator, called the elevator, stepped in and pushed the floor number for me?;5
We visited with our family and our expectations were surpassed. From the check in process to hotel amenities, this hotel has it ALL.  Rooms were clean and up to date with really comfy beds.  Bathroom amenities were excellent as well (Crabtree & Evelyn products).  We did not get a chance to enjoy the pool or gym as we were busy at Universal Studios during the way. Would definitely stay at this hotel during my next visit to LA.;5
This hotel was in a great location, right next to Penn subway station which takes you anywhere in NYC. I liked that security was at the entrance to the elevators that went up to the rooms for safety, checking everyoneâs room keys. I felt safe.;5
I stayed here for an attorney convention and was surprisingly pleased -  from the food to the guest services.  Very good customer service.  I would stay here again.  Overall it was a great experience and I would return. The parking situsution is not ideal bc you can't go in and out unless you pay more.  It's like $15 for 24 hrs but if you want in and out privileges it costs more.  I wish they did it so you didn't have to pay extra for in and out privileges.;5
I know it's the Hyatt, so the expectations are high, however Hyatt or not, I would have never intentionally booked a hotel that close to the airport. I slept like a baby!!! The room was great. Will be back;5
This was our second time staying at the Empire hotel. Both times we received great rates through Hotwire. It is a fantastic location near Central Park. The hotel thinks of every detail. A stay here is worth every penny. Lovely romantic hotel!;5
I had another great experience at the Empire Hotel.  The rooms were great and very spacious.  The staff was wonderful and helped us out with whatever we needed. I would recommend this hotel to all!!!!!!;5
We enjoyed our second stay at this hotel even more because we had a beautiful view of Lincoln Center from the 12th floor.  Our room was very spacious, with a sitting area, two beds and a walk-in closet. When we walked in, the front desk had offered us an upgrade free of charge. All of it is so modern--we love the style of the furniture. We like to eat at a fantastic restaurant Rosa Mexicano around the corner. It was a great night's sleep too.;5
The Riad is, beautiful, very clean and cool, delicious breakfast, fresh orange juice, mint tea... Lovely to have a pool. What makes Kheirredine outstanding for me is the staff. They were all so helpful, friendly and lovely, they really made our stay special. I would love to return. Thanks again.;5
Only hotel I stay in when in NYC. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Thank you to Christie and David, at the front desk and Jeffrey at the entrance. They are truly an asset to your organization.  Great location, rooms, lobby and complementary refreshments Looking forward to my next visit.   Regards, Michele Durst;5
We had a fantastic 3 night stay at the Ameritania .  Great location 5 mins walk to Central Park , Times Square ,5th Avenue . The hotel is spotlessly clean and the beds are really comfy. Would like to thank Jeff for our warm welcome and for looking after us and booking our return taxi to JFK .  Monkey Bar next door was great for a few drinks and Pick a bagel ( left then left again )  was superb for breakfast .  We look forward to returning .;5
"I booked this hotel in a ""run of the house"" website. The room I received was a tiny one. I didn't accept it. The staff was open and candid, which is unusual to a boutique hotel... in NYC... The hotel managed to give me another room the next day (the hotel seemed really packed). The room and cost are average for NYC. The great bonus for this hotel is location and the services around it: cafeterias, restaurants, nightlife, shops, metro, Central Park. It feels the best spot you could find in the Big Apple!";5
Very nice hotel, friendly staff. It is possible to even walk into the airport terminal (about 10 minutes walk). Room spacious, in good condition and clean. Shielded from airport noise. Check-in and out process worked well. Would recommend this hotel.;5
My family and I are locals and wanted a simple get away for the weekend.  I/we have traveled all over the US and I have been overseas.  I/we were impressed with the Hilton Universal from the moment we drove up, and all day/night with everything!  The rooms, and service at the bar, front desk, pool, restaurants, etc.  Simply amazing and great way to just relax.  You didn't have to pay top dollar either.;5
The hotel,when booking were really helpful especially cristine in reservations,once again thank you . The room was clean,tidy,cleaned daily,we were on the 7 floor,everybody was friendly,in the hotel and in tic tocs ,the breakfast was delicious . Hotel was very central for every thing,shops,bars,food,stations.;5
Iâve stayed at this hotel a few times do to itâs great pricing, location, and excellent staff.  The rooms are always clean upon arrival. It is has an easy marker for people to find being right next to the Colbert show in Times Square it also has quick access to the e train express which will get you to most places in the city easily;5
Great location as it is close to Penn Station and subway. Friendly and helpful staff, rooms are not great but you are not in New York to stay in your room. The Tick Tock diner is attached and brilliant great stay would come back;5
I have just stayed at the Astor on the Park 12th-19th of July 2006.  I consulted the bible a.k.a trip advisor before I chose a hotel in NYC. I was on a budget, so wanted something no more than 3 star, that was clean, tidy and not a total overpriced rip off.  I was so pleasantly suprised.  I stayed with my mother and she is quite fussy.   I booked online and got a twin room with 2 queen beds for $89 USD per night.  Private bathroom.  You can't argue with that.  People have moaned about the lack of room but I have stayed in London and Tokyo and NYC hotels and I know space is tight, it is just the way it goes. Space can also be tight when you are paying $250-300 USD per night too.    The Astor is located  on central park west, (park just over the road)  and it is way more;5
I can only say that Jeff the butler was a gem he went out of his ways to make us feel welcomed. He even made sure my elderly mother in law didnt get lost when she went out by herself drawing her a little map and my 2 girls loved the goodies he had for them. The hotel definitely has a great man in its files.  From an Aussie/latin mum;5
I had the best NYC stay at the New Yorker ! Historical building has some very cool architectureâ- Really a great room - plenty of space for me and my three kids. We really liked the location - minutes to Times Square and we even walked down to Chelsea market and a nearby park to run off some steam on a nice day !  I can also say that the front desk, the bell staff, the hotel lobby attendants were all very attentive and friendly. The breakfast diner was perfect for a pancake breakfast.  The housekeeping staff was also wonderful. I really canât say enough good things .  I have stayed now at almost all the big chains and a few small ones and this one was the best for me and my children .  Thanks !;5
Upon arrival the manager was very helpful with us all, the room was clean & beds were tidy. Very much âyou get what you pay forâ being just a standard room, but more than worth the low price you pay! Working TV was a bonus. Would definitely visit again.;5
Everything was as good as could be expected . The room was very clean, the service was excellent the staff were always at our service, The food was also excellent. Everything was of excellent quality. For the amenities the cost was more than reasonable.;5
Everything about the Riad Kheirredine is fabulous and weâre so glad we chose it. We wanted somewhere central to experience the real culture of Marrakech and this Hotel delivered in spades.  They really look after you here as if you are family, and nothing is too much trouble. The staff are quite exceptional â¦every single one of them â¦and thatâs what makes it special! So if youâre looking for high quality accommodation at affordable prices then look no furtherâ¦ This truly is outstanding !;5
Great from start to finish. Staff were all helpful and polite.  We were able to check in 2 hours early, fab after a long time travelling. The Hotel was clean and tidy and the location is just perfect. Within walking distance of most things. The room was a good size, warm, clean, modern bathroom and we were lucky enough to have a street view. Canât recommend this hotel enough! Thank you for a wonderful stay;5
I was so happy with our stay at The New Yorker. You canât beat the location. The staff was amazing and having the 3 dining options in the hotel is great. The diner offers just about anything youâre in the mood for. The subway is located just outside of the hotel and Madison Square Garden, Macyâs and the Empire State Building are all in walking distance, plus much more. The bellhops are happy to help with a cab and are very friendly, as well as the rest of the staff.  Our room was great and the view was fantastic. I gazed at the Empire State Building from my bed every night.  I would definitely stay here again and am so glad we booked at The New Yorker.;5
Roxanne did a great job helping with our check in. I used the Hilton app to check in and the room was on level 18. I have a special needs child who doesnât do elevators. The hotel was sold out and she had to really work hard to get us a room on a lower level. Roxanne was friendly, polite, and did a great job, I was so happy!;5
Sometimes you just get lucky. That's how we felt the moment we arrived at the Kheirredine! Itâs tucked away in a quiet residential part of the Medina which we loved because it's peaceful and quiet and away from the chaos of the medina and allowed us to relax and feel at home. I can't say enough good things about the staff! We are in hotels frequently, and I am admittedly fussy, and the service, kindness and professionalism of the staff blew us away. The property itself is gorgeous and we stayed in two different rooms. Both were lovely, and you can just tell tremendous thought and attention has gone into every detail.  I'd also like to call out the cleaning staff for being so terrific, our rooms were spotless and the people were so nice. I really just can't say enough about the;5
"Staying at the New Yorker Hotel is a New York experience.  It is not the most well know Hotel in Manhattan because of it age and history, it's because it is just plain endearing.  Every room as a view and a storey to tell.  This Wyndham is classically  clothed in the original unaltered Art Deco style.  Once you've discovered the mystique  you will return and return for more of its style.  My most current stay profoundly impressed on to me, the quality of the army of fine people that run this Hotel. This is  one of the world's most unique stops.  It starts at the front door with the livery of distinctly dressed Door-men and Bellmen that keep the doors spinning.  The Check-In desk is so efficient, your head will swim.  It's not the ""Welcome Back"" they say and mean it, It's their";5
Great little boutique hotel close to everything. A block from the train, walking distance to Hell's Kitchen eats. Make sure to check out the view from the 12th floor rooftop bar, especially at sunset.;5
This was honestly one of the most welcoming hotels I have stayed in. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were spacious. They reminded me of a studio apartment and we found it romantic (we were on our anniversary). It is a short walk or shuttle to Universal Studios. Plus, it has a delicious convenient restaurant!;5
"I rarely take the time to provide reviews; however, this hotel definitely stood out.  We arrived early in the day on a holiday, and they still made an effort to check us in even though we hadn't even asked to be checked in so early.  We have diamond status, and they upgraded us to a wonderful king room overlooking Universal.  The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the room was very sound proof.    We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but we wish we would have as we checked the water when we were checking out, and it felt like bathwater.  The pool was also located in a very nice private area.  The location is phenomenal if you are visiting Universal, it's a 10 minute walk max, and we have a 7 year old so we were walking fairly slow.  We also visited Hollywood while staying";5
Stayed here over Christmas & New Year. Fantastic hospitality and the Team couldn't have been more helpful and service minded. Facilities excellent and good location. Would highly recommend this lovely Hotel.;5
location, location, location. The best place to stay in NYC whithout breaking the bank. The hotel is literally one block from penn station which let you save money and time from and to the airport. Also everything is reasonably walking distance. The room is really small not much space but its good to rest. No elevator;5
This was my 4th stay at this hotel. The location is wonderful and the staff is amazing. Good for business or pleasure. The rooftop bar is extremely cool and busy during the weekends. Close the subway and a Citibike station accross the street.;5
This is my second stay at this well situated and well appointed hotel.   I stayed for 8 nights and business partner spent 3 nights. You know exactly what you get with the hotel and I was able this time to explore the vicinity and walk to central Park and down to Times Square.   As always the staff are always helpful and cheery and the front desk staff in particular Amanda and Luis are excellent. As your first introduction to the Hotel Amanda who checks me in is always cheery after my flight usually from London is a breath of fresh air.  The rooms I have stayed in are a cut above what you would expect in a four star hotel in New York. I have stayed in other Hotels in this grouping and I would say the Empire Hotel is the one for me!  I am returning to New York on or around the;5
Great location for shopping, theater, central park. Small but nice room overlooking broadway, very comfortable bed.  We called and Jeffrey (doorman) made arrangements for a private car to/from Laguardia that was perfect.  Thanks Jeff!!!  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful too.;5
Love to stay here! The only place I stay when I visit LA the manager Pil is amazing and has great customer service! 10/10 ð I would definitely recommend booking with them you will not be disappointed.;5
The staff went above and beyond to assist us.  I've never encountered such friendly people.  Our 4 night stay was exceptional.  One awesome detail is that the staff will accompany you to sites or restaurants etc and come collect you at end - this is really helpful when staying in the medina as you can quite easily get lost! We ate 2 evenings at the Riad and both meals were just delicious with impeccable service.  The atmosphere is very relaxing.  The rooftop terrace is gorgeous with wonderful views and it's easy to find a private spot should you choose.   Highly recommend a stay here;5
Great convenient place to stay when using LAX airport.  Jayme at check in was fantastic. The facilities are recently updated and the hotel is fantastic compared to previous ownership. Great location when using the airport.;5
Yes, I first heard of The Empire Hotel through Gossip Girl and thought it would be amazing to stay there while in NYC. I liked their facebook page, twitter page and with all of their markating and promotion booked a hotel there with a 10% discount making it affordable and pretty average price for NYC. The location is perfect, right across from Lincoln Center, next to subway stop, 2-3 blocks to Central Park and 2-3 blocks to Columbus Circle. The staff was nice and friendly (both at the reception and doorman). The room it small (like everything else in New-York) but nicely decorated and it was clean throughout our stay. Upon arriving to the room we had a small card with our name printed on it thanking us for choosing the Empire Hotel including the famous black/white NYC cookie and;5
Great hotel! Close to work at Wabc- tv. Room was clean and comfortable. I didn't get a chance to eat but it was certainly easy and made my stay great!   Next big storm I'm sure I will be back again and will get wifi figured out and hopefully stop at PJs for d inner and a beer.;5
The hotel was very welcoming and check in was quick and easy. Beware of the damage deposit (cash Â£200 or card Â£150!). Room nice and clean, bathroom cold but showers amazing. Bed comfy and rooms cleaned daily. Breakfast is amazing in the attached restaurant, we went every morning. I would budget Â£25 each. Check out is late which meant we could take our time in the morning. Charged to hold bags though which we were not expecting. We have booked again for Dec 24 so I would recommend;5
Lovely hotel in the heart of New York. Rooms were modern, clean and very comfortable. the staff were helpful and friendly. for the price we paid we got a little bit extra luxury. ideally located for all the sites and some great eating places near by. you couldnt ask for more;5
Convenient yet peaceful.  Well located in between heart of times square and union square.  Nice staff and clean comfy rooms.  I had deluxe king which I recommend.  Walkable to shows and restaurants.  No need for cabs too much unless going downtown.  Metro stop nearby.;5
We are usually more budget-minded when on vacation, but we had a lot to celebrate and wanted to maximize our stay. So glad we did. This was very convenient to everything we wanted to do. The staff was amazing, from housekeeping through concierge. A special shout out to Lissette - thank you for making our stay extra special.  Beds were very comfortable, rooms quiet and we lacked for nothing.  I loved the linens and selection of pillows along with padded headboards. The restaurant was good, and although it was priced with typical hotel prices, I felt the quality and choice of food offset the price.  My only suggestion is that there could be more towel hooks or racks, especially since this hotel is green. Also, I would have been a bit happier if housekeeping didn't take our;5
Fantastic check-n service. Daniel checked us in, friendly, polite and suggested many different tours  around L.A. He's quick and efficient. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great location, huge bright rooms and polite staff.;5
Excellent and authentic place to stay. Rooms are cosy and elegant, the terrasse is great for relaxing and dining. The building is beautyful and lovely decorated. The friendliness of the staff is outstanding.  We will definetively go again.;5
"We stayed for a weekend break in NYC and enjoyed our trip.  Location: 34th St/8th Av, across the road from Madison Square Garden and a block from Penn station (easy access for the Amtrak trains), and there is a subway station just opposite the hotel.  Fantastic location - walking distance to the Empire State Building... and if you like walking, Times Square and Broadway aren't too far away (otherwise one subway stop).  There were renovations happening, so there were a lot of scaffolding structures on the pavement leading to the hotel.  Exterior: a beautiful Art Deco style hotel, and the ""Tick Tock"" diner is right on the corner with old-style furnishings and booths.  Lobby: spectacular and grand with an enormous chandelier!  Staff: prompt check-in, parents were given an upgraded";5
We chose this hotel due to a hike we were taking starting from the Chinese Theater (really close to the hotel) but we were amazed by their service, they welcomed us before the expected time, helped us with information and directions, printed our tickets, their service is totally outstanding!! Our room was huge and excellent, we were lucky enough to be given a room with a view to the hotel's lounge area, it was so nice, we loved it;5
Great location and nice hotel.  Food was ok.  Nice big rooms, clean.  Rooms seemed a bit older than I thought they would be.  But overall great hotel and service would stay there again.  Nice fitness room and pool area. They had a gift shop which was great for snacks.;5
i stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend in August 2016, ive been a fan of gossip girl for years and this is the famous chuck bass's hotel! Many scenes were shot here and they even have a dedicated cocktail called 'The chuck bass'.  This hotel is beautiful and would be amazing for non gossip girl fans also.  absolutely perfect location and service.;5
We had a wonderful stay at The New Yorker. The location of the hotel is perfect-one block from Penn Station, making everything easy to get to. We took the train in from Newark Airport and used the subway to get around- very easy to do! We had two rooms for our stay-arrived at 10:00 am and the hotel stored our luggage. It does cost $5 per piece of luggage but thatâs much better than dragging it around! When we came back at 4:00 one of the rooms wasnât ready. Since we had dinner reservations and Broadway tickets for that night, they quickly upgraded one of our rooms to a room with two bathrooms.    The bathroom is pretty small, but that is the only downside to this hotel.  The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable!   The hotel staff was great-gave very good subway;5
Best location, friendly staff, clean and well serviced, worth the price.  Enjoyed our stay. Upstairs rooftop lounge is a great gathering place  lobby is well suited to meeting friends and service bar in room is well stocked with top shelf snacks.;5
My son and I stayed here for a few days as we visited Universal Studios theme park and other spots in the area. This hotel is a good choice based on its location and amenities. We had an alcove room (very quiet) on an upper floor that had a spectacular view of the park and mountains. Staff was very courteous and helpful. The dining options were fine, if a bit pricey and the pool came in really handy as it was quite hot during our stay in Los Angeles.;5
Love this hotel, have stayed several times. Clean and close to Fordham Univ and lincoln center and columbus circle. Love the rooftop bar and seating with a great view. The tuna tostada app is amazing. Would recommend and will stay again for sure!;5
"We stayed 3 nights.  We are 3 ladies in our 60's, celebrating a birthday & retirement.  Our first time in Hollywood.  This hotel was perfect for us.  Front desk staff was very helpful in guiding us to tours and shopping.  Discovered the ""lyft"" service and used it everywhere we went.  Excellent drivers.  Bus & shuttle is within walking distance.";5
Got upgraded to a suite due to being a diamond member. helpful staff, room was big enough, good powerful shower, daily housekeeping, great location, good security downstairs (required us to show keycards to enter hotel part of the New Yorker). Good experience overall, thanks!;5
the Wyndham New Yorker was a great hotel!  I had a conference at the Javits Center and this was a close enough to walk. Nice hotel although the room we were in was quite small.  But the staff was very accommodating and courteous.  They consistently checked our room key before we got on the elevator.  We could walk to most places we needed to go.;5
Hotel is undergoing renovations and not all areas were complete but you can tell they are working on it.. Our room was nice with an AMAZING view of the Empire State Building which puts on a light show at night with the peak constantly changing colors. We came in on a train to Penn Station and it literally was about an half a block away. Subway was right around the corner. The Tick Tock cafe was a neat 50's style diner that was attached to the hotel. Liked all the history they had on display in the basement. Staff was nice. We could walk or take a short cab ride to Time Square and Broadway. shows.;5
This hotel is comfortable, the staff were very helpful and the location is excellent.  We didn't have breakfast there, but it looked great.  The room we stayed was a little small but for the price we paid it was wonderful. Great bath too!;5
I have stayed at this property several times and the quality of service is excellent.  Keep up the trend to accommodate your guest with the highest standards in the industry.  Pay fair wages to your employees from the front desk to housekeeping they keep it balanced for the customers.;5
Came down for a show at MSG from Boston.  Service staff were awesome, walked across the blockto get to show, maybe 120 yards- fabulous. Walked up 34th st, great sites, haven't been there for almost 40 years.  Gotta love Manhattan. Best people watching area in the world!!!Don't eat at the tick tock, service good, food ok at best.  New Yorker is a classic art deco hotel from the 20's, beautiful inside and out.  Spend the timeto check out the architecture and the classic art and decor you won't regret it.Will be back a lot sooner! JM Boston;5
We got a great price on the hotel room with 2 beds for 3 nights. It was directly across from Central Park West and near a great Turkish convenience store which we frequented at least once a day. The service from the staff was friendly and helpful, as they receive many international and out-of-state travelers and were great in helping with directions.  The room was exactly what you need in a hotel room, with just enough space for some extra storage, a chair and table, two beds, and a full bath. The window view was nothing special but we did not stay in the hotel except at night.  The location was excellent, near several stations, and affording us a chance to stroll around Central Park West, which was right across the street. Also, if you are into recycling, there was a place to;5
This hotel was great!  Miriam was so wonderful, she really took care of us and made sure that we were well taken care of.;5
We came for BeautyCon, and stayed for the hilarious open mic nights at the Hollywood Hotel. The continental breakfast is an all-you-can-eat buffet and is very popular with the guests, I highly recommend it. If you want a familiar homestead and warm service on your vacation for an affordable price, look no further. Weâve found our spot for our future LA visits.;5
We had a nice stay at the New Yorker Wyndham Hotel last week.   Check in was easy, we liked that there were security guards making sure that no people who didnât belong were going up in the elevators. The room was quite large. We had two queen beds, plenty of room to move around for a married couple and our adult son. The tick-tock diner on the ground floor was great for breakfast, the Italian restaurant on the other side was great for supper. You never actually had to leave the hotel, but if you wanted to, Penn station was right around the corner. We took the train in and rolled our suitcases right off the ramp onto the sidewalk And walked for about a half a block to get into the hotel. We had to ask for a coffee maker, but it was delivered quickly.  There is a McDonaldâs right;5
From the moment we got there, we were greated with a friendly atmosphere.  The lady on reception(I forgot to get her name) was lovely,  she went out of her way to pick a fantastic room for us and even left us a welcome note with some snacks.  This was very nice.  The room was perfect.  Clean and fresh. With a fantastic view for two teenagers who have never been in a hotel before.  My son has autism and adhd.  These little extra touches made our stay much more relaxed.  I booked the breakfast with the hotel and wasn't disappointed,  food was never empty, hot water a plenty.The only change I'd make is having two options for dairy free milk.  Soya milk was the only one and would have preferred oat or almond milk. In the bedrooms only semi skimmed milk;5
The service, accommodations, and location were ideal!  We need some flexibility in scheduling and Nancy Rameriz was incredible!  Great staff - all were solution oriented and made our stay terrific. We really liked the secure parking and security system in getting to our room. Also, the coffee pot, microwave, and frig were such a nice touch!  The courtyard was wonderful and great pool too!;5
All staff personnel demostrated super service  in a highly professional manner. I will s=certainly stay here again and addition recommend this hotel to all.;5
Stayed here for three nights for our annual girls trip and it canât be beat. The location is great, close to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave, etc. Close to the subway and great small restaraunts nearby. Jeff the bellman was great. Always greeting us and answering our questions. This was the best hotel for what we were looking for. Our room wasnât ready at check-in(we got there really early), but we did a pre-checkin, they held our bags and we went to explore the city. I will definitely stay here in my next visit.;5
We had a problem with our original room, which maintenance couldnât repair, so they said they would find us another room and send the key cards up to us.  We did offer to go down and pick up the cards, but they kept telling us they were on their way...... nearly 2 hours later we got the keys!  However, all was forgiven when we reached our new room.  It was the most fabulous suite with two full baths, floor to ceiling windows overlooking Universal and the biggest TV I have ever seen.  I wished I had 50 friends with me to enjoy it to the full - it actually felt wrong to leave the hotel!  We also had a fruit plate and an apology note.  Everybody makes mistakes and it is fair to say that this hotel compensated us royally for their mistake.  Room service was good, breakfast was crazy;5
I recently celebrated my birthday at the Empire Hotel lobby lounge and I must say, the experience was wonderful.  Aaron and Pablo did an amazing job ensuring that my family, friends and I had an amazing evening from start to finish. The atmosphere was very intimate and beautiful, with plenty of seating space for my party of 15.  We began our night by enjoying delicious food and drinks at the lounge before heading upstairs to the rooftop. The entire staff at the lobby lounge was extremely friendly and attentive, which made our experience a pleasure.  I am looking forward to hosting another event there soon, and would certainly recommend it to anyone who appreciates intimate settings, delicious food/beverages, as well as exceptional service!;5
This Riad prides itself on wonderful service, thoughtful, caring staff and an attention to detail.  At each turn, they succeed remarkably.  John, Valentina, Ishmael, Wafa and everyone else made our stay an absolutely pleasure (thanks, guys!!!).  It was 5-star service at a beautiful -- indeed, affordable!! -- Riad, and we wouldn't think of staying somewhere else if ever traveling again to Marrakesh.    The terrace is romantic and plush, and after once ordering our breakfast, the staff made it a point to replicate our personal tastes and every other meal, without request.  The only negative is the location, as it's a bit off the beaten path and required some navigation to get to.    If you're looking for an authentic, hospitable experience, and aren't looking to stay at a;5
Perfect stay, for our universal studios visit. Hotel staff were extremely helpful, they were able to recommend places to eat followed by a discount voucher. Shuttle bus also available for universal studios.;5
Hotel across from Lincoln center is close to shopping, dining, public transportation and entertainment. It is an older building with small bathrooms and very small closets.  However, the room was spotless and the hotel had everything I needed.  I will stay there again.  The few problems I had were promptly addressed by housekeeping.;5
If I have an audition or a gig anywhere in Manhattan, I stay at the Jane. I travel alone, the cabin rooms are perfect for an overnight stay or two, plus, the staff treats guests like royalty! I have always been interested in the Titanic and the history of that fateful day (I was even married the anniversary date of the Titanic sinking, and, no, I didn't plan that! 24 years later and we have a wonderful marriage!). The survivors of the ship were interviewed here, which makes me even more intrigued (thinking that someone from the ship might have spent the night in the same room). I will never stay anywhere else, period.;5
You have a free shuttle from and to the airport every 5 minutes.  The rooms are modern ,clean and the mattresses are firm.  Check in and out was a breeze and the breakfast buffet is very good for $29.  You can also grab pastries , coffee , salads , wraps and snacks 24/7 at a very cute mini market inside the lobby   Our only regret is that we only stayed one night !!!!  Would absolutely Recommend this to everyone. Families included.   Ps. There's a very lively bar scene too !!!;5
Great experience! Room clean, bathroom small but cozy, modern rooms, pleasant staff, nice lobby area, complimentary water in lobby, located in area where walking distance is to all shops and staff went above and beyond!;5
Great locations to all the Lincoln Center area-I town for my daughters auditions.  Rooms were nice and bed was very comfortable.  Had an inside view room but allowed for a quiet night sleep.  Lobby bar and sitting area was great people watching;5
Having stayed at the Empire Hotel before and loved it, I knew it was the perfect location for a holiday gathering with my girlfriends.  When I searched online for the Empire Hotel, beautiful room photos with rates came up. Turns out it was a third party booking website which I did not realize. The beautiful King Suite featured was listed at an amazing price, and I called the contact on the website to confirm the details. The woman I spoke with assured me that the King Suite featured was what I had purchased for my event, even after I made it clear that I would be hosting eight ladies for a champagne toast. Conceive of my shock, despair and disappointment upon arriving with finger sandwiches and a case of bubbly in tow...to discover that the Empire Hotel had me booked in a lovely;5
The  New Yorker took us in during the blizzard when we were bumped by the ROW NYC hotel. They gave us a very reasonable rate when they could have gouged us in our stranded state. Very warm and friendly staff and the Tick Tock diner served delicious food. Would definitely stay there again!!;5
"Stayed during March 2015 and the hotel was wonderful! Loved the location and how close it was to Penn Station.  Stayed in Marriott Marquis previously and yes their rooms are much larger and it was in Times Square but for us, we like the ""neighborhood"" feel and the 1930s feel of the New Yorker.  Our room was very very clean and everything as updated.  We had a view of the Hudson River without paying for a ""View"" room.  I was hesitant myself due to some prior bad reviews, but if you are wanting something close to Penn Station, Macys, Empire, and ALL sub trains, great service, clean rooms, definitely try the New Yorker!";5
I've just spent a few minutes sitting at the Riad trying to think of anything they could do to improve this lovely little place...but I can't.  When we booked 8 weeks ago the only room available for our three night stay was their smallest - Fleur D'Orange. Normally I would prefer a large room and had intended to book one of their bigger ones but the reviews and the pictures of the Riad looked so nice we thought we would take the cosy smaller room. I'm also quite antisocial on holiday so I was hesitant when I saw the room opened off the ground floor courtyard but I need not have worried. Each morning we walked out through (almost literally) two orange trees complete with oranges and privacy never felt like an issue at all. That room was small but it was beautifully decorated and;5
Great hotel - clean and close to Universal Studios!  We easily walked to the park, even though they did offer a shuttle.  The room was clean & comfortable and the view was great!  Would definitely stay here again.;5
Hotel is situated within easy reach of all popular places to visit. Staff especially Jeff are extremely pleasant and very helpful. Hotel is very comfortable and clean  but room is on small side. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.;5
Upon arrival at the Hotel, we were able to check in at 3pm instead of the usual 4pm.  We mentioned it was our 37th anniversary and requested a higher floor overlooking the Universal Studios park.  We were given the 19th floor with an amazing view.  We were even treated to three pieces of the most decatant chocolate cake and cheesecake we have ever eaten.  All the staff were very friendly and couldn't have been more helpful.  Would definately stay again.;5
Great location for going to Universal Studios.The shuttle to the Studios ran every 10 minutes or so even though its just a short walk. After a long day of walking, it helps. Its also not far from Hollywood Blvd and other attractions. Our room (2 queens ) was very roomy and the bathroom was big too. My daughter loved the toiletries (classy brand I guess). The Sunday buffet dinner was incredible. Though not cheap ($48 adult) the variety was unbelievable and tasted great. One of the highlights of our trip. Most of the staff we encountered were friendly and good to talk to and very helpful to us in getting a problem of our own making resolved. The cold fruit flavored water near the front dest was refreshing when returning to our rooms after spending time in the outside heat. As with;5
As a travel advisor, I travel often and am discerning about hotels and resorts because I want my clients to have an enjoyable stay and receive great service. This hotel is a rare gem that checked all of the boxes - great service, accommodations, food, activities, cleanliness, amenities, and convenience to local attractions.  The concierge staff were particularly helpful and I was provided several great recommendations and would absolutely stay here again and recommend to clients. I particularly loved the friendliness and helpfulness of the hotel staff, the location and views, the food options and quality, the water bottle filling station (so awesome!), and the gift shop was the best I've seen for a hotel gift shop!;5
My girlfriend recently surprised me with a one night stay at the Empire Hotel for my 21st birthday. It was definitely a good choice! She brought along some of my friends and we had a great time. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were greeted very kindly at the front desk by a manager named Nicole. She was very welcoming. It was the first time either of us have stayed at the hotel, so Nicole was very friendly and helping explaining everything about the hotel. When we got to the room it was a beautiful suite! Not only did she upgrade us but we were welcomed by a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. There was even a card that wished me a happy birthday. Later that evening we went out to eat. We once again ran into Nicole, she suggested a restaurant for us to;5
My husband and I had the most enjoyable two day stay relaxing in your hotel and that had a lot to do with our amazing bartender, Del. The first night we were at the bar enjoying dinner, drinks and great conversation with Del. The second night we had family with us and still had great service and interaction. We really appreciate wonderful, personable service that we came across at your hotel. Thank you for a nice stay, we will stay here the next time we come to town.;5
I absolutely LOVED the Jane and will certainly be staying there next time I visit NYC. The lobby is beautiful, the employees friendly and personable, and the location! Sure the rooms are small, but I am over 6' tall and felt my bed and storage space were perfectly sufficient for my stay. I stayed solo in a room and I have no complaints whatsoever. My room had it's own tv, ac unit, fan, and tons of space to store my clothes. There were two bathrooms on my floor, so 4 showers total, meaning I never had to wait to clean up. The water pressure was great, they were clean, and even soaps and towels are provided. Cafe Gitane next to the lobby is a great relaxing spot to stop in for a coffee and some breakfast before you head out into the city. Enjoy the hotel and its surrounding area!;5
I can't say enough about the very kind Gabriel, the manager, whose smile can light the darkest places. Pasquale, at the front desk, is delightful. Jarrod, at the bar, was helpful with his suggestions. I'm staying there in December.   Wonderful doormen, too!  Bruce, from South Carolina (opera conference);5
I've stayed at the New Yorker twice in a year, first with a travel group and this month with my daughter and 14 year old granddaughter.  The price was reasonable, the location is great, within walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, shopping, restaurants, without as much of the hustle and bustle.  Being close to Penn Station is really a plus also. The subway is just so New York.  It's a good idea to study the lines and areas before you go because it can really be confusing.;5
One of my favorites for value, give the cost in NYC.  Nice to get upgraded - always a nice delight. Free internet is a real plus as other hotels in this price range don't necessarily offer this.  Good place for breakfast as well.;5
This hotel may not be the most glamorous in MidTown, however the hotel is clean and in a great location.  The staff is extremely hospitable and the bell team is on point.    Wonderful restaurants in the neighborhood.;5
My husband and I checked out of the hotel and accidentally left some of our valuable personal belongings behind.  We did not even realize our mistake until Lionel, the hotel's head of security, took the initiative and called us.  He arranged to keep our valuables safe until we could return to claim them.  It was a month before we were able to return to the hotel.  Lionel not only kept his promise to keep our property safe, our phone conversations with him and the hotel concierge put our minds at ease.  I highly recommend this hotel and their conscientious head of security, Lionel and concierge!!!  J. Dolente;5
I would recommend the Hollywood Hotel.  I came in town for a friend's wedding, which was also held here on site and stayed overnight.  The room was spacious and luxurious.  I felt very pampered.  I especially enjoyed the delicious breakfast offered complimentary the next day.  The staff were very helpful and kind, too.;5
I had a wonderful time at the Riad Kheirrdine for 4 nights during mid September. I was promptly met at the taxi drop off and lead thru the maze of the medina to the beautiful riad. It is literally an opulent oasis in the otherwise hectic medina. i arranged a dinner at the riad the first night which was wonderful, my only criticism was that it was waaaaay too much food. I was traveling alone, and there was food for probably 4 people :) The breakfasts were equally filling. Coffees were included throughout the day, a nice touch. My room was very well appointed and clean. All of the staff was attentive and really treated me like like one of their own. I felt very welcome. In fact, i even rode on Abdul's (i think it was Abdul) motorbike with him through the medina. All in all, a;5
We enjoyed our stay over the Thanksgiving Holiday!  The Hotel staff were very friendly.  The bathroom was not up to our standard.  We loved the roof top restaurant/bar.  Will love to come back again for the  roof top pool.   We wished that the pool could be open open year round!!  The DJ was a nice addition as well.;5
"We booked this hotel for a 60th Birthday surprise for my sister. The hotel is very well situated on the corner of 63rd & Broadway and very near to central park ,with some nice little restaurants and bars close to hand. ""The Smith "" restaurant & bar in particular I would recommend which is just across the street and open for breakfast.   The hotel staff where friendly and in particular Mr Zi did an excellent job in sorting out a booking problem we had on our arrival. The concierge guys where great fun and very knowledgable. The bedrooms were small but nicley appointed and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a bit of a squeeze but the shower was powerful and plenty of hot water. The only drawback really with the room was that there is no wardrobe, just a few pegs to";5
This is my hotel of choice when visiting LA for business or pleasure.  Wonderfully sited adjacent to Universal City Walk and Theme Park, means there is always something to do.  Short walk to the LA train and easy access from airport make for easy visits.  Good onsite parking, amazing food and first class staff.  Always a pleasure to stay here, cant wait to get back in January.;5
Before I begin, I would like to say the reviews on here are amazing, but nothing prepares you for just how spectacular this riad really is!  I booked for a surprise for my boyfriends 21st and he could not have been more in awe of this place. From decorating rose petals on the bed to serving him a chocolate birthday cake at dinner, everything was just spectacular!  The whole building is just beautiful, and the staff are outstanding!  My boyfriend and I are quite picky when it comes to hotels but I can honestly say I cannot fault a single thing. The staff are always there to make sure you have enough to drink, pick you up when you get lost in the winding streets of Marrakech and always welcome you with a smile.  Congratulations to all the staff because I do not believe another;5
Fast check-in, small room but clean, comfortable with individual controlled air conditioner / heater, strategic location where near to Penn Station, coffee maker available upon request, very good services.;5
This hotel is in a perfect safe location for access to Penn Station, subways or walking...the hotel is in great condition...loved the fitness center...excellent security...room decor lovely...great having easy access to the Tick Tock Diner...;5
5 mins from the artisan workshops and a 10 min meander to the main square of Fna and the owners of friendly riad will guide you til you get your bearings. Only a short cab ride to the new town (20DHR/ less than Â£3). They even give you a local mobile phone to call them in case you get lost. All rooms decorated with excellent taste, complete with air con, bottled water and a delicious fruit plate. There's a wonderful little pool and serene roof terrace to relax. When they spotted it was a birthday/holiday from the date on the passport they laid on a big bouquet of roses for the room. Attentive hosts. Would happily return.;5
We left Riad Kheirredine this morning.  It felt like leaving home.  No detail has been over looked and the service is impeccable.  Everyone is on the same page with respect to providing the best service.  The decor  aesthetics are top of the line also.  We stayed in the Vanilla Room which was fantastic.  It felt large and spacious and cool and inviting after hectic days exploring.  We highly recommend a stay.;5
We spent one night here and liked every detail. A special thanks to Valentina for her sweet service. It should be said that the pool is more decorative than useful, but who cares when everything else is so perfect.;5
We stayed in this hotel about 3 weeks ago, but we liked it so much I couldn't let January end without doing a review.  The rooms are lovely, very soundproof.  We were 10, 2 families of 4 and the grandparents.  The server in the Lobby Bar treated us like we were valuable clients, not just passing through for a couple of nights taking the grandkids to Universal Studios.  He was personable and engaging, even though he was very busy.  The hotel is in an excellent location for visiting Universal.  It was spitting rain so most of us took the shuttle up to Universal, but much to our surprise the couple that walked beat us all to the front gate.  The concierge was very helpful booking our transportation to Anaheim. There is a coffee bar for a quick breakfast before leaving for the day.;5
Had a short one-night stay while transiting from a domestic flight to an international one. I was looking for a fuss-free, comfortable stay, and Hyatt LAX delivered.  The app made the check-in process very easy and smooth. I was able to request for additional items (a kettle) and check whether my room was ready. There was a digital room key option, though I didn't get to test it as I got a physical key. Being able to schedule a check out time was great.  The room was very clean and well-ventilated, the bed was comfortable, and I had no issues with water temperature and pressure in the shower/ sink. The block out blinds did a fair job of shielding the room from sunlight. The clock in the room has an alarm function.  It was mostly quiet (air traffic noise is very faint), but the;5
"Perfect  in every way!!!  The hotel itself is wonderful. Beautifully planned and  designed, unmistakably Moroccan, but light, elegant and classic. Lots of lovely common  rooms,  little corners, sitting areas, decorated with perfect taste and comfort.; few courtyards. Roof area with pool also offers plenty of privacy, and great views. excellent.  The staff is perfect and more than that!!!!  Every request dealt with immediately, professionally, eagerly, with smile. Having highest level professional service with touch of personality is a treat. Sarah, Brahim, another Sarah- all of them looked after us so well, one could feel their attention and help is not only high professionalism, but also personal interest.  The location of the hotel was a bonus. Within Medina, but away from the";5
We bought the hotel room through Priceline.  After many Priceline stays at hotels over the years, we know to expect minimal service and a room next to the elevator.  We therefore were delighted to find ourselves in a comfortable room with an amazing view of the fountain at Lincoln Center.  The second night of our stay we had to move because our current room was part of a pre-booked block of rooms.  The manager, Vana, upgraded us to a corner suite and she made us feel like we were the most important guests in the hotel.  Super experience, super staff, super location.;5
We spent 2 nights at the Hollywood Hotel (aka Hotel of Hollywood). The front desk staff was welcoming. Room 215 was a good size considering how old the building is. There was definitely a strong cleaning solution smell but I appreciated it. It reassured me that our room was CLEAN. There were a good amount of towels. The bed was comfy, but it was a queen size.We had a view of the interior patio and could open the sliding glass door to the balcony. The water pressure was pretty darn good. When you flush the toilet it makes a funny wooshing sound for about a minute. Great to have a fridge and microwave. The AC was OK but the heater did not work in rm 215. That's ok...they provided some nice fluffy bedding. No closet but their is a decent attempt at a rack to hang your clothes and;5
I absolutely lived this hotel, the room was very clean and all the staff were so friendly. I especially liked the restaurant who do the best steak I've ever tasted! If I ever get the opportunity to go to new York again I'll be stopping here.;5
My first trip to NYC and first shared bathroom experience. The bunk cabin was small, but we were rarely there, so no problem. The location can't be equaled -what a find! The bathroom was always very clean. The front desk was the greatest team! Not enough praise to give it, you should stay there.;5
I'm not usually one to do a big celebration for NYE so when friends asked if I wanted to go to the Empire Hotel for the night I was a bit hesitant. Eventually I gave and I'm really glad I did. It was one of the best New Year's Eve nights I have had in a LONG time.  Not only is the hotel gorgeous but it was the perfect majestic setting to bring in the new year. There was no disorganized mess of people not being able to get drinks. It was an amazingly well orchestrated operation. The servers and bartenders were great and very attentive to each of the guests, the photo booth on the second level was a great idea (loved it), the music was amazing and the champagne toast at midnight was a great gesture. But the stars for the show were Aaron and Gabriel. They made it a point to ensure;5
When I travel, I search out older hotels with lots of history and/or character.  The New Yorker fits the bill on both counts.  Not many hotels can claim the history and importance of the New Yorker.  Looking around one can feel the span of history and the hundreds of important celebrities and momentous events here.  The rooms were surprisingly spacious and well appointed and the staff was tremendous.  Very reasonable and close to everything in Mid-town.;5
I stayed for 4 nights and could not believe the friendliness and great service! An absolute delight. Also very convenient location for trips to universal studios. Rooms were very good and great beds as can be expected from a Hilton . Would recommend it .;5
Great sized room, very clean bathroom, friendly staff, great internet connection, fantastic location in Meat Packing....what more do you want. It's a little old fashioned, a bit worn out in places, but that's the charm. It doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. Great little restaurant for breakfast or evening meal, at decent prices too. Nice bar area serving just about anything you want. A perfect destination for a few days in New York. We will be back for sure.;5
This was my first time ever in New York. I went to celebrate my birthday and wanted to stay close to my bus drop off location and the New Yorker was one of the hotels that popped up. I thought the location was fantastic and everything for the most part was within walking distance. The hotel history appealed to me greatly as well. My stay was beyond amazing and would very much do it again in the future.;5
Just returned home from New York and had a brilliant time, the hotel was in a great location making it easy to get to the main attractions. Our stay was made extra special by guest service agent Mohammed who went above and beyond to make our stay here special. The room was clean and and the beds were really Comfy.;5
The service at this Hotel is amazing. The employees at the front desk are very welcoming and friendly. Pil helped us out today and made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you so much looking forward to my stay.;5
This place is a little treasure! If you are searching for the perfect riad no need to go on looking. We went here for a short stay just after our marriage. The setting, the straff and the service is outstanding and very friendly. We got upgraded to room ' yasmine', beautifully decorated and with a private terrace. Breakfast is great with italian coffee, fruit sallad, your choice of eggs, cheese, bread etc. You get all the help you need in finding good restaurants, hamman or shopping.;5
This was my first time staying at Ameritania, and my stay could NOT have been better! Maura and Tiffany were both wonderful upon check-in, and recommended the best place to go for pizza in the area. (Shout out to Luigi's!) The rooms themselves were unbelievably comfy, and the beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. To top it off, Said went above and beyond in helping us with our bags and hailing a cab for us.   I'm just very impressed with the service here.;5
We were very happy we chose this hotel. Great view of the city skyline and a very nice and convenient diner. Room was comfortable and clean and staff very friendly and good at their jobs. This location was an easy walk to everything, theater district, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Museums Parks and Shopping. I will stay here from now on. I particularly enjoy older hotels with history and unique character and this hotel offers that with all of the comforts that we expect today.;5
Very nice and clean.  I've read a couple people say how small the rooms are, but they aren't that small.  We had a problem with our room getting very hot and not cooling.  After telling the front desk, it was fixed within an hour.  They were very apologetic and accommodating to the situation.  I highly recommend  this hotel.  Very short walk to central park, times square, Rockefeller center, etc.;5
This room is directly across from Universal Studios! I booked it for one night and it was well worth it! Could walk to Universal... and when we were finished at the park, we dropped our goodies at the hotel and then walked back over to the citiwalk for dinner... was a great location! Very friendly staff too!;5
Iâve been visiting every other week for several months on business and the location is spectacular, staff welcoming and accommodating, and the rooms are comfortable with great views of Lincoln Center and Broadway;5

A perfect place to stay when on vacation in Marrakech! Delicate, beautiful and clean. The staff was there for you 24/7. Wonderful food overall. One of my best experiences ever!! Walking distance to the sook and MÃ©dina as it is located in the old town.;5
Smooth check in. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast outstanding. Convenient shuttle to Universal Studios (every 15 minutes). All in all, a great hotel with outstanding service. Heated pool and spa felt great after a day of walking around the theme park. Easy access to downtown Hollywood via hwy 101.;5
My husband was called on for business on the West Coast and we, his family, from the East Coast decided to tag along to see California.  Some of his co-workers stayed at this hotel and gave it rave reviews.  The location is key -  it is right next to Universal Studios and City Walk.  They have a shuttle which transports you there - shuttle leaves every 20 minutes or so.  This was great to do with the kids while the husband was working.  City Walk offers so many great restuarants and shops.  The staff at the Hilton were beyond polite.  You could not walk by an employee without them wishing you a good day/evening.  They all were well trained and helpful.   When we arrived, we unpacked and got our room in order and went for a nice dinner.  Upon returning, we felt that the air;5
The hotel was comfortable and clean and in a great location!  The staff from the doormen to the front desk to the bartender were warm and friendly and helpful.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  All in all a great find at a great price!;5
Excellent, amazing stay, brilliant establishment, no complaints!  Staff were incredibly helpful, it was clean and tidy. In an ideal location. Suited my needs perfectly, I received everything I asked for and was promised;5
Can't beat the location for an NYC trip! Received an upgrade when we arrived early and came back at the usual check-in time. Jeff the doorman is very accommodating as is the rest of the staff. The room is cleaner than most hotels we stay in anywhere. HIGHLY recommended!!;5
Our receptionist Drisser went above and beyond to see that my son and I were completely satisfied with the room we eventually moved into.  He stood by his word to make our stay what we were expecting from the advertised choices, and went out of his way to see that the room details were conveyed to the staff there.;5
We stayed in one of the captains cabins for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon. The room was beautiful with antique furniture, peacock wallpaper and a view of the Hudson. Everything was perfectly clean and well maintained. My only criticism would be that the air con was not very powerful and we were there in the height of summer which was a bit uncomfortable but that wouldn't matter for the majority of the year. The whole look of this place is just fantastic- like being on a film set or stepping back in time - from the rooms to the bar to the staff in bell hop costumes.  Breakfast is not included but there is a lovely restaurant at the front of the hotel, Cafe Gitane, who also offer room service.;5
We were here in mid-April and stayed in a family suite - there were 3 of us. It was a good size room for NYC although the bathroom is quite small. There were two closets - you really only need one and the bathroom could have been expanded. The room was quiet and we had no problem with the elevators and there is security checking that everyone going on the elevators has a hotel key. Check-in went quickly and there is a baggage check for $5 per bag which I think most hotels in NYC charge. The hotel had the Tick Tock diner attached and that is convenient for breakfast, but get there before 9 AM otherwise there may be a line. Service is OK but they seem a bit understaffed. Location is great. We arrived at Moynihan/Penn Station on the train & it's just a 1 block walk to the hotel and;5
We recently spent 11 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel, 8th Avenue.  Absolutely brilliant stay.  I couldn't say anything negative about the hotel.  Staff were pleasant and helpful.  The room was spacious and the view from our room was the Empire State Building.  Bathroom was great and shower was excellent.  The safe was free in the cost of the room and we paid $20 to have a fridge in the hotel room which was a big bonus - especially given the recent heat wave!!  Hotel is very central - right next to Penn Station and direct access to 6 subway lines - one stop from Times Square (easily walkable). There is a diner attached to the hotel and numerous eating places which are very accessible. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel - we as a family thoroughly enjoyed our stay;5
We ve just returned from a five night stay in this hotel.On arrival the guys on the door were very helpful and friendly.The reception staff were too.We were shown to our room which was perfect Two double beds,a lovely big shower and plenty of  space for our clothes.The minibar was pricey but probably in line with prices we found elsewhere .Handy though for storing drinks we bought each day from a small pavement van round the corner,much cheaper.The safe was a bonus too.We ve been in many a city hotel with no safe.Jeff on the door was great.He told us how much he liked his job and how he enjoyed helping people and it was obvious he did .We asked him if there was any chance of a later checkout on our last day and he was only too willing to help,thanks again pal.The hotel is in an;5
Booked here to celebrate my husbands 60th - first time visit to NYC and couldn't have picked  a better location. Checked in easily, however was disappointed with room size and lack of view, then at 11pm House keeping opened our door (luckily had safety bar on) and asked why we hadn't checked out! So you may wonder why I've given it a high rating.....its how the manager dealt with my concern the following day - he apologised for intrusion and when I said I was disappointed with lack of view he said leave it with me. Put our luggage in storage (complimentary) whilst we went and explored. Upon our return he had upgraded us to a fantastic room with spectacular views from 2 windows - empire state, chryslar, new world trade centre etc - it absolutely made our stay so special and will;5
"It has been 12 months since I stayed at the Empire Hotel and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I stayed in a junior suite for over a week and the amenities were endless, the decor flawless and the bed -- so comfortable. The Empire is located in what I believe is the best spot in New York City. The view I had of the Lincoln Center was unbelievable and when Fashion Week began it was even more exciting; seeing all the celebs in the bar was even more exciting!  The staff could not have been more kind and helpful and when I had to unfortunately check-out early, they were more than understanding and couldn't have provided better assistance. I celebrated my birthday whilst at the Empire and the free drink voucher didn't go to waste so thank you Empire Hotel for the most";5
We checked in for a four night stay in a room for two with a view of the park. Somehow we ended up with the city view instead. Called down to Kevin, who is the hotel manager (what luck) and he was so pleasant and nice. I'm not sure if our booking agency made the mistake, but the Hilton fixed it and gave us a wonderful room facing Universal so we could watch the lights at night and the beautiful hills. The room was beautiful and had the best bathroom and THOSE SHEETS! We didn't want to be out of those comfortable beds! But we forced ourselves....anyway, Linda at the desk and her manager Kevin were the best hotel staff we had ever seen. We both had airline careers so thought we were somewhat of an authority on hotels.   After each long day at the park, we fell into the bar which;5
A solid four star establishment.  Yes, the rooms could be small, but you have the option to get an upgrade and go for the deluxe room with a nice sitting area and a view.  We were pleased with the service we received from all of the staff we came in contact with during our week long stay here.  Ed's Chowder House provides a good variety of food to satisfy my family's taste buds, for dinner, breakfast, and poolside snacks.  The raw oysters were sublime!  As most previous reviewers stated, the location of this hotel is its primary asset.  It took us less than five minutes from leaving our hotel room to being seated at a concert at the Lincoln Centre.  On a critical note, I think the PLUNGE pool must be stated in all advertisements.  Many of us chose this hotel because of the roof;5
I stayed here with my boyfriend& my parents. The hotel is very modern, customer service is excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean& comfortable. Reasonable size for NY and has hair dryer, iron etc equipped. The location is the only thing as it is about 20 min walk to time square, although I enjoyed this each day. Overall, excellent experience;5
This hotel is a bit older than most but it is extremely clean and the staff is wonderful.  The bellmen were terrific and everyone working there was helpful and accomodating.  Location is great.  Coffee/water in room is expensive so I would go to the corner Starbucks for those items and bring in your own water.  I could not have asked for better service than they provided, with a smile!;5
The best hotel Iâve stayed in, in New York. Everything on its doorstep ha, lovely staff so helpful, my room was clean and a brilliant view. Go see John (he should be in the moviesð you will see what I mean when you meet him a true gentleman) for your ride back to the airport he will sort everything. 5+star hotel for me and my daughter we will be back for sure â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸;5

"We stayed at the Hollywood hotel for 4 nights in April 2017 as a family of 6. We had 2 rooms- one was a family room with 2 x double beds which overlooked the parking lot and one was a double room with 1 x bed that overlooked the courtyard. Breakfast is included and there was something for everyone; omelettes and waffles made to order, cereals, pastries, sausage, meats and cheeses, fruit, coffees and juice. The staff were lovely and helpful. The wifi was excellent and the rooms were comfortable and clean. Previous reviews have commented on the area; there is a homeless community on the next street but this is a major city and to be expected. There are no real restaurants within walking distance but there are places to eat such as Denny's, Burger King, etc, a 5 minute drive away.";5
We stayed here for one night. I was the pleased with the level of service. They provided us with a phone so we could call them for directions back to the riad.   The room was clean and the breakfast was the best I had in my two week trip to Morocco.;5
Since you check-in the crew does everything to make you feel comfortable. The look is great, the food is excellent and the rooftop bar is amazing. Conveniently located is a great place to stay while in the Big Apple.;5
I needed to be in the area midweek, not to go to Universal Studios, for one night and stayed at this property. The location is perfect if you need to be in that area though. I arrived in the evening and checked in very quickly. I had a room on the 10th floor that faced Universal Studios. The room was fine with all the amenities one would expect from Hilton. I slept really well and I usually don't sleep well in hotels. I had the executive breakfast in the restaurant and the spread was really good. All of the staff at the hotel were great and I would gladly stay here again.;5
We came here for a weekend away with friends and we all wished we had booked for longer. The Service was great - they couldn't have been more helpful arranging tours, taxis and looking afters us around the Riad.  Food was very good, we had a traditional Moroccan meal, the flavours were lovely and there was so much choice. We ate until we were all full and didn't even get near to finishing it all! The breakfasts are definitely worth waking up for and set us up nicely for a day walking the Medina or lounging by the pool.  The rooms are beautiful and clean, and the rooftop pool and sun terraces are so relaxing you never want to leave.;5
Overall a great stay, but Jeff the doorman/valet was the real highlight of the trip. He was always there helping us get where we needed to go. We had a business meeting to get to ASAP and it was pouring rain and he got us into a taxi that got us there at a great price. He also got us a great deal to get to LGA on time for our flight. Thanks Jeff!;5
Well the location of this hotel is absolutely amazing. Close to the subway station, across the road from Madison Square Garden, a 10 minute walk to Empire State Building, Macyâs, Times Square, the lot!   A super hotel with friendly and helpful staff.   I would most definitely stay in this hotel when back in NYC. A quality venue at a good price.;5
So, I am guilty, I used to watch Gossip Girl and that is the only reason I booked the Empire Hotel and I was pleasantly surprised! I loved the little hotel and it did remind me of some of the scenes in the show! It was super close to central park and many other fabulous locations. I thik it was an excellent location and very reasonable in terms of pricing.;5
This is one of the best experience I had, the riad is just fantastic, the food, the staff everything was perfect.  The location is amazing, in the middle of the MÃ©dina, so well located. I knew before coming here that this place would be great but to be honest not at this level, it was all perfect!;5
Great Hotel. Clean Spacious rooms with large tvs and solid views of the city and/or LAX. Friendly staff, convenient shuttle bus. Very accommodating during a flight delay. My only recommendation would be to have the shuttle buses add a stop in that downtown area (where the in-n-out, ralphs, etc.) is located on the way to/from the airport. Would definitely recommend.;5
We stayed in a superior double room as a family of 2+2. Room was clean, plenty toiletries and beds comfy. View was really good -across to the Lincoln Centre. Good location. Check in and out was easy and all staff friendly. Showers were really good. Only negative was there was no kettle in the room but there was a Starbucks right next door. Would stay again.;5
We were at the hotel for probably 6 hours maximum due to a delayed flight one night and early one in the morning.   We checked in after midnight and headed straight to the restaurant / bar area. We were informed of what meals were fast and were served promptly. Food was great and just what we needed.   Headed upstairs for 4.5 hours sleep and then woke up to shower and head to the airport.  The room was clean, well appointed, very spacious and the bed was so comfortbale.   Check out was fast and simple and the airport transfer bus was right out front.   If you are looking for an LAX Airport hotel this is it. Will be staying again in future.;5
First time visiting NYC and this hotel is in a great location. We had an upgraded room as I had a special birthday so we had a great view from the 23rd floor. Room was adequate and for a short stay when you donât spend a lot of time in a room. All the staff were friendly. Best feature is the location. Try The Houdnstooth pub along the road and Andrews Coffee Shop for breakfast.;5
I was expecting the hotel to have a restaurant and was disappointed to find out there wasn't one. Other than that (and the glass sliding doors which lead to a shared balcony), we enjoyed our stay.  One other thing to note is that the free breakfast cannot be taken back to your room (not sure why).;5
We truly enjoyed our stay at the Universal Hilton. The location was perfect and our room was excellent. The view form our room overlooking the whole San Fernando Valley was sensational. Our car was waiting for us each of the 3 times we used it during our stay and the parking staff was great. Didn't appreciate the early check in fee (1.5 hour early) since I requested early check in and didn't receive any notification.;5
This hotel exceeded my expectations!  The rooms were beautiful and VERY spacious.  Very clean.  The staff were friendly.  Great views.  No excessive noise.  Location was an easy walk to Universal, if that is what you are there for or to City Walk for dining, if not.  Would definitely stay here again!;5
We both really enjoyed our stay.  The rooms were very modern, very clean, and so relaxing.  My daughter did not want to leave.  I think this hotel has spoiled her for future hotel stays.  I will definitely look to stay at Hyatt hotels in the future, based on this experience.  thank you!;5
I did not realize how close this was to Universal. We were able to walk in less than 10 min, but they also have a shuttle to take when you're tired at the end of the day. Room is very nice, plenty of space for a family. The only bad thing I can say is breakfast is ridiculously expensive. Overall a terrific stay.;5
Stayed for 3 nights (Should have been 4, thanks United)  Hotel was nice, clean and is in a great area with lots of shopping and things to do very close by. Had a great view from our room 32 floors up. Also used their service to get us to Newark for flight in a very nice Escalade.;5
The New Yorker hotel is in a prime location. Close to many things. Almost next door to Penn Station and Madison Sq Garden! Parking is close. 4 diff restaurants. Diner, Italian. Steak house, and coffee shop. At Butcher and Banker you can eat in a vault!;5
I was very impressed of how welcoming and precessional the staff was during our stay in December of 2022. They helped us unload the car, brought our luggage into the room, gave us directions and answered all of our questions. At the end of our day my husband invited me to go to the bar. I ordered Bloody Mary, which is my favorite alcoholic drink. To my surprise it was very, very good (its easy to screw up an easy recipe). I drank a lot of Bloody Marys before but this one got on the top of my list. The bartender, Victor, was interactibe, attentive and creative! He gave us to try his new drinks that he is working on and asked about our opinion. Some were very amazing drinks that I've never tried before others needed some more time to work on. (I'm being honest) All in all, it was;5
THE UWS place to stay!  We lived in this neighborhood for many years, so staying at the Empire is returning to our beloved home!  It rightfully boasts to afford by all amenities one could dream to have, and reasonable parking is nearby.;5
I always select the Hilton Universal City when travelling to LA and Ventura Counties.  Using Burbank Airport as the gateway, you can accomplish meetings in downtown LA as well as driving north to Ventura or even Santa Barbara County.    This Hilton is staffed with very professional people.  The rooms are always clean.  The hotel offers any amenity you can request as well as Universal City being a short walk (5 minutes) away.  I have stayed at this hotel at least four times a year for the last 5 years and have started looking forward to see many of the familiar faces.  I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a top-notch LA hotel stay.;5
"Just got back from a ""VIP tour"" at Universal Studios . If your going to go this is where you need to stay. It is walking distance to Universal Studios . We decided to go Thursday morning as this is my Birthday. The traffic was a bear to say the lest and with the freeway being expanded there is a lot of construction going on through LA. So we checked into the hotel after the long long day walking around. By the Way if you do go, do the ""VIP Tour as for ""matthew"" one of the guides. Ok for the hotle. The room was clean, the bath tub did have pealing of the resurface on the tub. (cheaper than to replace) We had dinner and breakfast which was outstanding. Hilton always makes the stay worth it. All Good.";5
I was worried about booking this hotel based on some of the reviews on here, but luckily i went with my gut instinct and the photographic evidence.  I am so glad we did. When we arrived we were a couple of hours earlier than the check in time, but no problem here i went to the hilton honours desk and Stewart (Cant forget his name same as my husbands), was outstandingly friendly and professional. He checked us in and even walked us to the elevator - what a touch.  When we opened the door to our room we were more than pleasantly surprised , we were on the 17th floor with a view overlooking the studios. The room was spacious, extremley clean and modern. There was a welcome tray of fruits and snacks as seen in other peoples photographs! My kids loved this.  The pool was great -;5
The room was smaller than anticipated but was clean! We had a nice corner unit. Location was great- it was close to Times Square and decent restaurants. Only downside was no elevator. With only 4 floors, no elevator wasn't a huge deal.;5
Very nice and friendly, great place to stay. Brian was very helpful and respectful.  He made sure we were great and took care of us well. Thank you Brian. We are grateful to have good service. And also there was Tesla chargers.;5
We were 3 nights in this hotel, august 2018. It was vey hot week in NYC (85F, 34C).  There was really powerful air conditioning in room which was nice. Bed and room was clean and good for sleep.  All service in this hotel was excellent. View from pool area and rooftop bar great.  There is lot to seea around this hotel. Central park from walking distance, also many subway stops.;5
The Hollywood Hotel is the hotel Rudolph Valentino lived in back in the day.  We had a wonderful time staying here while we were attending Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights.  This hotel has been kept up through the years, and it is close to Universal Studios.  We stayed two nights before heading back to Phoenix.  The hotel has a nice free breakfast. The  hotel has been renovated recently.  The elevators are efficient, and the parking lot is secured 24/7.  There are a variety of things to see just a short distance away.  We used lyft rather than taking our vehicle out into the traffic.;5
If you are looking for a great hotel in a great location I can highly recommend The Empire Hotel. The hotel is right next to Lincoln Center and Central Park. It is walking distance from Port Authority. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. They were clean and the beds were great. (and I am very picky ) The decor is dark and modern but I found it beautiful. There is a roof top deck with a pool and a bar. The hotel staff was very helpful and the Concierge went out of his way to help us. They offer a breakfast for an additional $10.00pp which I would skip. Starbucks is next door and a better deal. There are many nice restaurants within walking distance. Definitely worth a try on your next trip to the city.;5
After a couple days here at the hotel I must say Pil does not guide you wrong. Not in the friendliest of locations but very close to many local hot spots. Though this was mostly a business trip Pil did get us to some local hot spots and some of his favorite eateries. Must say over all pleasant stay. Staff do make your stay extra pleasant.   When back in town will definitely stay at the HH.;5
Quick stop before going on to San Diego.  Very clean hotel and good value breakfast at unity market bar.  Rooms excellent.  Only criticism is 3 dollars for a bottle of water.  Mostly cabin crew staying here.;5
Highly recommend this hotel, has an easy to use/prompt shuttle service and the rooms were large and modern with great bathroom. Would use again to break up long haul trips, especially with young kids!;5
A big THANK YOU to the amazing staff at the Hollywood Hotel!!! You guys truly, always, make me feel welcomed. You guys are the most humble and friendliest people I've met at a hotel in LA.  I once again wish to mention and call out Gisel who is always smiling and always very helpful. I am always amazed she remembers me ALLLLLLLL the time and always trioes to give me the room I most like. Management should be happy to have her as staff.   I try to advise every person I know and every person I come across to stay at the Hollywood Hotel  Every time I travel to LA I definitely stay there.  Thanks again to ALL the staff including Gisel, the entire Front Desk, Housekeeping, management and anyone else I've missed.  Room Tip: Any area is good - it is a respectable hotel there were no;5
"The location was just great. The staff was very friendly and so helpful. They were very well-informed about the city and the suburbs also. The lobby was very trendy; maybe not for kids under 10 years old. only one minor complaint is the rooms are a little small. but the shower was awesome for the amount of time we spent in the room the size didn't really matter. I recommend this hotel to everyone. Please try it out just once and you will definitely be back.";5
"I realize that people donât always reach out when something positive happens; so I want to be the exception, rather than the rule. I have stayed at this hotel MANY, MANY times over the years. Its quite a charming hotel. The rooms are nice, clean, and comfortable; I like to stay in their suites to give myself a little room! The best part about this hotel is their customer service! I have never had a bad experience there! In fact, everyone goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is a great one!  Take my recent experience with Naeda, for example:  Naeda really took the time to help me during a call I placed a week or so ago. I called to request a specific room that I like to stay in while I stay at the New Yorker. I have 2 trips out there this year; both are very special. I am";5
My wife and I recently stayed 6 nights at the Empire. The entire staff was friendly and attentive (special attention to Nick who checked us in and checked up on us for our whole stay). Recommend that anyone who wants quiet should give up the side of the hotel that faces Lincoln Center and stick to the rear with no view. Incredibly quiet and much to mine and my wife's liking. Yes, we tried both.;5
I cant say enough about the Hollywood hotel and it's  staff, they are friendly and helpful. I had the pleasure to meet Nancy at check in and she was amazing, she was friendly and caring to our situation. She truly help our stay pleasant, we plan to return to stay for vacation very soon.;5
The rooms are very nice,updated, comfortable and quiet.  Fitness area is outstanding!  The airport shuttle service is outstanding with cheery, helpful drivers.  I wouldn't eat there if you could avoid it.;5
It started out just like any other Hilton one stays at. The same decent customer service on check in and at the bar. Room was clean like always and was pretty quite. I was going to give this place a four until we went down to the pool Saturday afternoon. This is when we got to meet Roberto taking care of business. Not only was he running the pool bar/snack bar but he was also keeping the pool area clean, cleaning the tables and making sure everyone had everything they needed. He also was putting on movie night for the kids to watch Happy Feet over by the fire pit. He was not only interacting with the adults but also the kids. Everyone was a customer to him not just the adults. You donât meet many  people that really loves their job but you have no problem seeing that he does. He;5
We had a great stay in NYC.  The hotel staff was very attentive and friendly.  The room was clean (just keep in mind it is not a new building). On Thanksgiving Day our heat went out and they had it up and running again in no time.  We had a late flight out on Saturday and they held our luggage until we were ready to leave. The location was close to everything we wanted to see, shop for, and eat at.;5
I stay at the Empire Hotel regularly when I am in New York City. I like the boutique size and close location to Central Park, Midtown and the Subway. The rooms are not expansive, but beautiful and quiet. The hotel has a very popular top floor bar and club with excellent views of the cities.  In addition, the hotel has a lively lobby bar with regular DJ's.  The Empire is part of the Morgan boutique luxury hotel group.  Located across the the street from Lincoln Center and two blocks from Central Park, the hotel has a small intimate feel, great service, excellent rooms, and a fantastic location.  I highly recommend the Empire Hotel, and that is why is one my favorites in NYC.  If the Empire is full, try the Hudson (near by) or the Royalton (44 44th Ave). All are part of the Morgan;5
I picked this hotel because of location and price. It is not a luxury hotel, but it was clean and surprisingly quiet.  definitely stay here again when I return to NYC.  I was upgraded to a room with an amazing view on the 35th floor.;5
We went to New York with our four kids to watch our daughter perform at Carnegie Hall. We stayed at the Ameritania for four nights and it is a wonderful small hotel close to everything we wanted to do. The conciergeâs were insightful and extremely helpful. The hotel was very reasonably priced and clean. Though the rooms were small but perfect for us.;5
Just a quick thank you to all the staff at the Hollywood Hotel and especially Gisel who was so helpful in arranging our travel to our next place of stay- this is with us having changed our minds about a million times.   We will definitely be recommending the Hollywood Hotel, staff were helpful and friendly, the room was clean and perfect for our needs and the breakfast was delicious. Excellent value for money.;5
Me and my partner stayed at the Universal Hilton for 3 nights while vacationing in LA and attending Universal theme park. The hotel was luxurious, the room was pretty and a great home base, the pool and jacuzzi we're wonderful and the staff was great. Our fave was the bartender Ezra, he'll do you right! Highly recommended if you are doing Universal.;5
Great location, extremely considerate doormen and reservation staff. If you want to use the pool check and double check before making reservation. Two blocks from Central Park, across from Lincoln Center, great breakfast right in hotel and half a block from discount event ticket sale.;5
This hotel is beautiful, all staff were so friendly and helpful. We had an executive room, really nice view. Cafe Sierra and Peers coffee had awesome food and coffee. It was so easy to walk to Universal and the Citywalk. Very happy we stayed here, my daughter and I had a great time!;5
I don't usually write hotel reviews, but I was so impressed by this hotel, that I had to do them the favor of writing a review. I was in awe at how the management has somehow managed to achieve the level of customer service that they have. I have never been to a hotel that had such a consistently noticeable level of courtesy. EVERY employee of this hotel that I encountered, including the bellhop, the front desk people, the housekeepers, and even the parking garage attendant had exceptional customer service skills. They must spend an incredible amount of energy educating their staff on how to interact with customers. On top of that, the bedding was very comfortable, the view was beautiful, and they had a very convenient shuttle to Universal Studios. We will definitely use this;5
This hotel is simply beautiful! Rooms are spacious, sooooo quiet! Great staff! Good food in a relaxing atmosphere. As it is so close to LAX, it is an excellent choice to overnight prior to a morning flight.;5
When visiting New York we find the New Yorker well located, especially with a 5 minute walk to Penn Station. Red Caps will actually bring your luggage to the hotel and hotel staff will take luggage to Lenn Station.  The rooms are fairly priced, modernized and have 5 star views of ESB and beyond  The 24 hour Tick Tock Restaurant and the Trattoria both provide outstand food and service at a fair price. Year after year the same staff is there.;5
Great location, service, style, and price.  Close to everything (walked to many NY sites and landmarks and Broadway), old NY charm, and close to Penn Station.  Would definitely stay here again.  Gave AAA member discount.;5
The Hilton Universal delivered a wonderful experience. Every staff member was extremely polite and helpful. Easy access to the park. Easy access to public transportation to get to Hollywood. Very CLEAN.;5
Great service, great location, comfortable rooms. The restaurant is intimate and private, and the food is all great. I've tasted everything on the menu. I love it all. The pool is usually empty, but it's big and heated with lots of place to get some LA sun.;5
My fiancÃ© and I had a great stay at the ameritania! We stayed for 5 nights and couldn't fault one thing about this hotel. We stayed in a standard queen room which was lovely, the decor is modern with a authentic feel to it. Rainfall Shower was amazing after a long day out! The staff were lovely and very helpful, shoutout to Jeff who was the loveliest! Wifi was good down in the lobby. For wifi in the room u have to pay however if you're on holiday why do you want to be sat on your phone/laptop in the room, you should be out exploring the city!! The location of the hotel was perfect, Central Park is a 5min walk, Times Square is 2mins away. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops & bars nearby! Would definitely recommend this hotel to family & friends!;5
From making the reservations to checking out this was a great stay.  Our family traveled to Los Angeles for a Christmas trip to Universal Studios and Disneyland-- our first stay was at this Hilton.  The staff is so well suited to family travelers and made check in and check out so simple.  Our first night we went to the bar for happy hour and the server was excellent-- we ended up ordering almost everything on the Happy Hour menu and never needed to go out for dinner.  The bar was pretty empty and the little ones had a great time coloring and gnoshing on tacos and ribs and mac & cheese.    The next day we had a great breakfast in the bistro-- our server was so accommodating of our table of 8 with varying needs of substitutions!   We stored our luggage with the conceirge, checked;5
Had an amazing stay Jeff was very helpful. He helped with our bags and provided all the information we needed to know about our stay. Even willing to help us coordinate transportation. Will return again.;5
This was my second stay at the Empire Hotel, and I will definitely be back.  The room was a very nice size for a NYC hotel room.  The ample window coverings made the room completely dark regardless of the time of day.  The shower was amazing as well.  I received a quick response from the manager for the only small issue I had.;5
I Have been in the hotel two months ago. the staff was very nice and friendly, the room was clean and nice. the best location in NYC, near to the subway and all the good places to visit you have my recommendation;5
One of my best hotel experience ever, just to mention few: - Friendly, professional, and very helpful staff.  - Excellent room service. - Very clean and well designed bathroom/shower. - Large rooms. - Double insulated windows makes the rooms very quite and relaxing. - Prompt response by the hotel staff and engineer to fix a technical issue. Thanks to all of you.;5
As a NYC local, Iâm hard to impress. Ameritania was a surprisingly fantastic stay amongst a slew of other hotels along Broadway. Our bag service member, Jeff, was phenomenal as well as the bartender at Twist, Javier, (who made us a special cocktail). We are staying a second night just because the stay was so pleasant and our beds were so comfortable.;5
This was my third stay at the Empire Hotel, and I was welcomed with a room upgrade and an early check-in. I was there for one night and found the rate to be very reasonable for New York. This has been the case on each of my previous stays. My room was spacious,  beautifully furnished, and well-supplied with amenities. Breakfast the next morning was  delicious, with excellent service. The front desk staff did everything possible to make sure that I had a great experience, and they definitely succeeded. I would not think of staying anywhere else on my next trip to New York!;5
Stay here every February for the Ballet. Perfect location for a long weekend of ballet and Broadway shows. Can walk to all venues and to Tavern on the Green, etc. Front desk is always so helpful and polite. Even housekeeping says âhelloâ with a smile when passing in the hallway. Will be back again next year!!;5
The front desk agent smiled at me while I was still on line. I felt acknowledged and welcomed. The service was warm and inviting. The building and rooms have this simplistic charm. My secret place. Thank you Varun Malik for the recommendation. See you again soon.;5
I can not say enough great things about this hotel and their staff they are truly remarkable. The rooms are clean and the bed are extremely comfortable.;5
Danny Salmo is an exceptional front desk receptionist at this location. He is professional, courteous and attentive to my needs. Each time I approached Danny, he was always friendly and would attend immediately to my needs and concerns. He genuinely knows the true meaning of customer service.;5
Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and had a very enjoyable stay. Great hospitality, amazing location and the rooms are beautiful, price was reasonable. We loved our room and the friendly staff. The lobby is excellent too, very clean and easy parking. The BREAKFAST! Great food and absolutely best SERVICE!, Sonia was our waitress, extremely professional and sincerely kind. we will be back next trip to California and I would highly recommend staying at the Hollywood Hotel!;5
Having stayed at hotels across the city, I was excited to spend a night at the Empire, which is located next to one of the best places on Earth -- The Met Opera.  My sister, mother, and I were not disappointed!  Courtney at the desk was accommodating to my specific needs for a room (nowhere near the rooftop bar, view of Lincoln Center). While at reception, we watched as a group of four people got increasingly irritated with the desk staff over a room reservation, which apparently had not been reserved correctly by the guests. I was impressed (and somewhat relieved) that the staffers diffused the situation by inviting them elsewhere to sit down and talk. The staff remained professional throughout.  The hotel is a little pricey if you can't find a deal, but with the view, easy;5
This hotel is everything you expect from a Hilton.   The rooms are big and clean, the staff are helpful and friendly. And the location is excellent. There is a shuttle bus that runs to City Walk at Universal (which is where the theme park is and then a strip where there are tons of bars, restaurants, cinema etc) very frequently which is complimentary.  If you want to do the usual tourist things then a car is not needed if you are staying here as you can use the bus to Universal or the subway station is a short walk away (up and down a very steep hill though!) on which the walk of fame is just one stop away.;5
Just spent 5 nights there to visit NYC. This hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to a subway station. There is a duane reed at the ground level. Staff was sooo lovely and friendly. Checked in with Graciela who could not have been nicer. We are so grateful to have a must stay place to go whenever we visit NYC !! Thank you !!;5
Really nice staff!! Pil the receptionist was really helpful and nice. Great place to stay at, pool was really nice. The room was very big and fit the whole family. Loved the experience throughout my stay and would return with no problem ð;5
I had planned for a 3 night stay in NYC. Booked online and got a great rate. Although it's a bit uptown, the express train subway stop is right around the corner and only about 10 minutes to Time's Square and central Manhattan. The staff was friendly and accommodating when I decided to extend my stay. I would recommend to friends.;5
Stayed there for 3 nights and had a great time. The door men Denis and Tommy where of great help with direction and cabs for me and my kids. And a special thanks for Denis for giving my little one the EMIPRE teddy bear he doesn't put it down.;5
This is the third year we have stayed at the New Yorker and I wouldnât stay anywhere else when visiting NYC. The views are breathtaking, the rooms are clean and spacious, the staff is friendly and professional. I always recommend this hotel for travelers!;5
Our goal is to visit this spectacular place and with the incredible service oriented helpful staff at this hotel one day in the future. We planned a trip spring of 2020 which was canceled due to the pandemic. They refunded our deposit in full when travel was halted by COVID 19, this was an amazing & surprising gesture considering the impact on hotels. We can only imagine they will exceed our expectations once we are all fortunate to travel globally once again.  We wish them the very best and look forward to visiting when it is safe to travel and borders open.;5
Great hotel, great location for Universal Studios, great staff! I would like to particularly draw attention to Mary Ann who worked reception on Thanksgiving. We had booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and I had spoken to reservations to request connecting rooms. We have 3 kids between 5 years and 9 years, so this is important as otherwise my wife and I have to split up. Also it was her birthday while we were staying so it was nice not to split up the family.  Anyway, when we arrived it wasn't listed as requested adjoining and the hotel was very full. Mary Ann worked tirelessly to find us connecting rooms. She was wonderful.   Parking also very good and not to expensive.  Overall fantastic stay. Thank you!;5
Arranged a five night night stay in morocco via Valentina at Riad kherradine, we started off with two nights here, visited the Atlas Mountains and then returned for the last night. Truly amazing, beautiful Riad, we stayed in the Eucaliptus suite, very large four poster brass bed with a single bed for our daughter, stunning room. On arrival after an early morning flight, met from taxi by staff and taken to Riad and then given breakfast. We also had per booked an evening meal for the first night and enjoyed a four course meal. All drinks apart from alcohol and coca cola complimentary. the staff are fantastic, always seem happy and willing to help in any way. Ishmael walked with us to the main square showing us the clues to find our way home and gave us advice about purchases and;5
Wonderful hotel in a great location! I will definitely be back!       The hotel staff was very helpful. The view from my room was spectacular. The bathroom was small but that is to be expected in manhattan. I loved the elegant decor throughout the entire hotel. The rooftop view was awesome!;5
My experience at the Universal Hilton was exceptional, starting from the warm welcome I received at my arrival (thanks Diana!) to my checkout.  The room was immaculately clean and very comfortable.  I had a great view of Universal Studios and the close proximity (walking distance only 5 minutes) was perfect!!!  The staff, even at the Gift Shop and the Peetâs Coffee shop onsite, was very friendly & helpful.  Check-in/check-out was a breeze!  I highly recommend this hotel! GREAT EXPERIENCE!!;5
Walking through the door to this riad is like entering a secret garden! It is absolutely stunning. There are endless spots to relax with a book- on the roof, by the fire, etc. Even more impressive were the staff- they went absolutely above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and cared for during our stay. From fresh fruit and biscuits in the room to a complementary local cell phone and unlimited bottle water, they have literally thought of everything. We felt pampered for sure! Elena was particularly helpful in arranging COVID test pre-departure, arranging a medina tour, and providing general guidance throughout our stay. Every staff member was incredibly hospitable and hard working. I donât know when they sleep! The breakfast was definitely the best of all the riads we;5
My company has an annual summit and over the years we've tried several different hotels to host the conference and as a place to stay for our out of town employees. The Hilton Universal City is the hands down best I've worked with. Everything from the contracting to the food service was great. Our employees had only good things to say about the rooms and the service they received throughout. Having the conference near Universal Studios was also a great perk as folks could easily get there at the end of the day to unwind.;5
Had family coming in for the holidays and the hollywood hotel is the most helpful and welcoming hotel. All the staff is amazing, the room was the size we needed, will return and recomend to all my family;5
Nicole was very awesome and got us into our room early after travelling for over 24 hours. Bang for buck accommodation as part of our travel package was excellent value. Proximity to everything we wanted to see was great. Free breakfast is great and one less thing to worry about when travelling.;5
Hotels location was fab we flew in Newark and took train to Penn station and just walked across road to hotel, so handy .  Checked in before time no problem  and I did like the security you had to pass thro to get to lifts  .  We felt safer this way . Had no problem with room  we didn't come to NYC to spent a lot of time in room . Cleaned every day  our room was v quiet  we weren't to the front which helped ..   Would defiantly come back to this hotel  as it 7 min walk to time sq. and 2 min walk to Macy's  30 seconds to Penn station and 5 mins to Empire State  . Subway at door take you to 9/11 .  What more could you want .;5
Yes, it is expensive but with it. The rooms are so nice. Great beds and very clean. They have a subtle that takes you to universal studios. That makes it worth it!!!!! The restaurant was expensive but very good. Next time I think we will grab something at city walk.;5
lovely hotel, the price was very reasonable. location was excellent for MSG and Penn Station but also within easy walking distance to sites. The Tick Tock Diner was excellent!! fell asleep with a clear view of the Empire State Building.;5
I would really love to say when i stayed here in December last year from the 9th to 11th Dec 15 that this was one of the most best and really helpful places ive ever stayed anywhere in the world me and my friend was ment to stay here and when we arrived to check in we found out that our reservation wasnt there so therefore us not having anyware to stay we spoke to manager on shift that night 9th Dec 15 his name was Dell And we also spoke to another manager after Dell had left but im unsure of his name anyway Dell was the most biggest help and most nice gent ive met in a very long time he did everything in his power and more to help me and my pal out he put us up in a spare room he found (which was really hard as it was fully booked with the Xmas period) the room.was just so;5
Great service, beautiful room. They even sent a birthday card and cupcake to my daughter. Very nice touch. The view from our room was a brick wall and not very pleasurable but that is the only complaint that I have;5
I had the pleasure of staying at the Empire Hotel in July. The hotel staff is proffesional & friendly, the junior suite was spacious & confortable. The location is ideal. Highly recomend this property for work or play!;5
I could not recommend this Riad enough - it was amazing. We were in the Canella room, which was beautiful and had everything you could need. The staff were the most helpful I have come across and did everything they could to make sure our stay was perfect.;5
I have to say that I was hesitant by all the bad reviews but I am so glad we stayed here (May 20-23). The price per night is very good if you want to stay at a budget hotel and spend your money on other things. Why would you want to spend so much on a hotel room that you will not be in during the day? One thing to consider is that it is far away from the tourist traps, so invest in an unlimited metrocard and you will be just fine :) My husband and I got there an hour early before check in, but the desk clerk checked us in without any problems. We stayed in room 610. The elevator was small but not too small. Yes, it was a bit slow, but it got us to and from the room in less than a minute.  The room was perfect. A queen sized bed with fluffy pillows and a fluffy comforter and an;5
We have stayed at this hotel twice and had a very positive experience both times.  The rate for the hotel is almost always lower than at other hotels and the service has always been top notch. The rooms are larger than your standard NYC hotel rooms and are very clean.  The location between Times Square and Central Park means that you have access to everything you would ever want. The only possible reason for the lower rate must be that the hotel doesn't really have many rooms with a view of the NYC skyline, but if this doesn't bother you, you won't be disappointed.;5
My wife and I stayed two nights a week ago at the Riad Kheirredine.   It was simply an outstanding, excellent experience.   Simply, wish we had stayed longer.     We arrived from Casablanca and was met by the driver with a sign of the Riad.   Driven a short drive of about 10-15min to a main square where they drop you off.  We were met by Ali (I believe) and your bags are put into a cart and off they go.   You just follow along the narrow alleys to the Riad.  A nice short stroll.     On arrival we did our check in while seated.   We had cold towels, and lovely mint tea.   Our hostess on arrival and orientation was Elena.  She was out going and just made you feel totally relaxed and glad to have arrived.  The Riad provides a mobile phone.   It's programmed with three numbers all;5
The front desk clerks were very courteous and accommodating after we asked for a change in rooms which was no problem.  We were on the 8th floor and had a very nice view as we could see Universal Studios from our window.  The room was very clean, comfortable, and the bedding was awesome!  After we returned back to the hotel late at night, the security guard made sure we were ok as he was making rounds.  Overall, the staff was friendly and our 2 night stay was pretty good.  The hotel seemed busy at all times, but that was okay.  Once we checked out of the hotel and checked into our next hotel a several miles away, we concluded we really missed the Hilton at Hollywood/Universal.;5
Amazing staff and location. Lobby and main entrance currently under renovation, but it did not interrupt our stay at all. Our junior suite was clean and roomy! Jeff was super kind and helpful during our departure. Looking forward to staying here again.;5
I've spent a beautiful time here. The staff is helpful and the room is very large with a comfortable bed. There's a sofa in the room and you can choose the room you want. You can walk easily to Universal Studios. I will come back again.;5
"This is truly the perfect hotel for a Universal Studios vacation.  My family, with 9-yr old and wife, extended an LA-area business trip/vacation to go to Universal, and chose the Hilton.  The convenience (a short walk or shuttle to Universal and City Walk) could not be beat...closest hotel to the park.  But the hotel itself is a pleasure in itself.  We were upgraded to a high floor overlooking Universal.  The pictures you can get of Hogwarts Castle at various times are incredible.  Staff was always pleasant and accommodating .  Room service was prompt, a nice treat as most hotels seem to take way to long.  And the food was superb.  The breakfast buffet was full-blown Hilton at its best, and the price was reasonable for what you got (we had ""free"" upgrade here, but still, the";5
We spent a week in Marrakesh, staying at the Riad Kheirredine.  The Riad is gorgeous and tranquil, with beautifully decorated rooms.  However, the stand out of this Riad is the incredible staff.  The hotel staff almost anticipate your every need, from taxis to go to dinner, a guide for the Medina, directions to Les Jardins Majorelle - and are absolutely consistently helpful, friendly and caring.  I am a world traveler and have stayed at many world class hotels, and the Riad Kheirredine completely outdid them all in terms of service!  I loved Marrakesh and cannot wait to return - but I also want to come back to the Riad, which started to feel like home.  I cannot recommend Riad Kheirredine enough!;5
Had a wonderful time in Los Angeles/Hollywood, the hotel is well placed to most major attractions or a train ride away. Many thanks to all who attended us, and like most I had the pleasure to meet Pil at the front desk, and his reviews don't fall short of his charm and delightful nature, I'm definitely staying here again time and time again;5
Our spacious room on the 8th floor had a view of the Lincoln Center which was beautiful at night. We had excellent buffet breakfast every morning with fresh cut fruit and fresh squeezed juices. Everyone was super polite and helpful,l and we could not have been happier with the Empire. We attended three performances at the Lincoln Center, just walked across the street.;5
A fantastic oasis of luxury with genuinely friendly hosts along with great customer service makes this one of the best places I have ever stayed. We stayed for three nights and could have easily stayed longer. The rooftop terrace overlooking the Medina when the calling for prayers is being sung out from a myriad of mosques as the sun sets in the distance was a fantastic and unforgettable experience. Deserves the number 1 spot and then some.;5
First of all I never write reviews. I just come on trip adviser to read reviews.   But my stay at Riad Kherridine was so good I had to sign up and post my review. I have stayed at many 5 star places all over the world but this Riad in Morocco was my favorite.  They staff at this Riad take care of the customer and always make sure to make you stay the best. The manager Elaine was so good and always asked us what we needed and if we needed a guide to help us walk through he Souks or any other minor details most places donât give you.  Since it was my first time in Morocco I was unsure about the area. This Riad gives everyone a cell phone and map to make sure you are never lost. If you are they will send someone to find you. Also every time you leave the Riad you have the option of;5
Amazing customer service! Nelson G is who I had the pleasure of helping me check into the hotel and his customer service is phenomenal. Very kind, helpful, and recommended things and places to check out while Iâm here on my trip. Rooms are clean, gated parking! Highly recommended, and I will for sure keep coming back!;5
Maricela Dovila was awesome!! She greeted us daily with a smile.  She made our dining experience memorable.  She never made us feel uncomfortable.  This hotel is amazing from the staff,  food,  and being extremely clean. Can't wait to get back.;5
From the moment we pulled up outside until we left to continue our travels, this hotel was perfect. Very friendly Staff and when we checked in we were given the option to upgrade our room for an extra $20 a night. We were very happy to do so and we got a cracking corner room overlooking universal studios. The room we got was fantastic, the buffet breakfast was one of the best we experienced on our travels of the west coast. And the hotel is a 5 - 10 mins walk to Universal Studios and the Citywalk for Restaurants. The hotel also provides a free shuttle to these areas all day, but the walk is nice after a big meal. Cant recommend this hotel enough!;5
Nice hotel with a great location. The hotel itself looks antique but rooms were clean and cosy with 2 small-double beds which were extremely comfy, lots of storage space too. Friendly staff, free wifi and telephone in the room.;5
The location of this hotel is just about perfect. It is across the street from Lincoln Center. If you are in NYC to see the Metropolitan Opera, the Philharmonic or the Lincoln Center Theater, then this is the best place to stay. In addition to being across the street from Lincoln Center, it is within walking distance (assuming that you are not wearing high heel shoes or the weather inclement) or a quick cab ride to some of the great NYC museums. It is also easily accessible to the shops on 5th Avenue. There are restaurants close by to this hotel, plus a Starbucks and a 24 hour pharmacy which seemingly sells about everything you could ever need. I found it quite convenient to go to this pharmacy and pick up some yogurt, bagels and orange juice for breakfast.  Inside the rooms are;5
The Hollywood Hotel looked stately, and a welcome port in the storm that had been our first day in the city. As I walked though the front doors I was immediately met by the clean, warmly lit, and elegant atmosphere that bore us on to the front desk. Here we were greeted by Michael and Brian who were by far the most memorable and heart warming part of our stay. I truly felt from the service we received from our hosts that they were doing everything in their power, not just to make our check in smooth, and to put us at ease, while also taking the time to make sure we were fully acquainted with the amenities of the hotel including nearby transit options. Any concerns we might have had they relieved in moments and before we knew it, key in hand we were off on our way. I do not know;5
The staff at this hotel are second to none!!! Jeff is the main man who can help with anything!! Not only can he do the usual but he goes above and beyond, offering advice and even life lessons if needed! Every visitor needs to spend ten minutes in his company.... he makes you a better person!!! ð Everybody is attentive and even if things donât go to plan the managers call you back with an immediate solution. Great location too, will recommend it to everybody who is visiting my son who is here for the summer!!;5
"Hugo and his team are the best! Best service, omelettes and waffles in the city! ;) You have to love them! I will definetely come back soon. :) The location and is just perfect and the rooms are beautiful. Best wishes, Marcello";5
Outstanding location and service.  I recommend the hotel very highly. The room was comfortable and well appointed and maintained during my stay for a week.  The location is amazing and I was able to walk to broadway shows etc.  The staff was friendly and eager to be of assistance.  I felt valued and cared for.  I will be back.;5
This Hilton is my LA Hotel of choice, particularly as a Hilton Honors Silver Level - they go out of their way to provide the best room available.;5
We were forced to cancel our trip and stay here this month due COVID-19 reasons. Neida was super helpful and made the cancellation process very easy for us. Customer service is is definitely a 10/10!!!;5
Just back from NYC staying at this hotel. Very modern, rooms were larger than expected and tasteful decorated. Beds were massive and large closet to store clothes, shoes, suitcases. Room cleaned daily. Room offered a fully stocked mini bar and snack though very expensive. Staff were very friendly especially Jeff who attended the front door, arranged airport pick up for us. Will definitely use this hotel again. Very Central to Central Park, Times Square without the noise.;5
Extremely well situated hotel at a very good price. Friendly personell and large and cleam room. The bed could have been longer as i am quite tall (1.90m). Coffee every morning, which is very much appreciated. Personally havent made use of the gym.;5
I had the best experience at this hotel. I visited out of town for a few days for a trip and decided to stay at this hotel. Overall I felt so welcomed. Jermaine at the front desk very helpful and I thank the company for having such a helpful person at the front desk because I have been to many hotels where the front desk person isn't nice. I will definitely be back at this hotel when I am on this side of town.;5
We stayed at the ameritania at times square for 4 nights. Let me start by telling you that is the perfect location to get everywhere, just a few blocks of all broadway theaters and even close enough to walk all the way to central park. Subway also less than 5 minute walk  The staff is very kind, friendly and helpful.   The rooms are a great size and all room amenities are great quality.   The look of the hotel is modern with an edge, tons of red! We enjoyed our stay and we felt really pampered. For sure we will come back next time!;5
We feel that we really lucked out at this riad. The welcome we had after driving from M'hamid to Marrakesh was exactly what we needed! The manageress and her staff could not have done more for us. The complimentary fruit, water, coffee & phone in case we got lost were lovely touches. The room was unique, the terrace was an oasis, the location was great, the staff exemplary and atmosphere SO relaxing. Thoroughly recommended.;5
I live in Connecticut and like to frequent New York City. I love the location of the Empire Hotel. I can get about very easily to most places. I travel alone when my husband cannot come with me. I feel very safe there and the staff are extremely professional and try to meet my needs. I will return.;5
We came to NYC for our son's wedding and arrived early to explore the city.  The hotel was conveniently located and walking distance to many of our destinations.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and made our stay there quite pleasant.  Rooms were clean but quite small, although I heard this is typical of Manhattan hotels.  Older building but well-maintained.  Tick Tock diner on site was a real treat to experience.   Our room was surprisingly quiet for being on such a busy street.   Wi-Fi was provided but it was very slow.I would stay here again if I wanted to be close to Penn Stations and the Theater district.;5
Just back from an amazing stay. Itâs the first Iâve stayed at this hotel & it will definitely be on the list to stay here again. The room was clean & spacious we had a view of the Empire State Building. The staff were friendly & helpful.;5
All the time we video shooting in LA we stay at the Hollywood Hotel. Big shout out to Pil he the GOAT always looking out for our production. Must stay for all up and coming this is the spot. Certified;5
Hyatt Regency LAX is an outstanding property with pleasant rooms, sound-proof double paned windows, and an inviting lobby.  Reasonable ($22 a night) self-parking is available in a garage directly behind the hotel.  The pool area was outstanding.  I would stay here even when not flying in/out of LAX.;5
Great location- close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, just a short walk to Times Square. The attached Tick Tock Diner served excellent meals.  Friendly staff. Our reception clerk, Mohammed, was especially helpful. He upgraded our room to a suite with two bathrooms, which made our stay even more enjoyable.  We were very pleased with this experience, and this will be our first choice for our next stay in midtown Manhattan.;5
Chef Hugo made a great breakfast with excellent customer service by personally engaging people on how their stay was and suggesting places to go. He brought orders to tables whenever he could which was almost always.;5
We had a pleasant stay at the Ameritania over the Labor Day weekend with our family. Great location. Nice rooms. Pleasant staff. Huge thanks to Jeff for taking care of us and providing  5 â­ï¸ customer service!;5
Being the biggest Gossip Girl fan the Empire has always been the top of my list for a New York stay and finally on our third trip my husband gave in and off to the Empire we went! I have to admit we were slightly concerned as had read some reviews that were not great at all but we were blown away but how inaccurate they were!!! On arrival the hotel lobby was buzzing, so much to take in! We checked in and were told we had been upgraded and congratulated on being in New York to celebrate our honeymoon! Once we got to the room we were amazed, it was huge (by NY standards) and really clean! We had an amazing 5 night stay at the Empire, we loved the rooftop bar and hope to return in the Summer when the rooftop pool is open!;5
"In May 2017, a college friend and I enjoyed a mini reunion in Manhattan, staying 2 nights at Ameritania Hotel before I had to change hotels (boohoo) for another gathering. We loved the Ameritania lobby's whimsical ambience + the charming & helpful desk team. A man named Jeff was especially on top of things and gave a great restaurant recommendation. Our double-bed room was quite small but very comfortable + the bathroom shower was so modern and fabulous. Great water pressure from the ""rain head."" I will make a beeline for this hotel next time I am in New York. (I live in Santa Fe, NM.)";5
Arrived as our first stop on our honeymoon after a 14 hour flight. Checkin allowed us to checkin at 9am for an extra $25. Very worthwhile and made our first day much less exhausting!  Was an amazing room on the executive level and breakfast was amazing with the continental included in the room.  Lovely staff, great location and would highly recommend.;5
Great 2 night stay at the Hilton. First class service, bar and room facilities amazing. Ideally situated next to Universal theme park, citywalk and a short Uber to Warner Bros studio tour. Got early access to room, nothing too much trouble. Great staff from reception through to concierge. The only place to stay when visiting Universal studios. I will definitely return !;5
We had a great time at the Hilton Universal. Shuttle to City Walk and Universal Studios and Theme Park made coming and going so easy. Also easy to get to Warner Bros. Studios. Hotel Bar was also nice - and convenient! Staff was friendly and helpful. No complaints!;5
The best and most convenient hotel if youâre going to the theme park. Top notch service and awesome amenities. Really felt safe during the pandemic. Not bad for the price either. Make sure you mention that youâre a hilton honors club member so you can unlock special privileges as well;5
I like the vibe of the room. Very artsy, definitely felt like I was in LA. The room only had one small garbage can in the bathroom. That was a bit odd. I appreciate the care package provided by the staff for a gift certificate to LA Unity and some snacks. A very personal touch during the pandemic!  I would say I was overall impressed with the room and building.;5
I canât say enough about Pil, he went way above and beyond to make our vacation amazing. We traveled through California for our first time, and Pil helped us with everything, he checked us in with a great smile and charming personally. He advised us how to get around and where to go in Hollywood, during our stay he helped me book my first ever Catalina experience, not only the boat ride but also place to stay. If you are celebrating any special occasion please make sure to ask for Pil, he will not let you down. Thank you so much. The hotel is perfect for honeymooners, let Pil know and he will hook you up. The room he set us up in was AMAZING, the courtyard view is incredible, pool is mind pleasing, I can go on and on. Thank you Hollywood Hotel you made my first time in;5
I went to NY with my boyfriend and this was the best option to stay one night. It was really close to Central Park and it's really easy to get there by train... The service was really nice to us, the room is clean, and the [private] bathroom was good.;5
First stay in New York and we loved this hotel. There were 3 of us so we had a room with 2 double beds and a sofa bed. The bedroom was quite big with the bedroom separated from the couch/ sofa bed area. The best part of the room was an outdoor patio with the best view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens! The weather was beautiful this week so we spent the morning before heading out, and the evening before bed out there - what a view!!  The beds were comfortable and the shower had lots of pressure. The subway was right by the hotel and so many of the locations we wanted to see were within walking distance. We would recommend this hotel for sure!;5
perfect location for visiting.  Tick tock diner right in hotel.  rooms very small, very small..outdated rooms and bathrooms, but this is a very old hotel.  The location was perfect for our tip, right next to Penn station and w/I walking distance to all midtown manhattan stuff.  Hotel staff friendly and helpful;5
I travel to NYC multiple times a year have stayed in many different budget hotels and hostels all over the city.  This is by far the best value in Manhattan.  At around $100/night you get extrememy fresh linens, flat screen TV, and a very comfortable bed.  The shared bathrooms are immaculate and they even provide bathrobes.  What other budget hotel does that?!  I feel like its their attention to the small details is why i like it so much.  Also, they have a elevator operator (neat!), a great cafe off the lobby for breakfast or an afternoon pick-me-up, and a great bar.  It's basically an awesome hotel at a hostel price.  Yes, the rooms are small. But its Manhattan and you only paid $100.  Plus, who hangs out in their hotel room in NYC anyway.  Its just your luggage that needs a;5
Recently took a trip down to New York with a colleague for business. We were staying at the Empire hotel on the upper westside. Couldn't ask for better location, ton of city life and excitement right outside the doors of the hotel, as well as easy access to the subway and downtown core. Facilities and staff were exceptional with a great sized room for two queens (even had a couch and lounging area). Haven't seen rooms of this size at the pricepoint and quality anywhere in NYC in previous trips. They also have a great restaurant on the second floor as well as a rooftop bar that was BUMPING on both nights that we stayed. Looking forward to visiting again this summer when the rooftop pool deck opens as well. Recommend this hotel for anyone going down for business or pleasure.;5
Chef Hugo is the highlight of this hotel experience! Average room, but outstanding breakfast & personality from Chef Hugo every morning made the stay exceptional! The staff in the dining area all very pleasant & made our breakfast something to look forward too!  Another great benefit at this hotel was the people in the gift shop on the first floor! Such welcoming and helpful people! Helped us find our way around & saved the day by having the items we needed on hand for a reasonable price!  Wish the pool was heated !;5
The Jane is THE place to stay when you're in NYC! Not only is it affordable, it's also very chic and the locations great! A few blocks from the subway station. Service is great and staff is friendly!!;5
great location, awesome staff who go out of their way to make you comfortable - great diner attached to the hotel, Art Deco decor - great security you need to show your key to access the elevator to the rooms.  Concierge was super helpful and patient.;5
This riad (house) is made up of three houses with a open center courtyard, beautiful rooms, many comfortable and charming places to hang out, a great rooftop terrace, a wonderful restaurant and the nicest most helpful staff.  The medina where it is located (old part of city) is a maze of alleys ---  easy to get lost --- but whenever we left the riad, they insisted on walking us out to the main street.  The riad itself is just beautiful and so relaxing --- an oasis in a bustling city.  We were made to feel so welcome and it is without hesitation that this is a great place to stay!;5
Had a great time staying at the hotel. The rooms are nice and the service is great! Went to the bar a few times and had some delicious drinks. Only once did I have a room service order error and a nice lady named Mor fixed it and followed up that everything was fine.;5
Modern, spacious and clean room right at the entrance to LAX.  Reasonably priced for the ammenities and quality.  We couldn't ask for more.  Shuttle goes every 15 minutes of so. This is now our LAX hotel of choice without question.;5
My husband and I stayed at The Empire Hotel for 2 weeks, from 01/01 to 15/01, and all I have to say is that was an amazing experience. We loved everything, the courtesy of the reception, the excellent accommodations, the decoration and the delicious breakfast. The manager, Ricky Jones, allowed us the best stay in our lives, with a super professional treatment, extremely caring. We will recommend strongly The Empire Hotel, our second home in NY, since now!;5
From beginning till the end, just simply amazing. Top notch right i  the heart of the city. Doesn't get any better then this. Will definitely be back. Till next time Ask for Randy at the Front desk. He's a cutie;5
I'm not going to lie but I was dreading this hotel due to all the bad coverage it's been getting. From the minute I arrived I loved it! If you are like us and on a budget this hotel is fab! The reception staff were helpful and the maid service was spot on with clean bedding and towels every day of our visit! If you go out of the hotel and go left and then take the 1st left again and walk to the end there is a little grocery shop that sells hot food, perfect place to pick up a breakfast muffin on the go. 4 blocks from the subway station at either side and you aren't ever on the train longer that 15-20 minutes to get anywhere. The subway is the fastest and best way to get from hotel to downtown. $31 gets you a 7 day unlimited pass for the subway if you are doing more than a few;5
My wife and I travel for both work and leisure and we have stayed at the Empire on many occasions.  Big hotels can be impersonal and not always helpful but when it concerns the Empire we cannot fault the welcome, the Front Desk and the Concierge, the ambiance of the bar and  lobby and the bedrooms.  In particular, the ladies and gentlemen who actually make sure that the amenities and rooms are certainly as good as they say.     Mari J;5
Stayed here with my parents and sister in the middle of August. As soon as we landed in the airport the 5* service began with being picked up by private driver. From the time we arrived to the time we left, the service, food and quality of the Riad were amazing. All the staff were so willing and kind. Sara along with all the reception staff were very helpful with recommendations. Will definitely be back!;5
I can definitely recommend and Iâll definitely return. My family can contest to this as well. Thank you for your hospitality. My trip was well worth every minute spent. The food and drinks were delicious and if I didnât have a budget, Iâd definitely try everything on the menu.;5
"I was concerned about this hotel as not all the reviews are great but was pleasantly surprised!  Great location, friendly staff and very clean !  The rooms are "" Nice and Clean ""!  The beds are very comfy with nice and soft pillows. The front desk person was the nicest gentleman and a really good guy. The hotel restaurant is wonderful , we had a selection of juices, yogurt, fruits, croissants, bagels, muffins and crispy waffles, breakfast was extremely good and the customer service we received was outstanding, specially from Sonia, this lady was friendly and welcoming. I would 100% recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again.";5
Pil was great and rlly nice and welcoming. He treated us with respect and was rlly helpful when we needed something or help from the front desk. Hopefully we can come back again sometime to this hotel;5
amazing hotel with very friendly staff  old and dated but this is what adds to the charm   situated on 8th Avenue the hotel is very busy the lobby is steeped in nostalgia with a huge chandelier and old photos do the roaring 20s  there is actually a museum underneath the hotel that has lots of photos of Al Capone and what the hotel looked like in the 20s  our room was on one of the top floors and the view was breath taking you could see for miles   we flew into Newark airport and it was so easy to then get the rail right to 8 th Ave  very cheap too   The rooms were spotlessly clean with comfortable beds We didn't eat at the hotel so sorry can't comment   considering the hotel is massive it was quiet at night   checking in was very fast no waiting  The hotel is central and getting;5
"Wow, we did not expect the reception we received, but were pleasantly surprised. Not only did the front desk staff spend time finding us a room that met our expectations, but they called to make sure we were satisfied, not once, not twice, but 3x!! This hotel has a staff that enjoys their jobs. So much so that the housekeeping staff refused a monetary tip and I quote. "" It is a pleasure just to serve you."" Where do you get that kind of service ever!!! Now this is an historic hotel. The rooms can be small if you are not using the guide provided by the hotel. The hotel lets you know, out in front, the square footage of each room. The staff will work with you to find the best option for your stay AND help you get an amazing view of the Manhattan skyline. We already started looking";5
I was just happy with the whole situation everybody what professional and knew what they were doing. Been going there for the past four years and will continue. There was no I in that team and I really appreciate that;5
so, im sitting in room 448 of the jane hotel at this very moment writing this review. i'd just like to say, this is probably the COOLEST hotel ive ever ever been to.  i love it here. i seriously want to live here. ive never been to the chelsea hotel, but i have a feeling The Jane is going to have the same sort of cult following someday.   the rooms are small, but seriously, who spends all day in their hotel room in new york anyway? they have everything you really need, tv, ac, bath robes, flipflops, clean towels, windows that open, the bathrooms are clean, the showers are clean, the elevator is AWESOME, the location is classy, the employees are respectful and helpful.  its like darjeeling limited, mixed with chelsea hotel, mixed with the titanic.   i actually stayed in the room;5
Wonderful location near Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Central Park. We walked to hotel from Penn Station, up 7th Ave. Lots of fun to see sights that way. I would fix elevators AND mark stairs, as I would have taken stairs if they were not so bleak looking.;5
Close to many attractions. Hotel shuttle to and from City Walk.  Hop on Hop off tour pick up at hotel. Very pleasant stay. Continental Breakfast was  included . Great selection of healthy breakfast foods;5
Where do I even begin - this is hands down the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we travel a lot! The places we stay at are very important to us: we always do our research and look for the best options. I now know that the 5* ranking this hotel has on this platform is more than deserved. There is not one thing wrong with this place - everything is perfect. The decor, interior, how calm and quiet everything is, how everybody can find a place for themselves. It is a quiet oasis in the quite chaotic Medina. We really loved Marrakech overall - all the rush, energy, souks, people, but of course it can get a little overwhelming at some point and it was always such a pleasure to come back to this paradise. The restaurant is amazing, we had dinner there every night (we stayed there;5
My brother and I stayed at the Jane Hotel for 4 nights in June 2017 to see Billy Joel. We were very pleased with our stay. The rate was excellent comparatively, the room was small as expected however all amenities were available in a tight space. Bathroom/shower were always clean. Front desk were great and Jamie, hotel manager was excellent to deal with (our flight was delayed from Nova Scotia). Neighborhood was very charming, close to bike path on the Hudson river and the free bike rental was icing on the cake. We have booked for June 2018 and can't wait to come back!;5
We had a pleasant stay. The bellman, Anthony, was quite helpful. Wall paper in our room makes the property appear old. The shuttle van to Universal Studios was convenient. Nearby public transportation takes you to many places to see.;5
We arrived at 1PM. Pleasantly surprised to find out that the room was ready and we had been upgraded.  The room was clean and comfortable. Even though we were right at the airport you couldnât hear the planes taking off.;5
Empire Hotel was great, location, ++, rooms were tidy and small, view was fun, to see Lincoln Center and looking down Broadway and Amsterdam.  Can't beat the location, surrounded by culture and many restaurants to choose from.;5
I am always impressed how every staff member is intent on making my personal stay the best. There is always so many welcoming smiles whenever I enter a Hilton.You made my wife and daughters birthday trip to Universal Studies extra magical.;5
Spent spring break at the Hilton LA/Universal. First visit for the kids to Universal. You can actually walk there. Staff at the Hilton were very friendly. This was our first time traveling with our dog and realized this hotel is so pet friendly. By day 2 everyone knew Championâs name. Hotel has a water fountain with a filter like the ones at the airport so you can fill your water bottle. Great and useful feature, being friendly with the planet.;5
Modern industrial look. All the staff were friendly and eager to help. A concierge contacted me upon arrival to ask if I needed anything.  Had left an item in a room which they had in lost an found- very pleased!;5
Myself and 3 friends stayed here for 4 nights. Our rooms had two beds and two bathrooms which was great. We knew about the room tax before we arrived so although we didnât understand  what we were paying for it wasnât a surprise. A mess up with check in saw us having our tax reduced by half. The staff were all friendly. It says a lot when you see Virgin flight crew there, canât be bad!! The hotel is in a perfect location and close to great shops and areas of interest. It could use a lick of paint in some areas but the room was clean and tidy. We had tea/coffee making facilities (no milk though so had to use their creamer). During our stay we got advice about Uber and were advised on how to get a taxi to JFK. The guys outside flagged us down a taxi easily and we got to the;5
Front desk staff was amazing in helping me with everything I needed! Both Gustavo and Nancy went above and beyond in helping my family have a great stay! Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.;5
"You can't beat this Hyatt for convenience.  The shuttle comes every 6-10 minutes or it is an easy walk .  Gabby in reception and Cairo in the lounge were exceptional. The rooms are comfortable and impressively quiet considering it is in the middle of the airport!  If you have lounge access you might be a bit disappointed but overall this is my ""go to"" property at LAX.";5
I stayed overnight between flights and wanted a calm environment with good food and service.  The van service between the airport and hotel was prompt and helpful with my luggage. I highly recommend the Hyatt at the Los Angeles airport;5
The Empire is in a very good location--near Central Park, The Ballet, Musuems, The Lincoln Center, Shopping and Time Square just to mention a few! The staff there were amazing and ALWAYS friendly and helpful...I would highly recommend The Empire Hotel;5
Great atmosphere and staff. Will definitely be back! The room was larger than any other Iâve stayed in in NYC and I visit about 4 times a year. The added security of checking room keys before guests entered the elevators was very comforting. Come on, itâs New York!;5
Just returned from a four day stay and as other reviewers have said the service here is fantastic. All the staff introduce themselves when you arrive and line up to say goodbye when you leave. They are always smiling ,polite and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. The breakfasts are huge and kept us feeling full all day. The orange juice served is the freshest I have ever had and my husband loved the olives which they serve you with drinks. The staff also made me a lovely hot chocolate one evening before bed. We stayed in the 'eucalyptus' room which is in the older part of the Riad . The bed is so comfortable I had no trouble falling asleep each night which can happen sometimes when you are in a strange bed.;5
I did not have the highest expectations of this hotel only because we paid less than $300 a night in Manhattan. Boy was I so thrilled to find this gem!!!   For our $289. a night we had 2 very clean rooms (the bedroom and livingroom) 2 full bathrooms, 2 flat screens with all the channels in a super attractive vintage art deco space. I'm sure the decor was original yet extremely well maintained.   We were right in the heart of Manhattan, close to many must see NYC attractions and close to the subway so it was just a hop to get to all of our destinations.  We will be back in June!;5
This was our first time in New York and we have been amazed at how helpful everyone at this hotel has been. Jeff the bell man has been exceptional he will go above and beyond to try and make the experience the best. Jauvier behind the bar was brilliant aswell he also made the holiday for us. Jeff and juavier are a credit to the hotel so we would definitely stop again thanks again for everything.  Em and Sam.;5
We very much enjoyed our stay at the Empire. The location couldn't be better, close to the Lincoln Centre and Central Park, and a short walk to Times Square. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had two meals at Ed's Chowder House and found it to be first-rate. We had a great room with a great view to the north up Broadway. All extremely positive except for the blast of cold air that funnelled from the front doors into the lobby.;5
I have travelled all over the world and stayed in many different hotels in NYC. This is one of the best values in NYC. It's clean, the beds are big and comfortable, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, great location, subway across the street so you're close to everything, remodeled on upper floors, just really great. This is not a luxury hotel, but if you're looking for a clean, comfortable room bigger than the B'way district, this is the place. Can't say enough about it.;5
After reading other reviews I always like to make my own mind up and then share my thoughts. I have to say I was more than impressed with this hotel, The New Yorker delivers everything you need for a stay in New York, comfort, amenities, location and a little but of history thrown in! The double metro rooms may be compact but they are beautifully decorated and maintained to a high standard, we had more than enough room for the very little time we stayed in there! Get out and enjoy the city People! The staff were friendly in their welcome and throughout our stay. This hotel is literally a street crossing from Madison Square Garden, Macy's and the Empire State building which we had an amazing view of from our room, and a short walk from Times Square, Central Park is only 30 mins;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for a week in March, very very impressed, location is fantastic, a short walk to Macyâs, Times Square, madison square garden, penn station to name but a few.  Staff were always very friendly and I liked the fact there was security guards on the lifts so you literally couldnât gain access without a key card, also the room was cleaned to a high standard every morning without fail. The check in was really quick and easy to do, and a $300 hold on my debit card for incidentals. I booked with virgin so all my fees were included such as internet and resort fees, the Wi-Fi was reliable and easy to set up, also had access to the fitness centre if needed. We upgraded to a metro view room for $30 per night and paid $30 for a fridge in the room which was perfect for;5
We stayed here for a week, and prior to our arrival we were concerned about the location and hotel in general due to some of the bad reviews. None of it turned out to be true. We are 2 girls in our 20's, and had no problems at all. The area may look a little shady, but that's just what the non-tourist part of LA looks like. We took the subway  day and evening, and took cabs by night - and we felt completely safe the whole time. Yes, the hotel is a little worn-out, there was a few cracks in the wall, but it's great for the price. It's close to everything you wanna see, staff was really helpful, and facilities were clean. The Wifi could have been better though.;5
Three of us stayed in a suite and the space was amazing and clean. We had a great view of Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens. The hotel was quiet except for the outside sounds which are simply sounds of the city. The location is great with quick access to shopping and a few minutes to Times Square. The hotel is older so not as modern as expected but the space, cleanliness and location made it an excellent choice.;5
Very convenient location. Great places for lunch and breakfast nearby. Subway station short walk. Most of all, hotel staff very helpful in booking tours, transport within city and to airport. Desk staff, Chris Majid, had us booked on a Harbor Lights cruise within the hour of our arrival so we could see New York at sunset. Said was always smiling and ready to help us figure out how to navigate the subway to see the city. When we go back to NYC again, we will be booking at this hotel.;5
TL:DR- Great Hotel. Clean rooms. Mylka and the front desk team are great. Perfect for Griffith park & Greek theatre.   This is the 2nd time weâve stayed at the Hollywood hotel. Weâll definitely be back.   I previously worked for a large hotel corporation as a hotel front office manager, and have pretty high standards for service- Hollywood hotel has exceeded those expectations. Check in is a breeze. The parking is easy and convenient at the lobby. From the moment we walked in Mylka was attentive and engaging. Sheâs a great addition to to their front desk team and the personality of the hotel.   Overnight parking is just as quick and easy. Pull around the corner, wait for the gate and park. The price is definitely reasonable, and worth it.   For the concert goers, or those;5
- Great location - Friendly and very helpful staff - The best and caring concierge service, especially Cindy. She was a great helper! - the worst cleaning service - reception might be helpful, might be nervous  - everyday my electronic key failed. The worst i've ever met so far - but I would love to stay at this hotel again!;5
Really impressed by the care shown by the staff. They are so attentive and eager to make your trip the best it can be. Every convenience has been thought of. They truly want to share their city with you.  The room was gorgeous, clean, with many amenities. Service was excellent. Breakfast on the terrace was a wonderful experience and such a great way to start the day. The views are incredible!  Location is fantastic, right in the middle of many attractions. We were able to walk to most attractions, which was a great way to experience the city. Very kind of the Riad to have employees walk with you through the winding streets.;5
"Tried to find an different adjective from other reviews to say how wonderful this Riad is.   Please take as read how good the service and food are, others have mentioned the phone the assistance and advice on finding booking restaurants and day trips; getting around the Medina, I don't think I can add any more to the positive comment of others.  It was service above and beyond and at a level that wasn't in any way intrusive but seemed to give a level of support to our holiday which just made it all more relaxing. In fact whole raid had seemed to have such a relaxed atmosphere.  The only extra advice I can offer; if you have tried to book the Riad but it seems to full, contact them directly.  There wasn't one room available for us for all of are time in Marrakesh, but they";5
The stay was all that we expected.  Nice location in city, the hotel was very thorough on security and the stay was great.  We got good recommendations from the help desk on restaurants and things to see and do.;5
The staff were pleasant. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.The bar area was nice with decent cocktails and good buffalo wings. The valet were quick with retrieving my car. The location is convenient to LAX.;5
"Stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days while in NYC over the Thanksgiving holiday.  I stay here often; itâs my âgo toâ place when in the city.  Great place!!  People are friendly, service is very good at checkin, though they gat busy at times ( like all hotels will ).  Special room requests are met quickly. Itâs a great place to stay when in midtown Manhattan, especially for an event at MSG.";5
My husband and myself stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon. Hotel was lovely staff were friendly and welcoming. Rooms clean and cleaned every day with fresh towels. Room maybe a bit on the small side but can deal with it since your not there to spend time in your room. Had lovely views was able to see the Statue of Liberty. Walking distance from Empire State Building and Times Square. So found it a great location. Would stay here again.;5
"I stay at the New Yorker Hotel several times a year. Every January, I ""live"" there for close to ten days. The hotel has been renovated over the past few years and the rooms are large and spacious. Several of the suites have balconies that overlook the city. The staff is incredibly helpful and the rooms are always spotless.  One of the selling points is the location. You are across the street from Penn Station and steps from several subway stations. The public transit line (bus) runs right down Eighth Avenue. If you are traveling to the City for business or pleasure, this location is perfect.";5
Wow - what a place! Truly one of the most amazing places I have ever stayed, I can't recommend Riad Kheirredine more highly. As I am sure many people do, we spent hours searching through Trip Advisor trying to find the best Riad we could in Marrakech. Based on the fantastic reviews we booked Riad Kheirredine and I am so thankful we did, there is nowhere that could match it. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special, I've never felt so looked after even in comparison to other 5* hotels stayed in around the world. Every single employee was beyond amazing, and special thank you to Elena who went above and beyond every day. We felt like family and quickly grew used to nothing to lift a finger! The Riad itself is beyond stunning, and the terrace is somewhere to find;5
Beautiful hotel! Didn't have that generic hotel feel when you walk in, it really felt like NYC. Such a great location in the city, close to central park and all the shows. Huge fan of their bar in the lobby because Mor was stellar!;5
We have recently stayed at the Riad for three nights. We arrived very late on our first night and had some trouble with the transfer from the airport, however Marco was very apologetic and we were generously compensated to make up for the hassle. The meal that we were treated to on our first night fully immersed us in Marrakech.   The Riad Kheirredine staff were very attentive without being overbearing and we found the waiters very friendly and helpful. The room was always clean and very comfortable. The extra touches such as the escorts from the riad (when needed) and the mobile phone (in case we got lost) were particularly welcome.    The Riad was a slice of tranquillity in the bustling Medina. I already miss the relaxing afternoons reading on the roof terrace.;5
Great option if you are visiting LA, with the family or business, itâs just a couple of hundred meters away from Universal Studios park and every 15 minutes arrives a Shuttle. The hotel is just prime quality and the food is great to, donât miss the Saturday night sea food buffet.;5
The accommodations were great and staff is friendly and helpful.  The bell staff are very friendly and courteous. The seafood buffet is the best we have ever been to. The selection is vast and the quality of the food is excellent.  Staff in the restaurants are pleasant and courteous, service is beyond expectations. Very conveniently located to Universal Studios with shuttle service to the theme park.;5
"This was our first visit to Hilton Los Angles/Universal City our visit was a wonderful experience. We especially appreciated the service from the valet to the front desk.  A nice young gentleman at the front desk named Stewart (greeted us with warm handshakes) was very attentive to our needs.  He informed us that we were the ""Guest of the Day"" under the ""Blue Energy"" program.  We were given an upgraded room...wait that's an understatement - we received a ""two room suite"".   Complimentary valet parking was provided as well.    Stewart displayed exceptional ""customer focus"", for example, he took us on a brief tour and explained all of the hotels amenities and services.  Stewart personally escorted us to our suite which had fresh fruit, chocolates, water and other well thought of";5
.. I lived in the area next to Lincoln Center years ago but wasn't very familiar with The Empire Hotel. Staying there last week i discovered one of my new favorite locations in the City. The staff on check-in were wonderfully gracious and welcoming especially 'Pasquale' , the hotel decor is an adventure in itself, and the room with it's view of Lincoln Center's Plaza was a delight. I will be returning to The Empire again and again.;5
Pil is so professional, efficient, and always so helpful. I have zero complaints about his  customer service, worth ethic and compassion. The hotel is clean and nice, the parking is private behind gates, and the cleaning service is great. Thank you so much Pil for making my stay here amazing.;5
Itâs been a long time since Iâve loved a hotel as much as the Jane! Everything was wonderful - super friendly and helpful staff, comfy beds, great AC, a fantastic shower, good restaurant downstairs, and a fabulous location. If I HAD to pick on it, Iâd only say I would like a kettle or coffee maker in the room (since room service isnât available anymore).   I wonât ever stay anywhere else in NYC!;5
Loved this hotel great location lots of original art deco features. Rooms were small but totally fit for purpose bed was very comfy shower was hot and good water power.Security was good and staff were very helpful is in a perfect position to use Penn station a short walk to times square EPS Macys this was my first trip to NYC and this hotel was exactly what i wanted my very own miracle on 34th street;5
In have nothing but good things to say about my stay at the Hollywood Hotel. We received just great treatment, after a terrible experience at LAX airport, things turned around once we arrive at the hotel we were greeted so kindly by the hostess Mr. Pil, he was so friendly and nice to us. Quickly got us to our room and was very attentive making sure we had everything we needed. The room was was very beautifully, just and oasis, just a wonderful stay. Service was very good, I would really recommend it to anyone. We will definitely come back for another stay.;5
Perfect location, the room quite clean and well maintained. Excellent service, very friendly reception and restaurant team. I will definitely repeat and recommend it. You can walk to the main streets and monuments of London. The underground very close.;5
Staff were excellent. We arrived early knowing we would not be able to check. Doorman Ronald was very friendly and helpful in taking our bags for us so we could enjoy our first day. The lady on the desk, who turned out to be the Manager, was dealing with a rather difficult guest when we arrived. She was very polite and professional throughout the interaction. She was very friendly in every encounter we had with her over the course of our stay. Her name is Coral.. Thank You so much. Hotel is literally steps away from the subway.. 2 stops to Times Square. Manhattan diner round he corner, good food, good prices, big portions.;5
My friend and I booked this online and we were completely unprepared for just how tiny the cabin rooms were, but we totally loved the experience! It's in a great location, only a 20 min walk from Union Square (if not less, I have short legs) and the bathrooms were clean and lovely! The hotel is beautiful and a really good spot to stay to explore the city!;5
Perpect ten! Perfect crew, perfect room, and perfect view! Very safe! without a doubt, we will be coming to this hotel the next time we visit New York, and I have already recommended to everyone I know. Thanks;5
No complaints from us.  The hotel was very easy to find and took 4 minutes to walk to from Waterloo underground.  The hotel is very conveniently located, so we managed to walk to everywhere we had planned to visit.  We arrived at 12pm and stored our luggage and then on returning at 3pm we collected the room key.  All of the staff we encountered- from reception, to bar to cleaners in the loft, ALL of them acknowledged and made conversation with us. It was a really nice experience and environment to be in.  We had breakfast too, weâre seated promptly & food was plentiful and tasted great.  I would really recommend the hotel and have no criticisms;5
Three nights on the 35th floor, Thursday through Saturday nights!  Staff was absolutely great, so friendly and so helpful.  The hotel is in a great location and is beautiful, historic and clean.  The room was on the small side, but clean and comfortable.  We wouldn't have asked for anything different and already have reservations for 5-nights in August!!!;5
Fantastic stay in clean, comfortable roof. Staff has been super helpful with college move in at Fordham University. Great location for college visits and shopping. Will come back again. Highly recommend.;5
I have nothing to fault. I had a lovely stay and will definitely be back. I guess the only thing I would point out, is that the storage space is very little and for two people we would have no where to put our cloths. Not much that can be done about this, but that was the only negative aspect as to the room that I would have. The complimentary coffee / tea in the lobby was a very nice touch.;5
My Wife and I stayed four nights on October 2013. The Hotel is in a nice location with a good selection of restaurants that are short walks away. Room spacious and very clean, including modern furniture and with a nice comfortable bed. WiFi and Gym access is no charge. The breakfast at the restaurant in the Hotel and the service was excellent especially the chef Sonia. On Thursday Sonia cooked my Omelette which resulted very tasty and wonderful. She offered me waffles and sausages Sonia was very nice and friendly overall the food here is delicious huge menu. The only negative thing was that the pool towels need to be replace by new ones. They look like their dirty and old please change them for new ones. The staff was helpful and friendly I would definitely stay again great;5
This hotel was our kauchibg point for several days at Universal Studios. It could it not have been better suited for this purpose. Walking distance to the park, regular shuttle if you aren't up for the walk. The room was great, very spacious and nice decorated. The staff were amazing. Always looking to help and see that we were cared for. My family (wife, two kids) also loved the hotel and their approval of my choice of hotel made me feel great. The restaurant was excellent and room service was timely. Overall, a great experience. We will be back.;5
My husband and I were visiting our daughter  and came in for a drink before we headed back to Nj.  It was a very pleasant experience! The manager Michael spoke with us for a while. We asked him about the rooms in the hotel since the last hotel we stayed in in New York had the smallest rooms we have ever seen!  He assured us they were very comfortable. This is great to know because now we can look at staying there instead of with our daughter in her small apartment.  Also, the bartender Frank, was very nice. He recommended the Rodeny Strong Chardonnay and it was very good.  You have a great staff here. They were attentive without being overwhelming. My husband and I are excited to spend more time in the city and hopefully stay at your hotel.  -Patricia McDermott;5
We had a fantastic time. Some rooms are small, however, you spend most time visiting places, I donât see the big deal with those type of complaints. In general people donât appreciate the human beings  that help you in the reservations, be nice, they are not robots. People complain of everything because they have problems with themselves. Super special  thanks to Samira, Jessica and Lillia.;5
So this hotel has, apparently, budget rooms that are quite satisfactory, but we always stay in the Captain's rooms, which are really quite wonderful. Our first visit we actually had a view, through the bay windows, of the Statue of Liberty! The bedding is wonderful, the bathroom is really nice. This past visit was our third time staying, and it is always great. The restaurant off the lobby seems to be a restaurant in and of itself and we absolutely love it there for breakfast or a cup of tea in the late afternoon. Just around the corner is an Italian restaurant that they recommended, that has become our favorite restaurant as well! Malaparte, be sure to go there for supper!;5
We stayed here for 3 nights.  All staff were very friendly from the time we checked in to the time we left. Great location, convinient to Times Square.  Will stay again if we visit NYC.  One suggestion is if they can also have an option for grab and go breakfast, will be great since buffet breakfast sounded a bit expensive if you have kids who are picky eater's.  Overall excellent place to stay.;5
Great staff.  Friendly and professional.  I felt they were sincerely concerned about my comfort.  I definitely felt like the appreciated my choosing their hotel.  Great location, good restaurants nearby.  Close to subway, and only a few blocks to Central Park.;5
Booked for my wife's 50th birthday. I read all the reviews about disinterested staff and 'the rooms are small'. Well, the room we had wasn't huge but let me tell you, it was very well appointed (loved the nespresso coffee machine !) and was big enough for what was needed. The staff were EXCELLENT- we found them friendly, attentive and all of them seemed genuinely concerned that we had a pleasant stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel which is ideally located for all NYC city attractions (and close to Penn Station) and would certainly use it again myself. Would have given them 6 stars if I could.;5
Beautiful window view at intersection was lovely,  bathroom was welcoming and well laid out.  Comfortable sleeping accommodations.  Security guards were on their toes ensuring the safety of hotel guests at the lobby lounge area.  Although their approach was a bit rude,  I understood the intent.  Perhaps best they first announce they will be going around verifying those who are hotel guests and request others be prepared to exit.  As a guest, I felt very uncomfortable the manner I was approached by Security.;5
First of all, the location can't be beat. I grew up in Manhattan and know the neighbors. This one is my favorite for ease of going anywhere without the density further downtown. The hotel building is old, but after staying there over a dozen times, I can honestly say it sure is comfortable and the staff is great.;5
What a great hotel  Big . Modern . Friendly . Full of amenities .   Operated by superb management under the control of Rob Weitz .  We loved it   I came with my two sons a aged 10 and 8 to see Universal and we are glad we stayed here   The breakfast was first class . My boys were in their element .  So close to Universal.  We were looked after from the minute we arrived and I would 1000% recommend staying here;5
After recently staying at The Empire on 63 st, we are already planning our return. The hotel is in a fantastic location for the New York experience. All staff extremely helpful and polite. More than happy to go out of their way to help you!!  Will be going back again!;5
Our family stayed in the New Yorker over the New Year's weekend.  Your team did a great job ensuring a comfortable stay, despite the prevailed Government-mandated Covid restrictions.  Some comments:  - Everyone from reception/check-in to concierge and housekeeping was very positive and helpful.  One of the concierges spent about 15 minutes running down a long list of good suggestions to keep our six-year-old entertained, and told the whole story about Nikola Tesla's residence at New Yorker. - The remodeled bathrooms, with the full-floor showers, are a nice touch. - Many sites in the city are open for visitors, including Liberty cruises, One World Trade, and the American Museum.  Crowds are, for the first time in my memory, manageable. - Restaurants are closed, except for those;5
Fab location fab staff  Linda on check in was just fantastic  Can't wait to return  Great location to universal park Shuttle every 20 mins but only a 6 minute walk away  Pool is fab in middle of the day to get out of the park to recharge batteries for the evening;5
My first time at the empire hotel was outstanding and definitely memorable .  Want to specially thank Claribel who took care of  me and my partner  before we even arrived to the hotel . Her  attention to detail and customer service  Exceeds anything I have ever experienced. The location was  perfect , the  front office staff made me feel welcomed and check in was quick and welcoming . The room was astounding as well as  the cleanliness of the hotel. Thank you empire for a memorable stay I will definitely come back and  tell all my friends and family !!;5
I have used this property to run trading sessions for my association members for many years. You wonât find a better hotel at LAX. Great staff and staff, super good airport shuttle, conference  and meeting support - great. Sleeping rooms quiet for such a location, super views of runways, good food, etc.;5
This is our sixth time here and we feel like it is our second home now.  We do not come to visit the studios but they are really close just a short walk down the hill in a very safe area. The gardens are well kept with an attractive array of flowering plants. Nearby down Ventura Av. there is a very wide selection of fine restaurants.  Check in was painless and fast with  friendly staff who took the time to escort us to the elevators. The room was spacious and clean with good views across the valley with fast wireless ($8). The bathroom was also of a good size with bath tub and shower above. If you decide to have a bath then you can only fill the tub by standing up to turn the water on which is irritating.  The buffet in the restaurant is OUTSTANDING with a huge selection of;5
Stayed here last May (2016), for 3 nights, upon arrival we were upgraded to a beautiful room overlooking the Hudson River. The bed was one of the best we've ever slept in. Room was clean, smart and the facilities were great, especially the vending machines on every floor. Bathroom was a little small, but very nice. The hotel itself is very grand, with excellent staff, and very secure. Excellent location as it is a stones throw away from Madison Square Gardens and Macys. 24 Hour diner is very convenient if arriving at any time of the day/night. Would recommend the hotel to anyone, and would definitely stay here again.;5
Free breakfast with custom omelets!, pristine swimming pool, fitness roon, comedy hour evenings, rental car company on premises if you need a car just one day, frig and MW in the room, walking distance to the subway, extra comfortable bedding, quiet, clean, free internet access--this place has it all. And the kind desk clerk even told us about an authentic Mexican cafe with take-out in walking distance. We ate our supper in the open atrium area of the hotel. That saved us a lot of cash, while providing a culinary delight! We were there for a convention held at the LA Convention Center. The subway took us right to the convention center, and a day pass--$5/day allowed us to travel all over Hollywood, too. We are educators, and we learned how friendly folks are in this area.;5
From the moment we stepped onto this Hilton property we were treated like valued guests.  The valet service was quick and courteous.  Without being asked, the valet told us about the shuttle service and other valuable bits of information to make our stay enjoyable.  Robin, at the front desk,  greeted us with a smile and a friendly personality.  She gave us an upgraded room without asking (as we are Gold HHonors members).  She also gave us information about the hotel to make our stay pleasant.  We used bell service at arrival and departure, each time having Victor help us with our luggage.  What a professional, courteous man he is.  He was at our door within 3 minutes of calling for bell service on our departure.  Other delightful experiences included a fruit/snack basket;5
I've been coming to this Hotel at least once a year for my Universal Studios fix and it's the perfect location.  You can walk to the park or take their shuttle.  I've never tried their lunch buffet and you have to walk past the restaurant to the lobby and the variety of foods look amazing.;5
Absolutely fantastic location when we first arrived check in was quick and easy and thanks to Mohammed we got an upgraded room with spectacular views of the Empire State. Couldn't fault anything about this hotel would definitely stay here again.;5
Manny Ayala was exceptionally friendly, helpful and competent!  Alex and all wait staff at the hotel restaurant were exceptional, so very friendly, efficient and helpful.  Property was clean and accommodating.  Excellent pool and cabanas~ great location to Universal Studios.;5
Nice hotel at a great price, very good location. I had a room with a beutiful view of lincoln center. Interior is very nice. Rooftop bar and Rooftop swiming pool.Staff is very helpful. Doorman Konstantin was very helpful with helping me to find local attractions and place to visit. Five Stars!!!!;5
Wonderful riad, complimented by exceptional staff and service.  The little things - like a complimentary mobile phone, walking escorts to the main square and the always attentive and polite staff make Riad Kheirredine stand out from the crowd.  Highly recommended!;5
"Had read other reviews and was a bit nervous but I have nothing but positive things to report regarding my stay at the Empire. Hotel has a great ""vibe"", is in a great location, and the staff was courteous, efficient and helpful. We'll be back again!";5
Hands down the best service at a hotel. They are super helpful in planning your trip, and will book tours and activities for you before and during your stay. Ask them for some suggestions. They are prompt with responses via email and they are super organized and I can joke that they literally knew my schedule better than I did and made sure everything was well planned.     Room and facilities are super clean and well kept. There was constant maid service throughout the day (more than one times a day) to make sure we have any necessities (like water, paper) and ensure that our rooms are tidy and clean. (They provide you a big bottle of water. Note: You should use bottled water when brushing your teeth).   Safety: We felt super safe at the riad. They provide you with maps, a cell;5
My husband and I stayed here two weeks ago during our honeymoon. We stayed a total of 6 nights and were so sad when that time ended. The reviews on the read our exactly right and I am so glad after doing months of research that we chose Read Kheirredine. I won't write an exhaustive review but rather highlight the items that makes that amazing read stand out.  1. Service: Ive never felt more special when visiting a hotel. Ever! They make you feel like you are the only person staying at this 12 room riad. Every single small detail is considered and executed flawlessly. They are always smiling and going out of their way to see if they can make your stay a great one. Every time we left and every time we returned they offered help with directions, even offered to send someone to walk;5
After reading other reviews, I was skeptical. But my room was lovely. The staff was courteous, especially Daniel at the front desk. He made check-in a breeze and was happy to answer any questions we had. I'd definitely stay here again in the future. Thank you, Daniel!  -Jeff;5
When arrived, were greeted by Happy and we welcomong staff! Without asking, our room was upgraded free of charge! Our room was unexpectedly large! We had a great view of broadway also! Our room was cleaned thoroughly everyday and clean towels replaced daily. The location is perfect, a short walk from Times Square and Central Park. A huge thanks to Jeff who organised our shuttle to the airport which cost us half the price of our taxi cab to get to the hotel from the airport. We had a fantastic time! Thank you NYC, see you soon!;5
The check in was busy but more staff were brought on to deal with the spike. I was given 2 free drink vouchers for the bar which was VERY welcome after travelling for over nine hours.  My room was very small but I was travelling alone and didn't intend to spend much time there anyway. However it was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The shower was spectacularly good - the spray would strip paint from a wall. The wi-fi was reliable for everyday stuff - FB, Twitter, general searches... I didn't stream anything so I cannot comment on that.  There was also a safe in my room for valuables.  Some of the fittings look dated, particularly around the window frames but nothing remotely serious. In fact it adds a bit to the charm of an old 30's era hotel.  I ate in the;5
The Empire Hotel exceeded my expectations in many ways.  Great service, clean, well appointed rooms, friendly staff, perfect location - splendid accommodations!  I highly recommend this hotel for all types of travel to NYC.;5
I traveled with my friends to NY & our stay at the New Yorker was very comfty.  The hotel staff was very friendly.  The hotel itself was very clean, housekeeping staff was visible daily.  Overall, a great stay close to tourism places.;5
Room 4/5: We arrived in the morning after a 14 hour flight from Australia. The staff were unable to accommodate us with a room. A trip to Universal and several coffees later, we were able to check in later that day. The rooms here are beautiful and modern. The beds are welcoming after a long flight with young children. Felt more human the 2nd day.  Quality/Cleanliness 5/5: Fantastic - no complaints.  Facilities 5/5: Admittedly our stay was brief and we weren't able to take advantage of most of the hotel facilities. Universal Studios is just across the street. A free shuttle is provided if you don't want to walk. Highly recommend visiting the Universal Citywalk at night - you'll love to the buzzy atmosphere.  Staff 5/5: Professional and accommodating  Wifi 5/5: Excellent  Advice:;5
As always, it was a fantastic stay, this is the second time I stayed in Ameritania. A hotel in a perfect location, large rooms, clean, quiet, with the most amazing bed! All the staff were great, specially the doormen, all of them! Thank you all! I had a very special birthday!;5
Staff were courteous and polite. Building is slightly tired (understandable given its history) but rooms are modern and comfortable. Fantastic location, walking distance to times square, Central Park etc. And also right next to Macy's for the shoppers! Very close to two subway stops as well. We didn't try the restaurant but we once we tried the diner we kept going back, everything on the menu smelled/looked/tasted delicious. The blueberry pancakes were out of this world! Perfect for when you're too tired to find somewhere for dinner or lunch or you want a nice breakfast! For the price we paid it would be the first hotel I look at booking when I return to New York!!!;5
This hotel is right near the theatre district, Carnegie Hall, and Central Park.  Staff is very helpful.  The bartender, Javier, was sociable and helpful with suggestions about restaurants.  The room was clean and nicely furnished.  And the price is right.;5
Stayed for 6 nights in a 2 room suite with a brilliant view along 34th st over MSG and with great views of the Empire State and Chrysler building. Big and busy hotel but organised staff and very visible security (need to show card to get to lifts). Tick Tock diner excellent and great bar/restaurant in old bank vault underneath the hotel - dont miss it. Location brilliant - subway adjacent and walk to all major attractions.  Cons - small bathroom. A great place to stay in NYC;5
I came out here to California from Dallas Texas for my birthday gathering with some friends and family. Some of my friends stayed here at this hotel and let me tell you it was great.  I had a room facing down town Los Angeles and I was in love. The customer service was great as well. Every staff was so nice and welcoming . I had the pleasure of getting a chance to speak to Jermaine at the front desk who gave my friends and I a few tips around the area to celebrate. Over all, I enjoyed this hotel, staff and city.   I will be coming back next time I am in town.;5
Great location and great hotel. Room was bigger than expected. Could use a better mattress, but that is minor. Close to subway and many top attractions. Would definitely recommend. I'll be staying there again.;5
Love this place.Ideal location for getting around NYC,right next to Columbus circle subway.Nice rooms(tad tired but not desperate)average size for NY.Nice public spaces,modern style,dark but adds to the feel of the place.Starbucks outside the door for that early morning cup.Would recommend for first timers,and those who want something a little quieter and less busier than Times Square.It's also 2mins walk from Central Park!;5
Love this hotel. Very reasonable as NY goes and has been refurbished.  Just checked in today.  Exhausted after an overseas flight and Mohammed was so accommodating for us.  He searched and found a room we could get right away.  Front desk staff going the extra mile in NY is rare.;5
Our daughter had stayed at this property several times and said it was OK.  What we found was that the hotel had great staff, especially Coral at the front desk.  We were given updated rooms and told the entire place is being remodeled.  Our daughter, who remembers the old rooms was very impressed with the improvements.  We were pleased with the room. As this property continues its remodel, it is going to be a great place to stay.  We would go back again tomorrow.;5
Needed some much away from home time, the HH was the right choice, friendly staff, great breakfast, wonderful room, great experience. Pil at the front desk went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, he was always  friendly and always smiled at us just like the rest of the staff.;5
This is probably one of the easiest reviews Iâve ever had to write.  From the moment we walked into Riad Kheirredine to the moment we left we were taken care of like never before.  Such an amazing, warm welcome in the most beautiful setting.  The Riad is stunning and smells amazing!  The log fires were lit and it was just lovely.  We had the Vanilla room and it had everything you could wish for.  The bathtub was something else!  The bed was on the firm side but the pillows very comfortable.  The rooftop of the Riad will take your breath away.  So many little spaces to tuck yourself away in too.  We hardly saw any other guests so it felt very private.  Breakfast on the roof in the early morning sunshine was great.  If you opt for having it in the restaurant then take a jacket as;5
Pleasant and professional reception staff. Many thanks that beautifyl, who was always very prompt in attending my requests, during my numerous stays in this hotel. Very good internet service, both by cable and wireless. Good value for the room price, comparing to similar hotels.;5
Highly recommend this hotel. Majid at 'reception, other reception and porter all helpful during our visit. I will definitely come here again. Their tea was better than Starbucks! Majid please get electric sockets in the lobby. We living in digital world. Wi-Fi in lobby but could do with charging. Thank you;5
Only 2 nights in that nice place, nice rooms ans people very kind. Special tks to Olga and MISTER Banks Jeffrey!!! !-)   You can ask what you want, they find the solution!! Near Broadway and 10 mins from Times square. Ingrid and JÃ©rÃ´me;5
I only stayed for one night but was blown away. Central location a few minutes from Penn station, the staff on reception were really friendly and helpful. I was upgraded to a room with a view for free and could have just spent all my time looking out the window! I was on the 24 floor and the view was unbelievable of the empire state building. The bag storage is really good too so you can leave your bags while you hit Macy's which is just around the corner. I will definitely be back!;5
For our first real visit to NYC, we opted to stay at the New Yorker as Wyndham points holders.  We were very impressed!  The Executive double room was spacious, comfortable (with central air) and had a lovely view of Madison Square Garden.  The beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was especially small, although there was plenty of room in the shower and the remodel of these rooms make everything very new and modern.  The wifi allows for plenty of connections, and is super fast and easy to connect to.  There is a Keurig coffee maker in these rooms, and a CVS across the street, so getting K cups and creamer was super easy.  There is also a nice cold mini-fridge and an excellent insulated ice bucket.  I'm not sure it can get much better for location.  Penn Station subway station is;5
We came to NYC for daughter to audition at Lincoln Center.  Staff was great, even allowed a late checkout to accommodate her later audition time.  Location could not have been any better.  Fitness room was excellent as well.;5
I'm so glad I found the Ameritania.  I searched and compared hotels for weeks before booking a reservation, and the Ameritania was the perfect fit.    Location is great - a few blocks from Times Square in one direction and Central Park in the other.  It's next door to the Late Show on one side and Studio 54 on the other.   All of the staff members were friendly and helpful.  I mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary when I made the reservation and when we checked in, there was complimentary wine in our room.  How nice!  The room was clean and the size was sufficient.  NYC hotel rooms are notoriously small, but the Deluxe King room was a good size for two people, with enough room for storing suitcases without tripping over them.  The bed was comfy and the shower pressure;5
Great stay at the Empire, cool decor, lovely rooftop, excellent staff! The fitness center was well equipped, and although we didn't get to use the pool since it was winter, the rooftop area has a great view of the city.  Our room was comfortable and looked over lincoln Center. Walking distance to Central Park and Columbia Square shops.;5
By far exceeded all expectations, the lobby has the wow factor, glamour art decor, attentive friendly staff, booked a basic queen room, but upgraded to a double twin room with Empire State view as they knew it was my daughters birthday, very clean, and beds extremely comfy ,great location for exploring, won't hesitate to come back again.;5
Iâve been staying at Hollywood Hotel for the last few years every few months for business. Itâs clean, accessible and easy to get to where I have to go. What makes this place exceptional is the customer experience for me. Pil, who works the front desk on occasions when Iâve visited, goes above and beyond. Itâs an exemplary experience and he makes every trip worthwhile. While itâs not a luxury hotel, the effort to make things personable has not gone unnoticed.;5
The room we had was quite small with a queen bed but it was perfectly adequate for me and my daughter and what I would expect for a hotel in such a great, central location.  All the staff at this hotel are helpful and friendly especially Jeff and his team.  I had a couple of problems with transport and my airline and the Reception helped me out with all of this. WiFi I the room can only be paid with a credit or debit card but it is free in the very comfortable lobby.;5
Arrived late to LAX - easy and quick check-in and shuttle came right away to pick us up at the airport.  Staff were very friendly and efficient.  Wait staff at hotel bar were very friendly and the mojito was excellent!  I was surprised that our room was so quiet and we didn't hear any noise at all from the airport and the runway was visible from our room.  We got a handicap room so we had a huge bathroom - my only suggestion is to add more towel racks on the walls.  The carpet in the room was a little drab but otherwise the room was very clean and comfortable.  We ate dinner the next evening at the hotel and although expensive (to be expected) it was very good and the waiter again was efficient and very nice.  I had the prickly pear margarita and it was very good.  Picked up our;5
Fabulous location, excellent shuttle for the airport.  Beautiful rooms, clean comfortable beds, could use more face towels........great price! Would like to see a gift shop added.  Free water at check-in a big plus for me. Well decorated lobby and fully stocked market.;5
Everything was up to par and beyond.  The location was ideal, right next to Lincoln Center.  The view from my window was phenomenal. Yet the room was quiet and comfortable.  Staff were friendly and accommodating.  My stay went without a hitch.;5
We made the reservation at this hotel because it seemed the best price on Trip Advisor.  So, we were really surprised to find that even though we purchased a low-cost reservation, the service was truly outstanding.  The room was large, quiet, very clean and very comfortable.  Staff were friendly and seemed to go out of their way to provide us with things we needed or wanted.  We were here for our 52nd wedding anniversary and on the morning of our anniversary, room service brought us a wonderful complimentary treat of chocolate strawberries and cream, along with a balloon bouquet.  This is really a first-class place to stay.  I doubt that you would regret choosing it for your visit to Universal Studios;5
The cooker Hugo is always friendlyï¼chatty and cordial. He cooks very delicious that makes me look forward to have breakfast everyday. This hotel is worth to liveï¼I had a good time hereï¼thank you Hugoï¼;5
Lovely hotel,  very clean, lovely staff. Its a bit dated but I found that part of the charm.  Rooms were tiny but its what you expect for the money. Its very central with a subway station right outside it s very central and actually its walking distance to lots of places such as Empire State Building,  Intrepid museum, Maddison square gardens, Macy's etc, Broadway and Times square.;5
We stayed at the Hilton for two nights for it's location near Universal City. The Hotel is spotless and staff very professional and friendly. Check-in was efficient and our room witg the panoramic view was amazing. They have a shuttle to Universal every 15 minutes or you can do the walk which takes maybe 10 minutes. Tge restaurants were good and the wait staff attentive and friendly. They also have an on site coffee shop.  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely do it again. Highly recommended!;5
We arrived on a very busy Thursday evening and the hotel was full, however Miguel on front desk went to huge lengths to get us an upgrade to a newer and larger room involving the Manager and Hotel Director. Nothing was too much trouble and we were sent a complimentary bottle of Champagne to the room. The hotel is full of history and in the best spot for Time Square, boat trips, dining and is right next to Madison Gardens, walking distance of Central Park, Macys and the best of shopping. Miguel personally delivered the Champagne to the room, we were so impressed we bought a dozen doughnuts for the front desk staff who all greeted us by name. Get a more recently refurbished room if you can, the Tik Tok Diner is great for a breakfast, eat in or take away. Thanks to all the team;5
A good hotel convient to Lincoln Center events .  Close to subway which is 1.5 blocks away.Good bell service (felt appreciated).    Front desk helpful to resolve issues.  Free coffee in room only for 1st day, afterwhich is $3 per day.;5
We landed lucky with the New Yorker for our first trip to NYC. We needed a hotel that was affordable but hoped for one that would enhance our visit, and this delivered both - thanks especially to a great bit of customer service. Our room, though not large, was clean and smart, with a nod to the building's heritage. However, we'd paid a small supplement for a view and initially had a pretty poor one. We'd arrived late that night but for our remaining two nights, Kristal at reception (apologies if I've spelled that wrongly) found us a high corner room with an incredible view straight onto the Empire State Building from its main window and a different vista from the side. Absolutely majestic: I sat looking out for long stretches of time. I didn't catch Kristal again to thank her;5
We just came back from a two week trip to Morocco and spent our last four nights at this beautiful Riad. We especially loved all the different sitting areas on the beautiful rooftop. We always started and ended our busy days up there. The service is what makes this Riad so special. We were so well taken care of from the moment we arrived!. Thank you to: Siham, Elena, Sara, Lamia, Brahim, and the night guard who is also a talented magician! When we checked out, it felt like we were leaving home. We were hugged by the entire  staff. I definitely recommend this Riad.;5
Great place to stay. Close to Times Square, Central Park, subway entrances. Easy access to any area you wanted to go. Room was clean and restocked every day. Staff helpful with food recommendations. Will definitely be staying again!;5
We stayed here on our visit to NYC to see my daughter who is working at Julliard. The hotel is conveniently located near Julliard, Lincoln Center, Central Park and Columbus circle. The subway is a very short walk. The hotel is beautiful with a nice dark wood lobby and bar. Staff are extremely polite and helpful.;5
This hotel is in a great location. It has beautiful views of Universal City and a free daily shuttle to Universal Studios. The breakfast buffet is great! The valet service was also very efficient. We will definitely return to this hotel.;5
"The Empire Hotel was a fantastic place to stay!  It is conveniently located across from Lincoln Center (which was the location of my event-""The Joyful Heart Gala"") and near great restaurants/shops. My room had a beautiful view of Lincoln Center and it was gorgeous night and day.  The staff was very personable, professional, and extremely accommodating. I look forward to staying there again.";5
From our airport pickup right through to departure the whole experience was amazing. We stayed in the Rose room where the bed was extra comfortable after a long plane trip. Valentina and her staff looked after every aspect of our short stay, from beautiful meals on the rooftop terrace to guides to help us find our way to and from our desired destinations in the medina. Even supplied a mobile phone to call in case we got lost. We needed to walk to work off the huge dinner and breakfast. We will be recommending this highly to all our friends.;5
The staff at this hotel were amazing from the beginning, amazing breakfast, where again the staff were wonderful! We will definitely be back. A great base for exploring hollywood and would definitely recommend using the metro to get to places such as hollywood boulevard and universal studios is a must! We saved so much money using the metro, it costs $1.50 per journey per person or $5 for a day pass. Lovely modern spacious rooms, overall a great stay! The metro is a minutes walk away, you can see it from the hotel!;5
Just before the holidays, one more last ditch effort to make 2014 work well for the business. With staff getting sick left and right, decided to get a room and cover a week of admin support, till our staff can recover and come back to work. The Hilton at Universal filled the ticket, with excellent service, food, and location conveniences to allow me to get to work and return to a wonderful room.  I also brought the family with me who being right next to Universal was able to go and play even though it rained for a couple days while we was there.  We was very pleased with our stay and this made the work week a duo work and mini escape in one.;5
Riad kheirredine is an oasis of calm tranquility in the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The staff( Valentina, yajaira) were extremely friendly and bent over backwards to help us. I forgot my phone charger and in half an hour they found me one. They helped us plan all our trips and advised us on which restaurants to try. And they were spot on. They gave us a telephone while we were there so we could contact them if there was any problem but all went smoothly. The rooms were really funky and decorated in modern marrakech style. Tea and coffee is free all day as is water. The terrace on the roof is amazing. I could have stayed up there with a good book all day. I went with my 3 kids and they loved it too. A special mention also to Elena who looked after us with genuine affection;5
I stay at the New Yorker frequently on business trips.  I enjoy the hotel's history and it's proximity to Penn Station and all the sights of mid-town Manhattan.  It's the staff at the New Yorker that really makes it special though.  I have always had a good experience with the professional and courteous front desk staff but my most recent stay was particularly good.  I had reserved rooms for my daughter, for myself as a business trip and a separate reservation for my husband and to stay in NY socially.  With all that going on, my reservation record was quite confusing and it would have been easy to assume that one of the reservations was mistaken.  Instead, Mohammed called me to ensure he understood exactly what was needed, and ensured that we all had a top notch experience!;5
Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to NYC for my daughters surprise 18th Birthday gift.  The hotel upgraded our room free of charge as a birthday treat.  We had the most amazing view directly opposite the Empire State building on the 36th floor.  The hotel is in a fantastic central position to explore all the sites.  As others had recommended the Tick top diner, we tried it for ourselves.  The food was gorgeous and plentiful, the staff at the diner and the hotel couldn't do enough for us.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for sure!  Thank you to all staff, you did a fantastic job!!!;5
After reading a lot of good reviews I decided to book this hotel. It was well priced and compared to others for the same price it had the best reviews. I was a single traveller so wanted to be sure that I was in a central location. I booked this hotel for a total of five nights but with a break in the middle. I was able to leave my bag here while I went on another trip.  The hotel is very central in Times Square. It's on 54th street, next to where the ed Sullivan theatre is where Letterman was recorded. Very close to Boardway and other Times square activities. I felt safe walking to my hotel at night as there were lots of people around and also early in the morning when it was still a little dark.  It was close to the greyline bus terminal which was one of my objectives, but;5
My visit to The Empire was inspired by it's location which is extremely convenient for the arts resources of The Lincoln Centre and it's reasonable, competitive prices. I was warmly received and made welcome. The resources of the hotel were excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful. A thoroughly satisfactory experience which I shall happily repeat if and when I am in New York again.';5
My husband and I have just returned from a 6 night stay in Riad Kheirredine in Marrakech.  We had looked at tripadvisor reviews before making our decision and we were not disappointed.   I can only describe the Riad as a little bit of paradise hidden away in the maze that is the Medina.    We were collected from the airport by taxi who took us as far as the square. We were then met by 2 staff from the Riad who took our luggage and swiftly navigated the streets and led us to an unassuming door. When we stepped in the Riad was just beautiful. We were made to feel like long lost friends. We arrived at 10.30 am and were greeted with breakfast which was totally unexpected. We then were given a guided tour and finally shown to our room - which was stunning.   Our room had luxury;5
I continue to be pleased with the service and facilities at the Universal Hilton. I have been staying at the hotel since 2007 and they continue to improve their offering. The guest services group and food service staff are really among the best in the country.;5
My husband and I stayed here in October.  The accommodation met all our expectations and more.  Our room was lovely, very clean and great blockout blinds.  The staff were all very friendly and when we asked any questions they went out of their way to offer assistance. Their seafood buffet was well worth the money and their bar area is a great place to sit and relax. The pool area was lovely and they made some great cocktails.  It was a short walk to public transport and right next to Universal Studios and Universal City.  We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our family and friends and would definately stay here again;5
We spent 2 nights here and was very happy with the hotel. Room size was good. Beds very comfortable and staff very friendly and helpful. Shuttle service was very good and plenty of restaurants nearby. We did not eat here but took advantage of their 24 hours cafe a few times for water, drinks etc. Would stay here again.;5
As a Wyndham Rewards member I appreciated being able to check in at 2pm on a Saturday and the 2pm late out. I also really appreciated the upgrade to a corner suite on the second highest floor of the hotel. Great views. The only minor issue is the the beds are a little small as is the bathroom.;5
Location - Directly across from Lincoln Center, a block from Central Park and just north of Columbus Circle, this is a very convenient Upper West Side location.  Staff - friendly and helpful.  Valet/door/bell service is flawless, rooms are clean and desk personnel are efficient (thanks, Michael, for your friendly and helpful check-out service!).  Rooms - king deluxe room was booked.  By NYC standards, very spacious, with nice view of Lincoln Center.  Rooms are a bit warm (could not adjust using room controls), but better than cold in November!  Room was clean and bedding was exceptionally comfortable.  Other - pet friendly, with a very reasonable pet fee (I've paid the same in many small cities).  Read pet policy for limits.  On-site restaurant - Ed's Chowder - was very;5
I stayed at Riad Kheirredine for 4 days just before Christmas. I was traveling alone and it was my first time in Morocco so I had no idea what to expect. I chose the riad from doing Google search and I thought the reviews might be overly generous but I didn't have any other way to judge so I went with it. As I was making arrangements the staff was very helpful in offering airport transportation and assistance with day trips and other needs. When I arrived in Marrekech, I was greeted at the airport exactly as promised and driven to the riad. Once there, Youssef met me at the gate of the Medina with someone to help with my luggage. I was greeted by the hotel staff with mint tea and a hand towels, and realized immediately that I couldn't have made a better choice.  The hotel, and;5
Had the best stay at the ameritana on 54th Street, staff were very kind and approachable especially Jeff, as soon as we entered the hotel to the minute we left he was nothing but pleasant and helpful with tips on where to go, eat and visit! Room was just right for us, plenty of space and the bathroom was perfect shower was huge! We had a beautiful room and the air con was loud but when sleeping I didnât hear it or hear anything from the streets!  Perfect location too! Very central! Perfect stay! 10/10;5
Throughout our accommodations at the Hollywood hotel Pil has been very nice, polite and helpful to all of us at the Hollywood premier healthcare center. Over all we have over 15 rooms here and we all love Pil. He cares for us just like family.  The hotel is really clean, maids are so nice and clean everyday. All of us here feel very safe at the hotel thanks to all the security.   All healthcare workers should come to the Hollywood hotel for a nice stay.;5
I stayed two separate days in one week in two separate rooms. I can't say enough about how clean and beautiful the rooms were. I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond and travel extensively. This has been my absolute favorite hotel this year. The staff is what made the difference. From the front desk, breakfast, housekeeping and concierge this definitely met Hilton standards. I will be back again in August and looking forward to another stay.;5
About 5 years ago, I started taking my student group to the Days Hotel for our annual trip to NYC.  It was a little shabby at the time, and there can still be minor problems with the bathroom fixtures, but I've been back every year, and it gets better and better.  Rooms have been renovated, they now offer discount coupons for breakfast at nearby restaurants, the subway is incredibly convenient (right across the street), and it's within fairly easy walking distance of Central Park.  But mainly, I can't say enough about the people. From the front desk to the doormen, they are efficient, friendly, and unfailingly helpful.  Coral Castillo, who is currently doing group reservations, rocks!  And while I was checking in, with my 12-passenger van out front in the unloading zone, one of;5
Fabulous Hotel, wonderful location and a throwback to a by gone age. At a similar price to the Sherborne on Lexington Avenue we thought weâd give the New Yorker a chance. It really is difficult to directly compare. The rooms are small but more than adequate, the corridors are reminiscent of âThe Shining â. Throw in the Art Deco design. The location is just brilliant. Handy for transport links, midtown attractions and Hellâs Kitchen. The staff where super helpful and sorted out an error with our bill with little fuss. Itâs not a modern hotel but what it lacks in that area it makes up in others. We where right above Nikola Teslaâs rooms which was cool. Definitely the place to stay when we return to NYC.;5
We had seven wonderful nights in this hidden gem in The Medina in Marrakech. The accommodation was luxurious, the food in the restaurant and delivered to your room on request was superb and the staff were wonderful. They catered for our every need, including booking excursions, guiding us to different points in The Medina which is full of sign less alleyways and narrow streets and then coming to us to guide us back to The Riad. Helpfully The Riad gave us a mobile phone with their number programmed in to call for a guide or if we got lost at all. As I said above the food is supberb with a great a la carte evening menu and a wonderful breakfast menu. The accommodation is luxurious and part of it includes a Hamman and massage parlour that I would recommend vsiting and a roof;5
The hotel was excellent. Reception staff were very friendly and very helpful nothing was to much trouble. Room was very clean and comfortable.Would fully recommend The Empire Hotel and perhaps return one day.;5
We stayed 3 nights prior to Thanksgiving and had booked a double room with an optional upgrade to a double/double to allow our daughter (living in NJ) to stay with us for one night. The upgrade wasn't available but Lynn on reception was able to upgrade us to a suite with a view for not too much extra making the overall stay really good value. The hotel was busy throughout our visit but very clean throughout and ideally located for sightseeing and access to  NJ from Penn Station. There was plenty of choice for places to eat within a short walking distance, including the Tik Tok diner located in the Foyer which was reasonably priced and good quality.  Good hotel, I would thoroughly reccomend it.;5
Great rooms with excellent view of Lincoln Center. Central Park was very close by and everywhere else was reachable by the subway across the street. If it had been warmer then I would have tried the rooftop pool. Maybe next time. Friendly and helpful staff, rooms comfortable and well serviced. Bars and restaurants nearby. I really enjoyed this stay;5
I always stay at Los Angeles HYATT. Itâs very convenient, safe, clean & comfy! I was visiting my daughter and our new grand baby who live at least 50 minutes from the airport so flying from Florida to Los Angeles is tiring so I need a good hotel to stay at and relax. The hotel is right next to the airport so I stay there so I can catch my flight on time.;5
We stayed here and really enjoyed it.  A short walk to Universal Studios (albeit uphill for those with mobility issues) and a cheap Uber to Hollywood Boulevard, the Staples Centre etc.  It is clean, tidy and the rooms are a good size and a good place to base yourselves.;5
My granddaughter and I and my husband and I always stay at the Ameritania Hotel in NYC every time we visit the city.  It is very comfortable and the staff is very accommodating.  The location is great, close to Rock Center, Broadway, Radio City Music Hall etc.  we always enjoy our stay there.;5
Great location and amenities (took advantage of the pool and sauna). Room exceeded our expectations.   Exceptional service from Pil & Angelica during check-in. Very helpful ensuring our family was taken care of.  Highly recommend.;5
We were really happy with our stay in New York and notably about the Jane Hotel. We had the bunk bed cabin room 360 and stayed for nights 29/08/14 to 05/09/14.  We knew the room would be tiny but practical and it did not disappoint. We had good nights sleep there and the room was very clean and tidy. The air condition system was a must, as it was about 25-30 degrees even after dusk.  Housekeeping was great and the room was cleaned and sorted daily if wished, nice touch refilling the bottles of water for customers on these occasions.  The TV entertainment we barely used but when we did the service was great and the choice of TV channels was plentiful, same for the sound and image quality.  We liked that the hotel had full high speed Wifi available for free everywhere, including;5
5 minute walk from the metro stop and another 5 minutes to universal. Great location and a great feeling after a long day in the park to know your room is only around the corner. We went for new years eve, and although they were very busy we were checked in and escorted personally to the elevator. Complimentary fruit plate in our room and great view of the park and city walk.;5
Stayed nov 2013 with friends. Loved the hotel. Rooms were small but lovely, clean and perfect for a stay. Bathrooms are tiny but why would you need a big bathroom? Lobby is beautiful and cocktail bar great, only downside is the lobby got freezing with doors opening and closing so they really need to have more doors I think somewhere by reception to stop the draft coming through. Location great right by Lincoln centre and also walking distance to Central Park and Columbus circle. Roof top bar was fun and lively with great views! Would definitely go back;5
"Yes, the bathroom is tiny (but stylishly updated) and our room was charming, newly painted and decorated, and just right for a stay with our granddaughters in NYC.  They were thrilled with the ""New York"" feel of the lobby and our room.  We all liked the Upper Westside location---a nice respite---but just a quick subway ride away---from the hot bustle of mid and downtown.  Great for access to Lincoln Center, the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park and The Met. The pool was perfect for cooling off during the heatwave.  Our air conditioner needed updating-- a bit old and chugging away---but we were there during the worst of heat waves. Staff was all friendly and could not have been more helpful. We would definitely stay here again.";5
The Riad is exceptional, the staff are excellent and nothing was ever any trouble. The room (Ambra) was a good size, with a comfortable bed and a nice bathroom. The breakfast was perfect, but really each and everyone of the staff make it the most pleasurable and family like place.   We were given a local mobile phone to use in case we got lost or needed help, they arranged pick up and drop off at the airport with a porter to transfer luggage from and to the car. Always gave us a bottle of water to carry when going out, told us that laundry was included and even got us Kaab el Ghazal (Cornes de Gazelle) cookies to take back to London. We can't recommend the staff and the ambience of the Riad enough.   Word of advice - make sure you know your way to and from the Riad to the Jemaa;5
Where to start?  The location: AWESOME.  Close to Columbus Circle and Central Park and so easy to get everyone that we went over the weekend.  The hotel: When you walk in, you immediately feel the ambiance.  Apparently Gossip Girl is regularly filmed at the hotel.  The rooftop bar is really nice, and one of the decks is right by the Empire Hotel sign.  The service: When we checked in, Nicole Agnello took good care of us with setting up the rooms, getting our valet parking set up and getting us a late check-out.  She pointed us to the concierge where Yuri managed to find us a last-minute dinner reservation for eight people on a Saturday night.  There were a few times when we had to call down to the front desk for various items (i.e. iron, safety pins, etc.).  They were always;5
Great location, good food, comfortable room- and the staff made my day by providing parking for a few extra hours at no cost!  Thank you to the head bellman with the Reindeer Sweater!  Close enough to walk to the park!;5
All of my stays at The New Yorker Hotel have been great experiences. I typically visit the hotel a few times a month. The staff members are pleasant and quite helpful. The guest rooms are always clean and inviting. The overall atmosphere in and around the hotel is lively and fun. Visit The New Yorker Hotel ... you won't be disappointed!;5
Nice hotel to meet your basic lodging needs on the edge of Central Park. Considering the guest reviews, we were pleasantly surprised at the clean room, comfy beds and very friendly staff.  We look forward to coming back soon.;5
We chose this hotel to be close to Lincoln Center and it was perfect!  We were also within 2 blocks of Central Park and walking distance or a short bus ride to Times Square!  We will definitely return to Hotel Empire for this event next year!;5
4th time to New York City, first time at the Empire. The location was perfect for me. Absolutely loved the city view which included Lincoln Centre.  I am coming back to stay here again with my family in a larger room in February - I expect they will really enjoy the hotel as well.;5
We arrived Friday night and were very impressed with the service.  Jerry checked us into our room very quickly and was very helpful in helping us find cool things to see over the weekend.  I would highly recommend this place because of the beautiful rooms and views, and also the staff;5
Stayed five nights, amazing hotel with real old time charm to it. Had a suite on 38th floor with front view of Empire State building....fabulous. Rooms were clean and modern, cleaned daily and comfortable. Bottled water and canned drinks complimentary. Diner and restaurant attached to hotel. Had a fantastic time.;5
Nicole and Beatriz are very friendly, very helpful and very funny. Nicole went out of her way to help us extend our stay and Beatriz translated every of the way. Pool was beautiful and room was comfortable. Thumbs up!;5
I stayed here for one night,but I loved it! It is close to everything in Hollywood. It is within walking distance to restaurants and the Metro Red Line if you would like to explore the city. Our room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I will be staying here again!!;5
We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Our room was on the 23rd floor. We were given a little fun and funky multi-room suite. We had a dinning/sitting area with a desk and open views down and over the Hudson. There was an apart bedroom with 2 double beds. There was a bathroom and an apart wc. Everything was clean and kept neat, that's important.  Yes, things were a little dated here and there - but that is exactly what we love - a place where you can tell that people have felt that they could relax and live in.  Surf and you will find that there is some really cool history in this building as well.  The staff was always friendly and always gave us a smile when we came in.;5
I have always liked the hotel because of it's location, convenient to Columbus Circle, Lincoln center, easy access to subways, and close to good restaurants. Their staff has always been very helpful. If there has been any negative it has been the smaller size of the rooms. This time we stayed in a great room, much larger than we had stayed in before and a great value for the money relative to other hotels in the same area. Great stay and quite comfortable.;5
We had the most wonderful time while staying at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City.  The property is very clean, and the concierge agent, Luis, was extremely helpful.  I highly recommend staying here, and, yes, it is walking distance to Universal Studios Hollywood.;5
Look no further if you are looking for somewhere to stay in Marrakech!!  From the moment you are met at the airport to arriving at the Riad, your every need is catered for.  The attention to detail for a comfortable and enjoyable stay is paramount to the staff led by Yajaira and Elena.  We took the option of having our first meal at the Riad.  It was a delicious feast of Moroccan cuisine.  We had two further meals which were also fantastic.  There is an abundance of restaurants to delight any palette, information of which is on the literature the Riad give you.  We stayed in the Ambra room.  It was comfortable and spacious with a seating area ideal for having afternoon refreshments, which were free and came with delicious biscuits or olives if having alcohol. As mentioned in;5
We went to New York for my sister's birthday, and the hotel staff couldn't have done more. They upgraded us, sent up a bottle of fizz and generally treated us beautifully. Our room was fabulous, with an amazing view of the Metropolitan. We only had to cross the road to the opera, which was another bonus. We left with great memories and wouldn't hesitate to return.;5
Moderate price for a Great Hotel that seemed worth well more. Rooms were big for NYC standards. Clean, friendly, location was perfect for us and our travels all over Manhattan. I would highly recommend.;5
Good location in the West Village. Very safe walking neighborhood. Close to subway and next to the Hudson River Park. The Jane has bicycles available on an first come, first served basis. My room and the bathroom were very clean. Good pillows! Friendly and helpful staff. Good value at $150 per night.;5
Would like to say what a professional happy helpful the coloured girl was on the front desk on Saturday around 1230 hrs sorry canât remember her name but she was very helpful and professional many thanks;5
Prior to arriving at the hotel, I received a reminder call from the hotel staff Lucas regarding my credit card declining, and asking about my approximate time of arrival (which was in about half an hour). Lucas was very pleasant on the phone. When we got to the check in desk, there was only one guy working and about 3 people in line. Later on another lady came out to help but it took a long time before she stopped staring at her screen (could be logging on the computer, I'm not sure). For only 3 people in line it took a while waiting to check in. Finally the lady called us over. She checked my ID and proceeded to authorize my credit card. Her credit card machine was having issues and she asked the other guy to use his machine. She kept my ID and I had to ask for it back, which;5
"We were on a short trip to NYC and this hotel location was the best: next to Colbert's (we went to the show) very close to all NYC ""attractions"" as Central Park, Rockefeller Center, MoMA, Times Square and so on. The rooms were very comfortable, the staff was very kind (we asked for a late checkout and they extended our stay until 2pm (checkout is at noon.) We'll be coming back!";5
Great location for midtown,chelsea and the subway downtown  The lobby is spacious and cool,  the staff are friendly and helpful  We were upgraded to the Muhammad Ali room  by Muhammad on the desk  We loved it âï¸thank you  Lots of cool bars in the area and delis for coffee and things to eat  Nice walk up 8th to the times square area or along 34th Street to the empire state building and 5th avenue Our third trip to new York we stayed at the Roosevelt twice in the past which is also a great place But next time it's the new Yorker;5
Well what can I say Pil was the man @ the front desk, helped me out greatly with excellent customer service skills and great knowledge of area. Was a great stay and no hassle. Will stay again. Beautiful location near all;5
I'm mad about this place. I'll recommend it to all friends & family who visit NYC. The rooms are not huge (tho most of the glam hotels have small rooms) but so many luxury touches. Bigelow lotion. Slippers & a robe. Flat screen tv. Cafe Gitane downstairs offers very yummy food with a number of Veggie options. Service in the hotel is attentive. Plus the hotel is a few blocks from the Highland.   I never write reviews. Many for this hotel were positive but I still had to add my voice. It was recommended by a friend who's taste I respect & who is pickier than me.;5
The hotel is located in a great location in Manhattan. Subways are on the block. Easy access to just about any attraction that NYC has to offer. Spacious lobby. Restaurant has the old-time diner's charm, very family friendly. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Room rates are decent for such a great location. Make sure you book it on the hotels' webiste or with it's staff to get better rates. Third-party platforms can be a rip-off. I booked from reservations.com first. It hid the hurrendous surcharges. I cancelled it at a cost, but booked again directly from the hotel's website, got assistance from the hotel staff who were super helpful and friendly. In the end, I save money as compared with the louse reservations.com.;5
While this hotel is a little older, it is clean, comfy, and updated as much as possible.  The doormen and bell captains were fantastic.  So much better than staying at the large chains.  The location was absolutely perfect.  Had I realized that Stephen Colbert was literally around the corner, I would have tried to get tickets.;5
The hotel was very conveniently located to Penn Station, with a short walk to the theatre district.  The room was clean and sufficient for our needs.  Staff and security were excellent.  The adjourning Tick Tock Diner was a great place for breakfast and late night dining.;5
Jeffery and the team at Ameritania were fantastic. I would come back again and again for business or pleasure. Thank you Jeffrey and the rest of the team.  We arrived and asked for a bigger room and they accommodated and there was a summer special as well as an inexpensive car service to JFK.;5
On my Pacific Coast vacation with my 2 teen boys (16 and 17), we drove from LV to LA. I had a lot of free nights with Hilton (up to category 7 hotels) and was looking for a very nice hotel to stay. I passed on Beverley Hilton as it did not have rooms with 2 beds. I settled on Hilton Universal City, and I was very glad that I did.  The staff was extremely courteous and friendly during our check in and remained so for our entire stay. When we got into our room, the room was smokey and the staff found out another room with the same view (hills and the Universal studios). They ensured that I was able to change my myWay Hilton preferences to get free internet during my stay. I was welcomed with a place of fruits which was delightful. The front desk staff, Robin was very helpful in;5
The Empire Hotel treated us like family for the 10 days we were there.  They gave us a beautiful corner room overlooking Broadway and Lincoln Center.  The Room layout was perfect for times when I wanted to sleep while my husband got up to work during the very early hours before 4am. The hotel staff when above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.;5
Just got back from a quick 2 night stay at the Ameritiana. We arrived at 4pm on Monday and were quickly checked in, we were on the top floor in room 1215, the bed was King size and one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The shower was amazing and for us they are the 2 most important things ! Room size was perfect for the 2 of us, and i loked there was a seperate small wardrobe and safe for passports etc. We had breakfast in the hotel on the 2nd day, it was $18 plus tax each and was great, I would definately reccomend the waffles and Turkey Bacon ! On check out Jeff was fab, he helped us with holding our bags and getting in our car to the airport at a busy time in the hotel, all the concierge were very freindly and helpful. Hotel was in a great position for everything,;5
It has the best location in NYC - l have stayed there over ten times and recommended to friends and family and we all met there and had a great stay. I never had breakfast there but my friends said it was great. The staff is always helpful and there if you need anything. The doormen are lovely and helpful to for taxis etc... you wonât be disappointed!;5
I enjoyed the Starbucks coffee bar and convenient early AM shuttle to the airport.  Room was surprisingly quiet and affordable.  The shuttle to the airport is also a valuable amenity.  I would stay here again!;5
We had an amazing stay! The concierge mourad litrally made our stay he was great he helped us out so much with advise about where too go and what too do and so friendly so a huge thank you so much overall i would highly reccomend the hotel was clean tidy and staff were friendly and helpful;5
Excellent location short walk to universal   Service and hotel were excellent. I would recommend this hotel . They have a nice pool, bar and restaurant on site. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable.;5
Arrived early after a 14 hour flight and they accommodated early check in as requested with original booking. Beds super comfortable, rooms are spacious and clean. Located within walking distance to Universal Studios and City which has numerous dining options. Would highly recommend this hotel.;5
The  Customer service was amazing. The door a man were incredible and so   The customer service was amazing. The door men were so friendly and helpful. The maid service was great. Location of the hotel is ideal. You are close enough to walk to everything but far enough away to have peace and quiet at night.;5
The Hilton shuttle to Universal Studios was a pleasure all day long. Top service, rooms, pool and breakfast cafe. Parking fees were much too high but we really enjoyed the hotel. Staff was professional and courteous.;5
We arrived early and had no problem checking our bags while we toured the city. Rooms were clean and quiet. Location of hotel was ideal for using the subway to get to any part of New York city.;5
i go to NYC often for opera - 5 nights in city and 3 operas. As a consequence I've stayed in various hotels within walking distance. I've been meaning to stay at the Empire for awhile and I don't think I'll be staying anywhere else for opera visits for two reasons. Location, location, location. You get out of the opera after 11 PM, stop at PJ Clarke for a bite, walk next door for a nightcap and take the elevator to your room. Nothing could be simpler. And the second reason, the staff. Everyone from doormen to front desk to concierge to barmen to housekeeping were friendly, helpful and just plain nice. When we were checking out someone was having a fit at the desk but the staff person was being friendly even though the guy was having none of it. So probably not a good review from;5
Everything we wanted and more! Our stay was fabulous from start to finish. The staff was friendly upon checking in and was helpful at all times of day and night. We will definitely be staying here again!;5
The New Yorker Wyndham Hotel is a wonderful place to stay. Entering NYC is located steps from Penn Station. Staff are great in attending to any of your needs. You are stepping into history with the hotel. Rooms are laid out from an overnight stay for one or enjoyment of a suite. The room is clean and housekeeping maintains your room in a perfect condition.;5
An excellent Hotel to stay in. Location was perfect for us. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent, however people were queuing from all angles. We would recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family.;5
"Stayed at the Hilton Universal during new years eve weekend. If you're a HH member, you are kindly greeted when you arrive. That's what I expect from Hilton properties. I was given a voucher for a free Peet's coffee/tea and two bottled waters for silver status. It's these little things that makes you feel special. Every Hilton worker I encountered treated me as an ""A-lister"". Rooms are modern and clean. The ease of walking across the street using the pedestrian bridge or crosswalk was ideal to get to citywalk shops/restaurants or even to Universal theme park. It's about a $10 lyft ride from Bob Hope Airprot, aKa Burbank. What more do you need for a quick getaway?";5
We recently had the pleasure of staying at Riad Kheirredine for 4 nights, and were nothing less than blown away by the experience we received. The location was ideal, the room - perfectly-sized, and the atmosphere was a refreshing refuge from the madness of the souks. We could not fault the service provided and was continuously staggered by the attitude, warmth and helpfulness of all the staff we met during our stay.   As well the spa and the Dinner were amazing.   We could not fault a single part of our stay at Riad Kheirredine and would highly recommend it to anyone searching for a 5-star oasis in the heart of this truly fascinating city!;5
Great experience!! Location is excellent!!! You have central park one block, less than a block a metro station!!  The service excellent!! Confortable beds and rooms!! Very safe to walk the streets at any time!!;5
"We had a great experience at Ameritania Hotel last week. The location is amazing, just a couple blocks away from Central Park and Times Square, but yet, far enough from the crowd. Our bedroom was very confortable, way bigger than the NY hotels average; towels and sheets were new and soft. The staff was friendly and helpfull, and the check in/check out process were very fast and simple. Highly recommend it!";5
Hotel was clean, in a great location and walkable to Universal.   Staff was wonderful from checkin to housekeeping. Maximiliano at the lobby bar was very kind, friendly and went above/beyond if I was in there for lunch or just to grab a coffee before my flight. Great all around.;5
Loved my stay at this hotel and when I go back to NYC I'm staying here again. The price isn't bad and of all the hotels I've stayed in this is by far the best one. The rooms are decent size, especially for New York City. Great location!;5
This hotel does exactly what it says it will.   It is a comfortable, safe and convenient hotel opposite MSG and a 5 min walk from Time Square.   We stayed 5 nights. We got clean sheets every day, took five mins to check in and out. Room is quite small but is completely managable. Good shower and bathroom.   Decor is a little dated, but is in keeping with overall age of the hotel. Also has a good gym.   Perfect for a couple of visitying NYC.;5
Gabriel, the Food and Beverage Manager, has been amazing to deal with and deserves a medal!  I have been trying to arrange a venue in NYC for a party of 4 to attend for New Yearâs Eve over the last couple of months and one of our ânarrowed down choicesâ has been The Empire Hotel. Trying to plan and book things to do on a holiday when we are coming from Australia has not proven easy although with Gabrielâs polite nature and prompt responses to my (many) emails, it has made what was becoming an impossible process, achievable! Many other venues have fired off generic, impersonal replies that often did not cover the questions I was seeking answers to and Gabrielâs swift responses and genuine offering of information I needed quickly made The Empire Hotel a major contender for our;5
We stayed at the hotel for three nights and have to say the customer service was amazing,the hotel atmosphere is very relaxing and the rooms are very well equipped (on the small side) but comfortable and decor retro and up to date,Denise the receptionist was very helpful and got our rooms ready ahead of check in,Javier the bartender was also very pleasant making you feel welcome and had plenty chat,The concierge Jeff couldn't have done enough for us from advising us on where to go,restaurants,shows to see and booked our transfer back to the airport I have never received service like it he was absolutely amazing 6*, I would recommend this hotel 100% and would definitely stay here again;5
Was a quick get away for us as a family with 3 kids. Neat and tidy rooms, awesome location 5 mins walking to universal studios, universal city, where you can do shopping, eating outlets. I want to say special thanks to a person from reception Lucas, who helped us with our check in process and room arrangements.;5
The whole experience was perfect.  My room was very comfortable and very clean, which is the single most important aspect to a hotel stay.  Nailed it!  The front desk staff were extremely friendly and courteous.  Bobby checked me in quickly (good thing because I arrived very late) and the following morning Nicole, Gisel and Beatriz helped me out with everything I needed the following morning.  I ended up working from their lobby for most of the day, so I got to hear them interact with customers all day.  I was extremely impressed with their professionalism all day.  Free breakfast was unexpected and a very nice touch.  I would be delighted to stay here again.;5
This hotel is located in the heart of New York.  It has easy access to anything a visitor could want.  It is also a beautiful place to stay - very clean with a great staff.;5
What an amazing hotel! Couldn't do enough for you! Room always clean! Coffee and water complementary every morning, the receptionist were brilliant we wanted a Chinese one night and they googled the nearest one for us and rang them for us! The doormen were fantastic always a warm welcome especially Jeff! What a guy! Couldn't fault anything about this hotel well definitely be back! Thankyou!!;5
We had a great time at Ameritania. We started it having a reservation at Amsterdam court but Expedia overbooked so they sent us here and the staff was incredible. Brad at the front desk, Jeff helped us a ton leaving today. The rooms were comfortable and mostly just so happy with the staff. Thank you!;5
We stayed at the ameritania during our whole stay. On arrival we was very impressed with the appreance of the hotel and it's location from the subway and times square and central park. I would highly recommend anyone thinking of visiting new york to stay here. The beds were extremely comfortable and bathrooms immaculate. The hotel lobby and general areas are very clean and very well presented. The breakfast is a good deal too at $10 a day each but is a buffet style and more than great to get your day started. Would definitely recommend for everyone to stay here.;5
This was my first time staying at the Empire  Hotel and loved it. Convenient location, good amenities. Gabriel at the front desk was the man - facilitated everything to make it an awesome trip for me. Would definitely go back next time I'm in town.;5
Well, first time in this city and hotel. the hotel is perfectly located, short walk to Times square, has madison arena next door so usually some big names on. Red hot chilli peppers when we were there and Billy Joel week after.Short walk to Times Square. Only had food once in the restaurant inside hotel, as there was that many to go to but the one time we did it was very good. Bar a little expensive. Paid over $8.00 for a stella but then again this is New York. Staff are all friendly and helpfull  and I would like to say a big Thank you to Mohamed who upgraded our room to one with a city view at no extra. This guy couldn't do enough to make sure were were happy. Even phoned our room as soon as we were in just to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. If we return to New;5
Perfect location for universal studios. Very nice hotel, loved the view,and delicious hot chocolate in the dining / bar area.  Very comfortable rooms.walking distance to a grocery store.Very helpful staff.;5
We stayed for one night after an exhausting flight. The place is absolutely quite!!! You canât hear any flight noise, although the hotel is literally inside the airport. Very clean, trendy, with a great full menu bar-restaurant. The buffet breakfast is amazing (a bit expensive, but worth it);5
A return visit so clearly we like this hotel! We arrived  early, expecting to be able to leave our baggage whilst we explored,  but amazingly our room was ready 3 hours early! Fantastic bonus! View from our 9th floor room was not much to shout about but certainly let plenty of sunlight in.  Terriic large shower and plenty of towels. If you've never stayed here before, the sound on the air con may seem loud - but you really do get used to it. Complemintary teas and coffees / snacks every day were an unexpected bonus too. Location is great for Central Park and Times Square with verything else a very easy Subway ride away. Geoff and all the guys on the door were there normal great selves - if you need or want to know anything, just ask them! In summary, a great, non chain  place to;5
We enjoyed our stay here at the Hollywood Hotel thanks to Nicole and Beatriz. They were both very kind and cared for us through-out our stay. They helped us get a room with a shower and we were very grateful for that. Thank you!;5
Stayed at the Empire for a couple nights back in Jan (14').  Notes-  -Nick who checked us in was extremely helpful.  It was later on a Sunday night and we were HUNGRY.  He knew quite a few spots that served late and hooked us up.  -Maybe ask for a room that views Lincoln Center  -The lobby bar is sweet, has a very classic Hollywood vibe.  The bartender was a true gentleman.  I wanted a Manhattan to take up to the room.  He poured it into a rocks glass and gave me an up glass with a cherry for when I got to the room.  And when I poured it, it was to the rim.  Well done.  -Didn't make it to the Chowder House (you can access it from inside the hotel) but it looks solid.  Nice bar for those of us who only eat at the bar.  -Had a great meal at The Smith across the way.  New American;5
My husband and I used to live in NYC and we now travel back frequently for my medical check-ups. For the past 2 visits, we stayed at the New Yorker. It's a  beautiful old hotel, rich in history, relatively low in price and conveniently located next door to Penn Station. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel , a fact that we greatly appreciated this last visit, when the temperature dropped to the teens and we didn't want to go outside. The best part of the hotel is the staff- everyone from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping staff are friendly, respectful and responsive.;5
I've been staying here since 2095. The staff is welcoming  The rooms are big The food is great And the bar is fun! And so on and so on andso on and so on and so on and so on andso on and so on andso on and so on andso on and so on andso on and so on;5
We were greeted early in the morning by a very helpful Pil. He helped us get all settled in after a 12 hour trip and gave us all the best tips for having a great time around LA.    Great pool, sauna and other installations.;5
I spent a couple of days at this hotel and was very pleased with the modern rooms that were comfortable.  Most of all I was extremely pleased with the front desk and how helpful the front desk manager Gisel was.  She was very knowledgeable of the area and gave great advise on sights and things to do.  She was very attentive and had great recommendations for dining.;5
Convenient location: Right next to Madison SQ garden and a subway stop. Walk a little bit more and thereâs Times Square! Nice view: I stayed on the 22nd floor and I was able to see The Empire State Building!  One night was a little under $170 (which is a steal for its location), but they allowed us to check in 2 hours earlier than the check in time so that was awesome ðð»;5
clean, well maintained, friendly staff, and the FREE breakfast with the Omlete bar was amazing!  I would stay there again in a heart beat.  Far exceeded my expectations.  Breakfast having the staff especially Sonia and Oralia with there upbeat friendly service oriented attitudes made breakfast time every morning be one of the highlights of our day.  Thank You!!!  Jeffree Franscisco Hawk;5
"Our room was small, but entirely adequate for our needs. Very clean, it appeared to be recently painted, etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was very nice to be in the excitement of NYC and the activity of 8 th Ave; but even nicer to step inside the New Yorker to relax and have a good meal. And a good night's sleep.";5
The New Yorker is an amazing property. It is centrally located and walking distance to Time Square, Macy's, Empire State Building, etc.  If you love historic hotels then you will.love this one. The room was a bit small, but very comfortable. The shower was amazing with great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The bed was extremely comfortable also.  The staff was fantastic also. For my birthday they upgraded us to a room with a view of the Empire State Building and had a bottle of wine brought to the room.   I look forward to returning next year.;5
I'm in transition and have been staying at The Empire a few nights  week for the past month and a half. The hotel is very clean and the service is prompt and courteous. The from desk is vey helpful and the staff goes out of their way for the comfort and well being of their guests. The hotel is right in the heart of the city and that being said, the rooms are quite quiet. A few times my room overlooked Lincoln Center and one time I had a back room with no view. The decor is a little on the trendy side with Satin Drapes and Italian bedding. All very tasteful. As far as NYC hotels go, the rooms were also fairly spacious. I have not checked out the restaurants at the hotel although they have a great reputation and I will check them out in the upcoming weeks.;5
I recently stayed there and the service was excellent. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful! Clean, spacious, great view! Would definitely stay there again and recommend it highly!;5
Service level is five star, especially Rome at the front desk, but everyone, from the bell desk to the valet to the wait staff were simply outstanding.  Room was large and comfortable, with a great view of Universal and Hogwarts (Harry Potter).  Food was excellent with the one exception of noodle dish that was just okay.  Closest hotel to Universal and City Walk.  If you're going to Universal, this is the place to stay.;5
We had a room on the 16th floor. Rooms are nice size, very clean. Friendly staff. Breakfast buffet is great.   Location is great as the hotel is located across from Universal Studios.  Shuttle provided to the park complimentary.  No need to fuss with parking at the theme park.;5
Great hotel, comfortable beds, amazing upgraded balcony room, breakfast was a bit early for us but we forced our way to the kitchen and it was worth it. Recommend paying for remodeled balcony room. Thank you to Pil for being extra accommodating, the extra pillows and blankets were a blessing. Will return.;5
The location was perfect. We could walk from the train station and had easy access to subways. The dÃ©cor of the hotel is stunning and our room was quiet and beautiful. This will always be our first choice hotel in NYC.;5
This hotel provides excellent service. Everyone working is super friendly and helpful. No request was too troublesome. They were able to help us get dinner reservations and recommend places to see and try. The facility is nice in the sense everything is very clean and there is not too many guests therefore the atmosphere is rather serene. My wife and I were treated to free snacks and food on our arrival and throughout the stay there was no issues getting water, tea, orange juice and coffee provided all in the room rate. The breakfast was rather complete and it was all included in our hotel cost. Every morning we got a variety of pastries, fruits, breads, breakfast meat and eggs made to order. We made it a point to book a two hour Royal Spa treatment which is highly recommended.;5
This hotel is steps away from The Met.  It is very pleasant and convenient to stay overnight when we attend an opera performance.  The staff is always very helpful and accommodating.  Our only problem on this particular stay was that the AC did not work.  This was not fixed after several calls to the front desk (even though they said the electrician was coming to look into it, no one actually did.)  It was particularly difficult to sleep in an overly warm room.;5
We were welcomed at the door as we pulled up very easily to the valet parking area. Check in was quick and friendly.  We had complimentary food at the bar and ordered delicious margaritas. Check out was simple, no surprise charges, friendly personnel. The room was clean, beds were comfortable, will definitely return.;5
Perfectly located Hotel. Service was really friendly and professional. Five minute drive to Griffith Observatory, 2 to Hollywood Blvd, 10 to L.A. Museum of History. Half hour to Dodgers Stadium! Easy parking. Super comfy beds!!! Great gym. Perfect hotel to return to after a long day of sightseeing!;5
When first getting to the hotel, I knew I was a few hours before checkin time but they pre checked me in to save time when checkin time actually came around. They then held my bags so I could begin exploring the city. After getting to my room we discovered the shower head was broken and spraying water all over. We spoke with a manager who was very nice and upgraded us to an executive room. The executive room was great! Much more room to move around, updated, and a view of the Empire State Building! We had a great time and all the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful.;5
We came into Penn Station on the train and only had an overnight layover.  We opted for the New Yorker hotel because of it's proximity to Penn Station as our train left early the next morning.  The hotel is conveniently located about 1 1/2 blocks from Penn Station.  When we entered the hotel, the staff was very friendly, welcoming, and willing to help with whatever we might need.  The room was clean, well supplied, and the view from the balcony was amazing.;5
There truly aren't words to put into how wonderful our stay was at Riad Kheirredine. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty - airport pickup, moroccan tea & treats, a personalized tour of the place with recommendations for throughout the city, offers to walk us wherever we needed to go, planning excursions, etc.! They made everything so easy and the quality of the amenities, food, everything was unbelievable.  Aside from everything listed above, what truly made our experience here was the staff. They are some of the most hospitable, friendly, and kind humans we've ever met. They were so much fun to talk to and be around during our stay.   Would recommend this place over and over again to anyone considering coming to Marrakech.;5
All the family were made to feel special including two young children, who were staying in a hotel for the first time. Restaurant staff went out of their way to help and ensure we were all happy.  Great location.  We will certainly return.;5
I went to NYC in the las september, and what I have to say about this hotel is: If you wanna stay in a charming, confortable, very clean, with a very good localization, and with good rates, it's perfect! So, you're gonna stay in front of Central Park, wich is great! There is a subway station very close to the hotel, it's about 10 minutes from Times Square! The staff is friendly and helpfull! Every time you get back to your room IT'S GONNA BE CLEAN!! There is  a Cafe(Lâexquisitus CafÃ©), right over the corner, that is a very nice place to have your breakfast, IT IS DELICIOUS!!!  It was the best trip of my life, and this hotel was part of it!!! I hope to inspire you that is looking for some help to choose a hotel in a city like New York.   Regards,   Alex;5
This is a very convenient hotel if you have an early flight to catch at the airport.  I really liked the accommodations since they reconditioned the place from when it was a Raddison.  Would highly recommend this location if you have a flight out of LAX.;5
"We absolutely loved our stay at the Hollywood Hotel! I took my daughter to see her first concert at the Greek Theatre, so we made a ""Hollywood weekend"" of it all. This hotel was perfect for us. Our room was newly renovated in classic Hollywood decor. The pool was inviting and relaxing. When I posted pictures of our trip online, friends commented on how ""glamorous"" everything looked. And our buffet breakfast was gourmet and delicious. Our concert was even on the same street, Vermont Avenue, which made for a quick drive back to the hotel after the show.  We will definitely recommend this place to our friends & we plan to stay here again.";5
It is a new hotel and although I usually expect little of airport hotels, this one really is different in that the staff understand the traveler's needs.  The lobby is bright and open and easy to navigate and find the front desk. Check-in is rapid - enough staff at all times to move you through quickly. Check-out was a breeze, the front desk person emailed the bill, as well as brought an invoice to me while I was boarding the shuttle - which is steps away from the front desk. How cool is that!  Lobby has an extensive grab-n-go and a restaurant that opens for breakfast at 5:30AM -a full hour earlier than most airport hotels. Shuttle is continuous - about every ten minutes, yet this hotel is the closest to the airport so it is possible to actually walk to the terminals.  Rooms are;5
After a long 15 hour flight, we arrived early to our hotel, and were happy to pay an early check in fee, but Beatrix happily waved the fee for us, which was so appreciated. The hotel was lovely and clean, and the facilities were all up to date. The pool was a lovely way to relax after a long day.  The rooms were excellent, and having a fridge and microwave was very handy. Some kind of blockage may be required under the doors, as especially early in the mornings, the doors slamming from people leaving their rooms was quite loud and disrupting. A really excellent hotel, super close to the Metro line (7 day pass was only $25), which took you to all main tourist locations.  Will definitely recommend this hotel in the future, thanks again!;5
Totally exceeded expectations .. Manhattan was a stop in our travels with our large family.  I searched high and low then decided on the New Yorker.  We just wanted a clean spot to lay our heads ... It was way more! The room was updated with vintage charm.  .. Marble in the bathroom with the flare of Art Deco and modern cleanliness.  The beds were very lux and comfy.  The view .. Amazing!! The location and convenience are remarkable! Walking distance to many major tourist spots .. Madison Square Garden, MoMa, Times Square,  Rockefeller Center, Broadway shows and so much more! Oh and the Tick Tock dinner .. We are there every morning! They were great, made feeding a family of SEVEN a breeze!    If you are on the fence .. Just book it!;5
this hotel was super fun.  very new york style. this hotel has the best bell hop mourad!  he was very helpful and was easy to talk to!  it was also very  cool having this hotel right there in time square!;5
Our trip came me with a few bumps along the way but the late night operator went above and beyond to ensure our stay without a hitch. She was incredible and even comped our breakfast after both my husbandâs and my own wallet was stolen out of my purse at universal studios. She followed up with us which made a big impression and showed the hotel truly cares about itâs guests! Weâll DEFINITELY be returning. Thank you Asusena!;5
Fantastic Location. Nice rooms. Free shuttle to Universal Studios. You can also take a paid shuttle ($29) from LAX to avoid the $88 taxi bill. You could also take the metro.   A bit expensive to park. Also they have me breakfast vouchers for my gold status but that was for continental breakfast only and I had to pay $10 pp to upgrade to full breakfast.   Nice view if you get a high floor.;5
Terrific stay. Checked in for a conference and added some extra nights afterwards. We found the hotel to be very clean and staff friendly and helpful throughout. In particular the front desk staff were excellent (thank you Aimee and Linda for your great service). Our room was very clean and housekeeping did a terrific job every time they were in. We found the Peet's Coffee outlet to be handy for a bagel or fruit yogurt parfait in the morning (without having to go the the restaurant for breakfast). That said, they did tend to run out of things and didn't seem keen to re-stock, so don't expect too much if you're planning a late breakfast. Pool area was clean and enjoyable too.;5
Beautiful. Staff was very friendly, attentive, and worked hard to serve. They've got it right for customer service. The hotel is clean, rooms spacious.  Stay here with confidence. Our interactions with the front desk, the concierge, the universal studios tours concierge, Chris, were all at their absolute best.;5
The hotel is near Central Park and is a perfect location to explore the city. We arrived in the evening and were excited to check out the roof top lounge. It did not disappoint! the service was very good and the view was awesome. our room was small , which is typical for the city, but it was clean and appears to have been updated in recent years.  Tommy the doorman was very helpful whenever I needed a recommendation for a restaurant or specific site to check out.  Always felt he gave individual service.  He is a total gem for the hotel.;5
The hotel is clean and well maintained. The room we were allocated was spacious and the beds extremely comfortable. The level of customer service we received was beyond exemplary particular accolade for Nicole on the front desk who made us feel welcome from the second we arrived. She was extremely patient and helpful in spite of the numerous enquiries we had. All in all a fantastic stay and would recommend to all.;5
I usually write a combined review with my husband, but on this occasion I felt compelled to write one each!   As the number one rated accommodation in Marrakech, we had high expectations. What we did not expect was to be even more blown away by the hospitality received.  Upon arrival from a very early morning flight from London, we were greeted with a complimentary feast. Freshly squeezed orange, coffees & teas, fresh pastries, eggs cooked any way, cheese, hot food selection, cakesâ¦ we were set up for the day! Over our 4 day stay, this is how we started the day - needless to say, by the end of our trip, our clothes were a bit tighter than when we arrived!   The welcome was very personal and any safety concerns were immediately put to ease as we were given a mobile phone to use;5
We have spent four nights at the Empire. We can definitely recommend it. Just in front of the wonderful Lincoln Center and its metro station on Line 1 and 2, with easy access to Manhattan Uptown and Downtown. Next to Central Park, several restaurants and bars in the area, plus the hotel rooftop bar. Unfortunately the swimming pool on the top opens only in summer. A special mention for PASQUALE at the reception, who welcomed us and made every effort to make us enjoy our stay.;5
Super location for Metropolitan Opera House, Central Park and easy walk to main shopping. Larger than average room size for NY. The Smith & PJ Clarke are great eating venues nearby. Checkout Blue Dog for breakfast  a short walk away.;5
I return to this hotel every year for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel like an honored guest.  Two in particular, Mohammed and Neida are so wonderful with their help to make sure my stay is always superb.   I had to ask for a few things to be brought to the room.  There was absolutely no wait....a staff member showed up almost immediately.  When I thought a lightbulb had blown out, an electrician arrived within minutes.  He checked the fixture, and then discovered I had inadvertently pulled out the plug. Neida and Mohammed both welcomed me with their cheerful manner, and did everything possible to accommodate my needs during my stay. They made recommendations for their own restaurants in the hotel, and were ready to answer my;5
After staying at the Holiday Inn at arrival in LA, we wanted a nicer place for our outbound stay. The Hyatt was not much more expensive and far better value. Freshly renovated, quiet, walkable to airport if you want to (made it easy to get back to after I returned my rental car the night before departure and took the shuttle to the airport), pleasant staff. All in all a good stay. The parking was a little confusing - I think if you are keeping a car there you enter in the back. Because I was just dropping my bags, I went to valet in the front (after an extra trip around the block while I figured the situation out) and they gave me a 20 minute window to leave the car, register and come back for the car. We ate in the bar area and the meal was good. Pool looked nice but we didn't;5
Great place to stay, especially if you need a place for a few hours in between flights. Lots of food options for all ages, allergies and likes/dislikes. Strict Covid protocol in place for checkin and the food options are available 24-hours a day.;5
I recently stayed at the Empire Hotel for 10 + days.. The front desk staff is so amazing ... especially Zunachy and Pasquale! They were so friendly and helpful to me . The location of this hotel is great, surrounded by many great restaurants and Lincoln Center. It is close to the bus line of for a quick trip to the east side.;5
I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. I appreciate the helpful and friendly staff, the complimentary shuttle to Universal Studios and the CityWalk, the clean and comfortable guest room, the fairly spacious and well-equipped fitness facility, and the big pool area.;5
Really nice stay. Cannot complain about anything. Be charming and the staff will be warm back for you.  Mohammed really made the stay fin for my kids. O asked of he might give us a higher floor on check-in. He said we had only paid for a regular room. I said ok no problem and smiled. Then Mohammed gave us a super room with a view anyway. What a dude.;5
After a last minute road trip we were tired and in search of a hotel for the night. Luckily Brian at the Hollywood hotel had a room for us and was extremely helpful even in the midnight hour. I would definitely return if I find myself back in LA.;5
When we entered into the hotel, the lobby gave the impression of being a classy and sophisticated hotel as well as it being modern.  We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful front desk who quickly got us settled into our room.  The room that we stayed in was extremely clean, decorated nicely, and the beds were large and had remarkably soft linens. The showers were amazingly comfortable and had a rainfall style to them.  I was treated with respect and had a great experience and would definitely recommend staying at this hotel again.;5
We felt so welcome here. Beds were very comfortable. Room slightly cold in bathroom but can cope.  Jeff the bell man gave us the time of day by giving us a map and highlighting the places for us to go. This made the holiday actually as we wouldnât have known or seen what we did.  We were very grateful and Jeff is an asset to your hotel.  I would recommend tea making facilities in the room to make the stay most enjoyable. Loved NYC :);5
Outstanding starting with Josna and complemented by Dwayne and Derrick.  This trio made a lasting impression on my wife and me.  The Hyatt is always provide excellent services, but coupled with staff that interactions with guest having such a positive affect is invaluable.;5
We arrived a little early and they had a room ready for us to put our stuff in and we got to enjoy the city a lot more that day. The staff was super nice and knowledgeable , the rooms were clean and exactly what we needed. We will be staying again come next October .;5
Pil is really attentive and caring for visitors, he tries to make your stay be wonderful and to make yourself feel at home. He is also very servicial and helps you out when youâre looking for tourist attractions, etc.;5
I was in one of the small single rooms and when you read they're approvimately 50 square foot in size you should know it's small, but thanks to some clever design (drawers beneath bed, large mirror on wall)  I never felt claustrophobic. Also I really only slept in the room. CafÃ© Gitane is superb and also opens at 7.00am, when most of New York is asleep (sorry folks but Frank Sinatra lied in song!). Also the bar at The Jane is very convenient for a night cap after a long day sightseeing. The staff were universally excellent and very helpful with tips on how to get to places, where to get your laundry done etc. Also my room was immaculately clean, serviced every day, as were the shared bathroon facilities. Plus I never had to wait to use the bathroom. Some nice touches included;5
"You know those 5* hotels who think of everything? Even those little things you didn't know you wanted or needed? Well this beautiful Riad does exactly that. Breakfast anytime of the day you want it? No problem. Snacks and mint tea anytime anywhere at no extra charge? Served with a smile. Someone to show you the way to the Souk? And cone back later to walk back with you? Happy to help. Add in ;super comfortable rooms with quality furnishings, linens and products. Lots of comfortable settees to laze around on. Super, quiet location and you'd have a great holiday but add in the exceptional staff and its the ultimate holiday accommodation. Extra special thanks to Elena and Sara.. It was like having your own team to advise, arrange, help, organise your stay. Literally nothing was too";5
I wasnt expecting this caliber of service. I had a great time at Empire, Im staying there again whenever I go to the city..  the doorman helped us out a lot and was the nicest guy you will ever meet in NYC he  helped us with everything!;5
Wonderful staff and beautiful rooms. Would recommend and visit again. Perfect location and newly renovated. Perfect for couples or single occupancy. Will most definitely absolutely without a doubt be back.;5
We stopped for 5 nights good room clean, spacious and the staff very helpful, Central Park is only a Block away, the subway is around 400 metres away. We didnât use the subway as most of locations are within 20 to 25 min away. We did try breakfast in the hotel but found it expensive for what was offered, this is just our opinion . Overall an excellent hotel;5
Got upgraded to a suite due to being a diamond member. helpful staff, room was big enough, good powerful shower, daily housekeeping, great location, good security downstairs (required us to show keycards to enter hotel part of the New Yorker). Good experience overall, thanks!;5
Pluses 1) Brilliant location to get to Universal Studios to 2) Very friendly and helpful staff 3) Rooms are sensibly sized and well maintained 4) Peaceful immediate surroundings  Minuses 1) Shower pressure was timid;5
Stayed for 5 nights in June 22 from check in to check out the was no issues at all, the staff are friendly & a credit to the hotel. Yes the hotel is a bit dated so if you wanting a shining new style this is not the place for you but if you want a hotel with character & charm this is the place. The room we had did not have a view but that was ok because as we know the size of NYC hotel rooms are on the small size the room we had was massive even having 2 bathrooms & the maids kept it spotless each day for us. I like the way you have to show your room key to get access to the lifts so the place feels safe. The only down thing for me is was the lack of no bar to have a drink in it's not the same sitting in a dinner or restaurant if you fancy a beer at the end of the day;5
I came to NYC to work for fashion week, and found that Empire Hotel is the place to be at- to see and be seen!! As I arrived I was pleasantly surprised with an upgrade of my room to deluxe! Mariana Mero was at the front desk and I have nothing but the best comments about her- helpful, knowledgeable and efficient!! My stay in the hotel was amazing, loved every second of it and would highly recommend to all my friends + business partners!!!;5
"The girl with the glasses is super awesome.  She had yellow painted finger nails!  She protected our heavy brass key every night and made sure to give it back to us so we could enter our room.   The guy working with her was also really cool.  He went out of his way to call up the Ace Hotel for accommodations over the weekend since the Jane was booked.    If we could have stayed longer we would have.  I think the bunk beds made the trip.  Awesome.   My hair still smells like peppermint from the shampoo.  There were was an old man with ashy skin walking back and forth in the halls in his bath towel at night and that made the hotel experience ""authentic"" for me.  The Jane is hip, fun, and we will definitely be back.  For a hostel the bathrooms were immaculate; the doors of the";5
We booked directly with the Raid and we stayed for 5 nights in the Rose room which was lovely and spacious. All the staff at the hotel where extremely helpful with everything from giving us directions to bringing us mint tea every time we returned from our daily travels. The hotel gives you a mobile phone in case you get lost and need help and they also offer to come and meet you to escort you back to the Raid if you require which is a excellent touch. ALL staff at the Raid are fantastic we would personally like to thank you Khalid who always welcomed us back with a friendly face every time and supplied us with endless cups of mint tea outstanding service.  I will be recommending you to any of my friends that are looking to visit Marrakech.   Danielle & Tom - UK;5
Not one to lavish 5* ratings (as I always think there could be something to improve upon) I couldn't not award this accolade to Riad Kherridine. The warm welcome began before our arrival with caring and informative e-mails to ensure our visit was well catered for and all our personal needs met with regards to excursions, tours etc. I agree with previous comments that the use of the tel for help when out and about was a plus, free laundry service, complimentary fruit, soft drinks all added that little bit extra to your stay. Because the Riad is quite small you experience a very personalised service . A little emotional on leaving which really isn't my style at all but it felt like we were saying farewell to family. Room was spotless and bed very comfy which rates highly for the;5
Iâm the type of traveler that would rather make quick fast decisions with an open calendar, than plan a schedule. We chose Hollywood hotel because itâs location quality and price, all 3 hit the mark.  Angelica and Pil were in the lobby ready to help us, we were super early for checkin and assumed we would just have to check our bags and go hang out somewhere else for a few hours, but nope Angelica got us in right away thankfully there was a room available, so no wait time just good friendly conversation about vacation and we got in our room in 5 minutes.. perfect!  Red eye flights are hard but Hollywood hotel made up for it.;5
Stayed here early June and totally satisfied with everything, the staff were very helpful and couldnât do enough for us, would definitely stay here again and hope to with the children.  Some time soon. Thank you very much.;5
Checked in for 4 nights in this hotel. The lobby is very impressive and the rest of the hotel doesn't disappoint.  Our room was lovely, tidied and replenished daily. The lady that checked us in was called Linda and was extremely helpful and polite, easy, smooth checkin.  We couldn't have asked for a better location of the hotel, perfectly placed for sightseeing in walking distance.  A thoroughly enjoyable stay,;5
This is a great hotel near the penn station so for traveling it is very easy to get to, great location for just about anything. The rooms were good sized for NY also clean. The staff friendly and helpful as well. Our friends at tourico got us a good price . We enjoyed the food downstairs and the broadway show we came to see. Check it out you will like it.....;5
Super property, in a great location. The Empire faces the small, but scenic Dante Park, and is just one block west of the SW corner of Central Park. It's diagonally across from the Lincoln Center. Great restaurants in short walking distance. The Empire is a renovated hotel. They did a great, hip job. The artful lobby was constantly being photographed by guests. The rooms are intimate, but not small. Well furnished with a hip sense of style. The staff are friendly and helpful. I would go back in a heartbeat!;5
"We have stayed at this hotel a few times before with several months beteween visits.  Still, we were recognized by staff and that did make us feel welcome.  An unusual occurance this time was that my wife forgot to confirm our reservation and so we went in without one.  The desk manager was very gracious and though the hotel was booked, was able to provide us with our usual ""Executive alcove corner room"" and we checked in without a hitch.  I would like to point our some of the staff.  First of all Tim, the doorman always recognizes us and asks about our daughter who we go down to visit.  He makes us feel like the hotel is our home away from home. I also what to give cudos to Amy in the Cafe Sierra for her excellent buffet service and Josh at the concierge desk took very good";5
We had a quick stay, but we enjoyed the hotel immensely.  Was a perfect location near Central Park, Lincoln Center, and Columbus Circle.  Staff was professional and friendly, and the rooftop bar was great, and the rooftop pool deck was a great escape from the busy streets!;5
We stayed at the new yorker for six nights, the girl at reception made sure we had a room with a view , a view of the empire state building no less, the staff were always friendly and helpful,  the room was clean tidy and comfortable, perfect location, subway station just outside,  walking distance to times square, bars and diners close by,  maceys just up the road, yellow cabs always outside if you needed one, if one not there, the doorman hailed one for you, would highly recommended staying here, we would return without hesitation;5
Excellent location beautiful room wonderful helpful staff I can definitely recommend this hotel  my room was spacious and comfortable the bed was extremely comfortable  I was able to walk from Penn station right to the hotel without any trouble dining options in the hotel are very good and exercise room and business center is available but I did not use them a must see is the museum of photographs in the basement documenting the history of the hotel k;5
The hotel staff was awesome! The location is great. I'm from NY & picked the New Yorker mainly cause of location & an awesome staff. You can walk almost every where or catxh any train line at Penn Station.;5
From the moment we arrived to when we left..The staff at The Empire Hotel, especially Michelene, exceeded are expectations. From the comfort of the room to the location, it made for a perfect time. When we checked out, we went and had lunch upstairs at Ed's Chowder House, which was fantastic as well.;5
The location is perfect. The hotel is clean and the rooms spacious and comfortable!  My family and I felt safe there. The staff was very professional and super friendly. The breakfast was delicious and a nice variety.   I highly recommend this hotel!;5
"Clean, fresh room and relaxing rooms. Fantastic shower!  Blutooth phone-based keys, with self check-in, was smooth and easy; a good feature when arriving late and tired. Bar and restaurant staff were all excellent: friendly, professional, competent and genuine. Easy to walk from the terminals - might even be faster than waiting for a bus! Not cheap, but reasonable value for money.";5
Comfy beds and pillows.. really hot water and nice shower with waterfall and hand held fixture. Great location!! They offer breakfast and happy hour at the bar each night. Staff was super friendly. Iâd stay here again!!;5
The Wyndham New Yorker Hotel is a superb facility.  The team members were always polite and helpful.  The food at the Tic Tock (Cafe) was always GREAT!  I will ALWAYS choose to make reservations, in the future, here!;5
Simply loved this hotel. Great location, very close to a subway station. The room is huge , very clean and has fridge, wi fi and even mouthwash. Have no words to describe the staff. They are very helpful and make you feel like home. The breakfast is excellent. Hugo and Sonia prepare the best waffles and omelets you have ever eaten. They are also very friendly and made my trip memorable. When returning to Los Angeles, The Hollywood Hotel is certainly my first choice.;5
I hardly ever write a review before I leave the property, but I had some time so I decided to review the night before we left. Everything that the website shows/guarantees is exactly what you get. The outside of the Riad would have you questioning the facility, but once you step through those doors the ambiance is ð¯. A cell phone is provided to help you return back Riad. The pool, the views from the rooftop, the food all are awesome! The customer service reminds you of the Ritz Carlton and Chic-Fil-A. This Riad has Four Seasons accommodations and a Marriott budget. Itâs highly recommended!;5
The Hyatt Regency LAX was very contemporary in decor and modern in design. I was impressed and wasnât expecting it to be so. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the hotel. The shuttle to and from airport was free and  the food bar was pretty decent it what it had to offer and not too overpriced. The front desk staff, concierge, and valet were all very helpful and kind. I would certainly stay at this location again;5
Nice hotel good location very clean...best part is breakfast!  Sonia and her team deliver delicious food and great service...Would definitely recommend...if I had to nitpick would say the hot water was in short supply but all that does is wake me up quicker;5
The hotel is right next to the airport, which is very helpful so as to avoid long, expensive cab rides in LA traffic.  The hotel is modern, clean, and spacious.  Rooms are very comfortable and all the amenities are right there.  Enjoyed a great view, and enjoyed a sofa and chair in my room.  There could be a bit more light in the bathrooms, but natural light from the windows helped that.  Housekeeping staff are great and do a fabulous job.;5
Amazing hotel, right next to Times Square and other landmarks. Staff are extremely helpful and the door men are very friendly and helpful with directions, especially Jeff who makes you feel at home and comfortable.;5
"I checked in to the Ameritania after a horrible experience at a prior hotel, the manager, Matthew checked me in and could probably sense I just had an unpleasant experience. When he asked me how I was doing and I ""vented"" -he magically took all my worries away and assured me I was in a much better place. And it was exactly that. He made my check in extremely smooth, assured me my room was taken care of, showed me the bar area, and even gave me a complimentary drink card to enjoy during my stay. As much as I want to rave about the cleanliness and decor-the staff really made my experience so pleasant. From check-in to check-out; everyone was so kind. The door guys were helpful with my luggage, Matthew was top-of-the-line, and during check out, two women were just really";5
Pleasantly surprised. Great location. Cool decor. Welcoming and most accommodating, friendly service from the whole staff (Front desk and doormen ( including Jeff ) So personable and helpful. Rooms well appointed, good amenities. Bed a little soft for our taste. Minor in the schemes of things. Really enjoyed our stay and canât wait to come back.;5
Clean rooms, 5 minutes walk from Universal Hollywood. Better to walk than to take the transport tram as it goes around the long route and it drops you off at the City Walk and not at the Universal entrance. We were these in Dec. and it was freezing so riding the open tram would have been torture.;5
Since this was the last leg of our trip we decided to stay somewhere really good and we have not been disappointed.  From the moment we arrived until we left all the staff have been absolutely fabulous.  The buffet breakfast was excellent and the service in this restaurant was faultless.  I would like to make special mention of âInkyâ each morning we had breakfast we noticed how hard he worked and how pleasant he was to everyone he came in contact with.  His work ethic blew us away.  Inky youâre amazing!!  That smile of yours lights up the whole room!!  So thanks Hilton Universal City for a fabulous end to our holiday.  Great location away from the centre of LA without being too far.  We will Definitely be back when we visit LA.;5
The experience we had at the empire hotel, was in one word amazing! The service was excellent, all the people who worked there were so nice to us! Sharde from the reception has been the greatest, with the incheck for us, after a long day of travel we had a very warm welcome! The hotel has a very good location nearby a very convenient metro station. The beds were hard i thought, but slept perfect! Shower were very nice, not getting from f.warm to cold all the time, always consistent.;5
Big mix up with my booking. No problem for Pil to help out and get me going right. Must say very friendly staff for such a nice hotel. Rooms are a bit small but perfect for my stay. First time in California and so far it has been a great stay. Will returned for sure.;5
I am a vegetarian who loves my carbs. When I tried to find meatless biscuits and gravy on the breakfast buffee, there was nothing available. After watching me shuffle around for severals minuets, Diego, the cook manning the omelette station, asked what I was looking for. When I explained it, he reassured me he would start some plain biscuits and ask the chef about mealtless gravy. The chef was unfamiliar with white country gravy. In seeing my dismay, Diego googled a recipe and proceeded to make my gravy at the omelette station. It was the best gravy I have ever eaten. The biscuits were as big as my head, fluffy and amazing.  Outstanding customer service and truely an above and beyond spirit not often seen anywhere today. On your trip, look up Diego. He will most definitely make;5
We stayed here for 6 nights and visited the city of LA and Hollywood for first time sight seeing. The hotel staff were so nice and helpful. We parked in self service lot beneath hotel, easy access, but costly, no wifi unless honors member or fee. We stayed in upper floor and it was very quiet. Location was great walked to Metro to go one stop to walk of fame and sights, felt safe walking area, concierge assisted us with how to navigate metro. Restaurant very expensive we did not eat there, $52 pp for buffet! We ate breakfast snacks from lobby coffee shop. Overall I would stay here again if I ever came back for a visit. Universal studios and city walk across the street and that was so convenient!;5
Excellent location close to Train station also. Room got nice space compare with standard room offer in NYC.  Lobby and room looks good.  It is a little nossy during the night but that is normal for that area.  I will repeat it agaain next time.;5
We had such a great stay at the empire. We traveled with 2 small children and selected the double bed room. The room was small but anyone that is expecting a large spacious room anywhere in NYC should book a suite. We had a laundry issue due to a mix up and the management was amazing and went above and beyond our expectations. The neighborhood is great, being originally from the upper west side we wanted to stay where we felt most familiar. Central Park is extremely close, the 1 train is a short walk away which you can transfer to the 2/3 at time square or 72nd street. Access to great restaurants as well.  We will be staying here again.;5
Was a great location and is so convenient to Lincoln center. Has a wonderful upstairs bar and lounge as well as the hotel bar. Staff is friendly and helpful. Also in a great location for all of upper west side!;5
Very clean and friendly place-convenient to all parts of NYC. Front desk was helpful with any request we had. Comfortable room. Our second stay-would definitely recommend for future stays. Restaurants and pubs nice and convenient close by.;5
I spent a week in The Jane whilst travelling across America, it is a gem of a place. Didn't eat there but the room is perfect for a solo traveler on a budget, comfortable with amenities. Wasn't sure how I felt about sharing bathroom facilities but they were always kept clean and never had any trouble. When I got an ear infection the concierge were only happy to arrange a hospital appointment for me and sort out transport.  Lovely location as well.;5
Check was at 3 pm,  I arrived very early around 9.  No problem, immediately given a room.  Will never take a 5 am flight again.  Extremely courteous and helpful staff.  Will make this my go to Hotel whenever I am in Manhattan.;5
Really nice stay. Cannot complain about anything. Be charming and the staff will be warm back for you.  Mohammed really made the stay fin for my kids. O asked of he might give us a higher floor on check-in. He said we had only paid for a regular room. I said ok no problem and smiled. Then Mohammed gave us a super room with a view anyway. What a dude.;5
Where do i start ? 1st easy to reach from penn station. 2nd reception staff were fantastic. 3rd room was really clean and view was brilliant. 4th location for most attractions was brilliant. 5th all the staff were brilliant and thank you all for a memorable 1st visit to new york hope to see you all again soon;5
Check in was efficient taking only 3 minutes where I received a requested room upgrade facing away from the Studios nearby for an extra $20 per night.. Elevators are fast and numerous with almost no wait in both directions. Staff are friendly and give the impression that they genuinely want to help whever they can. The room was very quiet, spacious with a well fitted bathroom and the air con worked perfectly.  Wireless internet had a good reception in the room but was quite slow all for $8 per day. (Careful, they charge for each device connected!). The outstandng feature of this hotel is the fantastic buffet meals served every breakfast ($20) and Dinner ($44). The quality is excellent and variety outstanding with live music (piano) in the evenings..   The only negative comment;5
Excellent room service.  Had bagel, lox & cream cheese and tuna sandwich with large milk.  Excellent presentation and quality of food served at 2 am.  Extremely costly at the same time.  If you are comfortable with a large, a bit ostentatious lobby with beautiful, clean, spacious rooms, it's likely the place for you.;5
Was upgraded on arrival to the 35th floor. 4 adults (me & 3 adult kids) shared a room - more than comfortable in the room. Fabulous views over the Hudson River. No street noise facing this direction. Bed super comfy. Enjoyed watching the free TV with movies at night. Shower good. Good cupboard space for all our shopping purchases! Definitely got a good nights sleep after a hard day pounding the attractions of NYC. The location was superb, across the street from Penn Station where we got the Amtrak to Newark Airport. Couldn't have asked for better. This was my 4th trip to NYC and for location & comfort & price I would definitely come back to the New Yorker. Loved the Art Deco of the public areas and rooms - felt like a step back in time! Hope you enjoy and if you want big massive;5
Such an amazing hotel and very staff. The first person to look after us was Mohammad at front desk. He gave us a beautiful room with an amazing view. Thanks Muhammad. Great way to start our first trip to New York;5
This hotel is a short, easy hotel shuttle ride from LAX and really fits the bill for everything you would want in an airport hotel.  It is clean, efficient, modern, and the beds are super comfortable.  The hotel has an excellent breakfast buffet, an airy lobby, great wifi and nice showers.  The staff makes clear they are at your service and really want to make your stay a good one.  My only suggestion would be an upgrade in towels, which in my opinion were fine, but not as nice as they should be for a hotel of this calibre.;5
I had an amazing experience with the hotel manager named Yaya, my dad was on a trip for his birthday and I wanted to surprise him with birthday balloons and more in his room, she had a great attitude and helped me every step of the way with me not even being there in person. Her and her staff is very friendly and helpful. Thank you Yaya for a great experience and for all of your help as well!;5
A beautiful hotel with excellent decor, it lived up to expectations! The location is perfect, opposite the Lincoln Center and near Central Park. Great service from the staff outside to inside the hotel, a special mention to the door men and Maggi the receptionist. Highly recommended.;5
All staff and employees always so welcoming and friendly. Rooms are always so clean and we love being central to everything. Have stayed here many times and always a great experience. It's our 1st choice Hotel every time.;5
"We stayed eight nights at the Empire and it was an excellent experience. I had emailed the General Manager before we left to advise that my wife & I were on our honeymoon (10 years late) and wondered if the hotel could lay on a surprise for her. I thought a complimentary drinks voucher in the bar or something. However, when we checked in, the receptionist Zunachy stated that ""we were expecting you - welcome to New York. We've given you a complimentary room upgrade"" (by Don). Super I thought, but what was waiting for us was amazing! We had a corner room (more of a suite) on the ninth floor, with plenty of room for the two of us. That was not all: half an hour later a knock at the door took us by surprise. It was a waiter bringing us 'Champagne' and chocolate-dipped strawberries.";5
We recently went on our honeymoon to Morocco and spent 5 nights at Riad Kheirredine and absolutely loved it.  The staff are incredibly friendly and at the same time very down to earth and relaxed, making the experience very comfortable and like a home away from home.  The attention to detail was outstanding and they were very attentive to each and every request we made, whether it was to arrange a tour, prepare a meal, or help us navigate this amazing city.  We are already looking forward to eventually returning and would highly recommend Riad Kheirredine as the perfect place for honeymooners, couples, or a family vacation.;5
We stayed at this hotel due to its great location near Universal Studios.  The staff was super and made our stay extra memorable by suggesting fun places to visit.  We were walking distance from Universal Studios and City Walk.  I've stayed at nice hotels before and they nickel and dime you for everything, but not this one, I actually had complimentary coffee and Wifi!;5
Great hotel to stay. On a nice location and great customer service. We enjoyed from the stay! We came here after 5 nights on the center of NYC. Totally recommend! Thanks for everything Astor staff! (ask for room with park view- lovely view);5
The service at this lovely Riad was really astonishing. So warm, so generous, so friendly. truly delightful people. Tasty breakfast. Well designed rooms, but mostly, the most attentive staff I've ever experienced.   The only slight quibble I have with the Riad is with the beds, which were hard as concrete. But the lovely staff put a comforter down for me to make it a bit softer. The pillows were also very hard, and there were no duvet covers, which was an oversight that could (and should) be easily fixed.;5
We love coming back to The Empire Hotel for our annual NYC Christmas visit. It offers very nice accommodations at a reasonable price. It's central location (right off Columbus Circle - Upper West Side) is convenient for the Lincoln Center for Performing Arts, Central Park, Theater District, Hell's Kitchen and more.;5
We had a lovely 4 night stay at the Ameritania! Comfortable beds, spacious room, amazing bathroom. We had a room upgrade without asking which was a nice surprise and the staff left a lovely note and wine for my mum as we were celebrating her 60th  WiFi worked great and the location was perfect for us. 5 minute walk from Times Square and 10 minutes from Central Park, also itâs close to blue, yellow and red metro routes.  The staff we spoke to were very friendly and accommodating, when I next visit NYC I will be sure to stay at the Ameritania again. Thank you;5
The Wyndham New Yorker is a beautiful old hotel that is all updated and has nice clean rooms with beautiful views.The lobby is very warm and inviting. It is very secure as you need a room key to pass the person at the elevators. The fitness center is huge and has a variety of machines and weights. This hotel is so convenient to the subway, practically out the door. Also, very affordable for NYC.;5
If you would like a comfortable stay in a convenient location during your trip to NYC, look no further than the New Yorker. The Tick Tock diner that is in the Hotel lobby has decent food at a reasonable price.;5
I often stay at this Hyatt, both as an individual and with the large groups that I coordinate. Whether I am just one person coming in for the night, or overseeing 500 people coming in for a weekend, the hotel always treats me and my groups like true VIP's.  I oversee lots of events at lots of hotels, and the team here is truly one of the best. From the valet, front desk, restaurant, housekeeping, sales office, banquet staff, and beyond, I have never been disappointed by this team. On the off chance that something doesn't go right the first time, the Hyatt LAX team is always right there to fix it.;5
I was so impressed with the service of this hotel. One of the staff, Mor Radmy, worked with me during my planning to make sure our rooms were next to each other. When we got to the hotel she was ready and waiting to help check everyone in. She also worked with the groom to help deliver a surprise of snacks and bubbly sent to the room! The hotel itself is in a great location for shopping, arts, park, and of course food. It's very clean, and in the summer the roof top deck is great for large or small parties to enjoy the urban jungle.;5
I stayed with my daughter in Dec 2018 for a second time and during the course of the stay there was, unfortunately, cause for complaint. When I arrived home, via email I was dealt with extremely professionally by Megan who I believe is a customer service manager. She resolved my complaint within two days and is a real credit to your hotel. Donât get me wrong it is a lovely hotel, great location, comfortable beds and showing your room passes before accessing the lifts made both myself and my teenage daughter feel safe. Iâve gone from being unsure about returning again to quite confident that we will. Thank you from a very happy customer;5
Great place to lay over for the price. Shuttle bus was easy once we figured out where to get it. Make sure you know where to pick it up before you go is my tip. Room price was reasonable. We just wanted a place to rest our heads between flights and this was perfect.;5
I had originally booked a hotel on Sunset Boulevard but after reading the reviews for it and worrying about the location I decided to book elsewhere. Even though this hotel was quite a lot more than what I would have paid origianlly I am so glad I booked it! The hotel is away from most of the main attractions in LA but its not impossible to get anywhere - we used taxis a couple of times and there is a metro station just down the hill that takes you to Hollywood or downtown. The hotel is lovely inside and seemed very clean. Our room was huge and had really nice views. We used the pool a couple of times which again was very nice, they have cabanas which can be used free of charge. We ate at the Atrium Lounge in the hotel a few times and the food was very good. They also have happy;5
We had a magnificent visit to the Universal Hilton.  Jesse (Concierge) was absolutely wonderful.  He recommended some fabulous restaurants, the best ways to get around, and went out of his way to insure our visit was spectacular....and it was.  The amenities were excellent.  The food in the main dining room and the lounges was out of this world.  Our first meal was a seafood buffet on Friday, October 20th.  It was GLORIOIS! Best meal I've had in quite some time. Room was delightful.  Service was spectacular.  I couldn't think of a better place to stay on a return trip to L.A.;5
We stayed one night at this hotel in order to be close to Universal Studios which is a short walk away from the property.  They have a shuttle bus, but we didn't take it.  The room we had was spectacular.  I believe we were on the 17th floor in a suite.  The views of LA were fantastic as the whole front of the room were windows.  The room itself had a couch, a desk, a mini refrigerator and a separate bathroom.  The bathroom was just like a spa bathroom, very roomy, clean, modern and very good lighting.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  My only complaint was the location of the TV.  It was located in a cabinet and was hard to see from the bed, and it was a little small for the room. They had a very nice outdoor pool, which we didn't use.  I would highly recommend this hotel.;5
"We arrived from the east coast after plane and car delays at midnight, completely exhausted, for a one night stay. Our check in was quick and our rooms were clean and comfortable. We had asked for toothbrushes and toothpaste to be left in the room, and there were 4 of each.  We slept well; no noise and ac worked perfect. The buffet breakfast was excellent!  My picky eaters have talked about it the entire trip: egg white omlets with anything, fruit, cereal, muffins, bread, yogurt, waffles, eggs,etc..the staff was amazingly kind and we felt special.  Parking is really expensive.";5
"3rd Floor Queen Room - NOT GOOD BED PILLOWS this time! Otherwise good ""Front Desk"" service and ""Hugo and Staff at Breakfast Buffet"" are always exceptional!!. PARKING CHARGE is NOT right...an extra non-warranted charge (just because we can park behind an iron gate!!)  If you want me to keep writing 200 characters...don't know what else I can share.";5
amazing city view with liberty statue. affordable price at a core location. Very next to Penn station, probably the closest one. Absolutely a 3 star and above hotel.  the services are very professional and friendly.;5
Brilliant hotel, very central too pretty much everything, obviously walking is involved in New York.  Penn station is pretty much next-door which is a good thing if you donât mind the tube from the airport.   Staff were all friendly and helpful and Iâd defo stay again, also the restaurant attached to the hotel is great for pancakes in the morning.;5
We stayed here for two separate one-night stays in the span of about two weeks. Both times we were very satisfied with the stay. The rooms are spacious, modern, and comfortable with all of the amenities we expected to see. The lobby has several open areas for gathering, eating, and drinking with varying atmospheres depending on how casual you want to be. We ate once at the hotel bar and ordered room service once. On both occasions the food was very good and service was quick. We will certainly keep the Hyatt on our short list of hotel options when we fly out of LAX. My only complaint (albeit minor) about either stay was that the wine list on the room service menu was not accurate as my wife tried to order two different white wines on the menu that the hotel did not have in stock.;5
Stayed here over Christmas and must say it was such a nice hotel. Check in was really quick with an upgrade to a view of Universal. Room was very big, with a massive bed, was warm and comfortable.  Took the shuttle bus to and from universal studios and city walk several times. Concierge was amazing they helped us sort out a trip to WB studio tour and a car to take us, same with a trip to Hollywood. We used to the business centre twice to print out tickets and boarding passes. staff in the bar where friendly and attentive and took time to chat to you.  We have room service on Christmas Day, it was tasty and came quick, we ate at the Sierra Cafe on Christmas night and it was lovely. Check out was quick and easy, can honestly say there isn't a bad thing I can say about this hotel;5
I've stayed here several times on business, but this time I planned a special birthday for my husband and Michelle Lu took such good care of us and our visit to New York.  She was so accommodating and so helpful with planning a special weekend.  I didn't have to think of anything!  I always contact Michelle every time I need a room because I know she will handle my request quickly, accurately, and with great care!  The front desk staff helped me out as well with special requests since I was also partially there on business.  The room we had was roomy, clean, and had wonderful windows overlooking the Lincoln Center.  It was walking distance to everything and had a restaurant inside for the ultimate convenience.  And I didn't have problems with wifi, my keys, or any of those;5
A beautiful Art Deco hotel in a perfect position. All staff were helpful and the facilities immaculate. The room was large and had 2 bathrooms which was great as there were 4 of us sharing. Some Original features remained which we loved. The food in the Tick Tock diner was fantastic and the service excellent. Highly recommended. Would definitely visit again.;5
We arrived quite late in the evening, check was very fast and the staff were so friendly. We had been upgraded which I was super chuffed with. Walked into room OMG!!!! it was massive, the room was amazing, the view was amazing (overlooking Hogwarts), the bathroom was bigger than the hotel room we had stayed in night before, the bed was super comfortable (I could live in that bed!) Safe to say we had an amazing nights sleep and awoken fresh and ready for a day at universal.  We headed down to breakfast, this wasn't included in price of stay which I was of my only complaints, we had decided in room we were just going to order off menu but when we got to restaurant and saw the buffet our minds were changed straight away. This is by far THE BEST BUFFET BREAKFAST I have ever seen! It;5
U are gonna ask for JEFF he was amazing he was great he helped make sure we got to the the airport on time and made sure that we were comfortable in our room and he was very nice just a amazing person in general!!;5
I did not know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  The location was excellent - right across from Lincoln Center.  The hotel lobby, roof top deck and my room were lovely.  The room small (expected in NYC) but the bed was VERY comfortable, and adequately appointed.  I will definitely return, especially if I can get the low rate again;5
Prior to our visit, the reviews for Riad Kheirredine here felt a bit far-fetched, but it is every bit as perfect as everyone says it is. The service is above and beyond anywhere I've ever stayed before. A beautiful, tranquil oasis amid the madness of the city. Couldn't recommend it more highly.;5
We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Wyndham. It really is a great hotel. We caught the train from JFK and arived at Penn Station to find the hotel conveniently locaed cross the street. The check in was smooth, quick and the staff were extremely friendly & polite. We were on the 29th floor and although we didn't get a view of the Empire State Building, the view we had was great. The room was a little smaller than we expected for the States and found we had to climb over the beds to get around if someone was sat at the desk. The beds were comfortable and we slept very well. The ony slight criticism I would make is that the bathrooms could do with a major overhaul. I never got the temperature in the the shower right the whole time I was there, it was either scalding;5
Great hotel in a great location!  The staff was wonderful and the room was comfortable and clean. The price was very reasonable for the location. The hotel was walking distance to many of the great tourist spots.  I highly recommend the hotel!;5
Spent a week at Riad Kheirredine in March with two girlfriends and we could not have had a better experience!!  Beautiful riad, great location and fantastic staff!  The riad is absolutely lovely - beautifully renovated with gorgeous Moroccan architectural details.  It has 2 charming courtyard spaces to relax in and we loved having breakfast and end of day cocktails on the beautiful rooftop terrace with views of the city and mountains.  We didn't use, but riad also has 2 plunge pools.  We stayed in 2 different rooms over the week - Saffron and Verveine - both were beautifully decorated, comfortable, immaculate, and well stocked with amenities. The location of the riad was great - tucked away in a quiet part of the medina, but an easy walk to the souks, Jemaa el-Fnaa, and Jardin;5
Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were most helpful and very friendly. They dealt will any queries calmly. They were also very relaxed with us staying in the hotel lobby long after we had checked out. Fantastic location too. Would recommend to family and friends.;5
We arrived at 4am due to flight delays, and were given the last room on property - noisy street level. We didn't complain but were given a new room the following day. Due to a housekeeping mix up, the new room wasn't cleaned and we were forced to take a noisy street level room next to the stairwell. The following day, the guest clerk who had arranged for us to move to a nicer room greeted us with the news that due to our inconvenience, he was arranging for us to move to a suite. He was very embarrassed, and actually had come in the night before at midnight to sort out what happened. He had left clear instructions with the evening desk clerk, but there was nothing they could do. Not only did he go above and beyond - we had never complained - he escorted us to the room himself and;5
Beautiful, well furnished room and excellent view. Spacious, well-designed bathroom. Helpful, efficient service. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Efficient transportation system to Universal Studios.;5
The rooms are clean and decent size for NYC.  The lobby is basic and has a lounge that is a good meeting spot before heading out.  Close to the subway lines and only two blocks to Times Square.  The property is a good choice for anyone looking for a basic fair price hotel.;5
We stayed in the New Yorker hotel from the 25th of august to 1st of September,   We found our stay in the hotel absolutely fantastic.   Front desk was very friendly and put us at ease immediately as it was our first trip to the big apple we were very nervous.   Our room size was adequate for a family of 4, 2 adults 2 children aged 12 and 15.   The shower was always hot and the pressure was like a power shower.   Although the room was a little dated,it was very clean and our view from our window was amazing... We could see Madison square garden and the empire state.   The long was what attracted me as it was proper art deco from the old movies and I wanted the kids to get a wow factor as they entered the building.    There is security in the loby by the elevators who need to see;5
Enjoyable and comfortable stay, Lovely location near central park, friendly staff only downfall was the check in deposit which we wasn't told about during booking and the veiw (a different wall of the hotel so had to close all curtains whilst getting ready);5
We had a great experience with everyone especially Jeff he was knowledgeable and friendly  The front desk was nice and it was easy to check in and out ! The location of the hotel made our stay even better easy to get to subway;5
This was a great place to stay - an oasis in the craziness of Marrakech. Everything here was well thought out. The staff were lovely and tended to every need' friendly yet professional. Nothing was too much trouble. You are walked through the medina until you feel comfortable and given a mobile phone to contact the Riad if you get lost.  The property is immaculate and the food delicious - breakfast is a feast! You can have it wherever suits you - I suggest the rooftop. Having stayed in A LOT of places around the world I would suggest this being one of the best in terms of service. Thanks to all the straff who made our stay so memorable.;5
My family and I had planned a trip but due to COVID it got cancelled. However, the staff at New Yorker, particularly Neida Aldama, communicated with us in detail and clarified all our doubts. The hotel gave us a voucher to be used since it was a non-refundable booking, and Neida played a really important role in communicating between us and the hotel back and forth. Sheâs warm, welcoming, nice, kind and an excellent staff, and I hope to meet her whenever me and my family plan to use the voucher to stay at the New Yorker!;5
the lobby was nice and large and the price for the size of the room was great.  Also it is very close to Penn station so you can take the Amtrak here and stay at the hotel without driving into NY.  It has a restaurant that serves food 24/7 and the food service was good and fast.  We would definitely stay here again.  Custom service was great.;5
Five ð Star from the moment I checked in till I left the next day. Every employee I encountered, whether check in, restaurant, bar, deli, or room service were exceptionally personable, friendly, and competent. As a single woman staying overnight in LA, it was great not to have to leave the hotel for anything! In fact, I was treated like I was the only guest. I will be a loyal customer for always.;5
The hotel is located in Universal City and is a few minutes from Universal Studios. There is a shuttle service that goes from the hotel to Universal Studios and arrives every 15 minutes or so. Breakfast was fantastic! Lots to choose from. The bed was very comfortable. The service was very good. The only thing to note is that for anyone needing to buy stamps for postcards, they overcharge in the gift shop. It's easier to find a post office or something. Nothing is central in LA, unlike in other cities. So getting from point A to point B is always difficult and a car is needed. I am told by those there that transit is not good and that there is no subway system.;5
The hotel is a little tired looking however they are currently renovating it so I expect this will improve.  Otherwise it is perfectly fine for a Premier Inn and in potentially the best location for tourists visiting London, literally right next to the London Eye and an easy walk to Parliament and Big Ben etc.  We found all staff encountered throughout the hotel really pleasant, friendly and helpful.  We had breakfast each day which was reasonable enough.  Our family room was also surprisingly big so we were really comfortable in the room itself.;5
Great service at the Empire Hotel. Really enjoyed the rooftop lounge. Michael and Lyonel were great and mixed up some fantastic drinks. Can't beat the view from up top. Will definitely be coming back soon.;5
i had a long day at work me and hubby took a lil break away and angela was amazing customer service was wonderful room was clean she went above and behind definitely will be booking again THANKS ANGELA. she was real friendly and sweet had me smiling and laughing;5
This hotel is phenomenal. I returned for a second stay after a great first experience. Location is excellent, the staff are fantastic, and the rooms are great. I will be back again! Miguel is one of the best employees I have ever dealt with.;5
Everything worked really well for us in this hotel. Easy check with helpful staff, straight in with recommendations and maps etc. We had four nights in this hotel, 6 of us, me and my partner and our 4 `'children' aged 20-16! We had 3 rooms with 2 double beds in each, they were a really good size for NYC. When we booked I knew it was fairly central but didn't realise how good it was. Minutes from Times Square and Central Park but not right in the middle of the madness of Times Square!! Two really stood out - Jeff on the door made everyone feel really welcome, sorted Taxis and transfer back to JFK for a cheaper price than we had booked for the incoming transfer and the barman - same one each night but even though i didn't get his name he made the bar a great place to finish off;5
"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. From the minute you enter the door until you leave, the staff will make everything possible for you to enjoy your stay. They definitely go out of their way from providing a cell phone, making restaurant and tour reservations and even walking you to places in the medina.  Our room (Imperial Suite -Sandal) was one of the best. We even had a separate living area and a huge balcony with daybed. Could not have asked for more. The roof top terrace was our favorite place to hang out. The maid service was excellent; they always made sure fresh fruit and water was available in the room.  The whole staff of the hotel made our stay one of a kind. Nothing was ever to much for them. Many thanks to Elena, Sarah, Houda and all the others whose";5
"Just returned from a 5 day family vacation to NYC at beginning of August. This was one of the best hotel experiences I've had. The staff at the hotel was so helpful and nice. Front desk was able to answer all of our ""tourist"" questions. The person who stood out most was Said, one of the bellman, who was able to give us lots of helpful info about NYC, where to find good restaurants, grocery, subway stations, etc. He went above and beyond to ensure we had a good stay. The location of the hotel is great - walk to all theaters in minutes, Central Park, MOMA, Hell's Kitchen area (great food and reasonably priced), Times Square. The Residence Fee at this hotel was one of the most reasonable I've seen, and you get free coffee in the morning and snacks in the afternoon! (be sure to";5
This place is a secret gem . Also Checkin in was a breeze thanks to pil with one l  . He made us feel right at home from the moment we walked in. Me and my furry little friend are happy campers. Thanks;5
the employees were very informative and very helpful they were also willing to help you the prices in the room were very high for the items housing housekeeping should've done a rotten could've done a better job never left extra toilet paper sometimes the towels were the same and the  vacuum in the the room was horrible;5
Stayed for 10 nights in December 2021.  Paid for a room upgrade, and was not disappointed!  Large room with two very comfortable double beds, one each for me and my daughter.  Oh and the pillows were the best! We also had the added bonus of a view of The Empire State Building.  Room was spotlessly clean, thanks to housekeeping staff, all who were genuinely nice people, as were all the staff we dealt with. Tik Tok diner was also a bonus, again the staff were really lovely.   Location is excellent for navigating around the city. Close enough to walk to a number of locations, and close to Penn Station/ other subway stations Iâve been to NYC a number   of times, though this was my first time staying at The New Yorker.   I wouldnât hesitate in staying here again.;5
We certainly recommend this hotel, great location to many activities.  Bell and valet staff outstanding!  Never used a concierge before, she was amazing!  I do have an issue with paying so much for parking when there really isn't another option.  However the extra $4 for valet was worth it.  Love having free Wifi in the room;5
We stayed at the Riad Kheirredine in April and found the entire experience excellent. Perhaps some of that was good luck with the weather being great, warm and sunny but not too hot and snow still on the mountains but most of the success of this trip is down to the attention from the Riad staff to make sure we got the best from our stay. Exploring Marrakech, the souks, the square and the alleyways could be a bit of an adventure but the hotel staff were always delighted to take us where we wanted to go, if we wanted them to, and they gave us a mobile phone so we could always call them to come and find us if we got lost or worried. It all meant that we could explore with more confidence and so enjoy Marrakech to the full and there's a lot to experience in Marrakech. We chose to;5
Our stay at the Empire Hotel was really awesome. The place of the hotel is perfect (close to the Central Park).  The Stuff is friendly and very courteous. Especially we would like to say thank you to Mr. Ze who was kind and helpful in every situation.  Next time we will definitely stay at the Empire Hotel!;5
The thing . that impressed me the most was your staff.They were helpful and courteousThey showed great respect for my military service;5
Rob did welcome us very friendly! Super hotel , very hygienic. Rob did everything to let us feel confortable! Location is perfect. Broadway and times square is 2min walking. I would higly recommend this hotel for everyone.;5
We stayed here for four nights the hotel is in a great location staff were helpful and friendly room was very clean and comfortable tick tock diner is on ground floor of hotel we used it every day food and service was excellent also there are two other restaurants in the hotel our first time to New York hopefully if we return we wouldn't hesitate to use the New Yorker again.;5
Excellent hotel and location, but the cleaning service of the rooms must be sure before entering the rooms because they found me bathing and it was in bad taste, also they must add breakfast for the price of the room;5
"Wonderful and exotic experience. The Riad is in the middle of the medina of marrakech, so we had the feeling that we were ""locals"" and not just tourists. The Riad is very beautiful and has a very morrocan style. A perfect combination between luxurious and casual. The room was superb. The pool area was amazing. The main restaurant is really prettty and we also ate in the terrace at nigth. The food is very good and we had a special treatment, because it was my husband aniversary. Breakfast was magnificient. Going trough the medina was very easy because there was always someone from the staff that would help you go to a taxi spot. Also, they gave us a mobile phone that we could use if we ever got lost, were in need of a taxi or needed someone to pick us up anywhere. We felt very";5
The bartender ( victor) @ the lobby bar was amazing and made one of the best Bloody Maryâs my wife has ever had , his attitude and attention to detail were amazing he even did a table side smoke of my old fashion! The staff @ Hilton/ universal helped make a wonderful experience start to finish for my entire family and I !;5
I stayed at the Hilton the weekend before Christmas, because I was attending a concert at Universal City Walk. I was torn between the Hilton and the Sheraton, but I relied on the reviews from this website and was satisfied with my choice. The Staff was friendly. The Hotel was beautiful. The room was large and clean. It was a really nice room. The view was also lovely. I only booked the room for one nite, but when it was time to checkout I was not ready to go. There wasn't a lot of noise, like at other hotels. It you are going to Universal Studios or Universal City Walk, it is the closest hotel. You can actually walk to Universal City Walk or take the shuttle. I am very cheap, but I think I got a good deal. I regret that once again I forgot my camera, and didn't take pictures.;5
"Front desk agents very helpfulNd friendly, my room was located on the 7th floor,small room but very clean, i asked a room attendant that was cleaning next door if i can get two extra bottles of water and she was so nice and kind giving me a nice smile gave it to me without hesitation, then i went back to my room and grabbed 5 dollars to tip her but she said ""its ok sir you dont have to tip me"" but i insisted until she took it her name was Jessica such a nice young lady always smiling, doormen always trying to help you and location is great, MSG around the corner and few minutes away of Empire State Building...deff going to come back.";5
We cannot speak more highly about this Riad and the staff. If there was a sixth star I could provide here I would.   Even before our arrival, the hotel reached out to us to arrange for ground transportation from the airport. We were greeted with luggage service, a warm welcome and breakfast even though it was well into the afternoon. The staff members were happy to guide us by foot to our various destinations and even gave us a local cell phone in case we got lost and needed their assistance to return to the hotel. The staff there is incredibly accommodating. They seemed to know when we had a late night the night before and would not disturb us in the morning. Breakfast is available anytime of the day you request. And it is included. The bar and really any service you require is;5
Nicely decorated modern hotel. Great location although due to proximity to Times Square it could be a little loud at times. Very clean and very spacious room for NYC. Walking distance to subway, restaurants, 5th Ave shopping, Times Square, Broadway and Central Park. Good wifi and very friendly staff. The bartender, Javier, was awesome. Reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the area. We stayed nearby at the Hilton on our last stay but chose the Ameritana this time due to increased prices - the Ameritana was better in all respects and for a one week stay was $1000 AUS cheaper!;5
The hotel staff was awesome, food was great, room was clean and comfy and the location was convenient to major attractions.  We will definitely consider staying at this hotel in the future.  The wait staff was on top of all of our requests.  The gym was also good for our needs.;5
My brother and I visited this hotel on a road trip from England - it was our last stay, we were very tired and exhausted from travel.  Elena and Majid were incredibly kind and welcoming to us both, and very much made us feel at home at the hotel, as well as giving advice about where to go in the city!  We were in a high room, so there was no traffic noise and the hotel is brilliantly located for Times Square and walking around the city as well as using the subway to visit downtown.;5
Stayed here for a weekend trip to NYC. Best location as you are close to MSG and Times Square. Old historic hotel that has been updated and provides wonderful service. Well worth the cost. After all you are in NYC!;5
The staff were very engaging when I first arrived, and did not hesitate to help with luggage. Very personable and friendly. The hotel was in such a great spot, with Central Park right outside, and great food spots around the area!;5
good location and very convenient and highly recommended to everyone wanting a short stay by the airport before the flight next day! and really appreciated the accommodations by the wonderful hotel staff and reasonable prices and walking distance to the airport;5
We stayed at the Riad for 3 nights last week and couldn't recommend it highly enough. The staff were all delightful and did their utmost to make our stay memorable, They always asked if we wanted to be accompanied when going out, as the little alleys are quite confusing for the first few trips. They gave excellent recommendations for restaurants, sights and itineraries for sight-seeing. The room was delightful and immaculately clean. The terraces have glorious views of the mountains and we really enjoyed the ability to order tea, coffee or cold drinks (included in the room rate) at any time. The breakfasts were delicious, and the meal they cooked for us on the first evening excellent. We can't wait to return!;5
Vlad set the tone with our initial meeting while checking in. He was professional, welcoming, and friendly! We felt special the minute we met Vlad and the rest of the team followed suit! I highly recommend the Ameritania Hotel!!!;5
Came in with my mate to the Hollywood Hotel for a 10 day stay. I can say I recommend it to everyone, rooms are big with 2 beds. Cheers to Pil at the front desk he can really make anyone feel really welcomed. Hotel has breakfast and pool and coffee for each guest. Love this hotel.;5
Although I don't live far from Universal City, when I go there I like to enjoy myself and there are only two hotels within walking/tram distance to Universal Studios, The Gibson Amphitheater and Universal Citywalk and those are the Hilton and Sheraton.    The Hilton is a beautiful hotel with views overlooking Hollywood, the freeway and Universal Studios and Citywalk.  The hotel is elegant, has a wonderful staff that even escorts you to the elevators and points out areas of interest suck as the bar/lounge, restaurant, a Starbuck's like coffee house and gift shop.  They have plenty of brochures on local area attractions and a concierge that is always helpful.  Our room was spacious and had beautiful with views of the Hollywood area and freeway as well as Universal Citywalk which;5
This was our second visit to the Empire and it was fabulous. On arrival we found they had upgraded us to a superior room with views of the Lincoln Centre. The staff were friendly and polite. They printed out our tickets for the ice hockey with no problems, weâve stayed in hotels before where theyâve charged us for this.  We were in New York for my 40th birthday and staying in this hotel really helped make it a trip to remember. On our return to NY, (hopefully next year!) we will definitely be staying in this beautiful hotel.;5
We were treated wonderfully!!! Recommend staying in an alcove room on a higher floor for the best view of Universal. Breakfast buffet was pricy but delicious. Awesome shuttle. Beautiful room, very clean & comfortable. Joining Hilton Honors gave us the best rates and sweet perks.;5
We were quite pleased with our stay at the Hollywood. Parking is gated and for customers only. I will say that I wish I knew ahead of time I would have to pay $26 a night for parking but I later realized this is much cheaper than most of LA. Our room was cozy and spacious and very clean. The free breakfast was impressive with made to order omelets and waffles. Super friendly staff. Location was great, near metro and other tourist attractions.;5
Great service by desk staff and concierge, Jeffrey.  Jeffrey set us up with transportation and great advice on nearby places to eat, etc. The room met our needs, bedding was great. Location was perfect.;5
I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Hollywood hotel has several advantages:  1- Very close to Universal Studious. 2- Close to Griffith Observatory. 3- One Bus ride to Santa Monica Beach ($1.75 only) 4- Hotel is clean and nice. 5- Their Breakfast is very good. Especially when 'Hugo' cooks your Omlete. He is doing excellent job. 6- Room service is doing their job very well. 7- I loved the smell of the Mango Shampoo they put in the toilet. 8- Hotel staff are friendly and polite. All of them smile to you whenever you encounter them.  On the other hand, here are some disadvantages:  1- Room Space is small. 2- Elevators are too slow 3- The Hotel's main door needs to be fixed.  At the end, the overall evaluation for the hotel is excellent. I will not hesitate to book at this hotel;5
"I stayed there for about 2 weeks. On the first night i had a very small room with no view (or on a wall...) because the hotel was fully booked, after that i could change for another room. That made a whole difference, the room was bigger, nicer, and with a beautifull view... The only thing i didn't like was the carpet everywhere like in many American hotels... The staff was professionnal and friendly. It's a hotel with a history, Nicola Tesla leaved there for about 10 years ! It's very well located on the 8th Avenue, next to Pen Station, very practical to reach the airport via the train. I really liked the fitness room ! Actually i have chosen this hotel because of it's nice and big fitness room. It has all (or almost all ;-)) the equipment you might need. It's opened 24h a day,";5
Had a suite with two double beds, a sitting area, and a rooftop terrace with a view of the Empire State Building. Definitely a period hotel, but we had a great experience. Would definitely stay here again. The rooftop terrace was a big hit!;5
Some friends and I came over Halloween weekend to celebrate their Birthdays. We flew into Newark and took the train to Penn Station, leaving us just 2 blocks from the hotel. The property itself is just steps from time square and Madison square garden.   We were checked in by Miguel and he was phenomenal. He immediately acknowledged the Birthday's in the group, mentioned he upgraded us, and sent up a bottle of champagne. If we needed anything throughout our stay, Miguel made sure it was executed immediately.   In order to access guest floors you must flash security your room key, this made us feel safe. The room was quite spacious which is not what you expect for a NYC hotel. The bathroom was tiny but manageable...shower was excellent. A friend used the fitness center and;5
Pil an Nelson have been the greatest help in my experience. I loved the 24 hour assistance. An warm hearted hospitality. The room was great the pool an Great fitness center. An laundryâs the maids where also amazing;5
The staff is super friendly and welcoming! The hotel is spotlessly clean and the breakfast is delicious! They make eggs to order, any style and they are cooked to perfection! The room is well designed and very cozy, bathrooms are beautiful, showers have great water pressure and also maintain water temperature very well (for those who like hot showers like me). Didnât get a chance to stop by the bar but saw it and it looked very nice and cozy. Location is a little far from the airport but itâs near West Hollywood and also close to all points of interest. The hotel provides a tour service with guideline tours which was amazing! They pick you up and drop you off at the hotel so no Uber is needed. Loved the fact that the tvâs have google cast tv so I was able to watch Netflix from;5
I just made a last minute check-in to the Empire Hotel after leaving an unsuitable hotel on the East Side.  The manager, AJ, was very nice and upgraded me to a corner suite for my troubles.  I've stayed at the Empire numerous times before with great service and am very pleased with my beautiful room!;5
This is a lovely quaint old Hollywood style hotel central to everywhere with the Metro Red Line just a block away.  In one direction, the metro takes you to the heart of Hollywood and beyond in just a few short stops.  In the other direction, it takes you straight to Union Station in downtown LA.  The rooms, although showing a little wear in some, are large comfortable and clean.  Some face out to a lovely little courtyard although if you prefer quiet, maybe book one on an upper floor away from the lobby.  The breakfasts are amazing as well as entertaining.  You can watch Chef Hugo do magic with any kind of omelet or waffle you want and always with a big smile thrown in.  Sonia is delightful and so helpful, friendly and sweet.  At first I thought the hotel was in a bit of a;5
This Riad is a beautifully decorated and well kept (clean) Riad.  The breakfasts are delicious, and the staff are amazing! I visited with 2 girlfriends and we were so upset to leave -  we would all definitely go back! I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Marrakesh but particularly to girls traveling alone as the Riad provide you with a Morocco phone when you go out and when you come back they will send a male member of staff to meet you and walk you back so you do not get bothered by the locals! A huge âthank youâ to all of the staff but particularly Valentina, Ismael, Abdul and Mohammed for making it a truly wonderful stay!;5
The second part first: I had twice confirmed with Hyatt reservations central that I was going to arrive in the morning after the check in day so that I could have a room as soon after I got off a long trans-Pacific flight that landed at 6:30 AM.  Somehow, my late arrival was never transmitted, so my suite was taken.  Immediately, reception put me in a room until my suite was ready, and the manager volunteered to pay for one of the two nights.  So much more honorable than yhe way the far more costly Ritz-Carlton Marina handled a check-in problem!   The hotel, I'm told, was just renovated, and the result is a slick (in the good sense of the word), hip modern looking hotel.    The restaurant is called Unity because it has food from the many different cultures of southern;5
Stopped in NYC for a few days for my birthday after our return flight from the Virgin Islands. Loved the cozy room, views, old style tiled bathroom, location, easy access to Times Square, subway and bus station. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definately stay again.;5
I wanted to make sure that I leave a positive review for Efron at the restaurant in the Hilton. Hia hospitality and kindness was like no other that I have experienced. The waitstaff was also very friendly and accommodating as well. We came here for my daughter's birthday and they gave her cotton candy and a piece of cake. They also sang happy birthday to her making it very special. Thank you so much for being so nice and patient with us;5
After searching for a room in Manhattan, I came across the reviews for the New Yorker, and SO glad I did!! Making online reservations (thru TripAdvisor) was a breeze, check-in on a Sunday afternoon took no time at all. Lynn at the desk upgraded our reservation to a larger room with a view of the Hudson River instead of a view of the next building. The room was spacious and clean, the mattresses are perfect for me, nice and firm. The bathroom was expectedly small and has older fixtures and tile- this hotel has been around for a while- but everything was clean and tidy, a plethora of towels was provided, the elevators are fast and smooth.  One very cool amenity, that is not advertised, is the location of the 74th and Penn Subway Station right across the street- I wish I had known;5
To the wonderful team at Riad Kheirredine  Thank you for making our postpone Honeymoon an amazing experience. We are so glad to have finally come after 2 years in the making  After being collected from the airport we were driven into the old city 'the medina'. We were greeted by the staff and had our bag trolley through the narrow alley ways. Once checked on we were served with a delicious breakfast. Our First night, the hotel arranged to have dinner for us on the rooftop terrance scatted with rose petals. I was amazed on how much the staff goes above and beyond for you. The Tagine was delicious  Each day we had breakfast in the rooftop to soak in the heat and the mountains views. The staff greeted us with big smile. I was surprised on how much goes in to taking care of the;5
If you want the real New York this is your hotel. Right in the middle of the action walking distance to Times Square the Empire State Building and most important Macysð couldnât of asked for a nicer hotel and more helpful staff. Rooms were beautiful and clean beds were huge to collapse into after a day of touring. I am always recommending people to stay here and we will definitely be staying on our next trip ð;5
I personally would like to thank Ms.Assia for her extraordinary costumer service she provided to our team where they could communicate 100% in French and enjoyed every minute of the stay. I recommend this hotel for most of French speakers visiting NYC for business or leisure again thank you Assia for all the efforts you did to our group;5
My partner and I stood here during our visit to New York, we were looking for some thing simple & close to the heart of the city and this location was it .The decor was lovely really modern, Red is my favorite color so the lobby did not disappoint. The front desk staff was very professional and every one was really nice, including the engineer who came to fix the ac (it was a hot New York week) and made conversation and suggested some areas we could visit in lower Manhattan, Adinson was very helpful. Overall we had a pleasant experience especially after the air conditioning was adjusted ! I would recommend the Ameritania to anyone looking to stay in the city, the pricing  was far especially for it proximity to Times Square.;5
"Great location for a late arrival from incoming or departure flight hotel. Shuttle service to and from LAX is prefect. Hotel staff really knows the value of service in a super friendly, fast and informative way. If you have an early bird outbound flight or late inbound this hotel really focus on the tired from travellers needs and convenience at a time when you really don't want to wait just crash in your hotel room bed. Love this hotel on three ground rules; location, staff and room quality. Just perfect!";5
"Last week marked my third annual stay at the New Yorker a Wyndham Hotel.  It is a large, lively, hotel that offers a boutique feel.  The hotel is steeped in history, boasting guests such as Joe DiMaggio, Muhammad Ali, and Nikola Tesla, who made the New Yorker his home for a solid decade.  Rooms are small, reflecting the time period in which the hotel was built; they are also extremely clean.  The wonderful staff are the heart and soul of the New Yorker.  This past week when I arrived I felt as if I was returning home.  I hope that next summer will mark my 4th annual trip.";5
We always stay here when we go to Universal Hollywood. Itâs a beautiful, clean and convenient hotel. The staff is excellent. And itâs an easy walk, or shuttle ride to Universal Studios. The rooms are updated and very spacious.;5
Great Service! Feels like coming home each time after visiting the hectic heart of Marrakech. Food is excellent too! Staff is there to help you. amazing view from the roof top, restaurant and pool. Will definitely come back;5
Great service, moving houses and had to extend my stay and Brian helped me really well last minute I could stay in the same room with my luggage etc. would def recommend to stay here if you are in LA, close to everything.   Michael;5
best stay and staff!!! the staff went out of there way to make my birthday and stay extra special. this is the way all hotels should function!! i will return to this hotel during our next visit to Universal Studios Hollywood!!Stewart u ROCK!!;5
The staff was wonderful and accommodating. The location could not have been better. Had the best room in the house that was on the corner of Broadway and 54th. Everybody have a smile on their face. Would definitely stay again.;5
Just back from four amazing nights at the Riad Kheirredine which if you want an authentic Marrakesh experience this is the Riad to stay at. Located at the North end of the Medina it is truly an oasis of calm amidst the mayhem that is the Medina with its narrow alleys full of stalls selling everything you can ever need. The Hotel itself is fabulous, the rooms are of the very highest quality and the staff lead by Valentina can not do enough for you comfort and well being. From organising a guided tour of the Souk (It was only 45 euros) and worth every penny as Sharif took you to places in the Souk that few tourists would venture, to providing you with a dedicated mobile phone to contact them at any time, to arranging restaurants for dinner and to arranging for staff to guide you;5
Does anybody have an email address for the Wyndham New Yorker hotel in New York, my wife and I stayed there 4 years ago and I would like to contact them. Our stay then was very enjoyable, the staff friendly and the Tick tick restaraunt for breakfast good.;5
My wife and I recently went on our honeymoon traveling the whole coast of California. Had an excellent time in LA at Universal Hilton. Staff went above and beyond making our stay memorable. Weâll definitely be back when weâre in LA again!;5
Seniors in transit facing very early flight at LAX needed a respite with little notice.Easy online res w/request for early checkin and quiet room. Arrived to cheerful professional reception with all requests honored and 4 complimentary waters. Hotel lobby is very cool, open and elevators waiting to our 11th floor king room. Very well appointed, immaculate and we had a comfortable overnight stay. Much care and many kindnesses were extended(extra blanket, room service, wake up call, luggage forwarded). We felt tested and well fortified to deal with LAX and are very happy to know this as our new choice in future travels.;5
Staff very helpful.  Clean rooms, great buffet, very comfortable beds. Awesome view and great access to Universal Studios.  Would definitely stay here again.  Come here to be within just steps of Universal and City Walk.;5
"Yes this hotel is in a not well lit alley, but upon arrival one will be handed a map with keypoints of how to find your way back. A member of the hotel will also walk with the guests to the souk and explain how to get back. He will point out a small square to where a taxi will bring you back. No taxi can reach  the front door of the hotel. We felt safe all the time;  on the souk and the big plaza we were not being hassled at all.mind you we are an elderly couple dressed quite conservative for the occasion and may not be attractive to be approached by ""sellers"".  It could be a different story for younger ladies in modern dress. Anyway the hotel is very recommendable, and our room was beautifully decorated by the Italian owners. The roof terrace is very relaxing. We found the";5
We stayed at the Ameritania from 20th November 2016 for 7 nights. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman and an equally frriendly reception staff who ensured a quick and smooth check in. We stayed in room 1203 which looked out over Broadway. The hotel is located at 350 West 54th Street on the corner of Broadway. It is very handy for Time Square (a 10 minute walk south down Broadway, Central Park (a 10 minute walk north up Broadway) and a 10-15 minute walk east to 5th Avenue. Our room was fairly quiet considering the business of the street below. The room was clean and spacious. the bathroom having a good shower and the usual complimentary toiletries. The bed was a queen size bed which was nice and comfortable with 4 pillows provided for 2 of us. The bedding was changed on;5
"Really, what more could you ask for in NYC for less than $90 a night? Yes, the rooms may be tiny but that is honestly the only ""negative"" about this place. staff is super helpful, give you new bottles of water each day, its located a stones throw from the Hudson, tons of cabs readily available a block away, subway access 5 minutes away, FREE WIFI that works great, NICE LCD TV, and more importantly, CLEAN CLEAN shared bathrooms. never had to wait for a shower or toilet. make sure to check out the Ballroom bar. I will be staying again!";5
So , I originally booked to stay here for 7 nights but I loved this hotel and decided to stay for three more ! In LA visiting my son so I chose a hotel with a pool for chilling while my son was at work. Distance to walk of fame is about 10 mins in an Uber which cost about 8 dollars or so, no biggie. This is a family run Hotel and the difference is huge when it comes to care and service The Hotel is spotless with the cleaners doing an impeccable job every day , thank you ladies The reception staff are really helpful and Pil in particular went above and beyond to make sure I got a great rate for my extended visit, thank you Pil and the other lovely receptionists. I need to mention the Chef, He makes by and far the BEST omelettes and waffles for breakfast , handling a whole room of;5
"The Ameritania at Times Square is a wonderfully unique hotel with a caring staff and great accommodations.  It's location on 54th and Broadway made all of the theater district accessible while being a little ""off the beaten path"" made it a quiet oasis after a busy day of theater and sightseeing. The Ameritania will be at the top of my places to stay list for my next trip to New York.";5
I just attended the Infinite Campus Interchange. This was my third stay but my husbands first trip to the city.  Before we arrived I informed them that it was his first visit to the city and I would be gone during the day and I would love him to have a view.  They gave us an amazing room with an amazing view.  Iâve never had a bad trip. I donât usually hit the restaurants but rather hit the little spots to grab a bite.  He absolutely loved everything about the hotel and the trip. Looks like he will join me again next year.;5
Sarah and the staff gave us a warm welcome !! Room clean , bathroom excellent!!! .   Main lobby well maintained and clean!   The location of the hotel is excellent cause we visit a lot of sightseeing in Manhattan   Will come again!!!!thanks Sarah;5
I've stayed at this hotel twice and really have no complaints, other than the price of the parking is a bit steep. Clean, good service and friendly staff, comfortable rooms (spacious), good breakfast. For people complaining about location, this is something you should check before you go, if the location does not fit your plans then choose something closer to where you're going!;5
My wife and I had a wonderful 3 day stay - very friendly and attentive staff, good food and very comfortable.  Situated in the medina where you are supplied with a mobile phone should you get lost but we had no problems.  Lovely roof garden for eating, relaxing or sun bathing. Thank you;5
In our trip was a great surprise to find and stay at this special guest house. It has been annamazing experience!! All the personel was deficated to attend the guests with warm and love. The room incredible couzy. The food at the Riad was the best in town. Excellent guest house!!;5
Stayed multiple nights in November, 2014 while traveling on business.  Stayed in a corner King room. Very spacious, clean, and updated.  Bed was great, bathroom was huge, absolutely no complaints. Loved the room.  Had a great view.  Hotel breakfast buffet was great, cooked to order and other items.  Location was great if you are visiting Universal.  Was a 5 minute easy walk to the park.  There is a shuttle to the part as well, but it's not needed.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  I recommend this hotel especially if you are visiting Universal Studios.;5
My family and I stay her often while my son received treatment at CHLA. We always receive great customer service from the staff.  In particular, Nicole has always provided us with exceptional, personalized service.  We will continue to stay here!;5
Nice hotel, beautiful lobby, there's a little cafe there and the food was actually really good.  Room was nice, bed was comfy, there is valet parking and a parking garage.  Parking is very expensive, but that's par for the course for LA. I got my room key on their app on my phone!;5
I decided to return to the New Yorker hotel after staying here two weeks prior to my visit. It was selected at first because of its location, just a few blocks away from where I was working. I stayed in an executive queen room on the 39th floor (after I was given a double room by mistake), and it was spacious and had a spectacular view. I could see the Statue of Liberty from my room!   I did not use any of the facilities (fitness and business centers), but I did make a trip down to the bottom floor to see them. The fitness center seemed larger than your typical hotel fitness center.  The staff was friendly and accommodating. I felt safe in the neighborhood. It was a quick walk to meet friends around Times Square. Added bonus: the artists from Ink Master were staying at the same;5
The hotel is in a prime location and is a well maintained hotel. All the staff I came into contact with were all very friendly . The room I had was 3329 on the 33rd floor but there are plenty of lifts. The room was quite small with a double bed and double glazing which is needed in New York, the room and bathroom very clean, great shower, the view was of other high rise buildings.There is an Italian restaurant on the ground floor Dmitri was a pleasure to be served by and even had time to interact with me and includes a bar. Also there is an American type Dinner Bar, food very good at both these locations.I would recommend this hotel to anybody.;5
"Room was small but very efficient for the two of us. Only problem we had, which is usually not a complaint, is getting cold water!!! Location was great - close proximity to Times Square, Subway, and much more. The Tick Tock Diner connected to the hotel is reasonably priced and you get ample food (had lunch and breakfast there). Butcher Banker Steakhouse was one of the best meals we had! Used their driver to get to the airport; he was a good driver and very friendly.";5
Hotel was very nice. Amenities were excellent. It can be a little difficult to find, but otherwise the property was very modern. Although it is near the airport, you couldn't hear anything. The staff was very friendly.;5
Booking the Hollywood Hotel was the right decision. It is centrally located, the rooms are clean and very big and the breakfast is perfect for American standards. The staff were very friendly to us. We would recommend this hotel in any case and book again. Thank you for everything!!!;5
We stay here every time we come to Los Angeles. The location is great if you're flying in late or leaving early the next day. The quality & service make it worth it stay near LAX and schlep into the city or out to the destinations for the day. The rooms are updated, clean, and comfortable.  They were testing the backup generators the day we arrived and the team were great at communication. They clearly told us what to expect and when, and they sent one staff member to each floor to support guests during the test.;5
Stayed here over the Summer and have to say we had the most pleasant experience! From the helpful staff (especially Jose G at checkin!) , to the beautiful room, to the incredible rooftop! Will definitely be back.;5
A huge surprise! This hotel is probably about 1000 yards from a major runway at LAX. I never heard a thing.It was one of the most relaxing hotels stays I ever had. The room was most relaxing and the rate was quite reasonable. Highly recommended!;5
I stay here on average once a week or every 10 days for work. I really love it. Evan and the staff is great and always helpful, even when i feel like a pest for often requesting a slightly later checkout. The rooftop bar is a fun, with great drinks and music. An all-around enjoyable experience, each and every time.;5
My wife and l came here to get away from the kids . We had a great time and the accommodations were fantastic . Staff was incredible. One employee in particular Nancy went out of her way to make our stay more pleasurable .  We will recommend the place to friends and family;5
I travel for my work, am on the road a quarter of the year, and have been doing that for the past fifteen+ years. One of my favorite hotels is the Morningside Inn. What makes it so great is 1) the location â in Manhattan, convenient to everything, yet tucked away on the quiet Upper West Side, 2) the prices â you just canât beat their very modest rates compared with other places, 3) the accommodations â quiet, clean, comfortable, and well kept, and 4) the management & staff â especially the manager, and the meticulous housekeepers. The place is just the best. Iâm there 3-4 times a year, and never ceased to be both amazed and satisfied with the quality and moderate cost of the place.;5
Beautiful hotel.  King corner room on 17th floor was very quiet, clean, and nice sized with great view of the hills and Universal Studios.  The staff at all levels was friendly, helpful, and always cheerful.  The hotel was full for the Rose Bowl, but service was still excellent.  We would definitely stay there again.;5
Nice modern rooms with great views. Across the street from Universal Studios Hollywood. Great restaurant with wonderful food and if your lucky you might even see a movie star while staying there. Popular place to hang out.;5
This was an excellent place to stay during my visit to NYC. I have absolutely nothing negative to say. The view, the rooms, the staff, the food and most importantly the bars. It made an already awesome weekend romantic. The rooftop bar is a must!  The Happy Couple;5
great hotel and great location! It was a great overall experience but the best was the room. It was huge, like a suite! And clean, nice and comfortable beds. We'd definitely do that again...  Family from Sweden;5
Fabulous hotel and a five minute walk from Universal Studio! Gorgeous rooms, Breakfast in the restaurant was good, there was a good buffet for a reasonable price. Seafood buffet on weekend nights was a great deal for $49!;5
A family stay for four nights and this premier inn was ideally suited. The breakfast was well managed and always a good choice with so many people each morning, rooms very good size and as usual excellent beds. If you wanted a room clean it needed to be requested or you could get clean towels from room attendant. Close by some excellent eating places and good shops, good bar with realistic prices.;5
Mr. Ze upgraded our reservation to a delux room. I will come back and stay here. Next to Lincoln center. 8 minutes ride to time square by subway. In close proximity to central park. Surrounded by restaurants.;5
My husband and I stayed here after we returned from a cruise to go to Universal Studios on Nov 16-17.  We arrived at 10am and was greeted by Stewart.  We have never received such great service at a hotel. He checked us in right away.  He was very friendly and told us about the area and also recommended the prime rib and seafood buffet at Cafe Sierra.  We had an alcove room.  The room was great.  It was spacious and clean, the bed was very comfortable.   We decided to take Stewart's recommendation and try the buffet.  It was amazing!! The food was overwhelming and everything was delicious.  When we checked out the next morning Stewart was there again and inquired about our stay.  We ended up talking for a while. My husband and I talked for quite some time on our way back to;5
Solo trip in May 2018. Excellent service and quality of the Hotel and personnel. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone interested in viewing the Los Angeles area, and/or tours of the movie and television studios.;5
There are some occasions when 5 stars are not enough and this Riad in the older part of Marrakech is certainly deserving of more.   It is approached by a small alleyway from the narrow maze of lanes of the Medina and once you pass through the unpretentious wooden entrance door you step into its beautiful inner courtyard with the soft sound of the water playing in the fountains.   The Riad team greet you like long lost friends and are eager to assist you in any way possible to ensure that your stay with them is comfortable and safe,  For us they made reservations and many recommendations  to find the best of Marrakech adding to our special time.  The Riad is furnished in the older elegant Moroccan style with alcoves and sitting areas scattered around with little stairways and;5
Gorgeous room, very, very comfortable bed and lovely view (my room looked out to Lincoln Center, I could see the Metropolitan Opera House from my window!).   I have stayed in plenty of hotels in NYC and the Empire is by far one of the nicest I have experienced. The restaurant is not bad either. Friendly staff at both the front desk and the restaurant. Only 4 stars for the rest. review because they didn't have many vegetarian options. FYI, if you like Starbuck's, there is one right next to the hotel.   Just two little things:  the bathroom was a tad small (not a big deal, it is NYC after all) and had that single paned glass shower door which can make for a mess in the bathroom, 2) the internet connection in the business center was so slow that I could not access my email at all.;5
We arrived after a long trip from the UK into the Wyndham New Yorker. Check in was fast. The receptionist took our passports and realised it was my partners 40th birthday while staying at the hotel. They upgraded us to a city view (very nice touch) we were amazed. We went up to our room on the 36th floor, pulled the curtains open and WOW! The Empire State Building was right in front of us. It was amazing! We could also see Maddison Square Garden.  The rooms are kept clean at all times. We speak more time in ours room than we would of liked due to New York doing into lock down due to Covid-19. The decor is art decor and in places, looks amazing, but in some parts, needs updating and looking after.  We ate in ten Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel a couple of times. The food;5
This is our fourth time staying here and everytime we love it. Not only are the staff extremely helpful and friendly but the facilities are wonderful and the location superb. We can not rate this place high enough. Universal City Walk is a quick 5 minute walk away, or there is a shuttle should you prefer, so there is always something to do in the evenings that don't require you hopping in the car.   Whenever we are travelling to LA, we now always stay here.;5
i needed a budget option for the last few days of my trip and could not be more impressed with The Jane. Location is perfect for hanging out in the meatpacking and west village areas, subway 10mins walk so easy to get around. Staff were welcoming and helpful, the shared facilities were kept spotless and no issues with waiting for a shower. the bar is a great place to hang out too, seemed a bit of a west village hotspot. I was there for four nights and would have happily stayed longer, yes the rooms are small (I had a single cabin) but there is underfed storage and hooks on the wall for hanging your stuff up, so I didn't find it space an issue at all.  This was my fourth trip to NYC and my first time staying at the Jane, would fully recommend it regardless of budget, its a cool;5
We stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for 4 nights. It was my first time in New York. We travelled by subway from JFK cost $8 compared to $80-$100 for taxi and it was probaly quicker too. To my surprise the hotel was only a block away from where we exited the subway. First impressions were great. We were greeted by the door staff and shown to the check in desk. Staff were very informative and friendly and we were given our room. We had room 219 which was an inner facing room with no view. Not a problem really though I suppose a view would be nice. It was clean and adequate, the bathroom was also clean and shower was surprisingly big. Room was clean and towels changed daily. There was a mini bar which we didn't use. The room had a safe which we did use. Aircon worked well and the bed;5
Myself and my boyfriend recently stayed here for three nights. We both travel frequently, and until now have never felt it necessary to write a Tripadvisor review - having  never experienced such flawless service as that witnessed at Riad Kheirredine!   There is just something magical about this place. Having never been to Morocco before, we wanted to experience a traditional riad over a generic hotel. As mentioned in previous comments, the old part of the city is like a maze, and subsequently all the riads are tricky to locate. However, this riad went above and beyond their call of duty to overcome this by providing complimentary escorts to and from the accommodation. The mobile phones they provide are also extremely useful and alleviate any other issues when away from the;5
If youâre looking for luxury itâs not for you. If youâre looking for comfortable and welcoming itâs perfect. Perfectly situated surrounded within easy walking distance from Penn station, Macyâs, Times Square,  Empire State and Madison sq garden.  The beds are fantastically comfortable and thereâs a diner and bar in the hotel for a convenient bite of breakfast or a bedtime drink...... what more would you need? Would definitely book here again on another trip.;5
Hotel was much better than expected! Location location location. Right next to universal studios and citywalk... so super convenient if you have kids... As a hilton honors member the breakfast perks were awesome!  Cannot beat this hotel if visiting hollywood or universal studios... The managers made all of my request happen, so I was extremely pleased. High floor, check Great breakfast, check Walk across street to parks, check Thank you hilton;5
Stayed at the hotel for a convention.  Room was beautiful and clean.  Regency Club was so worth the money.   Food and drink choices far exceed other hotels I have stayed at.  All staff I had interactions with were very nice.;5
2 friends and I stayed at The New Yorker for a weekend getaway trip, and had a great time. The room, and bathroom were both clean, and housekeeping did a great job during our stay. The staff was professional, helpful, and pleasant. The view from the upper floors was great, and it's a relatively short walk to the Empire State Building. They were even able to accommodate a special request - one of my friends really wanted to stay in the Tesla room, and they made it happen! We ate at the Tick Tock Diner for breakfast 2 of the days during our stay, and had good experiences there both mornings as well (good food, good staff). Overall I would highly recommend the New Yorker.;5
Over the Easter Holidays, we stayed at Riad Kheirredine and were treated like Kings and Queens from start to finish. My personal stand-outs include:  1. Genuine hospitality from the moment you book your accommodation. They were very prompt in responding to all my emails ahead of the trip, and so quick to help me book restaurants (Al Fassia, Comptoir Darma) and bars (Nomad) for our evening outings - thank you Elena and Valentina for the recommendations! During our stay, every staff member greeted you warmly with a big smile on their face and were always interested in engaging in a long conversation.   2. Never felt unsafe. They provide you with a mobile phone which gives you a 24/7 hotline to a staff member, which served as a nice little safety blanket. The only time we used it;5
Great location close to LAX.  Shuttle service to and from the airport. Clean and modern rooms. Very kind and attentive staff throughout. The Bar in the lobby is the only source of food in the hotel at night and menu/ food was surprisingly good. On the other hand, the Starbucks in the lobby ran out of food early in the afternoon which doesn't leave one with many choices.;5
This was my second time to stay in teh Ameritania hotel and I will without hesitation return for further visits. The locationn is perfect, the rooms and amenities are of a high standard and importantly all the staff are helpful, friendly, good mannered and generally just make the stay a warm experience.Looking forward to my next stay.;5
Okay - let's get it out there right at the start of this review. We had seven nights in a double bunk cabin and it is TINY - the floor space is about the size of the bunk or a bit smaller. It's a good job we like each other, because every movement in the room has to be carefully choreographed. However, we knew that before we arrived - we had done our research and it was no surprise.  Having taken that on board, all you have to do is skim through the reviews already written and pick out all the best bits. Price, old world charm, the wonderful/nothing too much trouble staff, the prime Greenwich Village location, the cleanliness/slippers and bathrobes/wifi etc. etc. The bathrooms are brilliant - big chunky showers with unlimited hot water - and you rarely meet anyone in there. We;5
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel from July 24 to August 4 (11 nights). We couldn't of asked for a better hotel. We were greated by such kind staff working at the front desk. Cecile was the first one we met and she made us feel so welcome. We stayed on the first floor is room 116 (renovated room) with huge shower. The hotel is perfectly located very close to the metro station (Santa  Monica/Vermont) which was so handy, it brought us to basically everything we wanted to see..the metro pass also works on the bus which is very pratical if ever u get tired of walking.   The rooms are VERY clean and the hotel provides GREAT maid service. The maids are all so friendly. We always left them a tip, but even without a tip, the rooms are just as clean.   The whole hotel/grounds are always;5
"I'll start with the location.. It's just perfect! Just next door to Lincoln Center, on the corner of 63rd street. Central Park is a one block away, Columbus Circle is 5 min walk and so is 5th Ave & Central Park corner. Couple of Subway station are very close. We used the one on Columbus Circle (Lines A-B-C-D-1) which was 3 blocks away, but there's a closer one across the street at Lincoln Center (Lines 1-2-3). Starbucks & Duane Reade are next door and DR is open 24 hours! Huge selection of restaurants all around the neighborhood. You can have breakfast at the hotel ($26 PP for the hot breakfast buffet), but during our 3 night stay, we had a great breakfast on the corner of 57th & Columbus at a place called ""The Flame Restaurant"" (5-7 minute walk).  As we were 2 ADT + 2 kids we";5
The Ameritania's location was ideal for us in selecting the hotel but the friendliness of all of the staff sealed the deal.  A minor problem with access to wi-fi was corrected easily by the front desk staff and otherwise no problems were encountered.  A request to change the check-out time to one hour later was quickly accepted.  The hotel is clean and the room comfortable.  We will definitely stay there again.;5
Riad Kheirredine were the most welcoming and generous hotel I have ever experienced and this includes 5 star hotels. The staff went out of their way to tend to our needs, going to the extend of having staff walk us to areas we were unsure of and lending us a local mobile. The Riad was very well designed and the rooms lovely - with a fantastic breakfast.;5
This is my second time at this hotel. Must remark the change for good!! I received an executive room completely renovated. Beds comfortable and clean. The lobby is stunning The staff is very friendly, and the location is near to everything  Totally recommend!;5
Very nice hotel centrally located in Times Square and only a few blocks from the theatre district and good restaurants. Rooms were small but clean. Quiet hotel wit a comfortable lobby with lots of seating. Continental breakfast was included and had several selections to choose from. Staff friendly and courteous. We especially enjoyed Jeff who was delightful. He was friendly with a good sense of humor. Made us feel welcome and was very helpful in giving directions and pointing us in the direction of the subways instead of expensive cabs. Would definitely stay there again.;5
This is the place you want to stay.  My wife and I did a lot of research online (using trip advisor and booking.com) to find the right hotel in Marrakesh.  From the beginning to the end of our vacation the service was amazing.  Here are the highlights.  1.  The staff will pick you up at the airport and take you to the hotel 2.  Ishmal will take you to the square and will help get your oriented with the city since it is a challenge to get through there. 3.  The hotel will give you a curtesy cell phone in case you get lost or have a question. 4.  The free breakfast at the hotel is outstanding. 5.  The Staff will do everything they can to make your stay perfect.   6.  Very good price per night.   Their are a lot of great hotels in the city but what we liked about this hotel was the;5
Excellent time and service was fantastic everyone made you feel at home- The rooms very confortable and alot of space..Room service quick and good, and the staff in general extremely polite and efficient. Free shuttle to the park and City street , and the bar and restuarants very good.;5
Nice hotel with a convenient location.  Reasonable price, nice size room. Friendly and helpful staff. There's a nice bar in the hotel and a great variety of restaurants within two blocks,  many of them on the same block. Convenient to Times Square and to subway stations.  Great stay.;5
Great Hotel, Clean Rooms, Comfy Bed. Close to everything!! Quiet and cosy. Awesome Rates. Shuttle Bus Service available for airport transfers, Most tours pick up from the front of the hotel.  Recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to explore Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Hollywood Boulevard, Downtown LA and surrounds as there is Train Stations and Buses within walking distance.;5
The cook Hugo is awesome,always cheerful and very good Cook  Thank you!!!!!  We are having a great time in L.A. Friendly staffs at the Hotel,I would choose the same Hotel in the future!!!  Rosanne & Johnny Montreal,Canada;5
Twice a year every New York City fashion girl prepares for a whirlwind of shows, parties and FASHION. Since the shows moved to Lincoln Center the Empire Hotel has been the place I go to the most between shows to speak with my fellow fashion colleagues, relax and take in all the excitement of fashion week.   I am so looking forward starting this week to doing just that. The lobby bar at the Empire has got to be one of the best places to congregate during fashion week. Not only is the setting impressive but they always have something fashion related going on. I can go there during the day and get work done before I go to the shows and at night I can enjoy one of their amazing cocktails and other yummy things on their menu.   Aside from the great ambiance I'm also looking forward;5
Back again in the area. Excellent stay in the hotel. Outstanding friendly and helpful staff at the front desk, very nice room (same as I had before). Hoter and rooms in excellent condition. Breakfast buffet great, the staff there is very friendly and does a excellent Job, always.;5
The New Yorker was built in 1928 so the. Art deco feel is apparent. The thing that sets this hotel apart from other mid town Manhatten hotels is  the customer service.  Mohammed checked us in early and upgraded us to a window view , larger room. The $45.00 a night added charge for incidentals  is small compared to the quality , and additional amenities. Mohammed definitely provided exemplary customer service;5

I was really impressed with this place. On arrival the man at reception was very polite and helpfull. The room was alot bigger than I expected, with a sink, wardrobe, desk and fridge. We had a twin room with shared bathroom facilities, the showers were OK (clean), but for what you pay for this place you cannot complain! The hostel is only a 15 minute tube ride away from the centre of London and the hostel iteself is a 2 minute walk from the hammersmith tube station. My only critizism of this place would be that is it currently being converted from the hospital it once was, meaning there was scaffolding outside or window so on a hot day I didnt really want to leave the window open. And we were awoken at about 9 in the morning by building work. But I would definately reccomend;5
My wife and I would like to thank Raluca and her team for making our stay at premier inn London County Hall, from the 30th December 2022 to 2nd January 2023. We celebrated my birthday and nye within our stay.   I can imagine that this was the busiest time of the year for Raluca and her team, and they all managed to be there for us to make our stay the best.   We have stayed in a lot of Premier Inn hotels up and down the Country, this been one of the best!  Raluca and her team gave 110% and are a credit to Premier Inn.  We will be returning to celebrate again at the end of 2023 with family.;5
Hey , The hotel is amazing for being a airport property hotel, you have shuttle service back and forth to airport , There is a pool nice one a Gym a big pantry restaurant and a bar for great socializing time.;5
I was in town on business.   Everyone from the front desk to the maintenance staff worked to solve a few problems that came up.  Anthony at the Bell Desk was especially helpful beyond his usual duties.  I also was pleased that they had a reception for holders of Hilton Honors.  I have stayed at Hilton's for a numbers of years, and this is the first time a hotel had done that.;5
I have stayed in this hotel 3 times and I must say each time was a great experience. From the the moment I stepped out of the cab and greeted by the bellhops, great vibes and even more when greeted by the front desk. I have had the chance to have the same guy check me in. His name is Tony Gonzalez and he made me feel not like a guest but like a relative to the Wyndham family. I actually got a chance to visit the Nikola Tesla room on the 33rd floor as well on my last visit, way cool.;5
Would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are fantastic and so helpful especially Majid and Adam who met us with a smile at reception. This hotel is very clean. The beds are very comfortable. The location is fantastic - very central. Perfect base for exploring New York!;5
Reading the reviews got me a little concerned about our stay but it was amazing from the moment we walked into reception to be Told we had been upgraded to a suite! The suite was spotless clean and plenty of room and storage. The fridge was very welcome! As for the bed well it shows how brilliant it was as we have come home and bought a bed very similar! We called it the cloud as it was like sleeping on one. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. We had read about the lifts taking a long time to come but we never experienced any delays at the lift bank. I wouldnât change a thing about the hotel it is in a great spot very handy for the subways and trains and I would stay here again in a heartbeat thank you the New Yorker;5
Our stay for the weekend was amazing.very overpriced at the restaurant inside the hotel.everything else was great.the pool area could use some new things around the area.the person at the time of check in was very helpful.I thought both my husband and I had honors member benefits.I signed up when I returned home.I live the shuttle service to and from universal.great trip for my family for a weekend.;5
Good amenities and service.  Bell service employees are very gracious and professional.  Always smiling and ready to assist.  The food available is great and prices are reasonable.  Staff at the front desk are cordial and polite and always makes you feel comfortable.  They will recognize you as being a member of the Hyatt Club and ask if there is anything they could do for us while staying with them.;5
Stayed for four nights at this hotel.  It is large and impersonal but has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  We were disappointed that the shuttle service to City Walk ended very early. We walked back to the hotel at 11 pm with no problems but would have much preferred a shuttle. The location can't be beat. Food prices at the hotel were somewhat high but City Walk offers many restaurant choices from fast food to full service and a multi-screen cinema.  Walking down the hill to the red line subway is easy and quick. The rooms are clean and the bathroom was large.  We stayed on the highway side but did not hear much noise.  The elevators were often full--due to conventions.  A billing error was taken care of efficiently at the front desk. Adrian at the concierge desk was;5
Fantastic hotel for Universal Studios and great staff all round. The Universal breakfast was fantastic and the evening seafood and prime rib buffet was outstanding quality and value for money. We have never seen so much King Crab at a buffet and it was succulent and never ending.;5
We stayed for five nights from 19 November. The hotel is a three star plus and on first impressions I felt slightly disappointed bower this was down to my expectations being too high and being tired from the flight. I was expecting a larger room as everything in America is bigger (I have stayed in other hotels in America) however this is a city hotel and it represented the price we paid. On arrival we were greeted by Jeff the doorman who held the doors open for us, check in was quick and we were soon in our room. The bed was very comfortable, there was a dressing table, Otto an and built in wardrobe with safe. The bathroom was compact with hardly any room to store our toiletries however toiletries are supplied, nice big walk in shower which had a constant supply of hot water.;5
As everyone in the reviews has warned, the rooms are very small. However, as we were only looking for somewhere to sleep all we really needed was a bed and a place to leave our stuff, so this hotel was just the ticket.  For the price I'd say it's great value for money - everywhere is very clean (the bathrooms are spotless!) and it's perfectly located. Also, depending on your taste I'd say the style is wonderful, it really is like being in a ship's cabin in a Wes Anderson movie. I absolutly loved it!  We experienced no problems with noise or the shared bathrooms being too busy (there was always several showers and toilets free). The attached restaurant is also very quirky with good food which is a bonus.  The only problem with the entire stay was that our door was left slightly;5
We stayed for 5 nights this July 2014 and can barely think of anything less than glowing and positive to say! This was our second stay (first was in March 2011 which was also our first trip to NYC). I didn't review the Empire previously, so here is my super wordy review to make-up for it.   I booked this July visit months ago as part of a birthday present for my boyfriend, through an external travel website, bookit.com, as a combination with our flight, and made a point of sending the hotel a couple of e-mails in advance, requesting that they do anything they could to make the stay special for us - a room with a view, away from the elevators, etc. The staff responded to my messages promptly with confirmation of the request (good communication!)  We arrived with our suitcases;5
The staff is very friendly, the place is clean, they keep you luggage if the room is not ready and when your flight is late at night they can keep your luggage there while you visit. Our room was pefect. The lobby is fabulous. You are near a subway entrance and walking distance from a lot of activities,;5
Recently traveled to New York for a business trip.  Excellent location to Times Square.  Javier the bartender was outstanding.  Great recommendations of eating and tourist attractions. Room was great, staff extremely attentive.;5
Amazing, really enjoyed my stay. What is great is itâs so easy to access the airport with their shuttle. Also the rooms are very clean. Being here makes it so easy to stay especially when you need to connect to the airport.;5
We stayed here for two weeks in the spring of 2012. The area surrounding the hotel at first looks a little sketchy, however looks can be decieving, especially if you're not familiar with LA. This hotel is great. It has a gated parking lot, a secluded beautiful pool, and a very nice breakfat buffet. The rooms were small, but very nice. The area is more than I could hope for. It's very close to hiking trails in the Hills, great authentic restaurants, area attractions, and even the subway if you chooce not to drive downtown. We booked this hotel because it was close to a friend, but we definately return for the reasons I listed above. It has some real beauty within it's lower level, the back fountains and pool, and the mid atrium is secluded and relaxing. Trust me, it's worth the;5
We arrived at 10am in the morning to Marrakech airport and were greeted by the airport transfer that Riad Kheirredine arranged to pick us up. As soon as we got to the entrance of the windy road the Riad was down (no cars can drive down them), we were met by the amazing Ismael who brought our bags to the hotel for us.   We were then immediately given a beautiful Moroccan breakfast by the pool and the staff were there for anything we needed. They showed us to our room (which they upgraded for free to an incredible suite) and Valentina, the Riad manager invited us down for Moroccan minty lemonade to tell us a bit about the Riad and what was included and to give us a bit of advice about what to do in Marrakech.  On our first day, we decided to venture into the winding maze that is;5
me and my wife came here for part of our honeymoon the hotel was perfect great location and a very nice room the hotel even gave us a free upgrade to our room as a good gesture was really nice of them overall the hotel was great ! Thanks all at the empire for a great stay and the great room !;5
Love this hotel, love to go back again.  Front desk service was over and above.  Also bell service excellent.  Beautiful stylish room.  Very nice breakfast with a view and great service. My daughter and had a wonderful stay !;5
We used the Hollywood Hotel for a unit and crew  base while filming a documentary in LA. The staff were very helpful and the facilities more than served our purpose while staying in the good sized and well equipped rooms. The location was ideal for accessing all the studios and attractions LA has to offer.  Jason Shepherd - Producer;5
We stayed here 4 days and were very happy with our choice.   Our room was small but we expected that since we were in New York.  The beds were very comfortable. Air conditioning was great.  None of us liked the bathtub water faucets as they were probably the originals and hard to turn.  The bathroom was tiny but functional.  There is no fan in the bathroom so it got really foggy every time we took shower. The location is excellent.  Everything is near by.  It is a 6 blocks walk to Time Square but that is nothing in New York as the walk is fun.  This location is 1 block away from Macy's, H&M, may big stores so my kids were very happy.  The Korean town is only 2 blocks away so we were able to try out Korean food.  A CVS with grocery, Starbuck and McDonald are right across the;5
Great value for money, excellent location and very friendly staff. We had a room on the 32nd floor for three nights and had a lovely view towards the Hudson. The room was very clean if a little dated but for the money and location we would definitely recommend it.;5
The hotel was clean, bright, and the secure.  Three things that can make or break a trip.   The staff was friendly and super helpful.  I ordered room service one night and while the order was incorrect I give them an A for service and delivery.  The bar service and menu were varied.  The breakfast bar is pricey at $35.00 for all you can eatâbut I guess thatâs to be expected in LA.  Overall, I would stay at the Hyatt again.;5
Great service , costumer service was great no problems checking in , very nice people very clean and nice rooms , loved my stay gym and pool was open nice pool nice views nice area , ver quiet and very nice people;5
So when I booked this room, I believe it was only a few dollars (under $10 maybe) to book a room above the standard room. Well I'm so glad I did. I haven't stayed in the standard room, but our room was fantastic! Large, spacious bathroom with granite. Large room with comfy bed and couch. We had a corner room so we had plenty of windows and the view was nice. Walking distance to Universal and City Walk. The staff was friendly. After this stay I chose to sign up with HHonors, because I really enjoyed our experience. I thought the parking was a tad pricey, but we expected it.;5
Overall great experience. Wished the room was on a higher floor but overall nice room. The hotel was close to Universal studios, walking distance. So we we didnt want to wait on the shuttle the kids and I were able to walk to and from the walkway. Upon leaving, the front desk clerk Nancy was extremely helpful and kind. Hope her and her two children have a lovely holiday.;5
Excellent hotel, maybe could do with a new carpet but he ho who cares about that, the staff are very friendly, the restaurants are first class, food is beautiful could not fault it, would definately stay in this hotel again and it was in an excellent location for the attractions;5
1.  Free Wifi service. 2.  Free shuttle to Universal Studios or take a 10 minute stroll thru the walkway. 3.  Online check-in and the room digital key which is a feature of the Hilton Honors app is very convenient and eliminates the hassle of lining up at the front desk to check-in.;5
We booked the New Yorker View Suite room and was not disappointed. We were on the 30th floor and could see the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden out of the windows. The suite had recently been refurbished so was very fresh and clean. We were impressed with the size of the bedroom, living room and kitchen. The bathroom was luxurious and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.;5
The location is perfect for shopping and across the street from Madison Square Gardens! Our suite was very clean, comfortable and quite spacious. We all enjoyed the lovely lounge and the Tic Tock for anytime dinning was superb! The staff were super friendly and very accommodating. We checked in a few hours early and planned to check our bags as we have done for many years at hotels all over the city and were very disappointed to be charged $5 for each bag. Never had this been an issue until now but someone was nice enough to tell us we could pay extra for an early check in that was must less expensive as checking all of our bags! We had a wonderful experience and are looking forward to our next stay at The New Yorker a Wyndham Hotel!;5
We got here at 10pm at night with a 2 year old.  We had just booked a room that night, and our request for an upgrade was no doubt aggressive.  But the front desk was very friendly, and worked hard to find us an amazing room with some space between the crib and bed.  When I got back from a long work day and wanted to spend some time at a Universal City dinner, albeit my parking for the night before had expired, another front desk staff member kindly accommodated the extended parking.  It just seems that at every turn where the choice was to help or just decline with a smile, they stepped up and delivered.  This is easily one of my most preferred hotels after many stays there while in Los Angeles.  Not to mention, the accommodations just feel nice and not dated. Oh, and not to;5
I would just like to thank the hotel, especially Neida for the telephone help I received prior to my daughter trip to New York. Information about transportation for the airport was precise easily understood. Thank you;5
A good place to stay with access to the Lincoln Center, Fordham University, and many restaurants. This is an old building that has been renovated quite well. I enjoyed a junior suite that had an excellent corner view. I enjoyed the rain shower head.;5
Last January me and my mother spent a very relaxing and comfortable week in this lovely Riad and we enjoyed it very much! It's been an unforgettable treat that we'll definitely repeat as soon as possible! All members of the staff are really kind, friendly and always ready to help. They provide a very efficient pick up and drop off service from and to the airport that comes really handy, especially when your flight lands at midnight.  The Riad is in the heart of the Medina, but it is very peaceful and quiet, the perfect place where to relax after a walk in vibrant Medina.  Being in the heart of a maze of little streets, there will always be a member of the staff ready to take you closer to Jama El fâna square and walk you back to the Riad without getting lost. For the same reason;5
Stayed here for 4 nights with friends on a recent trip to New York. We booked the hotel through a package deal with virgin holidays.  I emailed ahead and requested rooms with a view as our party were celebrating a birthday and we were given excellent rooms (3318) with views of the empire state, Chrysler building AND Madison square garden from our window!!!  Jessica on the reception desk was particularly helpful so Thankyou!  The hotel itself is a little tired around the edges, carpets and wall paper could do with an uplift but these are minor niggles. Itâs a beautiful art deco hotel with many original features which have been maintained well. The rooms were clean and functional, they have an iron and most have a coffee machine. The beds were so SO comfortable and extremely;5
This is a great hotel. Located across the street from Lincoln Center - easy to see the ballet. Our room was hot the first 2 nights, but, after asking 2 times to check it, they fixed AC. Even though we stayed in December, needed cool air.;5
My go to hotel in Hollywood. I always come in for the service and staff like Pil and Nelson never disappoint. The rooms are super clean and spacious for a single traveler. Must stay if you are in the area.;5
We stayed in the hotel for three nights. The room was brand new, very clean, bed was so comfortable, staff was friendly and food at breakfast were plentiful. Great location. We will definitely stay in here again when we visit London in the future.;5
Unfortunately we only got to stay in this hotel for 3 nights. Such a lovely hotel. We got into the que to check in and staff went to open new desks immediately to prevent the que from building. The lovely woman who checked us in gave us a room on the 32nd floor. Said that those rooms had been recently renovated.   Lobby was grand and pleasant doormen. Easy to find room and the view was amazing. It may not seem to everyone but it was my first time in America and New York has always been a huge dream to being able to see all the buildings from our 3 windows was amazing. Bed was super comfy and bathroom was small but clean and tidy. Show head could have been stronger but that wouldn't have ever ruined our stay.  The hotel seemed in perfect location, we walked to times sq every;5
Empire hotel is a wonderful hotel to stay for romantic getaway.  From the moment Luis checked us in our stay was fantastic.  Luis was absolutely the best.  He was very personable, courteous and professional.  When he learned the reason for our visit, romantic and my girlfriends 1st time in NYC, he went out of his way to make us feel special & did he ever!!  VIP is an understatement.  The room, views of Lincoln Center/City, rooftop bar options, and location absolutely rocked!!  We are already planning our next visit back and Empire/Luis will again be where we will start.  Thank you again for making it so memorable.;5
The Wyndham is an old style hotel in a perfect location.  It was very convenient to Penn Station, Macys, and all the attractions of Times Square and the Theatre District.  When I arrived I was quickly accommodated and informed I had been given a free upgrade to a suite!  The room was amazing and had a fantastic view of New York.  The elevators were fast and the staff very accommodating.  Overall it was a great stay.;5
Firstly we arrived at JFK and decided to get a yellow cab to the hotel. This cost around $78. It took over an hour. In hindsight we may have travelled to La Guardia as its closer. We were lucky when we arrived at the hotel. There was no queue to check in. I did see long check in queues on other days. We paid extra for upgraded rooms. We also got lucky with our room. It was a disability accessible room. We had ample space and the bathroom was big. The beds are awful...too soft for our taste. The rooms were cleaned to a good standard daily. Location excellent....in the middle of everything. Nothing was too far away. Because of the location it is very noisy at night. This never bothered us...we were tired from all the sight seeing during the day and had no trouble falling asleep.;5
Wonderful one week stay. Many thanks to Jolson for his help and great service throughout my stay. Lovely spacious room on the 31st Floor, views of the city, spotless. Housekeeping and all staff very helpful and friendly. Hotel location perfect for walking, catching the subway train and the bus on 7th or 8th St depending on whether going uptown or downtown. I was a returning customer after visiting previously 20 years ago. Hope to do it all again in the near future.;5
Me and my brother stayed here for our 21st birthday to New York, the hotel was amazing and they even upgraded our room free or charge and gave us complimentary WiFi and welcomed to balloons and sweets;5
Came to LA strictly for Movie stuff. Went to Universal Studios, Bel Aire Beverly Hills, Warner brothers etc. The VIP tour at Universal is very expensive but well worth the price, We would not have seen 1/4 of the park if it wasn't for our guide. Dont hesitate to save up and buy this package. Food is very expensive everywhere so be prepared. Uber is by far the best way to get around and cheapest.;5
Absolutely adored the Riad. The friendly staff made us feel very welcome, like part of the family. The breakfast every morning was amazing. Freshly cooked food and very generous portions. The phone that they provide is a god send. Someone will come and bring you back to the Riad if you manage to get lost in the Medina. They helped me to organise a trip to Essaouira. Very much looking to a return trip next year. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Marrakech!!;5
We thoroughly enjoyed our 6 night stay at the Riad Kheirredine, the staff where friendly, accommodating and helped us to organise and stick to our itinerary.   They arranged airport transfers, turned down our room around us, provided us with a mobile just in case we needed a guide to help us to find our way around, offered suggestions on places to eat. I will miss the complimentary mint tea when we come back from a day of exploring the Medina.  I don't tend to leave TripAdvisor reviews but after staying at this Riad I had to give them the 5 star rating that they deserve. I highly recommend this Riad if you are planning on visiting Marrakech.;5
We went on a 30th anniversart trip to NY with our 2 sons. Very friendly staff, rooms very clean. Our sons room was quite small but on our last night we were upgraded, free of charge, to a corner suite on the 40th floor with the most amazing views in all directions. Thank you Carlos!! Very convenient for all sights. Will definitely go back;5
Rough start on our first day, but itâs the quality of care sometimes. Definitely a hit or miss. We came in late and Pil was more than happy to help us in every way. Sometimes it just takes a good smile and care that is missing in a lot of places. Definitely recommend.;5
Fantastic location - Lincoln Centre to one side, Central Park to the other. Beautiful lobby/bar area. Good music  too. Chowder Restaurant- Excellent  Rooms are well appointed and have nice decor. We were fortunate to have a room overlooking both Central Park and the fountains at the Lincoln Centre.  We had a wonderful 4 night stay at the Empire and would highly recommend this hotel.;5
Very nice, impeccably clean, and absolute best location. Great attention at the front desk check in and check out. Jeff at the door was great, very helpful everyday.  Made for a very pleasant stay in NYC. Unbeatable price for the services and quality provided!;5
We decided to stay here while in Marrakech on our first year anniversary trip. I cannot say enough good things about this Riad.   Breakfast: wonderful selection of pastries, yogurt, meats, juice, coffee etc. the best breakfast we had while in Morocco, and better yet, included complementary.   Atmosphere: The decor of the hotel is very well done. Very traditional feeling, yet upscale. We stayed in one of the roof top rooms and loved that we could walk right out of our room to the pool or patio area. Our room was very comfortable. Greenery around the hotel makes it feel like an oasis in the middle of the hectic medina.  The plunge pool was very calming as well.   Staff:  Hands down the best part of the accommodation. As English speakers that do not know either Arabic or French,;5
First time visiting NYC and this hotel is in a great location. We had an upgraded room as I had a special birthday so we had a great view from the 23rd floor. Room was adequate and for a short stay when you donât spend a lot of time in a room. All the staff were friendly. Best feature is the location. Try The Houdnstooth pub along the road and Andrews Coffee Shop for breakfast.;5
This is the second time I stayed here, I truly recommend this hotel, the price ia very good compare with other hotels in the same area, also the hotel is very good located, is just across the street from the subway station, line red 1,2,3 this line is the same for broadway,times square and grand central, also is open 24 hrs , and this is just than excellent because if you are at times square in the middle of the night you can return to you hotel without any problem, also is just like 10 minutes walking to central park. I really recommend this hotel the room is clean and tge staff is nice;5
The Ameritania was warm and welcoming when we arrived. It was clean and helpful while we stayed there. It is walking distance to an amazing amount of tourist attractions. Next time we return we will be back here.  All the staff were great but the doorman, Jeff, was fantastic! His knowledge and gentleman's demeanour made a great trip into a fantastic trip! Thanks Jeff!;5
We were thrilled with Hyatt, unlike how we felt about American Airlines during a 15 hr layover immediately before and after a 14 hr international flight.  Hyatt LAX accommodated our request for early check in both ways, so we could get some life saving rest,  even though we were using points not cash, and were were treated like royalty!!   Courtesy Shuttle from LAX was clearly marked, very easy to find and use both ways running every 10 - 15 minutes.  I would highly recommend Hyatt LAX;5
We were lucky enough to spend 4 nights, with friends, in this superb Riad to celebrate my Husband's Birthday. Every attention to detail was met and the staff were all so helpful, friendly and professional.  Everything appeared as if by magic and the room was beautiful and always spotlessly clean.  We were treated to a typical Moroccan meal on our arrival, which was first class, as were the breakfasts every morning!  You could choose your venue for both food and drinks and it was magical to sit on the roof top terrace with a drink in your hand and watch the sun setting.  It was so different to stay somewhere that was right inside the medina but that was what made it the special place that it is.  They have thought of everything to give you peace of mind during your stay including;5
The New Yorker was everything I expected it to be. For the price you get decent rooms and good service.  It looks like used to be very fancy but hasnât been updated in a while. From the 23rd floor we could see a lot of Manhattan including the Empire State Building.;5
Room was comfortable, lovely and clean. Had everything you need for a  few nights away. Staff were friendly and helpful. Had a great time! Great location, close to restaurants theatres and bars. Will definitely stay here again.;5
We love the pool, restaurant, and how close this hotel is to the airport. Plus we have friends in Santa Monica and it's only a short Uber ride to get over there. The hotel is in great condition and the price is excellent too. Have stayed here twice and will continue to when we travel through LAX in the future.;5
Nice hotel, great rooms.  Pool however water was not that warm.  Very clean and staff was extremely kind.  Prices were very good.  Breakfast was AMAZING and a huge choice available.  Location is just OK.....;5
This iconic art-deco style 60's hotel is located in central Manhattan next to Pen station and is ideally placed for exploring by foot and by transport.  We were upgraded to a larger landscape view room on the 27th floor.  We were only staying for 3 nights so we were not to fussed but it was a novelty treat to look out across the NY skyline during the brief awake time spent in the room. There is a safe in the room, no charge.  The room was clean and tidy and room service was efficient.  The bathroom fittings were old but all functioned satisfactorily and served their purpose well.  The entrance hall of the hotel reflects the 60's heyday of that era.  The lifts could be busy at peak times but no unbearable delays.  Refreshments on site are provided by the Tick Tock Diner, which we;5
The hotel was perfectly placed, well within walking distance of Times Sq etc, but not in amongst all the noise. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the rooms excellent, beds comfortable, and good sized en suite, the staff were also extremely friendly and helpful.;5
This property is amazing and check-in was great as well.  My only issue is that I didn't automatically receive my Diamond Member benefits.  I had to mention it at check-in.  Other than that my stay was great.;5
Over the past five years I have stayed at the Empire. From the jewel box lobby with plush seating, to the cozy bar, to the spacious rooms, and the luxury products in the bathroom, this hotel is my go-to place. The staff is incredible, helpful, empathetic and always friendly. One standout is Jerry Lobruttu, who is handy with directions, restaurant recommendations or just a quick pep talk when trying to brave the New York weather. Good gym overlooking Columbus Circle.;5
We spent 6days in NYC during the heatwave.The New Yorker is a perfect place to return to from the crowded(yet exciting)streets, wonderful lobby area with very good a/c We ate at The Tick Tock every day,pleasant staff and quick service. Check in was great ,no line and no extra charges,even a local call I made from our room Was free.Security is good with smart polite men close to the elevators. We used the NY yellow water taxis to get about,there is a pier on 34th street and you can spend all day hopping on and off for 30 dollars,this is a great way to tour the city. Walk Brooklyn Bridge from Brooklyn towards Manhatten the views are goodTake a river Cruise and see the whole of the area,Ground Zero is a must as is Central Park and The  Empire State.We went to Baseball Game via the;5
"I travel for pleasure and for work and I have stayed at a few hotels, B&Bs, boutique hotels and Villas in my journeys.  I have never come across such unparalleled service, unparalleled comfort and unparalleled hospitality in my life. This is above Ritz Carlton level of stay and service. There was a car wait for us at the airport. There was someone to walk our luggage to the Riad along with one of the Riad Staff members. The was part of experience at no extra cost. Everyone knew about you before you arrived, the entire staff including;Elena, Sarah, Lamia and Sarah were there to serve and to please. Remembering how i liked my eggs in the morning, to what wine i liked at night to any particular food allergies that I or my wife had. It was breath taking and warmly welcomed. This was";5
Atmospheric and welcoming - spent three nights at Riad Kheirredine and loved every minute of it. The riad is down a maze of alleys in the heart of the medina, but don't let that put you off at all - Valentina, Ismail and the team give guests a phone each so they can summon assistance at any time and be guided back to this beautiful property, which has a cute courtyard and a delightful roof terrace. Take your breakfast up there - it's an epic spot for consuming a feast of eggs, Moroccan bread and preserves, pastries and cake with lashings of strong coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. Our room - Ambre, a quirky mix of Italian and Moroccan styles - was extremely comfortable and we slept like the dead. In a good way. All in all, a great choice if you want to a real sense of;5
From check in to check out the stay here was fantastic.  Maria, at the front desk, checked us in and upgraded us to a bigger...free of charge with great views of Lincoln Center and the water fountain.  The location is very convenient to shops, restaurants and Central Park.  A $6 dollar cab ride takes you to Times Sq. Area very safe and away from too much craziness.  Roof Deck is great for pictures and the bar is amazing.  Great bartenders.  Pool is small but quaint! The view is very nice and the signature sign is a photographers dream.  The DÃ©cor of the hotel is exquisite! Staff is very friends and the vibe is very hip.  Did not see anyone really over 40.  Hipster hotel!!! Very recommended! xoxo;5
"When I first walked in it was super quiet & had a doorman opening & closing the door. I checked in very quickly and the customer service I received while checking in was efficient, room was a bit small but very modern & had a huge mirror in the bedroom which is a plus because as a female you always need a good mirror in the room. The rooms were very close to together that I can here anything outside like as if it was inside. The bed was extremely comfortable & loved how heavy the curtains were that they didn't let any light in, in the morning. When checking out, I first got out of the elevator and saw so many people & in my head the first thing I am thinking about is ""oh my gosh I'm not checking out any time soon"" but I walked up to the desk a female by the name of Tiffany asked";5
Everyone was very friendly to work with. They were nice to allow an early check in and held our bags for a late departure. The location was fantastic, located next to the opera and one block west of Central Park.  A citi bike stop is directly out the front doors. The rooms were nice and clean. The a/c and heat system was outdated but works fine.;5
We stayed there for 5 days. The only thing I'd be able to complain is the carpet floor. Other than that, great staff- they were really polite And helpful. They offer toiletries, including tooth brushes. There's a metro station a block away, sÃ³ even when we got back, we never felt unsafe (we were in 3 girls). It's in Chinatown, but really close to Little Italy. Will recomend to everyone going to NY! Good price for a great place.;5
This hotel is a big hotel but treats its many clients as if its a small establishment, very friendly. The location for us was great. If you are on a budget or need a coffee or a bite to eat a McDonalds is right opposite. Just round the corner from Penn Station, which was wonderful for connecting with metro or trains etc.;5
Very nice hotel! Location was great. Pretty quiet and safe neighborhood. The staff was very nice and helpful!! They clean the lobby every single morning, which includes the windows and everything. Staff on duty 24/7. One minute walk to the subway station. There is a convenience store right across the street. This was my first trip to NYC and I was very happy with this hotel. I will definitely be staying there again.;5
Mylka was so helpful got me a room and was helping me out! Getting me and my family a room so helpful and a nice lady!helped us get a good room for our family and got us all sortied out! Rooms loooked nice;5
This hotel was recently renovated. The staff and accommodations were top grade!!!  Perfect place to stay if you have early flight. My only suggestion is they need keys for elevator floors. There is a free shuttle bus every five minutes leaving for airport.;5
Been here twice now and both times I have enjoyed my stay. The hotel is welcoming and classic in decor, the staff are friendly and will help with anything you need.   The rooms are clean and tidy whilst being well equipped for a short or long stay. The maids come in everyday and make the beds as well as replacing towels if needed.   Location is ideal, subway next door as well as Times Square and Empire State Building within 10min walk.   Will certainly stay again should I visit NYC in the near future.;5
My husband and I stayed at this hotel both going to and coming from our vacation.  We will choose to stay here again for our next trip through LAX.  The shuttle from the airport was easy to find and the driver very helpful with the bags.  My daughter and her husband didnât have many bags, (and they are young and spry!) so they walked to the hotel easily.;5
We just completed our stay at Hilton Universal City.  It is a beautiful hotel with a great location.  It is within walking distance to the theme park (approx 12-14 minutes) and there is also a hotel shuttle service provided from the hotel to City Walk.   We highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit the Universal City area.;5
"This is a classic Icon of a hotel in the heart of the city.   We have been here many times and it seems to get better and better each time!  The staff is very professional.  The room is roomy for a NY hotel.   The beds are comfortable and the shower is amazing!!!  Lots of pressure!   The views are great and the history museum wall in the basement area is worth looking at...such fun in the ""old days!""   There is an excellent Italian Restaurant off of the lobby and coffee is served in the lobby in the morning with really good croissants!  Everything is walk able and near by...even in the winter months.   We seen the Rockettes at Radio City Hall...a lot of fun!!!  Don't miss Shen Yun at Lincoln Center...coming up!!   We will be back at the The New Yorker soon!!!";5
I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the room and the overall presentation of the hotel.  The hotel is a great value for my business trip and I did not have to sacrifice on a little style and comfort.   Excellent location.;5
10 lovely days in June! The entire staff at Kheireddine are genuine and cared for us in a heartfelt manner. The place is an oasis of peace and offers an enjoyable atmosphere in pleasant surroundings. Located a couple of hundred meters from the souks in the Medina, it proved perfect for us. Highly recommended!;5
Just returning from a global managerial offsite for a Fortune 500 tech company at the Empire Hotel. Couldn't have been more impressed! Gregory Cau and Jose Galeano orchestrated excellent service over many days. Several team members were lodging at the iconic hotel as well and thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of their experience.;5
Stayed here so we could view a Broadway show. It was a great experience. Front desk staff and bartender were awesome. Rooms and bathrooms are fully renovated but the halls show the age. Noticed a slight smoke smell in hall and our door fully shut fine but did not seal fully tight. Old bones in NYC are expected. Beds were very comfortable with great AC unlike other hotels we've stayed in. Hotel was great in appearance, close to shows, food, stores, and a pub/bar.  Wifi is $10 for 2 devices but lobby has it free. I would definitely stay here again.;5
Great location for my stay!  The staff at the hotel we're above & beyond helpful!   Rooms had a few nice touches, Keurig in room, Umbrella's in each room, it did rain so very helpful, The bellman suggested an awesome little Restaurant where locals go, great food & walking  Distance, very affordable! Many options for parking!  Great Stay!;5
My family and I went to California on vacation with plans to visit the Disney resorts and Universal Studios and the attractions nearby. Rather than staying on the Disney property for the entire visit, we decided to move to a more central location, and based on the high ratings on TripAdvisor, chose this hotel.  We arrived at 1:30, the hotel had an atmosphere of chaos as there were a ton of news vehicles parked outside and there was this buzz of preparation in the hotel. When we checked in, we were informed that our room wasn't ready( no biggie at all), but we could leave our luggage and when the room was ready, it would be sent up. We also verfied that we had upgraded our room to an executive floor which included a continental breakfast. They tagged our bags and sent us on our;5
Loved our stay at the Empire. Check In was so easy, room was always spotless. The door men are SO great at helping you with directions and getting a taxi. We felt very safe and the location canât be beat. I wish we had control of the thermostat but thatâs my only complaint.;5
This is not a five star hotel but the view from the park view windows is 7 star! My room on the 4th floor looks straight out on to Central Park and the same view in a five start would be triple the price.  The bed was very comfortable, the room was very clean and I could not fault anything, although it was only fairly small (as much room as I needed)  The staff were very friendly, by far the best service all trip from hotel staff, although I suspect they may have been the owners, which in itself was great.;5
Staff is very friendly and helpful!! We had Elias help us check in and he was very nice! Rooms are really cute and clean.... Only was able to stay one night but I would definitely stay here again to check out everything else they had to offer!;5
Amazing experience. Staffs are very friendly. Initially we thought the staff is rude, but later realized that very helpful and friendly. Thanks to Krystal. First time to NY. Subway station is only few steps away. They offered us a free upgrade to a suite which was amazing. Beautiful view and balcony outside. The 2 double bed room was little congested. Plenty of elevators. Overall very nice. Thanks New Yorker.;5
We stayed here whilst in Los Angeles as it was so much cheaper than Hollywood or Beverley Hills but a bit of a drive .Lovely hotel, super big rooms , valet parking, good breakfast and such helpful ,friendly staff. Definitely reccommend !;5
Let me start by saying I NEVER write reviews. Too much hassle. But this Riadâ¦ oh, this Riad deserves all the positive praising in the world.  Iâm an avid traveler, outside and inside my country (Portugal). Even though Portugal isnât at the top of the game when it comes to hotel services and experiences, Asia is. My boyfriendâs from Macau and we travel a lot throughout Asia. This Riad is the only place Iâve been in and next to Europe that deserves such praise.  The service is justâ¦ out of this world. What you can expect: - they will clean your room and change the towels, at least, twice a day. Or more. You donât even need to ask. - free water and sparkling water.  - free coffee and ice coffee.  - same for tea. - same for biscuits and fruit and dry fruits. - pool open all day long;5
I do not even consider staying elsewhere in NYC. Clean place and very efficient staff. I have been staying here for every trip to NYC and am very satisfied, prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this hotel.;5
Excellent service we were taken care of directly by the manager Pil and always very friendly, it made it easier for us to enter the room. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The hotel has ample beds, a full gym and a sauna. He even helped us with our walk.;5
"I was a guest of the Hilton, Universal City from June 23 to June 26, 2008.    It was a great experience starting with check in with Fidel at the Front Desk.......and my ""alcove"" room, which was amazing....(and complimentary fruit, cheese and cookie basket) as a surprise!  Housekeeping was exceptional, Vilma with room service was great.....William in the lounge area made a great Mojito, Carlos at the Starbucks counter was friendly and Danny at the Bell Station, helped me with my check out....THANK YOU STAFF OF HILTON!  I will definitely be back......it is an honor to be a Silver VIP with HiltonHonors.....";5
Very nice hotel, great location.  We stayed in one night and had drinks on the ground floor.  The drinks were excellent and so were Michael and Vanessa, the two very friendly staff members that helped us.  I highly recommend.;5
Absolutely very nice hotel to stay! Especially if you want to find a hotel close to LAX, this can be your best option. From LAX, you can even walk to the hotel in a few minutes, besides the hotel shuttle. You can watch from your room some busy activities of the airport!;5
Fantastic location just off Central Park. Beautifully decorated throughout, rooms very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff are very very friendly and helpful. The downstairs bar area is a lively buzzing area in the evenings. The upstairs terrace is a fantastic viewing area to take in the atmosphere from above. I can imagine the area to always be full on warm summer evenings as the sun left around 5pm during our stay. I wold recommend the Empire hotel to anyone planning a stay in the Big Apple.;5
Travelled from California and Stayed here for a week in June .The hotel is located in the Medina ( the old town) which is highly recommended if you really want the Moroccon experience.The Medina is hard to navigate but the hotel staff are great with directions and will walk you to drop off points. They even give you a cell phone to call them in case you get lost! I must qualify this review by mentioning that I am a hotel owner in CA and therefore pretty picky about what I look for when I travel. The hotel only has around 14 rooms and from what I counted around 11 separate communal areas including two pools terraces and library which makes for an intimate experience where you can escape with your partner or mingle with other guests. We met some lovely people there. The;5
When we arrived to the hotel we were greeted by Nancy and Dena at the reception desk. They were very friendly and kind and helped us out a ton when we made a mistake regarding the reservation.  They were patient and extremely understanding of our situation.;5
The riad was absolutely beautiful. The staff was also very friendly, warm and hospitable. We were quite a big group and the staff made our stay very easy and comfortable. They assisted us in any way they could. it was a great experience staying at this riad.;5
Great, fast check-in  aftera long day. It was a Friday night and Daniel at the front desk was terrific. Plus a great location.  Id look forward to recommending this hotel to anyone travelling to Los Angeles!;5
We stayed here between 11th and 18th  July the location on 54th st  is excellent for almost everything few minutes walk to times square in 1 direction a few minutes walk to central Park in the other direction right in the middle of the theatre district and the reasturant district 2 minutes walk from 59th st subway  Apart from the excellent location our  room was excellent we stayed in room 415 the room was serviced every day and a mini bar was always avalable there was complimentery tea coffee and ice cold water avalable at reception we never used the bar or reasturant  The reception staff were always  very helpful and welcoming and I must make a special mention to to the bellman Jeff who gave us a map and pointed out where we were and the best way to get to places of interest;5
Great stay, convenient, fast pick up for transfer to hotel, quick room service, clean, efficient.  Staff friendly and efficient as well.  Food quality was exceptional and the connection with the bar area provided comfortable experience.;5
We have recently returned from a 3 day break to Marrakech to celebrate my wife's 50th Birthday and we were not disappointed to have booked and stayed at the beautiful Riad Kheirredine .  We stayed in Lotus room which was lovely , the breakfasts each morning could be taken on the roof terrace and were fantastic . The Riad is owned by an italian family and its run very professionally with very welcoming and warm staff . The Riad itself is at first a little in the middle of the Medina and you think you will never find your way back but this is easily overcome by the staff who give you a mobile phone and will come and guide you back should you need any help . The Riad itself is beautifully furnished , very clean and I would definately recommend this to anyone wishing to stay close;5
We have just had an amazing stay at Premier Inn County Hall. Excellent location, affordable price and THE BEST staff we have ever had the pleasure to meet. We felt more than valued, it was like staying with friends. All staff really cared, were interested and passionate about giving the best experience possible. We were sad to leave and will be back. A benchmark for all other staff in other hotels to aspire to. Thank you so much!;5
We had an amazing view from the 16th floor corner room we stayed in however I was very disappointed that our room was still not ready at 4.30 in the afternoon even though this was the second time we had tried to check in during the day. Despite this we had a wonderful time at the Hilton and would love to visit again.;5
This is my first stay at the Empire, although I have eaten at the fabulous Ed's Chowder House several times before performances at Lincoln Center.  The location is perfect.  We walked in Central Park, shopped at Columbus Circle, and the Met was a quick stroll across the street.  The room was very minimalist but comfortable.  The staff really makes this hotel special.  Thanks to Romeo and everyone else who helped make our stay so pleasant.  The Empire will be my New York home away from home from now on.;5
Thanks Victor for your great service at the bar! You helped me with something and I wasnât sitting at the bar and I appreciate you!  This is the reason we stay here- service and location! Service is Key!;5
Nearly forgot to write this review but couldn't not share this gem! The situation is perfect, the rooms very comfortable and clean and the staff were extremely helpful. A big shout out to JEFF and JULIAN, polite and full of useful advice. We came as a family of 4 and would certainly love to come back. I have recommended this hotel to many. We look forward to seeing you again ðºð¸;5
We wanted to say that the Hollywood Hotel is a great place to stay at if you wanted to stay in central Los Angeles where everything is. We are grateful to Nicole that was very friendly and kind during our stay. She helped us out in everything we need and made us feel welcomed. Thank you Nicole.;5
We got to the hotel and checking in was pretty fast and smooth. Muhammad was nice and professional. The staff seem to have fun working together. One thing that bothered me was their mandatory facility fee. We got charged about $32 a night for amenities that we never used. The hotel seems well kept a few things need to be updated but I love how they kept most of the building as is. Just wished they polished or cleaned some bathroom tiles more, the corners of the bathroom where pretty filthy when we got there but if your just there to shower, sleep and go sightseeing it really isn't that big of a deal. Staff is great and courteous, housekeeping did call us to see if we needed anything since we had the do not disturb sign up the whole time.  The view from our room was amazing and;5
The breakfast staff were perfect, there was a man outside that was faultless. Would come again just for those men, they were friendly and helpful. Always smiling and a pleasure to see each day. Very good at there jobs;5
Good location near public transport, only 15 mins into times square on the train. Lots of cool affordable restaurants around morningside and amazing begel shop on the corner prefect for breakfast quick stop!!;5
this was our first trip to Morocco, we chose Marrakech as we wanted to see the sights in the old city. On our arrival we were met by staff from the Riad, they took us to the hotel which was a minute walk. Inside the hotel Elena immediately made us comfortable by offering tea and cakes. We were given a smartphone which had a GPS so that they could locate us to arrange a taxi pickup or send one of there staff to find us and walk us back. The Riad was beautifully furnished with numerous resting areas, we particularly liked the rooftop which at night was pleasant place to have dinner, the food was very good, better than most restaurants we visited. I would highly recommend this Riad and would not hesitate going back.;5
The hotel was absolutely amazing between gorgeous views and an unbelievable rooftop area. The staff was very attentive and super helpful. Nicole Agnello made my stay feel like I was home, the entire trip.;5
Stayed here for 6 nights mid March. On arrival there was a  small queue to check in but the lovely lady I think her name was Krystal sat at the Customer service desk called us over and checked us in. We had booked a queen view room, we were told that the room wouldn't be ready for about an hour but we could leave our cases in the storage area and go back in an hour. on our return the room was ready and we had been given vouchers for a complementary drink and breakfast as a thanks for waiting. Our room was on the 23rd floor with a view out over Maddison sq Garden, the room was a good size and was very clean and we loved the Art Deco features. our room was serviced every day and the towels changed on request everything worked well the shower was hot and powerful and for a change;5
I have stayed at this hotel for 5 times now, every visit has been great. I would recommend you to ask staff for advise to help make the trip as good as possible, I have contacted staff a number if times and they have been great. They organised travel for me to events in New York and New Jersey.  Excellent location, near station, Times Square (4 minutes walk) and most central manhattan attractions. Underground stops beside hotel. Easy access from Newark airport.  Good price for a hotel so close to everything, 5 star.;5
Extraordinary mattress and bedding created a marvelous recipe for a great night's sleep at the Empire Hotel.  The sheets felt like Egyptian cotton and plenty of perfect pillows provided great comfort.  The rooms were very clean, and newly redecorated.  Great location across from Lincoln Center.  Gracious staff, terrific lobby bar.  When can I come back??;5
I love staying here.  This property is so close to Penn Station, no cab necessary!  Also, if you're going to a show at Madison Square Garden, it's right there.  I consider it 'home base' while in New York City (Manhattan at least);5
I was in London with a friend. I booked this place before I left the states. It is conveniently located near the tube and many places to eat. The bed was comfortable and room was clean. Had a nice ensuite bathroom. The amour was a little cheap and needed some help but it served its purpose for the few days we were there. Mugs were provided in the room as well. I would definitely stay at this place again.;5
Convenient to Lincoln Center, good restaurants & subway. Worth the price to us to be able to walk to Lincoln Center.  All rooms are noisy (it is New York, after all).  Rooms on the inside are quieter than on the outside.;5
Stayed for 10 days in February and we had an amazing time! The hotel was perfect, rooms were great, spacious and always super clean. The staff at the reception were very helpful. The breakfast every morning was great, the head chief who made our eggs every morning was so lovely and friendly! Perfect location for sightseeing around LA, very easy to access the metro from just across the road! 100% would recommend to a friend.;5
This hotel is in an excellent location, but the best thing about it is the staff, they could not do enough for you.   Jeff, was so helpful and always smiling...look out for him!  The only downside was the breakfast, paper plates and plastic knives and forks...not good!  Go somewhere else for breakfast!;5
Great Hotel in a great location just behind the London Eye, super close to the Thames and a pleasant short walk to The Southbank, Hayward Gallery and Tate Modern. Was perfectly located for our trip to The Old Vic, which was just a ten minute walk away. Very reasonably priced parking nearby, made this location very convenient.;5
Very friendly staff, clean rooms and a perfect location. The hotel did exactly what it said on the tin, and I wouldn't hesitate to book a room here for my next trip to NYC - which I hope is very soon.;5
Outstanding:  1) Room super clean,  2) Lounge all fresh fruits, clean,  3) Exercise facility is very quiet and full function,  4) Lobby very nice, lot of room and warm welcome,  valet parking very active, quick service alway have car park right at front door after receive requested from room;5
Beautiful room with stunning views from windows spanning the length of the room.  Excellent close vacinity to Universal Studios, fantastic to save money on the travel costs getting there. City Walk two minutes away next to Universal with an array of restaurants and shops. The most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in, was like sleeping on clouds. No refridgerator or microwave etc, has a mini bar if you can afford it, lovely experience. Only draw back is the dismal elevators, I'm convinced my hair grew 3mm each time we endevoured the long long wait for the elevator, it may have been quicker, if I was superfit to run up to the 38th floor have a ten minute rest and await my husbands arrival in the elevator..... I jest and exagerate on the length of time but it felt very timely and;5
Wow ! What a fabulous Riad , I totally understand & agree with all the previous reviews regarding the Riad & all itâs staff ,  Every client is treated with the utmost respect & care , We started our days having a sumptuous breakfast on the top terrace in the sunshine , then went out on sight seeing trips organised by the girls in the office , all highly recommended , once we got our bearings we did venture out to the Medina on our own , fully assured that if we ever got lost the Riad would send one of the boys to find us ! All helped by the mobile phone they issue you with for just such events . The rooms are superb & the beds are super comfy , thereâs no need to take toiletries with you as they supply the very best quality money can buy . The restaurant food is exceptional , we;5
I love this hotel. This was my second stay in 3 months. I came back again because the first time was so pleasant. Clean and comfortable. Excellent location. Several restaurants within a couple blocks.;5
We arrived in NYC via Amtrak/ Penn Station.  The hotel was a short walk from the station.  Since the room was not ready when we arrived we were able to check our bags for a small fee.  We were right down the street from the Empire State Building and within a 20 minute walk to all the mid-Manhattan sites (Rockefeller center, Theatre district, Time Square).  We were assigned a room on the 32nd floor with a breathtaking view of the city and the Empire State Building.  The room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom vintage but clean.  The hotel staff were friendly and personable.  Plenty of outlets for cell phone charging and good Wi-Fi connection.  My daughter had a memorable 17th birthday.;5
We stayed here for four nights and were impressed with the cleanliness, friendliness and efficiency of the hotel staff.   Beautiful rooms, fabulous views from anywhere in the hotel. My only complaint is the wifi and the shuttle (it's a joke) and the high parking fees.  The beds are cozy, rooms are aptly furnished, coffee makers are wonderful, hot tub is relaxing and it's close to everything!;5
Clean and Center of Manhattan. Very near subway station, Central park and many restaurant. very convenient, very recommended and price is little bit high :) but... Indeed, nothing cheap in New York :);5
"I just got back from a 3 night stay at the Empire Hotel, with my husband and 2 friends. We absolutely loved this hotel. I'll admit that I only wanted to stay there because Chuck Bass ""owns"" it xoxo. However we were delightfully surprised at how great it was. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We arrived a few hours before check in, but they had a room ready for us. The room and bathroom were small, but it's New York. I liked that the window opened to get some fresh air in. We went to the rooftop bar at least once a day. The staff was very friendly and professional. The location is great! Next to a Starbucks, 2 blocks from the park, Century 21 & Lincoln Center across the street, one block from subway station. The doorman always asked if we need directions or a cab.";5
We were one staying 2 nights and the hotel was great for that length of stay. But, it would have been fine to stay longer! The staff was really nice, the hotel bar was quaint, the location is in Times Square but not right in the middle which I prefer. A lot of people complained about the WiFi but that didn't affect us, really. I would definitely stay again.;5
I have travelled all around the world and can honestly say the service we received was beyond anything I have previously experienced before. To get to the Riad you do have to walk through some dusty back small roads but please do not be phased or put off by this the hotel staff are more than happy to walk you to the main road ( we ended up walking alone after the 1st day) they even give you a  Mobile phone to call them on if you need collecting from the main road or a taxi. Everything was outstanding the service, the food , the rooms and most importantly the staff. Every member of staff bent over backwards to help you and showed a genuine interest in how your day was and where you spent the day. I will most defiantly be back .;5
Awesome place, clean centered to everything,  Pil was super helpful and nice , he answered all my questions and even suggested me places to visit here in Hollywood, would definitely stay here again in my next vacation, secure parking on site was a plus;5
We were there for one night and were very pleased with the hotel and the hotel staff,f all of whom were professional, friendly, and very helpful. The was one staff member who shone the brightest - Dwayne who was our bell-hop. He went above and beyond in his helpfulness and attention to detail. He wanted to be sure everything went well. and we had everything in our room we needed.  He is warm, friendly, eager to please and I'm sure he will go far in the hospitality business with his great attitude and business ethic.;5
Stayed in October to celebrate my best friend birthday. Hotel is close to everything. Only 2 minutes walk from the Santa Monica train station. Hotel is very well maintained. Breakfast was delicious.  Staff were excellent.  Specially Nancy who gave us a free upgrade to a newly remodeled room when we told her the reason of our stay.  Thank you all. I will be back in a couple of months but this time with my family. See you soon Hollywood Hotel!;5
We stayed one night before a long trip.  The shuttle to and from the airport came every 10 minutes and delivered us to the hotel quickly with no problems.  The rooms were very clean and roomy.  They included many outlets, including USB plugins.  The restaurant had a limited menu for dinner and breakfast, but was ok.  The staff was very pleasant and checkin was easy.  We took a day trip and they helped us find one which picked us up at the hotel.  I highly recommend it if you want a convenient room by the airport.;5
My wife daughter and I have just returned from a week in Marrakech, a city we love and which we have visited on numerous occasions. For this holiday we chose to stay at Riad Kheirredine, mainly due to the excellent reviews we had read on Tripadvisor. Walking through the front door of the Riad we were also captivated by the beauty of the hotel, the attention to detail in the decoration in each corner inspired by moroccan culture and the warmth of the welcome of the staff who were eager to make us feel at home. The rooms are located around three beautiful patios with passages and winding steps leading up to a spacious roof terrace which is delightfully furnished. There are numerous comfortable futons creating comfortable zones to chat, rest or take in the sky line of the city.;5
Great rooming at the hotel. Much free things sauna pool breakfast WiFi. Everything needed for vacation and work at the same time. I travel around the world and this hotel has some of the friendliest staff. Especially Pil who goes more than his duties to make guest happy. Happy stay and will return many times.;5
I went to Los Angeles for a couple of art opening's and found this Hotel that was kinda perfect. Close to good hiking in Griffith Park and not far to Galleries in Hollywood area. Its a bit unassuming from the outside but had everything we needed.   The rooms were great, not giant but very comfortable and clean with a small fridge and sitting porch that overlooked the courtyard.  The pool area was a little oasis from the crazy LA traffic outside, Plenty of shade and good furniture. The breakfast was fresh with friendly cooks ready to make omelet's of your own design.   Everyone we met who worked there were totally professional, and the overnight desk dude was great , can't remember his name, sorry dude.   Gisel Miller also at the front desk was excellent and very helpful with;5
"The room was big enough for a couple, even for three or four people; two queen beds and a renovated bathroom. I totally recommend this hotel. It is hard to find a decent hotel for less than $100/night in Manhattan. The price was very good and you get a 15% discount on Manhattan Dinner showing your room cards. I will come back to this hotel on my next NY weekend trip.";5
Every year I go to Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) at Universal Studios Hollywood. For the first few years, I would get a hotel room near the Hollywood Bowl area, which is nearby but still requires transportation via the subway or Uber / Lyft to get to and from the park. The Hilton Universal is LITERALLY an 8-minute walk from the main entrance to the park and/or the Universal City-walk (I timed it). I'll cut to the end and say that after walking for 8 hours (and nearly 8 miles) around Universal Studios, knowing that I only had to walk less than 10 minutes at 1am to get back to my room was VERY WELCOMING, and much preferred to the walk all the way down the hill to the subway, or to catch a rideshare.   The room is exactly what you should expect from a Hilton Hotel. My room looked;5
We love the Universal City Hilton!  We returned after having such a great stay a year ago.  We had a rental car  and everything that we wanted to see and do was within a short driving distance.  The hotel feels safe and the staff is extremely courteous, welcoming and makes you feel like a valued guest.  It is easily walkable to Universal Studios and City Walk or you can just enjoy the exciting view out of your window! We will be back :);5
This hotel out of all of the hotels I have visited is by far the very best. The service is absolutely outstanding. If you have not visited Marrakesh previously then you must  stay at the Riad, from the airport pick up, to the guide to meet you, to the map and phone provided (with a 24 hour service if you get lost), to the hotel and rooms itself, to the most outstanding welcome, to the friendly so helpful staff, to the food to the everything. This really really is the most amazing place to stay and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone visiting Marrakesh - 10 out of 10 from us.;5
Just back from my first trip to Marrakech, so glad we chose Riad Kheirredine. Without a doubt the best service I have ever received in a hotel. Nothing is too much from for the staff, booking taxi's, amending restaurant reservations, meeting you to guide you back to the Riad etc. The rooms were outstanding, every single member of staff is fantastic, the spa brilliant, I could go on, but you get the picture. We even had a surprise birthday cake prepared for us for my partners birthday which had happened a few days prior to our visit.  If you are thinking about booking the Riad, do it, you won't be disappointed.;5
Cool Ambiente, clean room, nice reception. BUT no parking available. You must find a spot on the street, which in NYC is usually very scarce. Thus not recommended for travellers with a car. I got lucky after circling the block a few times. On the positive side, if you like to party on weekends the ballroom downstairs is loads of fun.;5
When me and my family first arrive at the hotel we are welcomed by the staff who was very nice and happy. We lived on the 4th floor in a very nice room with a very modern and fresh bathroom and comfy beds. Some people have complained about the noise but i slept with the window opened and that did not bother me at all. The hotel is very ewll located, with just a 3 minute walk to central park and the nearest subway station. Freee internetwas provided with an decent speed. Really great hotel over all, maybe a little better wifi connection in the lobby would be nice;5
An excellent hotel especially for visiting universal studios. Great interior to hotel, very nice rooms with very interesting views of LA including lots of mansions on the hills. Attentive staff and excellent breakfast. Nice pool. Takes two minutes to walk to universal and city walk. There's lots of resturants to choose from at city walk. Can't think what its called but we ate at an American steak house type resturant (closest to the hotel when walking to the studios) it was very nice (and cheap of course). Oh and the SImpsons ride was really fantastic at universal!;5
We always enjoy staying here!  We stayed for Thanksgiving break and had a park view room on the 19th floor that was amazing!!   We love the convenience of taking the shuttle to Universal (arrives every 15 min) or walking (a 5-10 min walk).  Employees are always friendly and helpful and our room was great!  We ordered room service for dinner that was very good!  Would highly recommend if youâre visiting a Universal Studios and Citywalk!;5
What a pleasure to arrive at a large hotel and find it easy  to navigate from the lower parking lot then find the elevators locate the front desk then the rooms without any issues at all.The entire property is set up really great.If your stay includes a visit to universal studios then the Hilton is a must ,especially if you have a large group or multiple children.Just a short walk over the foot bridge will get you to all the action.The rooms are top quality the staff was wonderful.We did not get a chance to experience any of the buffets,but the food looked excellent.I would stay again without any hesitation.;5
You can't get closer to Universal Studios than the Hilton and with CityWalk accessible without a Universal Studios ticket, you're catered for perfectly for your whole stay. Super helpful staff, somewhere to fill up your water bottles every day and check out the enormous fish in the very relaxing garden! Suggestions: a wider tea selection (seems to be a USA thing), move the smoking area so everyone leaving the hotel on foot won't have to walk through the smoke and our shower dripped all night and had variable heat (last time was perfect but first two times was barely room temperature - needs to have an instant hot water system so not impacted by other users).;5
Where do I start?!?! Myself and my wife stayed here recently for a four night stay and we have absolutely no complaints about this hotel. Right from the moment we walked through the doors to the moment we left the hotel to go home, everything was just spot on. We met Mohammed at check in and he kindly gave us a beautiful room on the 35th floor with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building and a complimentary bottle of wine as our trip was to celebrate my wifes 40th birthday. Our room was lovely with such a comfy bed and all the usual extras like hairdryer, bath/shower products and a fine size tv. There is a lovely atmosphere in the hotel and staff are all friendly. There is also such a safe feeling about it too as you have to show your room key to security to get to the;5
This is a beautiful Hilton with Vegas like amenities. A couple really nice, upscale dining options and some shopping inside the hotel. Anthony (from studio city) checked us in and was so kind, and professional. It was a really nice start to the trip and honestly the only reason Iâm leaving this review. I was more than impressed by everything from the room to the view to the staff. Fantastic value.;5
Spent 4 nights here after a week in Vegas. This was our second visit here third in NYC. Emailed prior to arrival to say it was a special occasion and got a new room on 7th floor. View not too good but cracking new room well equipped and great maid service.  Check in smooth and the hotel is well placed for all attractions. Was there for my birthday on st Patrick's day and had birthday cards held there for me sent from uk no problems. In summary in my opinion one of the best placed best value hotels in NYC;5
We were here for a night. The hotel is in a nice location, rooms are very nice and they all have nice views. I've lived in LA in the past, it is close to Sunset, Hollywood blvd and universal city.  The lounge in the lobby is nice I highly recommend this hotel.;5
My wife an I recently visited NYC for a pre-holiday get-away!  The Wyndham New Yorker is strategically located near Times Square and the Theater District.  The entire staff of the Wyndham New Yorker cheerfully worked to make sure our stay was safe and enjoyable!  This a a GREAT place to stay near many of the Big Apple's attractions!;5
Everyone was so helpful from the start. We came here on a mini honeymoon and when they found out Jerry from the front desk sent up some proseco which was a wonderful touch! The rooms were very clean and we had a great view. Overall it was the perfect place to stay!;5
Just across the street from the Universal Studio Park. Super comfortable beds, crisp fluffy linens, fantastic views (20th floor). The continental breakfasts are excellent, but the buffet is even better! Every staff member has been so helpful, smiling, and simply awesome to us. I'm so happy with our choice to stay with this particular Hilton. Oh and the room service is so good. First time I've ever ordered a room service burger and it was actually prepared the way I had requested it. I'll be referring this Hilton to every family I know that is coming to universal studios or HOLLYWOOD.;5
"There is no better place to stay in NYC!  We wanted a view and  Art Deco and did they deliver! From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed by Hector who kindly took care of our car and valises and Miguel who checked us in and gave excellent service from A to Z. I even passed by a couple days into our stay and Miguel  remembered me by name and ensured everything was excellent which it was. Now THAT is personalized service and impressive when the hotel's hundreds of room are full! Our room was glorious and provided a million dollar view ""Right through the very heart of it, New York, New York "", the worlds greatest metropolis. All amenities in room were perfect - comfy beds, great furnishings, lovely toiletries. The cleaning staff were very accommodating and did a fantastic";5
The Jane has a couple of large rooms, for those who require such. I am a 68 year old senior citizen and I recommend the small cabins to all who might want to try one but have a little trepidation. Shared bath? Yes, and it is clean and comfortable. The showers are wonderful. Tiny room? Yes, but it is quiet and clean and I always sleep very well. The T.V is there, for those who watch television, with numerous channels. I have stayed at The Jane more than once, and will continue to do so. I travel quite a bit and I love this hotel. The restaurant is great, the staff is great, the location is great. Take a walk up to The Corner Bistro and let Harold serve you a terrific burger. Elephant & Castle is close by on Greenwich, their breakfast is highly recommended. This is the place to;5
We spent a wonderful week at Riad Kheirredine in May. The property is superb in every way, with the rooftop being the star of the show.   The staff are as good as you will ever get - anywhere in the world. The ladies in reception act like you own personal secretary and genuinely want to help in any way they can. The waiting staff are always there for you and welcome you each day like a old friend. And the kitchen team produce great food.   We were made to feel incredibly special in this beautiful location.  The owners have done a wonderful  job in setting the bar so high - congratulations!  We loved our stay so much that, prior to checking out, we booked to return in September.  Top class!;5
Each of my stays at the Hyatt Regency LAX has been very comfortable. The facilities and the rooms are clean, attractive, and easy to navigate. Every member of their personnel  has been helpful, courteous, and professional. I will continue to choose the Hyatt Regency whenever I am in Los Angeles.;5
I stayed here last week for 4 nights with my partner and from start to finish we had the most fabulous time at the Riad Kheirredine. The hotel is right in the centre which can be a bit daunting as you have to very quickly learn the route too and from the hotel via the narrow alleys however after a few escorted journeys we got the hang of avoiding the motorbikes and walking on the right! Our room was right next to the little pool on the rooftop and honestly it felt like we were the only guests most of the time as we seemed to always get the prime sunbeds right next to the water. The food is fantastic.. be prepared to eat alot of bread and lamb tagine and drink the most sugary tea you have ever consumed in your life. All the staff are incredibly friendly and will do all they can;5
Upon arrival we were greeted professionally by the door staff who got our bags for us, although the hotel didnt have available the room we'd booked, because of this, they offered us complimentary breakfast everyday and free Wifi. The room was tidied every day and the bed was very comfy. Also big thanks to Jeff the door man, who was very helpful when we were checking out!;5
Stayed at The Jane last week by myself, all my fears about being a single female traveler were unfounded! The rooms are very secure and the hotel itself is in a nice neighbourhood, I felt totally safe walking around after dark. Yes the rooms are tiny but your in New York, how much time are you going to be in there! The bathrooms were very clean and well presented, I only had to wait in line on one morning and I think thatâs because the marathon was on and everyone wanted to be out early. My only recommendation would perhaps be a vending machine somewhere so you could grab snacks and drinks quickly.;5
"If you are looking for a hotel in a great spot, close to the metro and cheap; you found it!!! If you are looking for fancy, go spend three times as much some where else. Clean..ish and cheap. It gets loud in the morning, but hopefully you'll be up and out to explore the city by then. Check out the multitude of restaurants and bars in the area.";5
I'm a NYC resident and decided to do a staycation and had such a great experience here. Everyone was friendly, we had great views and a really fun time. We worked with someone on their team to set it up - Jose Galeano - and he was very quick and polite. Would highly recommend.;5
had to stay inn the area and Pil was awsome he got us in even though it was super late and he  was super nice. other places i went they turned me away but my dude Pil really did me a solid. thanks pil ill be back;5
We stayed for 5 days at this Riad and it truly exceeded our expectations. From the moment we stepped in to the Riad we were pampered. The Riad is beautiful with large banana trees in the court yard, a beautiful terrace with a lovely pool. But what makes this riad is the team they have there. I may forget some names, but Illyas, Yasine, Hassan, Hamza, ibrahim, the girls on the front desk were super amazing. They made us feel welcome and at home and I truly wouldnt stay anywhere else if i came back to marrakech. Additionally, the food is spectacular. The tagine the chef makes is out of this world. We seriously couldn't find anything that matched it outside at some very nice restaurants.  thanks for the beautiful stay and we  look forward to coming again!;5
The service was great. The shuttle ran every 10 or 15 minutes to Universal studios/City Walk. Clean/nice beds. Pool area clean/nice/warm pool. Like the Cabana and grass area. Servers at pool were great.;5
Highly recommended. Clean, chic, modern, professional atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was picture worthy. Room service is excellent. Bathroom was spotless and they had complimentary Figi water - superb.;5
"I attended a company function at this property after a night's rest.  It was very convenient because of the hotel location.  It is located near terminal 1 at LAX.  Thus, the title of this review.  The hotel is clean and the staff is wonderful.  From check-in to house cleaning, everyone is cordial and polite; I was impressed.  Parking structure is a shared building with Quick airport parking, otherwise airport shuttle is frequently run.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to those who need some rest between flights.";5
Amazing Riad!! Probably one of the best and most accommodating lodging I have stayed at. It was a little difficult to find this place, but once we did, the workers at the hotel were extremely friendly. It was a beautiful place. The staff was always checking up on us and making sure we didnât need anything. Anytime we left the hotel, They would give us a phone and instructions on how to be found in case we got lost in the city. Good breakfast and restaurant in spa. Beautifully redone. Had pools, courtyards, nice gardens. Far enough from the city to be quiet but close enough that everything was walking distance. If I come back, I would definitely stay here again. Thank you for an amazing time Elena, Amal, Safae!;5
Very good location  Very good service : They let me make calls without charge out of regulations , supplied immediately unusual accessories  for the room  , assisted in planning the New York events program for the one week vacation .;5
Everything you read about this Riad is true. The four of us were staying in 2 of their basic rooms but they were beautiful & had everything we needed and more. Both had an inside & outside seating area and walk in showers. What stood out the most was the exceptional service. Nothing was too much trouble & I would like to thank the staff for making our stay so wonderful.  The Riad itself is beautiful , so peaceful & there were always plenty of seats & sun beds to relax after a busy day in the MÃ©dina . We had s guide on our first day organised by the Riad & I would highly recommend this. We also had a Moroccan dinner at the Riad on our first night on the roof top & it was perfect. Breakfast was plentiful & could be served where you wanted.  If returning to Marrakech, I would have;5
The room was fair for the price, and the location is great! The hotel staff was very welcoming and happy to help. From my arrival, the front desk left a good impression. The doorman, Tommy, was a great help and always great to see. Hope to see him again on my next trip. And will definitely recommend this spot to colleagues.;5
This is our second time staying at the empire hotel in NYC.  We arrived earlier than our designated check-in time which was no problem as they offered to store our bags.  Location is great for us.  10-15 min walk to times square.  Everything else is further away but the hotel is very quiet due to not being in that much of a busy area.  Lots of local shops nearby and a Starbucks right down stairs.  Rooms are small but nothing out of the ordinary for New York.  Very clean and modern with enough storage to keep all your clothing etc.  Large TV and Wi-Fi in rooms.  The beds are incredibly comfortable.  Bathroom & shower is great, very clean.  The maids do a great job.  Overall, the rooms are small but doesn't cause much of a concern.  Staff are great, very helpful and didn't have to;5
Staying at the Riad Keirredine was an incredible experience.  From the moment we walked in, we were treated like Sultans.  From the constant flow of Moroccan tea to the rose water towels to even the delicious breakfast - the experience at Riad Kheirredine was the epitome of opulence.  The staff was amazing friendly and resourceful for all of our needs.  if I ever make it back to Marrakech, I would choose the same lodging.;5
I recently booked a block of rooms through Michelle at the Empire and thanks to her, our stay was fantastic! Our group loved the amenities, and the hotel even provided our guests with red velvet cupcakes! Thank you Michelle for making our stay excellent.;5
The bunkbed rooms may be small and the airco noisy, but this is amply compensated by the helpful staff, the lovely interior, the clean rooms and communal bathrooms and the unique retrovibe atmosphere. The rooftop terrace offers a beautiful view over the Hudson and the free bike rental available for hotel guests offers a great way to discover NYC. The hotel is located in a quiet street, and even though in the weekends the hotel cafÃ© turns into a popular club, this didn't interfere at all with our night's rest. The bunkbed rooms are perfect for shorter stays due to the small size, but the larger rooms should be able to accommodate you for a longer trip. All that, and the pricing is also very appealing. All in all definitely a place to happily come back to when returning to NYC!;5
Its very rare that somewhere lives up to such high expectations from all the glowing reviews. But Riad Kheirredine and all its amazing staff still managed to exceed our expectations. We were 2 couples caught in covid cancellation world but thankfully it was simply a postponement. From the moment we first booked, all through covid times and trying to rebook and to our final stay the Riad staff excelled.  The Riad is an oasis of calm within the hussle and bustle of an amazing city. Every time you enter the front door you are so pampered in a genuine and friendly way. The Riad is beautiful, there's always a secluded space to relax - you might think you are the only guests. But its the staff that make your holiday, they simply can not do enough to make your stay perfect. A big;5
We enjoyed our three nights of  accommodations. Our family of four ate the hot buffet every morning before heading out to the parks as well as dinner two nights at Five on the Hill. Javier (Mexico) was the best at both locations. Friendly team & great customer service. Weâll definitely return.;5
Clean remodeled room. Good window insulation no noises from the planes. Big size tv. Very nice showers with bathroom supplies also has a Starbucks coffee. There is parking available at the hotel for around $40 per or self parking next building for $15 per night. Would recommend to others.;5
The hotel was affordable and clean, and the reception staff, particularly Jeff, were exceedingly friendly and accommodating. When I first arrived at the hotel, Jeff greeted me very warmly and spent a lot of time showing me a map of walking destinations around Manhattan! He also set me up with transportation back to the airport for my last day. Jeff was the most notable part of my hotel experience. He made me feel very comfortable and taken care of.;5
After reading previous reviews of this Riad I expected it to be good, but I honestly didn't expect it to be off the scale in every area. We had never been to Morocco before and had booked 4 nights at Riad Kheirredine, when we arrived the Riad staff were waiting for us at the taxi drop to escort us through the labyrinth of streets that take you to the Riad. Once there we were greeted by Valentina who was so friendly and wanted to ensure we had  the best experience possible she gave us phones in case we got lost and told us to call any of the numbers given at any time day or night if we needed help..We have been to many hotels over the years, some very expensive but I have never felt so looked after.. Our guide Ishmael (forgive the spelling) was wonderful he had grown up in the;5
Beautiful riad in the medina short walk to the souks.  Staff is fantastic and speak good Engnlish.  They took care of everything we asked for from walking us to and from the riad when we needed assistance (it's impossible to find till you get yourself acclimated to the neighborhood ).  Arranging transport.  Booking train tickets.  Even helping us get a bag to carry our beautiful morrocan lantern we spent hours shopping for.     Having them give you a local cell was great so we could call for our taxi back from the new town where most of the nicer restaurants and bars are.    The terrace is a wonderful location for your free breakfast and any meals you choose to eat with the riad with  two levels, lots of sitting areas and a small pool.;5
A perfect hotel especially if you're flying in for a concert or two at The Forum.  We drove in to see Pearl Jam two nights in a row and the hotel served it's purpose.  Obviously it was very close to the airport (saw the glowing LED columns at LAX right outside our room), but it was not a bad drive to The Forum either.  The only thing that would have made it a little better was if they had a hot tub/spa by the pool.;5
Room was impeccable, the decor was great.  Loved the the energy efficient settings. We also enjoyed the shuttle service to/from the hotel.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Excellent stay and will be back in the future;5
"The title of my review really says most of what I wanted to express. The New Yorker is an Iconic Manhattan hotel; I would be disappointed at having to stay anywhere else (except maybe the Waldorf Astoria).   The thing that makes this hotel so appealing is it's history and design. It is a hotel for the people, at very affordable prices, but with service and pedigree second to none.   Please do your research before you stay here, and understand how significant this place is. It's an art-deco masterpiece, with rooms dedicated to the geniuses Muhammad Ali and Nikola Tesla, who both stayed at this hotel, Ali ti recuperate after his fight with Frazier at Madison Square Garden (just across the street on the corner of 34th), and Tesla, who lived in room 3327 for ten years until he died";5
Stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker because of its location to Madison square garden to watch the New York Rangers. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are small but adequate, clean and quiet. The hotel has a art deco charm. The only issue we had was with the key card but was quickly and easily sorted.  And the luggage check in on our last day was really helpful and a good price.;5
Surprising, friendly and charming are some of the adjectives that first come to mind. Detail oriented, personalized service and relaxing after our day long walks, would also be deserving of this beautifully restored property. The food was wonderful while enjoying the evening at the riad as well. The citie's skyline along with the magic captured within the walls was worth staying in for dinner.;5
First of all the staff is so super friendly and helpful. At the moment we checked in (early checkin)  we were even offered a breakfast which is incredible. The room looks exactly as on the pictures. We had twice dinner in our Riad and the food was very good and nice call atmosphere. Something incredible is, that you can have coffee, tea or fresh orange juice 24 hour a day! This is giving the extra touch. Location is very good to explore the Medina. A special thanks to siham from reception we felt like being part of this family. All the waiters did excellent job and are paying attention to details. Special thanks to Hassan, Youssef and Mehdi. If you want a wonderful Riad experience you have to stay here. We would come back anytime!;5
Wonderful location right across from Central Park. Amazingly affordable, so I was a bit apprehensive, but the staff is very courteous, the hallway as well as the room was spotless,  and it was nice and quiet. I met a number of young 20-somethings in the elevator during my stay. They came from as far away as Australia and some nice guys from Mississippi. The hotel seems to attract a very nice clientele. I will certainly be going back to stay at the Astor.;5
The staff went above and beyond to make our stay extremely comfortable, easy and safe! They are first-class and the absolute best hospitality and service we received during our vacation -- they exceeded all expectations. We were a group of 3 ladies, so were a bit apprehensive about navigating Marrakech, but the riad managers made our trip fantastic. They provided a complimentary local mobile phone, coordinated walking escorts for us to all our destinations and even contacted all of our pre-organized guides ahead of time to confirm proper pick-up details within the medina --- just amazing! On top of that, we were very satisfied with our suite accommodations. Marrakech and all the other places we visited across Morocco were fascinating and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to;5
Very nice and comfortable hotel room!! The staff is professional and efficient, the service was nice and helped us a lot. The room was clean and our king bed very comfy ( deluxe lines) and soft pillows, we had a great sleep.  I want to thank Sonia , for making our stay so great, she was excellent preparing our breakfast, her service was very welcoming. We would definitely return, great value.;5
"I stayed here for four days before and three days after my ""Groove Cruise LA"". Hotel was clean and tidy and welcoming. Location is good. For English people it is within walking distance to the closest metro and some bars and restaurants further north on N. Vermont Ave. However as previous reviews say you do need a car when visiting LA. I did find the parking to be a little expensive but room rates were lower than other hotels, Breakfast was epic there was so much choice. I did become a fan of the early morning 8am bowl of granola and come back before 10 for some eggs/omelette or waffles. Our first room which was situated on the ground floor room was amazing shower was huge TV good picture and a good selection of channels. There was free Wi-Fi but was spread over 5/6 different";5
we stayed a couple of days/night perfect place to relax...great place or should I say great hideaway to escape stressful environment. Very accomodating staffs, amenities are great Hope to get back here in our next vacation. see you soon!;5
The room was excellent and once I got to the front desk to check in it went smoothly.  The security team is right on the ball checking everyone.  The lobby restaurants were excellent this year.  Rooms were clean and well stocked.  Beds a bit soft, but the water pressure and available hot water was good.  Overall a decent price for NYC and the location is great.  The taxes will shock you.  The lobby very comfortable and nice.  Overall I would suggest this hotel especially if you have business in the Garden area.;5
We stayed here when coming into New York to attend an event at the Lincoln Center. The hotel is nice, and located right across the street from the Lincoln Center, making it very convenient. Several good restaurants within a block are open until late for a late night supper after the event, followed by a visit to the rooftop bar of the hotel. A very pleasant stay for a night or weekend in the city.;5
From arrival till departure, the staff, the hotel and the stay was beautiful.  With the location so close to Universal studio, it was a bang for my buck.  Room was very clean, comfortable, staff at restaurant were very accommodating even though we were late.  Love the free shuttle service to Universal studio.;5
We stayed for my daughters birthday and took the shuttle to and from Universal and City Walk multiple times.  Wait was no more than 10 minutes and all the drivers were very nice.  The young lady at check-in (Astrid I believe) was very helpful in getting our rooms close together and was even able to get one of our rooms an early check-in.  We had snacks and drinks in the lounge one night and again - excellent service.  We have season passes to Universal now so we will definitely be back!  Thank you to all the staff!!!;5
I stay at about 4-5 hotels a year. This by fat was the best place I ever stayed. Every single hotel employee treated my family like royalty. My wife had her purse stolen while we were at the city walk. Every member of the hotel staff we encountered did every thing they could to help. I never thought I could receive such top notch service from a hotel. One of the mangers asked me what could they do to improve customer service. I have no idea what they could do to improve. You spend a year planning and saving for vacation. All you want in return is a pleasant stay. I got way more than that. Great job. Thank you for all you do to make guests feel aprrecietted. I have no imeddiette plans to return to LA but I want to do so soon just so I can stay here again.;5
Very comfortable and clean room,window you can open, Near the breakfast room,you could get free coffee or tea in the morning,even tea or coffee specials! Location perfect! No noises from the floor or other rooms,only street noise by open window (8 floor) The rainfall shower was amazing!  Very helpful and friendly staff,special the porter Jeff! Would stay there certainly again!;5
I entered the hotel and was immediately greeted by the doorman, he directed me to the help desk and I was welcomed by Aniana. She was such a sweetheart, she was very respectful and courteous. I felt like a son to her and it was very warming. She was just perfect. Thank you Aniana for your honest help and courtesy. I wish you nothing short of the best, thank you again for how you treated me. If she has any room left for promotion, she deserves it for sure. God bless you and thank you for welcoming to the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel.;5
The staff is extremely friendly especially Jesse, the concierge. I had an issue  with my electronics tickets not being delivered and he made calls, printed them out and then proceeded to tell us of which order to ride rides and the overall experience. He is always smiling and so helpful. Also, the gentleman running Peetâs coffee was so friendly each morning. Rooms were spacious, comfortable, clean and convenient to park.;5
We stayed the night before our early LAX flight. Check in and out were a breeze. The hotel is modern and clean. The room was spacious and quiet even though you are right next to airport. The shuttle to the airport was convent and we were picked up right away did not have to wait. Great stay.;5
Very clean rooms on the smaller size and we had supposedly a view of the city,  more a view of the rooms across from us on another wing of the hotel Easy access to broadway uptown or downtown, centrally located. Macyâs , Madison Square Garden within 1-3 blocks walking.;5
Visually appealing riad with wonderful Moroccan-Italian fusion breakfasts included and delicious Moroccan dinners if you choose. Italian owned and operated with a staff fluent in English and French as well as Arabic and Italian. Rooms are a bit small but well appointed. You will be supplied with a phone pre-programmed with the numbers of the hotel and various staff members that you may use to order breakfast and snacks or to summons assistance if you are lost. Staff members, led by effervescent and eager to please Valentina, are, without exception, warm and helpful. Highly recommended.;5
everything worked gerat, the room needs a little refreshment, but it is very clean and safe. Location is perfect for sightseeing, hoping etc. Hells Kitchen in walking distance, mmhhhhhh. We had really a great time and very quiet sleep.;5
I gave my wife this get quick trip as a Christmas present.  We had a quick get away to NYC to take in the sights and see a Broadway show.  The hotel was quiet clean and in a great midtown location.  The front desk clerk, Mohammed, was very helpful and checked in with us to make sure everything was in order.  Outstanding experience!;5
I have stayed here 4 times since my son moved to LA in the summer of 2011.  It has become my home away from home, with my most recent visit, Christmas 2014.  I love Hollywood Hotel!  My husband, Tom, has come to LA with me the last two times and he loves the wonderful breakfast omelettes and waffles made to order for him and served every morning.  The entire breakfast crew, especially Hugo & Sonia, are the best cooks and servers, working hard to make the hotel guests their number one priority.  Great job!  Michael has the in-hotel store where you can purchase t-shirts for family and he will make sure you have what you need, whatever size and color.  He may have an odd item even if it is not on display!  Jermaine is priceless at the front desk.  Others that I know that offer;5
This review is long overdue -- My boyfriend and I stayed for a few days at Riad Kheirredine in March and had a terrific experience.  The rooms were stylish, well equipped, and cleaned daily. (loved the welcome cookies they provided too: Cornes de Gazelle that I later went on a mission to find and bring back to the states).  Breakfast was amazing-- each morning you can choose to order whatever you want from their menu, and have it served in the dining room, your own room, or even rooftop.  Dinner options are pretty standard Moroccan fare, but their tagine was one of the best I had during my trip.  The riad has wifi too, strong enough that I was able to handle a work emergency in the middle of my trip.    While I haven't stayed at many riads, I think what makes this one really;5
Absolutely wonderful stay for my company. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The events manager was such a pleasant man and super nice. Hotel food was delicious and plenty of it! Great central location, about a 10 minute walk to Empire State, Times Square and the edge. Stayed in the suite room on the 40th floor and the views of Manhattan were incredible. Felt like I was in a palace! Rooms were very clean and immaculate. Security at the hotel is very good, they make sure you have your room card as soon as you enter the elevators to go up. The only disadvantage I would say is that you have to wait a long time for the elevators as it stops on almost every floor. Thank you very much for the stay and would definitely recommend to anyone whether itâs couples/families/business.;5
The hotel is literally across the main entrance to Universal, you have to walk more from some of the parking spots for Universal Studios than from this hotel. In addition, service was fantastic and amenities are great with good prices. It is the closest hotel to Universal hands down. In addition, because it is so close, we had the luxury of going to hotel to change and then walk out to dinner again to city walk.  Stay here if you can!;5
We are just back from a 5 night stay. Location was great. Room was a nice size and clean.  Kids enjoyed the pool at night. We loved that we could walk to the park and City Walk. Staff was helpful. I know I've read complaints about the elevators but we had no issues at all.  I would recommend to anyone!;5
"My wife and I stayed 5 nights at the Riad. Our room was the ""Fleur d'oranger"" which we loved. The Riad onyl has a few rooms so it is never over crowded with other clients. Riad also features many different areas to relax, or sun bath. On top of the amazing room, I can honestly say the service was well above our expectations: - Rooms are cleaned twice a day. - the riad offers each of its costumer a phone and has a call center  for you to call in case you get lost or are in need of help. - the riad also has doorkeepers to guide each of their clients through the medina, which is a must at least at the beginning. - Breakfast is served free of charged every morning and was very good - fruits are available for free all around the Riad. - the riad planned and booked all our activities";5
We stayed 8 nights, 2 adults and  2 teenagers. We would definitely recommend this hotel to our family and friends. The hotel is near a metro station and so ideale to explore Hollywood Walk of Fame, Universal Studios, .... On a little walking distance you can find first aid, supermarket, several eat facilities, ... The hotel crew was very friendly and helpful. The room was nice, clean and very spacious (+++ coffee and tea in the room, a microwave). Also a lot of facilities e.g. Sauna, Fitness, hotelshop, swimming pool, car rental service, ....;5
"Reasonably priced for the location, within close proximity of a metro station, situated across the street from the Lincoln Center, restaurants, bars, jazz clubs, the Empire Hotel can""t be beat. You literally don""t need to move more than a block in any direction to sample what New York City has to offer!";5
Our Visit To LA was made extremely memorable due to the perfect location of the hotel to Public Transport and the Personalised service offered by all staff at the Hollywood Hotel. Hugo did an amazing job with the breakfast and was extremely efficient getting all the hot food served and doing it all with a smile. Gisel and Daisy were always so professional in the way they greeted guests and extremely helpful with customer inquiries and extremely accommodating. We will definitely staying at the Hollywood Hotel when we are back in LA.;5
The hotel is unexpectedly comfortable. The area is questionable but the staff helps you feel welcome. Pil is above the rest. Through my stay he was the only one that never asked for a review. When I approached him he was genuine and helpful even when worked back to back days.   The hotel provides breakfast but as much as itâs hyped up the chef is kinda of rude if you ask him for any extra. Since the area is downstairs you do walk away with a heavy odor or musk. But itâs worth it since you get home made breakfast.  The pool is spacious but you will get killed by the mosquitoes. But Pil did warn us and gave us some mosquito repellent wipes.   Overall the Hotel is comfortable, the staff is pushy for reviews, but regardless some staff do earn it, like the maids, the cooks and some;5
Modern rooms, this place should definitely be on your list of great hotels. The beds are very comfortable and the restaurant is amazing offering healthy, delicious choices for every type of appetite and lifestyle.  Just call for your car from your room and itâs waiting for you. So easy and convenient.  Will stay there again!;5
I have to say, I do understand the reviews that the hotel is a little basic etc, but you have to remember how much you actually paid to stay in MANHATTAN!!!!  I visited New York City for 10 nights from the UK with a friend on mine for my 21st Birthday. It was the trip of the lifetime and we only used the hotel to sleep and shower, which I presumed is what others would do whilst visiting Manhattan... Obviously I'm mistaken?  Our room was huge, a double and single bed, kitchenette area, dressing area and large enough bathroom for 2 guests. I personally just could not get over the location. It was unreal - $2.50 subway ride from Time Square, 30 minute walk to the Natural History museum and Central Park. Tonnes of places to eat and drink near by the hotel. Across the road from the;5
The hotel is in a fantastic place, we were just around the corner from the Empire State Building so we were extra lucky to be able to see the different lights at the top of the Empire State Building every evening!  The maids came and cleaned our room daily, she was lovely and liked to sing while she worked.  The staff in the entrance lobby were so friendly and immediately made us feel welcome!  They were always happy to answer any questions we had.  If you want somewhere to eat We recommend the IGK cafe that is just up the street from the Hotel, very reasonably priced and the food is nice too. Plus is does a good cup of tea.   Thank you to everyone from The New Yorker for a very memorable holiday :);5
The hotel has the right amount of amenities to make one feel comfortable and the size of the property and the interior patio and outside bar gives the hotel a Hollywood charm. Breakfast was outstanding every morning and the lounge offers free entertainment from wanna be comics. Rooms are large and of good value. The best part, was the rental car service at the hotel. They pick you up at the airport at no charge and take you to the hotel where you can conveniently get your car at competitive rates.;5
We stayed during NYFW, it was super busy in the hotel.  The staff was excellent, and treated everyone with respect.  We had a few questions, and they were answered very nicely. We did Valet park our Chevy Traverse which cost us 70.00. It was easy to do, and took that city parking stress away from our trip which we loved!! (Retrieving the vehicle at the end was super smooth as well)  There was a dog show in the hotel, so there were dogs everywhere.  I do have an allergy to them, but it never seemed to bother me.  Our double bed room was super clean, the bathroom was small, but had the antique faucets and door knobs, that took you back in time.  The view out of our window was of the Empire State building , I sat for hours looking at it during the night.  There was noise from the;5
Love this hotel in all its former glamour and glory. Location opposite Madison sq gardens, Penn station. View of empire state and times sq..both about 5-10 mins walk away. Stayed from 27 nov to 3 december. Loved NYC..thankyou hotel great stay warm and clean plus beautiful tree and decorations;5
We referred to Riad Kheirredine as our Oasis during our 7 night stay at this delightful and beautiful Riad.  It truly is a respite from the busy and hot city outside its walls.  The service is renowned (actually rated the #1 Service Hotel on the entire planet on one survey a couple years ago).  I could go on and on and on about it.  Valentina and all the staff were truly amazing and responsive.  Ask and ye shall receive. Yes they go WAY out of their way to try and make you happy.  Etc, Etc Etc.  However, I will add that we had problems with our flights as we were leaving Marrakech.  Elena was on the phone with my wife, working out flights, helping us communicate with airport staff, walking us through the process.....as if we were family.  We had already checked out of the;5
We've reviewed this hotel on two other occasions... always giving it 5 stars.  And another 5 stars we give it again!  We travel as a family, and by far this is the best value for a reasonably priced suite we've found in the city, especially being so close to main attractions.  We had a GREAT corner room with TWO spectacular views of the city (Empire State Building out one side, and Madison Square Garden on the other). This time we made a visit to the lower level to check out the history exhibit of the hotel (displayed near the gym).  Fascinating! If you have a chance, check it out.  You're staying at a true piece of history when you book a room at The New Yorker!;5
This Hilton was an easy walk to Universal.  They do offer complimentary tram service as well, but the walk was enjoyable and quick, even after a full day at the park.  As far as the hotel itself, the rooms were clean and comfortable.  The staff was most friendly and accommodating.  We will definitely be back.  While the price was higher then other Hiltons we have visited, it was well worth it.  All in all, a most pleasant and welcoming stay.;5
This hotel was great! The staff were all happy and friendly especially on the information desk. The hotel was overall great but some areas could do with upgrades. Regardless you couldnât get a better location! Penn station directly outside and times square straight up the road. We had a fantastic and will be coming back next year.;5
"We were lucky enough to book Riad Kheirredine for our first few days in Morocco; the hotel itself is a fantastic introduction to the country but the folks who run the place are the real treasure!  Elena, Asmara, Waleed...every single person working at Kheirredine make it their job to make your stay a success.  Literally, ""your wish is our command."" Cocktails on the roof, coffee and steamed milk in your room, delightful breakfasts and delicious dinners...not to be beat anywhere in the world.  The rooms and premises are glamorous and luxurious, clean as a pin.  Thank you to everyone who helped us get settled into our visit to this beautiful country.  It is a genuinely beautiful place with wonderfully kind and helpful people.";5
My husband & I visited NY at the end of February & stayed at this hotel. It was fantastic! Rooms cleaned daily, staff always helpful & friendly and the lobby always clean & tidy. The hotel is ideally located within walking distance of a lot of tourist attractions such as the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square & Macyâs. We had a wonderful time at The New Yorker Hotel. Would thoroughly recommend.;5
You might find a Riad that is fancier or closer to the Souk but you won't find a nicer place to stay with better staff.  We felt so welcomed by the wonderful staff and so very pampered by them.  The Riad is beautiful, very clean, in a quiet part of the Medina.  Your every need will be well taken care of, always there was someone available to guide you to and from your desired location.  The food was wonderful.  When you returned from a hard day of sightseeing orange juice and snacks were always waiting.  It seemed like the staff couldn't do enough for us, they were genuinely nice, not just playing being nice.  Our room was not one of the largest but it was elegant and beautiful and always kept perfectly clean.  What more could a traveler ask for?;5
Rooms were a nice size and very clean. Beds were very comfortable. They have room darkening shades so if you want to sleep late you can. The rooftop bar is very nice, I hope that I get to back over the summer so that I can really enjoy it. The staff was very courteous & professional. Hotel is very close to the subway & a couple of really good restaurants.;5
Sara and the staff were simply superb. Excellent service and spa treatments. Simply perfect. The top-roof restaurant (with pool) is stunning and the food was delicious. The room was huge and perfectly cleaned twice a day. Just five minutes walk from the heart of the medina. Fantastic;5
My husband got sick in our last 24hours in LA and we had to cancel our flights home to NZ by 24hrs. Booked within 1hour online. The staff were very kind and caring! Helping me moving bags and making sure we had everything we needed! Room was a king size, very clean. I have a grilled sandwich for dinner, room service for breakfast and the whole lot only cost $200.  The have a shuttle that runs every 15mins to the airport. Only a 2min drive.;5
This is an amazing place. It is charming, beautiful and the staff is wonderful without being overbearing. I travel a lot as I have a small import business. As a woman, it is important for me to feel safe. It was about a 10 minute walk to the souks, I eventually leatned my way but un tip I did, I was given a phone to call and someone would meet me and walk me back! The food was amazing, and do carve out time to sit on the roof. Such a treat. I had breakfast there last day. I should have done it every day!!!;5
Aye que guapo Pil !!!! Thatâs a shout out to you Pil. Thanks for making our anniversary extra special. The hotel is so caring with celebrating special events. Everyone makes you feel at home and part of the family. Donât miss out on the breakfast. A+++++++ hotel.;5
Great location right across the street from Lincoln Center and walking distance to Central Park, Columbus Square, and several museums. Friendly helpful staff. The only downside is that there is no hotel restaurant, so no room service. Other than that, it's a great value for a really nice hotel.;5
Perfect location, the staff been nothing but amazing especially Alejandra, she accommodated us beautifully and her amazing sense of humour! The rooms are amazingly spacious and everything was phenomenal! Visiting again for sure;5
Nice big room, asked for coffee maker at check in and it was in my room quickly.  Check in staff and room security were all very helpful and professional.  Easy 4 block walk to Javitz Center.  Many restaurants and Delis within a block or two.  Starbucks right across the street.;5
We stayed here on our trip to Universal Studios Hollywood. This is a very nice hotel. The room was large and very nice and clean. We had an amazing view of downtown LA and the park from our 23rd floor room. Our rate included breakfast, pretty basic. So we upgraded to the hot breakfast for an extra $10. It was very good. They have a shuttle to the park, however the walk was about 5 mins. Parking was $28 a day, kinda sucks considering the room charge. They also made us leave the parking lot at 6pm when the park was open until 7pm. If we'd stayed they said $12 an hour extra. Again for the room charge and parking charge it would be nice if they'd do their homework and let guest stay until the park closes without the extra charge.  That would be my only issue, the staff and property;5
We visited here as part of our 10th anniversary. I requested some beer for our room as a present for my husband. What they provided went above and beyond. They couldn't have done any more to make our stay more perfect. We had a room which had a balcony and the most amazing view. It was situated about a 20min walk from Times Square. It was next to both train and tube station.  Thanks to all involved in our stay.;5
New York being very expensive, we managed to find this hidden gem..... it was around $80 Aus each per night which is just a bit more than a hostel! And you get your own bathroom... AND IT IS SO CLEAN! We were so surprised how clean the room was... I mean it is very tiny as you would expect it to be in NY.... but we were really happy with it. Just a few blocks from the subway (the subway is very safe) and about 10-15 mins to Times Square it was great! I mean if you want to stay where it all happens... go ahead and pay $250 a night... OR save the money and do awesome things in New York - like see a broadway show for just $65 Aus (you have to line up at 6pm in Times Square, but you get excellent seats!) or go shopping on 5th Avenue! You should only be sleeping in your hotel as;5
I stayed at this hotel for 8 days during march 2010 and I was very surprised at the quality of the hotel despite the cheap price. The hotel is located almost at the northern end of Central Park, right below Harlem, the neighbourhood was nice and there are several 24 hour shops, bars and places to eat within 1 block (my recommendation is 110th street West, where there is a fantastic soul food place). The rooms are indeed small but it was very clean and the bed is a big comfortable double bed. The bathroom was tiny but it was clean and the bathtub and shower was fantastic, the staff was even kind enough to explain to me how to turn on the shower as I wasn't too sure. The rooms were also cleaned daily with fresh sheets and towels being provided, the cleaning lady I got ( a spanish;5
"In my 25+ years of travel, I have never experienced such a high level of customer service as I have from the staff at this hotel.  I could not go anywhere in the hotel without a staff person asking me if there was anything I needed or anything they could help me with.  My stay there was during a time when the hotel was at or near capacity, so I appreciated this personal attention even more.  Stewart G., in particular, is a very high-quality professional!  Other staff were helpful in offering me recommendations on what to do during my week away from home and helping me navigate the hotel conference area.    My room was a corner alcove; I had a beautiful view of the San Fernando Valley as well as Universal Studios.  I was quite comfortable with this option.  The only negative I";5
Just arrived back from staying at this hotel and it was so lovely, rooms clean and tidy, beds so comfy, slept really well. Staff very friendly, polite and helpful.  Walking  distance to Time square, Central Park and Empire State, Would highly recommend this hotel, would definitely stay here again. Thank you ðð;5
this hotel is one of the best i have ever stayed in i cant belive some of the other ratings it has got.The place was very clean and in a great location.;5
Very noce and clean place.. Pil helped me with everything, he was very nice and helped to get around the city too. The area where is located is very nice and easy to get everywhere in the city. Iâll be back for sure!;5
Huge shout out to Hugo and Danny from maintenance! Had an issue with my dadâs ECV &  in less than 10 minutes they were at my room door & got it figured out! My stay was already going great, but them just going above & beyond to help my family out really convinces me that this is my go to hotel from now on!! Props to them saving my families trip!!;5
Exceptional service and room Great location and value with a very polite friendly staff from the reception to the room attendant . The helpful doorman and very welcoming attitude was appreciated . Breakfast was on a rooftop, coffee was hot and smooth . I would definitely come back. This was my second stay here.;5
My husband and I stayed here for 3 days while in Morocco. We have traveled all over the world but the amazing attentive staff truly made our stay in Marrakech one of the best experiences we have ever had!  Even before we arrived, we were contacted by staff members who offered guidance on visiting Marrakech. Upon our arrival, we could tell that the staff genuinely wanted to help make our stay an amazing experience. They arranged transportation for us to and from the airport, arranged a guided tour of the city, arranged taxi rides for us at a fixed rate, and they offered to send us out with a guide to help navigate the streets of the Medina. They also offer guests a complimentary cellphone which is programmed to call the Riad if you needed help with anything.   Whether you wanted;5
Great location, the corner rooms are especially nice with lots of room. We had 1570 and friends had 1758, both corner rooms with nice views (1570 overlooks Universal Theme Park). The staff was helpful, internet access was adequate (it was provided free for our conference so I don't know what the cost is), conference rooms were good but there isn't very modern A/V equipment built-in as it is an old hotel.;5
Found the Riad on TripAdvsor after our initial plans had to change at the last minute: thought that I was going to be settling for a mediocre place: how wrong I was.  My wife and I were there for a two night stay, second night we had romantic dinner at the Riad on their roof terrace (recommended, food compared well to Le Foundouk restaurant). I cannot stress how hard the hotel staff work behind the scenes to ensure that their guests have an effortless, rewarding & enjoyable stay.  Traveling to the Medina is actually not all that easy: the cool Riads are NOT going to be easy to find (and this one REALLY isn't), you might get hassled at night, you might not select the best hamam or restaurant.  The Kheirredine staff come to carry your bags to the Riad when you first arrive at one;5
Just finished a 45 day trip to South America. Did not want to fly home same day we got off the boat so we stayed at the Hyatt LAX. Easy access to LAX. Free shuttle. Free WiFi. Nice large room with 2 king-size beds. Restaurant is not the best but convenient.;5
My hotel stay was great.  The room was very clean, comfortable, up-to-date and quiet. The staff at check-in and check-out were wonderful. The food at the restaurant was very good.  The driver of the shuttle to LAX was excellent.;5
I just stayed at The Empire Hotel and the staff and hotel were absolutely amazing!  I was their for business and pleasure with my family and they went out of their way to accommodate us.  The room was perfect and everyone at the hotel could not be nicer.  Thank you to Nicole, Gunita, Heather and Zunachy for your excellent customer service. I highly recommend staying at this fabulous hotel!;5
"We stayed at the Empire because it was the closest to Lincoln Center and the rates were good.  Everything exceeded our expectations. Their interior decorating was ""now' and the service and advise was supurb!  The view from our bedroom window was of a park and Lincoln Center! I've been told that there is a place on the roof to relax and sip wine and we are going to return to the Empire in early June to sip!";5
"One of the best boutique hotels we stayed in, the staff is very friendly, attentive and willing to help. The breakfast was the highlight of our stay, a varity of delicious moroccan pancakes,fruit salad, hot/cold drinks and alot more, the best part is that you can have it at anytime and anywhere in the Riad, just say where and they will take care of you.  The Riad itself is well decorated, the rooms are cleaned twice per day, the laundry service is FREE and they have bellboys to accompagne you whenever you are going out to give you directions.  The service in general is beyond perfect. We will definitely come back as soon as we can for more exploring and activities.  Also, try their SPA you will be relaxed as never before ;)  Thank you for everyone who made our stay smooth and";5
Great location, service, style, and price.  Close to everything (walked to many NY sites and landmarks and Broadway), old NY charm, and close to Penn Station.  Would definitely stay here again.  Gave AAA member discount.;5
We upgraded to penthouse for extra 120 dollars for the week .Huge roon bigger than most Nyc apartments. There was a fault with tv a bit hit and miss ..But who goes to NY to watch tv ? .will deffo be back thanks for a great stay .Sarah and Brendan;5
It's all about the location, location, location. It is 5 minutes walking distance from Times Square and 10 minutes walking distance to Central Park. When we arrived, we got a free upgrade to a junior suite! The service was amazing. Janet and Majid were amazing and the room was perfect with all amendaties needed.   Definitely recommend to anyone who wishes to visit Manhattan, New York a couple of days!;5
For 2 travelers to feel safe from NYC to L.A. it just took to walk into the Hollywood Hotel. Nelson at the desk put all our worries at ease. We are now in a nice room overlooking their beautiful courtyard for the next 3 nights! ð;5
I recently stayed at the Morningside Inn in New York City and was absolutely impressed with the staff and the accommodations for such a facility that was not known to me.  I was especially impressed with the Managers ability to get me a room on such short notice and have his staff get it ready.  I believe his name is Patrick.  A great job for a facility not well known.;5
Hello I have been to many riads in Marrakech, but honestly Riad Khaireddine is beautiful and remains one of the best Riads in Marrakech. Elegance, decor, music everywhere and staff. Among the things I liked a lot was the rooftop view which has a panoramic view of Marrakech and the wonderful pool. Because it is difficult to find a swimming pool in a riad in Marrakech and on the roof, and your allowance is the size.andÂ  We will not forget the most romantic restaurant. Thank you to the team for such a wonderful stay. note They do not accept visiting or entering the restaurant, only for residents;5
this hotel was very pleasant with cool exclusive design lobby, elegant comfortable rooms(but quite small), excellent service and friendly staff. a bit pricy but I love the rooftop bar and pool. will def be back!;5
"My granddaughter said, ""Wow! Grandma"" when we entered the lobby.  We had an upgraded room due to being a member of Hilton Points.  It was roomy with comfortable beds.  Warm swimming pool open until late for use after the theme park.";5
The Empire will treat you well.  Luis took care of us when we arrived.  The rooms are modernized and comfortable.  The pool deck looks great for the warmer months.  It's well located next to the Opera House near Central Park and Times Square.;5
Group of 6 traveling to Marrakech for a 3 night break... Where better to stay! From the moment we entered this Riad we wanted for nothing! Nothing was to much trouble, and every request was catered for, even takeaway pizza before we left for the airport :) An amazing experience!! ,,, would love to return,,Thanks to you all!!;5
We attended the restaurant of the Premier Inn County Hall and the waiting staff Danish & Jannut weâre both friendly, helpful & professional, as a family we enjoyed our evening meal and based on our first impression we decided that we would eat all our evening meals here for the duration of our stay.;5
The location of this hotel couldn't be better for seeing Manhattan. The subway is across the street and we walked to Times Square/Rockefeller centre in around 20 minutes. It's also by a lovely bit of the park and the ice rink if it the right time of year. Hotel itself was lovely, a few little upgrades needed here and there but nothing major. Staff were very nice and accommodating, bar tenders in particular were helpful and friendly. The only thing I would say is during our 10 day stay we enquired about the rooftop bar on 5 different evenings and it was booked for private function every time. This is perfectly understandable as it was mid December, but we asked the concierge in the day time once or twice and he wasn't aware of any functions, then by that evening it was closed off;5
Love it here. The staff were very helpful and our room was excellent. Really happy we found this place to stay for two nights. Have work the next day, had reservations moving rooms and they completely went out of their way to help.  Also ample parking in the back for much less than a parking ticket = );5
The hotel is great, modern and with great views. The rooms are huge and so are the bathrooms. They offer free shuttle to Universal Studios and self parking, which for me was a great surprise. They offered us a continental breakfast and it was delicious! The service was great!;5
Very good service, Beautiful hotel. Staff were efficient and friendly. Everything spotless as expected from Hilton. Very comfortable stay. Restaurant offer a great breakfast buffet or from the menu. dinner buffet are excellent. Although there is a shuttle to Universal Studios.;5
Great hotel overall and would recommend this hotel to others.  Positives:  Location is great for sight seeing and generally travelling around the city.  Nice, clean and light room,  friendly staff.  Negative:  We could hear a lot of noise from outside, from our room and this made it difficult to sleep at night  although I am not sure if this is the case with lots of NYC hotels?  No free Wifi in rooms Recommendations:  The Smith restaurant just opposite hotel is  great for Brunch.  Central Park entrance is a couple of roads away and easy to walk to.;5
Each time in premier inn for the location â¦ the room is clean and nice and the bed is amazing â¦the friendly staffâ¦ the restaurant is good and we eat later â¦ thank you kristine and miriam ( restaurant) for your smile âºï¸âºï¸âºï¸ð¡ð¬ð§ thank you premier inn;5
great location , easy check in & good service. Hotel is very accessible to all new york attractions , wyndham membership makes it easy to book & use points to book stay very quickly. Historical hotel near metro & bus terminals for other cities.;5
Out corner Universal view King room was exceptional - drawing back the curtains on arrival to reveal the most amazing view of the park was awesome! We could see all the different attractions and watched Waterworld from up there as we were unpacking!  The room was spacious, very clean and the bed super comfortable.  The bathroom was huge and really well designed with a lovely vanity area.  It only takes 10 minutes to walk into Universal, so great for an early start. There is also a shuttle bus that runs if you want to save your feet.  The staff were all really helpful and friendly - and we were able to leave our bags safely with the concierge both before checking in and after checking out, allowing us to really make the most of our short stay in LA.  The hotel is also perfectly;5
This is a great hotel for the price. Its location is ideal. I was upgraded as soon as I arrived and the room was ready at mid-morning! The staff are cheerful and friendly, and the beds are very comfortable. Ed's Chowder House is an excellent restaurant, and there are many others in the immediate vicinity. Overall, a very good option for visitors to Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or the Museum of Modern Art.;5
Soundproof windows and walls made it unbelievably quiet for a hotel located that close to LAX.  Complimentary shuttle was easy and convenient with pick ups and drop offs every 15 minutes.  The pool was heated and open until 10pm so our family could easily stretch our legs and play after a long 15hr international flight.  There is a 24/7 cafÃ© in the lobby with a large variety of choices including a children's menu.  The staff from check in to check out were all extremely helpful.  We stayed 1 night only as we just needed a comfortable place to sleep after our international flight, and then connected to our domestic flight home early the next morning.  I would use this hotel again.;5
I just made a reservation, about an hour ago, for the second time this year, at the Empire Hotel! Maria Garcia has been assisting me with each of my reservations and has been so incredibly kind and welcoming. She has addressed any concerns that I have had and has made every attempt to make me feel comfortable. I truly appreciate her wonderful customer service and will be gladly staying at the hotel every time I visit NYC.;5
I came to NYC for 4 days to see my girlfriend, so I wasn't going to be spending much time in my room.  I've always been opposed to the idea of spending a trip in a big expensive hotel room watching TV, so I looked around and found the Jane.  Rather than other dorm-style hostels, I wanted a private room with a BED TO SLEEP IN DURING THE NIGHT AND THAT WAS IT.  And that is exactly what the charming Jane Hotel provided.  My room was small (only 50 square feet) but was by NO MEANS CRAMPED FOR ONE PERSON...cozy would best describe it.  I would call it a hotel bedroom rather than a hotel room.  The room was VERY CLEAN and surprisingly well furnished, however.  Complete with AC, fan, telephone, flatscreen TV with cable, clean linens/towels, drawers, and a safe, I was very surprised;5
I stayed only one night over there because I was afraid about the shared restroom..I can tell shame on me cause cause I didn't stay all the nights.  It was great, very clean, excelent location ( close to lots of bars and night life), close to subways, very friendly crew.. A+++ hotel for the price we pay. Recomend to anyone!;5
Staff at the Hilton is great!  They are very focused on the guests and seemed to go out of their way to help.  Ask for local restaurants to avoid the crazy CityWalk. You can skip the shuttle to the park and walk 4.5 minutes.;5
The Empire Hotel is an overall wonderful experience. The hotel is in a great location to experience the city. The staff was polite and helpful. The room is small but all you need when you just need a place to sleep and rest. The cost is a great deal for everything you receive and the location.;5
We spent 4 fabulous nights at this beautiful old hotel in a great location to explore the city.  True, as some people have said, the rooms are quite cosy but they are perfectly acceptable when you don't really need to spend much time in them.  There is great storage and a lovely bathroom with old but clean and beautifully preserved fittings and an unlimited supply of hot water and a really powerful shower.  The room was clean and housekeeping looked after us so well, keeping the room looking pristine while we were out and about.  Free wifi even up on the 37th floor was a godsend and good security by the elevators meant we always felt safe while we stayed there.  Kristal, on reception, welcomed us and was very kind and friendly.  I tried to ask the Concierge for help once but;5
Great hotel. Excellent location. Staff really friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. Doormen are excellent. Can't do enough for you! Will definitely be back! ð½ðððð¤;5
We have just returned from 5 nights and had a wonderful stay. Firstly when we checked in , our room was apalling - tiny, tiny window, view of a wall, wallpaper hanging off the wall and the safe didn't work !  As we'd booked it 9 months in advance and was for special birthdays coming up , we were so disappointed.  We complained at reception and were kindly upgraded free of charge to a fabulous room with a view of empire state building and Madison square gardens. So it's worth complaining !! Lol Other than that the hotel is great, in a great location , 5 mins walk to Macy's , further 5 min walk to Empire State building and 10 min walk in other direction to Times Square.  Madison Square Gardens right outside so great for a Knicks game.  Tick Tock diner was nice but quite expensive;5
We stayed at the Hilton Universal City for 2 nights while we visited the Los Angeles area. The hotel is very close to Universal Studios theme park which is why we chose this hotel. Parking on site was convenient, the front desk was helpful and the rooms were comfortable and recently updated.   We loved the free shuttle that took us to Universal Studios, and found the hotel very easy to locate and access.   The rooms were bright, clean and comfortable. The beds were perfect and we appreciated the modern decor.   We dined at on site restaurant and found the food to be very good and there was a large selection to order from the menu or the buffet. Food was fresh and the wait staff were helpful and friendly.  We would definitely stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend it;5
amazing city view with liberty statue. affordable price at a core location. Very next to Penn station, probably the closest one. Absolutely a 3 star and above hotel.  the services are very professional and friendly.;5
The hotel was very welcoming and check in was quick and easy. Beware of the damage deposit (cash Â£200 or card Â£150!). Room nice and clean, bathroom cold but showers amazing. Bed comfy and rooms cleaned daily. Breakfast is amazing in the attached restaurant, we went every morning. I would budget Â£25 each. Check out is late which meant we could take our time in the morning. Charged to hold bags though which we were not expecting. We have booked again for Dec 24 so I would recommend;5
The decor of the hotel is quite stylish with a latter-day design. Not to mention, the hotel staff provides a delightful ambience that compliments the imagery of the hotel. Without a doubt, we look forward to staying here again-thanks to Kathy, and the rest of the staff.   Great Stay!;5
Our stay at the Hyatt Regency - LAX was great.  The staff was polite, pleasant and professional. The room was clean and well stocked. We asked for a quiet room and it really was, despite it being during the busy holiday period. Valet parking is about $45 a day with in/out privileges, but you can also self-park in the Quik Park garage right behind the Hyatt with easy access to the hotel through the doors where the shuttle vans drop off - it was $15 a day when we were there.  The hotel is right across from the airport with easy proximity to freeways. We would certainly stay again!;5
Yes, rooms are small. Although it still works somehow, we stayed in two beds room and even though it`s literally tiny - it didn`t bother us. Location though - we looved it. One evening we just walked along Hudson to a 9/11 memorial and back, it`s just lovely. It`s 3 mins close to High Line - it`s a beautiful walk. Place has tons of good places to eat around it.;5
In my opinion best hotel in New York City. Iconic and central and staff so friendly and professional, from Lovely Linda at front desk to cleaning staff everything was fabulous   Will definitely return next time Iâm in city;5
"Tough business week in LA and just needed a hotel close to LAX with an airport shuttle.  Walking in this place was calming.  Total redone since I was last here years ago, and the service was the best.  My room ""wasn't available"".  Ok, typical of my week.  ""So I've got an upgrade for you....""  YES!    Seriously kind service here.  Well trained staff.  No...more like well hired people.  People who know how to do it and enjoy the work.  (Jayme checked me and she was excellent.  Like the top notch service you get in asian hotels.)     Even a ""down graded"" room would be pretty good here.  Seriously quiet rooms for an airport hotel.  Definitely my new favorite airport hotel.";5
Stayed here for a week in September. The hotel is very central, close to the Empire State Building and a short walk from Time Square. The room was small, however it's what you would expect in a city and we spent most of our time out sightseeing, so  it was perfectly adequate for our stay. Overall, I couldn't fault anything about this hotel, the service or location. Would recommend and would stay here again.;5
With the room renovations taking place it makes this hotel the only place I want to stay. It is convenient to so many things to do and see in the city. The staff are helpful and friendly. The two adjoining restaurants serve gods food with excellent service;5
Spend here a week, we had no issues, rooms were clean staff nice and welcoming I would definitely come back here. Usually i hate sleeping in hotels as the bed or pillows are not comfortable, but here i had no back or neck pain so im happy :);5
Great location close to Times square and all the happenings in NY. Friendly staff. We got small room, but comfortable. Small shower room, congested. Clean rooms, Good WiFi, would recommend to family and friends.;5
We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City. It is conveniently located near Universal Studios--about a 10 minute walk. The staff was courteous and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. Only thing is we wished we could have been on a higher floor so we could have had a better view but it was our choice as we wanted to check into our room early. We wish we could have stayed longer to try out their lobster buffet as it looked fabulous!;5
possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed in. the staff are really helpful upon arrival and throughout the stay offering to print us maps or directions to get to places and also offering advice on best places to buy things such as a suitcase as ours was broken from the airline! we paid a bit extra and had the junior suite, we booked it with expedia and when you book for more than 5 nights they give you 50% off the full stay! we were able to pay extra $80 dollars to stay in the hotel until 2pm on our last day, you were able to stay later than this but there was more of a charge. there was a jacuzzi in our room which was bigger than it looks in the photos and lovely to have in the morning/evening! The room was huge the only problem we seemed to have was with the fridge, the top;5
Been visiting The Empire for a few years now and it always delivers the goods. Really comfortable beds, great location, and top-notch staff - especially in the Lobby Bar. The rooftop has a great bar, small pool, lounge, meals, and a view;5
Couldnt be better, exceptional staff.Rooms were so clean and super comfy beds ,a fantastic cup of tea in the morning and free wi-fi for my son in lobby. Loved the location , very central for everything we wanted to do.Will always stay there in NY ! Thank you;5
This was a small vacation away from Arizona and my stay was very comfortable. The front desk staff really was super kind especially Nancy and Michael as well as Cynthia and Elias. It was a good price, great stay and good location. I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends and family.;5
Visited the hotel between 7/4 - 12/4. Had problems with our transfer from JFK as had 2 cars booked by Expedia, neither knew where they were going but 1 family got there in just over an hour, we took over 2 hours due to being taken to 2 places in Brooklyn before eventually ending up at the correct Manhattan address! Lady on reception desk was amazing, giving updates to the worried family in the hotel & ringing Carmel Limos to complain on our behalf, big thanks to Carlynh (sorry for spelling). We had 3 rooms booked, 2 on 7th floor for 2 adults in each, with very comfortable double bed. Other room on 8th floor for 3 adults, had 2 double beds, again very comfortable. The showers in all rooms were good & water was hot, yes the rooms are dated but were clean & all we spent in them was;5
When we first met, my partner told me The Jane the topped her wishlist of accommodations in NYC. I decided to grant her wish and booked the the Jane for an extended weekender. Where do I begin? It is one of the most charming places I've been to in all my travels and it easily can be considered one of my top 3.  Keeping consistent with her wish I reserved the double bunk cabin. Prior to my arrival, The Jane staff were professional, knowledgeable and kind. I shared my hesitation as it appeared the room would be small, I was given information on how to pack and what to expect. I was even told that if the Captain Quarters were available at the time of our stay and wanted to switch I could. They were assuring and informative, everything you need to make a decision when you could be;5
Had an amazing Christmas in New York and couldnât of picked a better hotel to stay in!! Right next to the tube, or you can stroll through Central Park... Lovley service and the rooms were 10/10! Would definitely recommend.;5
I stayed with my husband and son, we only stayed one night at this hotel, I could have stayed here for much longer very happily. The room was lovely and spacious with a balcony, very clean and tidy with nice decor....I have not one complaint about our stay at all!;5
Visiting Hollywood for DMB concert and stayed at HW hotel beautiful room and place to hang. Amazing service from Pil, this will be the only place I stay when I come to Hollywood from now on. Thank you!!;5
I stayed 5 nights with my 12 year old daughter. During check-in Muhammad was very nice and helpful! He went out of his way for us (we had a rough previous 12 hours of travel).  The hotel is almost 100 years old, but it is very clean. Heat, a/c, hot water all worked perfect. It looks like the bathroom fixtures might be original. They well kept, but definitely the old style. Beds are comfortable. Had an awesome view, could see Empire State Building from my bed. We had two double with metro view room. It is connected to the Tick Tock Dinner which is convenient and delicious. There are two other restaurants, but we didn't try them. I recommend this hotel. The art deco style was so cool, I loved. Good location. Just a few steps from Penn Station which is convenient. We were easily;5
This hotel is a wonderful option right in Lincoln Center. It is near many fine restaurants, Juilliard, Metropolitan Opera, and Columbus Circle. Staff are very friendly and helpful. I needed an extra late checkout and then an extra night's reservation due to a mixup in my departure, and they were very helpful with all my arrangements. I will stay here every time I'm in Lincoln Center.;5
After reading mixed reviews, I was unsure what to expect, however, the Hotel really delivered.  Our room was more than spacious, 4 travelers with 2 double beds, and 2 bathrooms in the room.  The room was spotlessly clean, and was cleaned daily to a high standard.  Location wise the hotel is perfect, close to all local attractions.  All staff were well turned out, and more than polite.  The ticktock diner is overpriced, breakfast for 4 would set us back $70-80.  The food is ok, just diner standard, there are better about.  Trattoria Bianca is a different story, excellent food, with great staff.  A great place for a few drinks or an evening meal.  I had the best steak I've ever had there.  The cowboy rib.  please try it!  I couldn't have asked for much more from the hotel, and;5
Chose hotel  based on proximity to the venue. Nelson G gave us great suggestions for a quick bite up the street. Also stop by Public House for a drink! Hotel keeps guests safe with MUST use room key to gain access. Safety on area was a plus!;5
Having walked a little way through the narrow streets you see the door of the Riad down a side street, once you step inside you have entered an amazing oasis. It is all beautifully furnished, the rooms are lovely with very comfortable beds but the best thing is the overall service.  We were greeted by Arjane and Elena but all the staff were so attentive without being in your way and nothing was too much trouble for them. The service was above and beyond our expectations and we will return for another visit.  Breakfast was just wonderful and huge (no lunch needed)  and we ate most nights on the terrace, the food never disappointed.  We did a half day guided walk of the medina which was so informative and the guide catered it to the things we wanted to see. We also did a trip to;5
Location was great, room was clean and staff was so friendly and helpful, especially Tiffany and Majid (front desk), Javier (bartender) and Said (Doorman).  They offered free wi-fi as a bonus for the month of May.;5
It is the second time we stay at the Wyndham NewYorker at we had the best holiday ever. Everything worked, from the tours, the food and THE HOTEL. This time we got a room away from the street and we slept like babies. A Perfect week.;5
"Although we were not fortunate enough to experience true LA weather as it was a bit chilly, rainy, and windy; the city is a spectacular journey for everyone. LAX can be tricky to navigate, but as long as you manage expectations and give yourself enough time, it's doable. Hyatt Regency LAX is a great location and the hotel staff are truly service-oriented. It shows in every single interaction with their customers. No question too silly - they have an answer or will find out! They have shuttle service to/from the airport without any wait-time!";5
An absolute gem in the Medina of confusion, a safe sanctuary. Great staff with Siham and Lamia organizing and looking after our every need.  Great rooftop breakfast or wonderful sunset dinner, and incredible service makes this one of the best.  We ate a number of our meals at the riad and had the best tajine there as well. Highly recommend the hammam and massage, it was very relaxing and a great way to end our stay. We had a great time watching the World Cup with the guys, really felt genuinely appreciated. I would highly recommend Riad Kheirredine!;5
This hotel is steps from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. ALL employees were friendly and helpful!!! I requested a high floor and away from the elevator - both accommodations were made with a smile. The room was not available when were arrived (we were a bit early), but front desk called when it became available which was only about a half hour later.  The room was fairly small but very nice and very clean.  We had a beautiful view of the Hudson. The 24 hour diner was a great convenience when leaving MSG late after an event - prices were very reasonable. I also liked that security checked everyone's room keycard before permitting access to the elevators. The only complaint would be the facility charge that was added to the bill which was not expected.  I booked directly thru;5
Hollywood, a fine place to visit. The Hollywood Hotel is a nice place to stay. Just a few blocks from attractions like the walk of fame and Grauman's Chinese Theater and a short drive to Griffith Observatory. The room was spacious and clean and breakage is included. Omelets and waffles made to order and a fine selection of cereal, fruit and pastries.  I would recommend this hotel.;5
Totally recommend this hotel  It was our second stay here and didnât disappoint. The staff were welcoming and helpful  Room very clean  Breakfast very filling  Location brilliant  Will be staying again  Great value for money;5
Absolutely need to try the dinner buffet on Friday and Saturday nights, it is worth the price! Very comfortable bed and bedding that makes you not want to get out of bed. Friendly staff and very helpful when needing assistant with anything. Can walk to Universal Studios from this hotel, just need to cross a bridge and you are there.;5
I was staying in Hollywood for a trip and Pil provided amazing service. He took care of everything I needed during my trip and provided excellent customer service. I will stay here every time I travel into LA and recommend this hotel to everyone I know. Absolutely 5 star service.;5
Fantastic location, between Times Square and Central Park! We had a very friendly welcome by Algenis. The room was superb (we had the kingsize deluxe) with airconditioning, a great bed and a nice shower. A few nights we sat at the bar after returning to the hotel in the evening. The bartender Javier made us some delicious cocktails and was very friendly. He even gave us some advise on where to go during our stay. We had a fantastic stay at the hotel Ameritania.;5
"Chose this location traveling as a solo mom with a newly adult daughter, neither of us having been to NYC before. Very easy to walk from Penn Station after train in from DC, easy access to subway system and walkable areas (like Empire State Building-5 min, Central Park-25 min, FOOD!!!!). After a flight cancelation, we chose to rebook a 2nd night simply because of it feeling safe/comfortable. We did have a very different experience in our 2nd room-much louder street traffic and a squealing from the plumbing (maybe this is very common in NYC?); but to be fair, we had just spent 10 hours at the airport only to be told our flight was cancelled so I may not have been very patient with small inconveniences at this point. Ask for an upper floor if available.";5
We have stayed at the Empire at least 25-30 times over the past 10 years, and we have never been disappointed.  The location is obviously great, just across from the Lincoln Center.  But there is much more to it.  We are especially pleased with the service from all the categories of staff: always friendly and helpful.  The beds are nice and the rooms are clean.  They have a nice restaurant in-house.  We often go for a smaller room, as we do not spend much of our daytime hours there, but there are great, larger rooms in a higher category.  We will be back!;5
Beside a great location, great hotel decor and very fine facilities the hotel staff is remarkably welcoming and helpful. The reception (Janet) provided outstanding service, and the doormen (Jeff) did a great job.;5
Cannot beat location if you are arriving at Penn Station- steps away.  The baggage check is quick and easy and inexpensive.  The hotel aesthetic and service is classic, my favorite.  Stay there every time we are in NYC...ask for the Tesla room!;5
I stayed here for a couple of days with some of my friends. I liked the fact that it is so close to the airport but even with its good location, they still offer a free shuttle service to the airport. It is also close to the beach area. Itâs about 20 minutes away from Redondo Beach which is good considering the LA traffic. The lobby interiors are modern and very pleasing to look at.(Good for taking pictures, too.) Checking in was seamless. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was clean and was very minimalistic. Front desk and the staff were very helpful. I had a couple of requests and all were attended to in no time. Parking was $30/night with in and out privileges which I thought was reasonable. Overall, it was a pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting;5
For me its all about the people, and the staff at the Wyndham New Yorker are the best!  We are a group of 5 over to celebrate a birthday and not only were we upgraded to a fantastic suite with terrific views, we arrived in our suite to a lovely display of towels made up into a double layer birthday cake with a Happy Birthday banner and a bottle of gin & a few bottles of tonic (the birthday girls preferred drink).  We were also waived all extra fees for wifi and facilities and given a late checkout FOC!  That was just the beginning!  What a staff...you should all be proud of yourselves nothing was too much trouble and we loved every minute of our stay with you.  As for the hotel...location is fantastic, beds are big and comfy, rooms are spacious and shower is powerful.;5
We had adjoining rooms with our kids. Great views and spacious rooms. The lifts are slow but staff manned them and looked after everyone.  Front desk service couldn't be faulted and location was perfect. Highly recommended;5
Man I use to work for JDV out of SF under Chip Conley, this hilton has service down! Its a dying skill but customer service here shines. DANNY from egineering rocks. Also the prime rib and lobster buffet is the real deal, yummy;5
Best location on the airport....you can actually walk to terminals....in 10 minutes!  Totally quiet rooms.  I don't know how they soundproof rooms so well, but there are big jets taking off and landing continuously, and you never hear a thing;5
I've been in this wonderful hotel two years ago. I went from Sicily to NYC for studying at the Columbia University.  The hotel is near the Central Park and you can enjoy a quite stay among the nature and a fairytale landscape! I found a family friendly atmosphere there, in particular thanks to Ham. He's a fantastic and kind man who speaks so many languages, creating a special connection with people from all over the world! He makes you feel home... If you go to New York, you should try Astor on the Park. You'll agree with me for sure!!!;5
We booked directly with this hotel...four nights gives you an automatic offer of private transfers to and from the airport, which was well executed and appreciated. The rooms are beautiful and each is unique, with the bonus of two dining options (courtyard restaurant on the ground floor and a roof top terrace, and three lounge ares looking onto an internal courtyard. There are two pools, one on the roof top, and another within an enclosed courtyard on the ground floor. The Riad provides huge towels and sun hats in both areas.  We liked the free mobile phone to call for escort/ hotel staff guide back to the Riad from the edge of the Medina, and it came loaded with map apps which ws useful. For the nervous, it would allow you to leave your own phone safely back at the Riad.  We;5
When we requested separate sleeping accommodations - there was not a room to meet our needs available. However Mohammed worked with us to gain access to a room with added space so a daybed could be set up - and provided complimentary drinks for us while we waited for the room to be cleared after a late departure.   Working with clients in this way takes a little extra time - and really does leave a positive lasting impression.;5
Excellent service, friendly staff, clean rooms, delicious breakfast, I love this property for a family trips, universal studios just across the street, and beside the highway, plus a nice view from the rooms;5
Went to riad kheirredine to celebrate silver wedding with family best experience for hols , staff could not of been more helpful, from getting picked up from airport to leaving .Rooms are lovely and very clean and comfortable.Fruit left in room everyday for you and also left on all tables for you to eat when ever you want any .Will be going back when we can ,so quiet and peaceful ,but if you need anything the staff will get it for you .Keep up the good work valantina and the rest of the staff .;5
We stayed a night here to visit Universal Studios.  The room was nice and modern.  It was clean, and had a view over the freeway and the nearby hill.  The two queen beds were comfortable.  I think the best part of the room was the bathroom.  It was much larger then other chain hotels I have stayed at.  The hotel is about a five minute walk to Universal.  The only downside is the pay parking ($18/ 24 hours).  While we only visited Universal, this hotel would be a good base to explore the surrounding area and downtown LA.;5
We were travelling to NYC to see Billy Joel at MSG. We were extremely impressed with the New Yorker Hotel. The staff was phenomenal. The rooms are small, but very cosy. The beds were very comfortable. The Tick Tock Diner has a wide variety of menu options at a very fair price. We drove into NYC, and took advantage of the valet services - very convenient. The property is adjacent to subway lines A, C, and E (we purchased a MetroCard and made full use of the subway to get around town). These subway lines take you to all points in Manhattan, including the World Teade Center, Times Square, the theater district, Rockefeller, and much more. I hope to stay at this property again for my next NYC adventure.;5
Although I had been in this hotel years ago and it was old and funky, the location couldn't have been nicer. When I went back for four nights - it was super modern and super cool. Great staff, right down to the people handling the front doors - and still wonderful location. It is now my hotel of first choice for the Big Apple (subway connections, ease of taxi, airy, top part of town and great for after work walks in any direction!);5
The Empire is at a perfect location. It is easy to get a cab. The doormen are extremely helpful as are all staff. There is an excellent dining room and lobby bar. Being away from the hectic activity of Times Square and the ease of getting a taxi or driver makes the Empire feel like home in NYC.;5
This is a  great location,  and a great price.  We were welcomed by a  friendly and accommodating staff. All our needs were met.  Overall Very Satisfied.  Only  complaint was the outside noise at night was very well heard in the room.;5
5th time staying at the New Yorker, my go to hotel when staying in NYC. Have not been back since 2014 & was pleased to see a significant number of upgrades since then.   Hotel is in a great location near the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden & 10 minute walk from Time Square. Numerous subway stations close by. We had a great suite on the 39th floor with a great view down 34th Street towards the ESB. Room clean & spacious. TV in both living room & bedroom.   Hungry? Tick Tock Diner attached to hotel. Go there for a hearty breakfast of pancakes, sausage & bacon (always a treat!).   Weâll be back to NYC & The New Yorker!;5
It's a great place in a great location. Really close to the Madison Square Garden. It's really clean and the service is good. Rooms are big and comfortable. A good place to go with the family or for business trip. Friendly people around. Positive!;5
I stayed at Riad Kheirredine for 5 nights in February 2016, from the moment we arrived until the moment we left I felt like I was staying at home. Breakfast on the rooftop terrace was incediable, the whole place smelled of amber and musk that i actually was escorted to the place they buy the oil from and got myself a little piece of Kheirrdeine to take back home with me. The staff (Ahmed) in particular was so warm and welcome he offered me tea every time he saw me. They have the cuttest pregnant cat (Mimi), who we enjoyed to gave around the riad.;5
The location was great for my stay with my family during our Thanksgiving visit as we wanted to see several places in the city and other places we had stayed in the past were not as convenient.  I wasn't sure what to expect based on some of the negative reviews by supposedly travel agents and others.  I had three rooms and all the rooms were great.  All of the staff we met were friendly and helpful.  I am not sure where the negative reviews are coming from but we had a great experience at the hotel.  I will stay again when I am in NYC. It was a great experience, great location, and would do it again.;5
Large rooms, beautifully renovated.  Great location with fun amenities.  Terrific front desk staff and valet/door folks....everyone was so helpful and accommodating!  It was a special occasion trip for our family, and we appreciated the attentive service.  Don't miss the rooftop bar!;5
Everything was absolutely perfect, the staff was incredibly accommodating, and especially Driss at reception was so so nice to my parents, who felt like royalties because of the service received!  Room was fantastic (again, thanks Driss!) and every single of our needs was met. Location is great cause itâs 2 minutes away from the subway and from Penn Station, loads of restaurants around. Wonderful stay, highly recommended.;5
This is GREAT hotel! Definitely one of the cheapest we could find in Manhatten and it's a brilliant find. The staff are super friendly (And their uniforms are amazing!) and there are quirky little details throughout the hotel.  We stayed in the bunk bed room and whilst it is TINY it really doesn't matter, you won't be spending a lot of time in your room whilst in NYC! Both bunks have their own Tvs and reading lights. The Jane also have free wifi which is great.  The cafe at the front of the hotel is also really great with good service, but there are also fab places to eat and drink at around the West Village/Chelsea/Bleeker Street.  The hotel is about a 5/10 min walk from the 14th Street/8th Ave Subway station and perfect for exploring NYC. The aircon in the rooms isn't amazing;5
Before arriving at the hotel i had lots of questions regarding  needs of my mum who is physically disabled and i got a fast responce from jeff, no question i asked was unanswered no matter how silly the question was. When we arrived at the hotel we was greeted by Devon and given our room key. At first view of the room was lovely big and clean and the wheelchair was fully assesable. Beds was very comfy and air con in the room was very good.   Breakfasts was very nice, many thanks to Hugo who made my mum a omelette everyday. Knowing she was disabled he brought her omelette he made to the table which was lovely of him, he really made the effort.  After looking at trip advisor for months before our stay I was worried about what we had booked but after being there myself I cannot;5
The hotel was very classy, and the staff was extremely friendly. Great hotel and very, very close to the Lincoln Center. The only thing I'd say is the room was a bit too dark, but during the day, the room gets great light!;5
Just across the street from Penn station and Madison Sauare garden. Great staff and clean rooms. We were lucky to have a newly renovated room on the 30th floor. 10-15 min walk to Times Square too. Great to have a 24 hour diner at the bottom of the hotel, serving traditional American food.  Retro hotel with interesting history, would definitely stay her again. Thank you The New Yorker, we canât wait to come back!;5
"The location is great, you are in the  middle of everything. The staff was very professional and friendly. Mohammad at the registration counter was super. The internet was the only problem, but we were not there for the internet.  We were very satisfied and if in the area ""The New Yorker"" will be our future choice.";5
My girlfriend and I stayed overnight at this hotel for a show we were attending and it was one of the better hotels we have ever stayed at. The room was clean and a nice size for a NYC hotel. Check out is at 12pm which is great for us. We were able to have our bags held before check in and after checking out which was very helpful! The location is great, right by broadway! Would definitely stay here again;5
We visited this hotel Nov 2012  The Empire has a lovely ambience and is in a great location.  Highly recommend the breakfasts at Ed's Chowder House. Found the staff at the hotel to be very helpful and friendly.  The rooms were clean and tidy and the beds were so comfortable which is whats needed after a day of rushing around the city.  The rooftop bar offers fabulous views of the city and is a great place to enjoy a drink in the evening.;5
The Riad Kheirredine truly pampers guests with exemplary service, plush beds, sumptuous Egyptian cotton sheets, cashmere blankets, and delicious breakfasts complete with French and Moroccan fare. From the moment Marco met me at Sidi Ben Slimane to walk me to the Riad, I enjoyed my visit immensely.    On my first evening, I was invited to have dinner at a local restaurant called Dar Zellig, which features traditional Moroccan food, wonderful service, and a romantic and beautiful setting, complete with a guitarist who plays music while guests dine.  After being walked to the restaurant by a Riad employee, I enjoyed a lovely glass of Moroccan wine on the rooftop terrace as mesmerizingly beautiful calls to prayer rang out in the scented evening air from mosques all around the;5
Smooth check in, clean hotel and location was the best we have stayed in by far. Reasonably priced for location and easy access to train, bus and tube just a few minutes walk away. Couldnât fault it at all, we went to a show and Jack the Ripper tour and both were just a short bus ride away. Would stay here again for sure. Staff were helpful providing towels, pillows and refreshment top ups, nothing was too much trouble.;5
My birthday weekend at Empire hotel was nothing short of perfect. From the moment we walked in, until we checked out! First, we were greeted by the manager on duty, Nicole Agnello, she was welcoming and made us feel right at home. When she found out it was my birthday she showed us to our room and ensured we had everything we needed. She showed us around the room, showed us all the amenities and even offered suggestions for dining close to the hotel.  Everything from the bed to the shower was luxurious! I enjoyed every minute I spent here, the staff was exceptional, the cleanliness of the hotel was pristine, the overall experience was amazing! And a big special thank you to Nicole, who made us feel welcome from the second we walked in! We will definitely be back!;5
I really enjoyed working with the staff everybody was friendly and in my Room had no shampoo and conditioner they were right on it they offered me a free breakfast for that I was with 2 friends and they even offered them breakfast is well which is way above and beyond the Call of Duty;5
Just a short walk from Waterloo underground, the Premier Inn County Hall is an ideal base for visiting numerous sites, theatres, etc. within a half hour walk across the Waterloo footbridge and along the South Bank. The hotel is spacious and the welcome friendly.  The restaurant was well priced for central London and the beds were, of course, very comfortable so we slept well.;5
The rooms are great, very comfortable and clean and nice layout.  But best part is the hotel is a short walk from most of the terminals at LAX so rather than take the 30 minute shuttle around, you can walk to this hotel in about 3-4 minutes.  Or rather wait in the ridiculous Uber/Lyft lines now, you can catch one from the hotel in a few minutes as well.   The hotel is very clean and great layout with nice bar and good restaurant Unity.  Nice fitness center and pool.  Highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying overnight near the airport.  Its the best. And rates are usually very good as well compared to neighboring properties.;5
BEST location to stay if visiting Universal Studios!!! They provide shuttle to the park and itâs only a few minutes walk if you prefer.  The staff is awesome and you will definitely enjoy your stay ð They also gave us an awesome view of the park from the 18th Floor!;5
from the people to the room to the food and location was excellent. I would recommend to anyone visiting the big apple.;5
The highlight of our stay at the Ameritania Hotel was Said, the best doorman ever.  He was always friendly when we left for the day and if we returned before his shift was over we received the same gracious consideration.;5
I will add to the fantastic reviews of this Riad. Elena, Lamia, Asma, and all the guides/helpers/chaperones were so thoughtful and helpful. The property itself is upkept very well, and lots of places to enjoy the grounds- from two pools to small beach chairs to chaise lounges... I absolutely loved the bowls of fruit placed throughout the property. My teenagers and I certainly enjoyed quite a bit of fresh Moroccan fruit. We took the advice of several reviews to enjoy their Moroccan dinner in the Riad our first evening. My older son wasnât feeling well so stayed in our room but my younger son and I enjoyed a multi course Moroccan meal- better than any of the other ones we had during our stay.  Another highlight for me was the phone to call the staff wherever we were to guide us;5
Riad Kheirredine had been highly recommended through friends of friends who had previously stayed here. Their stories of their stay seemed a bit far fetched......nothing could really be that good !!!!!  IT WAS......... ROOMS - comfortable and very clean FOOD - delicious, breakfast on the terrace/in your room/in the restaurant. Dinner in the restaurant with an excellent choice of dishes.  STAFF - couldnât do enough for you - booking taxis and organising excursions.  FACILITIES - excellent .... map & mobile phone to contact the receptionist for assistance if required ( so easy to get lost in the MÃ©dina trying to get back to the Riad ), 2x plunge pools to cool off, internet access, fresh fruit and bottled water available, and a free laundry ( handy if you are on a two centre type;5
This is THE best place we've ever stayed and to put it in perspective, Morocco was the 53rd country I've visited.  Let me begin with the owner, Marina. I instantly felt like she was welcoming us into her beautiful home when we arrived.  She made us feel like family.  We were welcomed with a delicious breakfast to start.  Following that, we sat outside in the courtyard by the pool and fountain as beautiful Valentina told us all about the Riad.  There was no doubt in our minds that she would make our visit perfect.   She showed us to our room on the top floor where fresh fruit and pastries were waiting.  It was spacious, beautifully decorated, and very cozy with a fireplace.  The light smell of incense and fresh flowers filled the air.  The bathroom had handmade soap, shower gel;5
this hotel is in a great location as its within easy walking distance of central park, times square, fifth avenue and many more of the famous attractions in Manhattan. the rooms were spacious and immaculately cleaned every day. the staff were excellent. they were all very helpful, especially Jeff who was fantastic with advice on using the subway organising taxis and generally the best way to get around the city. he also has great advice on places to eat and visit. we stayed at the hotel as a family of four our kids being ten and eight and the hotel was perfect for us. we will definitely be staying here again when we return to New York next year. highly recommended.;5
As our first taste of Morocco, this Riad was the perfect choice. Valentina, Yajaira, and the entire staff were the warmest, most helpful people possible. Nothing was too much for them - each and every person working in the Riad went out of their way to make sure you had the best time possible. In addition to the cell phone, recommendations, and guided walks through the medina mentioned already, I must thank them for helping me try to track down a missing suitcase, which entailed multiple calls a day and endless patience!  The food was delicious, and the limitless cups of lemon water and plates of watermelon never ceased to refresh.  We were traveling with our daughters, ages 7 and 11, and stayed in the Eucalyptus Room and the nearby Musk Room (picture not online). I would highly;5
Our stay at the New Yorker was great. The hotel is very conveniently located near Penn Station which was great for us as we came in on the train. It is well situated in midtown near easy access to everything you want to see in New York City. My only complaint is that it was pretty crummy and dirty just outside the hotel on the sidewalk, but that's a New York problem not a New Yorker problem.;5
From the moment we walked in Nicole was very happy to help us with the check in. She provided instructions to the metro and recommendations for restaurants around the area. Nicole is very helpful and super friendly with us during our stay.;5
I love this hotel for what it is and the price. Rooms with shared bathroom are indeed small, but they are super comfortable and have all you need. Bathrooms are squeaky clean and have a good size. It's your best option for a fair priced downtown hotel.;5
Linda made our stay a special one. She is very attentive and went above and beyond expectations. Rooms were nice you can tell it has been renovated recently, as well as parts of the hotel. We come to this location every year not only because of the location (which is walking distance to Universal) but the friendly staff.;5
We stayed here just two nights (our first time in Los Angeles) coming to town for a family event. The room was very comfortable and spacious, and the shower was amazing. We didn't swim but the pool area was lovely and comfortable just for sitting and soaking up the beautiful weather. What stood out to us most was the staff. Every time we asked someone for assistance, they were extremely accommodating. When I had trouble logging into the computers in the lobby to print our boarding passes, one of the staff members let me use his computer. We would recommend this hotel highly.;5
Staff all really helpful and friendly. Restaurant lovely. Room (27th floor) was large, clean and quiet. Ask for a fridge to store water/milk (buy in 7/11 around the corner), we were quoted â¬20 for duration (really good value I thought) but no charge on checkout! Great spot in midtown Manhattan as a base.  Stones throw from Empire State, Madison Sq Gardens & Macyâs and very walkable distance to key attractions (Central Park, natural history museum, broadway, Times Square, Madame Tussaudâs, Bryant Park, intrepid museum, grand central terminal, top of the rock) with the exception of downtown (9/11,statue of liberty, Ellis island, Brooklyn bridge, financial district) But suggest you take 20 min walk and get a  water taxi thead there for a day out, great fun and very reasonable.;5
We stayed in the New Yorker for 5 nights in February. After reading some reviews we were not sure what to expect.   We were not disappointed.  From a speedy early check in (arrived an hour early) to having our room upgraded on arrival we were off to a great start. We were on 35th floor with a superb view of the Empire State and Madison square garden.  We had a double double room and yes it was compact with small bathroom but was clean and comfy and very manageable.   (Slept fantastic all nights we were there ).  Situated beside tic toc diner which is fantastic for breakfast and hotel is only  5 min from maceys and penn station.  Hotel staff all very friendly and it was nice to have security check everyone before they headed for lifts.   Felt very safe.  It was nice to sit in the;5
GREAT! My chicken was fast and efficient. The check in staff and concierge were outstanding, great service.  My room is a little small, but Iâm 6â4â so most rooms are small.  The bed was very comfortable. I have a slight problem with my television which was quickly repaired.;5
Loved staying at the New Yorker, and loved the amazing view!  Would stay there again, in a heartbeat. The view in the 35th floor facing, The Empire State Building was incredible.  Having many train stations located close by, made my arrival, my stay and my departure very accessible.;5
I booked our stay for its convenience in location and its fairly reasonable price and it didnât disappoint! It started with a great experience with the front personnel, specifically Mohammed, who accommodated our needs at check-in. For an 80-yr old hotel, it was updated as best it could to stick with an âart decoâ theme. And how cool was it to be on the same floor as the Nicola Tesla room and study?! We found out about it after the fact! Would def book here again!;5
Beautiful hotel, amazing staff, easy to walk or shuttle to Universal Studios or City Walk. My son and I had a great time. The coffee shop was fantastic and employees were so polite. If I needed anything at all, I only had to ask. The self parking garage is easy to maneuver and made even easier with a gate pass to use during the stay. Thank you so much!;5
Just coming to the end of our stay and go home tomorrow. So sad to leave. Excellent check in by helpful staff. Nice clean room overlooking the Hudson. Special mention to Catherine on security. Very interesting to talk to and gave us helpful hints for eating out etc. Loved the atmosphere in this traditional and historical hotel. Fantastic location and not one rude person in sight. We will hopefully be back as we have caught the NYC bug and the Wyndham exceeded our expectations!;5
Excellent hotel - with exquisite views, very clean, very well located in the center of NY - near top points of interest&means of transportation, great and helpful service, customer oriented management! Definitely we will come back in our next trips!;5
This amazing hotel is just 10 mins from the airport and you can get complimemtary bus shuttle service which is every 10 mins interval. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. You can get everything you need for a 1 or 2 nights stay here. Fantastic!;5
We loved the roof top.  There are many areas to sit in the sun or in the shade.  There is a very small pool to dunk in.  When we were there it was very hot so much appreciated.  We stayed in a beautiful room off the roof deck.  When we arrived the staff was very accommodating, allowing our children's room to be swapped to a room closer to their friends.  However both of their rooms was very, very small.  I would not want a small room here, ask for a big room.  The service is excellent.  The people are very kind, friendly and in good spirits.  When we arrived we had Moroccan tea.  The staff helped us with dinner reservations and walked us to each restaurant as Marrakech is a difficult city to get around.  We had breakfast each morning on the roof deck, lovely.  We did try both;5
To have dogs and people staying during Westminster, the stay couldn't have been more enjoyable with efficient service. The staff was extremely helpful and addressed everything we asked or needed during our stay. Room was lovely and clean. View was the best.;5
Very nice hotel with friendly helpful staff. Very quiet and relaxing. Super close to the Universal City Walk and Universal Studios. They have a free shuttle that takes you there or it is less than a 10 minute walk. I would recommend this hotel to all and will stay there again.;5
Staying at the New Yorker is a step back in time, to a more elegant period. A short walk away from Penn Station, this large hotel has lovely small rooms that are well-appointed and comfortable. I had a grand view of the Empire State Building from my window. The gym is reasonably good, and the staff are very helpful. But it is NYC - this place bustles with energy and crowds.;5
We arrived here on April 8th we were a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews However it was a  great place to stay quiet away from the hustle of New York Friendly and helpful staff courteous OK a few small problems but nothing to fret over spoke to the front desk and the issue was resolved within the hour Would I recommend it? a most definite yes would I return to this hotel? absolutely I am now looking to return soon and would definitely be booking here.My photos don't do it justice It was clean and tidy every day.;5
Our stay at Riad Kheirredine was absolutely amazing! My wife booked four nights here for our wedding anniversary and we couldnât have been in a better spot. The riad had everything we were looking for with great rooms, great lounging areas, and an overall great vibe. The staff was unbelievably helpful taking care of everything from reservations, giving suggestions, even walking us to and from places to make sure we didnât get lost! Would recommend to anyone coming to Marrakesh! Special shout outs to Elena, Lamia, and Souffiane who made this stay extra special!;5
Just spent 4 nights in the Ameritania Hotel. It was so central to the visitors attractions. Room was spacious enough and the bathroom was well equipped and a great shower, hotel supplied essential liquids. Good WiFi. Jeffery was very helpful and gave us some sound advice on getting around. Reception staff were very nice and there tea and coffee available free all day.;5
From the time I was picked up from the airport to departure, the staff have been super nice. I think everyone is on happy pills. All staff that I had the pleasure to talk to, were engaging and helpful. I am recommending the Hyatt to anyone who will listen. Thanks for a great stay. Christina;5
We arrived on New Years Day , checking in was a doddle , we had a double room with a view of the river. The hotel has kept its original style throughout the hotel , our room was clean and stylish , the beds were comfly and the power shower did the trick. For our short stay we only used the hotel and our room as a base , the rest of the time we were out and about enjoying the sights and sound of NYC. We would like to take this opportunity to wish the New Yorker management and staff a happy new 2020 and good luck for the future. I have reviews you hotel with 5 stars but a suggestion would be to have a kettle in the rooms with free tea and coffee - its only a suggestion.;5
This facility is first rate for families looking to spend a little time at Universal Hollywood. The entire staff is family friendly and they went out of their way to make sure our weekend stay perfect.  The beds are supremely comfortable and the hotel's restaurant and staff are exceptional.  We couldn't have had a better time.;5
My wife and I completed a month stay in Morocco, and we chose well staying with Riad Kheirredine. Sara and I had been communicating for over a year through COVID, and she helped the transition and vacation cancellation in September so we could stay in April.  The riad itself is beautiful and immaculate. There were staff to meet our every need, including room service dinner, fantastic laundry service, and helpful porters and guides. Said was a real standout here, as he would escort us to the souks on foot from the riad.   We also had a room upgrade, thanks to Sara, as there were less guests due to the pandemic. Our suite was lovely, spacious with good shower heads and bathroom facilities. We had a small balcony where we could spend some time on while in the room, although we;5
Great place, close to everything, classic style and comfort. Beautifully appointed rooms, overlooking lincoln center and right next to Central Park. Views from the rooftop bar are amazing!!! Awesome restaurants and shopping just steps away. Friendly staff.;5
"Yes, there are lots of things about the hotel that weren't great; the aircon is a box behind the curtain, the room is small, the dÃ©cor is tired (lots of paint splatted over the floors), our view from the window was the internal courtyard covered in rubbish.  However, was it in a good location? yes.  Was is clean and comfy with a good shower? yes.  Were the staff good? yes. Would I stay there again?, yes I would.  The room could have done with a kettle and a bedside lamp but overall it was good value, and located a block down from the subway giving easy access to the rest of the downtown sites.  We were really pleased with our choice, to be fair we were hardly in our room, all we wanted was comfy, clean and friendly and it ticked those boxes.";5
Great Location, Very nice (although slightly small) rooms, Very nice and helpful staff. From the front desk, housekeepers and doormen. Great experience all around. Also the price was very reasonable for such a nice hotel by New York standards.;5
Once a year we treat ourselves to several consecutive opera performances, and we always stay at the Empire Hotel while we are in the city. We have been doing this for a number of years. The hotel's location can't be beat for our purposes. We look forward to arriving at our comfortable accommodations, where the staff is so pleasant and our every request is honored. Mostly we enjoy the view across to the Lincoln Center Plaza, if we are fortunate to secure a room with that particular vista. At Christmas time, it's very festive. The one drawback is that the bathrooms at the Empire are tiny, with a partial shower enclosure that often allows some water to end up on the floor! But the location of the hotel, for us, makes up for the necessity of using an extra towel to mop up a bit.;5
We stayed here for 10 nights and had a fantastic time! Very helpful staff, the rooms were clean and bright. Breakfast was amazing, waffles and omelette were made as you want them right infront of you, beats any other hotel we stayed at. Close to everything around Hollywood, subway and bus just within walking distance. One do not need a car if you plan to stay in and around Hollywood. When we will go back to L.A we will stay at this hotel for sure.;5
Brian helped us at check in and was a great service to my husband and I. When we got to our room our shower wasn't turning on. We called the front desk and Brian let us know how to properly turn on the shower, and solved our problem very quickly. Also later on in the night we needed some silverware and we were helped immediately. We were celebrating a special birthday and the hotel made our experience more than memorable. Extremely clean, quiet, and friendly staff. More than satisfied with our stay, would love to come back.;5
Our visit was great! Our room was very clean and modern with nice bedding. Brian checked us in and was wonderful, he was helpful and professional.   He gave us assistance with parking information and made sure we had everything we needed.  Food in the morning was a pleasant surprise - yummy hot breakfast!;5
Great location opposite the BEST Cantina. Massive place but higher floors have less rooms, quieter. Great facilities in room (internet/tv/cable). Comfortable beds and a great view of downtown from the 39th floor.;5
We can 100% recommend Riad Kheirredine without reservation.  Riad Kheirredine is located in a quiet residential area within the Median and difficult to find. However, we had transportation arranged by the Riad (recommendation here) and this worked like clock work. Our driver was exactly where we were to meet him at the airport, and staff were on hand at the taxi drop off point to take our cases to the Riad. An effortless transfer.  On venturing out anyone will find it difficult at first to find their way back to the Riad, but donât be put off by this as you will be given a local mobile to phone for assistance, and staff are readily at hand to walk you to your destination, or bring you back home. However, on our second day we got the lie of the land, and to be honest all the;5
Very nice hotel, will allow early check-in and check-out based on availability -- nice pool -- pool bar staff is very good and quick -- drinks and food at pool are excellent  -- this is also a family friendly hotel;5
We landed late Thursday night and went straight to hotel. This Hilton has a feel of a five star hotel. The customer service is not to be believed!  Upon check in they explained how to get to the park, parking at park and ticket choices. They were very helpful.  We had a private tour booked of Universal so we were all set but they were still very helpful.    Room overlooked universal, very pretty at night. The bell hop offered to get us milk for our baby girl.  He even asked if we needed it warmed.    The next morning the hotel was full. Breakfast was fabulous, ate at restaurant in lobby.  We rented a car and held our bags until the car arrived. They loaded us up and we were on our way. The check out was simple.   This hotel is a perfect location for a Universal Studios visit and;5
We stayed at this hotel last week, and had the best experience.  We stayed in an executive alcove room on the 21st floor, and had a gorgeous view of the city.  The service here was impeccable, from front desk staff, housekeeping, and restaurant staff.  Our room was tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean, and very roomy and comfortable.  They have 4 elevators, and all were working perfectly--we never had to wait for an elevator.  We went to the prime rib and seafood buffet on saturday night--$49 per person--and had to wait for a seat!  The buffet was fantastic--lobster thermidor, king crab legs, clams, mussels, salmon, etc....and a HUGE array of desserts.  The daily breakfast buffet is awesome too.   Universal Studios is a short walk over the pedestrian bridge right on the hotel;5
The staff was extremely helpful and the rooms were comfortable. I especially loved the bed and the pillows. Truly an excellent stay, their lounge had excellent amenities and the staff was very attentive.;5
I have stayed at the New Yorker for over 15+ times. I look forward to staying there when I travel to NYC. I always remark that it is good to be home. From the time you enter the lobby to check in until the time you check out the stay ensure that your needs are looked after. It is so refreshing to see all the familiar faces when I arrive. to me that speaks volumes as to how good a place it must be to work. Thanks again to all the staff who made my trip wonderful.;5
This hotel is nothing short of amazing! Staff are all superb, beautiful clean spacious rooms and the attached Tick Tock Diner has great food and amazingly polite attentive staff. Cannot praise this hotel enough for making my daughter's Christmas so special! Views from the room of the Empire State, well I'd never tire of waking up to that view! Thank you all again. Will definitely stay here again.;5
My friend and I took a girlâs trip in June 2021 for a much needed get away. While understanding that Covid had shut down some thingsâ¦the best part of the hotel was under renovations which was their lounge and bar. We were super disappointed that there was no restaurant and no bar. Our room also had problems with the refrigerator not working. We spoke with the night managers Phil and Gustavo Who were beyond sympathetic to our need for a better room. Without asking to be upgraded, they offered to upgrade us to a much better room. It made all the difference. Our trip turned around and we had the best weekend we couldâve imagined. They were the sweetest and most understanding hotel staff that Iâve ever encountered and Iâve traveled quite a bit.;5
I have been staying at Hilton for YEARS, and have not stayed anywhere since COVID started until this stay in March. I have over paid for junkie stays in the past and can write a book on the things encountered, so it was nice to find the right location for the right price!  This location was AMAZING in the cleanliness and the friendliness of staff. The hotel is was super clean and is the perfect location for anyone staying in LA. It is close to Hollywood, Downtown, and is easy to get in and out of. The amenities are not over done and over priced. They have just enough for an enjoyable stay, and great views from the rooms.  The location is pet friendly and has about a dozen EV type 2 chargers. By far our first choice for staying in LA and for when Universal Studios finally;5
Very friendly staff, very comfortable beds, we had a nice view of the pool. Close and handy to Universal Studios, eateries etc. Free wi fi in the lobby. Came all the way from Australia and have no complaints.;5
This property has all the amenities a traveler desires!  The location is extremely convenient for access to the LAX International airport. Marina Del Rey is just a few miles away and offers a large number of services and entertainment venues!;5
Stayed here in early January with my wife to celebrate our 20th anniversary.  We typically stay at large chain hotels but wanted something with more local flair so we chose the Empire.  I am VERY glad we did!  The hotel is close to Lincoln Center, ABC studios and Columbus Circle...and a stone throw from central park.  After a 10 minute cab ride from Penn Station, we arrived and were greeted by very friendly bellmen.  My wife went to the bar to get us something to drink and I went to check in.  Jose' quickly found my reservation and in seconds I had a room key and was on my way.  I asked him to recommend a restaurant where my wife and I could celebrate our 20th anniversary and he gave me several fantastic recommendations.  I met up with my wife in the bar, finished our drinks and;5
"I chose this property because of its proximity to Universal Studios, which we were visiting.  It is right on the property and an easy walk to and from the park, even though a shuttle is available.  I stay nearly exclusively at Hilton Properties and enjoy Diamond status as a result, although my stays are usually at Hampton inns or Hilton Garden Inns.  I am also very critical of small details.  This hotel is outstanding.  The staff is attentive and each request was followed with a prompt and polite ""my pleasure.""  The Starbucks on site also serves gelato and the barista was very kind to our 9 year old, offering her sample tastes of whatever she wanted.  (He was rewarded with a generous tip).  We had room service the first night (delivered within 40 minutes, very hot and";5
I was looking for a simple clean hotel with a good location and this was it! A better price than others and it was right by the subway. Another important factor was the great cafe across the street with tasty, cheap food and friendly employees. This was my second stay here and I plan to come again on my next trip!;5
Love everything Starting with the people in the front desk to the rooms and the hotel decor. I have to say that everything was excellent. Patrick was really nice and polite. Love him and Kathleen. Canât wait to go back. Really close to Central Park... lot of stores to do some shopping for fam and friends if you are that kind of âgalâ. If you thinking on having a romantic getaway or to just spend a couple of nights out of the chaos. This is your place. Really quite and full of sights.;5
We stayed in a Standard Queen Room which was very clean and had all we needed. We didn't have the best of views but we spent little time in the room so it didn't matter.  The Wifi charges are a little steep but the Starbucks located just round the corner has free Wifi . The room had enough space with a generous size bathroom and shower. The rooftop bar was a perfect addition with beautiful views. Great location, within walking distance to Central Park, 5th Avenue and Subways. Overall a great hotel with very helpful staff.;5
We came to California to celebrate my mom's 85th birthday and give her one of her dreams..go to the Price is Right. The room was fabulous. The staff is super friendly and helpful not to mention knowledgeable. I want to especially recognize Hugo the hard working chef and his amazing omelette ability. Mom said she enjoyed her omelette so much she talked about it the entire day. Thank you for making our trip so enjoyable!;5
Staff couldn't have done anything more to make our stay more enjoyable, from arranging our transfer to walking us into the markets on our first day. The terrace was the perfect location to enjoy our first evening meal and our room was beautifully set for our arrival. Staff recommended restaurants throughout our stay and made us feel very welcome.;5
We were greeted so warmly by text, due to the late hour of our arrival at the airport, and again when we arrived by the bell and front desk staff.  Check in was quick and efficient and we arrived to a comforting and well-appointed room.  If I had to find something to comment upon, it would be the tissues in the bathroom - one ply.  A lovely corner room which was very comfortable was our âhomeâ for the 4 nights.  Location is great to see Universal and Warner Brother's studio.  Free Shuttle to Universal and a $15-20 cab ride to Warner Brothers.  Excellent!  Breakfast is amazing and I know why they are famous for their Steak/Seafood Buffet - make a reservation!!  Would highly recommend this property and the team of folks there who will support your visit!  Great brand ambassadors;5
People have to know we are in post Pandemic stage and there is a labor shortage. Companies are trying... Almost every hotels we stayed lately, I have noticed the house keeping service is lacking. Took 2 hours in Hilton at Austin to set up our sofa bed. So we lowered our expectation with Hotels, and then we stayed at the Hilton LA/Universal city.... what a wonderful surprise!!!   We had a long weekend vacation in LA, stayed at 2 hotels. Hilton LA/Universal and Residence Inn LA live. We flew in to Burbank because I hate LAX.  I lost my ID at the Avis counter (long story), and worried about checking in to Hilton without an ID. The staff was so nice and sweet, very professional and after few security questions... we got upgrade to higher floor (Diamond Member) .  Kevin (manager) and;5
This is not a luxury hotel.  However, it is clean, the housekeeping staff is amazing, the beds are super comfortable, everything went smoothly throughout my stay.  Convenient to entertainment, great food, the subway.  I will stay here again.;5
My wife booked this trip to celebrate our 50th birthday. On letting the hotel know this they arranged a complimentary upgrade.  So, first impressions, beautiful Art Deco foyer, loads of staff and no waiting to book in. We were early to book in so our room wasnât ready. Staff couldnât have been more apologetic but assured us it was a really good room so worth the wait. Checked the luggage in, went out for a couple of hours and came back. Turns out the previous occupant had only just booked out so the room still wasnât ready.  Again, staff could not have been anymore helpful. The gentleman on the reception nips away. Speaks to his manager, comes back with a complimentary bottle of champagne and an upgrade to a suite on the 39th floor with a view of the Empire State Building. (Bear;5
THANK YOU for such an amazing visit at your property !!  My daughter is interning in the city this summer, and I came up to celebrate her 20th bday .  From the time I arrived at the property on Sunday at noon, I was welcomed with such a warm and friendly greeting.  My room was not ready, but my bags were stored and in no time , I received a phone call within 2 hours, that I could check in.   I was surprised to be upgraded to a King room vs the Queen I had booked.  Everyone at the hotel was over the top with kindness( front desk, bellman, doorman, and housekeeping )  The concierge assisted me in planning a birthday dinner at the hotel restaurant- Ed's Chowder House, on Memorial Day.  The staff at the restaurant went over the top in celebrating my daughter's bday and made us feel;5
Older hotel priced under $300/night, located right next to Lincoln Center and Metropolitan Opera in mid-town Manhattan.  Nice ambiance -- rooms small but cozy and attractive.   Elegant lobby.  Great bell service.   Will be our go-to place for Manhattan;5
Friendly staff, comfortable rooms, great food. Definitely a lovely hotel in New York City. Location is convenient, close to subway station, Starbucks and supermarket around the corner.  Restaurant in hotel was very good.;5
TheHilton Universal was really a great place to stay.  It was walking distance to Universal Studios and a short trip to Hollywood and Vine.  The personnel in the hotel went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.  The lobby restaurant buffet was among the best I have ever had.  Nothing bad to say about this experience.  I would definitely go back.;5
I spent the weekend at the Empire Hotel.  The location was wonderful, the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were clean and nice.  But my most memorable experience was with reservations.  I accidentally made a non-refundable reservation for the wrong date.  The Empire Hotel was amazing about allowing me to make a new reservation and transferring my credit to that new reservation.  They were not required to do this, especially since I didn't even know I had made the mistake until I received an email from them asking how my checkin experience had been.  This kind of treatment of customers will make me a loyal fan of the Empire Hotel for years to come!;5
This hotel is in a perfect location 54th and 8th, right on the corner of the Colbert report studio. The staff was extremely helpful, Jeff the door attendant, helped us with our bags, he helped us get a car scheduled to drive us from the hotel to the airport the day of our departure. He was very friendly and courteous. Our room was the right size and had all the things we needed. I have very happy with our stay;5
My first stay at the Riad Kheirredine was incredible. I went with two friends for a weekend trip and I couldn't of imagined a better experience. From the moment we walked in the Riad we received 5 star service and felt like the only guests in the Riad. We were greeted by Valentina who felt like a friend rather than the typically artificial hotel staff. We were given Mint tea(the most amazing tea I've ever had in my life) and warm towels. After talking to Valentina and her asking our preferences for breakfast we were showed to our room, the Jasmine room, which was beautiful and immaculate just like every other area in the Riad. There was water and fresh fruit in the room which was replenished every day. My friends and I wanted to get straight out and explore the Medina, and;5
This is a brilliant hotel in a great location it's close to time square, the Empire State Building and Penn Station which is great if you are coming by train just a short walk away.   The hotel is all Art Deco 1920's the lobby is amazing and the design continues up in the bedrooms even thou they are on the smaller size it's a central hotel in the heart of a busy city.;5
I made my room reservation in NY based on square inches of space, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found the room to be comfortable and not claustrophobic. The staff were very courteous and helpful.;5
We stayed in the hotel last week and found it just perfect. Especially when taking into account the rate compared to those of other New York hotels....  The rooms were a bit small but very clean and had good bed. If you cross the street you are in central park and just 2 blocks walking for the metro. Within 10 minutes you can be in downtown Manhattan!  We highly recommend this place to those looking for a clean and comfortable hotel for a very reasonable price. We we certainly come back here! Rodey & Helen, Amsterdam The Netherlands;5
First time staying  here at the Hyatt LAX Airport. The shuttle runs every 15-20mins, From the airport. The front Desk staff was nice and friendly. The lobby area was very chic and modern as well. My room was big! It was clean, towels were fresh, and the robe was a nice touch. Not really close to anything other than the airport. Their is a bistro downstairs close to the lobby as well as a restaurant. I would recommend this hotel.;5
Riad Kheirredine, as nearly all other TA reviewers have mentioned, is spectacular. While the accommodation and location within the Medina are excellent, the service and attention we were given by all of the staff was unparalleled. Both Elena and Sara especially were very helpful and went out of their way to make our stay special.   We were checking out the day before my wife's birthday to go to one of the other resorts outside the Medina, and they surprised her with a birthday cake and the team wishing her happy birthday. Just another example of the excellent touch and service you will no doubt received at Riad Kheirredine!;5
I am very impressed with this hotel's customer service, it exceeded all my expectations.   While rushing through Times Square, my iPhone fell out of my purse. I tried to track it down but failed. I used my daughter's phone to text her number to my lost phone. At this point I lost all hope to ever seeing my beloved phone again. Whilst driving, I received a call on my daughter's phone from the Empire Hotel. The staff who politely greeted me had great news for me. Someone who had stayed at the Empire Hotel had found the phone on the street and turned it to the hotel. He had called to tell me that they had my phone and would hold on to it until I returned to NYC. I was so thrilled that I forgot the gentleman's name! I called the hotel again, but someone else answered the phone, I;5
Had a wonderful time late December at this Riad. With orange trees and palms in the atriums, and original walls dating from the construction of the Medina, and tight staircases leading to the individual rooms, you will feel a part of Marrakech's history.  Everything is custom. Meals are served with a call down to the management. Luggage is brought into and out of the Riad by staff. Our daughter was presented with a chocolate cake and sparklers for her birthday.  It has an alcohol license, useful if you're celebrating anniversaries or birthdays.  Breakfast could be improved with better chef techniques, omelettes were just OK.;5
My stay here was absolutely comfortable! Everything was nice, clean, just overall amazing! The staff is very well mannered but I have to thank and appreciate one there which is Nancy Ramirez (I hope I remembered her name) she helped me with Universal Studios since I have been wanting to go to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and was very informative. Definitely will come back;5
What an amazing location staff were amazing nothing too much trouble! Would definitely stay again the restaurant was clean and staff were so friendly! The hotel is amazing from the outside clean and tidy! We would stay again as location and service was excellent!;5
Very centrally located.  Clean and quiet. I loved how big this room was compared to other hotels in NYC. Right across from Madison square garden. We will definitely be back. It was a great experience overall.;5
Just spent 2 nights at the Hyatt Regency Hotel at LAX. This is our second visit since the major remodel and we couldn't have been happier. Rooms are quiet and comfortable with all the usual Hyatt Regency amenities. Wonderful huge 55 inch flat screen TV in all guest rooms and suites. All of the hotel staff are well-trained and eager to meet customers needs and requests. Front desk staff is efficient, especially during those busy check-in and check-out times that you find at a busy Airport Hotel. Very convenient and exceptionally good 24/7 Open Market for all those early morning or late night snacks. Lots of healthy food options available. Restaurant and cocktail lounge are quite good as well.  Room service breakfast  was delicious and delivered in a timely manner. Definitely;5
This was our first trip to New York and we chose The New Yorker for it's convenient location. What a good choice it was. It is a lovely hotel keeping lots of it's original 1920 features but being modern at the same time. I would personally like to thank Kristale who gave us the most fantastic room when we got to reception. The view from our room was straight down to the Empire State Building. I had heard stories of New York rooms being small, not so ours which was a very pleasant surprise. There is noise from the streets of New York (whose drivers seem to live honking their horns) but we were so tired from our exciting, fun filled days that we were asleep within moments. The beds were very comfortable too. We felt comfortable knowing that staff checked people for their room key;5
Doble bedroom , beds to small for a family of 3. Only complain was our bedroom was not clean on new years day. Would like to to see in the future a coffemaker in rooms. Front desk were nice and resolve any problems we had. We also like to see policemen in the premises during the New Years holiday. We certainly would return.;5
The hotel has old world charm but the bathrooms could use a little updating. There is little to no counter space. I did appreciate having 2 beds. The staff at the hotel are great. We didn't require much but it was great to know they were able to assist when we needed them.;5
Cool spot to chill in  Hollywood. Pil was with it, he knows the spots to visit when in town. At check in he was quick which is needed. The stay was cool, would have liked more attention from the front desk besides Pil. Rooms are small but comfortable. Id say solid hotel for LA. Would come back if im in town.;5
From the moment we arrived we were completely looked after. This is the first place Iâve ever stayed in where every detail has been given upfront on check in.   We had just arrived after 3 days in the Sahara desert, including riding camels and camping overnight. It was such a treat to find out that laundry was included with our booking!! Another first!   Freshly made coffee and tea, amazing two-part cooked breakfast and water all included too! Fresh fruit daily available everywhere throughout the riad.  The staff were all so friendly, helpful and accommodating. They even chased down shisha for us late in the evening.   The room was lovely, serviced twice daily. Breakfast on the rooftop terrace was fantastic overlooking a beautiful view of the Medina and the Atlas Mountains. We;5
All I have to say is all the best. The room was big enough, the bathroom is brand new and clean. maybe a little noisy because it was on the 5th floor, but not too noisy for us. Friendly staff and Julian was very helpful. sometimes the wi-fi was a too slow. there was a complimentary coffee for the guests in the breakfast room which was very nice. Near Times square (10 min) and the metro and bus;5
Great hotel, staff so helpful and location ideal for visiting New York city.  I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel again.  Beds were so comfortable after an exhausting day shopping and visiting sites.  Bar staff and atmosphere Great!;5
location of this hotel was perfect.I loved my stay..Rooftop lounge is so nice..I visit NY often but I never stayed near central park..it was nice..walking distance from a mall..a train stop from Times Square;5
All the staff was very friendly and helpful. Employees who seen you in the morning recognized you when you returned later that day and asked about your day.  Major KUDOS to Lucas at the front desk.  He went out of his way to make sure that my granddaughters birthday went recognized.   We did not utilize the restaurant however we did eat lunch by the pool and and room service for breakfast 1 day.  Both were very good and prices matched pretty much all other eateries.  The only area I found highly over priced was the gift shop especially for items you might have forgot to pack from home.;5
After a long 14hr flight from Sydney we had a wonderful welcome from Jerome at the front desk. He made a fantastic first impression of the hotel. We stayed in a double queen room on the 17th floor and is was more than comfortable for 2 adults and 2 teens. We used the shuttle service to Universal when it was raining and walked when it was dry. It was such a short walk. We hired a car so we were able to explore on our own and the self parking was easy and parking spots were always available. We will be back;5
We had the pleasure of staying with Valentina and the team (it felt more like a family really) for five nights and have never felt more welcome. The personal service was second to none with nothing too much trouble. We really felt they wanted our holiday to be as smooth as possible, and coming to Riad Kheirredine after the chaos of Marrakech was like an oasis of calm. Elena was a delight to talk to and ensured we always had everything we needed, and the entire stay was flawlessly organised and smoothly run. We will certainly be recommending this hotel to everyone we know.  Thank you so much to the whole team!;5
We had a wonderful time here. It was a short walk to Universalâs front gate, the rooms were clean, hotel was pretty, the kids loved the pool and my husband and I enjoyed the pool cocktails available after a long day. Close to the Hollywood sign too for some tourist photos.;5
Decided to stay here again. Solo this time. Still a good review! Room didnt have a view at all but i wasnt fussed i was literally in the room just to drop bags or sleep. Bed was comfy after a long day in the city. Very close to everything. Staff was friendly as always. Rooms are small but for a solo traveller it was perfect. Will be back again!;5
We booked two double beds with a pull out sofa and ended up getting upgraded to a Premier Suite on the 38th Floor! The room was amazing! My husband and I got our own room while our three boys shared an enormous living room space that accommodated two rollaway beds flanking the double pullout sofa! There was also two full bathrooms and a Six seater dining table!  The hotel gave us two complimentary breakfast vouchers for each day and it was a great savings to us. The restaurant was also located in the hotel (Tick Tock Diner) and was very reasonably priced for a breakfast place. Housekeeping were also fantastic providing water and soft drinks in our mini fridge. The only thing missing was walking out onto the balcony but with the view we didn't miss it. We felt like celebrities!;5
We went to the Empire Hotel to celebrate my friends birthday this week and the bar staff went out of their way to make sure she had a great time when they found out it was her birthday we even had a manager Eric Texidor come to us to see if she was having a good time and if there was anything he can do to make it even more special this staff really went above and beyond and they seem to have a great manager;5
We were very happy with our stay here.  The hotel is expensive, but very well maintained and clean.  Our room was super clean at all times and very spacious. The grounds even have a resort like feel.The staff is very friendly as well. There is a convenient shuttle that takes you to and from Universal which will save you $25 for parking.;5
Lovely lovely hotel.  Staff was so accommodating.  Prepare yourself for the location - it is in the middle of the old walled city - no cars - easy to get lost.  The location only added to the charm and sense of adventure.  Rooms were lovely, clean, well stocked.  Common areas were ample and very cozy.  Our favorite spot was the rooftop to watch the sunset every night.;5
Wonderful hotel! Great location! Spacious rooms very clean. Friendly staff! Great rooftop bar with a wonderful view of the city! Very helpful...would definitely stay there again! The location was spot on!;5
Have been a Hilton Honors member for years, but Devang and his crew: Astrid, Roxy, Sabrina, Lisette N, Kevin and CP made my birthday exceptionally memorable!  Thank you all for your kindness...you are the best and the property is magnificent!  Cudos to your entire staff and if you are looking for a 5 star Hollywood experience, look no further!;5
Staying at this hotel was great!!! We say an excellent price on hotelrooms365.com for $99 a night. When we checked into the hotel on July 12th we were so amazed by how good it looked for such a low price.  At first we had one queen size bed, but we met the front desk clerk and asked her for a room with double beds and she let us switch for free.  Central park in right across the street.  I would recommend to take the subway train on 103rd street, it's alot closer and also safer.  My best friend and I had a wonderful time in New York.  The hotel guest were pretty nice.  We met such great people here.  Also I would recommend the C train, because it takes you to timesquare, canal street etc..  The D train takes you to Coney Island.  Staying here at this hotel was great.  It's right;5
First trip to california great hotel close to universal and a short drive to other studios .very safe and clean . Excellent staff and food.parking is on site and safe walking distance to city walk and universal. thank you;5
We spent a long weekend in NYC, and reserved a room at The Empire Hotel. Saw some bad reviews after booking and were concerned before we arrived. Bottom line: I don't understand the bad reviews (must be from extremely nitpicky people), because we had a great experience there. We arrived and they upgraded us to a King room. Cool decor, fantastic location (right across from Lincoln Center), great staff including Dennis (doorman), Jacques, Jamol to name a few. The rooftop bar is fantastic, and we enjoyed our conversation with bartender Zack. We highly recommend the Empire Hotel, and next time we're in NYC we'll be staying there again! The Empire Hotel helped make our long weekend in NYC a very special time. The Mexican restaurant Rosa Mexicano in the same building and PJ Clark's;5
Great location within walking distance of Central Park, museums, shopping and good restaurants.  Spacious room with two beds and a small sitting area overlooking the Lincoln Center.  Beds very comfortable with soft clean bedding.  The heating is a bit noisy at night - we turned it off for the night and stayed cozy under the down covers.  Staff were very attentive to our requests and room service was fast.;5
Love this Hotel, the Location is very central. Beautifully Furnished Lobby and Rooms. Very friendly staff very helpful. Would definitely recommend it to my best friends and family. Kind regards Aleksandra;5
When leaving the hotel I accidentally left my wallet on a bench in the lobby.  The bellman chased after me, but didn't catch me.  Within minutes, they had texted my cellphone to let me know they had my wallet and returned it intact.;5
Much love to the Hollywood hotel. Most places we came across were not active at all. Soon as we walked in Pil was the boss at hyping the hotel. For sure a must stop hotel for the younger crowd. Old school spot but chill. Must come.;5
This trip was arranged as a surprise by my wife for my 40th birthday. We were very pleased with the location, service, staff & room. Its well located away from the hustle & bustle of time square but close enough to other attractions such as the Lincoln centre & central park. Although the room was on the small side this did not spoil the overall experience at all. Room was cleaned everyday to a high standard. All mod cons, LCD TV, Wifi, foam mattress, aircon, nice bathroom furniture. Any queries were sorted out swiftly. When we return to NYC we shall definitely be revisiting the Empire Hotel;5
We've stayed at this Hilton multiple times.  This particular time was a family trip to Universal Studios meeting up with our daughter and her family.  We are Diamond members and used the online check-in picking out our room along with digital key.  Upon arrival our robes, slippers, water, etc. were in the room, and ready.  The only thing that could make this Hilton better would be an Executive Lounge.  I would imagine it is too large of a hotel to accomodate the Diamond members for this, as they are now allowing Gold members into the lounge as well.  So, we will not complain.  We always have a great experience at this hotel, and will return.;5
Convenient shuttles service, awesome welcoming staff, clean place, helpful people, good food, and closest to The studios. Clean bathrooms, with quality amenities. Spacious room with good view. Thank you for the free bottled water upon arrival and free refills;5
Great stay highly recommend  Location is great,   Highly recommend,  doormen very polite, hotel staff very polite,  made sure we had great directions , gave us great restrurant info   Roof top very relaxing!!;5
This was the perfect hotel for our trip to LA, a good price, clean, nice staff, lovely rooms and the reception staff were great, especially when one guy gave me his discount tickets for The Comedy Club which meant we got in for free, so pleasing and a great guy!! Every question asked and taxi's booked and arrived quickly. The perfect hotel;5
"Perfect Breakfast, awesome Omlettes!So delicious!;) It was near located to the Metro so that you only had to go a couple of minutes.  About 10-15 Minutes to Central Hollywood. I tried the Fitness Room and it was also good.  Can really recomend this hotel.";5
The room was beautiful. Mr. Mohammed, at the front desk, rocks. We arrived at the front desk and asked if it was possible to have an upgrade. He told us he would see what he can do given that the hotel was pretty full. He surprised us with a room that had a beautiful view of the empire state building. He called us 15 minutes later to ask us what we thought of the room. We were really impressed. Everything at the hotel was perfect. The suite we had included international calls and wifi.;5
Excellent Hotel.  Wonderful staff.  Safe and secure 3 minutes from everything.  I would recommend this hotel anytime.  We stayed for 3 nights and received excellent service and accommodation.  Tick Tock Diner was great as well.;5
Had the fortune to come across the Hollywood Hotel online and after having my fill of it's delightful and imformative website page I just had to book my stay. At check in I was treated like family by Pil ð who definitely adds to the charm of the hotel. He moved us to a fully remodeled room with a courtyard view which is to die for at night as well as the back of the building. I would like to thank the breakfast staff, the maids, and the other front desk staff, everyone made our stay amazing. Look forward to our next stay.;5
The hotel is conveniently located near to rail station. The hotel rooms were clean and our suite roomy. The service was great, with all staff polite and helpful. A grand hotel done in Art Deco. We will return.;5
The staff was very responsive to all our requests.  The shuttle to Universal Studios was dependable and timely.  Restaurant was excellent and service outstanding.  Front desk and Bell staff friendly and helpful.;5
Beautiful Riad tucked away in the bustling MÃ©dina. The rooms are gorgeous and super spacious and the pool/ terrace is a great feature. We had dinner every night on the terrace and the food was delicious. The service was absolutely amazing- breakfast is included and they give you a lot of food, they make up your room twice a day, free laundry service, and there is a guide to walk you back to the Riad. Marrakech is an adventure and coming back to the Riad every night was our sanctuary. Also, we got the hammam massage there and I can not recommend enough!;5
We have stayed at a lot of nice hotels around the world, but Riad Kheirredine is our new favorite.  It is an absolute oasis in the middle of busy (but wonderful Marrakech).  We could go on and on about the great rooms, food, rooftop terrace, but it is the staff that truly make it so special - everyone is great, but we would like to especially thank Sara, Ilyas, Sihan, Elena and Abrahim.  You made our stay fantastic.;5
It's been about 5 years since I have been to the park and I was very impressed with the additions to the park. Hogwarts attraction is amazing. Definitely worth going just for that. Only problem is after 5 pm they won't let you get back in unless you walk all the around the park to the entrance and then they put you in a single line that goes to the entrance. It really is a pain in the butt. The back lot tour was good. They added a couple new things that was worth seeing. Overall, well worth the trip.;5
Our first trip to NYC and we could not have chosen a better location or hotel for our stay. At check-in we were greeted by Gunita who on hearing it was our first visit and my Wife's Birthday during our stay, promptly arranged an upgrade the next day to a room with a great view and Proescco sent up that evening! The staff were friendly and polite at all times and the Concierge arranged a dinner reservation at the fabulous Marea restaurant even though we booked late into the evening  - a great restaurant for an indulgent dinner only a few blocks away).  The hotel itself has a great interior and decor throughout, the room was a decent size and modern in style. Outise at night was noisy but you would expect that in New York. Closing the windows did block out some of the noise but;5
Very convenient to many London sites. Staff was readily available to assist with any needs/questions. Comfortable bedding and clean accommodations!  Would highly recommend staying here for an enjoyable stay in the city.;5
If you are in New York to attend events at Lincoln Center, don't even think about staying any place but the Empire! You can leave the opera, ballet, or symphony, walk across the street, and be back in your room in 5 minutes without taking a taxi.;5
"Service was excellent in general, staff were helpful. I liked the room, though small very cozy; bed very comfortable. Showers and toilets were more than adequate, offering some glimpse of the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River. Would totally stay here again!!";5
We stayed here in May this year, great location coffee shop across the street brilliant, great bars and restaurants, xlnt for the subway a nice quiet place, we will stay there again. Only fault was the tv didn't work in every room a problem with the whole of the hotel, they were sorting, but to be honest it didn't bother me made a change no tv for a week;5
"Me and my mum spent 5 days in rhiad Kheirradine. If I had to think about something negative about the staying I couldnât find it. Everything was perfect; from the riad in general, the room, the food, the politeness of every employees. Iâd definitely go back there, 100%! Itâs really the best.";5
We left a part of our hearts in Marrakech  You are probably reading this review if you are scrolling through the hundreds of Riads in Marrakech and canât decide the perfect one, let me stop your search, this is the one. We would rate it 6* if we could, it is a true hidden gem deep within the walls of the Medina.   The Riad is honestly stunning, itâs spacious, clean and has a real sense of luxury while maintaining the cultural Moroccon flair. What really stands out here is the service, it was the best service we have ever received. The team go above and beyond and made us feel like royalty from the moment we landed.   Sara, Elena, Siham were all so welcoming and tailored our holiday to our wishes including personally preparing our room with my requests to celebrate my partners;5
The morning food was so good ! Thanks to Hugo !!!his omelettes and waffles were marvelous, Im so happy me and my gf are here in the hollywwood hotel because we can eat that delicious food every morning.  Suheb-;5
Great place to spend while in LA. Area is safe and the hotel was immaculate. Service is second to none. Loved the valet parking because it saved time. Just down the street there is lots to do in the area if youâre not going to LA downtown. I would highly recommend this hotel;5
I stay here often for work, and even though the dark color scheme is not exactly uplifting, the staff are very professional and personal. They respond quickly to requests and check in is always support quick. Nick was especially helpful getting me a room witha good view last time. Color scheme is pretty dark and heavy, but otherwise a great place to stay. Clean rooms, nice bed, etc.;5
Best hotel in NYC - great value, location, staff is second to none - all around great experience time after time!! Easy access to all the great experiences in the city, Lincoln Center, Fordham University, the restaurants are fabulous and easy to get to, let alone the access to Broadway.  Again - I will always stay at the Empire!;5
We ended our Route 66 road trip at this lovely hotel. Needed a quality hotel close to the airport to catch an early flight after spending some time on the road, which this hotel offered us. Comfortable rooms and lots of options to dine in the hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. Free shuttle service every 15 minutes to the airport.;5
We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. I would advise to prebook an Uber or Lyft from the airport for the best value.  The staff at the hotel were excellent and the reception staff as a whole were amazing and so helpful . I had sent the hotel several requests prior to our stay and Nicky responded within hours with super helpful advise. Itâs in a good location with a metro station only 2mins away. All in all a great stay with super helpful staff;5
We arrived at the New Yorker exhausted from traveling and Mohamed greeted us with a warm smile and fast service. He even offered to upgrade our room so we could have a better view of the city. I definitely recommend this hotel not just based on location but how the staff is so invested in your experience.;5
Thank you to the employees from The Hollywood Hotel for making it the best and comfortable place to stay. Ask for Pill at the front desk, heâs so helpful & will make sure that youâre comfortable with the room you got. Any questions I had, he was able to answer right away. Make sure to come back and visit, the most reliable place to stay. Thank you again Pil, youâre the best! You need a bonus and all that!;5
Our first time in Marrakech and the Riad Kherridene made the trip. The Riad is evertything that one expects of a gem just behind the dusty arcades winding through the Medina, you pass through the door into a spectatcular oasis like environment of plants, tiles, chic furniture, lemon tress and cool plunge pools deep within the full height, shaded atria. The staff treat everyone as personal friends and describe all the wheres and hows. The staff will guide you if you are unsure of directions and are all highly knowledgeable and happy to recommend the sights and the restaurants (nearby Limoni Italian and Latitude 31 courtyard dining well worth a visit). The Italian family owners have obviously brought a personal touch to every area and it makes for a beautiful, luxurious and clean;5
Confortable and clean bedroom, good breakfast and helpul team. I was traveling alone and felt very safe. Did not use all the facilities because I did not have the time. Nice yard to have a drink outside.;5
We were only here on a layover and needed somewhere close to the airport to sleep.  The shuttle runs 24 hours a day and was very convenient to get back and forth.  The hotel is very close to a runway so you will hear planes taking off very late, but it wasnât bad as I was tired and needed sleep, which came quickly in the comfortable bed.;5
The Hotel was close to the Metro Station that gets you everywhere.  Free breakfast was a plus.  Ali at the Front Desk desk was great.  He provided excellent customer service.  He made us feel welcome.  Everyone should stay here if they want to stay close to all the attractions.;5
I had a very pleasant stay in early December 2013. The property was well maintained and festively decorated. The staff was very helpful and happy to assist when called upon.  The food and beverage service was exceptional for our holiday party and the Sunday brunch.  The accommodations and location were very nice as well. Very enjoyable all around.;5
We stopped here for a week July 18 and found the hotel and staff to be fabulous. The tick tock dinner is also a great place to eat. 5 stars from me.   A special thank you to Mohammed on reception who rang a couple of time to check everything was ok. We also enjoyed a great view from our room.  The butcher and banker was also a nice quiet break from the crazy streets of New York  I would happily stop there again;5
I would not stay anywhere else in New York, but you must not take life too seriously. The history of this hotel is wonderful and if you enjoy boating and or its history then the little cozy room takes you on a trip back in time. The bathrooms down the corridors are immaculate and even when busy they all work very well. My friends from Australia also share my views on this hotel. Fabulous location, the bar is exotic and the restaurant is very European with great food and staff. The staff throughout are cheerful, helpful and good fun. We have walked the whole of Manhattan from this location, but just the surrounding area makes for an experience and a half - round the corner to the HighLine walking path - what a marvelous walk for both day and night!;5
I just had one of the best customer service experiences Iâve ever had... anywhere.  I made a bone-headed mistake and booked a room for my family to visit Universal Studios with my reward points, but I booked it for exactly one month later than I meant to. We drove three hours and arrived only to realize that we didnât have a room.  I was fully expecting to have to pay through the nose for a last-minute room and having to fight for hours to get my reward points back.  Instead, Christian A., Andy, and Kevin leapt into action. They called Hilton corporate on my behalf and had me a new room in record time. They also went above and beyond by ensuring I wouldnât be penalized by the rate difference and even gave us some extra perks for the âinconvenience,â even though it was was;5
Last minute reservation done on the Airtrain at JFK. My wife was sick and I didnât think we could make it all the way home. Chose this hotel because it was across from Penn (Now Moynihan) station. It was a busy time but the wait to check in was short and easy. Room was small but very nice. And the people, both guests and staff were great.;5
The hotel is right on Broadway near the Lincoln center.  Excellent location.  Walking distance to multiple restaurants and delis.  2 blocks west of Central Park.  Beautiful walk through the park to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Rooms may be small but are clean and well maintained.  Staff is very helpful.  We had to check out a day early due to our flight home being cancelled, checked out at 4pm, they did not charge us for our last night which we fully expected to pay for.   Plan to visit  New York in September, this is where we will stay!;5
I was invited to come here and grab a drink by a friend who was staying at your marvelous hotel on Friday evening. I must say I was very impressed! The bartenders were all extremely friendly and pleasant to chat with. The cocktail waitress who served us drinks while we sat in the lobby.... Vanessa I believe was her name, had a lovely personality and was very sweet and provided quick & top notch service. The lobby DJ was the cherry on top of our evening, as he provided an abundance of upbeat dance music infused with some jazz... such a nice touch to that beautiful room! He was very friendly and full of energy. Overall, everyone from the staff working that night was so pleasant and I plan to return soon with new friends. The rooms inside were very clean, and the I loved the;5
This was a nice place to layover on our trip to Maui. Close to the airport with airport transportation provided, and the breakfast buffet was good! Check in staff was super nice and helpful. We got there prior to check in and they were able to store our luggage for us,  while we went out for the day.;5
This our first trip to New York we were advised to book the Wyndham New Yorker.  After getting over how small all the rooms are in New York we found this hotel to be perfectly positioned for all our adventures. Macys two blocks east, Madison Square Garden one block south  and right above Penn St station. The hotel has a great diner attached along with a lovely Italian restaurant.  All rooms are styled in  art deco reminiscent of its former glory.  Well recommended for your first visit to see all the important visitor sights. Rockefeller Center , Empire State , Radio City, Times Square and Central Park.;5
We stayed at the Hilton LA as part of a drive up the coast and had a great stay. Staff was great and they gave us a room on the top floor overlooking the Hills. Room was spacious and clean every day. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel.  This hotel was also directly across the street from Universal City which was very convenient. There is also a great Jazz bar around a block away.;5
"Stayed here with my partner of a course of 10 days. Couldn't fault the hotel at all. It is very close to the main attraction Universal Studio's. This attraction can be either accessed by the free Shuttle Service which takes you there and back which runs every 15 minutes up until 9pm or it will take a 5-10 minute walk. The hotel room was cleaned daily, a great size and we had a great view. There is a coffee shop in the hotel where you can grab Breakfast or even Ice-Cream or there is a restaurant there where you can also get breakfast. The hotel in all is brilliant. It is a great location where the metro station is just down the road and is also close to Universal City; but it is also in reach of restaurants and other attractions.";5
We had an amazing time and experience. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They make you feel at home in this beautiful and crazy city.  The riad is about 10-15 min walk from the main area ( Jama el fnna) and all the restaurants and cafes. They walk with you to the Cafe arab every time you go out and they give you a cellphone to call once you want to meet again at the cafe to go back to the riad.;5
I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of my stay at the Jane! While I was a bit disappointed not to have a terrace, I quickly learned that those rooms are noisier because of the cafÃ© â so I think my floor was perfect.  Everyone I met was awesome, I loved the dÃ©cor â I borrowed a bike â the neighborhood and access to the High Line fantastic â and I loved loved loved your selection of in room snacks and drinks.  I even ate and drank in room which I usually never do â because of the cool things and the reasonable prices. Oh â and I LOVED the bathroom. Beautiful and excellent products.   It was the best hotel experience Iâve had for years! (and I have 30+ nights a  year). I had a Captains cabin.;5
My daughter and I opted for the Wyndham New Yorker because we would be leaving NYC via Amtrak from Penn Station and the location was ideal.  But everything else turned out to be excellent:  The room was clean, beds comfortable, and the view spectacular, even to a couple of people who know NYC well.  (And, yes, I do realize that not all rooms will provide that kind of view.)  Mohammed, our front desk clerk, welcomed us warmly and was very solicitous of my daughter who needs a cane.  He even double checked to ensure that our room would be functional for her.  I think that the prices are reasonable compared to others in the city. Do not miss the gallery on the lower level! The history of the New Yorker is the history of NYC in the 30's and 40's and the little museum is fascinating!;5
Really enjoyed my stay here.  My goal was to explore Hollywood & LA region via public transit & by foot. No cab. No Uber. Great breakfast buffet every morning to get you going. Staff really helpful in helping me map out areas I wanted to explore. Super easy access to transit & subway system. Neat gym & sauna. Pool area is spacious. Pil is the guy to go to if you need anything. All staff was great. Room had fridge & Microwave oven. Bed is comfortable. Room temperature easily adjusted. Been to some where that is not the case. Courtyard i found was great to relax in and read for a bit too. Would go again thanks Pil for your great service too.;5
So... I never usually write reviews unless I feel somewhere really deserves it.  First shout out to Nicole on reception, who got us checked in early for no extra cost around 9am after getting off a 13 hour flight from Australia. Nicole greeted us with a smile and we felt like we truly were starting our holiday.  We have actually stayed at the Hollywood hotel previously two years before. We loved it, and came back and spent two full weeks at the hotel this time as oppose to only the 4 days previously. We even got the EXACT same room 240, which we loved because it was more private away from the others so we could sleep.  The only downfall was when people wandered up and down the corridor talking on their phones they tended to head to our side of the hotel because there was a small;5
I travel and stay overnight in Manhattan often, and every time I'll always only stay at the New Yorker or another Wyndham property. Hands down the best hotel experience I ever have. Always super friendly staff, check in is fast, and the rooms are always clean and perfect.;5
Not the cheapest but in a top location for a visit to NY . Clean with friendly cooperative staff . Room was a bit on the small side but , hey , we were there to be out enjoying ourselves not moping about in a hotel room .Tick Tock diner  is good for breakfast .;5
Stayed one night at this hotel after a late flight from the East Coast. The shuttle picked us up from the arrivals area within 5 minutes and it was a short 5 minute drive to the hotel. Check In was fast and friendly. Hotels looks newly renovated - lobby areas and room were very nice. The one thing that stood out about this hotel was how quiet it was since it was in the middle of a major airport. We barely heard any jet noise and that is saying a lot for me as I am an extremely light sleeper. The hotel is a fortress with double pane windows which really keep all the noise out. Would highly recommend.;5
stayed at the hotel before and because it is in such a good Manhattan location stayed there again. Was on the top floor this time and same rooms. they are tiny, but for the price and since you are in NY you don't need more. Would stay again any time.;5
My family and I stayed last month for a few days. We were in town to see our daughter who lives close by the hotel. I was not happy with the hotel at first because of one girl at the desk at check in, I dont remember her name.She acted arrogant and ignored your questions when you ask her, like you were an inconvenience. It was a bad first impression, but the other staff members were Amazing! Especially Anna she was always kind and attended to us most of our stay. The room was very clean and had a small balcony. I was pleasantly surprised with the breakfast, omelettes and waffles made in front of you! The WIFI was free and a little spotty in the room, but we did not use it a lot. We did not have much time to use the other amenities at the hotel, but there was a pool and gym.;5
really enjoyed the stay, very nice hotel, lovely rooftop bar, excellent service ! would definitely say there again, lots of restaurants in the area, subway only a few steps away... lovely Lincoln Center just behind the corner, very nice;5
Great service from Bellman Dewayne and Doug. On check in and checkout. Nice rooms and service. I did not eat or get a drink at restaurant but people looked liked they enjoyed it. I would recommend to anyone wanting to be near LAX.;5
We checked in on 100 degree day in NYC, burdened down by our luggage and literally dripping in sweat. They checked us in early, handed us bottled water, confirmed our details, and sent us to the pool. The rooftop pool is small, but Iâm not sure what people expect 12 floors up. Itâs PERFECT for a dip, and the service at the roof top restaurant was great!  The hotel is easy access to the 1, A, B, C, D metro lines, all via Columbus Circle metro, abuts Central Park, and is adjacent to Lincoln Center.   Our room was even a touch bigger than a traditional NYC hotel room.   Really outstanding, we will be back!   Shout out to Luis at the front desk.;5
I was having a horrible experience in LA but then I found this hotel and the front desk girl Mylka really helped me out and made my experience much better . I would recommend staying . Thanks so much folks;5
The Hyatt Regency was overall very clean, had excellent customer service and assisted us with anything and everything we needed during our short stay. They made us feel safe with their COVID safety. I would 100% recommend them and will be returning in the future.;5
This hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of everything..close to Broadway and times square, next to Madison sq garden, walking distance to the empire state building, and right around the corner from penn station, where you catch the subway.  Restaurant in the hotel is also very good.  Thought it was a bargain for the price given the location.;5
Amazing hotel, the most amazing place I've been to!!  Terrific service, the staff are caring and supportive.  We stayed here as a family, twice last year and this June. Amazing.;5
I was recommended The Jane by a good friend who stays there on a regular basis, and I wasn't disappointed. From the bell-hops, to the amazing room we were given, from the decor to the stunning ballroom/bar - all something to remember. The heating in the room was the only issue, but that was dealt with immediately, so I am not complaining. It's off the beaten track, but so close to the High Line and the new Whitney. Plus you are spoilt for choice with the restaurants in the area.;5
This is a wonderful hotel, have stayed here a few times now and each time it has been great. The Hilton Universal is located in a fantastic position, right opposite Universal Studios and CityWalk so it is extremely convenient. The quality of the hotel is excellent with confortable rooms and lovely beds. The hotel has a great swimming pool and spa just great after a long day sightseeing. The only downside and it is only a small thing is the in room internet, it would be great if there was no charge but the $8 fee per day is not bad, certainly better than some hotels that charge $20.  I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and will definately stay here again.;5
Huge hotel. Lobby is luxurious. Rooms are spacious, with amazing view. I had in room dining service which was perfect. Nice and clean pool. Staff helpful and polite. Near Universal Studios which was really good for me! Everything was great :);5
"I have stayed with my family at this exceptional Riad and we have memorable souvenirs of our trip. Everything exceeded our expectations: ranging from the very warm welcome at the airport through the airport transfer and throughout our stay. The inner courtyard with the vitality pool is of a jaw dropping beauty. As soon as you enter the riad, you have a sense of tranquillity never experienced before. The quality of the service is simply unrivalled. The staff is proactive and really anticipates all your needs. You really feel ""at home away from home"" and pampered by the staff. The little cherry on the cake was the quality of the food and italian wines: mouthwatering dishes prepared with care and the highest quality of ingredients are accompanied by a selection of italian wines.";5
This hotel is nice. Valet, beautiful lobby, nicely decorated inside, beautifully landscaped outside, plenty of staff to help you, gift shop with snacks and drinks, restaurant, buffet, properly heated pool with a large hot tub, plenty of elevators, nice room views, comfortable beds, quiet AC, EASY walk to Universal Studios and the City Walk. Would 100% stay here again. My only complaints were the shower was low water pressure and didn't get hot enough, hot but not HOT like I like. Also, one of our pillow cases seamed clean but was stained with make up or something which was a little gross. They had tons of pillow though so we didn't use that one. Oh and we had to go to the lobby to ask for pool towels because there weren't any. The rest of the hotel was nice and had a perfect;5
We stayed here for our first night in California specifically for it's location next door to universal, and it really is NEXT DOOR. From the front door you can walk to the park entrance and Universal CityWalk in 4-5 minutes.  The room was massive, clean, very comfortable and a had a great view of North LA. The front desk staff where great and very helpful. The morning buffet was excellent with an extremely varied assortment of European, Asian and American items.  Parking was about $14 for the night.;5
Enjoyed my stay and business event in this hotel 2 weeks ago. Loved the ambiance of this hotel, great location, great food, amazing staff. Huge thank you to Gregory Cau and Jose Galeano for making this an unforgettable event! Will be back.;5
We would like say that we were taken care of and it was nice to be spoiled. Jermaine was patient we were tired, hungry, and ready to rest and he showed us some rooms before settling down. the rooms are nice i want them to be better but with a 98avg rate we were happy. spacious room with free coffee and tea was great. Pool outdoors, gym, gift shop, and sauna were quite nice. We do hope in years time this place is gutted and make into a 5 star which it deserves to be. My family enjoyed the stay.;5
We absolutely loved this hotel. The rooms were large and the view from the 15th floor was awesome! The shuttle was extremely convenient and very prompt. Beds were comfortable. Rooms were very clean and looked brand new!;5
I had a meeting in New York city.  I come from a small town in the midwest.  I was out of my element to say the least.  The staff was outstanding and extremely helpful.  The location was great.  Walking distance to several restaurants, bars and half a block to the subway. I stayed on the club level.  The room was in perfect order and had everything I needed.;5
Visiting NY for the first time from California and we found this hotel via trip advisor. We stayed at YOTEL for one night before but found the rooms to be a little dirty and really expensive. So we decided to come to Ameritania and we wish we did so from the beginning. For almost $50 less we got clean rooms that is really close to all the tourist attractions.  The staff was very professional and courteous. One of the staff members named Jeff Banks was especially exceptional and offered us really good rates to JFK airport. I wanted to name him specifically for being a great host and would definitely stay here again.;5
I have been staying here since August 2020 due to the pandemic and me working in a COVID positive facility, I got lucky to have the opportunity to stay in this hotel and make it my temporary home away from home during my encounter here Iâve had nothing but great and amazingly experiences here with all staff especially one in particular Pil heâs always with a great attitude and is very welcoming when needing help or having questions this is a place where I would want to come again and stay thanks to Pil with his amazing customer service and patience and professionalism attitude.;5
Picked the hotel as they have family rooms. Room was huge and had a lovely view. We decided to eat there for dinner and the food was delicious. Kids loved it too.I would highly recommend this for a family stay.;5
We spent 3 nights at Riad Kheirredine at the beginning of March. From beginning to end our experience was excellent. By definition, you expect a stay in a Riad to be a mysterious experience - you enter a door in a wall in the centre of the Medina, a door you would not even notice , down an alleyway you would miss, and the door opens onto a fantastical multi layered home that you would not even guess existed from the exterior. Riad Kheirredine does not disappoint on any level. Our room was lovely, probably one of the smaller ones (although we did not see inside any others) but still beautifully decorated with everything you could need to hand and a lovely bathroom but all exactly what you would expect from an old building albeit brought up to date with modern comforts.  There are;5
Got a great rate by booking 60 days in advance. Flew into Newark (Liberty) and took NJ Transit to Penn Station. The hotel is 1 block for the E line's 7th Ave & 53rd St station. 5 min walk to Times Sq / Theater District or Rockefeller Center / FAO Schwartz or The Park. Good restaurants nearby. Ask Alexis at the front desk for anything. She knows the city, is super helpful, has her finger on the pulse of what's going on and will definitely be able to address your needs and concerns. Would stay here again.;5
Hotel was very accomodating towards us despite the short notice. Front Desk Pil was the one who assisted us and he made sure we feel safe and satisfied in our hotel room. He went above and beyond our expectations. We also noticed that he is very hard workingâ even though it is obvious that he's tired, he still give his best smile to the visitors. Huge thanks to you, Pil! And we'll surely be back here in Hollywood Hotel. ð¥°;5
stayed over Christmas 4 days room 3408 was really good, hotel is a bit dated but meh i don't bother much about looks. the bed was comfy shower was AMAZING like a new layer of skin each time( TALK ABOUT A POWER SHOWER) lols it was really good.  the view was reasonable we could see the edge observatory from our room which was cool   great location in NYC once we learnt how to use the subways it was so easy to scoot over the town and allways head back to PENN Station as the hotel was right above the station so super easy to get home and head out.  security was making sure the guests are the only ones in the hotel they ask for room keys to be seen which is good, they have no issues with you taking food back to your room again bonus, we got some joe's pizza from times square and it;5
Booked 4 nights in new yorke, as it 1st visit to usa I was a bit apprehensive. When checking in was informed we had been upgraded to bigger room. 2 rooms with a balcony/sun deck. View was fantastic. Service from everyone from cleaning lady to front desk was top class. Would I stay here again? In a heartbeat yes I would. Location is so central to everything from Macys to time square  Great hotel cant thank you enough for my time there.;5
Outstanding location for a weekend getaway at Universal Studios. Walking distant to the park and restaurants. This Hilton handles a great number of guest and makes it look flawless.   The hotel was recently updated. Nice new interiors and comfortable rooms. Please understand because of this amazing location the hotel does have a ton of kids. Kids will be kids and aren't always the quietest.    The breakfast buffet is definitely worth it. They have a amazing selection and fresh made items. Starting with a good breakfast was easy before hitting the park.   The Hilton team goes above and beyond. They want your stay to be enjoyable. It's not an inexpensive place to stay however well worth it. I highly recommend This Hilton.;5
Wonderful place and would definitely stay here again if I go back to New York. The room had a view of the Empire State Building and was beautiful. They upgraded  for free at check-in and also the room was ready when we got there at 1:30 p.m. The room had been upgraded and even included bottled water that the housekeeper left more each day at no charge. Great location;5
We stayed here for the first part of our honeymoon and cannot say enough good things about Riad Kheirredine. The service was outstanding, by far the most accommodating of any hotel in which I ever stayed. All of the staff were extremely helpful, polite, and professional, but also very warm and welcoming. Our first night we had dinner on the rooftop of the riad and it was the most wonderful experience- I highly recommend it! The food was excellent and plentiful and the view and atmosphere was incredible. The riad was especial delightful to come back to after a hectic day in Marrakesh because it was so clean and calm. Also, the phone was very helpful and Ishmail was a great guide. Just all around 5 stars!;5
great front desk service will come again!! Awesome customer service very considerate. The pool and gym were open and clean . Very neat room covers changed and fresh water at front desk! Pil is great!!;5
We stayed two nights.  Our room was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  We had a great view but others who were with us said their view was a wall.  The hotel is decorated in dark colors but that is fine.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The hotel is in a great location, just a few blocks from Central Park and across the street from Lincoln Center.  My Fair Lady is playing there.  There is an indoor TKTS Discount Ticket Booth at Lincoln Center.   We were able to get discounted tickets for a same day matinee and we walked the 20 blocks to and from the theatre.  There was a Keurig coffee maker in the room but no room service.  We enjoyed the roof top bar.  We will definitely stay here again and I am already planning it.;5
My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in June 2008.  Staff were great and the room was very clean, spacious, and had a great view.  I think our favorite part of it was the outdoor pool area.  The pool was clean and was the perfect temperature.  It also had a poolside bar where you could purchase drinks and snacks.  It is located in Universal city just steps away from Universal Studios and the City Walk which was awsome.  I would definatley stay at this hotel again in the future.;5
"I needed a quick getaway with my wife, and booked a ""4 star hotel in the central park area"" on Hotwire, not knowing what I would get. The service was excellent; the room beautiful and very clean; the staff accomodating in every way.";5
Letâs start with the arrival. It was our first time in Marrakech. Walking through the medina was both chaotic and beautiful. We were glad to have the help of the Bell Boys who navigated us through the streets as they became narrower and narrower. The moment we walked into Riad Kheirredine, we were greeted with the smell of roses. Weâre not joking. It smells amazing. Amal then walked us over to a pool-side couch where she had lemonade, figs, and walnuts to recharge us after our long day of traveling. We couldnât stop smiling. The contrast between the medina and this oasis was something weâll never forget.  Next, Amal went through our itinerary day-by-day. Before we arrived, Amal and the rest of the staff had been instrumental in helping us plan as well as booking the guides and;5
Service was excellent, clean and efficient.   We felt comfortable and safe!  Maurice from Oklahoma was our check in person and we loved him.  The breakfast was delicious and very international.  Loved everything!;5
Amazing hotel. Extremely friendly. Breakfast was amazing as there was a large selection of bacon, sausages and eggs along with orange juice. Would definitely return again. Doormen were very friendly and kind and always said good morning when you exited the hotel. Highly recommend this hotel.;5
My favorite hotel in NYC !  The hotel is conveniently located to good restaurants, Lincoln Center, Central Park, museums, etc.  The staff is helpful and accommodating.The rooms are nice and some have great views.;5
"The Empire Hotel proved a great place to stay last week.  Checkin was fast and I was upgraded to a nice junior suite with a bar, fridge, couch and chairs, huge bath, and really comfortable bed.  Lots of outlets for plugging things in.  Room was spotless.  View and ambiance of rooftop bar excellent.   One minor drawback - elevators really slow in morning, hotel must use them for service too; literally allow five minutes extra to get down.  Price reasonable but expected given its distance to high density corporate areas.";5
Stayed in the Hilton Universal City for 6 nights in September 2009 and to be honest this is a superb Hotel. From the friendly very efficient Staff, the beautiful rooms to the magnificent food I could not find any fault what so ever. Would gladly stay here again without any hesitation.;5
Most friendly and helpful receptionist ever, so lovely and great first impression of hotel. Couldn't have been more sweet, they ensured me my car would be safe in the parking lot. The three angles went beyond the call of duty by helping me print important documents that I needed for an impotant event that I was attending   Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional, and I don't give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable.  I was very pleased with my stay, and although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future. Just want to say thank you again to the three angels at the front desk.;5
Everything about our stay at this hotel on the night of May 17th was copacetic. Our two rooms were completely clean and sanitized and the hotel was very, very clean. As noted by other folks reviewing this property Kevin is a tremendous asset to this hotel.  The entire hotel experienced a power outage at 6 in the morning for about two hours but the emergency power came on and the hallways were all lit properly. The phones worked too. The only food available was from room service (continental breakfast) which was lovely, hot and delicious.  Until the adjacent Universal Studios is re-opened this will be a quiet hotel...this was quite surreal as occupancy must have been around 5 % of normal capacity. Parking is convenient and accessible. A great experience, highly recommend and;5
Just returned from a short, but beautiful stay in the Riad Kheirredine!  Our family of 5 were more than blown away by the efforts of Valentina, Jonathan, Ishmael, and Abdu!  From the moment we walked in, they went out of their way to exceed our expectations.  Valentina and Jonathan were beyond helpful in planning our day of sight seeing, while Ishamel and Abdu ensured our comfort and put us at ease, escorting us throughout the medina.  Who goes out of their way to provide us with a cell phone for use during our stay, breakfast requests that fit each of our preferences, and send us off with a fresh batch of my favorite moroccan coconut cookies!  Riad Kheirredine does!!  Thank you for such a memorable stay in Marrakech!  We will DEFINITELY be back again!;5
We stayed here for four nights the hotel is in a great location staff were helpful and friendly room was very clean and comfortable tick tock diner is on ground floor of hotel we used it every day food and service was excellent also there are two other restaurants in the hotel our first time to New York hopefully if we return we wouldn't hesitate to use the New Yorker again.;5
Great place to stay to visit the parks!! 5 minute walk and you are in the park. Great room, spacious with lots of amenities (coffee maker, toiletries). We took a walk into the neighbourhood for a great breakfast and rode back up 'the hill' on the free transport provided by the park. We ordered takeaway and the concierge called up to the room when ut arrived. Great loaction!;5
I came back from Marrakech 2 days ago after spending 4 nights at Riad Kheirredine with my friend and our stay there was amazing. The Riad is so beautiful and is truly an oasis from the hectic streets of Medina but the best thing about the Riad is the service provided by the lovely staff.     The staff will go above and beyond to make your stay the best possible stay and take care of you 24/7. All types of drinks and fruits are offered free of charge and can be had anywhere in the riad at any time. This also goes for breakfast which can be had at any time, anywhere, which was perfect for us since we like to sleep in. Other services such as booking restaurants, excursions and just providing you with the normal touristy info is always provided with great enthusiasm and it's clear;5
"The room was a bit small but this was expected this was New York after all. I would say the room was average at best.  Not much time was spent in the room anyway. I didn't hear much noise from the street or the hallways as the room was right next to the elevator. The bathroom was very, very small without a fan so the mirror fogs up after a shower. The staff was friendly but the one member that stands out was Tommy the doorman. He was more than happy to tell us about the hotel and talk ""Gilmore girls"" We were treated like VIP's by him and he even took time out to show us some of the sights from the hotel itself, and was not bothered when we asked if he could take a picture or two. Thank you to Tommy and hope to see you around on our next trip.";5
I was a regular hotel guest many years ago.  Upon returning 10 years after my last stay, Pamela Collins, the front desk supervisor, not only recognized me but took care of me and my family during our springbreak with great care.   Pamela exhibited exemplary customer services and warmth typically reserved for immediate family.   Because of Pamela, Iâll always return to and recommend the Universal Hilton.       I also want to recognize the hotel leadership.  I also saw many familiar faces at the front desk, restaurants and bell desk.   These hotel jobs have long hours and can be challenging at times given the wide range of customers.  I want to recognize the efforts by hotel leadership and owners on retaining top talents.;5
Value for money. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel perfect location for Central Park and Times Square - both in easy walking distance. Beds are super comfy and the linen and towels are beautifully clean.;5
This was my second stay at the Hollywood Hotel and again I am impressed with the service. Our first encounter was with Gisel on the front desk. She was very pleasant, always smiling, and offering information and input with out being asked. We were using public transit and presented her with many questions , but not once did she show frustration or make us feel as tough we were a bother....two thumbs up to Gisel.  Then there was the staff of the restaurant where we received a free breakfast each morning.. The main male cook ( whose name we didn't get:( ) was very friendly and made an amazing omelette. Then there was Sonia who, after we mentioned needing gluten free, informed us that she could make  us gluten free waffles. we felt this was a grand gesture as it was a very busy;5
I missed my flight at LAX and check-in staff could tell I was stressed. I was treated with kindness, got a higher floor, and complimentary water/dessert. Room was very modern and clean. Would definitely recommend if you need someone convenient and close to LAX.;5
"I came to Marrakech with my daughter for five days and we chose to stay at the Riad Kheirredine. They made us feel so welcome and could not have been more helpful. We felt very safe in their care as they gave us a mobile phone to ring them with should we get lost. Needless to say that we used the phone a good few times! They were extremely thoughtful, one morning, I mentioned that it had been my daughter's birthday two days before and later that evening they sent us up a beautifully decorated chocolate cake free of charge. All the staff; Yajaira, Valentina, Elena, Ibrahim, Shoki and Abdu (sorry if I forgot anyone) made our stay one to remember. They organised an airport transfer, a day trip and they sent an escort out with us at night or when we were going to a new place. The";5
Our stay was great! From reservations to front desk, each person that assist me plan this birthday trip for my boyfriend was super helpful and friendly. They even refrained from mentioning the room number to maintain the Tesla Room surprise for him! As a Tesla nerd, he was stoked just to be IN the New Yorker.....staying in room 3327 was the perfect gift!  The room was a tad small (considering the price) but as it IS Manhattan, it was to be expected and did not at all take away from the stay. The room was clean and comfortable with a view of Empire State. My boyfriend gave thumbs up to the deep tub in the bathroom too. We would definitely stay again and recommend!!;5
Fast, friendly, efficient and awesome location.   Stayed at several hotels in Manhattan and the empire by far the best.  Love the overhead shower, makes it feel like it's raining on you. Took advantage of the promo deal and got a great price!!  Definitely recommended!!;5
The hotel was very nice. It was clean, comfortable and attractively furnished with a nice large lobby.  The hotel had a nice current but yet retro feel to it.  The staff were excellent (Daniel was top notch).    We would definitely stay here again.;5
Just got back from the hotel within past few days.  This is a superb hotel with such attentative staff and beautiful rooms/terrace.  We stayed in the new part of the Riad and in the Lotus room.   Food was very tasty each time we ate there - and can't fault the breakfasts either.   We also done the Hammam and massage, a very relaxing way to end the week.   I will definitely be returning and using the Riad again.  Thank you to all the staff :-)  I will definitely be returning;5
This hotel is in an excellent location, less than 5mins walk from Universal Studios. The staff are very friendly and helpful, breakfast buffet is very good and the food is fresh. The hotel is spotless and rooms cleaned everyday. Would go here again.;5
I am just back from 6 nights staying at the Empire Hotel (29/12/14-03/01/15) I can honestly say the hotel exceeded my expectations. The room we had was spacious with a reasonable sized bathroom (some may find it small but it was exactly what we needed for 2 people).  Our room was 1122 and we had an excellent view of the surrounding area. We could hear the roof top bar in the wee hours on New Year's Eve but due to being out quite late ourselves it didn't stop us from sleeping.  We found the hotel to be in a great area with many sights only a short walk away (central park in particular).  All of the staff could not have been more helpful (apologies that I cannot remember particular names as we met so many staff), door men were polite, friendly and happy to engage in a bit of light;5
We totally enjoyed our stay. Rooms were large and spacious. Rooftop deck was contemporary and comfortable. Service excellent. Suggestions for what to do were perfect              We will DEFINATELY be returning here.;5
I stayed here in October 2018 due to its proximity to the garden as. I had booked tickets to see the eagles. The rooms were clean and spacious and check in is easy. Stayed there last year as well although the view from the room was poor this year. This hotel is in a great location for Times Square, Broadway and the Empire State buildings. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  Staff were very helpful with bus booking etc and were very informative about New York making our stay that much easier. We had a flooded room one night that was immecistely attended to. Canât thank the staff enough. Will definitely be back.;5
We stayed here in June 2014 and it was simply brilliant !! The location is brilliant with a direct train / tube station to JFK only a few hundred meters away.  The staff were very helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out. In particular the bar staff Jerrard and his co-worker ( I think he was called Frank) were brilliant. During our stay the weather was brilliant so we used the pool deck in the afternoons where there is a great little bar with smiling happy staff which makes a sunny afternoon even more enjoyable. The bar manager who oversees all these guys was called Joe Prete and really is doing a fantastic job as smiling friendly staff really does make such a difference to your holiday !! Away from the bars and staff the hotel in itself is;5
Great location to explore New York from.We stayed for 5 nights last July and found our room  spacious with two queen sized beds and two bathrooms..very comfortable and spotlessly clean.The staff were friendly and helpful and check in and out was seamless although quite busy.My husband especially enjoyed chatting with Mike in the lobby.We are very much looking forward to staying there again this July.ð;5
In the heart of Lincoln Center neighborhood, the Empire Hotel meets all your needs for day-tripping or business.  Rooms are clean, efficiently meet your needs, and unbelievably quiet for being in the heart of performing arts and the city-life around it.  Roof Top Bar is beautiful to start your journey into the city night, or to end it in a city that never sleeps!  I stayed here for both business and fun and it is my best choice on the west side!  Close to Columbus Circle and subways (not to mention shopping, theatre, and Central Park) it's convenience cannot be beat.  Staff are exceptional, and wise in assisting.  Beds were comfortable, ac unit worked great (and not noisy) and the bathroom had a power shower to get you awake and ready for city-fun/work or wind down after a day;5
"We were most impressed with the accommodations and services at the Empire! Wonderful location; close to Central Park and subways. Although we really enjoyed the rooftop restaurant/lounge and the tasty food, we were disappointed with the service (forgot our napkins and utensils until after eating most of our meal).";5
This hotel is very well situated, near to Times Square and Central Park. We really felt safe and considered in this hotel : from the checkin to the check out, everything was perfect. A very big thank you to Jeff that welcomed us so well, and booked our taxi to go back to JFK Airport. He answered all the questions we had, and was always available. A very big thank you to the reception team too, that has been so nice to us, and welcomed us very well. The room was clean and confortable. We slept very well on the bed, and the pillow was very comfortable.  We will go back to Ameritania at Times Square for sure !!! Thank you once again to all the team of this wonderful hotel !;5
"If you read the last nightmare I had at a Universal Studios hotel, this one was a dream come true. Arrived at noon and was able to check in early which was important so we could go right to Universal.  My front desk help was very friendly (wish I could remember his name to give him props), he explained everything to me and did not make me feel rushed or annoyed.  Shuttle to Universal runs every 15 minutes and no need to sign up or reserve a spot days in advance like the ""other hotel"".   Rooms were clean and comfortable, and toiletries were top of the line which makes you feel a little pampered.  My only complaint would be having to pay for parking, but that seems to be the norm anymore, even with not so great hotels.  All in all, I left happy and would def stay there again.";5
WHAT WE LIKED: The lobby and rooms were in excellent condition considering how much traffic this property must get and how old it is (Caveat:  I read negative reviews about rain intrusion and elevator refurbishment - we didn't encounter any of those issues) The valet, front desk, and Cafe Sierra staff provided excellent service.  The continental breakfast offered smoked salmon and brie, which easily made it the nicest continental breakfast I've had in a long time. The location is excellent for going to Universal Studios - it's a very short walk.  WHAT COULD BE BETTER: Self-parking is $28, and if you check out, then after 6 pm, you'll charged another $17 for the next hour.  So we cut our Universal visit short to come back and get our car out. The room desperately needs a towel;5
This was our first visit to LA. This property location was exceptional from check-in to check-out. Staff was so friendly and helpful with all our questions. Room was large with a great view. Breakfast was very good with a large selection. All the restaurant staff went out of their way to accommodate the guests. I also want to commend the staff on their efforts during the 2 1/2 hour power outage that occurred during our stay, as a result of a motor vehicle accident nearby. Things went as smooth as possible and everyone seemed to do their part. We will definitely visit this property again and I look forward to it!;5
Great central location between time square and central park. Walk or short metro ride to all the tourist attractions. Cafes, restaurants at your door step. We got in at 7am in the morning and they were able to check us in to a room, which we really needed! Jeff at the door was so helpful that in our sleepy state, we didn't have to ask for anything, he had it covered.  Bags, the bag storage, leaving time, the car, etc etc. Enjoyed our stay. Tks Jeff and ameritania.;5
I had never heard of this perfect all-suite hotel. I stumbled across it and am so glad I did. I was there for business and the suite was accommodating, relaxing and had everything they had advertised on their site. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was courteous, attentive and polite. Management was terrific! The food is great and reasonably priced and unfortunately, I only had the chance to order room service and not go and dine in their restaurant or roof top area. The hotel is located in a safe and very quiet residential area. It is truly a gem! When travelling to the LA area again I will not hesitate to stay there for business or pleasure.;5
The staff welcomed me constantly, not just when I arrived. It was not forced but genuinely friends, and made for a wonderful stay. I loved my room (King with a view of the park), and the parking lot was easy to navigate (I went in and out many times during my stay) and never experienced any problems .;5
This trip was a birthday present from my sons. Staying at the Empire Hotel was one of many highlights of the trip. The hotel was beautiful and the staff was great. I use a walker, and for this trip my sons rented me a scooter to get around the city on. The Front Desk had the scooter waiting on me at arrival, and the Bell Staff handled the drop off on my departure. The Housekeeping staff was amazing with my requests for a couple of accessible items. Thank you Empire Hotel for an amazing 1st trip to NYC, and early birthday.;5
Our breakfast service was wonderful. We enjoyed our meal. Our server, Rosendo, was very kind. Everything was to our liking. In spite of it being busy,, we were able to get our food quickly and we did not have to wait.;5
Clean, modern and quiet rooms. Itâs close to the airport, but also close to the city life. They offer a free airport shuttle, which runs every 10minutes or so. The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing. For members youâll get free access to Regency club who offers breakfast, mid-day snack, drinks and a pre-dinner snack. You also get a late checkout if you want to, I stayed until 2pm, and that was great.;5
Our 1st visit to Marrakech and after looking around on TripAdvisor, decided to stay at Riad Kheirredine.  Communication via email with Manuella and Marco at the Riad was very good.  I mentioned that my girlfriendâs birthday fell on our last day there and was able to arrange a surprise dinner and birthday cake for her (more on this later). On arrival at the airport, we were met by a driver who drove us to the Sidi Ben Slimane (nearest drop off point to the Riad) where we were met by Manuella and a local lad with a trolley for our luggage, who guided us to the Riad.  5 minutes later we reached the Riad and entered a beautiful, peaceful courtyard, where we were welcomed with Mint Tea and local fruit, while our cases were taken up to our room.  Wonderful!  We loved the Riad!  Iâd;5
Pros: location, comfortable bed, well-appointed bathroom, location Cons: no handicap accessibility at front of hotel  I recently traveled to NYC with my husband and 2 of my children. We stayed at 3 hotels of similar price. The Paramount, The Empire and The Ameritania.   The Paramount was right in the middle of Times Square the the Theater District which made it extremely crowded and the room was cramped. The lobby was nice and the room was quiet with a city view. There was almost no room between the foot of the bed and the wall.  The Empire Hotel has an amazing rooftop terrace and a small pool. It was the only one of the three with a pool, so it made a huge difference in entertainment/relaxing environment/and wow factor. There was a lot of staff and the lobby is amazing. The;5
I had to stay in the city on 1/5/18 because of the storm and needed to be close to Wabc where I work. I had to walk over through crazy winds and frigid temperature and was welcomed by Patrick at the front desk. He was very helpful and made the ov,really experience easy and the room was perfect.;5
We always stay at this hotel when we visit ny once or twice a year.  Good service and very pleasant staff.;5
The staff at the hotel were some of the friendliest I've experienced.  I really wanted to get a swim in before I flew -- and they helped make sure I could access the pool in time so I could make my flight AND get in my workout!;5
I needed a place close to the Hollywood Bowl and Universal City and the Hilton is perfect. Just down at the bottom of the hill is the Subway so you can get around Hollywood and Los Angeles and not worry about traffic.;5
"I have just returned from a 5-day stay in Astor on the Park.  I had booked the hotel before reading the reviews on here and when I did, I actually thought about cancelling. Thankfully I didn't.  I could not fault this hotel, nor could my three friends. It was ideal in everyway.  Four girls on a shopping Trip to New York, we stayed in a two double bed room (room 601) - Yes it was small, but that was the only issue with the room and besides, we only planned to sleep there!!   The room had two double beds, which were extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was perfect; shower/bath/toilet/washbasin/hairdryer, fresh towels everyday and little shampoo/body wash bottles.  An Iron is available on request and they left it with us for the duration of our stay.  We got a room at the back of";5
This year was a bit more pleasant on check-in and waiting time except the room was not ready at 3PM.  Waited 1/1/2 hours to access it.  Otherwise love the Tick-Tock dinner and the Italian restaurant in-house.  Room was clean and comfortable as well as quiet.  They did have elevator problems with long waits, but a letter of apology was distributed. Also the revolving door was not working for the majority of time I was there.  There was extra staff working the manual doors that helped the situation--this also provided extra eyes for security.;5
Loved this little hotel, it was in a great location, for walking, catching public transport, shopping. The reception staff were always friendly and helpful.The room was really big, had two double beds, and the beds were really comfortable to sleep on. The only thing which was disappointing was there was no kettle in the room to take a cup of tea( you no us English love our tea) so had to go down to starbucks to get a tea in the morning. But apart from that little thing, every thing was lovely;5
Our room and bathroom were tiny, but comfortable and clean. Perfect location for all we wanted to do. Very good value. The Tick Tock Diner in the lobby is a real plus! Friendly and helpful staff. Would not hesitate to stay at the New Yorker Hotel again.;5
The best hotel in New York. Central location close to all attractions transport and restaurants. Had a suite this time it was amazing. No beverage facilities in the room which would be appreciated especially in the mornings and on arrival after international flights. That said no problem using a travel kettle. Coffee shop straight facing hotel.   Love everything about this hotel.;5
Great location just minutes from Central Park and easy access to subway to get all over New York Lovely. looking hotel inside and out and pool was a welcome addition Would definitely recommend to anyone;5
Great service and great location!  Every employee we encountered was very friendly and professional. The rooms are small, but that was expected.  Looked exactly like the picture on the internet, so there were no surprises.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker the last two days. Neida specifically at the front desk went above and beyond to help us with coordinating checkout with events we had going on. They also were amazing during the check in process. The whole staff did an amazing job keeping a large number of people safe. It is a gorgeous hotel! Definitely old hotel feel but gorgeous! Views from the upper floors are amazing!;5
We were going to book a hotel and opted to stay here instead as money was a bit tight, I am so glad we did. I must admit I had reservations as it's a hostel I had never stayed in one before. The staff were helpful and the whole building was very clean and fresh, the shared bathrooms were very clean, Our room was very clean with nice decor I loved having a fridge in our room and I would definitely stay here again.;5
Most people stay here for Universal Studiosâ¦but I stay here because I can almost always get a competitive rate, and it is very close to business I do in Hollywood/West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.  Safety, cleanliness, and familiarity are concerns for me that this Hilton provides.  The close-by City Walk is a convenient and wonderful place to spend my downtime.;5
We spent a night between flights here, in a room with airport views. Our toddler loved watching the planes land and take off. Hotel is a short free shuttle bus ride from LAX, check in was quick and easy.  Lobby was fairly new, with modern decor and an open layout. I had a chance to catch up with a few friends at the hotel bar/restaurant, drinks and service were good.  The room itself was clean, modern, and quiet, with multiple paned windows. The room decor resembled some of the more modern Andaz and Park Hyatt places we've stayed, with mid-century modern furniture, tables, mirrors etc, which was a great touch. I also had the chance to use the business center on the 2nd floor, which was sufficient. Location of the property is obviously a quick ride to your terminal, but also;5
We checked in on 9/29 til 10/1 received a room on the 18th Floor.  Had two Queen sized beds as requested.  It was a great room.  The View looked out over the front of the hotel probably would have paid more a view out the back but really wasn't necessary as we were exhausted every night.  The Concierge at the hotel was very helpful the first day steering us to a good tour.  I was thinking the hop on hop off bus but since it was later in the day she said we would get stuck in tons of traffic.  We instead took a StarTour MiniVan tour and it was GREAT!!! Hotel is only a short walk back and forth from Universal and City Walk and if you're too tired you can get the shuttle which we also did.  Very nice hotel!;5
This was my first visit to Marrakesh and I am so glad that we had the Riad Kheirredine as our base. The staff on arrival were so welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. The Riad Kheirredine was spotless and the room was also impeccable, the staff seemed to come in every time we went out to straighten out the room. The offer of a phone and so we didnât get lost a employee to guide us to and from the Riad to the souks was very helpful when we got lost.   Offering to wash dry and iron our clothes for no extra cost was a nice touch.   I would highly recommend this as a place to stay for your trip to Marrakesh the breakfast was excellent, the spa / hammam also excellent and all the staff excellent, treated us more like friends than guests to there Riad.   Big thanks to Elena and;5
Interesting decor of lobby carried through to very comfortable room.  Everything was spotless, the staff very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely stay at the Empire again and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  I suffered an injury on my vacation (nothing to do with the hotel) and the Empire was able to provide a wheelchair and the security staff went above and beyond in assisting me.  I could not have asked for more in any facet of the experience.;5
Ivan and the entire staff made my visit so wonderful! They could not possibly have done a better job of helping me find my way around. I definitely recommend Hollywood Hotel for anyone who wants to enjoy themselves in a lovely location.;5
I give a five to the memory of this great, great option in Manhattan.   Nowadays, because all the business confusion created by the success of  AirbnÂ´b and similar professional websites offering unprofessional host options everywhere you want to pay something but service, Hotel Chains got a new law and in this situation, we all lost this option to get a percet place at the best price. It was nice while it lasted. We will forgive all the small lacks of service and we will always love you...;5
My stay at Hyatt Regency LAX was magical! The staff was friendly and helpful. The coffee bar in the lobby had delicious coffee and snacks and staff members that greeted you with a smile every morning. The rooms were beautiful and very clean. They were also so quiet, you would never believe this hotel was so close to the airport - I never heard any noise from the planes. The whole stay was very peaceful and quiet. The beds were comfortable and the housekeeping service throughout the stay was top notch! This is a great property to stay at with a central location to everything you could want to do in Los Angeles!;5
staff were very helpful when my booking I had made on hotel.com could not be found. They just looked at my paper work that I had brought and booked me in. $25 for early check in but worth it after a long flight. Room was great/huge. Meals also great and service from all staff excellent. Very short walk to universal studios.;5
The point iâve most liked in the entire hotel is the Chef Hugo, he is amazing! A perfect breakfast and he speak 10 languages. An excellent person and professional! Congratulations Hugo, amazing! Really!;5
This is the closest hotel to LAX (you can actually walk across Sepulveda bloulevard to the airport if you want). Wonderful service and great room and amenities. The hotel is very welcoming and clean. The fitness center is great with a view of the runways and the pool area is really nice too. Fast elevators (my room was on the 11th floor with a view of the north runways). The room itself (mine was a King room) was great, nice couch and great TV the shower and bathroom were great too. Would definitely stay here again!;5
The hotel is in a great location so close to all the attractions and it was fantastic for all my family. It was the first time for my children in London and they loved it. We had dinner in the restaurant every evening and the service was great. Our room had been recently refurbished and it was a plus to an already wonderful stay at this hotel. I would recommend it to anyone going to London with their family!;5
Awesome location, just renovated, great product, friendly staff, and the food and beverage are top notch. I'm a loyal fan of Hyatt anyway and glad to have this hotel at LAX. This hotel is great for meetings, family overnights, a short or long term stay and they have an awesome fitness center.;5
I really like the service Nancy provided me at check- in. I was there for every short stay. There fore I  really didn't get to explore the area around the hotel, but I did have a good night. I would definitely stay here again.;5
We came in with my sister to celebrate her 70th birthday by attending the Billy Joel concert.  We were upgraded to a gigantic, clean double room on the 31st floor!  We didn't even have to ask.  Kudos to The New Yorker.  Right across the street from Madison Square Garden.;5
For at least ten years, our family has stayed at the New Yorker hotel when we visit from the Boston area. It is clean, comfortable, and full of fun Art Deco touches. The Tick Tock Diner next door is also excellent. We have recommended it to many many people.;5
After making a reservation here, I read other trip advisor reviews and became concerned, I think the difference in the reviews is  whether or not you get a renovated room .  Definitely ask for one .  The room was small but well furnished  as was the bathroom,  location was central  and staff was very helpful.;5
The newly remodeled rooms are very comfortable and clean for the most part. I love the shower heads and linens. The downstairs bar/restaurant was a fantastic place to watch the Rams game and enjoy drinks and dinner. All of the staff are professional and responsive.;5
Landed from overseas fight and needed somewhere close to LAX for onward journey and this was perfect.   Shuttle runs from the hotel and is easy to access both to and from the hotel. Pleasant, clean with friendly and professional staff.  We were also picked up from the hotel for a day trip - so added bonus.;5
Without the attentive Wafa and Valentina, the ever-helpful Khaleid and Abdou and the tour-de-force that is Ismael this riad would loose almost all its charm. They are the engine that will make your stay in Riad Kheirredine run smoothly and so much more enjoyable. There were numerous occasions when they went beyond the call of duty to help us out. A big thank you to all of them.   The riad has a very good system of providing the guests with local mobile phones during their stay so that you can call the riad anytime/anywhere if you're lost or need anything when wondering through the dizzing souk alleyways of the 'old town'...trust me...it's extremely easy to get lost. Once you call them, they'll be there in a matter of minutes (either by foot or by moped) to help you...now that's;5
Everything about the stay was great - the service, surroundings, rooms, food. The hotel even had a few pleasant surprises, such as free cell phones to guide through town and call the hotel or restaurants as needed, as well as hotel staff to walk you to the main spots in the Medina. I can't think of a single thing that could have made the stay better!;5
The hotel was amazing. The location wad great. The Roof top party was great. Overall it was a great experience. The food was also great l. The drinks are a little on the expensive side but I guess that's something they have to work on.;5
Loved staying at Hyatt,the overall experience was great:) the staff at check in was very helpful the rooms were very clean and well equipped:) the restaurant UnityLa was awesome both dinner and breakfast were amazing :) people working there are super friendly and awesome ð;5
"This is my go-to hotel in the City. You can't get better value for money in Midtown Manhattan than at the New Yorker, in my opinion, and I've always felt welcomed and right at home. Staff are all professional and kind; the establishment has an environmentally-friendly approach, rooms are very, very clean, comfortable and well-appointed, requests are handled promptly and cheerfully; the security and concierge staff are discreet, courteous, helpful and reassuring, and that sumptuous lobby is a must-see! This celebrated Art Deco property has a history that adds to the visit. If you want a room with a ""view"", you can ask for one; but even when I haven't asked, I've always enjoyed the views. As everywhere in NYC, rates do vary quite a lot depending on the day of your stay and peak";5
"This was the second time we'd stayed here - the last time being 5 years ago.   Staff are professional and efficient and the rooms are perfect (if a little smaller than some) for a family of four. We had a corner room, high up, on both occasions with a great view of the 101 and surrounding hills. Experience told us that the hotel is the perfect base for many places - Universal Theme park being the main one, as well as City Walk in the evening.  The pool area is great for sunbathing while the kids play in the water and drinks and refreshments can be orddered via room service.  The ""usual"" Hollywood places are only a short drive or taxi ride away, so it's a pefect base.  Food and Beverage services are A+ : not least being the Breakfast Buffet. Probably the priciest on our vacation,";5
Martin made our dinner beyond special!! Came here with my mom and sister and he went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. So sweet and such a nice guy! Thank you, Martin. Weâll dine here again because of you.;5
I have stayed in other hotels for the Westminster dog show, but this was by far the best. Dog friendly, responsive staff, conveniently located to all our show venues, clean, comfortable, reasonable rates, and friendly.  Will go back!;5
Great value for money, the room was large and clean, the staff were very friendly and very helpful. Iâve stayed in a couple of different hotels in NYC and this was by far the best. Could not recommend this hotel enough.;5
Great room, location and service! There was such an elegant  ambience with very unique furnishings. Staff was very friendly and courteous. Would definitely return...Loved the rooftop bar... enjoyed spectacular views with great cocktails;5
"This was our second stay at the New Yorker and I'm sure it will be out ""go to"" hotel next time we are in NYC. The last time we stayed here we had a disappointing experience with the type of room we were given (too small for two of us and luggage even though it was an upgrade), When we checked in this time I expressed that we needed enough space for two people and four day's worth of luggage and we were offered an executive suite that was much larger for a small additional fee and we were very pleased with it. The staff was really great at check-in, the doormen were helpful in advising about self-parking, directions, transportation, use of the concierge desk, and we used the bellhop twice. While this is a luxury hotel, I don't think that its price was out of line with other New";5
it was a great hotel we loved it such a great atmosphere the workers were amazing and kept a great attitude at all times it is a great luxury hotel. and it is very near the empire state building yurrrrr.;5
We spent 5 nights and had a great stay especially with the friendly help and assistance from Pil, Ali and Beatriz Thanks guys. The hotel is extremely comfortable, clean and relaxing with great facilities. Every morning at breakfast Hugo would greet us with a warm smile and make us the best omlete ever. A great start to the day.  Thanks heaps Hugo.;5
Where do you start, from the minute we walked into this hotel until the day we left, everything was fantastic. The staff were some of the friendliest I have ever met on any of my travels, the rooms were a great size with excellent rviews and fantastic facilities. The pool area was very well maintained and clean and a pleasure to spend time in.   What we found very good was it's somewhat central location. Close to Universal studios, and Warner Bros, a quick trip from Hollywood, and the majority of tours pick up from the hotel. Bear in mind if you intend on spending time at Disneyland its about a 45 minute trip. We actually checked into a hotel in Disneyland for the two days w were their instead of travelling.  Overall the Universal Hilton is a fantastic place to stay and I have;5
This place is very good in all categories.  Secure parking area. Great location only a few miles each way to all attractions. Unbelievable breakfast from 6.30 till 10.30. Breakfast was included in fare. Price was more than reasonable although it was discounted. Reception staff were above average and went out of their way to assist. Rooms were clean and large with all the mod cons. Large screen TV with all the satellite channels. I whole heartedly recommend this hotel.;5
Weâve stayed at this same hotel 4 times on our way to Hawaii, and it has not disappointed.  Canât get any close to airport. Shuttles to hotel pretty frequent.  Bar area and service very nice, and large heated pool.  Would return again!;5
This is conveniently located close to 96 subway and walking distance from several great restaurants and bars. There is a wine shop and super market not far away. It is also walking distance from Whole Food market and TJ Max. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are small, but always clean.  There is a lot of traffic always in the lobby. But overall I had a very pleasant quiet room and was able to rest well.  Very convenient hotel for business travelers and people on vacation.;5
Fantastic stay at this hotel. Experienced staff, room was clean and had all the features to get work done. Easy access to and from the airport (only a 10 minute walk!) Despite being close to the airport, the hotel is quiet. The room had many green features. Unlike other hotel rooms, the air conditioning was easy to set to perfect.;5
For our first visit to Morocco and Marrakech, I had been advised by friends to stay at a Riad within the old town to really experience the city.  Booked Riad Kheirredine based on reviews and so pleased I did.  This place is tranquility within the cultural chaos that are the streets and souks of the old town.  The noise and dust disappearing the moment you step inside. The staff are so welcoming and suggested trips, organised the airport transfer (which is essential to find your way here).  Everybody was genuine and helpful, suggesting and offering opinions on where to visit to have the best weekend.  Amazing value for money and the food is stunning.  Even had a birthday cake surprise on my first night.  Would highly recommend.;5
My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The hotel was clean, new, and in a great location right in the heart of NY, a few blocks from Times Square and Central Park and close to several subway stops. The staff at the hotel were so helpful, always giving great recommendations for day and night activities. We loved our 4 night stay in NY and can't wait to return again. We especially enjoyed speaking with the bell boy (which I unfortunately I can't remember his name) who was always so welcoming and full of tips. Looking forward to staying here again. I Highly recommend it if you're looking for a central, clean and reasonably priced hotel!;5
As 2 girls in Morocco for a week we booked for 2 nights at Riad Kheirredine and loved it so much that we ended up staying for 4!  By the end of our trip we felt like we had made friends with the staff as well as had our every need met.   They went above and beyond the call of duty and you really felt like they enjoyed making your stay as wonderful as possible.  The team organised a guide to take us around the city and souks, a massage at the Riad which was great, bus tickets, countless taxis, great recommendations for bars and restaurants and made reservations for us.  We were provided with a mobile phone in case we ever got lost and told to call any time day or night if we needed anything,  if we got back late at night we were asked to call the night guard who would meet us and;5
We stayed for a 3 night break for an anniversary trip, this last weekend.  I am a travel agent, so probably the worst when booking my own breaks... it took a long time to choose this hotel, we didn't want a standard chain hotel, but one that was typical New York, good location and had a bit of history attached.  This hotel ticked all the boxes.  Check in and lobby area was really busy, however the ladies behind the desk were really quick to work the queue, so we didn't wait too long anyway.  Our room wasn't quite ready for us immediately, but that was fine as we left our cases and headed out for a bite to eat.  It was worth the wait, we were really lucky to be upgraded to a suite, room 3809.  We had our own lounge, sink area with fridge and drink machine, room with a queen bed;5
We had a fantastic weekend break in this ideally located hotel. The staff was fantastic and always enthusiastic and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel because of its ideal location, friendly helpful staff and great value.;5
Hotel was perfectly situated near Times Square, 5th avenue, Rock Center and many other walk able destinations. From check-in, the staff was very friendly.  When we got to our room, we experienced an issue with the heater in our room. They were quick to resolve the issue by moving us to a larger room free of charge and even offered a slight discount for the inconvenience!  When leaving, Jeff was more than helpful to load our car and watch over the luggage while i walked to a nearby garage to get the car. Would highly recommend!;5
This is a splendid place to stay. It is the first time I had been there since the remodel and I didn't recognize it (this is positive). The staff, service and amenities are wonderful. We held a small business conference there and everything went great. I highly resommend this place.;5
"There is a Salvadoran employee named Juan who was very kind and helped me locate some addresses. Also Sonia, Hugo and Ana made the experience better; they were really helpful. Food is great and the hotel is well located.";5
My friend and I have just returned from an excellent stay at the Empire Hotel. When we arrived we were able to check in straight away and hassle free. We requested an upgrade to a twin room as there would be more room and a bed each. The lady at the front desk upgraded us with no trouble and even gave us the wi-fi access code for our stay which meant we could easily keep in contact with family back home. All the staff at the Empire were extremely helpful and friendly. The concierge, Chris, was able to give us all the information about which shows to see and how to get the cheapest tickets which was most helpful. In the end we decided to see Chicago- a must see!!!   Our room was a twin room, with two queen sized beds. Now I am glad I requested that upgrade because I cannot;5
Recently, stayed four days at this hotel:  very pleasant and accommodating staff (no exceptions).  Every staff member I encountered was very friendly and helpful. Although my stay was unconnected to the theme park, the free shuttle to City Walk, et. al., is quite convenient and runs continuously.  Arrived at 9am on the morning of USA's match and the bar TVs were on and wait service made available even though the bar would not officially open for a couple of hours.  Also, my request to check-in early (noon) was quickly granted.  My room was spacious and the bed quite comfortable.  I highly recommend this Hotel.;5
This hotel was a great location near LAX. The free 15 min shuttle bus was convenient. Room services was tasty and quick didnât have to wait for long. The pool was well heated and the gym cosy with very good equipment. And the restaurant was excellent with good customer service. Would recommend to anyone needing a quick stay near the airport. All services were booked to the room. Canât recommend hotel enough.;5
Hilton never lets us down and this hotel was not an exception to that.  Stayed for 3 days and 2 nights as part of our family LA/Hollywood vacation.  We had a wonderful stay at this hotel and our expectations were well met.  The location is so convenient to Universal Studios Hollywood...its probably about a 15 min walking distance or about a 5 min shuttle ride.  Our room faced Universal Studios and gave wonderful views of it day and night as well as a great view of the hills and nearby Burbank.  We had a standard room that actually provided ample room, so it did not seem crowded.  We had 2 double beds that were very comfortable with high thread count sheets and fluffy down pillows for luxurious sleeping.  The entire room was very clean and pleasant.  There was even a;5
What a wonderful surprise to find this gem of a hotel located right across the street from Lincoln Center!  My suite was absolutely lovely and the staff could not have done more for me.  The bar was great!  Room service was prompt but the food was mediocre and that is the only thing that was not totally perfect about my stay.  I highly recommend this hotel to the most discriminating traveler.  Recently completely renovated and in one of the most convenient spots in Manhattan, it offers a flawless experience.;5
Had a brilliant time in New York. The Ameritania Hotel was fantastic, great location & the staff where lovely. Would especially like to mention Jalal on the door who always greeted us & organised our return shuttle to the airport and Wendy the maid.;5
Stayed 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were all friendly, polite and professional. The room suited our needs being clean, a good shower and a comfy chair. The location was exactly as required. Breakfast was available for a reasonable cost, however we needed to be out early so did not take advantage of the breakfast. Certainly recommend. Bonus was being able to store your luggage after checking out!;5
We arrived after a long trip from the UK into the Wyndham New Yorker. Check in was fast. The receptionist took our passports and realised it was my partners 40th birthday while staying at the hotel. They upgraded us to a city view (very nice touch) we were amazed. We went up to our room on the 36th floor, pulled the curtains open and WOW! The Empire State Building was right in front of us. It was amazing! We could also see Maddison Square Garden.  The rooms are kept clean at all times. We speak more time in ours room than we would of liked due to New York doing into lock down due to Covid-19. The decor is art decor and in places, looks amazing, but in some parts, needs updating and looking after.  We ate in ten Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel a couple of times. The food;5
I stayed at the hotel over the weekend of March 11-13-20111.I had some issues with my room that I was not happy with, but when I went to the front desk I was greeted by two hotel employees  leda and adriana who were amazingly helpful in solving my issues they really made my stay there amazing they were so quick to fix the issue i cant thank them enough ... and I cant wait to come baack...;5
Lovely riad with 1st class service! Fantastic but unobtrusive service nothing was too much trouble! We only stayed 2 nights but were treated like kings with transfers, day trips and even chargers and toothpastes taken care of when we asked them!   Homemade lemonade and any drinks you wanted provided which was a must after long days in marrakech. The pool was beautiful and the rooftop terrace was something out if a dream. I would recommended this hotel to anyone!;5
A hotel stay is only as good as how the staff make you feel and this hotel has fantastic staff. My kids and I received a genuinely warm welcome when we arrived and a lovely farewell when we left. We were in a very clean and comfortable room and I was happy at how nice all of the staff members were. Really close to LAX and the free shuttle runs every 10 minutes with no booking required. Very enjoyable.;5
Great location, close to London Eye. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was great value for money. Good breakfast. Room was clean, quiet and comfortable. Fantastic stay, would recommend and will definitely be back.;5
Beautiful and friendly atmosphere and it truly felt like a get away from heaven! The roof top lounge was amazing, drinks were delicious and my girlfriend and I had totally complete silence, which is the main thing we were looking for;5
My husband and I had a great time at this hotel. The room was spacious and inviting, clean and modern. The lobby was pretty and the staff were helpful and friendly. The top deck with a pool was great. And the location was perfect for us. Would absolutely recommend this hotel to friends and family. The location right next to Central Park was the reason why we chose this hotel, and we are very happy with the choice.;5
Came in for a show at the Greek, for the price, amenities and closeness to the show we booked for 1 night it was the RIGHT CHOICE. The hotel is wonderful and the rooms are so quiet. At check in we met the famous Pil and to be honest he does live up to all his reviews. He set us up in room 129 and it was like a heavenly cave. After the show we slept like babies in our room.   Then to our next surprise THE BREAKFAST OMG it is to die for. Freshly made omelets and waffles. Coffee (which was much needed ) fresh and HOT. After a full belly we walked up to reception and Pil was still there.   We loved it so much we booked another night. Needless to say we recommend this hotel highly and will make it our go to for all our stay in Hollywood.;5
My family and I came to visit NYC from North Carolina and have read such good things about the Empire hotel, so we had to give it a shot. When we arrived to the hotel we were greeted at the door by the friendly bellmen staff at registration, check in was quick and easy.Â Can't beat the location, right next to lincoln center and walking distance from columbus circle. plenty of restaurants and shops around the hotel. Rooms are standard new york city size, very clean, housekeeping staff was very nice. Service was great, lyla at the front desk was so nice and helpful. also eugene the bellmen and yuri helped us during our stay. Thank you everyone! we hope to be back again soon!;5
Drinks and amazing and staff is so friendly! Michael the manager was great!! I'm a southerner and the hospitality was great and the drinks were even better. The lobby bar is a blast The bartender Santiago is AMAZING!! So nice and makes the most delicious drinks!;5
Once in hotel everything worked out well. The front desk was above average in accommodating us. Their free breakfast has a chef that makes omelettes and waffles. Located near an urgent care in case you need to check on your well being, it is quite convenient.;5
Canât beat the location for a visit to Universal Studios.  Check in was quick and easy and we were able to check in early.  Parking was plentiful.  Food options were varied.  Room had a great view.  Everything about this resort hotel was awesome.  Yes, it is a resort so plan on things costing a little more but you also get a little more.;5
Conveniently located near Penn Station, I will definitely stay here again. The decor was cool and it fit with the history of the building. I enjoyed the sense of security by having to show my room key before boarding the elevator.;5
The room is spacious and clean. Stayed here a couple of times. Staff is friendly and breakfast is included and great! Hugo is preparing your eggs and waffles the way you like. Swimmingpool looked good but didn't had the chance to use it.  Would not recommend walking to hollywood boulevard. Just take an uber or the subway.   Parking isn't included and expensive like every hotel in LA. Unfortunately a lot of taxes and extra costs were added to our bill what made it a lot more than expected.  Overal, expensive but a great hotel.;5
From the time we arrived to the last minute of our stay, we were treated with the utmost care. Every member of the staff is extremely kind and helpful. The Riad is very clean and comfortable and we particularly enjoyed having breakfast on the panoramic terrace, but the real plus about this Riad is the excellent service.;5
Stayed overnight at LAX Hyatt during CA Covid restrictions. It was difficult to find a vacant table out of six tables total in the bar area. Thankfully bartender Trino Barba in the Lounge Bar assisted us. Much thanks to him. Employees such as Trino is why I have stayed at Hyatt hotels for over 30 years. The Covid restrictions significantly impact hotels in Los Angeles County. Be aware when booking your room. Otherwise this Hyatt is as clean and orderly as it has always been. My stays have only been an overnight due to LAX flight schedules. Shuttle operates between the hotel and LAX every 15 mins 24x7.;5
We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the New Yorker. We had booked the trip for a concert at Madison Square Gard and have to say this was perfect as it was just a few steps away. Had a great corner room and loved the  beautiful view of the city.  The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Room was a nice size by New York City standards. Would have liked a little more room in the bathroom but I guess you canât have it all. All in all it was a great trip and we would definitely stay here again. Thank you.;5
This is a centrally located hotel very close to the music centre of NewYork close to Columbus Circle. The rooms are quite large, beds are comfortable and for the price this hotel is a bargain.  The staff will do their best to accommodate your requests and a big thanks to Anthony on the front desk for his assistance.  Highly recommended hotel.;5
This hotel is within walking distance of Universal Studios/Citywalk.  Also only 1 tube stop from Hollywood Boulevard (walk of fame & chinese theatre).  The hop on/off bus connects from the hotel to other bus routes.  Would definately stay there again.;5
We loved staying at the Empire   while in New York because of its great location and amiable staff. Many thanks to Rickie at the front desk and the rest of staff for making our stay a pleasurable one. The lobby bar ambiance  is an added plus when receiving friends and family.  Mr. And Mrs. Pelaez Coral Gables, Fl.;5
I stayed for 3 night with my boyfriend. Clean, great location, very good breakfast buffet and friendly staff. Specially Pil who helped us to get a nice rate in our not planned third night. I totally recommend this hotel.  Limpio, ubicaciÃ³n excelente, muy buen desayuno buffet y personal muy amable. Especialmente Pil quien nos ayudÃ³ a conseguir una buena tarifa en la tercera noche que no tenÃ­amos planeada. Recomiendo totalmente el hotel.;5
If you donât mind small rooms, bunk beds, and community bathrooms this former sailors boarding home is the perfect place to stay for less money than other NYC hotels. The roof top bar overlooks the Hudson and our stay there was fabulous. From the Hotel we were within walking distance to a lot of cool places and the subway. If you are into walking or running for fitness, the path along the Hudson is right outside the door. We highly recommend staying here.;5
I spent 3 wonderful nights here during my first trip to New York and found this hotel to be centrally located to all I wanted to do and see. My room was very comfortable with a beautiful view and excellent air conditioning. The staff are all friendly, helpful, and very professional. I had no issues with noise, and the bed was perfect.;5
I booked our Anni-Moon vacation package through Universal Studios Hollywood and we chose Hilton because it was just easier to go to Universal studios and City Walk . Upon our arrival, I called ahead to make sure we could check in prior to 3 pm and if we could have a high floor.  We arrived at the hotel before 12pm and we had a smooth check in.  Our room was on the 18th floor and which overlooked overlooked Universal Studios and the highway.  In addition, the floor we were on was quiet which was a plus. Our room was clean and smelled clean and the air-conditioner worked with no issues.The hotel staff was very pleasant and service staff in the cafe was exceptional. We used the free shuttle service that took us to and from Universal studios and City Walk.  Also, we used room;5
Recently stayed overnight at the Hilton at Universal Studios in Los Angeles- valet parking was a nice start to the trip! The check-in process was streamlined and was pleasantly surprised to receive complimentary water for being a Hilton rewards member! Our room was on the 8th floor and had a good view of Los Angeles. The room was spacious and had 2 queen beds and a very large and well stocked bathroom. (I usually stay at Marriott Hotels and think this Hilton bathroom was much nicer than most Marriott bathrooms I have recently seen!) We ordered room service and I was pleased with the gluten free pizza that they served me, and had a great sleep in the very comfortable bed! There was no noise to be heard in the hallways and the wake-up call was right on time! No complaints!;5
We loved our stay at The New Yorker! AWESOME customer service! It was incredibly convenient to Penn Station/Amtrak/LIRR, the art deco was beautiful, the Tik Tok diner is connected to the hotel and was excellent, the room was large, quiet and clean - we even had a view of the Hudson River (24th floor, try to get a high floor), the beds were comfortable, there's a CVS & Starbucks across the street, and of course, access to tons of shopping on 34th Street, close to Time's Square and the subway stop is right there.   Did I mention the customer service? Upon arrival at 11pm, the front desk clerk went out of his way outside the hotel to personally show me where the parking lot was (just across the street on 34th, between 7th & 8th). When we asked for a late check-out, they graciously;5
We had a great stay at The Jane, the hotel has so much history and the vintage decor is amazing!  The West Village location is ideal with so much in walking distance in Greenwich Village and nearby subway stations to the rest of the city. We stayed in a bunk bed cabin with shared bathrooms which was no trouble at all as the bathrooms are very clean and we only had to wait for the showers once and the hotel supplies you with bathrobes and slippers making you very comfortable. The room is indeed tiny but in NYC you only need it for sleeping and leaving your bags!  Our only regret is that we didn't spend enough time in the beautiful bar or go to the club on the Saturday night as we were always so exhausted when we returned from busy days running around New York! Also the avocado;5
I travelled with my teenage daughter on our 1st trip to New York.  Warm, friendly welcome from Maggie on check in.  Room small (not a concern as only used to sleep in), spotlessly clean with beautiful decor.  Comfy bed and pillows very welcome after a long days sightseeing. Only downside was that AC was noisy but not a major problem as it was needed! Concierge, doormen and house keeping staff all friendly, helpful& polite.  Roof top terrace beautiful.  Breakfast in Ed's Chowder House was amazing!  Highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return.  Claire Gibson, Northern Ireland.;5
"This Hotel was Great! The staff were friendly and well equipped Curt Horner was however exceptional; When in need of anything such as directions or help with your bags he was defiantly The Best to aid. We had such a wonderful time the rooms were clean and neat. We stayed in the Pent House with a Great View of the city. The subway station was 2 blocks away and only 2 stops to our destination of TImes Square. I love it and will Most Defiantly be staying here again!";5
My daughter and I came to LA specifically to go to Universal Studios.  We got to the hotel  before the check-in time, but since they had a room available, they checked us in with no problems.  All the staff that we encountered were friendly, and the facilities were clean.  There is a shuttle that comes every 20 minutes that will take guests to Universal Studios CityWalk.;5
LA was our first port of call on our international adventures in the USA and having stayed here about eight years ago I knew that this was a good place to stay. We checked in early as we had come off our flight from Melbourne and we were delighted to have a room that was ready for us.  We stayed in a double double room and it was clean and very well presented. Our package included a continental breakfast, but for $9 each we could upgrade to a full buffet, which is what we did. Buffet breakfast was brilliant. Lots of choices â juices, yoghurts, dairy, pastries, hot food items, individually boxed cereal and cold meats.  The location is one of the benefits of staying at Hilton Universal City! It is just a short walk to Universal Studios and Universal City Walk. If these attractions;5
The Jane is awesome, period. It is like staying at a high-quality hostel, without the feel of a hostel. The check-in is stylish and quick. The service is superb. The rooms are small, VERY small, but that is the POINT of this hotel, so to be expected. I stayed in a bunk bed room with one other person. Loved everything about it. Air conditioning made the room temperature great. Everything was clean. The location is really the best for people who want to be close to the subway and the meat-packing district where all the trendy spots have emerged in NYC. I will stay at the Jane again. Do not stay here if you are obese as the room will be too small for you. Expect to talk to other guests in the open areas like the shower/bathroom space.;5
This has to be one of the best hotels in LA, with accessibility and luxury. Very clean good parking good breakfast and the receptionist Pil was great he helped  me find restaurants, stores, and tourists locations.;5
My wife and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at Riad Kheirredine and can say without hesitation that it was the most incredible hotel stay we have ever experienced. We have travelled the world and stayed in some of the finest hotels but nothing compares with the warmth of feeling and level of hospitality that the team here give. From the moment we walked in we were immediately made to feel like one of the family and this level of exceptional service never dropped throughout the course of our stay. We arrived at around 10.30am, before our check-in time, but that did not matter. The team greeted us with smiles and immediately made us feel so welcome. We were guided to a beautiful serene space in the courtyard where they had set the table for us to have breakfast as we had;5
"The staff was very welcoming and accommodating; the facility outstanding!   The Riad was like an oasis in the middle of the old medina and was truly representative of Marrakech architecture and hospitality.";5
Very convenient if you are flying out the next day. Hotel was very clean and they had a complimentary shuttle to take you to airport. Hotel staff was very nice and answered all my questions immediately.;5
This was one of the best hotels ever stayed in. Room was comfortable and beautiful. Food was excellent. We were there 5 nights. Service was  warm and at a level Iâd not experienced but was not intrusive. All staff deserves a big hand. Roof terrace was lovely at breakfast and sunset. We will return.;5
This was first time staying at this Hyatt location. It's really close to the Airport and the Rental car locations. All of the staff were pleasant and made me feel welcomed. The Hotel was clean and the room was clean and spacious. The fish tacos from the bar were amazing! YUM!! And my egg white Omelet from the restaurant was delicious. The only downfall was the price for parking. The valet is $48 a day! Definitely didn't use them. And the garage parking is $31 a day. Over priced and too crowded! You can pay for in and out privileges in the garage, which makes sense if you're staying for more than one day. Overall, it was great and I would definitely stay there again.;5
The New Yorker is one of the grand old NYC hotels, but it prices its rooms at an affordable rate.  Right across from Penn Station, it works well for business travelers coming in by rail.  Once there, I've found staff to be courteous and prompt on check in and check out.  If you use the fitness room downstairs from the main lobby, you take a little history tour of great music broadcast from the hotel.  The lobby itself is always filled with people.  On other trips, when I had time after meetings were complete, the lobby proved a great place to be.  I could use internet and cell phone and despite the crowd, it worked to get business done.  It's much more pleasant than wiating in Penn Station itself.  It's a short walk to lots of good restaurangs, and the hotel itself boasts some;5
Beautiful hotel with a great location.  The staff is courteous and helpful without being intrusive.  The rooms were luxurious and clean.  The room service is top notch.  The menu was varied and adorable.  I loved my stay here.    I'll be back!;5
My Boyfriend and I were totally impressed with this centrally located Hotel.  The rooms offered all the conveniences of home ( mini fridge, microwave) and the casual elegance of hotels that I have stayed at in Barcelona and Switzerland.  Lovely decor, and patios that you can step out on overlooking a beautiful courtyard.  The complimentary breakfast was exceptional and a great way to start the day.  Kudos to the staff, the cooks at breakfast who fastidiously make you omeletes with fresh ingredients.  And be sure to look for Gisel Miller who gave exceptional personal service with a lovely smile no matter how absurd the question,and excellent directions around L.A.  (She knows her city!);5
Easy 5 minute walk to Universal Studios and Universal City (open area for shopping and eating).  Large hotel with a warm feel.  We had a corner room which was still tight for 4 (1 adult and 3 kids).  Pull out couch was well used so not so comfortable if kids are older.  Very large bathroom with sitting area was perfect for my 2 teenage girls.  3-4 night stay works out well with a 1-day pass at Universal.   Pool and hot tub were standard.  Very deep in the middle so harder for little kids to enjoy with limited supervision.  Parent would need to be in the water at all times.;5
This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. Love the Tick Tock restaurant with and good choice of reasonably priced food. The hotel is very well located to all points of interest. It is very well priced. Look forward to going back soon.;5
We had a large room with the most amazing view of the Empire State Building, which changed colour every night. Best to get a higher floor if you want views across the city. The staff were very helpful with directions, and ideas of what to do and the best way to get to places. Beautiful Art Deco style throughout.;5
Excellent stay and location! My daughter and I love this clean, convenient location when we atend an event at Feinsteins. The staff always goes beyond to help us out. Checking bags fior the day was extremely helpful!;5
Thanks to the personal service this road provides itâs a charming luxury stay close to the heart of the Marrakesh MÃ©dina. We enjoyed a four night stay having booked directly and received courtesy transfers in the price. We chose to dine twice at Moka the in-house restaurant, each time was an absolute delight as the chef produced delicious high class dishes (local and international) and even came out to greet us following the meal. You will find it difficult to navigate around the narrow passageways of the MÃ©dina but the hotel provide you a mobile phone with GPS and if you get lost you can ring them to have someone come and collect you!;5
My kids and I stayed here because of the close proximity to Madison Square Garden. The location was perfect! The staff was great and the room was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.;5
We stayed three nights at the Ameritania in September.  The price was very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area.  Our flight was delayed getting into NYC--instead of arriving at 6:00 pm, we arrived at 1 am.  We called the hotel from the airport about our late arrival and there were no issues checking in late.  Everything was ready when we arrived and the front desk even directed us to a great cafÃ© down the street for a quick bite.  The rooms are not large but they are clean and comfortable.  The walk-in shower in the bathroom was great.  As far as the staff, everyone was friendly and very helpful, especially Movrad who went out of his way to make sure we knew how to get to the subway, made sure we had taxi service when needed and was overall just very helpful.  This;5
The hotel is located next to the Universal Studio.  If you take the shuttle bus, it takes aroudn 3 minute ride.  The hotel is clean and the staff is nice and caring.  However, the internal decoration is still quite old fashioned, not up to date.  Since we spend most of time in the park, it does not really matter.;5
Perfect start to holiday. Comfortable and cleanliness all perfect. Staff helpful and happy. Location next to LAX ideal, very good transit to the terminal. Late arrival no problem, food available......;5
We got in much earlier than expected and they were very accommodating.  They gave us our room at 8:00am no extra charge!  When one person in our party forgot their broadway show ticket the front desk printed it for us in minutes.  The room and bathroom are tiny but we didn't care we weren't in the room except to sleep and shower.  The location is so convenient we could uber anywhere in the city and it never cost more than $20.  The only problem was we did not prepare for rain and they refused to loan us more than one umbrella so half of our party was drenched.  Otherwise a great place to stay.;5
After a cutting our very uncomfortable stay short at a nearby Inn, we stayed the Hollywood Hotel. I thoroughly recommend this delightful hotel. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, the room was very comfortable and refreshingly clean after the other place. We only paid a few dollars more than our first option, for this we had a great room, comfortable bed, fantastic breakfast the next morning and secure parking for the hire car. When we come back to LA we will most definately be staying here.;5
"Let me start by saying that I can't fairly rate the ""value"" of the hotel, since we used Hilton Honors point to pay for the stay.  (It was an excellent value in terms of points used per night.)  This hotel is conviently located to Universal and the City Walk area and has an efficient and reliable shuttle if you don't want to or can't make the relatively short walk.  The pool area is also nice.  While the overall hotel amenities are great, the friendliness and willingness of the staff to answer questions and address problems made the stay one of the best we have had in a hotel.    The only exception to the great staff service was the wait staff in the hotel lounge area.  While they were generally friendly, they were not very efficient in dealing with the customers at the tables.";5
Beautiful Riad with an incredible roof top view of Marrakech. The staff are extremely helpful. Fantastic stay. Fresh fruit is located all over the Riad. Breakfast was fit for a king. We also had an evening meal on the terrace watching the sun going down;5
right from the beginning when being greeted by the doormen the high level of service and personal attention was obvious.  It continued to the front desk when we arrived 2 hours before check in and the women helping us had our room made ready for us with a smile.  My children love the apples.  The location to central park, lincoln center, and museums is excellent.  The choice of casual and high end dining within a block of the hotel is second to none.  The decor and rooms are sharp, comfortable, and clean.  I highly recommend the empire;5
As a local who used to live in LA, I can say that the Hollywood Hotel is a great bargain for any tourist looking for a clean, affordable, and central place to stay in Los Angeles on their trip. It is close to the train and amenities such as a pharmacy and a bevy of restaurant. What makes it an even better hotel is its staff, particularly Cecile Eugenio and Nancy. For example, I stayed at the hotel between November 6-8 and in that time Nancy kindly granted me the room I requested, and, more importantly, Cecile went out of her way to send me my glasses which I had left at the hotel. She called me when they had found the glasses, and promptly sent it to me personally. This kind of attentiveness, I think, really makes this hotel stand out. This is coming from someone who travels;5
The visit to The Hollywood Hotel was last minute so I booked it on the way through a hotel website about 20 minutes before I got there. Once we arrived, our reservation wasn't in the system yet but we were already being treated like guest.  The men working at the front desk were Brian and Phil, the best guys ever and best front desk I've come in contact with and I'm at hotels twice a month. They let us put our stuff inside and park the car the  our room reservation was messed up and they were so helpful. They got us all settled in and were very professional but hilarious, I would come back just for them;5
We spent a Sunday night in order to visit Universal Studios. Our check in was easy and fast. The hotel is on a hill, above it all. Our room #2459 on the top floor had a stunning panoramic view of the foothills and city. The room was quiet and the bed comfy. Robes were waiting in the closet. We had the continental breakfast in the Sierra Room which was good with a nice selection of cheeses, smoked salmon and meats along with fresh fruit. It was an easy walk to Universal Studios and there is a shuttle provided. We will be back.;5
We stayed at the Riad for 3 nights at the start of July. As soon as we entered the Riad it was 5 star service. It was my 40th Birthday surprise and Elena and the team had gone out of their way to make it a very memorable birthday, I even got a cake for my birthday breakfast!  From start to finish everything we needed including taxis, restaurant bookings,camel riding (a must do) and guides were taken care of.  We stayed in an imperial suite and it was HUGE we had rose petals scattered throughout the suite and each day the maids stocked our room with water and left it sparkling clean. A big bonus for us was having the mobile phone the Riad provided, the medina is just a maze and having someone meet us via the mobile was a god send. All staff were just amazing but our biggest shout;5
Great hotel, clean good food and very helpful staff .But was particularly noticed nice and very helpful a staff Gisel Hernandez has our departure always helped until the last day we all stuff we .If back to Los Angeles then get this hotel and alone if only because the nice staff and Mrs. Hernandez which even has forwarded our mail bound for Germany.Thanks for the great service .5 stars from us;5
Our experience at the Ameritania was phenomenal! The people were extremely friendly and helpful! A special shout-out to Mikey, Majid, and Hassib! They made sure our stay was wonderful and went above and beyond! We especially appreciated the food suggestions in Koreatown! The hotel was very conveniently located and easy to get around the city. The room was clean and housekeeping made sure we had what we needed and that our room was clean. The doorman (who briefly lived in Minnesota) was very friendly and helpful as well and we really liked that we were able to store our luggage before and after check in so we could enjoy the city! If we make it back to NYC, we will definitely stay again!;5
My friend and I arrived for a 7 night stay. The receptionist Sophy was very lovely and checked us in. When we went up to our room, the bed was smaller than expected. If we had been staying for 3 nights we really wouldn't have minded, however we decided to bring this up to the staff. Jamole offered us a bigger room which was absolutely amazing! My friend was at one side of the bed and I may as well have been on fifth avenue! Before we got there my friend accidentally double booked and Patrick was very helpful with cancelling this. The hotel is located in such a great spot - so close to Central Park and a 20 minute walk to time square. The subways are nearby so it's only 2 stops there. Had an absolutely amazing time and can't wait to come back. Further thanks to the doormen who;5
This hotel made our wedding extremely memorable. It is so very difficult to find a location in Los Angeles that is affordable for a nice classic wedding. Downtown LA is waaay to loud. And everywhere else is way to far for our guests to enjoy. This Hotel is in the perfect location for our guests (we had a lot of friends and family from out of town who flew in). They have a metro station on both sides of the hotel, walking distance, that takes you straight to Universal Studios. It is surrounded by great cafes and sights and attractions. Our guests LOVED their stay here, the rooms are so clean, modern, and roomy. And the service was just outstanding.     Now, our wedding was unbelievable. Mandy took care of us 100%. We were kind of nervous since the prices were so affordable we;5
Firstly please book the airport transfer, this is the start of an exciting adventure! Your escort will be waiting at the airport to transfer you to the square in the Medina where you will be met by a guide from the Riad and a young man with a cart to carry your luggage, you will then be led through the alleyways to the Riad. The location is perfect, main attractions are all within walking distances and you are right in the middle of the medina.  On arrival you are so warmly welcomed by Valentina, who arranges mint tea and homemade pastries and delivers a brief overview of the Riad, the Medina and the unconditional support they are there to offer you should you require. Valentina provides you with a mobile with several contacts at the Riad should you get lost or indeed when you;5
Had a great time while staying at the Empire Hotel. The service was excellent all the staff was top notch especially Pascal who looked after our check-In. Pascal made us feel welcome and special also Maggie was so helpful in providing us with the information we needed to make our adventures exciting.  Both these employees are keeps and I will recommend this hotel to all my friends.   5 star  thanks again to all the staff for your professionalism thumbs up.;5
This hotel was beautiful and very conveniently located to the airport. We wrapped up a long day at the hotel bar with a cocktail and appetizers. The staff was great, the check-in was flawless. I highly recommend.;5
Great property for an early morning flight. Shuttle comes frequently, room was quiet, food good, check in speedy and the staff were very helpful. Nice gym if you wanted to work out, and the room was clean.   I would highly recommend this hotel.;5
We stayed for 13 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel in October 2016. This is an excellent hotel on 8th Avenue very close to all midtown attractions, Broadway shows, with subway connections just outside the hotel. Staff were excellent, security was first class and the room we had was great.;5
I had read reviews on the hotel before we travelled and was a bit nervous about staying here. I had nothing to worry about. The hotel is in a perfect location, right across from Madison Square Garden and next to Penn Station so you can get anywhere you need to. The hotel is slightly dated in the hallways but that is part of its charm. The room we stayed in 3255 wasnt too small at all. Had a small bathroom with bath and shower. The room also had a hairdryer which was a lifesaver as the power wasnt strong enough for mine. There was also an iron and an ironing board. There is no coffee or tea in the room but there is a diner downstairs and a starbucks across the road. The tick tock diner was also really good. Service was quick and food was really good. The staff in the hotel where;5
Only a 5 minute walk to universal. We stayed in a room with a great view overlooking universal studios. Room was also spacious for LA standards, Uses Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries and provides robes. Breakfast buffet was good with lots of options and restaurant servers especially Jovita were attentive. Our toddler loved the fish pond and turtles! Parking was convenient. They have shuttle to and from universal but didnât use this trip. Try their hydro massage chairs near the front desk!;5
"I stayed at the Riad for 4 nights with my 3 girlfriends. Even before we arrived all our requests for were taken care of promptly by team at the reception (shout out to Elena ) ! We were welcomed with warm smiles, hot breaks fast (even though it was way past breakfast hour ) and every other request was immediately met.   For our security and so we donât get lost the hotel staff would walk accompany us to the Medina and the night meet us at the car drop off spot to walk us back to the Riad (even at 4am in the morning ;) ! For that we were truly grateful !   They also arranged an authentic Moroccan dinner for us on our last night which was outstanding. The Tagine, pastille were simply delicious.    The degree of attention to detail , the genuine care for their guests left us in";5
The staff at this Riad is what made our stay so memorable and special. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and well looked after - there was no end of mint tea service, smiles and offers for help and advice on how best to enjoy Marrackech like a local.  We didn't have to think very much because everyone catered to all of our needs - we have not experienced such warm and friendly hospitality anywhere else in the world.  The Riad itself is beautifully appointed (we stayed in Poivre) and really appreciated the option to sleep in late and enjoy our very long and lazy breakfast on the roof terrace whenever it suited us.  We also booked the long stay option with the additional perks - the hammam spa was divine!;5
Fantastic hotel for location!! Central to almost everything - it's a 15-20 minute walk to Times Square and when you come out the hotel turn right, walk to the end of the street and look left you will see the Empire State Building! We arrived to the hotel after 11 hours of travelling, the receptionist was lovely and very helpful - gave us lots of information and let us check out late for a fee. We booked the New Yorker suite with 2 double beds and sofa bed for the 5 of us. The receptionist said she would send someone up to make the sofa bed which was fine with us. By the time we left the suitcases, went to get something to eat and came back up the bed still wasn't made. We found the linen in the closet and made it up ourselves which isn't ideal after travelling all that time, all;5
Will update further into my week long stay but first impressions: tasteful, comfortable, very clean, all amenities, good wifi, incredible location for theater and UWS.  Best is the staff: kudos to Minerva for a smiling, helpful, welcome brimming with professionalism and warmth. This far: I'm impressed and highly recommend.;5
I stay at the Empire when I come in to town for an annual conference. The staff is always friendly and helpful and they make checking in and out a breeze! This year my colleague arrived at the hotel several hours before her check in time and her room was already ready for her which was great after traveling all morning. While I did not eat at the hotel, I did drink at the bar and the bar tenders were extremely personable and fun to talk to. The rooms an facilities are always clean and tended to. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting the city!;5
We arrived at the Empire Hotel on our first holiday to NYC, we were amazed to find out we had been upgraded with free wifi in celebration of my boyfriends birthday 2 weeks ago!! Even more so to top off a brill first day we had champagne on ice to come back too. Thanks Pasquale your the best!! We will definitely be coming back to the Empire Hotel!;5
Its now my second time stay in a month and I have to say you get alot of value.  Locations, Very helpful front desk, good choice of foods.  Whenever I am visiting LA and need to stay near LAX, there isn't much better choices.  Oh and be sure to be a Hyatt member!  Or even better, credit card holder.  A lot of benefits.  LOVE  HYATT!!;5
The Empire hotel is newly renovated and still has all its lux and charm. Arrived at the Empire after a  hectic work day, turbulent plane ride and long trip from the airport. Was great to meet Maria at the front desk. She was amazing... pleasant, polite, poised and professional. She got me in my room within minutes. Once in the room all I could do was smile and say...yes!!!  Stayed in a deluxe double room which had the feel of a suite. Beautiful design, clean, comfortable and spacious. It even had separate AC/Heater units (1 unit by each bed) so no complaints, if someone likes it warm and another likes it cold.   Overall the hotel has a modern decor with a NYC vibe and attitude. Location is fantastic!  Make sure to check out the roof top lounge...the view is worth it. And order a;5
Friendly staff and lovely hotel in the heart of of the city, close to all shops and the empire state building also time square was a 10 min walk away. Would say the only down side was there was no drinks facilities in the room but seeing as there are shops everywhere around this was not a problem. We stayed fir 4 nights and iur room was always imaculat when we returned.;5
We were a party of three adults. We stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for six nights. It is so so central to everything a stroll to times square Penn Station or Maceys. The room was small but excellent. It is New York so you can expect smallish rooms. Air conditioning good. Shower and bathroom excellent. Security checks everyone before they reach the elevator so we felt very safe. We ate breakfast three mornings in the tick tock diner which we found great. We ate the other three mornings from the coffee shop in the lobby- coffee and danish as we were on the go we also found this excellent. Great hotel all round- my tip is to ask for room with view of Empire state Building on check in. We did and it was great to view it especially at night. We will definitely stay here the next;5
This Riad is the best thing that can happen to you when you look to stay in Marrakech and especially Medina for the first time. I bet that once you stayed there you would not want to go anywhere else. The place will grow on you! It is a wonderful oasis of calm to come back to after strolling through markets (souks) of the Medina. Our room (Lotus) was located on the first floor and was beautifully decorated with opulent Moroccan fabrics and accessories. It was very comfortable and quiet.   The best part of the Riad is the gorgeous terrace which has different levels and enough space to have some privacy if you like. They even have a small but  nice swimming pool on the roof! The boutique hotel offers all comforts you can imagine while also providing the personal service that is;5
It was wonderful....just researched on internet then went in a day before checking in to make sure and Lorena at front desk was unbelievable in helping me due I couldn't tour the rooms.  Ended up upgrading to a King Superior Room that was perfect.  Had a beautiful view of the city which we didn't really even need but everywhere we went in the hotel they treated us very professionally and very knowledgable and answered all our questions.  Staff at front door, lounge bar, rooftop bar....actually everywhere was top notch.  Walking distance to everything!!  Again, thank you Lorena....I know I came up several times and bothered you but you always had a smile and spent time with me to make sure I was taking care of my date!  I will be back!!;5
Best restaurant at an airport hotel like this one. Donât miss it. Especially the Drunken noodles. Creative menu and execution. Great restaurant service and food. Reasonable price. Still canât believe the best Asian fusion I had in So Cal was here.;5
This is the best hotel.  We arrived early on our arrival day to be greeted by Linda at the front desk.  She was more than helpful and actually arranged for an early check in for our two rooms.  Much appreciated after a 13hr flight with three children.  Beds are the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in.  Great location - close to Universal Studios , City Walk and the Metro into the city.  Best buffet I have ever seen.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to LA.;5
Stayed in NY. Ticked all the boxes, central ,very near the underground, many restuarants nearby and a lovely hotel.   No obvious downside, the air con was  a wee bit noisy. I have just written that and thought if you  rack your brains and the worst you can say is the air con was a wee bit noisy - Tells you all you need to know.;5
Stayed (1) night to attend a tradeshow at Javits Convention Center. It was a superb experience! I arrived at the hotel before 12:00pm, thinking I could use the bag drop until check-in at 4:00pm. To my surprise, the reception staff checked me into my room early so that I get to the show. The ladies I spoke with were both attentive and welcoming. As an older hotel, the decor and accents seem dated and tired to some. I think it adds an air of nostalgia to the days of old NYC. My room was clean and comfortable. That's what I really care about! I dined at Trattoria and Tick Tock. Great service, friendly staff, as well. It's located a few blocks from Empire State, Madison Square Garden, Macy's, etc.;5
To be honest I didn't know what to expect. When we arrived the Jeff and the other ladies behind the desk were super friendly and helpful. We had arrived to the hotel early but they kindly asked us if we wanted to check our bags and use the facilities before we ventured off into the city. The location was great. We were walking distance from Times Square and Central Park. Lots of restaurants and activity in the area. The room and bathroom were fun and stylish. We stayed on the 10th floor and didn't hear any street noise at all. Most importantly the bed was very comfortable. I was impressed with all we got for our money. We will be back for sure.;5
Had a great time...hot tub was the best...staff was wonderful.... Great with kids...restaurant was under renovation while we were ther so the was a little inconvenient...but the great buffets made up for the inconvenience. I was on a special diet while I was there and the chef met my needs.;5
I just wanted to send a note thanking you for the service and kindness of your team-John and Fernando. John helped me multiple times while I stayed at the New Yorker and went out of his way to take care of me. Fernando picked me up and dropped me off at the airport. He was friendly, safe and a huge help. I will stay at the New Yorker again just because of the service your team provided.;5
Very good place to stay, very close to Broadway, Times Square, and Central Park . Doormen Julian and Geoffrey, very helpful giving us information about where to go to eat and places to go, overall very pleasant place to stay , would recommend to anyone.;5
Arrival was very smooth, the lobby was quiet round 13:00 so check in was very fast and we had wonderful service from Mohammed who provided us a room on a high floor for city views and complimentary early check in as the room was available.   The room itself had everything we required although being a New York property it was small in size and very dated but the bed was very comfortable and we had a nice view across Manhattan.   We didn't use any of the hotel facilities but were aware there was a gym in the basement of the hotel.   The only downside is being charged the service fee for using the property that I don't agree with and to make things worse on top of this the hotel also charge $5 per item of luggage for storage until heading to the airport later that day, this is a;5
I had a very nice weekend in this hotel. Location, room and bedroom is perfect. Didn't use breakfast or dinner. If you visit New York you should have this Hotel, it's nearby Central Park when you like jogging and on the other side is Times Square nearby.;5
We found the staff very accommodating. The room was clean, comfortable and recently updated. We had a great nights sleep. The hotel is located in walking distance to Lincoln Center, Starbucks, great restaurants and a drugstore.;5
We were upgraded to room on 21st floor with awesome views of hills/mountains. Hotel was super clean and only 5 minute walk from universal. Shuttle also runs to the park every 20 minutes until around 9 pm.;5
Reception We paid to be collected from and back to the airport, this was quick and easy with no problems, where the taxi journey ends, the last leg to the Riad is with the luggage being pushed in a hand cart - all part of the charm of Marrakech. Upon arrival in the Riad we were met by Valentina who sat us down in the courtyard with tea and biscuits to tell us the rules! There aren't any: apart from Enjoy Yourself, anything you want, just ask! She gave us a mobile phone to use for the duration in case we got lost - more of that later!  Room We were then shown to our rooms which consisted of a bathroom with a shower, WC and sink and two fabulous towel  gowns, up a small flight of stairs to the lounge room, big double bed type lounging area with wardrobe space, up another flight of;5
If you want to be treated like royalty, this is the place to be! From the moment you walk through the door, you become a Riad family member. I usually like to call out staff for their expertise but here I can not choose who to mention. Everyone was fabulous! They give you a phone so you can contact them for anything you need while you are there. They have complimentary laundry and ironing. The rooms are cleaned twice a day. The hotel is spotless....not even dust in sight. It is sooo clean! The food is DELICIOUS! I normally like to venture out and have food outside of the hotel but I found myself coming back for lunch everyday because the food was so good! Need I say more? I highly recommend this Riad to everyone. I will surely return here on my next visit to Marrakech!;5
My friend and I went to New York for a concert. I had looked for several hotels within walking distance of the venue we were going to. Luis at the desk was very friendly and asked about the concert we were attending. He even went as far and looked up the name of the group we were going to see. Luis upgraded our room to 2 double beds instead of one queen for the same price. I was very impressed with the room and the size of it. When we came back from the concert he even took the time to ask how it was. Thank you Luis for making us feel cared for.;5
The shuttle was convenient and on-time.  The hotel is clean and has good amenities.  The food is what is expected - a bit overpriced and good but not great.  The room was quiet.  Overall, this was a good place to stay for a morning flight.  I was even able to walk to the hotel after dropping off a 1-way rental car.  We did a short stay so I can't comment on the pool or gym.  The staff was friendly.  I'm not sure what anyone else could expect from an airport hotel.;5
Thank you for a lovely stay. Hotel clean and well maintained. Excellently situated for central London, and sightseeing. Just a short walk from the Houses of Parliament. Staff very helpful and friendly. But I must give a special mention to Yasodara. A member of staff in the breakfast dining room. A very attentive and friendly member of staff. A really asset Iâm sure to the  Premier Inn, London County Hall team.;5
We have had a four-night stay at the wonderful Riad Kheirredine. Welcomed by a friendly and smiling staff setting the high standard of service for our stay. Greetings and care, good advices, and unforgettable breakfastes on the terrace overwieving the Atlas Mountains. A clean and luxury bathroom and a big and nice sleeping room. Comming home after shopping is like entering an oasis after a intens day of in the soukhs. Always offered something to drink from the friendly staff. All in all a memorable stay!;5
My husband and I stayed here between 13-17 October and we were so happy we did.  The location was fantastic, our room was 5 star (it was so big and plush) with stunning views and walking distance to city walk and Universal Studios.  Every night we would walk to city walk and have dinner in one of their restaurants and then walk back to the hotel.  The hop on hop off bus even comes to the door of the hotel I think every 30 mins and drops you right outside the Chinese Theatre and the metro is just a short walk down the road and one stop to the Walk of Fame.  This was our first time to LA and we loved every minute of it.  We would definitely be recommending the Hilton to friends and family.;5
Was tended to by Beatriz at the front desk, the most friendly and knowledgable front desk clerk I have dealt with. The hotel itself was super comfortable, and the included daily breakfast was super good as well. Great find!;5
I would like to thank staff at hotel they couldn't  have been any nicer and thank you for helping my daughter have a memorable 21st in New york. Our room had amazing view loved it every day and night time was spectacular.  Hotel was Beautiful  all staff were very helpful and accommodating.  Would definitely  go back and would recommend  .x Loved our coffee maker in morning and had fridge  with water and cola again thank you.;5
From the minute we drove up, all staff members were friendly, courteous and extremly helpful. We were upgraded to the 16th floor with the most beautiful view of the San Fernando Valley. Watched an amazing 'moon' set the next morning. This hotel was so convenient, the shuttle takes you right to Universal Studio and to the Metro if you want to see Hollywood and its attraction is only one stop away....The buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner is fantastic! Dont miss it!  I had gotten a cold and the staff were very accommodationg, getting me extra tea, and honey. The room was very spacious we had the corner Alcove, the bathroom was beautiful and the shower delightful. The only down side we felt being from New York, is the price for parking, and Internet service....come now...that was a;5
My 2 sons and I traveled to the USA for vacation. The Hollywood Hotel was completely amazing. The staff are so helpful. Pil treated us very friendly. Everything that the hotel offers is amazing. Breakfast, pool, sauna. Only thing we would have wanted was faster WiFi but not a problem at all. Recommend for a Hollywood trip.;5
Easy, no line checkin.  Room was nice and cold, middle finger to Gavin Newsome.  The main thing is that I was comfortable.  The shuttle driver was great, grabbed every bag and was an amazing driver.  Room rate was a bit pricey, but it is LAX.;5
Very clean and comfy hotel definitely going back felt like I was at home loved the heated pool swimming in a 50* degree weather with the warm water was so relaxing jacuzzi was great liked they close the pools tell late..;5
Our profile is that of early to late 30's husband and wife who live in LA at the beach, no children, professional lifestyle with disposable income to spend on nice trips.  We travel for both work and pleasure, have been to Europe/Asia/Central America and throughout the US extensively.  This is not our first rodeo.  My wife and I receive hotel specials via email every day and the Empire Hotel came across Jetsetter.  We both typically stay at Starwood, but this was a fantastic location for NYC:  a street off Central Park (as we both love to run in the mornings and walk the parks during the day), close to Lincoln Center/Columbus Circle (subway access, perfect)/across the park from the Met, AND most importantly, not in Times Square.  Location, amenities and price all checked off to;5
We stayed at County Hall, hotel was clean and comfortable, perfect location for our 3 day trip. We had one meal in evening which was very preasobanly priced and good. Breakfast on both mornings was fresh and topped up regular and plenty of choice even at 9.30am which I normally find not the case in most budget hotels with buffet breakfast. The breakfast areas were spotlessly clean. My only quibble was the bed was too high being 5ft 1 but one in I had a very good night sleep;5
This was our first visit to Marrakech and we loved our time there, but I would say that our stay in Riad Kheirredine was most definitely the highlight! Absolutely everything here is spot on...the rooms are lovely, food is delicious, the rooftop has glorious views and is a great spot to relax...oh and let's not forget the staff, they are all truly brilliant, so happy to help, super friendly and don't have a single bad word to say!! If you're going to Marrakech for a few days stay here!;5
A very sleek hotel. Modern touches and very clean as well. Great view overlooking LAX airport (aviation geek). Easy access to LAX as it is the closest hotel right on Century Blvd to the airport entrance. Shuttle service available, and also within walking distance. Only downside is cost of parking. $20 per night, or $44 dollars for in-out privileges.;5
Not only is the New Yorker a classic New York hotel, but it lives up to the billing. The staff are friendly and helpful, and one feels almost as though Frank Sinatra will step around the corner any minute. Itâs a classic feel with all the modern conveniences.;5
Iâve travelled a lot in my life, so it is no exaggeration when I say this is BY FAR one of the best hotels Iâve ever stayed in. Even before we arrived, they were so attentive, making sure we had a car to pick us up from the airport. Once we arrived, we were blown away by the amount of detail and attention they put into all their guests. Breakfast was always very delicious (a special thanks to Yassine for being such a great waiter), our room was always tidied up nicely, and all the staff were so incredibly welcoming and friendly. As two young women who were travelling, we were a bit nervous arriving in an unfamiliar country, but everyone at the hotel instantly made us feel safe and reassured. Suffice to say that I will 100% be back to Marrakech and back to Riad Kheirredine. Thank;5
We had an excellent few days in February.  Rooms excellent, we'd read in the reviews that the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and so they were.  Can't fault the hotel, prices very reasonable.  Would strongly recommend.;5
"A perfect delivery of service, comfort and care.  The staff was accommodating, genuine and above and beyond in making my stay a great experience.  My room was well appointed, spacious and quiet. Though there for business at a busy vacation resort; my stay there was a 9 out of 10.";5
We just checked in and have been really happy with our experience.  Mohammed at the front desk in particular was spectacular in helping us get checked in, and was super kind and caring despite the long lines - very professional and helpful.  Even called the room to check on us - WOW.  We are now enjoying our nice, clean room - so roomy compared to so many boutique hotels around here.  And beds seem really comfy, and good soundproofing.  We also visit the Tik Tok diner downstairs frequently (more than for just this stay) and the food is always fresh and good.  Thumbs up!;5
We only spent 3 nights at Riad Kheirreidine, but it felt like a dream. Their welcome was super nice, warm and personal, and also during our stay they always showed honest interest in us. The service was on point, all the stuff was extremely nice and polite and open for some jokes. We really felt super welcome!  Also the Riad lies directly in the medina, also not far away from the Yves Saint Laurent museum. If you want, you can get a guide from the Riad to bring you to certain points. This was a service that we really loved, because the medina can appear as a labyrinth first.   Anyway, we had a wonderful and unforgettable time there and will for sure come back someday!;5
I have been a big fan of the Jane since it opened in 2008 (I think). I have stayed here three times - once in March of 2009, Once in March of 2010 and I just got home from my second stay in July of 2011. What I was kind of peeved about is that the Jane no longer allows couples to split single rooms (and while this is annoying, its a great way to save money). My boyfriend and I stayed in a double bunk bed room. Each bunk had its own TV, and the room had an ipod dock. I was SUPER paranoid about bed bugs before we came, but a quick inspection upon arrival showed nothing. I cannot imagine that the Jane is turning a blind eye to the bed bug epidemic in New York, especially with all of the bed press they seem to be getting these days.   Our stay was very comfortable. Yes, the rooms;5
So it was my first time here at Hiltons Los Angeles/ Universal City. Looking at the menu there was a lot of pressure because so many things were listed!!! But when ever I asked Martin about anything he was so knowledgeable!! He was very sweet and nice to all 15 of us!!! Heâs the best ! When ever you come here and want to know anything Martin is the guy to go to!! The food he suggested me to get was AMAZING!!!;5
Stopped here after long flight.. shuttle picked us up seconds after arriving at hotel pickup area, beautiful hotel clean comfortable good food and pleasant atmosphere. Rooms are all brand new and very modern.;5
First time in NYC,have to say hotel was ideal for us,a bit old but room was kept spotless every day by the cleaners,the location was excellent with MSG just across the road and Times Square a 10 minute walk away,staff were friendly and very helpful,hotel was reasonably priced also,what more would you want?will be back againðð»ðð;5
Great locaciÃ³n...A few steps from Times Square and Central Park. Plenty of shops and dinning. Two minutes from Moma museum and 5th Avenue. One block from subway. Rates arÃ© good and staff is grey friendly. DefinÃ­tely would come back.;5
I was staying here for 3 days and i had great time. good service, great food, nice view from rooms. Walking distance from Universal Studios.;5
Just stayed in the perfect hotel in the perfect location in New York City... 1930âs retro style 250 yards from Maddison square gardens, a few blocks from the Empire State Building and 20 minutes walking distance from time square and broadway...the hotel has a great diner and is very security minded (you canât even get to the lifts without showing your room key) and your stay comes with wi-fi and a fitness room... the view from our room on the 37th floor was spectacular and the staff couldnât be more helpful.... I canât praise this hotel enough!;5
The Empire Hotel is in an excellent location to walk to all sorts of venues and restaurants.  It is right across the street from Lincoln Center.  When we arrived, our room reservation had a problem due to a booking company's error, but Pasquale not only took care of the mistake but gave us an upgrade to a corner room with views of Lincoln Center and streets leading uptown.  We walked to our evening comedy show and to a fabulous restaurant, again just a couple blocks from the hotel.  We will definitely stay at this hotel again.;5
We really enjoyed staying at the Ameritania. Perfect location.  Friendly staff from front desk to bellman to staff in breakfast area.  Jeffrey, the bell man, was very helpful.  He arranged for a car for our family upon departure.  Desk staff went above and beyond...called us when our room was ready (we arrived at 8:00am).  Just a considerate & friendly staff!  Beds were comfortable.  Room very clean.  Bathroom up to date.  Cool lobby! Very nice!;5
Mayan was amazing! She was so kind we had a great experience at five on the hill. The service was efficient, as soon as we sat down on the table we took our order. The food came so fast and it was delicious!;5
The staff exceptional...Saturday movies by the pool excellent bartender Roberto clean rooms shuttle to/from universal convenient as was walking distance. Restaurant and parking prices a bit spendy but universal City Walk has plenty to choose from;5
This hotel provides outstanding service and accommodations. It truly is almost like a Ritz Carlton hotel.  All the rooms are excellent, but try to get a corner room. I actually prefer looking out over the highway and skyline but if your there for fun, try to get a room overlooking the Universal Studio's theme park.  Again, the staff is excellent.  If your staying over the weekend, you have to try the buffet which is truly unbelievable.  Within walking distance of Universal Studios park and night life. Plenty of people to meet and relax at the lobby bar after a long flight from the east coast.  The Matzo ball chicken soup is incredible with the fresh veggies.  Diplomats to kids, this hotel meets all the requirements.  You will not be disappointed.  And if you travel at least a;5
The room was clean. Bathroom had hot showers and didn't ever have to wait more than 5 minutes for one if them to open up.  There are a number of local restaurants near by and a couple minutes walk to metro.  We enjoyed having a light breakfast at Absolute Bagel which is just right around the corner. Great bagels and very popular with the locals.;5
Came up on a great stay last minute, pil was more than happy to help me and my guest. Love the atmosphere of the hotel and will be coming back. The pool is a sight to see and with the warm weather it was perfect ð¥°;5
This is a lovely Hotel and we were treated so nice. The buffet is really amazing, huge with so many wonderful choices, Crab legs, oysters on the half shell. prime Rib and Lobster, a taco bar, chocolate fountain, etc. Too many items to mention, Fresh and fabulous!;5
I don't quite know where to begin to tell you how incredible our stay was in the Riad Kheirredine.  My boyfriend organised a trip away for us and having never been to Morocco before, had a lot of questions. The staff at the Riad, emailed back promptly, charmingly and politely and made him feel at ease well before we arrived in Marrakesh. (Trust me, he had a lot of questions). The Riad itself is absolutely stunning, kept immaculately clean and really stands out as an Oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the Old Town.  You could spend most of your stay just there. But when you come back form your time in the Souks, there is nothing quite like settling yourself up on the terrace with your book and a delicious drink served with a smile.  Whilst an incredible Riad, it is;5
Always a pleasure to stay at the Empire.  Friendly staff, reasonable rates, rooms have plenty of space, are clean and well-maintained.  Starbucks in bldg and some great restaurants across the street.  Upper west side location is perfect for us (steps to #1 train and Lincoln Center, 5 min walk to Columbus Circle with shops., restaurants and more subway connections).  We often drive to NY and the hotel is very easy to get to with lots of parking choices nearby.;5
Definitely our first choice as LAX airport hotel !!! Really good hotel near the airport. It just fits everything. Great bar, restaurant with a la carte, as well as a 24/7 market. Large room, front desk and staff everywhere very friendly. Always my pleasure! Near the airport with a shuttle bus, you can also walk there. A 15-minute drive to Venice Beach and Marina Del Rey, Hollywood is 20 km away. By a tip from the front desk are comfortable with the bus to Santa Monica. Large (very) spacious and air-conditioned rooms with a modern design and free Wi-Fi. We had a direct view of the runway (soundproof windows). 55-inch cable HDTV, refrigerator, coffee maker, safe. The bathrooms are awesome with granite and marble, complimentary toiletries and hair dryer. The staff is wonderful, you;5
I loved how this hotel have updated itâs charm.  The first time I stayed here was the late 80âs.  Itâs evolved beautifully and kept itâs charm.  The staff, decor and rooms were all fantastic.... casual and genuine.  I do miss the jazz club in the lower floor!;5
The hotel was excellent for an airport hotel. Rooms very comfortable, breakfast good and staff great. It was a pleasant surprise as normally airport hotels to reach this level of comfort.. I would certainly go back.;5
"We were greeted by the man at the desk named Bryan. He was quite friendly and professional with us. There was no tention, no nothing negative from Bryan's side. Today, December 23rd we went down for the breakfast. The food, the service has all been great. We, as a family, do firmly believe that people who work in any particular place actually make the place. In case with breakfast in Hollywood Hotel we've felt that this type of people were JosÃ© and Juan, very friendly people, who are very much meant to be in a position that they are both in. People like JosÃ© and Juan are capable of enhancing any public place that has to deal with qualified serving the people. There is a moto: ""Of the people, by the people and for the people"". These two guys,JosÃ© and Juan, are both one of the";5
I stated at The Jane for 4 nights in a cabin room on a solo trip to NYC and was looking to stay somewhere a bit different. The Jane was a great find. Yes the rooms are small but they have everything you need for your stay. There is a luggage rack before the bed as well so your bags don't clutter up the room.   As others have said there never seemed to be a queue for the communal bathroom and they provide you with gown and slippers to go between there and your room.   If you're lucky enough to visit, as I was, when there is beautiful weather the rooftop bar has fantastic views of the Hudson. In the hot weather your room is also equipped with air con and a retro fan on the wall.   If you are arriving at the weekend in the evening though be aware that the area is very busy. When I;5
The staff was wonderful, room was roomy, great location , outstanding atmosphere. Only thing I would change would be shower doors , the design allowed water to escape shower and get on floor. Will definitely stay here again.;5
This hotel is in a great location close to time square.  The staff is very friendly, and Jeff is happy to hail you a cab anytime.  I  have stayed at this hotel several times  and have never been disappointed.;5
Just returned back from New York yesterday after 4 days. The whole experience was fabulous from start to finish. This was defiantly helped by staying at this hotel. The location is perfect. Penn station is literally next door so you can be on the subway within minutes of leaving your room. Or if you want to walk everything is within walking distance. The hotel its self is very big. Our room was on the 21st floor. Clean and exactly what you need it for. The room was an ok size for 2 people, storage for cases and your shopping was a little bit limited but didn't make a difference to how much we enjoyed it. The beds were very comfortable and we both slept soundly after full on days walking. Would defiantly stay at this hotel again.;5
We viewed the hotel and also made reservations for the Starline Tour with Cecille.  She's tops in terms of customer service. She is so efficient and assisted all customers very well.  She deserved to be commended for her knowledge and expertise in handling customers.;5
The Wyndham New Yorker is the perfect Hotel for any visit to New York. With Madison Square Garden parked less than 50 metres from the front door and a subway stop and railway station there also you're in ideal location for getting around.  The staff in the hotel are polite, friendly and very helpful. As we were on honeymoon the receptionist kindly upgraded our room and we were left with an amazing view of the City from our windows with the Empire State Building staring us in the face.  The food in the restaurant was very nice and was at a very reasonable price.;5
Really good stay! The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were good as well.. Lovely service and the food provided was good as well! Area is wonderful and the view is amazing.. The staff were very friendly and welcoming . always willing to help;5
Great location, wonderful hotel, helpful and friendly staff. Love the history of the hotel, and the location to the Tic Toc Diner. Pricing is often high but competetive. Security, although important can seem tedious at times especially when the hotel is busy. All the bathrooms could use an upgrade but overall very happy with the New Yorker.;5
In October I stayed at this hotel  Hilton at Universal CityWalk very clean, very friendly employees,, great customer service the view is amazing and the rooms are spectacular it is my favorite a place to stay other than being at my home I give a 5 out 5 stars overall. Special thanks to the staff at Hilton universal staff you guys Rock.;5
"We just stayed in the New Yorker (a Wyndham hotel) on 8th Avenue in Manhattan for four nights. What a wonderful stay! The hotel is a historic building (Nicola Tesla lived there for quite a while!) which has been tastefully updated. I have seen other reviews rating the rooms as ""tired."" I can only speak for our room, which is was just fine--clearly an older room but very clean and maintained with respect. If you want hyper-modern, this place is probably not for you, but we liked the whole ambience very well. For example, we really liked the older style of the bathroom, with fixtures that fit the history of the building. The staff could not have been more helpful--they all clearly take pride in their hotel, and they should. The lobby is, I would say, medium grand. The location is";5
I picked this hotel on a whim for my first visit to Manhattan.(Iâm from Virginia)  When I called to ask questions the staff was very polite and friendly. They recommended parking and addressed all of my concerns.  When I got there to check in my experience was even better! The two young ladies at the front desk were super sweet (Chainea and Sarah)! They explained everything thoroughly. They were  so kind and they also recommended places for me to go/eat. They genuinely cared  about my visit and my experience.  Thank you so much ladies for making my birthday trip so seamless and special!   Now as far as the hotel room itself.  Itâs decent. For the price I would give the room/hotel an 8 out of 10. For the price/location its very fair.   My two small complaints would be that the;5
Bar tenders were fabulous. Rooms spacious. Beds were a dream. Bathrooms great. Clean. Great service. Modern Hip. Great value.shuttle service ample. Staff warm and friendly. Great lobby and market place. Pool was beautiful. 24 hour room service!;5
I love this boutique hotel.  Very charming and close to wonderful restaurants. It is in a very noisy area of NYC.  There is no getting around this. The hotel is worth it.  Would love to come in summer and see the rooftop pool and bar.  My only complaint would be the water bottle wrapped in a bow (like a gift) next to your bed, that costs $8.00.  It should be in the mini/bar box like the rest of the snacks and drinks you might want to buy.  You will love your stay here.;5
Loved this hotel. Excellent location. Went to watch the basketball at Madison Square Gardens which was literally across the road as was Penn Street Station. Ended up taking the train back to the airport because it was so conveniently placed.  We had a twin room and it was a good size although dark because we were directly facing another block but not really an issue. Despite it being minus 15 overnight room was warm and the temperature was easily controllable from a panel in the room.  Easy access to large variety of food places and we particularly enjoyed the Italian in the hotel. Was also across the road from a CVS so easy to stock up on snacks and drinks.  Staff all lovely and helpful and everything lovely and clean with lots of history.;5
Believe everything you read this charming hotel....I feel rested and nice comfortable rooms..The Service was excellent and the food was all very nice..We so enjoyed our stay there and i hope to return.....;5
One of the desk staff has lived in the area her entire life.I told her I was a little hesitant to stay in this area of town and she said there was a time that this area was a little rough.  But a lot of effort went into making this area a great place to stay. And we really enjoyed it.;5
I was very comfortable in my room. Bed was clean and comfortable, and the shower had good water pressure and hot water. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is also in an excellent location, and there are several options for food and drink in the same building.;5
We were extremely pleased with our stay at Ameritania.  Matthew at the front desk was so welcoming and friendly. The bellmen were engaging and helpful. We will certainly return. Great location, but it's the customer service that will make us return.;5
The staff are amazing, courteous and proactive in offering help on every level.  Room service is a definite 10 out of 10!  Although right next to the airport, you hear nothing in room.  I would know too, because my room faced the airport! I look forward to my next stay.;5
We stayed here for 4 nights in Jan 2020. The hotel is lovely and clean and staff are extremely helpful, one doorman in particular named siad couldn't have helped us enough, from taking our cases to our room to providing us with information to enjoy our stay he was worth his weight in gold. The only negative thing I would say was that the room state that they have a refrigerator which ours didn't and on the Sunday and Monday night the bar wasn't opened which was abit strange as it says that it's open daily from 5-11pm. Despite these few negative things I would definitely return.;5
Fantastic city that surpassed all expectations and the New Yorker hotel was perfect. On 34th Street with Empire State Building and Macys within 5 minutes walk and situated next to Penn Station so easy to get about and see the rest of the city. Hotel was very clean & comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Tick Tock diner is great for both breakfast and dinner.  The location was ideal for most of the main must see sights and Times Square had the added bonus of us joining in with a world record attempt during our stay. Only there for 4 days but already planning a return and to the New Yorker hotel.;5
Victor at the bar was amazing! Although the bar was busy he was extremely hospitable to my daughter and I! Informative, quick service, and went the extra mile by making my daughter her favorite soft drink! 10/10  My server Jose was amazing as well! Very patient with my many annoying questions and requests. While the rooms are OK I will 100% stay here because of the service the bars and restaurants exert here. No need to even leave when staying;5
The hotel was great. The room we had was large enough and very clean. Nights were noisy because we were in the city.  At the Trottoria Bianca Restaurant, the service we received was very slow and there were not many people in the restaurant. Went there twice and had two different servers.  Had to get the hostess to get our server both times.;5
My husband and I travelled for 1 week to Marrakech (with a 3 day tour to Merzouga  in the middle of the week). We stayed at Riad Kheirredine for other nights we were in Marrakech. Aside from the fact that this Riad is beautiful and is well kept, it has the most amazing staff. Everyone (front office staff, wait staff and everyone else) were so warm and welcoming and extremely helpful. We would go out everyday and would forward to coming back to the Riad to just hangout on the roof. The breakfast is excellent the the rest of the food on the menu is pretty decent.  We also had a massage and the Hammam and it was a very relaxing experience.  We definitely also took advantage of the laundry service! :) We look forward to returning to Marrakech and would definitely stay here again. We;5
Stayed for 5 nights in June 22 from check in to check out the was no issues at all, the staff are friendly & a credit to the hotel. Yes the hotel is a bit dated so if you wanting a shining new style this is not the place for you but if you want a hotel with character & charm this is the place. The room we had did not have a view but that was ok because as we know the size of NYC hotel rooms are on the small size the room we had was massive even having 2 bathrooms & the maids kept it spotless each day for us. I like the way you have to show your room key to get access to the lifts so the place feels safe. The only down thing for me is was the lack of no bar to have a drink in it's not the same sitting in a dinner or restaurant if you fancy a beer at the end of the day;5
Lovely hotel very friendly staff great location rooms very clean and modern will hope to go again someday ticktock restaurant seems to be part of the hotel and the food was lovely very New York City style had a great trip;5
Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a suite without even asking.  We had a corner room with an awesome view, sitting room w/extra bathroom and a patio.  That said, I cannot comment on a standard room.  The location is great as it is close to the train station and not too far from some major attractions i.e., times square, etc. without all the noise of staying in times square.  The hotel is old but we prefer old and quirky with a little history.  The cost per night was very reasonable compared to some other hotels.  There is a diner which is open 24 hours.   We were able to store our luggage for $5.00 ea. on the day of check-out since we had a late train.  The hotel is not  5-star but for the price, it was fine especially if you are out and about most of the time.;5
Highly recommended. Nice riad, with plenty of space, terraces and two plunge pools (still rather cold end of April). Staff goes really out of their way to accommodate the guests and give tips of what to do and where to go. Great breakfast and we also enjoyed the dinner. Location is fine, some 10 to 12 min walk to beginning of Medina. Transfer to and from airport was included. We struggled with the slow or non-existent WiFi connections the first two days but that got solved afterwards.;5
I really enjoyed my stay at the Empire Hotel it was very clean and quiet ,staff was very accomidating and helpful from door man to desk. Enjoyed the view's and sittimg area on the roof. Check in and out was an easy process.;5
An old Art Deco hotel with lots of character. We were upgraded by Mohammed to a room with a view. Lying in bed looking at the Empire State Building was incredible. Mohammed also gave us vouchers for a complimentary breakfast in the Tick Tock diner. Excellent food. We used the subway a lot and this hotel is in the perfect location to go everywhere. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Great hotel for location and price. V nice common areas. Rooms quite snug and bathroom very tight, but do you care in NYC - when you are out all day/evening anyway? Gorgeous view of Lincoln Center from room. Location cant be beat. Rooms nicely decorated. Will stay again, definitely.;5
For the price, you can't go wrong. This is easily one of the best in the area. Everything was excellent, from the room and the cleanliness of the areas, to the attitude of the staff. The location is one of the best qualities.;5
Stayed here at the end of our Spring break and it was such a great ending to our vacation. The hotel was clean, the room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful. Thank you to Gisel at the front desk for making our stay so enjoyable and being so helpful to my kids and I.  She was attentive and courteous and even helped us with taxis and shuttles so that we can enjoy the city. We will definitely come back!!;5
Jalal was the most helpful bellboy I had ever met. Nothing was too much trouble, all done with a smile!   The Hotel was great, really comfortable beds. Excellent chamber maids, immaculate room.   Close to all sites!;5
Our stay here was excellent, when we unexpectedly needed to change rooms Daniel at the front desk went out of his way to make sure our accommodations went above and beyond expectations, thank you! 5 â­ï¸ stars;5
This is my 2nd time at the Ameritania. What I love about the Ameritania is the staff from the doormen to the front desk - they are efficient & friendly. Our room was excellent w/ fun decor. & though tight w/ two beds-- we had a comfortable stay. I stayed here 4y ago w/ my older teen daughter & we had a great time. 4y later, the hotel still feels fresh & looks nice inside the room. The only update that would have made our stay a little better would be outlets or USB access bedside for charging.  The city view rooms are nicer a stay (4y ago), but if your out & about your entire visit (this stay), you'll probably not notice.  Recommend this hotel  :);5
I canât say enough good things about this hotel. I have stayed in several premier inns before so I know what to expect and this one didnât disappoint.  The location was/is perfect and was so close to everything we needed. It was my mums birthday so I rang before and asked for a room with a view. We got an amazing view of the London eye thank you so much, we even got to check in an hour early!   With the windows open the room was quite I mean it wasnât completely silent by any means but it wasnât as loud as we were originally thought it was going to be. The room was clean and so was the bathroom. The best part was we booked a twin room and to our surprise we got two double beds usually we get a single/sofa bed and then a double or king so this was really nice.  Our room wasnât;5
I visited Marrakesh with my mum and we are so happy that we chose to stay at Riad Kheirredine. The Riad is beautiful, with amazing views to the Atlas Mountains, great food and clean, stylish, spacious rooms. But what really makes the Riad is it's very friendly staff! Everyone was so welcoming and kind and you really felt looked after. This was our first trip to Marrakesh and the Riad stopped it from feeling overwhelming from providing you with a local mobile phone so you can always call the Riad for advice or to book a taxi to having someone walk you through the medina to restaurants or to the taxi rank. They also booked us on a half day guided tour of the Medina with the lovely Mohammed -- which was the perfect introduction to Marrakesh. The spa in the Riad was also excellent;5
First time in New York. The room was small but I have view of Empire State Building and Madison square garden. My friend lives in NYC so he was my tour guide we took the subway to time Square only one stop away.;5
The hotel was in a great location, just a short walk to all of the things to see as well as the subway station.  The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable of everything.  Jeffery was a huge help in suggesting places to see and how to get there. The hotel phones were down the entire stay but really wasn't an issue for us. I will definitely be back!;5
We loved this hotel! The location was excellent as it was a short walk to Westminster area and not too far to Waterloo Station. We also enjoyed the play, Witness for the Prosecution, which happened to be in the same building (5minute walk). And enjoyed afternoon tea also in the London County Hall building, another short stroll. Our room was clean and comfy. The service at the front desk was very friendly and helpful especially Francesca. Breakfast buffet was also good. Highly recommend this hotel.;5
After such great reviews this place had a lot to live up to and it did more than that! The Riad is beautiful and the staff are amazing. They are attentive but not pushy & can't do enough for you.  The reviews are true when they say that this place feels like home, as soon as I walked in I felt relaxed - which was exactly what we wanted.  Breakfast is lovely & the timing of it amazing they prepare it whenever you want it! Giving you a phone, a bottled water & a guide when you go for a walk & free wifi are just a couple of lovely touches about this place. Would definitely recommend!;5
We loved the location it was just a few blocks from everywhere we wanted to be.  Room was small but lovely. Clean & compact. We were room only so didnât eat here. I found the business room downstairs a great idea free of charge for printing flight documents etc & also we could make free calls. Would definitely return.;5
I was invited by a friend to attend a wedding in New York.  She booked the room at the empire and we were never happier.  We are from Texas and wanted to be tourist which we did.  The staff was excellent and ever so helpful.  Conceirge service, door men, desk check-in, let me name Frank, Gabe and Girrard...as outstanding employees if the year in our eyes.  So helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back to the Empire.;5
Me and my husband came for a 5 day break and was amazing the hotel staff were all lovely and helpful especially Jeffery. We would definitely come Back again. Room was always clean and we had clean towels everyday. Room good size for New York and shower was amazing. :-);5
Dont even know from where to start: Riad Kheirredine exceed our expectations and went above and beyond of it!  Spent the birthday of my best friend last month and all the staff was phenomenal: from the airport pick up to the greeting from one of the front desk ladies to the cleaning ladies, the guys always available to escort and to not forget the kitchen members.  The homemade breakfast was delicious and rich: we had it in each spot of the Riad. We also dine there once and our favorite plates so far are now the beef tanja and the lamb tajine. For our last day we got pampered in their Spa: do not miss the scrubbing at the hammam! Our skin was so soft and the best part was a surprising birthday cake given to my best friend when we finished our treatment and were escorted to our;5
The New Yorker is probably the best hotel Iâve ever stayed in. Every interaction with staff was great, particularly the wonderful lady who checked us in and made every endeavour to make our special trip even more special. Even the people that checked our room keys for security put smiles on our faces every time we walked in or out!  The hotel is so iconic and all the Art Deco features are beautiful. The view made waking up in the morning an absolute dream, and the bed was so comfy that it was the one thing to stop me wanting to jump out in excitement! Every day, the room was cleaned to a faultless standard.   Thanks to all the wonderful staff, and a great hotel, for a perfect stay!;5
We were here for 10 nights and it was a great time. The hotel is very good located and has a nice staff. Especially the conscierge Said was very friendly and polite. He answered every question and gave us the best insider tips. We would come back every time.;5
From the moment you enter Riad Kheirredine until, the moment you leave you are well looked after.  All non-alcoholic drinks are included (including fresh orange and lemon juice) - and there was complimentary fruit aplenty, where ever you sat -  this was a first for us.  The truly delightful owner and her very capable Manager Elena made sure their very capable staff took care of all our needs - and they did it with a genuine smile.  Not to forget that the laundry was included - washing and ironing.  Being a swimmer - it was nice to have access to two small lap pools.  Guides assisted us to find our way around Medina, they also organised taxis - which can be a tricky system as most taxi drivers don't use meters!  We would highly Riad Kheirredine to anyone who is looking for;5
Stayed at the ... For a weekend together with FOUR adolescents and had one of the best hotel stays ever. Although the reservation of the second room was made later, they had connecting rooms waiting for us and held them despite our past midnight arrival.Â  The rooms are pretty good standard, rather good noise insulation, shower with hand shower and overhead head, really fresh amenities, fruit basket and two waters at arrival, Lavazza coffee maker - thank heavens!, good beds and bedding, nice room layout - not your standard box. The only drag with the rooms - cannot open a window... Oh, not to forget the multi-, and I mean multi, adaptor charging station. Keep all the wire fuzz in the suitcase - they gotcha covered. Now the make or break - mostly break - of hotels: service! The;5
Walking distance from Universal and they also have shuttles throughout the day. Staff is extremely professional. Very curteous and helpful. Very clean room and beds are very comfortable. We loved our stay and will be back in the future.;5
We stayed here for 4 nights before heading to Essaouira. The Riad  was excellent, everything was very  tasteful, very clean and very comfortable. The staff were very welcoming and friendly  and the service was excellent. The staff put so much thought into making our stay in Marrakech as enjoyable and as stress free as possible, it provided us with  a calm oasis in the  chaotic centre of Marrakech. The staff provided helpful local advice, arranged our  day trip to the Atlas mountains and even went to the coach station to buy our coach transfer tickets for us. I can only equate our hotel stay to being spoilt  like teenagers, waited on by indulgent and gracious people with  our every need anticipated and fulfilled - it's a very restful experience !;5
The free breakfast was amazing complete and excellent thank you to Hugo , Lupe and JosÃ© for the omelete, the chocolate waffles and chocolate pancakes it was amazing and nice to meet you guys...Thank you for all.  ThÃ© french couple.;5
I have been in Marrakech a few times over the past years and I thought I knew what to expect from staying in the Medina. However, this time I was looking for something different: a place where I could relax with my partner and where everything is taken care of. So, after some research and a couple of recommendations, I decided to book this Riad. I was amazingly surprised that you can actually find such a beautiful paradise still within the Medina without having to go too far out. We had a nice and spacious room with a living room and large bathroom! So comfortable! And trust me, being pregnant I needed some space! The Riad is very large and has a lot of nice spaces where you can space out and relax. Also, breakfast on the rooftop in the morning early sun was a new discovery and;5
Stayed here when we were going to Universal Hollywood.  Loved it great views from the room and a five to ten minute walk to Universal all on sidewalks and very well lit. Stayed with kids the stay was great.  Has on-site parking garage that is easy and affordable to do self parking ($35/night).;5
Stay at The Empire Hotel for epic views of the Lincoln Center fountain. It's a great location in the city with lots of great restaurants nearby. The bathroom in the hotel room is small but the room is very clean and nice. The hotel staff is very nice and helpful--especially Luis at the front desk.;5
We loved this hotel so much! Our room was big and beautiful, overlooking a courtyard full of plants and trees. The breakfast was fabulous (not always the case with an included breakfast) and the sauna was an amazing feature. Thanks for everything - would absolutely recommend this hotel!;5
I was in LA for holiday and was very impressed by this hotel. I was at another 2 star hotel near hollywood walk of fame cos I heard its more central. But the condition of that hotel was so horrible that I checked out after just 1 nite and moved to Hilton. It was my best decision during the trip.  We got the 14th floor overlooking universal studio. Room has a great view with the best bed and bathroom. Best of all, we got the room at just slightly over $130 per nite. It is only marginally more expensive than the 2 star hotel we stayed the nite before at Hollywood. We drove, so the location was not a problem at all. Universal Studio is only 5mins walk away, or if you prefer you could catch the free shuttle provided at the hotel. Definitely recommend this hotel to all holiday and;5
Staying in this boutique hotel was an amazing experience. It is magical to go through the door and find yourself inside this beautiful place with its courtyards with pools and trees. We stayed in the Ambra room and loved it. It is located near the top terraces, where we had a delicious breakfast each morning (even though it was early winter). The hotel is conveniently located inside the medina, only 10 minutes walk from the souks. Our hosts were amazing. They spent time with us when we arrived giving us information about Marrakech. Not only did the staff provide us with maps with the route to the hotel marked out, they also gave us mobile phones in case we became completely lost in the maze of souks and needed to be rescued. if we wanted refreshments, laundry done, tours;5
I Booked this hotel last minute with plans of proposing to my then girlfriend across the street at the beautiful Lincoln Center.  Upon hearing of this plan We were upgraded to a room with a view of Lincoln Center.  The staff was obviously extremely accomidating and friendly.  The Room had a lovely view of Lincoln Center with a little to be expected street noise, come on you're in NYC its unavoidable.  I found the room to be well appointed and comfortable.  I will say that the half shower glass wall was a little odd and did get the bathroom floor a little wet but other than that a great room, in a great hotel, in a FABULOUS location.  Thank you very much for providing a comfortable end to a great and memorable day.  We will be back;5
I was in LA for five nights for a convention downtown, but since my wife was along, we decided to stay out in Universal City.  The Hilton was less expensive than the downtown hotels, and really could not have been much nicer. Everyone from the doorman, front desk, bellman, room service, to housekeeping staff was very friendly, helpful, and polite. The room had a great view of the Universal City Walk, and you could look all the way down the Hollywood Freeway and see the city skyline (when the LA haze cleared!). The room had a huge TV, refridgerator, and safe.  The bed was just how we like it. Universal City is located at the top of a steep hill. The Hilton is also near the top of the hill, so the walk from the hotel to Universal is not too bad, but if you want to go down the hill;5
My daughter and I stayed for 5 nights at the Empire, following her knee surgery. We were in the room 24/7, except for me leaving to get get food and supplies. I was concerned at first, reading some of the other reviews, but our stay could not have been better. The staff was welcoming and accommodating. I had to trade out ice packs frequently throughout the day and night with the staff at the desk. All were gracious and helpful.  Iâd like to give a special shout out to Ami, who called me twice to make sure everything was to my liking. Other notable staff who assisted during a difficult time were:  Adam,Herman, Fatima, and Chortten.  The housekeeping staff was respectful of our privacy and cleared away trash, and brought fresh towels and toiletries, even though we couldnât have;5
Great location! 2 min walk to Times Square and Central Park.comfy bed. Room was warm and no noise volume. Staff really friendly. See Jeff,the consierge, he kept us right in where to go and how to get there;5
Super clean, newly refurbished. Location is even great if you're not flying out. Super views of planes an added bonus. An oasis in the middle of LA that I really didn't expect since everything else in LA was full;5
I was so nervous arriving at the Empire thinking we'd made a mistake after lots of negative feedback on Trip Advisor. In fact it was an amazing place, we had a stunning room and didn't need help with anything. We have some fab memories of our trip and all made better for staying at this beautiful hotel. We will be back...;5
All you could want from a hotel with an excellent location. The only possible criticism is that the wi-fi is too expensive for this day and age and tricky to connect a second device. Staff are outstanding.;5
We were traveling on our way back to South Africa and wanted to see Universal Studios so booked at this hotel as time was short. Out of our entire holiday, this was the best experience. The hotel staff were amazing and Linda went out of her way to make us feel very welcome. Our room was perfect, spacious and clean with plenty of additional bottled water supplied. The shuttle transferred us to (US) and we had an incredible day only leaving when they closed the doors. Back to our fab hotel for a quick shower and off to a great Italian restaurant across the way. Linda even gifted us breakfast which was so much appreciated and a delicious selection too. I would not hesitate to stay here again.;5
We chose to go to Marrakech after a bicycling trip in Spain, and using Trip Advisor and the reviews contained, we ultimately decided to stay at Riad Kheirredine.  I have never stayed at a place so totally devoted to customer care.  From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left, we found the entire staff, without exception, to be friendly, always willing to assist in any way they could.  We stayed in the Lotus room.  It was comfortable, with excellent air conditioning, exceptionally clean and well maintained and looks even better in real life than the on line pictures!  The office staff (Delila, Cinzia, Valentina and Alena) were absolutely fantastic.  Food, if you decide to have a dinner there (which we did on our day of arrival, since we were simply too tired to go;5
This Riad is truly something special.  The staff is incredibly friendly and inviting at all times.  Sara, Elena, and a lady whose name escapes me but starts with SH were all very helpful and kind.  The gentlemen who walked us to the souk area were so helpful at all times and it was so nice to be greeted with a warm smile when we arrived after a day of excursions or activities.  They go above and beyond to make you feel welcome.  Daily room service, laundry, an AMAZING breakfast that comes to you wherever you'd like in the RIAD. I recommend having breakfast on the rooftop if possible.  It has wonderful views.  I've stayed at Four Seasons, Fairmonts, Ritz Carltons,and others and never do you get the attention to detail for you as you do with this staff.  We arrived on NYE and;5
Ups to the HH went to 3 different hotels and it was a no go. Closed closed closed. Rolled up to the hotel and no problem. Pil works the nights keeping the hotel safe and keeping everything ð¯ . Mask, cashier glass, purell to clean off the IDS and credit card he handled before he hands it back. Made me feel safe and comfortable. Hollywood Hotel stays beating the Covid-19. Mad love and props to the hotel l.;5
"The Empire is always my ""go to"" hotel in Manhattan.  A fresh boutique experience, great rooms ingeniously designed to seem larger even though they are typically small as in most NYC hotels.  The building is one of the oldest NYC original hotels, artfully renovated, with a rooftop bar, pool with cabannas, and set in the lovely Lincoln Ctr area, just a few blocks from Central Park, and 1,2,3 subway line.  Cool lobby bar and hopping nightclub in rooftop bar round out the scene...Some of the rooms might be noisy depending on location, but this is New York, not a cabin in the woods!!!";5
This is my second visit to this Premier Inn. It is situated perfectly, only a few minutes walk to Parliament Square ant many Landmarks, right in front of the London Eye. Welcoming and efficient staff, The rooms are comfortable and clean, nothing fancy, but just right. It is a no frills hotel, which is just suits me fine, a great nights sleep, with a good shower, and despite it being a large hotel, very quiet. The breakfast is very good. I would have no hesitation in staying again.;5
All accommodations were excellent. despite obvious shortage of staff, all persons were kind, respectful, courteous and professional.  Only problem I experience was the extreme cold in lobby area, where we had to sit and eat.;5
"OMgosh, the best sheets ever!  I wanted to stay in bed, inside those starched magnificent sheets!  No problems for us, at all.  I adore historic hotels and this was the place!  The ""home"" of Inventor Tesla, his last 10 years.  Anyway, friendly staff, clean rooms, the price was right for NY.  Right in the heart of the city, for our purposes (tourists).  Adjacent to the Tick Tock, 24-hr. restaurant which serves REAL MILK SHAKES.    Upon check-in, the employee ""bumped"" us higher up and we had a pretty good view of the Hudson River.  I'll definitely stay here again, like this coming summer.  We had 2 double beds which ""enlarged"" our room somewhat and finding 2 beds in NY ain't easy.  I tried to get out of the $50 surcharge (we booked 3rd party), but no luck.  Have you read ""Heads in";5
I travel to NY often for business and pleasure.  Over the years I have stayed at most of the better hotels in the City.  The Empire Hotel has become my home away from home.   Great location near a diverse selection of restaurants (some of the best outdoor locations in NY), Central Park and Lincoln Center.  The rooms are hip, but comfortable.  Nice pool deck during the summer.   A fashionable clientele, especially during fashion week.  The highlight is the staff.  They treat everyone like a celebrity.  I have stayed at the Empire at least 20 times during the past year and I am a demanding customer.  The Empire has never failed to impress.   Especially if there is a small problem (which happens at all hotels), it is taken care of promptly and effectively.   My best testimonial:  I;5
"My wife and I come from New Zealand and stayed at the Hilton from the 8th to 12th April and loved it. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the room was on the 20th floor and  had a good view of the city. It was big, clean and comfortable. There was no fridge in the room but one was quickly brought up at no extra cost.The location is great, right across the road from Universal Studios and there is a super market 10 minutes walk away. On the last day our shuttle failed to arrive so the hilton gave us there ""town car"", a limo, and drove us to our next destination, now that's service. I would strongly reccomend this hotel to anyone going to LA.";5
I loved the room the bed was very comfortable and the staff was nice. I wouldn't mind going there again someday...;5
We have stayed at the Hilton Universal Studio many times over several years. Always a perfect stay and the location cannot be beat. There is a shuttle to the park and the Universal Studio's City walk. So you spend the day at the park, back to the hotel to shower and get ready for dining and a nigh of entertainment on the city walk. Never have to drive or get in your car during your stay at the hotel is you are just doing the park. It is tucked back away from the hustle of LA traffic. 1 minute off the freeway to easy access when you are ready to venture out in the car. Rooms are huge and the staff is so nice and professional. This hotel is safe, secure and worth every cent due to it's location to the park. You can take the shuttle but it's just as easy to walk there. No matter;5
I stayed here recently for 4 nights with my husband and son, mainly to visit universal studios.  We are Hilton Honor members and this was one of the most professional and efficient Hiltons we have ever stayed in.  Check in was fast,  the man at the desk gave us all the information in regards to the hotel we needed for our stay, he then walked us to the elevators and sent us on our way to our room on the executive level. The room had a great view of Universal Studios, it was very clean with everything we needed.  Each afternoon we would receive a tray of fresh fruit, cookies, chocolates, cake and bottled water..WOW WHAT A TREAT.   Walking to Universal is pretty easy once you do it for the first time,  if you dont like to walk (approx 10 mins)  the hotel has a free shuttle bus.;5
this was our first visit to Marrakech. Staying in the Medina close to all the hustle and bustle, with local staff is a great way to discover a place. We trusted them all and was rewarded with an experience which is hard to measure in terms of service or comparison. We stayed in the ecalyctus suite. The decor throughout was very well put together, even the smallest of details made our three nights very special. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Even when we were rescued in the evening, on the wrong side of the Medina. Having a pre-paid mobile for us to stay in touch was a wonderful way of saying, please discover our beautiful and ancient city. We will cone and collect you when you are ready. We will be back one day.;5
We had 5 days in the great city of Marrakesh, which was enhanced by staying in Riad Kheirredine. Our guidebook stated that accomodation during a stay in Marrakesh can make or break you holiday, well this place certainly made it.  Location is slightly out of town (15 min walk to the main square) but it's always an interesting walk and on your first trip away from the hotel, the staff show you the way and set you off with a Morrocan mobile and a map.  The Riad courtyard is so peaceful, the small pluge pool very inviting. The roof terrace is spectacular. Great views of the city best enjoyed just after sunset with the numerous Mosques calling to prayer at the same time.  Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had (I've had a few). Service was second to none. Khalid seemed to work;5
The Hollywood Hotel has an amazing energy that is both relaxing and stimulating at the same time. We can here hungry and tired from our travels and we were rejuvenated by our experiences. Rooms were spotless. The service was superb. Hugo was our personal chef and he made us freshly made omelettes and scrambles to order. The courtyard had an exclusive bar. The sauna was the perfect temperature. The pool was saltwater and refreshing. We loved our stay and the best was our ESA companion was fully welcomed. Thank you Hollywood Hotel management and staff for making our stay pleasant.;5
They have a great breakfast and the ladies in front allowed me to check in earlier than 3pm with out extra charge thanks ladies I really appreciate that, people like me who travel really need to get their room with out and extra charge;5
Stayed here one night and the service was excellent! Shuttle to Universal was awesome. Enjoyed pool in evening and it was gorgeous! Didnât try breakfast but Iâm sure it was great - just felt it was a little overpriced. Overall a great stay!;5
We have stayed at The Hilton Universal city many times. If we go to Universal Studios, itâs a short walk to the park. They also provide a shuttle to the park that we did not use this trip. The rooms are large, clean, and very nice.  Overall, the hotel is well kept and tidy.  This stay was remarkable when compared to the previous 2 or 3 stays. When we arrived, the valets and other hotel staff greeted us and were ready to help us take our bags to our room. That didnât happen our last stay (May 2018) when I had to track down a valet and there was nobody to help with bags.  At check in, Roxann, at the Hilton Honors desk was very friendly and efficient. When we asked for a room upgrade due to diamond status, she had already entered us into the upgraded room. My daughter mentioned;5
Check in and key via app makes it so easy to show up whenever it fits you and go directly to your room. Dinner at Lounge was delicious and the server went above and beyond offering tips on local to-doâs. Clean, efficient and service oriented, would highly recommend. Shuttle to Universal Studios makes it real easy throughout the morning & day. We walked back (10 mins) at night when it was cooler and got some drinks and snack for the kids and cocktails to take up to the room from the bar. Delicious and superb. Staff is service oriented and very friendly, makes you feel valued. Again, would highly recommend.;5
We stayed here in May for 4 nights, was not disappointed, lovely clean room. The man on reception was very nice when we checked in, got a complimentary bottle of wine sent to our room . Perfect location . Ate breakfast each day in the Tick Tock diner, great , big portions but lovely to set you up for a day of sight seeing. Really nice hotel, perfect. wifi kept dropping off at times.;5
The friendly staff, exceptional service, great food and the beautiful features of the Riad defined our trip to Marrakech. Staying at Riad Kheirredine enhances your experience of  Marrackech - it makes the difference between having a 'nice' trip and a 'fantastic' one! The theme to my review is that this Riad is fantastic!  All the staff made us feel welcome and comfortable - nothing was ever too much for them. Three members of staff, in particular, made our stay fantastic - Elaine, Valentina and Ismail.   A porter collected us from the taxi drop off point, and on arrival at the Riad we received a fantastic, warm and friendly welcome. We then enjoyed a traditional Moroccan breakfast despite the late hour of our arrival from the airport. It was explained to us that breakfast could;5
The hotel was ideally located where I could get to my conference everyday using the subway and then was close to plenty of things for activities for night. The staff was friendly and the room was perfect for what I needed it for.;5
Great accommodations.  Fabulous weekend Buffet.  Extremely helpful Concierge. Beautiful wedding going on, lovely bridal party and guests (we were not guests) Easy access to City Walk, and Universal Studios.;5
I wrote this great long review in all capital letters and then it was rejected because I used capital letters -- I use them because I am a terrible typist and have arthritis.  So I am not typing all of that again -- yell at Trip Advisor.  So to be blunt the place is great for the single traveler a step or two above hostel, and three steps below the Four Seasons.  I don't have the energy to type the rest.;5
Great location, great view for us of the Empire State Building & Madison Square Gardens.  An interesting historical building with a clean room and restaurant options on site.  Would choose to stay again.;5
Directly across the street from Lincoln Center, the location could not have been better. Pasquale at the front desk was very kind and helpful as were all the bellmen we encountered. The lobby was beautiful and our room, despite being on the small side (which is to be expected for an older hotel), was well-appointed and nicely decorated in an art-deco style. As long as you go in with the right expectations, you will hopefully see how charming the Empire is, as we did.;5
I have recently stayed at The Empire Hotel and loved it.  The room was beautiful and the staff very friendly.  One staff member that stood out was Nicole Agnello.  She was very friendly and helpful during the booking and planning process.;5
We visited Marrakech to celebrate our wedding anniversary and selected Riad Kheirredine based on the fantastic reviews - Iâm so glad we did.  All four of us have travelled a fair amount over the years and we all agreed that RK provided the best hotel service any of us have ever experienced. Forget Dubai, Singapore or Mauritius. All have fantastic hotels, but nothing compares to the bespoke service the team provide at this beautiful 13 room Riad.  Most decent hotels have nice/lavish rooms, well selected furnishings and good food/drinks BUT the crucial factor here is the staff. EVERY one of them is friendly, polite and will do anything they can to exceed your expectations. You cannot understand the level of service until you experience it.  Breakfast was of the highest quality -;5
We stayed here before my flight out of LAX. The room was extremely quiet. We could not hear any planes or road noise. I was not yet a Hyatt Explorist at the time, so I was not offered any upgrades on my room as someone who just used Chase Ultimate Rewards to transfer over my points. We also checked in late at night, and they offered us water at check-in.;5
Staff went above and beyond to make our short stay a 5 star experience on Broadway. A specials thanks both to the bartender Javier, and knowledgeable lovely concierge for helping my family and (lost bestfriend) get to the Christmas Spectacular Rockettes on time!!!;5
Arrived on 3rd July for 5 nights, staying with parents and my sister.  On arrival at 1 p.m. my parents room was ready and were pleased to be told they had been upgraded to a deluxe double. Our room was not ready but were given a discount voucher for drinks and food at the rooftop/pool bar.  At around 3 p.m we went back down to reception, our room was ready at around 3.40 p.m.  We booked a deluxe room with 2 double beds, floor 6 - the room was lovely, comfy beds, a seated area, and bathroom was a fair size.  Shower was powerful and did not leak.  The only draw back of the room was the price of items in the mini bar, and price of coffee.  However we cheated slightly by bringing our own tea and coffee, as you could heat up the water on its own (shop just round the corner that sold;5
I stayed at the Empire Hotel for business purposes and was very impressed with the location, service and condition of the property. It was very close to where my meeting was held and next time I will just walk instead of taking a taxi. I had breakfast at the 12th floor restuarant and took in the great views of the city and enjoyed the wide array of food offering on the buffet. Also, it is so close to some of the best tourist sites in NYC, I have found my hotel when visiting this wonderful city!;5
Sonia was very nice and did an excellent job        The hotel was in a good location and had no problems. The bed was nice and soft The food selection in the breakfast was good and I like that the omelets can be made in front of you and could put anything in them. Awesome that there's a pool, sauna, and gym. The hotel has a lot of nice things going on for it.;5
Recently visited the Empire Hotel Lobby Bar. As one of my favorite places to socialize, can't stress enough how much I always have a great time while I'm there. Went there last weekend with a few friends and had an amazing time again. Aaron Collins and Gabe were great as always. Very gregarious, helpful and entertaining. Our glasses were always full and our spirits were always high. Can't wait for the next time I'm there.;5
We would just like to send a huge and sincere thank you to all the staff at Riad Kheirredine.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Riad and would not hesitate to stay their again on our next trip to Marrakesh. The staff was friendly and helpful explaining to us all the favourite tourist sites we should see (and assisting us with extremely precise directions, we did not get lost once!). The staff also had our safety in mind and even provided us with a cellphone which we could use any time of the day, if we needed their assistance or if we did get lost in the maze of Marrakesh streets. The rooms were beautiful, clean and cozy. The food was delicious and scrumptious, and all in all, our experience at Riad Kheirredine was delightful and one filled with only good memories. We would;5
What a superbly positioned hotel. Our bags were lost en route and we were really well looked after by Pil and Angelica. This made a huge difference. Also walking distance from metro which makes a huge difference. Fully recommend. Thanks;5
I throughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. However, there should be a shuttle to and from the airport. Also I have stayed in much less expensive hotels/motels where Wi-Fi is free. It is $7.95 a day here unless you have enough Hilton Honors points which I did not. Buffets were expensive. Otherwise, it was wonderful. Beds are heavenly.;5
We spent a week in this beautiful Riad. The staff were fantastic and very proud of their service and surroundings. They could not help us enough. The Riad is very tranquil and relaxing with beautiful views. We loved it.;5
I would highly recommend the Hilton Universal Studios Los Angeles, CA.  The staff offer exceptional customer service.  You always feel like they truly care. The check in process is always outstanding and the guest rooms are large, very clean and the Housecleaning staff does a great job! My husband and I have stayed there several times and each visit was outstanding.;5
the front desk made extra effort to have our room next to our friend's.  They even upgraded us to a corner room with panorama view- over look Universal studio.  What a treat!!  Staffs were very friendly.  The hotel was right next to Universal Studio.  very convenient to see Harry Potter Wizard world.  Great stay!!;5
Beautiful rooms and exactly where we wanted to be located for our first trip to NYC. We didn't even need to use the subway for our first 2 days because the location was so convenient. Some of the rooms are very small but that is to be expected, and both rooms we were in were clean and stylish. Reasonably priced and the air conditioning was a huge, huge added benefit.;5
I stayed here in 2011. This hotel is perfectley situated 5 minutes walk from Times Square. Central for everything. Rooms are lovely with everything you need. Nice comfy beds too with perfect after a long day site seeing. Would highly recommend.;5
We stayed at the Hilton Universal City in Jan 2012. We changed our mind on arrival and requested two rooms, Pamela (supervisor on Front Desk) was fantastic and identified our needs immediately and matched them to a King Corner suite with connecting room for the teenagers, offered a discounted rate for the second room and was fantastic for the whole stay. The hotel is close to Universal Studios and City Walk for nighttime dining and shopping. City Walk was a little seedy as the night wore on so - don't let your teens stroll alone. the hotel offered a good buffet but otherwise expensive for snacks etc. Don't hesitate if you want proximity to the Studio. Get yourself a fast pass if visiting the studio - travelling from Australia we won't be back soon so we got to try everything;5
I  mistakingly forgot to confirm but the manager was able to accomodate my needsfor my daughter's 12th birthday sleepover that we were having at the hotel.;5
I have stayed in the New Yorker twice first in 2015 with friends and again in 2018 i took my granddaughter for her birthday,and i just loved it!!!!, staff are amazing rooms very comfortable beds are a dream to sleep in spotlessley clean,Hopefully the same group of friends will be at the New Yorker this December i cannot wait and again next year for my grandaughters 13th and my 60th look forward to seeing your friendley faces in this amazing hotel and city;5
Iâm a little late writing this review due to the pandemic crisis. I wanted to share that this staff was very helpful, accommodating and made me feel at home. Pil, helped me with my reservation and I canât think him enough. Heâs a rockstar!!  Deff recommend this hotel. Thank you all!!;5
Thanks to the agency and staff who helped pick this hotel! I enjoyed the quick trip! Jermaine was great as expected and we loved our room. Small yet cozy. Breakfast was delightful and we made every day count! Consider using inhouse reservations for convince and more. We would love to return!;5
We stayed 3 nights in March 2012 and had a great time. The staff were all extremely helpful with whatever we needed, don't think I've ever stayed somewhere where I got that much personal attention. The breakfast every morning was delicious, and the one time we had dinner at the Riad it was very good as well (more expensive than what you could find elsewhere but it was nice to stay in and eat at the Riad after a long day of travel). Really loved the terrace up top where you could just relax and take in the views. Overall was a great experience, would definitely stay here again.;5
Stayed here a number of times, staff is friendly, hotel conveniently located.  Even got an upgrade!!  Rhe view was not so great, view of a brick wall.  My fault for mot asking for an upper floor.  Won't stop me from staying here again.;5
Great location for anyone to who wants a central location and not have to use the tube. I went with my family and the 4 of is manage to walk to alot of places from here. Lovely wall at night to soak in the Christmas atmosphere.;5
Everything was perfect. it was Teflon like, perfect.  if i have opportunity, in future, will stay here. room attendants were nice too, provided me extra cream for coffee and decaf items too.  i stayed two nights on 8th floor and was very comfortable bed and tv was quite large, not too large, and quiet rooms as well.;5
What an amazing way to ring in 2013!  I was a little nervous approaching the hotel and seeing a line wrapped around all the way to 62nd St. THANKFUL!  That wasn't my line, as my girlfriends & I bought tickets for the Masquerade Ball in the Lobby Bar area.  VIP service all the way - the manager, Gabriel, was right there to greet us personally & escort us to our table. Lots of good looking people and cool masks.  Our waitress was sweet and kept our drinks full.  AND a photo booth, which we took advantage of!!! Sexy place, good people! Will be back maybe for a cocktail and next NYE!!!;5
Hotel staff were friendly, hotel room was clean with great amenities.  Location was perfect, it was so easy to access all main Hollywood attractions however you would most likely need a car.  Close to the Griffith Observatory and restaurants only a few meters down the road.  Parking around the hotel was also readily available.  Breakfast could be improved.;5
"Made a last minute reservation at this amazingly located hotel. I mean ""amazing"" walking distance to subaway, shopping , bars and restaurants. The room was so comfy (and surprisingly big for NY hotel) the view was right up there with the customer service â­â­â­â­â­ Thank you Cristina (who made my reservation) you did not disappoint!";5
It was a peaceful sleep at the Hollywood hotel. Loved the beds and the quietness of my room. Pil at the front desk is a marvel, not only is he attending guest he also gives them real attention. Thatâs a quality very few posses.;5
Although it was cold in the lobby and the front desk was slow, so what. It is a beautiful hotel from the moment you enter.  You would almost expect Humprey Bogart to be sitting at the bar. It was breath taking. Located on Broadway The Lincoln Center could be seen from my room. The rooms are trendy, beautiful, and very clean...bathroom a little tight but how long does one stay in the bathroom? Bedroom was a generous size for Manhattan and extremely well appointed. The valet service was efficient, the luggage was taken care of, great little restaurant located on site, a comfortable night's sleep and very reasonably priced once they checked for any discount that may apply. Loved it!;5
When trying to decide on a hotel that we have not previously visited, I read the negative reviews first.  The negative reviews for this property are very negative indeed, some of which are so recent that so I considered the Sheraton next door, but it has even worse reviews.  So we stayed at the Hilton.  The Hilton was fine in all respects. The parking valets and the reception clerks were friendly and helpful, as were the waiters, the housekeepers, the parking attendant, basically everyone with whom we came into contact.  The rooms (we booked three) were all fine--clean, well appointed, well laid out, comfortable.  No noise.  The food downstairs was fine. The attendant at the bar was fine.  I am at a loss to understand the recent negative reviews.  It is as if the people were;5
The room was great. We were there for two nights. Bathroom a little small. There were no wash cloths, only towels.  Loved being there.  I was happy for restaurants on premises.  Employees were very friendly.;5
This hotel has such a great New York feel to it and we loved it. When we checked in it was easy, we knew about the facility fee so paying by card was quick and simple to do, and nothing was too much trouble. When we got to the room it wasn't quite what was paid for, but Kristal (apologies if this isn't how you spell your name) changed it with no hassle, getting a member of staff to meet us on our floor with new card keys. I have to say this was a brilliant intro to our stay and it continued. The room was big, great views, clean and while some have mentioned needs updating, I loved the look and feel to the place. The location is great, near Madison Square garden, the metro station, and a 5 minute walk to Macy's. The adjoining Tick Tock diner was great. The doormen were very good;5
Excellent hotel, very clean, modern and great location. Perfect for people looking to get a real NYC experience.  Aside from the hotel itself, other accommodations include the Empire Hotel bar/rooftop which is a sought after hot spot. If you are a guest at the hotel you do not have to wait in line for the rooftop - just present your room keys and you can cut the line.;5
Perfect spot, excellent service, clean and comfortable room. I highly recommend this hotel for a weekend. The staff is very friendly, especially the receptionists. Close to many metro/bus stations. Thanks!;5
The Hollywood hotel is a nice clean hotel to stay which is pretty much my only need when booking a hotel. Brian was very friendly at check in and went above and beyond by even helping me get something to eat at 3 am.;5
Perfect location right across the street from the Opera House. When we had intermission we went back to the hotel to use the bathroom. Lines extremely long in the opera house. With plenty of time to go back and take pictures. Area was nice. The roof top bar was really nice too. Would be perfect for summer time.;5
Rooms were generous...plenty of square footage, and well appointed.  Everything was clean and in good repair.  Beautiful facility.  Check in was easy and self-parking reasonable at $24.00 per day with in and out privileges.  Spaces were large and garage was clean.;5
This is a very nice hotel, good staff and great location. I was here for a business conference. It was perfect for it. There were a lot of families here staying for Universal studios, they seemed really happy. Its a great place for business and vacation;5
The staff was very efficient, friendly and always willing to assist the guests. The room was small but comfortable and the bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. The location was very close to the subway and we could get to various places quickly. The hotel had a restaurant that was open 24 hours a day which was perfect for coming and going at all hours.;5
Love staying at the Empire. Great location. Easy access to convenient shopping and eating. We come here every January. Nice lobby bar.  Next to P J Clarks and Starbucks Across street from Lincoln Center. Really convenient;5
Great staff. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and felt taken care of. Every staff member I encountered went above and beyond to make sure my stay was nothing less than excellent! Looking forward to my next stay at the Hyatt!;5
We had a great stay as we were in town for the opera and the ballet. The hotel is steps from Lincoln Center. Great restaurants and Starbucks are nearby. Central Park is a short walk. We will definitely be back.;5
We needed a hotel near LAX and this property filled the bill. Location was perfect and the room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again.;5
If you want to be close to theater, restaurants, and shopping this is a fantastic location. My room was on the street so it was a little loud but not bad at all. The entire staff was helpful, friendly, and incredibly gracious any time I spoke with them. The room was small but not atypical for a New York hotel room.  The bed was comfortable. The nightstands had plenty of outlets. There was enough room to put clothes away. The bathroom was a reasonable size with a very comfortably sized shower. It was clean and up to date. The internet was a bit spotty but worked way more often than it didnât. This hotel is a great deal. The price is right and it was a very enjoyable stay.;5
I stay at the New Yorker every time I visit New York. I go about two or three times a year. The location is key and a great value for price paid. The staff is great, always helpful and knowledgeable about the area and helped greatly with directions on the subway. The rooms have always been clean and plenty of towels.;5
My husband and i stayed in the hotel for one week from 14th February, 2010.  We felt that the hotel was superb for the price.  Very clean and comfortable.  Staff very helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel.  Very close to everything and easy to get around.  We used the public transport.;5
I stayed in a double queen room.  It was a great size, with nice amenities.  The shower is small, but everything else was wonderful.  The staff was very friendly, the continental breakfast was delicious and the hotel was clean and comfortable.  The pool was also a great place to relax.  We loved the multiple patio areas to enjoy and relax in.  The location wasn't the best, but it was convenient and there were a lot of restaurants in the area.  Only about 2 1/2 miles from the Hollywood attractions.;5
helped me out last min was very great full  ,  pool was clean greate customer service , nice smile greeted me well with respect gym was open , nice room comfortable beds i would suggest you stay here and talk to pil;5
The hilton hotel was fantastic,myself and a friend stayed here in september 2007.   We were met at check in by an amazing group of staff, who were friendly and very helpful. We had booked an executive floor room with two double beds. The room was great very big and clean. The bathroom was spotless and came with amenities, towels  and bathrobes.   Upon arrival the room contained a basket with numerous sweets, fruit etx, which was a nice touch. In the evening the hotel provides a turn down service for executive floor guests, which was pretty cool considering they leave little bags of M&Ms on your pillow :)  Although the room itself was great, the hotel is showing its age, the lobby was a little dated as were the common areas. The lifts were really slow and took there time in;5
I travelled to NYC for the weekend and once again had an excellent experience at the Empire hotel.  The staff were very helpful, the room was clean/spacious, and the location was perfect. I will continue to book at the Empire hotel for both work and leisure.;5
We read the reviews and stayed here for 5 nights paying Â£400 GBP for the privilege which was cheaper than hotels with a worse rating on TA.  For this, breakfast wasnt included and there's only wifi in the lobby (costs extra in the room) but we didn't care for the price.  We visited for a 30th birthday and were greeted with free wine and chocolates which was a nice touch. The bed was SOOOOO comfortable and a decent size. Bathroom had a rainshower and there was a fridge.  Concierge was a gent called Jeff who has been mentioned in previous reviews and he really was fantastic. I don't think we tipped him very well, but he was fantastic with us for the whole 5 nights and can sort anything you need.  The location is perfect. 5 mins to the park, 5 mins to time square and only another 5;5
Don't expect glitz but we prefer it that way. Suites are very good value, especially if you're doing something at Javits center. Restaurants in the hotel (Tick Tock and Trattoria Bianca) dependable and good value.;5
Recommend staying at the Hyatt very clean and friendly atmosphere. Close to the airport  Close to other Hotels Close to the freeway  This was one âð¾ of the nicest hotels Iâve been in in sometime. Very pleased;5
Jerome is extremely helpful and made checking in a great experience. The room is very clean with a beautiful view of the hills and the pool. Having a shuttle to universal is also very convenient.  Ps, heâs very handsome;5
Review of New Yorker â Wyndams Hotel New York My daughter and I stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights following a transatlantic cruise on the Queen Mary 2 In November 2016. Having read some reviews about the hotel I was somewhat apprehensive about our stay but all worries were groundless.  We arrived at 10.00 am and naturally our room was not ready so we checked in and left our suitcases in the secure luggage room for free. I utilised the hotel safe, FOC  for my jewellery. Receptionist was very pleasant and helpful, explaining that we had been given an upgrade and had been allocated a large room with two separate bathrooms. (we had paid extra for single beds and I had written to hotel prior to visit) . Our package included Wi Fi  and gym if anyone has energy to use it.  We;5
My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights as we had tickets for Universal Studios Hollywood. Hotel is ideally located and staff are really friendly. Breakfast was included and has a massive selection that was all very tasty! They provide free water fountains to fill up your bottles which is a feature that should be available in all hotel IMO. Check in and check out was easy. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. The room was really clean as well.;5
My family and I visited the hotel for about 3 days. The service in general was amazing, but our waiter Jose was phenomenal. He was extremely kind, and genuine throughout all of our meals the 3 days we stayed. Very grateful for the kind service. They definitely deserve a 5 star rating;5
This hotel is a very great hotel. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. Very clean rooms as well. Pil was very helpful with us checking in. Came in at the very last minute and they accommodate anything I needed;5
Wonderfully located near Times Square, this cozy hotel is perfect for people who like a quieter lobby. If you're driving in Manhattan, it's an easy drive coming over the George Washington Bridge, off the Henry Hudson Parkway and a left on the 54th street exit,straight down to the hotel. There is a parking garage conveniently situated a 150 feet down the street with special rates for guests of the hotel. Small, clean and comfortable room. Nicely renovated bathroom. Beautiful! Friendly and helpful staff. Almost at the corner of Broadway, The Ed Sullivan Theatre, home of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, is right around the corner. You're right in the midst of things. I'll surely be back!  Thank you for our marvelous stay.  FM;5
I didn't chose this hotel as it was part of a prize won but what a great hotel. 4th visit to NY and 1st time staying in the upper west side. What a fab location. Stayed here for 3 nights with breakfast in a superior room. our room was front facing and yes you could hear the street noise but that did not bother, the view was great and there is something about hearing the car horns that is so NY. The room was modern and of a really good size for NY . Bathroom is tiny, though the shower was a good size and a very good pressure. Breakfast was consistently good with the morning pastries tasting freshly baked and they know how to do scrambled here.... Service in all areas was friendly and always with a smile. Particular mention to Maggie on the reception desk , great first impression;5
We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. Out first impressions were that the hotel appeared to be dated and the room was basic and small. However, we were on floor 36 and had the most amazing views! The hotel is in the most amazing location as it is within walking distance of most tourist attractions. We were out all day and only returned to the hotel to sleep for a few hours before being back up and out sightseeing again. There is a tick tock diner attached to the hotel which we had breakfast in most most mornings and staff were very friendly.  We would recommend the hop on top off bus to get you around the city, pick the right one and it also includes a hop on top off ticket which is great to get to see the statue of liberty.  On reflection we would most;5
This was our third stay at the Hilton - Universal City, so you can already guess that this is going to be a positive review. This is a great hotel and a great place to start a trip to the US or LA.  We made the booking direct with hotel for our two night stay. Communication pre-stay was excellent via text message about our upcoming stay and they notified us that a couple packages had arrived.  Check in and luggage support went really well, especially after coming off an international flight. We had a great room, a King Corner room with a view overlooking Universal Studios.  Near the foyer there is a Peetâs Coffee stall which comes in very handy for that morning coffee! They open from 6am.  There is a complementary shuttle to Universal Studios and Universal Citywalk, but we found;5
We stayed 5 days in Riad Kheirredine. During our stay there is no one thing we can complaint above. Everything was perfect! We travel with small kids age 3 and 5. Even during high season they were able to comfortably accomodate our family. The kids loved it and they always felt so loved and welcomed. Dahlila and Maria were specially helpful and friendly. Here is a list of things we loved .- The service is spotless. Perfect! all the employees there are very well trained and motivated to serve guests. It is really impressive. I have stayed at 5 star hotels and the service here is comparable or better. So kuddos to the managers for keeping such a good coordination and service. .- The mobile phone they loaned us was ver handy. We got lost one or two times during the evening, we;5
Everything ok!   Excellent location, very close to Macyâs, Times Square.    Subway station is on the corner, you can take the bus Across the street.  And very important: front desk staff so friendly!    Absolutely Iâll return to New Yorker Hotel.;5
"We had a great stay at The New Yorker. The staff was friendly, helpful and my requests for a rollaway bed, extra bathrobe and towels were taken care of immediately. The room was spacious (for NYC) and quiet (again for NYC, no hotel can stop the sound of blaring sirens from the street below) clean and tastefully decorated. Our double beds were very comfortable as was the rollaway my daughter slept on. Two closets provided plenty of space for clothing and luggage and separate desk area provided a great spot to drop our purses and bags from the day's shopping without ""cluttering up"" the room. Because there was a large mirror next to the desk, we were also able to use the area as a place for getting ready in the morning while the bathroom was occupied. Bathroom, though small, was";5
This hotel is everything you would expect from a Hilton.  Everyone is friendly and helpful and it is very well ran.  The room had a comfortable bed and pillows, the view was nice.  We booked a room with daily continental breakfast.  The restaurant was very efficient with getting our food out quick so we could proceed with our day, even offered an extra coffee to go.  The shuttle to CityWalk is also handy.  I have nothing negative to say.;5
Iâve been staying at the New Yorker for work for 79 days now for work. Iâve had some pretty rough experiences due to work and life experiences but the day I was able to talk with Neida was AMAZING!!!! She went out of her way to help me and just made my day without even knowing it. She was so professional, sweet and pleasant. It was such a blessing to be able to deal with her. So again I say THANK YOU!!!!! ðððð  -Latasha HeadRN;5
i recently stayed at the Hotel Empire. I travel to NY two weeks per month on business. I usually stay at the Ink 48 or the Beacon and decided to give the Empire a try. From the moment i walked in, i felt wanted, respected and welcomed. Then i met the front desk manager, Daria, who just couldn't do enough to please. She truly cares about every detail and about the hotel that she represents. From the location to the comfortable bed, the lobby and all the amenities, it's worth a look.  Because of the way that Daria treated me, i recommended that my corporate travel department book all who are coming to NY at the Empire.;5
Lovely clean hotel , lovely obliging and helpful staff and first class location, very handy for Time Square, Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens,  the subway and bus station only minutes away if you wanted to go further afield . I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.;5
Spent three nights here with 3 kids.  Rooms were well appointed and we enjoyed the space of a suite.  The rooms were all clean and the hotel provided all you needed.  The location is excellent, in mid town and close to all the main areas visitors like to visit. I personally loved the Art Deco feel to this hotel. Also the TickTock diner is a must for a breakfast or 3 - you'll definitely put on few pounds.;5
Exceeded my expectations. Small room as I am accustomed to in NYC but was so pleased when I got there in terms of cleanliness and comfort. Had a grueling car trip from Virginia and was very tired. Slept very comfortably and very refreshed the next morning.;5
The room at this hotel was very, very, very small. It was just wide enough to fit a queen sized bed. The sink was outside of the bathroom and the bathroom itself was very small as well. That being said it was still very cute and comfortable. The staff were very helpful and nice and the location of this hotel is perfect! Just a 5 minute walk from all major trains, it was great. I would recommend to someone who does not mind being in small room.;5
I chose this hotel for one night because I needed to pick someone up at the airport late at night. The hotel is literally right next to the airport. It offered complementary airport shuttle. The hotel itself is beautiful and the room was clean.;5
When you first approach the riad through Marrakesh's narrow alley ways, you cannot comprehend just how wonderful the riad is actually going to be. It cannot be faulted. It is stunning and the staff are amazing. We loved the wonderful rooftop terrace where you can have breakfast or return in the latter part of the day and sit and watch the sun go down with a glass of wine.  Had it not been winter, I'm sure that we would have taken advantage of the pools. As others have said, the little touches - like free room service of teas and coffees and the free mobile phone and the escort service when you want to go out just make the trip complete.  Nothing is too much for them. The food is excellent - do eat in at least one night. We got quotes for a day trip to go skiing and to visit the;5
We re Visting from San Francisco for the weekend . Really enjoy this hotel the location from downtown/West Hollywood was very convenient . The rooms are spacious and updated. The staff customer service had a high impact on our trip .. Speical thanksgiving is to Daniel going above and beyond to provide us with overnight customers and ( paper clips)  Always a pleasure to stay at Hollywood Hotel;5
Just start my honeymoon in Manhattan west hotel which is very reasonable price to stay in.. For $65/night in NYC.  .private room & bathroom.  Staff were really nice & helpful.  Not included breakfast but in NY,it s totally not a big deal to find something to eat. Just 1 min walk and find Subway for a baqutte breakfast.  Close to Penn station.  Highly recommended if you don't want to spend a lot money for just sleeping.  NYC is not a city to stay inside.;5
Absolutely loved the hotel. Read mixed reviews before we went so was a bit worried but it turned out we had nothing to worry about.  The rooms are massive, the bed is so comfy, the bathroom is amazing and the shower is out of this world. We had a balcony which was nice.  The pool area is lovely and relaxed, very clean and you need your room key to get through the gate so very safe, there's also ample towels in the pool area to use and also a water dispenser. The staff were all lovely and helpful. They have complementary nibbles in the court yard from 5-7pm most evenings which was nice and relaxed. Breakfast is complementary, it was nice but being from England we missed being able to have a brew and bacon etc as it was omelettes and pastrys etc but still nice and served from;5
We had a great time during our 4 nights in this amazing riad. Not far fron the madina, just a few minuts from the garden, and they can arrange you a taxi in case you need that. Thanks much and hope to stay in your riad during our next tine to Marrakech.;5
We have now stayed at the Empire twice. Both times  the service has been exceptional. Rooms were spacious, clean, with beautiful views. Conveniently located near Central Park. We met a kind gentleman named Tommy who was so friendly and went out of his way to make our stay comfortable. Tommy was available to help us with our needs and we now consider him a family friend. Our daughter moved to NY and we now consider the Empire our second home.;5
When arriving at the hotel, you will be greeted by nice/professional valet staff. The lobby is very inviting.  All the workers speak, whether it's someone at the bell desk, tour desk, check in desk or just a staff person walking by.  Check in was fast and precise.  However, the 6 or so elevators are slow reaching the lobby (3rd floor).  I stayed in the alcove room, it was nice with a refrigerator in it. Bathroom was nice and clean, shower was very powerful and the tub was clean.  Linen seemed to be brand new, very crisp sheets.  The bed was very comfortable and the king pillows were plush.  Downsize... no complimentary breakfast but they do have restaurants, however we didn't dine there.  The adult buffet breakfast was $23 per person.  A little over priced when you can go down;5
We stayed during NYFW, it was super busy in the hotel.  The staff was excellent, and treated everyone with respect.  We had a few questions, and they were answered very nicely. We did Valet park our Chevy Traverse which cost us 70.00. It was easy to do, and took that city parking stress away from our trip which we loved!! (Retrieving the vehicle at the end was super smooth as well)  There was a dog show in the hotel, so there were dogs everywhere.  I do have an allergy to them, but it never seemed to bother me.  Our double bed room was super clean, the bathroom was small, but had the antique faucets and door knobs, that took you back in time.  The view out of our window was of the Empire State building , I sat for hours looking at it during the night.  There was noise from the;5
"Can't beat the location of this place--close and walk-able to everything in and around midtown Manhattan.  Although the clientele (on both of my stays here) seems like you are staying in a hostel, this quirky hotel has everything you need, and if you don't have it, just ask for it. Front desk and bellmen were both extremely helpful with my dumb tourist questions, and quick to offer help in booking show tickets and basketball tickets. The single room was relatively small, but the bathroom was quite large, and I loved the ""rainfall"" shower head in the bathroom. I didn't really use the lobby amenities such as breakfast or hanging out using wifi, but I did go to the lobby bar for about 30 minutes my first night there. Other than that, it was mainly just a pit stop on my various";5
We stayed here for 4 nights for my partners birthday and is was great.  The hotel is in a fantastic location  for Broadway and Times Square.  We stayed on the 6th floor, and our room faced onto Broadway. There was some inevitable noise from the street, but wherever you stay in Manhattan you are going to hear sirens and street noise. If you want peace & quiet, you're looking at the wrong city! The room was comfortable, and had everything we needed.  It was cleaned to a high standard, and the bathroom was modern and fitted with an excellent shower.  The staff we encountered were fantastic. They clearly understand what their customers need. From facilitating early check-in, to providing local knowledge, they make this hotel a great experience.  Jeff was particularly helpful and;5
I found out about this hotel from a colleague who had recently stayed that the Empire Hotel in NYC.  I usually stay at the big name hotels and was hesitant to stay here as I thought it was not going to live up to my expectations.  Boy was I wrong.  This is a great little hotel and I will definitely stay there again.  The room, the staff, the bar/restaurant, were all great as was the location.  The price is so much less than other hotels and one of the best deals around.  I will be back!;5
We have now stayed at this hotel twice, both times it was great. Ideally located next to the Lincoln centre, Central Park is within easy walking distance as is Times Square. Friendly staff and roof top bar area along with small but lovely rooms make this an ideal location to stay when visiting New York!;5
Had a very pleasant stay at the Empire hotel. Very convenient location just steps away from everything. Staff is helpful and friendly, front desk agent made an extra effort to accommodate our request. Overall - great value for New York City;5
What a beautiful riad,from the square its a 5or so minutes walk , a good tip my wife marked the walls on our journey out with a lipstick ,it gave us a better chance of not getting lost  from the car park back to the riad. The main square is not so hard to find following your map they give you.The staff are exceptional they are so friendly and helpful . breakfast is  fantastic ,  it will keep you happy for most of the day.all teas, coffees, water ,orange and lemon juice are free any time and will come with snacks .drinks  a bottle of wine 23euro, beer bottle 5euro , but a good wine and tasty beer. out side you will see lots of lads hanging around ,found  no problem with them .in fact everybody we met was friendly even in the souks we weren't pestered. the staff will book taxis;5
Pil is Very professional 10/10 meets guest needs and helps out with guest requests. To all at the Hollywood hotel thanks for a great short stay. Will recommend to all my colleagues. Very impressed overall.;5
Yes, this is an older hotel. My room was clean and comfortable and quiet. It is across the street from Lincoln Center and Fordham Law School and about two blocks from Columbus Circle and Central Park. Pasquale was wonderful at check in, smoothly training a new colleague while being gracious to me and finding me a nice room. Iâve stayed here a number of times and it has always been solid.;5
We were on a trip to California Adventures, and the Hilton was located across the street. A shuttle was available every 15 minutes which worked great with any schedule. The showed me how to use Uber for cheap travel within the city. The rooms were great as usually. I stay in Hilton properties all the time. I have never be disappointed with staff and accommodations.;5
Simply the best hotel I have stayed at for service, quality and luxury.  My booking had to be transferred a couple of times due to the pandemic but each time they were so accommodating. It ended up the holiday was 4 weeks after our wedding and our special holiday honeymoon. Wow did they make us feel special. In the beautiful Safran suite (I recommend). Luck would have it was also my husbands 30th birthday too while we were there. They helped me with surprise balloons and a special cake. So so kind and thoughtful.  We had the best trip, if you are in doubt you must visit this beautiful hotel. The staff are incredible, the service is 110/100. And the kindness and helpfulness is something Iâll never forget. We will be back. P.s I love a hotel breakfast and this was one of the best.;5
Great Hotel, Amazing Buffets and Perfect Location.  Right across the street from Universal Studios. The restaurant buffet was amazing.  The Seafood and Prime Rib Buffet on the weekend was massive. Great pool with a pool side bar with menu service. I loved the Koi pond and the two turtles.;5
"I went to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden last week and we wanted the full experience. After seeing what was around, we found The New Yorker was not only on the opposite corner of The Garden, but also part of one of our hotel rewards programs.    The hotel is in a 40 story building that was built in 1931.  All the rooms have been completely refurbished but you still get a little of the nostalgia of the older hotels.  When we went, it was âFleet Weekâ so the hotel was crawling with Navy and Marines ; some of whom were actually part of the concert with Billy Joel.   While the lobby was full of guests, visitors and other, check in was fairly easy.  The check-in /front desk associateâs name was Driss.  He found out we were part of the rewards program and upgraded our room to";5
We found Riad Kheirredine on Trip Advisor, and booked our stay there because of the great reviews. In short, the reviews are spot on: Riad Kheirredine is a gem in the medina, and its staff are gracious and generous beyond expectation.  The experience started at the airport, where we were greeted by our driver. The final 150 meters or so of alleyways do not accommodate cars, so at that point our luggage was transferred to a handcart, and the staff brought it the rest of the way. Ismail greeted us at the hotel's front door, and we were treated to traditional Moroccan hospitality: mint tea, dates and apricots were served while he enquired about our journey to Marrakech and showed us around the riad.  The medina is a twisty maze of streets and alleys, and it is quite easy to get;5
My wife and I stayed at the Americana Hotel for our 25th wedding anniversary.  I spoke to Yassin on the phone about our special day.  Yasmin went above and beyond making or stay so enjoyable.  Jeff greeted us at the door with a big smile and when Jeff saw us waiting for our room he offered to get us tea or coffee.  That has never been done in all the hotels we have stayed in.  Check out was simple room was spotless  Read some reviews that they hear some outside noise at night.  People it is New York City the place never sleeps but you will like a baby in there great beds. Came home and booked for Thanksgiving 2017  That is how great our stay was.  Yasmin and Jeff Thanks again  Mike Geldmacher;5
I Stayed at the Ameritania for a total of 3 nights. When conducting business in NY I usually stay in other hotels however these were booked out. As an emergency option I chose the Ameritania.  I was very pleasantly surprised, the hotel has a great central location in Manhattan, the rooms are very clean and nicely furnished. The best thing about the hotel is the staff working there, they turn a good Hotel into a fantastic experience with their friendliness, passion and drive. From now on I will make the Ameritania my first choice when staying in NY.;5
Absolutely would recommend the Empire Hotel if you're looking for a fun rendezvous near the Park.  We booked the Junior suite and it was a large room, more than fulfilled our needs.  It is also phenomenal location! a block from central Park and Columbus circle.  We will be back for sure.;5
The staff make the hotel so great!  The room was tired and outdated. But the rest of the hotel was amazing, very clean, pretty and secure. And the staff were absolutely amazing. It's a pity the restaurant was closed since the pandemic. But we would highly recommend!;5
I stayed in the empire with my partner a couple of years ago. The review may be a little late but worth a read.  The location of the empire is perfect for anyone that wants to stay in central Manhattan but away from the hustle and bustle of the main attractions. The hotel is in walking distance of EVERYTHING!   Right next door to the empire is Starbucks. Right across the street (50 metres) is the Bank of America. I would recommend this bank of European travellers similar to myself as it has the lowest charges for transactions. The empire hotel is a 5-7 minute walk from Central Park, a 3-4 minute walk to the closest subway, 7-10 minute to Columbus square and a 15 minute walk to 5th avenue.   The hotel staff are so friendly and super helpful. When we stayed we got to know a door;5
Great hotel!! I have stayed here 4 times now. Very central and only a short walk away from times square. The rooms are spacious and we got upgraded to a slightly bigger room on our last visit my only problem was there was only one bathroom previous rooms I have stayed in had 2 bathrooms. It has the added benefit of the Tick Tock diner cant recommend it enough great food at great prices!! The restaurant/bar is very good the cocktails are amazing and the staff very friendly.;5
located in the heart of the stars.  love the view directly across form universal studios amusement park and city walk of restaurants and shopping.  Also in the center of the newest downtown los angeles.;5
We stayed at the Empire Hotel again this year over the Christmas holiday. It is located right near Central Park, close to great shopping, and a walk or short cab ride to see a play or ballet or opera and so many great museums. The most attractive part of the Empire is the fantastic location. Running in first place is also the cleanliness of this hotel for a NYC hotel in the $200 a night price range. We were able to shop around and find a great deal on the room rate that left us with some extra money for the parking. We found parking about a block away for $30 a day. Bottom line, Great Location and Clean and Great Deals Available online.;5
We stayed on the recently refurbished 30th floor. Couldnât recommend the hotel more! Great location, staff & amenities. We were staying in a suite the 4 of us, not the easiest to clean, & room was left spotless everyday. The view from our room was also brill, right across from the Empire State! The history of the hotel is also fascinating, well worth going to the basement floor to read about!;5
We arrived at the Wyndham New Yorker which was only 1 min walk away from Penn Station. (We got the air train then the Long Island Railroad from JFK). We got booked in, which just to let people know they put a hold charge on a card, they did ask for credit card but they accepted our debit.   We went to our room which was the wrong room but they immediately changed it when we rang reception and said we had paid for a metro room view, then we went to our second room and oh mY!!!  The view was absolutely amazing. We emailed a few weeks before requesting a Empire State room ( which we knew we wouldn't definitely get but there was no harm in asking!) and we did get a view of the Empire State! AND Chrysler building AND Madison square garden!    The room was spotless, towels and;5
Stayed here with a friend first week in December. Swift check in. Door man very helpful when he brought our bags up to the room. Helped us with booking tickets and where everything is. Hotel is a short distance from Times Square, 5th Avenue, Central Park and is right on Broadway.  Perfect location.  Helpful and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
Empire is an fabulous hotel. The location is terrific and the rooms are beautifully appointed. Also, the staff is wonderful, most especially Sharde! She is helpful and thoughtful and always willing to spend the time to ensure you are treated well. Thank you Sharde and the rest of the Empire team!;5
My stay at the Wyndham New Yorker was very pleasant. Although the hotel was very busy and the lobby was cold (record sub-zero temps outside, so their wasn't much they could do), the level of service was exceptional and the room was very nice. As busy as the hotel was and the streets outside, my room was amazingly quiet.  The location, right next to Madison Square Garden is right in the heart of Manhattan, a very easy walk to Times Square, Empire State....  Their computer had a glitch and accidentally double charged my credit card. At first, I was very frustrated and intended to leave a negative review. However, as soon as I let them know, I was quickly contacted by the Director of Operations. He was very apologetic, courteous and quickly refunded me the overcharge plus some;5
The single rooms are tiny.  The beds are smaller than a twin size bed.  There is space to store your luggage (shelf above the bed, large drawers and space below the bed).  The hotel and room was impeccably clean.  The carpet in the room was impeccably clean (a pet peeve of mine as my feet are sensitive).  The hallways and entire hotel was impeccably clean and extremely elegant.  The staff  (all of them) were nice, cool, and friendly.  I arrived at 10AM to store my luggage as check-in time is 3PM.  The hotel desk checked me in early.  I was very pleased right away.  Another plus on check in was the complementary bottle of wine they give you.  I am not a drinker, but it is a super nice touch.  I asked for a quiet room and they gave me room 420, which was very quiet.  The shared;5
Came for a break from our two small children for 4 nights and apart from not having a bath (our fault for not checking - not theirs) there was literally nothing even remotely negative to say about Valentina and her team.  The room was turned down twice a day. Water, drinks and snacks were on tap and always offered. We were walked into the main square on our first visit and given things to look out for along the way to help us. We were collected in person from the airport and dropped off in the same fashion. We had dinner there on the first night and was super tasty. The team were remarkably attentive.  We would absolutely go back if visiting Marrakech again and tbh it's tempting to do so...  GO AND STAY HERE...;5
I remember this building when it was the nurse's home for Charing Cross Hospital, and so wasn't expecting much as it was a terrible place back in the 80s!  But I was surprised, it's now a great place. Clean and well-maintained, comfy beds, a fridge in the room, and kitchens and showers just across the hall. We have stayed in hostels across Europe, and I have to say this is one of the best. The location in central hammersith is perfect, its a quiet side street but just a couple of hundred metres from the tube. Will definitely stay here again : );5
This trip was booked for us by my partner's parents to celebrate his 30th birthday. The hotel was everything we had hoped it would be and more. We were upgraded on arrival to a junior suite as the travel agent (partner's sister) had informed the hotel that it was to celebrate a birthday, and had champagne on ice waiting in the room. The suite was much larger than I had anticipated after reading Trip Advisor reviews and had a sitting room area, huge bed, wardrobe, large mirror, shower and bath, umbrella to borrow in the wardrobe, mini bar, magazines etc. We weren't wanting for anything.   The lobby bar and rooftop bar are obviously hotspots and were very lively at night time, this suited our stay down to the ground and once we were in the room had no noise disturbance (other than;5
Thais hotel is really nice! The staff are so good and helpfull. Its a great experience at NY. The location is perfect, really nice to enjoy theaters and good restaurantes. Enjoy NY at Ameritania Hotel!!!!;5
Just off Broadway and steps from Lincoln Center, this hotel is in a perfect location for restaurants, culture and quick access by subway or bus to uptown and downtown destinations.  A small park across the street from the hotel entrance means that there is not as much traffic outside the door.  Hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful and we found Ed's Chowder House on the mezzanine level to be the perfect spot for a late afternoon snack and drink at the bar.  I stayed here for the weekend with my 2 daughters for an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was just a short cab ride away.  We also took the subway down to Soho for shopping and the bus to the Times Square Area. The decor is snazzy, with dark walls and animal print accessories on the lounges in the lobby.;5
"Myself and my now fiancÃ©e :-) yes we got engaged in new York, have just returned after having an amazing time! Hotel is perfectly placed away from the hustle and bustle of time square but only a 2min walk from the subway station; which gives you easy access to the rest of Manhattan. Subway is so cheap to use unlike the taxis which can be expensive. Also Central Park is a 5 min walk and the hotel overlooks the Lincoln Centre. We arrived at the hotel to find out our room had been upgraded to a king size deluxe room! Reception staff were extremely helpful and polite as were all the staff we came into contact with at the hotel.  Our room was amazing with an excellent view of the Lincoln centre. The room came with a fully stocked mini bar and also tea and coffee facilities. These";5
The hotel is very comfortable with exception staff and the best location you could wish for.  It is right near Penn Station.  Very close to Macy's and Statue of Liberty.  It is also an easy walk to Times Square and right near Madison Square Garden;5
"Our family of four, visited Universal Studio for first time. At check in, we are told the hotel was full & since we booked our 2 rooms months in advance, we received an upgrade. The kids got the park view room with 2 queens - overlooking Harry Potter World & we got the corner suite (1 king).  The corner suite was huge with spa-like bathroom. Staff was courteous; linens & amenities was superb.  We love that it was only a short 5-minutes walk via pedestrian bridge and we're at the entrance to the Universal Studio park. The rooms were quiet and was one of the nicer hotels we've stayed.";5
Second time staying at this hotel and if we return would stay there again. While a little pricey we found it to be worth the money. The room was clean and modern, the staff was polite and helpful,  the food was above average and the location was convenient. Overall a great experience;5
Cynthia and Elias at the front concierge were a massive help and after stressing out for the start of our trip, they have taken a big weight off of our shoulders.  Not only did they make check in easier, they made us feel so welcome, relaxed and ready for the rest of our stay in LA!   The room is big and spacious, has a large TV, the bathroom is super clean - honestly couldn't praise the place and the staff enough! Would highly recommend staying here if you want a home away from home (-:;5
After we got scared by another run downed hotel we walked into the Hollywood hotel and it was a paradise. At the front desk Pil did not hesitate to save us from our dilemma. Very friendly and professional.   The hotel provides its guest with a full breakfast which is a big surprise in todayâs hospitality practices. We literally had a chef fresh cook us omelets and a waffles of different sizes. BIG PLUS.   But the biggest selling point is how safe the hotel made is feel. 24 hour front desk help. And at night you need your key to come into the hotel the doors donât open automatically. For 2 young females enjoying Hollywood safety is important and the Hollywood made us feel just that.   Will be coming by many more times to share my experience. Thanks Pil you are truly a legend.;5
Very nice hotel for the meeting we attended. Very conveniently situated to Universal Studios with a free shuttle to City Walk.  Rooms were elegant and spacious. We had a little fun at Universal Studios, too!;5
We found this hotel at 3am  in the morning after getting messed around with in our other hotel.   The staff here were amazing so so friendly and amazing. They helped us find a room and then told us where everything around town was.   The room was clean and huge great for 2 males who have a lot of baggage    I will be refuting this hotel to friends and family for sure;5
Very well located and nice quality. The breakfast was good, except for the coffee! I recommend the twin room, the beds were really big, almost two meters of bed for each. I highly recommend the hotel.;5
It was absolutely perfect from the beginning until the end. It was such a warm and friendly atmosphere that is really exceptional. Even after thinking it over after our return to Germany, there is nothing we found to complain about.;5
Stayed here for 3 nights. Rooms are a little on the small side but didnt bother us as we were out most of the day anyway. The views of the empire stat building were outstanding and the was very comfortable, and shower very good too. What more could you ask for?;5
I stayed here with my kids for a week , what a great time we had. The staff were very helpful and friendly and even helped us out when my sons luggage lock couldn't be opened. We loved the rooftop pool ! Bedrooms were very clean and was cleaned everyday ! Snacks were over priced in the room but you don't have to eat them! Just bring in your own, problem solved.Also thank good for the air con, was a godsend!  Our first holiday in America was made even better by staying at the Empire. Would  definitely stay here again ð;5
"The Empire is a gem of a hotel without being super expensive. We love the location, it feels nice and open and neighborhoody. That is partly due to a small park in front of the hotel and its quiet front street. The beautiful, adjacent, Lincoln Center adds to the open feel. Close to the central park, easy subway access, wonderful location for getting to see shows via subway while staying in a nice, safe, clean neighborhood; also great choices of restaurants. At the hotel the rooms have nice windows, are super clean, of midern design, very comfortable beds/bedding, and the friendliest bellman around! They send you off for your with a smile. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in this price range!";5
I stayed for 5 nights in June and the staff were absolutely great, its a pretty good location, I felt safe walking home from the bar at night despite what everyone says. The room was clean and tidy, with very friendly cleaners. The breakfast Buffet is great, fresh omelettes are a winner! Qantas lost my baggage and the staff were kind enough to take the time to take a photo of a similar suitcase that I had bought from there little shop too help for my lost baggage claim.  Thanks Guys!;5
This was my first time ever in New York. I went to celebrate my birthday and wanted to stay close to my bus drop off location and the New Yorker was one of the hotels that popped up. I thought the location was fantastic and everything for the most part was within walking distance. The hotel history appealed to me greatly as well. My stay was beyond amazing and would very much do it again in the future.;5
Stayed at this hotel again excellent friendly service throughout will stay again great position as well with there own restaurants in the building. Trattoria with there varied menu from pizza to steaks tick rock diner with it's great breakfast menu open 24/7 and the service is great but make sure your hungry when going there also try the orio and cream shakes there to doe for.;5
Our stay at Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City was made a little more grand because of excellent service from Mr. Jerome.  He made sure we recieved all the bells and whistles that Hilton had to offer during our stay. Thanks for that.;5
We were only there for two days, but the experience was wonderful.  We asked for a room with a view.  We had the view of the San Fernando Valley and of Universal Studios.  It was beautiful and definitely worth the little extra money.  There is a shuttle that takes you to City Walk from 9am-10pm.  We wanted to leave earlier than 9am so we walked a short walk across the street to Universal Studios.  You just need to cross over the bridge and you are practically there.  There was a buffet inside the hotel that seemed very popular.  We did not try it because it was mainly seafood and kind of pricey, but for what they seemed to serve may have been priced correctly.  Instead of the buffet we tried the coffee place they have next to it.  It serves Starbucks coffee and the regular;5
Once again I decided to visit NewYork City during the Holiday season....Despite the cold I could not ask for a better more festive and Christmas spirited place to be! I stayed at one of my favorite NYC hotels Empire and yet again it did not fail! I absolutely love this boutique hotel and have never had anything but the BEST treatment and service here! You cannot beat or ask for a better location! And the staff as usual went above and beyond to ensure my week stay was a great one! Thank you to Zunachy Garica, Nick Brown and Daniel Reyes for making me feel at home and for going above and beyond the call of duty to make sure I was comfortable. Stress free and happy ! Exceptional staff ....exceptional location and cool chic decor will be the reason I continue to make this hotel my;5
From the moment we arrived till the moment we checked out we were treated fantastically , staff couldnât do enough for you , room was immaculate and a great bathroom and with tons of fluffy towels . This will be our go to hotel whenever visiting New York from now on . Huge thanks to Belkis who went above and beyond for us;5
The Jane is an historic hotel in the Meatpacking District. With a colourful history it has been renovated but still retains its charm. Rooms are small but good value and it feels like a great New York experience in a great location.;5
My wife and I stayed at the Hilton in late August during our 30th anniversary wedding trip. What a great experience! The location was perfect for us (15 minute drive to most attractions, plus City Walk), and the staff was outstanding! I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and i look forward to our next visit.;5
We chose this hotel for its proximity to Universal Studios/ Harry Potter World, and were very pleased by how convenient it was. We did not use the pool, but wish we had brought swimsuits, so we could have. The room was lovely, clean, with all conveniences. The cost of the breakfast buffet was very high, so we ate only one meal there.  We found plenty of good choices for dining on the nearby City Walk.;5
From the time you pull up to the New Yorker... it is service with a smile. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. The rooms are pleasant and housekeeping is always close by for assistance. To me, the showers are the best part of the room. Strong, forceful, hot and relaxing.;5
"This hotel is a perfect location for Central Park, access to the subway, and in our case, our children!  The highlight of our stay (and near disaster) was that I left my checkbook in the room safe; not realizing the oversight until arriving back in Minnesota.  I called security, and Jeremy promptly went to the room and recovered the check book (with cash, credit card, health insurance cards, and more).  My son picked it up after work and Fedexed it to me with everything intact.  Thanks so much to Jeremy!  My only criticism is the lack of a shower door in the shower, and a broken (unstable) spray wand.  Hard to keep the water in the designated area!";5
Service was excellent. Very conveient to the subway and walking distance to Universal Studios. Rooms were very clean and the buffet was excellent but pricey. My choice when staying in LA. Parking was steep $17.00 a day for self parking.;5
This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. Nowhere near as big as some of the hotels near Times Square that weâve stayed in and all the better for it. Rooms were a really good rate and location wise thereâs a subway stop right nearby, itâs walking distance to Times Square and thereâs a sports bar right next door. We paid a small upgrade fee for a more premium room and were rewarded with a higher floor (little traffic noise to be heard) and a corner room that was larger than the norm with three windows letting in a lot of extra natural light. Great size, including the bathroom. Comfortable bed. The huge full length mirror was much appreciated. Hotels so often lack those. We didnât make use of any of the other facilities bar the complimentary tea and coffee on offer every morning.;5
We stayed for six nights in a captains cabin. We had an unobstructed view of the Hudson River and sunsets were magnificent. The highlights....the best pillows of any place we have stayed. The showers are as good as you will get anywhere. The whole place reeks history, and we were happy to go along for the ride. Cafe Cittadines is a treat and a great place to watch the passing parade. The location of The Jane is perfect. Stay long enough and you will start to feel a part of the local community. The front of house staff are welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable. The downsides....household staff appear to be under pressure and our room was not serviced until after 4.30 most days. Quality of servicing was patchy and inconsistent despite daily tipping. i feel that Household staff are;5
I've stayed at this boutique hotel twice and enjoyed both stays. The rooms are on the smaller end but very functional, clean, & comfy. No complaints. Close to Broadway and within 10 min from Madison Square Garden. I would definitely stay again.;5
I know all the reviews say it's great. It can't possibly be as good as ALL these people say, right?  Yeah, it really is. It's difficult to put into words the standard of service Riad Kheirredine offers. We arrived at night and were dropped in the middle of a street somewhere, cars can only go so far. There were loads of people hanging around and for a tourist it's a little intimidating. BUT, we were immediately met by a guy who put our bags into a trolley and asked us to follow him to the Riad. After a short walk through the narrow, atmospheric alleyways, we reached a simple door which opened out into a calm, beautifully candle lit courtyard. We were sat down, given mint tea and told exactly how things worked here. It was our ten year anniversary and they had put rose petals and;5
This hotel was amazing and was so because of the PHENOMENAL help we received from Brian at the front desk. We checked in very late at night with what we soon found out was an incorrect reservation, and he could not have been more helpful getting us a new room and making us feel comfortable. 6 stars for great service, thanks Brian!;5
Amil was a great concierge. Excellent service and great room! Plenty of space and the bed was extremely comfortable. There's also plenty of space in the Bathroom and shower. Definitely check this place out!;5
Everyone was very friendly and helpful, Sleeping accommodations was nice The attached restaurant ( TIC TOCK ) was excellent. The view of New York  from our room was excellent, The only thing needed was Valet.;5
"The location was perfect for the amount of time my family of ten wanted to spend on our VIP tour of Universal Studios. The entire staff was friendly, helpful & courteous from our entry to our exit. I can truly say, ""The aloha spirit dwells there!"" Go and see for yourself.";5
"Having traveled the world extensively for personal & business, I've never been treated like ROYALTY as I was by the exceptional, 2nd-to-none, staff at Riad Kheirredine. Like another reviewer said, we were treated even better than Anna Winters personal assistant or any royal family concierge treat their royalty!  And this started a month before we even arrived, receiving a welcoming invite from the Concerige ""queen"", Sarah.  We were coming to Marrakech for the 1st (& now not the last!) time & had only 3 days to see it ""all"".   Sarah was remarkable ~ overwhelmingly responsive, kind, insightful, resourceful, brilliant, patient, attentive & took so much time with me (email & phone) to plan a phenomenal Itinerary packed to include every hot spot, adventure, experience, lunch, dinner";5
We stayed 3 nights here but would've loved to have stayed longer. Great location, clean room very cheap rate and our room was ready before check in time which was great because we were pretty tired the staff was great and very helpful they helped us get around new York city and print out tickets through their PC. The metro station is just 3 streets away, and the train takes you to the center off time square I will definitely be coming back to Morningside hotel, had a great stay!;5
I can't say enough about this terrific hotel. The staff is incredibly welcoming, especially Nick, at the front desk, who gave us a room with an amazing view and saw to it that our every need was met. The rooms themselves are clean, modern, and comfortable, with great beds and linens. Yes, they're on the small side, but this is NYC, people, what do you expect? The hotel has a wonderful location--a block away from Central Park, Lincoln Center, and Columbus Circle. Subway line is right there. Whole foods, Starbucks, and Duane Reade right downstairs. Would stay again in a heartbeat!;5
Pil at the front desk not only allowed me to do an early check-in, he also upgraded my room! As a solo female traveler, I felt incredibly safe and welcomed at the hotel, which was a very quick subway train ride away from all the big Hollywood and Downtown LA attractions. My hotel room was gorgeous and mustâve been recently refurbished because it seemed a lot newer than the hotel actually is. Very clean and comfortable room, many amenities and excellent staff. Definitely booking at this hotel next time I visit!;5
We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights with our two teenage sons. We had a wait for checkin when we arrived as it as busy, but we got a free upgrade on one of our rooms so our boys room was near ours. We stayed on the 7th floor, the rooms were  very clean and had tea & coffee facilities. The staff were very helpful and the tick tock diner is good for breakfast, the triattori bianca Italian restaurant is superb for just a drink (happy hour 12-6.30pm) and the food is fantastic. Itâs the location of the hotel that is the best, itâs centrally located to most of the things you want to see when staying in New York. We had tickets to watch the New York Knicks on the Saturday evening, we were literally across the road from Madison Square Gardens! We would definitely stay at the New;5
The best location and close to a very good restaurant and the metro. Recommended 100% for its excellent facilities and friendly staff. Ideal for family and business. We would definitely book this hotel again.;5
We can confidently re-iterate all the positive feedback from previous reviews which we used as a basis for booking our stay.  The riad, the rooms, the pool, the sun terrace and breakfasts are fantastic.  Above all the people and customer service is excellent.  Yajaira, Valentina and all their staff are great, for us with all their friendliness, assistance and helpful advice make what would be a great stay anyway, into a fantastic experience. We travelled with out 2 daughters (11 & 15) and stayed in the Jasmine suite.  Although this is arranged over three floors the addition of our own terrace was a bonus.  Without repeating many of the other comments, some additional points you might find useful are: - the desert tour organised for us was fantastic and allowed us to experience;5
The perfect location. Choice of tubes within five minute walk. Westminster over the bridge. London Eye next door. Simply couldn't pick a better location. Prices you won't find anywhere else in central London and the Premier Plus rooms are excellent.   Fantastic service, breakfast lovely too. Will definitely be back;5
We had a great time here at the hotel we were impressed. We received a king bed room and it was very spacious. Facing the courtyard and just a decent room to enjoy. Coffee, tea, extra bed, towels, tooth paste, and more all delivered when ask.   The pool is great could be bigger but great, used the sauna a few times it was sweet. Snack shop in there was a great thing to have wish it had better hours. Vending and laundry on site as well.   Great service we were helped by great guy Jermaine and he was pretty confident in the information provided and he was thorough with the info.   Didnt try the breakfast but one day while there and might we say it was good but the gentlemen there was rude about write me and mention me on trip advisor and please tip and etc. Not a great way to make;5
Had a great visit to the Empire.  Super location if you need to be in the Lincoln Center area.  Got caught in the winter storm that hit NY. Front desk staff was fantastic, especially Helena.  Found  a room for me early (which after 24 hours of travel was a blessing).  Free internet with a strong connection, which was great to get work done.;5
We got a great price for this hotel. Had a great check in experience. I watched the hotel manager in operation and he was uber efficient. We will definitely be going back to this hotel.   There is a free shuttle to the parks. Parks are only a 5 minute walk. Hotel offers a free fridge and there is a Ralph's supermarket close by.  We were given free wifi without asking ( i know this is small, but its still a nice touch).   Gym well equipped, clean rooms, staff everywhere.  Thank you for a great stay;5
My room was small, but nicely decorated and well maintained. My room faced the street, and was on the noisy side at night. There was always a person on duty to see room cards before anyone could get on an elevator.;5
In a luxury hotel market dominated by a few big chains Riad Kheirredine shows that luxury doesn't have to mean boring conformity.  Everything about the place is outstanding: comfort, care, food, drinks, location, I could rave on...and on.  What really makes Riad Kheirredine so different is its standard of service: everything is done with warmth, professionalism and care.  We would like to thank Valentina, the joint GM, and her team for making our stay so memorable.  Bravo!;5
My wife and I stayed at The Ameritania in December 2017 for a week and had a great stay. The room was smallish, but I expected that in NYC and it was very comfortable. The bar, door and reception staff were excellent, making us feel very at home for our entire stay. The hotel was ideally placed for Times Square, 5th Ave, 6th Ave and Central Park to name a few, with easy access to the subway. There are some great bars and restaurants around too. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.;5
Have stayed at this hotel every time our family decided to take a trip to Universal Studios.  Can not beat the location.  Very short walk to Universal or you can wait for the hotel shuttle that runs every 15 mins or so.  The concierge is fabulous.  Tried to book tickets for a Beverly Hills tour which was sold out for our group of 10.  Since we had a large group the concierge recommended a private limo tour as it would actually be cheaper than the tour bus and we could determine the route we wanted to take.  Our limo driver was fabulous and very knowledgeable.  The rooms are a little on the warm side and do not cool down as much as I would like but this is not a deal breaker for me.;5
The room was spotless!! The location was really convenient, close to Westminster, London eye, underground satiations, bus stations! Restaurantes in front the hotel . The staff was very nice and helpful!;5
Come here for the service. Marrakech is a busy crazy place with people soliciting you constantly.  This Riad is a welcome oasis where the staff (it's like a 1:1 ratio) is super happy, friendly, and insistent on helping you.  No charge for anything.  Everything is included in the high room rate so you don't have to worry about people trying to upsell.  The service is super personal.  My favorite place to be in morocco.  I had some trouble booking a bus ticket online, so they sent someone to go buy them for me in person!  Do be prepared.  It is hard to find this place an easy to get lost in the medina.  But the hotel staff will do everything possible to make sure you don't get lost.;5
Perfect site and just a great and luxury looking hotel! Amazing service by Pil who helped my wife and I check in on such a rushed evening after a long travel from the Bay Area. Would recommend it 1,000% and stay here again next time I visit LA and Itâs areas!;5
My 16 year old son and I stayed at the Hilton for four days at the end of a 2 week trip to the USA visiting East, Central and Western states.  ARRIVAL: We arrived in a pre-booked taxi from Anaheim and the door staff were opening the car doors and greeting us before we even realised we had stopped at the entrance.  Check-in was swift, efficient and friendly and we were in our room within 5 minutes of arrival. ROOM: We had a superb executive level room with fantastic views out across Universal Studios and the surrounding hills.  Lots of space, supremely comfortable beds and pillows and a large luxury bathroom. Everything was spotlessly clean and the air-conditioning kept it cool and comfortable. Wireless hook up for the laptop was really simple and not too expensive. FOOD: A;5
The Morningside Inn has received such mixed reviews that we were pretty anxious about our week-long stay there. We needn't have worried. We arrived a day later than usual (due to Air India no longer using JFK) and late at night.   Patrick meet us on arrival and told us that our original room had been let as the travel company hadn't informed him of new arrival date. He was very pleasant and helpful, putting us in an ensuite room (we'd originally booked a budget room with shared bath) telling us to get some sleep and relax and that the room situation would be sorted out the next morning. As it turned out we were allowed to remain in the room and no extra charge which was perfect.   Okay, the Morningside isn't the poshest hotel in NY but it was clean and  the staff were  friendly;5
The receptionist was so welcoming.  The hotel is centrally located and very clean.  We also love that the Tic Toc is right there for meals.  The room was spacious.  We didn't have a refrigerator which would be nice.;5
I found this hotel by coincidence on the hotels.com website. What a wonderful surprise! A small boutique style hotel, with a European atmosphere. Beautiful marble lobby and corridors, a spacious clean room, a charming inner courtyard with exotic plants and comfortable benches to sit and read, or sip a glass of wine.A nice pool (which we did not use, because it rained!!! when we were there). A great buffet breakfast in the tastefully decorated clean and cheerful dining room, with an omelet station every day! The front desk people and the cleaning crew were equally friendly and helpful. Also the location was perfect for us, close to Hollywood, but right in the hustle and bustle, also convenient commute for USC graduation down on Vermon tAve. Thank You!;5
staying in the jane is like being in a train car from the 20's. everything is wood and marble, the bathroom, though shared is clean and glamorous. the restaurant downstairs does the room service....and it is incredible food. the vibe is young, hip and boutique. the night club in the lobby is my favorite spot in nyc for having a dance and drink. great dj. the location is 2 blocks from the standard hotel in the meat packing. i love this hotel, truely;5
We came to Marrakech to celebrate my partners birthday in February and could not have chosen a better place to stay. The welcome and staff are FANTASTIC. Nothing was too much trouble, making reservations, cancelling reservations, snacks for late night arrivals, constant delicious refreshments, flowers, birthday cakes, care, love and medicine when one of us fell ill. Breakfast on the roof terrace is magical with the snow covered Atlas mountains in the distance. We stayed in three different rooms (our choice!) and all had their charm. The journey too and from the riad is a delight and you get the real flavour of the place with all the colours, sounds and smells. Thank you Yajaira, Elena and all the staff who made our stay so memorable and pleasurable.;5
I thought I had booked the hotel for last minute night and turns out I never completed the reservation. Empire Hotel employee Luis was so nice and worked to get us a room anyway. We were exhausted and appreciated the great service. Room clean and comfortable.;5
We had originally booked to go to Marrakech in November last year, however, then Morrocco closed their borders. So, I rebooked for March once things opened up again for my Husbands birthday.  I had already decided I wanted to stay at Riad Kheirredine last year, I'd spent hours researching ....and am so pleased we chose this beautiful riad. You will not regret choosing this wonderful place!     We had a fabulous times here, the riad is amazing, peaceful and clean.  The staff are superb and so helpful. All of them were lovely, Arjane, Siad, Safae, Amal, Elena, Sara, Brahim, Yassine, Aymane and Ilyass....who we taught about making the perfect British pot of tea!!!   They even organised a cake for my husband on his birthday.  And the food....absolutely delicious.  So much so we ate;5
Diamond provided exemplary customer service during our call. She was able to think outside the box and help solve a unique problem.  Diamond was compassionate and understanding to the circumstances and swiftly provided a solution.  Thank you for the wonderful service!;5
"I often choose the NEW YORKER HOTEL because it is across from NY Penn Station and on the subway lines to convenient parts of the city.  It is a booming hotel in that crowds of tourists seem always to be checking in and checking out; which makes it interesting and fun. Built to the high standards of pre-war construction, this classic Art Deco hotel remains worthy of its history.";5
I'd like to say a huge THANK YOU to Majid, who was very respectful and understanding, he helped us find what we were looking for and i couldnt thank him enough! He even gave us recommandations of where to eat and what we must see!!   From Julien.A;5
Great location, about 5 minutes from Columbus Circle, or Lincoln Centre Stations. Easy access to local shops, bars, restaurants and Central Park. The room we had was actually spacious and met our needs. It was a little dark, but more than ample for our stay. The Rooftop bar was nice, and drinks at a reasonable price. I would stay there again if I was in NYC again. Thanks Empire.;5
The Riad is absolutely outstanding in every respect. The staff, the setting, the decoration, the food, the care, the smell!  The staff take such good care of you, helping you understand how to have a great time inside the Riad and outside in marrakech. They are all good fun and chatty, yet very professional. We were given a guide to help us find our way round the city, recommendations for what to see and where to dine.  The breakfast on the terrace is delicious and beautiful, and the whole experience was so memorable. The Riad and the rooms are stunning and unique.   We had waited 2 years to come to Morocco due to covid, and there was a minor issue with our booking but the team went above and beyond to rectify this - we were upgraded to the imperial suite which was stunning, and;5
I have finally been to NYC! That's one thing to check off my bucket list. I booked a trip for myself and 3 girlfriends to fly to NYC and stay at the Empire Hotel for 3 nights. I used tripadvisor a lot to help me decide where to stay. You really need to look at traveler's photos when decided on a hotel. With that said, the Empire Hotel exceeded every expectation. The location of the hotel was fantastic. We were able to get on the subway close to the hotel, and we were only 2 stops away from Times Square. Sometimes, three stops. It depends on which way you go to get on the subway. The hotel rooms are beautiful, as well as the hotel itself. The front desk staff were amazing. They were very happy to give us directions and great NYC tips. We had a great time sightseeing and;5
Very clean, nice toiletries, plenty of clean towels, helpful doormen, free wi-fi in the lobby, great location for walking to theater, restaurants, movie and the park - we like to walk good distances so did not need a cab for 4 days. Don't miss the great bakery Meson Keyser a few blocks away. You can bring stuff back to the room since there is a fridge.;5
I booked to this hotel based on the recommendation of my friends. I was a little bit early when we got to the hotel. I was greeted by the Jeffrey and helped us with our luggage. Since we were a little bit early, we asked the the front desk if we can check in early. Duke asked us if this was our first time in the big apple, we told him it was and he was more than welcoming and always with the big smile. Duke was able to not only get us to check in early but he was also able to get us an upgrade for free. Talked about a good start. He explained to us about the breakfast and the bar being open a certain time and that this hotel also has a small gym.   Me and my girlfriend tried the bar that night, and was impressed by the bar tender. I think her name was gina. She told us all the;5
Very comfortable and convenient. 2 blocks from Penn station and the buses out of New York.  Good value for money! Perfect for exploring Manhattan. I would definitely go back. The room was clean and quiet and the morning Espresso was wonderful.;5
We stayed 13 nights, had a 2 King Size bed room including breakfast. The rooms were cleaned every day, we could use a free wifi connection and breakfast was available from 6:30am to 10:30am.  Breakfast included freshly made scrumbled eggs, (Sonia was one of our eggs and pancake makers, she was always very kind and there for a morning small talk), fruits, cereals, jam, bread for toasting, muffins, yoghurts, coffee, tea, juices and cookies/cake.  The rooms with comfortable beds, a bathroom with shower, hair dryer, every day fresh towels, an iron + ironing board, microwave, fridge and television.  If you need, you can wash your clothes, there's a washing machine and a dryer in the hotel. Also a small kiosk, where you can buy things as stamps, postcards, shirts, cigarettes etc.  You;5
Excellent location,great service and food.Would definitely recommend good value for money. The room was very clean good size and very comfortable.The staff were first class and pleasant assisting when required.A great weekend place to stay for theatre and sightseeing.;5
Thanks to Claribel Gutierrez, I have a prime junior suite and it couldnât be more impressive. She was nothing but engaging and extremely helpful in answering all of my questions. I cannot wait to become a âregularâ here. Thank you, Claribel!!!;5
My boyfriend and I were out for the night and stopped into the hotel lobby bar for a drink. We were happily surprised that they had a DJ on a Wednesday. Vanessa our server was very nice and made sure that we were taken care of the whole night, and the manager Michael stopped by and had chatted with us and ern bought us a round of drinks. We will definitely return to the lobby bar!!!;5
Right Next to Universal Studios, Walk in & out of the Park, Don't need a car if All your going to do is Universal Studios, Hotel Price Is Very Much the Same As Everybody else,Food Is Just OK for the Money, Better off at City Walk;5
We came for a three night stay at this hotel and weâre very impressed with the accommodations. The breakfast buffet in the  hotel cafÃ© was excellent. The food selection and quality was wonderful. Our server, Rosendo, was very attentive and provided wonderful service. * photo is from our corner, king room on 23rd floor.;5
The best part of this hotel is the customer service! Pil and Gisel are AMAZING. everything is so clean and beautiful. Its a great location too everything is around 15/20 min away from all the major places to go. I came here for work and the staff has been so accommodating and makes you feel extremely special and cared for.;5
Very nice hotel. Close to MSG. Very helpful staff. Tick Tock Diner on site. Room was very clean. Good view. Easy walk to Empire State Building and Times Square. Valet parking was easy. Wyndham Rewards have a good discount.;5
It's difficult to find this level of service anywhere else. From the start they make your visit feel special. The staff (without exception) is extremely friendly and is willing to go the extra mile for you. The Riad is an oasis of tranquillity. The suites are great, impeccable cleaning (kudos to the nice ladies), the rooftop view is amazing and the breakfast is excellent. And the pickup from the airport is a big plus as well. In short: just book, you won't be disappointed.;5
Thank you to Daniel Medina for being an excellent server to us during our stay. We had a great business dinner with drinks at Five on the Hill and Daniel was excellent to us. He made sure our drinks were accurate, and when we were not 100% happy, he made it right. Thank you!;5
This hotel is a perfect Location for me. I bring the bus in from Pennsylvania and it's only a less than 10 minute walk. The adjoining restaurant called the TickTock has fantastic breakfast. I prefer the eggs Benedict. The staff are extremely friendly and check in is very speedy. My room had two queen beds and two bathrooms which is perfect for a girls weekend;5
We stayed for 5 nights, restaurant was not open, but found plenty of places to eat. With the metro a short walk away,very easy to get to any destination uptown or down once your work how it all works.;5
"I booked this hotel for my parents last year, as part of a much longer cruise trip to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. To keep costs manageable we picked reasonable hotels in New York and Niagara Falls, but this turned out the be their highlight of the whole trip! They were given a great room; clean, bright, quiet and stunning views. Staff treated them like royalty. I can't thank them enough! If I had any negative feedback it would be that the area could be a bit intimidating at night, but security did a great job of making you feel safe.";5
We were in NYC only a few hours when an emergency required us to return home.  The hotel manager was extremely helpful and refunded the balance of our pre-paid stay at The New Yorkers.  She made us customers for life that day!;5
Stopped here for 4 nights and had a great time.  The hotel was clean and tidy and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  David on reception was so helpful when we first arrived as there was a mix up with our booking but he soon sorted it and even gave us an upgrade.  The room was spacious and clean.  Loved the shower, roomy and clean.  Just not enough plug sockets for 2 ladies so a good job I took my 6 gang extension lead lol.  The snacks that are served between 4 and 6 were a great treat, after a hard day walking and seeing the sights we headed back to the hotel to recover ready for the night time touring.  No kettle in the room but asked reception and they sorted one out for me. The concierge are very helpful too and the barman Javier was friendly and a pleasure to have a;5
Absolutely wonderful stay for my company. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The events manager was such a pleasant man and super nice. Hotel food was delicious and plenty of it! Great central location, about a 10 minute walk to Empire State, Times Square and the edge. Stayed in the suite room on the 40th floor and the views of Manhattan were incredible. Felt like I was in a palace! Rooms were very clean and immaculate. Security at the hotel is very good, they make sure you have your room card as soon as you enter the elevators to go up. The only disadvantage I would say is that you have to wait a long time for the elevators as it stops on almost every floor. Thank you very much for the stay and would definitely recommend to anyone whether itâs couples/families/business.;5
We really enjoyed our stay, the room is very spacious and accommodating. Wae at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. She is really great at interesting with guest. Her voice is so sweet. Just one feedback, there was no bell carts displayed at the lobby. I needed to be in the line and asked front desk to be brought out from the bell closet which was not so convenient at all.;5
Love this hotel and staff, and proximity to the Opera. Also across the street from the Smith restaurant & bar which was fab. The rooftop lounge at Empire has a wonderful hot cider and inviting space to enjoy it. Nearby is Le Salle soup dumplings with next door package store to pick up wine. An awesome weekend.;5
This Hyatt location has it right.  Very convenient to LAX and easy access to the roadways.  Renovated with nicely appointed, modern rooms.  Great food choices in the lobby area, really donât even have to leave the property.  Nice club for WOH levels, enough food there for breakfast and dinner.  Self parking garbage with easy access behind the property, half price of valet.  Superb customer service.;5
Great location, super nice and accommodating staff. They were able to get us an early check-in which was wonderful. The lobby was large and clean. We stayed in a double room with another couple and it was spacious enough (especially for an NYC hotel). Complimentary waters and nice bathroom. No fridge, but that is ok. We have had really good experiences with hotels in this area of NYC, but the nice staff really made this one stand out. We would stay here again!;5
If you're keen on luxury don't come to this place. You get a room with a bed and that's it. Bathrooms are shared.  No luxury is no problem? Well then this is the place for you. Ideal location if you want to explore Manhattan and the prices are unbeatable.  The shared bathrooms were always clean and we got two free bottles of water day.  They also have a 24h reception with helpful people.;5
Amazing stay, cannot recommend Riad Kheirredine enough. We were made to feel so welcome, Elena and the ladies at reception organised everything for us, from a city tour and cooking course to a trip to the Atlas mountains, it was perfect. We loved our stay! Thank you to the team for making our time in Marrakesh so memorable, we will definitely be back!;5
I stayed at the quality inn broadway (changed names since to the days inn) for 5 nights in December.  I would rate the hotel 10 out of 10!  The hotel was amazing, the staff where super friendly and helpfull, you would think it was more of a 3* than a 2* to be honest. It had its own little gym and everything, the subway is just around the corner and there is a mcdonalds and dunkin doughnuts just around the corner over the road.  There is also an amazing little jazz bar just a 5 minute walk away.  It was spotlessly clean, we ended up with 2 double beds in the room which was handy we ended up using it for all our souverners!  Id defo recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to new york, its a nice little hotel.  Take care and enjoy!;5
Every time I need a hotel in Midtown Manhattan, I choose the Ameritania. It's proximity to Times Square, Central Park, and Rockefeller Center/5th Ave will ensure an amazing stay with great restaurants and bars close by.   The rooms are cozy and the beds are super comfortable! They even provide earplugs if you're sensitive to the sounds of the city. Every staff member is friendly and super helpful!;5
Great experience, great atmosphere! Staff was all friendly and seemed sincere. Rooms are nice, bed is comfy! I don't think there is a room with a bad view! I will definitely be back.  I highly recommend this Hyatt Regency to everyone.;5
Great stay only 4 blocks from Times Square and 2 blocks from Empire State Building .  Minutes to penn station.;5
We had seen the reviews on TripAdvisor and that's why we chose this Riad among the thousand of other equally beautiful options for a similar price. But even expecting the highest of standards because of the full 5 stars on here (an outstanding achievement!), Riad Kheirredine and its staff exceeded all our expectations in every sense.   The staff here are the kindest, most efficient, cheerful people I have ever met! As a guest, you are treated with the utmost respect and care. They will help you with WHATEVER you need - and I mean that. Ahead of our visit, one of our flights was moved to a time that no longer worked for us, and after unsuccessfully trying to reach the Moroccan airline by phone for days, they volunteered to go to the headquarters in person to deal with the issue.;5
Spacious (for New York) room, great value, good location with easy access to most parts of the city, nice hotel staff...ask for Nick, he has been very helpful and gone the extra mile. All in all - great !;5
"the New Yorker is conveniently located quite near bus and train stations; Macys dept store.   an extremely safe neighborhood to walk.   The New Yorker is a beautiful well maintained older hotel from the 1920-20's.  The staff, building, and location make it an ideal location for a NY stay.";5
This is my fifth time staying at this hotel. I've never had a bad stay and I love the location (you can walk several places and subway stations are convientlty located). The regular rooms are small but if you're not going to be in the room a ton, then they are good.;5
This hotel gave us the benefits of being a Diamond HHonors Members. The view from the 23rd floor was awesome and the room was spacious for 3 people. Wish we had more time to spend at Universal Studios which was conveniently accessed by a shuttle that picks up at the hotel. We will definitely come back here.;5
Wonderful clean hotel, beautiful rooms.  If wanting a day long experience at universal studios don't arrive with luggage before room check in.  Felt extremely silly from attitude from front staff member.;5
It was BIG FUN with our youngest granddaughter Bo in NEW YORK CITY!! It was her turn to join us for a visit to the BIG APPLE where Opa was born and her daddy went to high school! It's a gift we gave to all three grandkids when they finished elementary school. We stayed at Wyndham New Yorker Hotel at 481 Eighth Avenue with friendly personel in a nice area of Manhattan!! I higly recommand it!! We walked miles ans miles everyday and shopped until we dropped. Loved the Broadway mudical Wicked as well as the dinners of chicken fingers, calamari, sushi, Nathan's hot dogs and buffalo wings. Another big hit was Carlo's Bakery on 6th Avenue with great muffins and birthday cakes!!;5
We had a great five nights stay, with an amazing view of the Empire State Building. We were celebrating my partners 30th and we received an upgrade and a bottle of champagne. The lady who checked us in was so friendly and couldnât help us enough. Great location and the most comfy beds! Highly recommend!;5
We really enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker hotel and would most definitely stay here again and also recommend this hotel to others. Itâs ideally situated for Times Square, Empire State Building, Macyâs and lots of other attractions. The staff was always happy to help especially Mohammed on the front desk who checked us in he was so lovely!  Thank you for a lovely stay to all at the New Yorker Hotel!;5
Location was perfect. Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square and 5th avenue. Itâs at the corner on Broadway. The staff was friendly specially the butler who booked us a taxi back to the airport cheaper than Uber. Also the room was comfortable even though it was small.  Although weâre on the third floor the view was nice the shower was great and had a mini fridge, iron and hair dryer. The only downside is that we didnât have a cleaning service due to âcovidâ however masks are optionalð¤·ð»ââï¸ I would stay there again!;5
Great hotel, great location.  Hotel was excellent.  Checkin was smooth.  Staff very friendly.  All cleanliness guidelines in place and followed.  Room well laid out and very comfortable.  Everything was exactly as one could wish for.;5
Good decoration, comfortable bed, enough room space, small but morden bathroom, everything is simple, organized and pleasant. Check in and out wonât take you few minutes, staff are nice and efficient!;5
Our adventure in Marrakech started out with a bang, or to be more accurate, a thunderclap. Just as our driver from the train station pulled up to the Medina walls, the storm clouds that had been darkening the sky finally let loose. We waited out the heaviest of the rain for several minutes in the van before making a mad dash to the Riad, following the two unfortunate employees sent out to fetch us and our luggage. Despite doing our best to stay dry as we dodged traffic and stray cats in the labyrinthine passageways, we arrived at the Riad soaking wet, but were welcomed in by the smiling staff and immediately made to feel at home.   In that first couple minutes, we knew we had chosen the right place to stay. It's a bit cliche, but I felt like I was staying with family. The room;5
From the time we arrived till the time we left we felt like a valued guest. Always happy to help. Shuttle to/from the park was excellent. Room was spacious. Good internet. Free computer and printer usage. Recommend.;5
"I highly recommend this wonderful hotel. The location is perfect - seconds from transportation shopping and dining and entertainment. The hotel is boutique like and charming with a fabulous and warm decor. The rooms are spacious clean and well appointed. It also has a chic rooftop lounge and an array of amenities including an outdoor pool. This hotel offers everything for a pleasurable stay, however  the staff will make all the difference in your expirience- they are exceptionally hospitable.  Especially the front desk staff members: Luis  was incredibly jovial  kind and understanding. Adam was professional , helpful and warm ;as well as Karma who was friendly and welcoming and Pasquale who was compassionate and caring.   Thanks to thier exceptional service we cannot wait to";5
Great services and breakfast, good position near metro red line Hollywood walk of fame and beverly hills. In the hotel there is also a garden with appetizers, free breakfast and beautiful rooms.  There are a lot of shops near the hotel;5
Service Par Excellence is the best way to describe our experience at Riad Kheirredine. From the very beginning Valentina and Yajaira were very professional in all their emails. We were in Marrakesh for a wedding at the Selman Hotel. We booked Riad Kheirredine to be alone for two days to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary after that we stayed at Hotel Delano.  Our stay at Riad Kheirredine cannot compare to anywhere else in Marrakesh. The staff bent backwards to treat us royally. We were met by Ismail where the shuttle dropped us off from the airport. He walked us to the Riad where we met the rest of the staff. The room was so beautiful and well decorated. The meals were delicious Ebrahim served us hand and foot. Freshly squeezed orange juice, home made bread, pastries to;5
We spent six nights here during a summer vacation - what a lucky break, finding this hotel!  We had seen reviews from several sites, and all were positive, so we booked two rooms for two couples (we travel together regularly).  The price was excellent for the area, the room was beautiful, and everyone onsite was incredibly helpful, above and beyond in every way.  Shout out to Jeff the doorman, we were impressed especially with his advice and interest in our specific needs, plus he's a truly nice person.  The hotel even provides ear plugs with the room amenities -- you may never have used them before, but you WILL, here.  Not that the noise is excessive within the room, just that it's a busy area, and you know, New York never sleeps and all that.  Sunday night was pretty quiet,;5
We have stayed at the premier inn county hall many times & always found it to be excellent but this visit Erica was exceptionally lovely & helpful! Thankyou  Erica you are are a credit to the premier inn!;5
I fled here after accidentally booking a dive motel, and it felt like a luxurious rescue. Big, sunny room with trendy decor and good shower! Great mattress and linens! The location worked well as my 'base'. The cost was reasonable, but overnight parking costs $24. For me it was worth it.;5
Our family of four really enjoyed our stay at this Hilton. The staff was very friendly. The front desk service was good. We only ate at this restaurant for breakfast one morning, but it was AWESOME! The proximity to Universal Studios was fantastic. The shuttle that went back and forth to Universal City Walk was great at night. My children went swimming at the pool and they really enjoyed it. The rooms were very clean and were maintained very well. We are not a really picky family, but this place was quite nice. There was a door man, he has family in Toronto, and he was a great guy. We really enjoyed his helpfulness and his company! I wish I could remember his name, because he deserves a raise!;5
This was an excellent hotel for location, service, and style. It has all three! perfectly located right off the parade route. I highly recommend a king room with a view and to try the roof top cantina! Thanks Empire for making my trip!;5
Stayed at the Jane this weekend. Rooms are small but comfortable &cozy. Staff is excellent. Extremely clean bathroom(which is shared).Only negative:slow elevator.Highly recommended!If you ever get the chance,give the Jane a chance!;5
This hotel is amazing! They make sure to make every visitor feel special. My family had so much fun here. Very close to Universal studio. They have very nice seafood buffet too. Pool was very nice. Garden is beautiful;5
Can't beat the location and the rooms were very nice.  The service was good and the lounge was excellent with service through out the day.  the only downside was parking that was higher than expected.  Other wise an excellent hotel for business or leisure, especially if you are coming in and out of Terminal 1/2 at LAX;5
The hotel was nice, but the best part was the bellboy/concierge who helped us. Jeffery went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay, and a safe and manageable price for our taxi service when we left. He was friendly, helpful, even telling us about his favourite restaurant for us to try for dinner. He called, on his day off, to make sure we had everything we needed for our trip. You can't ask for anything better than that!!! Make sure you ask for Jeffery during your stay - you won't be disappointed. 5 Stars!;5
I stayed here for the first time last evening. I brought my 12 yo daughter to see a broadway play. I chose this hotel based on the great price and amazing reviews it received. I was not disappointed! The people working there were the friendliest and most helpful people Iâve experienced in  my travels. The rooms were nice, with bottles of water and a variety of fruit on the desk in our room. My daughter loved the robes and slippers that were left on each of our beds and was excited about the marge shower! It was such a great stay I booked another stay next month for a conference I have to attend! Thank you for making this special mommy daughter overnight so special!;5
The Empire was the hotel they filmed Gossip Girl in at times so never stayed decided to try it for a gift to my family in Puerto Rico and was so pleasantly surprised - from Sophy at Registration who got us a great room to the service in the rooms everything was great - Thanks Sophy for the extra space room and for being so accomodating;5
The hotel is is in a great location within distance to loads of tourist attractions. All the staff are very welcoming & helpful specially Alejandra who made a fuss of our son.  The breakfast was plentiful, lots of choice, we went down for breakfast between 7:30 - 8:30 which was ok but after this time it did get quite busy.  We stayed in room 408 (newly refurbished) spotless, clean & overlooked the front of the building (entrance). There was still work being done but we hardly heard anything & our sleep wasn't interrupted.   We stayed for tea one night which was good bog standard but if you don't want to move very far from base it will fill your belly.  We will stay here again & already planning the next visit, overall great stay.;5
The Empire Hotel was a pleasan hotel very boutique is in style lovely rooms and great service first time at this place pleasantly surprised .Sophy at  reception desk extremely helpful and courteous . Will definitely love to return .  You also cannot beat the great location and the convenience close to Lincoln Center exactly across the street and all the major museums .;5
Location is great if you want to be in the middle of everything. (We were actually able to walk from terminal to hotel-9 minute walk).  Staff was extremely helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. Anything we needed was delivered immediately. Breakfast starts conveniently at 5:00 for you early risers and had something for everyone.;5
The trip included myself and my hubby and it was a trip for our 40th and 50th birthdays as well as our 20th wedding anniversary. When we arrived we were upgraded to the executive room. It was lovely and the shower was fantastic but unfortunately we were looking out at a brick wall. I rang down about it and the receptionist offered to change our room the next day. We ended up declining because we were exhausted and had unpacked and didnt fancy packing and unpacking again. We also were sent up a bottle of champagne the next day after chasing it up. All was fine until St Patricks day when there was an unbelievable amount of noise as if a band was playing on the floor below us. I rang down and asked reception what was going on thinking it was a band for St Patricks day playing in;5
I found this hotel to be great. They are in the process of renovating some areas and their elevators, but they made this clear before I booked the room. They have above and beyond to make sure that no customers on inconvenienced by the elevators by stationing one of their employees right there at the elevators to ensure there are no issues. The room was great and overlooked city walk. The hotel is great and for the price you would be hard to find anything better  in the area.;5
Recently stayed for a short family break. All staff, from the reception to the restaurant, were extremely helpful. Big thank you to Angeli and staff in the restaurant for lovely service. Food was amazing and really good value for money. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Great location aswell! Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anybody looking for a good hotel in London.;5
Our family of 4 stayed here in October 2014. The room was a great size for our 5 night stay. WiFi was available in our room. Room service meals were very good. Starline Tour buses pick you up at the door for city sightseeing. Although within walking distance, there is a free courtesy bus to take you to Universal Studios/ City. Universal City is connected to Universal Studios and has a variety of shops and restaurants. Looks beautiful at night! Only downside is that there is no laundry to do your own washing. Don't miss the Seafood Buffet on the weekend! Absolutely AMAZING!! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and would definately return!;5
we stayed here in January for my husbands birthday we had a lovely room on 28th floor we used the Tick tick diner within the hotel which is open 24 hours lovely food brilliant friendly service Joseph who served us daily was lovely so friendly explained menu and had a smile for everyone . Most of the staff friendly and helpful Italian restaurant service not as good they could learn from Tick Tock staff;5
Stay here every time at Universal, perfect. The rooms are always clean and have great views and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Only thing is I'd like the shuttle to run later between the hotel and Universal Studios/Citywalk.;5
Excellent location when visiting Universal Studios, the free shuttle is a great bonus.  Being close to the freeway made it easy to get around LA. Our room was clean and spacious, a bit more care in vacuuming could be taken. The furnishing are getting a bit worn & dated.  The beds were very comfortable. Room prices are at the high range and there are extra charges for everything.  Parking is extra and bottled water in the room. Overall the hotel is very good & we would stay here again when in the area.;5
"I recently stayed here for 2 nights while I was in NYC. I loved the location and the close proximity to many ""must see"" sights in the city. It is within walking distance to the Empire State building, Times Square, Broadway, 42nd street and Penn Station. The hotel is pretty much busy at all times, but they do check to make sure you have a room key before letting you get on the elevators. My room was very small but I was expecting that. I really have no complaints and would definitely stay here again when I return to the city.";5
"It would be too easy to warmly advise this piece of paradise in the heart of the old medina to couples of all ages traveling to marrakech or to a small group of friends. What makes the difference between a quality boutique hotels and a unique place is the treatment for a woman traveling on her own in a country. Every detail counts in the rooms, common spaces and above all in the service. Your beauty case can be reduced to your day & night cream, toothpaste, toothbrush and hairbrush. Nothing else as you will get addicted to the fabulous organic beauty products that you will find in the bathroom; to the point that you will ask where to buy the same products in Marrakech to bring them back home. The rooms are precious and you will feel as a princess. Especially if you indulge on";5
Ideal location for touring the city. It's close to so many of the sites that you don't need a cab. Good room size with very comfortable beds. The bar is good for an evening night cap. Excellent staff.;5
My family and I quite enjoyed our stay at the Hilton in Universal City. It is central to just about anywhere around LA. The hotel itself was clean. The room was large, clean, comfortable and the view was astounding. I urge you to splurge for the tower rooms. The staff were excellent and all our needs were addressed. My Ten year old daughter loves staying in hotels and I believe this has been her favorite to date. The continental breakfast was soooooo good and so filling that in four days we never once considered upgrading to the equally fantastic buffet breakfast, even though at only a $9.00 upgrade fee.....it was a steal.  I could go on and on about this hotel. I would not even consider staying anywhere else....we enjoyed it that much. As a family we look forward to our next;5
This hotel was great!  The beds are very comfortable and the location is perfect.  The rooftop bar is extremely awesome!;5
The service was amazing and the team is incredible and very welcoming!! Everyone was always looking after the guests. I had very nice days with my family. The location is central and easy to reach once you understand where to go - if not, the hotel will always dispose someone to walk you through the main street. We ate in the terrace of the hotel and the restaurant had the best Tajine! A big thank you to everyone, I will definitely recommend to my surroundings!;5
The Empire is  a great location if you are planning a stay in NYC. East access to Lincoln Center, Time Warner and public transportation. Prices are reasonable and the staff was fantastic from check-in through checkout. A great alternative to big hotel chains.;5
The Riad offers tranquility in the middle of a chaotic city and the service from Valentina and the team was excellent. Make sure that you book the taxi offered by the Riad from the airport as when you first arrive in the city the myriad of narrow alleyways mean it could be ages before you find the Riad otherwise !  As you wonder down the backstreets it is easy to be concerned what the Riad will be like but do not fear as the accommodation is excellent. Do make sure you explain to the staff at the start what you had planned to do - we had booked the Heritage Spa (excellent) and a couple of restaurants and Valentina suggested a change of time for one of our bookings and a change of restaurant for the other ! - both worthwhile.  Best of all was the fact the staff were always asking;5
Fab hotel in Midtown Manhatten. Close to Central Park and Times Square. Very clean, comfy rooms and staff mega helpful, particularly Jeff the doorman. He really helped us plan our activities and how to negotiate the subway. Would definitely stay here again.;5
This is a great location and a great hotel... I will definitely be coming back again... This was not my first time staying at this exact hotel and it will not be my last time... I had a great experience this last time...;5
Great hotel, clean and perfect location. Staff was great.  The front door man Tom was insightful about places to visit, restaurants to eat and things to do in NYC. Very accommodating and hospitable. Bryant park was perfect recommendation for the kiddies and the shops were beyond cute.;5
Fantastic hotel in a great, central location. As soon as we arrived staff were excellent, especially Mohammed who checked us in. Weâd booked a view suite double (4 adults) and I e/mailed before arrival requesting landmark view. We got top floor with Empire State building view. Added to our great experience. Tick Tock diner is good and coffee / pastries every morning in reception are reasonably priced. Subway station right under hotel is convenient. Would definitely recommend New Yorker.;5
Hotel was quick to get to from Newark Airport. We upgraded to a suite which was no trouble for the staff. All staff were friendly and went out their way to help.  Great location opposite Madison Square Garden and close to Penn Station. Our suite was on level 30 and from the lounge we could see the  Empire State Building. Room was clean and lounge and bedroom had individual temperature controls. Only gripe was that we booked bed and breakfast and breakfast was only a juice, coffee and a croissant or similar pastry.  If weâd been told this by our travel agent weâd have gone room only. However the tick tick diner did take a reduction for our more substantial breakfast using the breakfast coupons. That was the only gripe about the hotel. Very busy city and we fitted lots in. Next;5
Wonder stay with the most amazing staff. The hotel is the complete deal. From the check in with Pil and his smile that can make your day better. The breakfast that gives you fuel for the day. The pool is sparkling clean and the best part of the long summer days. At night you can enjoy a comedy show in the Route 66 bar and a few drinks. I have to say this hotel met and beat my expectations. Truly happy overall.;5
My family have just returned from a 6 day trip to New York. The rooms were nice and clean and staff were extremely friendly. Highly recommend this hotel as its location was brilliant especially for MSG.;5
We visited the Empire celebrating my friends 60th birthday this month.  The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and professional.  Once they learned it was Ann's birthday they upgraded us and left wine in her room.  Bar and lobby atmosphere excellent, great location, good value for money.;5
i went this past week with my husband and had an amazing experience at the Astor. Glenny from the front desk was very sweet and helpful. she made my day!  going back for sure!!i recommend eating at the malecon restaurant  amazing food!;5
Our stay in Riad Kheirrdeine was the best hotel stay we have ever experienced.   The riad is beautifully designed, with little alcoves all over the place, fountains, pools, terraces, and little winding staircases.  It manages to have a very peaceful air about it, while being smack in the middle of the bustling Marrakech medina.  The decor is grandiose and authentically Moroccan, while still maintaining a homey feel.   The service was outstanding! Every single staff member, from reception, to the waiters, to the cleaning staff were all gracious, helpful, and genuinely kind.  Special shout-out to Sara, Elena and Achmed for all their help.   We truly felt like we were the only guests there, with every single one of our needs taken care of instantly.   They were so generous,;5
Booked a hotel room since we were visiting Broadway. When we arrived we were greeted by Matt and Mejid, who were very friendly and extremely helpful. They provided us with all the information we needed and gave us some advice to make our trip easier. They were totally amazing.  The room was clean and extremely comfortable. It was well furnished and had all the amenities. I loved the crazy huge mirror and the neat light fixtures.  I'd totally recommend. Great staff and great room.;5
Stayed here March 2019. Hotel right across from Madison Square Garden. Diner attached to hotel a wonderful place to eat breakfast.  Diner open 24/7. Hotel is half block from Penn Station so if arriving by train you only have to drag your suitcases half block to hotel. Art Deco style of hotel;5
Fantastic location in NY for everything my fiance and I wanted to do. Almost everything was walking distance and there is a subway station a block away for everything that was a bit further. The staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful upon check-in and check-out. The room was small but very much expected for NY and we didn't need more than that as we were out all day. Noise wasn't a huge issue as we were far enough from Times Square to not hear the crowds late at night - only noise was a normal big city during rush hour in the morning (lots of honking). Overall, incredibly happy and would absolutely stay there again.;5
The price of our stay was double what is was in the past. We stay at the Hyatt Regency for transportation to the airport for early morning flights. I recommend checking the Hilton and Marriott hotels next door for better value.;5
"Note: if walking from LAX to this hotel, Google Maps wants to route you on an unnecessary 15 minute loop. Just walk from the LA*Xit taxi & rideshare are directly towards the hotel and it's only a block or two away.  Hotel was very quiet; I couldn't hear any plane traffic.";5
Stayed here for 6 nights. Great location in LA as it is close to the highway and can get anywhere. Also, as the name suggests, it is across from Universal Studios and CityWalk which are great attractions. For me, Universal Studios is a one day affair and the rest of the time should be spent seeing everything Los Angeles has to offer. A recommendation is going to Malibu because it is absolutely beautiful. Driving through the canyon to Malibu is also a great experience. The concierge is beyond great as they are so helpful to get anywhere you need to go. The staff were all friendly and attended to all concerns although one person at the front desk was not so pleasant. The restaurant was good. The pool was also nice. Had an executive room on the 19th floor facing the studios as well;5
The Empire Hotel in NYC was amazing! I had a short visit to NYC and the comforts of this hotel were perfect. Romeo was especially helpful (front desk) and very friendly! I will be back again in the near future and this hotel will definitely be my first choice!;5
Our first time to New York and this hotel and we would definitely go back and recommend this hotel everything and everyone was amazing especially Jeffery the man who stands outside got us taxi and told us where everything was answered all our question he really made the stay that much better;5
Stayed at the Hollywood Hotel over the thanksgiving period. Arrived on the first night and was given a room which had one or two problems. Contacted the staff on the front desk who immediately arranged for me to change rooms. The new room was very clean and was superb. Put the original problem down to one room maybe awaiting renovation. The new room had superb beds, very good tea and coffee facilities and a large bathroom with a very powerful shower. I was aware of the charge for parking in advance and was quite happy to pay for a central location and had already received a very good rate for the room. When you add the two prices together itâs actually a very good price. The neighbourhood seemed very well policed and is conveniently positioned between two Metro Stations.;5
I frequently stay in Premier Inns but this was my first time at County Hall and I was really impressed. Customer service was exceptional. Every single member of staff was super-friendly, efficient and professional.  Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Soundproofing was excellent - we literally didn't hear a sound all night, despite being right on the South Bank and the hotel being quite busy.   On top of all that, location is excellent. Walking distance to many sights, right on the bus routes and close to Waterloo, Charing Cross and Westminster stations. Lovely Italian restaurant 'Locale' just a few doors down. Will definitely be booking there again.;5
Even if my stay schedule changed and check-out was early, I was kind enough to help me me Pil was very helpful. the room was the best and the pool was very nice. i will stay again for sure next time im back from japan.;5
I spent 6 days in this Riad together with my girlfriend and we were more than overwhelmed!   We were greeted politely in the Riad Kheirredine which is located in the Medina, so the old town in Marrakech, with Moroccan tea and fruit and have immediately felt at home! â¤ï¸  The room service was 2x per day in the room and has even ironed our laundry that was crumpled by the flight, while we either made it comfortable at one of the 2 pools or walked through the old town and visited the beautiful places of Marrakech.  Also on the roof of the riad, where about 30 different seats and loungers are, you can have breakfast and meanwhile enjoy the view over the entire old town! It is so relaxing to just listen to the birds while enjoying the sunshines and look over the oldtown! ð   If you;5
Before arriving at the hotel / hostel I was very optimistic about the place after looking at the bad pictures and reading a lot of the horrible reviews. I had booked the place because it had seemed much better than other hotels and hostels and also the price was brilliant for Manhattan. When I arrived to the hotel, it seemed very clean, although the hall carpets were dirty but this doesn't affect us so it doesn't matter. When we got into the room, we were very pleased. It had a soft double bed, an HD Lcd TV on the wall, a fridge really cold aircon and a cosy private bathroom. The room was small however just the size for us both. Room was cleaned every day and on th last day they let us keep our baggage there and have showers before our flight home. I would say if you book a;5
Hands down, this hotel has the best customer service from any other hotel I've evey stayed. Oralia went out of her way to make sure my husband and I were pleased and enjoy our breakfast. She cooked a fantastic breakfast which included the perfect tasting and sized omelettes. Oralia was very friendly and kept a pleasant smile on her face at all times. She was very neat and clean. We enjoyed every bit of our breakfast and stay. Thank you Oralia for helping make our stay so perfect at Hollywood Hotel. Will definitely visit again.;5
This hotel is great if you want to go to Universal Studios but the nearby metro makes the hotel convenient for visiting sights like Chinese theatre etc. There are lots of good restaurants, shops and bars within walking distance and the hotel staff were really helpful with directions etc. All in all we had a great stay!;5
We arrived from Australia after a 15 hour flight.  Our room was not ready as we had arrived 5 hours too early for check in. Stewart at front reception made sure we didn't have to wait too long and about 2 hours later we were pleased that not only was our room ready but he had also upgraded us and our 2 friends who were arriving from Ireland later in the afternoon.  The staff was friendly and always willing to help us out.  The location is fantastic - with a short 10 minute walk to Universal Studios/City, loads of restaurants for everyone - Howling at the Moon on a Saturday night is a must!!!  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting LA!!;5
After much research we decided on the Hilton at Universal City for our accommodation close to Universal Studios, great location and excellent service, fantastic views. We nearly booked the Sheraton but so glad we didn't when we got there and saw it. Don't waste time looking at to many places this will meet all expectations also handy to Hollywood and getting to Six Flags Magic Mountain;5
We stayed for 4 nights in late January and I'm not ashamed to say that I was teary as we said our goodbyes to staff who felt more like old friends and family. We were given a free upgrade in room which was a wonderful surprise. As others have mentioned, you are provided with a mobile phone, a map and are guided through the medina on your first foray from the Riad to make sure that you can find your way back again. But what really floored me was the warmth and genuine committment to making our stay as memorable as possible. Every morning Hakim greeted us at breakfast and asked us what our thoughts were on how we were going to spend the day. I came to Marrakech with ideas of what I wanted to see and what I wanted to do - Hakim went out of his way to turn those ideas into;5
I took my wife to Lincoln Center for her birthday and even though we live nearby in the suburbs we decided to stay for the night at the Empire. The hotel is PERFECT for this purpose. I was very thankful that Jeffrey made check-in a breeze and accommodated a very special request for ust. We had dinner at Rosa Mexicano around the corner, then a great time at La Traviata and finally spent a couple of hours in the beautiful and chic  rooftop lounge.HIGHLY recommended for comfort, convenience and fun! We will be back!;5
My husband and i stayed at Riad Kheirredine in January 2017. The Riad was wonderful. They organized all transfers from the bus station,the airport, and to restaurant reservations, had staff go out with us to the main souk until we felt comfortable to go on our own, gave us a cell phone that we could use during our stay, and were friendly and attentive the whole time. The room was beautiful, very clean and nothing was too much for the staff. While we were there, the owner, who is Italian was at the Riad and cooked a lovely meal in the kitchen for the guests. all in all, the level of service that we received was on par with hotels at a much higher price point.  Would love to return!;5
The things that keep me coming back to this hotel is the great location to the airport. The upgrades they did on the hotel and the excellent service from Cairo and Derek in the Regency Club. Those two are the best!!!;5
After reading a number of negative reviews, we were apprehensive about staying here, booked as a result of our Priceline bid. Much to our delight, this is a wonderful hotel. The staff is helpful and friendly. The room  had great beds and was as big as we needed. The only negative was the shower, which is an open design and somewhat unusual. It took a while to figure out how to get hot water, but their engineer staff explained it and it works fine. Other than that we would definitely recommend the Empire. The food at Ed's Chowder House was excellent, and the location across from Lincoln Center can't be beat. Don'[t believe everything you read in these reviews. People love to complain, but we had nothing but a wonderful stay here.;5
Excellent location.  Great views form the rooms.  Rooms spacious and very clean.  Staff were professional and courteous.  Linda at the front desk was amazing and very flexible.  Her customer service was a 10/10.;5
Our family was on it's last stop of a two week vacation. We got to the hotel and greated by very friendly bell-hops and a valet to park our car. They gave us directions on where to go and they would take care of our bags and car. I proceeded to the check-in desk around 1:00 p.m. There was one person in front of me. There must of been a problem with her reservation because the gentlman was on a phone trying to straighten out something.  There were two others working at the desk and several other people were in line to check in.  It seemed like there should have been more there to help out because two of the three people  there had issues.  I was not in a hurry, but others could have been impatient with how long it took.  After, the person in front of me got taken care of, the;5
Fantastic boutique hotel very central to Maceyâs Times Square and penn station.  We where there just prior to Thanksgiving leaving the morning of thanksgiving.  Hotel is fantastic and NYC as always a pleasure to visit;5
At the Hollywood hotel we were greeted professionally by Elias and cinthya, they were very helpful and kind to us.  We were able to get in our hotel room earlier so we could start our day.  Overall we are extremely happy with the service they provided;5

Stayed one night in a small suite over looking Lincoln center. Spacious room, nice bed, and a very powerful shower. Doorman very friendly and prompt, and breakfast on the mezzanine level terrific. Bartender on Tuesday late night really fit the vibe of the place, and quickly served me a great negroni while mixing other drinks. Highly recommend the hotel;5
Needed a place to stay on short notice. This hotel exceeded expectations. Right next to airport (about 5 min walk) but rooms were remarkably soundproof. The hotel breakfast bar was very convenient and had a great tea and coffee selection. The fitness center was very impressive and on the top floor with amazing views of LA.;5
Everything and everyone at Riad Kheirredine is 5 star quality. We visited with another couple and we were treated like family and were taken care of . We loved our time lounging in our comfortable rooms and on the outstanding roof top terraces. Thank you to the owner, Madame Marina for such a wonderfully appointed riad.  We wanted to personally thanks the staff Sarah , Asma, Imane Marta, and especially Elena and Walid..  You made our stay so enjoyable. We will be back!;5
I have stayed at several Hyatt Regency hotels and this is definitely one of the best. The staff was very nice and accommodating to a room change request. The best part is the ease and convenience to the LAX!;5
I spoke with Pil who was very accommodating to my last minute request for a room. Pil was very friendly and wanted to make sure I received everything I needed to have a comfortable stay with my friends. He gave me many suggestions about clubs around the Hollywood area and offered great food spots. Thank you to him for going above and beyond my expectations! Definitely will be visiting the Hollywood Hotel again.;5
I visited here two years ago and I loved my stay. I needed a last minute room and when I called thankfully they had a room available. The room was spacious and cozy. The club on the rooftop was also great. Being that it was a Friday night the line was pretty long to get in but because I was a guest I did not have to wait on it. The staff was courteous and polite. Xnachy from the front desk took wonderful care of us just like the last time I visited. I cannot wait to return.;5
I just read the previous reviews and I have to say I was shocked!! Patrick the manager is such a gentleman, he assisted me with places to go what to see, what is good to eat. the rest of his staff was sweet but not full of information. the room I had was 102 on the first floors, BEAUTIFUL!!! very clean, towels 32 inch flat screen need more channels only complaint. my experience was so good I am coming back in the fall. come to Morningside you will be pleasantly surprise!;5
Originally the reservation was only able to accommodate me with 2 double beds. We got to hotel early and not only were they able to accommodate us with a king bed but also allowed us to check in early and waived the early check in fee. This allowed us to drop off our luggage in room and see the city. Front desk was very accommodating. Highly recommend this hotel!;5
Great hotel very clean stayed 8 nights used it as our base in LA, as the other reviews state great for Universal, we arrived early about 11.00am and although our room was not ready the very helpful front desk staff moved us to one that was 19th floor great views, did not use the pool area but it looked pristine, Only downside cost of $18 dollars per night for the car but then again thats LA it cost more to park the car for 8 days around LA than it did to feed myself! LOL. Also hotel has a limit on changing travellers cheques of $100 a day can be a bit of pain if like myself you forget to do it when you are out (but that is my fault and not the hotels). Great stay, Great staff very friendly and helpfull, I would definately stay here again.;5
Highly recommend this Riad. Staff couldn't do more for their guests, happy to organise taxis, help with directions and serve food and drink - even made me a birthday cake !  You could find more central Riad's/hotels but this place ticks all the boxes.;5
Stayed two nights in late September 2014.  Used valet parking to check our luggage before room was ready.   No problem as staff was very accomodating.  Requested a room with a view at high floor. Spent the day at Universal Studios and checked back about 5:30PM.  Got a great room on the 15th floor.  Nice size corner room.  Only minor complaint was the lack of sink area to store components but otherwise nice size bathroom.  No problems with the elevators as they have an attendant operating the elevators to ensure they are running smoothly.  Had happy hour cocktails in the bar area.  Very nice overall experience.  While not on the cheap side, the hotel is very nice and worth the money.  Can walk to Universal / Citywalk area and or take a shuttle that comes by every 15 minutes.;5
Our receptionist Drisser went above and beyond to see that my son and I were completely satisfied with the room we eventually moved into.  He stood by his word to make our stay what we were expecting from the advertised choices, and went out of his way to see that the room details were conveyed to the staff there.;5
The staff was really friendly and available. The room was clean and the localization is great : three blocks from the subway station, 2min walk from Central Park. The neighborhood is lovely with many markets and restaurants near it.;5
I stayed at Morningside Inn for 6 days and it was fantastic value for the money.  The room was small but very clean and had everything I needed.  The wifi was pretty good except at high volume times of day ( on the sixth floor).  The location is great and the amenities directly around it make it easy to eat cheap while in the city, especially Absolute bagels.  The staff were friendly and helped out when my flight was cancelled.  I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews but I would definitely stay there again  and recommend it to those who are traveling on a budget.;5
We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed it very much, had to ask for Pil he is so funny. Bit on the tired side in the night time but always has a nice smile. He and the rest of the staff make you feel at home.  Highly recommended to all traveling for short stays.;5
Staff friendly and attentive to guests needs. I arrived 3 hours earlier than expected but they found a room for me right away. Like the next door access to the subway and walking distance many other sights. Lots of international travelers stay here.;5
Our stay was great.  The rooms are clean, the toiletries are high quality.  The hotel was clean and quiet, even though there were lots of events in the ballrooms including a ballroom dance competition and large Hallowe'en party.  The concierge was very helpful as well.;5
We just happen to pick this hotel due to the location near Central Park.  It ended up as a perfect choice near great restaurants & shopping and away for the craziness of the Time Square & Rockefeller Center during the Holiday Season,  It was an easy walk to any of these venues.;5
What a pleasant surprise this hotel turned out to be! While the neighborhood and exterior of the hotel isn't the greatest the interior was like a resort!  Angelica checked me in fast and professionally. I got a 2nd floor queen room with a shared balcony. The room was small but lush and very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice and clean.   WiFi was fast and reliable. The best part maybe was the free breakfast downstairs. Omlette and waffle station was amazing! I got up at 630 every morning to have the hearty breakfast. Best of any hotel I've stayed at.   Do yourself a favor and book a room and this resort like hotel in the middle of Hollywood near the Red Line metro station!;5
Ameritania was great, excellent location close to Times Square, theatres, Central Park, restaurants. Staff were very helpful and room was very clean and modern. Beds were small and uncomfortable however. But overall we were very happy with our stay!;5
We had a wonderful time in NYC. The staff here were always smiling & willing to help. The bartender remembered our drinks from 2 days before. The rooms were very clean. You could not ask for a better stay. I love how they have ice cold water in the lobby.;5
I couldn't ask for a better hotel.The hotel was in pristine condition. They offered real apples at check in. The man was super helpful with food delivery to the hotel. The bar, restaurant, and cafe options were awesome. Randy's donuts at the cafe are to die for.;5
We booked the hotel through Expedia for an awesome price and we weren't disappointed!  We chose to do public transportation while we stayed here in LA and having the metro right by the hotel was a plus!  We were able to take the metro to Hollywood walk of fame, Santa Monica, Universal Studios, Koreatown and Union station!  We also booked tickets online for universal studios and needed to print them.  Unfortunately the printer station downstairs was out of order but Nancy Ramierez at the front desk came to our rescue!  She immediately had me forward my email to her and she printed them straight out for me.    Second bonus was the fact that breakfast was included and it was amazing!!  Made to order any kind of eggs you wanted and waffles too!  Saved us money and we always left the;5
After searching for weeks for a hotel I could afford for my first trip to the city, I had all but given up when I came across the Astor for only $55 dollars a night! I was weary of the quality or location of the hotel because it was so cheap, but it was perfect. The room was small, but perfect for me and my boyfriend. We even had a veiw of the park (which was directly across the street) and of the city, though it was far away. It was a nice quit snowy couple of nights. There are some good places to eat right arounfd the corner too. Im going back this december and we've booked this hotel again!;5
"From the moment we arrived, the staff at the Riad Kheirredine, treated us like family.  We were Aunt & niece traveling together.  They  gave us a phone so we could always reach them.  They made sure we were safe by having taxis ready for us, as well as ""walkers.""  I cannot say enough about Sarah and her staff.  I have traveled 99 countries, always stayed in luxury 5 star hotels, and never have I had such a phenomenal experience.  The breakfast, which was included, was ""fit for a queen.""  Drinks on the rooftop overlooking the city was breathtaking, and the lamb tangine was extraordinary!  I, also, cannot say enough about Morocco and the people.  So kind and so at peace.  All the cities from Casablanca, Rabat, Fes, The Atlas Mountains, Erfoud, The Sahara, were amazing, but there";5
Had a great week staying at this hotel. Check in was quick & efficient & got a complimentary breakfast for our party as it was my birthday & I declined a bottle of champagne as I don't really drink. Had a fantastic view of Empire State Building from our room! The room was spacious with 2 double beds & plenty of space to put our clothes. Staff were friendly & room was cleaned daily.  Great location with major attractions within walking distance of about 10-15 minutes. For security you had to show staff your key card to enter lift area. Would definitely return to this hotel in the future.;5
Wonderful place to stay! Nadie and staff were very accommodating with my medical situation and ensured I had all my needs met! Nadie even went over and beyond to make sure I knew of all the food spots that offered discounts as this chick never likes to pay full price if I donât have too!;5
Everyone comments on how small the rooms are ... but the rooms are so beautifully decorated and fitted out to seem like an exotic steamship cabin.  Even though I was there during the weekend ... I rarely even saw anyone in the shared bathroom.  I wished I had brought a mesh bag for my shower gear though as it would be easier to manage in the stall showers.  When I am in NYC, I don't spend much time in my room anyway and here the price is right.  Plus a diverse and interesting clientele.;5
Excellent experience! Stayed for over a month due to relocation and the service was exceptional. Decided to extend with family as the service and location are great!   Kevin Finister office manager was excellent!!! Ask for him if you need help.;5
"I loved my stay here. it was pleasant, clean, and extremely friendly. I loved hearing good morning from the staff. The free breakfast buffet was awesome Thanks to Hugo the cook for knowing what we wanted before we ordered. The location of this hotel was amazing as well. Below Griffiths Park; about 3 train stops to the Walk of Fame (hollywood), a view of the Hollywood Sign, easy access to the freeways and necessary stores as well. I would suggest anyone to stay here when they visit Hollywood/Los Angeles";5
Check in staff were just great ! We loved are stay - had a nice room on 34 th floor and the view of the Chrysler  building!  It is so central and that worked out great for us - if we ever go back to NYC.- we know where to go !!;5
wife and I did a 1 night layover and needed a late checkout, most hotels will give you the boot at 11 or 12am, Yuditsela, the front clerk, asked what time would be best for us....... 4pm no problem! resturant staff was great. rooms are super nice, free airport shuttle..... I have been a Marriot customer for some years, time to switch to Hyatt.;5
I've just returned from a short break away with my husband to celebrate my 30th birthday and had the most amazing time.  The Riad was definately the highlight of the trip, it was beautiful inside with service that would put most 5star properties to shame.  The staff were friendly and no request was too big for them, in fact they actively offered to help you or provide refreshments, dinner reservations etc.  My birthday was made extra special by the staff and owner, i recieved roses at breakfast, an amazingly laid out dinner table (the food here is great) and then the most delicious Chocolate birthday cake which had been personalised for me.  Really cant describe how great this place is.  I would highly recommend taking the hotel transfer, its easy and the service is great.  the;5
I had an amazing experience at this hotel. We mistakingly booked our hotel for the wrong dates with a third party and the staff went above and beyond to fix out issues. They allowed us to check in early, and gave us a high profile room. AJ, Mackenzie, and Pasqua were amazing. Definately will stay again!;5
The staff was very friendly and they really show interest in making you feel welcome and appreciated as a customer. As soon as we got there, the doorman was helping us to get settled, Sufia, at the front desk was amazing as well.  We were able to check in earlier (11 am) and they even upgraded our room. We requested a high floor and it was provided to us without hesitation.  The room was really comfortable and the bathroom and shower were awesome. The location is great.  I will definitely stay here again!;5
I stayed here for  3 nights with my 2 12 year olds.  The place is very clean, the staff is very courteous, friendly and helpful.  We got a free upgrade upon arrival and had 2 double beds on the 17th floor with a view of Universal. The beds were very comfortable and I loved that we could walk to Universal.  There is a bridge that goes from the hotel to Universal but you need to ask the staff how to get there, it's kind of confusing if you've never been there before.  The walk is 7 minutes from hotel to Universal.  We did take the shuttle a few times, but it would have been faster to walk!    We ate at the hotel for breakfast at the coffee corner, where they have starbucks coffee and muffins, danishes and donuts.  We did eat one meal at the buffet they have at the other;5
Prior to leaving the U.S. for vacation we arranged an airport pickup through the Riad and just as promised, our driver was there waiting for us with a sign for the Riad Kheirredine.  Our driver, Mohammed was friendly and told us about the significance of many important sites as we passed them on our drive.  I would highly recommend asking the Riad to arrange for the airport pickup as haggling for a cab at the airport might be a bit overwhelming upon arrival.    Mohammed dropped us off at the taxi stand in Sidi Ben Slimane where Ismail was already there waiting for us (cars cannot fit into alley ways of the medina so you must go by foot from that point).  We were greeted by Ismail, one of the Riad's staff, to cart our bags and walk us through the winding medina alleys to the;5
Arrived on 13/02/22 for 6 nights and was a fantastic hotel and overall experience in NYC.  Was treated to an upgrade to a suite on 23rd floor which was perfect and gave us plenty of room and extra sofa bed in living area.   Staff were all really friendly and courteous.   Great stay and hope to be back;5
The location is close to LAX, with close access to a lot of other areas by car. I was visiting Family in Marina del Rey and found that this was close enough by car, and I didn't need to get on the interstate(s).   Hotel was clean, staff was friendly and helpful.;5
My husband and I recently visited NYC for our honeymoon and booked Ameritania via the Secret Hotels option on Lastminute.com.   Upon arrival, we were asked about the reason for our visit and when we told them it was our honeymoon, we were informed that our room had been upgraded and by the time we got to our room, we had a bottle of champagne on our bedside table. Great service.   When we first entered the room we were slightly disappointed to find that our windows looked out on to an inward facing courtyard, so there was no natural light and we couldn't have our lights on at night etc without people being able to see directly in. The airconditioning was also on and it was incredibly noisy. We asked the porter if the air con sounded like this in every room and he told us it did.;5
I stayed in this hotel with three other friends.  My friend and I had an outside room which was a little larger than the inside rooms. Each had two queen beds. We had a very nice experience. I was pleasantly surprised that whenever we needed something we always received it. Yassin on the front desk was especially helpful.  Boutique hotels that I have stayed at in NYC have smaller rooms but Iâm only there to sleep anyway! This was a very nice, clean and responsive hotel.;5
Attended a catered event here for Christmas.  I had never been to this location, and was surprised at the number of event in progress.  However, I noticed as I walked through that every one of them seemed to be organized and under control.  The wait staff was professional and efficient.  When I reached my event, I was pleased by the decor and the appetizers served.  Dinner was excellent!  I am usually skeptical of hotel food, but this was as good as I had had at a restaurant.  It was perfectly prepared, seasoned and displayed well on the plate.;5
We stayed here at the beginning  of June for 7 nights,the room was clean and kept tidy, beds changed every day and the room was spacious.  Could do with a dressing table to get ready at, however, wheeled a chair through to the bathroom and sat at the mirror in there. The hotel offers breakfast every morning but there is no variety, same things day in, day out...you can have eggs cooked to however you would like and the staff are friendly, could do with mixing up with some different sausage, meats or some bacon on certain days, we got bored after day 3 and ate out from then on. The hotel pool area is ideal, kept very clean and tidy. The only complaint I would have is the price of the parking, $24 dollars per night racks up if you are there for more than a couple of days, could do;5
My husband and I and our 3 children just recently stayed at the Hilton in Universal City whilst we were visiting the US. The hotel was fantastic!!! Best location for visiting Universal studios and for seeing the sights of LA (we did have a car though). Universal studios was across the road so we had no worries about trying to get through the LA traffic to get there on time. Universal City was next door and that was fantastic for dinners, lots of child friendly restaurants and shops and we felt very safe strolling through the area at night. There was a free shuttle back to the hotel if we wanted to use it rather than walking, we did take advantage of that on a few nights after we had been walking all day!!   The room itself was great - large, clean and great views! We were;5
I'm quite delayed in leaving this review, but we stayed in May 2016 for 4 nights and it was absolutely fabulous. We had originally planned to stay much earlier in the season but a family emergency prompted us to change our trip. Marco looked after us and was an absolute pleasure to work with. Our room was the Rose room and we enjoyed every minute. The facilities, location, food, and service are all 5 star and each contributed to our comfort and amazement of Marrakesh. Thank you to the entire Riad Kheirredine team! We will be back, this time from the USA!!!;5
Stayed in this hotel in a trip with my parents. Just on 8th Avenue this amazing sky scraper hotel makes you soak up the NYC atmosphere. Great location near Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State visible from my bedroom window and a five minute walk. Lots of great things close by and in this great city all you want to do is walk around and Times Square / Broadway is less than 15 minutes walking away. Great little pancake store adjacent to the hotel .;5
Upon arrival I was greeted with a  friendly smile from Chaunea and co workers as she assisted me with check in. She informed me of all details I would need to know while staying there and answered all my questions. I came to look forward to seeing her daily until I departed on my 4th in NYC. Two different gentlemen helped us with our bags one at arrival and another at departure. The decor of the hotel is beautifully eye catching.  The room we chose was beautiful it was standard hence a tight fit, next time I will go with a king room and YES I will 100% be back. The gym had great equipment though a very tight space.;5
Brilliant.  Yes room is tiny but v sexy and who cares?  IN NYC a hotel room is for sleeping in.  Bathroom is share but a gorgeous room, spotless, warm, has shampoo conditioner and cleanser, all works v beautifully.  Lots of space to tuck suitcase and bags, and to hang things (bring own hangers).  Love the slippers and robe provided.  Staff v helpful.  Could not have asked for better value.  Just near end of High Line, and 8 or so blocks from several different subway stations.  So glad this place was recommended to me.  Price is budget but it doesn't feel rough like budget usually does.  Fantastic character.;5
Stayed at this location for a January event and was pleasantly surprised when we received an upgrade through Wyndham Rewards.  In addition the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.  The room we were put in had the extra room which made the stay even better, as rooms in NYC typically aren't the most spacious!  We go to the same event in January every year, and you can be sure that when we go again next year we'll be staying at the New Yorker again!;5
Would highly recommend Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport to anybody wanting an A Class experience, service was impeccable throughout stay, rooms perfect,clean.Stay was 100%.Highly recommend.5 Star Experience.;5
Not only is the New Yorker a classic New York hotel, but it lives up to the billing. The staff are friendly and helpful, and one feels almost as though Frank Sinatra will step around the corner any minute. Itâs a classic feel with all the modern conveniences.;5
OK, hands up, we found one fault,  there was a slightly spikey plant near the entrance to our room which we had to do a little wiggle around.  Thats it, thats the only thing I can think of and thats me pushing it!  So positives (there are many!)  Taxi organised for us. I recommend this option as piece of mind and hassle free.  Met at the taxi rank by Isham who carried our bags and guided us through the narrow streets  Close to Medina, 15 mins walk. We were shown the way once, and it was all very clearly explained by one of the staff, Isham again.  Actually Isham's a bit of a legend...very helpful, friendly, looking out for us, and telling us his stories of meeting Kirsty Alsop and Phil Spencer!  The mobile phone we were given in case we got lost was a great idea! Didn't need to;5
We arrived a few days before my daughters 21st and when we checked in at the desk we were told that we were going to be upgraded to a suite for my daughters birthday and she was given a complimentary breakfast coupon for the tick tick diner. When we got up to the suite on the 23rd floor we were amazed to find we had a view of the Empire State and Madison Square Garden! The suite was a little dated but very clean, the bedroom was relatively quiet because it was set back from the road and the beds were lovely a comfortable, especially the pillows! The hotel is very central and right next to Penn Station, so no need to walk very far.   I would like to thank The New Yorker for the upgrade and making my daughters 21st a birthday to remember!;5
We stayed in the Riad April 1st until the 4th. I will not go into how perfect the staff is, and how beautiful and comfortable the Riad is...everyone has already done such an amazing job reviewing this place! I will just say that all reviews are completely 100% correct! Valentina and Cinzia, and everyone else who's name escapes me at the moment...do everything in their power to make sure your stay is perfect from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave (even though you don't really want to!)  I highly recommend the airport transfer to the Riad. Someone will come out to meet you and walk you through the MAZE (not kidding) to the Riad. It is so hard to imagine that in the middle of such confusing walls and twists and turns, there is a door that leads you into Paradise!  We;5
Outstanding staff every time! So attentive and gracious ... Killer floral arrangements throughout the lobby and restaurants... This last stay really made us feel at home.. It's nice to be made so comfortable and remain stress free.. Kudos to all that are employed by this property!;5
"Sourced this Hotel from Expedia and even though it's not in the ""heart"" of LA it was certainly an excellent choice. We thoroughly enjoyed our 5 days and had a fabulous room looking out towards Universal Studios - very impressed with decor, room amenities, comfort of beds(awesome),cleanliness of room, size of bathroom, Crabtree & Evelyn bathroom amenities,coffee maker etc.  This was one of 14 Hotels we stayed in on a recent world trip and it was by far the best for the price. We ate breakfast most mornings and had the evening buffett (available over weekends) twice. I have never seen so much food, the variety of culturally different dishes, the presentation of the food and the quality of ingredients were exceptional. The service was also pretty good in the restaurant and the";5
I always prefer living with Hilton. So when I was planning my LA trip Hilton was my first choice because it was real gut next to the Universal Studios.  Staff was very courteous at Front desk as well as House keeping to room service. Always smiling, always helpful.  My wife had a shoe bite and we were out of Band-aid. Front desk lady helped us out with Band-aids and Alcohol patch.  This hotel is right next to universal studios and there is a Shuttle service every 15 minutes until 9 PM. Very convenient.  We ordered in-room breakfast during our stay. It was delivered right on time. It was good and helped us get ready for the exciting day ahead.  A must stay place to all LA visitors, specially if you have Universal studios in your itinerary.;5
We had spent 6 hrs moving into Fordham - we had booked a different hotel because I had points. That hotel gave us a handicapped room even though we booked 4 days in advance and had a full choice of rooms. They said bc it was a third party we were low priority. The shower handle was not adjustable- therefore we would have to kneel or sit  to take a shower. We checked out and I returned to a sure thing .. and that was the Empire. Not only were we considered equal, luis surprised us. We have stayed at the empire in a queen room about 7 other nights and the fact that they would utilize a room to make a guest feel special rather than let it go empty on a Monday night just sold me on staying there whenever possible;5
I stayed here for 2 days with my 9 year old son, We had a Double Queen room on the 2nd floor.. The room was inviting and bright.. The staff was very Nice and answered all of my questions Even the maids would greet you as you walked down the hall. The one I would like to give great thanks to is the women that cooks the omelettes in the morning for complimentary breakfast.. she was smiling and did an awesome job at whatever she was doing. Started my day off great!!Top knotch! Good Hire Hollywood Hotel. We will be back;5
We booked an Alcove room and we really enjoyed our stay even though only for 1 night. The view from the room was absolutely spectacular and the room interior was great and newly upgraded. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel staff even left a gift basket for us as a Hilton Honors Elite member which was very thoughtful. I would highly recommend this hotel for those that are looking for accommodations for their visit to Universal City.;5
"I was fortunate to be able to attend the Westminster Dog Show a week ago. Also lucky to stay at the New Yorker Hotel. It is very centrally located, and perfect for functions at Madison Square Garden. There were many dogs staying at the hotel. That was the fun part, seeing them. But the place was clean as a whistle and in a week's time I heard a dog bark only once. Very quiet. We had the choice of two bathrooms or a view. Having two bathrooms was a godsend. Lovely to have the choice. There was no evidence that there were many animals in the hotel. The dogs were pottied in the basement. Exceptionally clean hotel with excellent security. The ""Tick Tock"" diner is connected for easy breakfasts and the hotel has two restaurants, one Italian and the other a Steak house. Both good. But";5
My GF and I stayed at the Empire hotel 2 weeks ago and had the time of our lives! Natalia the supervisor was very kind! The location was amazing, central but not too busy like times sq, clean rooms, BEST bed i've had in a hotel, overall - I'd come back there in a heartbeat;5
The Ameritania is an excellent hotel in the heart of Broadway. Only one street above the Metro Station and walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. It is like a boutique hotel, well decorated and very chick. I really enjoyed my stay there.;5
This was a 10 week trip in US, 7 driving the southwest. Seeing friends & visiting favourite plCes & new ones. We stayed at The Hyatt San Francisco on arrival & Hyatt at LAX before flying back to Australia. Both properties are in great areas close to airports. Good restaurants & bars. Very comfortable rooms & friendly helpful staff. Easy check in & out.;5
During my call to the 1800 number yesterday, my experience was not very well. The 1st Rep did not really know how to help me and just had me on hold until I was transfer to Neida and let me tell you if she is not the best in there at what she do i don't know who is. She heard me out and she went above and beyond to make sure my needs were met. The level of service her and her team provided exceeded my expectations, I mean we were back and forth for like 2 hours so I really appreciate great customer service especially during these stressful times. I felt like I knew her she was so kool and I hope to meet her during my stay.;5
Just a short walk from universal. This hotel is very nice, clean modern.  The pool area is spacious and quiet and a big thank you to the girl at the pool bar who looked after everyone.  Certainly worth staying here.;5
Convenient for LA business at an affordable price.  Self park is confusing - but once worked out itâs great.  Food & Bev was as expected in a Hyatt.  Room clean amenities nice.  No complaints from me.  .....;5
There arenât enough positive adjectives to describe this WONDERFUL Riad. A beautiful, calm oasis in the Medina. The service is the best I have ever experienced - every single member of the team were exceptional and they did everything to ensure we as two women felt comfortable and had the best experience during our time in Morocco. The Riad and itâs rooms are stunning - we were very kindly upgraded to a suite for our last night following a trip to the Sahara Desert. The food was delicious. Location perfect. Donât look elsewhere, book Riad Kheirredine - you donât regret it.;5
The Ameritania Hotel was excellent.  The value was very good.  The staff was most helpful.  Jeff, the bellman was very helpful with directions and storing our luggage.  We were able to leave it at the hotel before and after our stay. Yassin at the front desk was very friendly.  They called my cell as soon as our room was ready, about an hour before check in.  The room was efficient, clean and the bathroom was modern and also very clean.  The location could not have been better as we were there for a play. I will look for a room at the Ameritania the next time we visit the city.  Will also recommend to our friends.;5
We had a very nice and friendly experience during our brief visit in the Regency Lounge at the Hyatt in LA. The lounge was very clean and well kept. But what really caught our attention was the warm and friendliest staff that was serving us.  Ms. Guadalupe connected with us like family, made us feel right at home. Again, thanks so much, Lupe for making us smile.;5
Cannot recommend enough. The room was beautiful, the food was delicious and the staff so friendly and helpful.  To stay in Marrakech itself was a fantastic experience.  If you want the most amazing stay in a most amazing city - stay here.  Exceeded our expectations - we loved it!;5
Amazing location for fashion week!  Right across from Lincoln Center.  Also a great location for food and walking distance to Times Square/Broadway Theaters.  The bar in the lobby is gorgeous and the restaurant on the mezzanine has great food and cocktails.  I would definitely stay here again!;5
Location is excellent, whether walking to Central  Park, Ground Zero or to the East River. Access to LIRR or Subway is immediate. Comfortable lobby if you need a place to relax and watch people. We would stay here again.;5
This is an excellent airport hotel. The hotel has been updated in recent years and overall is nice. Closest hotel to Los Angeles International Airport. There is a shuttle which has a regular schedule however the hotel is also walkable from the airport (short walk). Of you only have a small carryon luggage, I would recommend walking. Overall, very satisfied with my stay at the Hyatt Regency LAX.;5
We spent a long weekend in Marrakech and opted for the #1 on Tripadvisor - Riad Kheirredine. We are so glad that we did. It was a lovely haven in the hustle and bustle of the city. The staff really do bend over backwards to make their guests have the best experience of Marrakech possible - from booking restaurants (we loved Azar) and hammam (Heritage Spa), to escorting guests to and from the centre of the medina. From the provision of the mobile phone, to delicious meals (hearty breakfasts and a Moroccan multi-course feast) and a tranquil room with a very comfortable bed (Eucalyptus), the Riad caters for its guests' needs. There is no TV, but who needs TV when there is so much else to do, and we were asked in advance to pay for our stay in cash, which wasn't a problem.;5
My stay was wonderful !!! The food was really good, much better than most Hotels. And the staff, especially Marine at the pool, was amazing ! I have already booked my next stay. Itâs rare to have such a great experience these days. It was truly wonderful;5
I love the jane hotel. We were on a budget so opted for a bunk room. Yes the room is tiny, but It was well laid out with TVs on both levels, air con, fresh water, towels and robes. The shared bathroom was always clean and nice.  There's a lovely roof terrace to have a drink and a restaurant on the ground floor which did good brunch and coffee.  This restaurant is in a great location. The meat packing district has loads of great bars and restaurants. We loved chelsea market which was a 5 minute walk.;5
This hotel was very nice and clean. It was also very convenient to  Times Square and local restaurants and to the subway. This was our second time to stay here and it was very nice. Will definitely be back to stay again!;5
I went to NYC for four nights by myself and was very pleased with my experience there. I am a 23yr old female and felt very comfortable there. I have stayed in several hostels in the city and this was the best deal. I only had a basic room with no bathroom or tv, but with it just being me, I didn't need those things. Anyways you do not need a tv while visiting nyc! You have the whole city to explore and watch. Having a basic room at that price was exactly what I wanted. If I can save money by not having a private bathroom, then I definitely want that, especially if I'm just traveling by myself. The shared bathrooms where kept clean anyways so that was nice. I had lots of storage space within the room for clothing or whatever. The thing that stood out most to me however was how;5
Nice room on the 33rd floor with view of Empire State building.  Large, clean 2 bedroom great mattresses and lots of pillows!  Easy check-in, close to blue line, A C E. Security at elevator.  Across from Madison Square Garden.;5
We chose this location to be near Madison Square Garden and to have an easy walk to Broadway theaters. The view was great from the terrace off of our room. The steakhouse downstairs was great and served dinner until 10:30 PM--very helpful. There was a new bagel place across the street that was as good as any other bagel place in the City.;5
"I stayed three nights nights during a conference - what a treat!   My room was large, and had an interesting curved window line; I get so tired of boxy rooms that it was a nice change. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom as well. The counter was large enough for toiletries. Having robe and slippers was also s o nice. And, I appreciated not having a stocked minivan. It is too easy to grab junk food otherwise!  Wireless was free and reasonably fast. The self parking garage offered easy access.   I also appreciated the very attentive staff, highly accessible and friendly throughout.  This hotel is undergoing renovations and so there is plastic and construction ... that did not interfere with my comfort.";5
Would recommend this hotel.Days Inn Hotel is great  value. Great location, within walking distance to Central Park and 15 mins subway to Times Square. Our rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable. All the staff friendly and helpful.;5
Hotel staff are welcoming & friendly. Fantastic location. Overall great service superb food and drink. Comfortable room and bed, great nights sleep. Staff very helpful and top class service from all staff;5
Great service from the hotel, with helpful staff. Location was close to all the areas we wanted to visit. Rooms were clean and luxurious to where we felt absolutely comfortable. Pil and Angelica helped out a lot with all my questions and provided A1 service for myself and others. Would come back to this hotel when visiting this hotel.;5
I'm Back!! Back in The New York Groove!!!! Had another great experience at the Ameritania Hotel in Times Square!! My last visit here in January was matched by yet again a delightful stay. The front desk staff was friendly and professional just liked I remember . Janet at the desk was very helpful in regards in helping me extend my stay. Emily, a manger I believe was amazingly friendly and welcoming!!!! The room was exceptionally  clean and fresh!!! Great price for a great location!!! Can't wait to be back in NYC and the Ameritania. Hopefully, it won't take as long!!;5
This particular HILTON is one of the best hiltons in town . Clean rooms, great food , and overall service is excellent. There is one particular person that made our stay extra welcomed. HECTOR MARTINEZ . He went above and beyond our expectations . As a parent of 4 kids it can be a hustle to Move around ,but Hector directed us to the right way in our trip , our car was ready in less than what we thought , and also send us out with complimentary bottles of water. We will definately be back;5
We really enjoyed our first trip to LA. The weather is so nice in November and the Hollywood Hotel is centrally located to many attractions. Pil & Angelica at the front desk provided quick service and great hospitality.;5
Amazing hotel and service. Upon the morning of arrival we were offered breakfast, which was very welcome. Breakfast was great, Moroccan pancakes, juice, sweets, jam, honey, fruits, ham, sausages and they can make you eggs and omelets â wonderful. We were always given free water bottles when leaving the hotel for sightseeing or lemonade when staying in the room - nice touch.   The hotel is located inside the Medina which means you can only access it by foot â It takes 5 minutes (fast paced) through the narrow streets from the nearest taxi stop. This, however, gives you the authentic and true nature/adventure of Marrakech which you will probably not find by staying in one of the larger hotel chains outside the city walls. If you want the real deal, Riad Kheirredine is the place;5
Absolutely amazing experience at the riad. It's worth the travel to Marrakech!! The Medina can be a challenge in your first days, but with the help provided by the staff of the riad, you won't have any problems. They take you on your first day to Jemaa el Fna, and they show you the way back and give you a mobile phone in case you lose on the streets. The riad is a little, comfortable, beautiful palace, and the staff is unbelievable. Everybody. They work a lot, and the make you feel comfortable, making your stay easy and pleasant. We'd like to mention, above all, Khalid, who was our waiter and is truly a real nice person. Our son loves him!! And we do too. Well, we've loved our stay at the Kheirredine!!  PS: Meals were espectacular!! Dont leave without trying the tajines.;5
Excellent stay again at a Premier Inn.  The room was clean, exceptionally quiet for central London, well located and staff were very helpful and friendly.  We stay in a lot of premier inns and can always rely on this brand for consistency.  Thanks for the discretionary upgrade, though the rooms are very much on parr with one another.   Thank you.;5
We could not be more pleased with our stay at the Empire and recommend it highly.  We look forward to another stay here in the future.  Location and customer service were both beyond reproach. A special thank you to Brandon at the Front Door -- so kind and helpful.;5
The website doesn't do this hotel justice.  My aunt was visiting from New York and I wasn't sure she would be happy.  Not only was she happy but so was I.  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  The rooms are spacious and the carpet was so soft.  The hallways smelled good and were bright and welcoming.  The lobby is beautiful too.  The Italian restaurant in the lobby was excellent and not over priced for such a nice restaurant. The food and service was perfect.  The location is across the street from Penn Station.  Very convenient from and too JFK, LAG, and Newark.  Pharmacy, shopping, Madison Square Garden are all within one block from the hotel.;5
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Marrakech and my stay at the Riad Kheirredine added immeasurably to it.  While many other reviewers have already covered many of the aspects of the facility, Iâll try and cover a few other aspects.  I booked my room directly with the Riad and would advise others to do likewise.  The management of the Riad arranged our airport transfers which really reduced our stress on arrival.  Upon reaching the gate into the city walls, we were met by an employee who escorted us into the labyrinthine streets and alley ways that are an inherent part of Marrakechâs charm.    The Riad is a multi-level structure surrounding two courtyards.  A terrace on top gives views out over the city to the Atlas Mountains in the distance.  Everything within the Riad is spic;5
The staff was second to none. Also the location made it very easy to get around the greater LA area. I would definitely give them 2 thumbs up. Keep up the great work and client centered interactions. Thank you again.;5
We initially wanted to stay at the Waldorf (which we love) but it was booked out so looked for another historical hotel.  The New Yorker fitted the bill - great history, with a small museum display, and an iconic building.  Our room had a postcard view looking straight at the skyline including the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. We were close to many subway lines (including the PATH to NJ), 3 blocks from the Empire State, next to Madison Square Garden (where we were going) plus close to many shops including 7th Ave (Fashion Avenue). It has a 24 hour diner, Tick Tock - not the best food but handy for late night snacks and drinks.  We got everywhere we wanted to go very quickly.  Will always stay there from now on mainly because of the convenient location.;5
Our stay at the Riad Kheirredine was even better than expected.  From our check-in to check-out everything was amazing.  The breakfast each morning was excellent as well as the evening dinner menu, which also offers the local wine. The rooms were extremely clean and well kept. Heating and cooling is offered in each room as well as an evening turn-down service. They provided bottled water for drinking and brushing teeth.  The shower was very comfortable and the towels soft.    The staff took the time to get to know us and assist us in planning excursions, drivers, and guides. They were very helpful and always took care of any request immediately.  They did provide us onsite daily laundry which was much appreciated. There was always fresh fruit and roses.    Each wall and space;5
We booked our stay at Riad Kheirredine through the recommendation of a family friend who visited Marrakech a few months before us and enjoyed their time at Riad Kheirredine very much. We were very pleased with our experience at Riad Kheirredine as well. The staff was very friendly and helpful â we could feel that they really cared about our experience and tried to make sure we had a good time.  Fresh fruit could be found at the rooftop, the lobby, and in the rooms. We ordered mint tea several times which was free of charge. Laundry service was included but we didnât need it during our stay. The food was good â big breakfast selection and everything was delicious. I also want to recommend the spa - we did the traditional hammam package to end our stay with Riad Kheirredine and we;5
This was the first time a friend and I stayed at the Empire and it was AMAZING! The staff were so welcoming and even though the elevators were a little glitchy on the day we were departing, a staff stayed in the elevator and made sure everyone was taken care.  We were greeted each time we came in (no matter the hour) and when a small mistake was made on a room service order, a fruit plate was brought up within minutes after correcting the error. So sweet and totally not necessary.  the location of the hotel was excellent and we will both stay here again!!;5
Everything about the hotel was great room, breakfast and all staff so friendly The breakfast was amazing and such good value  Room clean and comfortable  The staff couldnât do enough for you and were so pleased to help  Location was absolutely fantastic;5
Staff were friendly,hotel was very clean,comfortable and exactly as described. The location was ideal,close to the subway,shops, coffee shops . restaurant within the hotel,stayed for breakfast the first day, food was great however extremely pricey.;5
Came here on a business trip with my husband. Room was clean and hotel was close enough to where I needed to be for work. When I was not working, we decided to do some sight seeing..the doorman, Tommy, was very sweet and helpful. He let   us know what to definitely experience in our short stay and maybe what to save for our next visit to NYC. We will surely be returning to the Empire Hotel!;5
The service was good, I like the guys at the door, funny and helpsome. And at night we went to the bar and Javier served us. If you donât live here go here anyway because Javier is the best bartender in town!?;5
Easy check in process, great location (coffee shops & restaurants in walking distance) and room was clean (well stock with linen and addtl supplies). Would recomend and would stay here again for future travel.;5
I enjoyed the location and the hotel staffs hospitality.  Easy to get to and close to most popular NYC landmarks - Times Square, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and the subway.;5
Had the pleasure of staying at this hotel recently (2016) nice rooms, friendly staff, great location. The restaurant downstairs is great, and the lobby bar is a nice place to meet other guests. One of the staff at the bar, Mor, was particularly helpful letting us know which sights to visit. If I ever go back to NYC I will definitely stay here.;5
We are in Morocco for 2 weeks and started our trip at the riad Kherridine. I was celebrating my 50th birthday and we couldn't have asked for a better location. It is as fantastic as other reviews have mentioned - with a special highlight being Ismail who's directions were indispensable. We liked the fact the riad was a bit further from the main square with the walk there being an interesting part of the day - it was also nice to get back to the calm after a mad day in the soucks. Valantina was a wonderful host - she were happy to chill some champagne we had bought and also presented a lovely bouquet of roses with the birthday breakfast. We will definitely return !!;5
Amazing staff that go out of their way to accommodate your requests, everyone is friendly and helpful. The hotel has a fantastic location that lets you explore the city easily and trendy decor for you to relax in when you return. Love this hotel!;5
We booked this hotel as looking for a good reasonably priced hotel in the centre of LA was proving difficult, we spent hours looking at hotels which were quite pricey but didn't look that great. As we had a car we decided to stay here as the hotel looked great and was a brilliant price  so we would drive into LA. This proved to be a brilliant decision. The hotel is around 3 or 4 miles drive from parking near to the Chinese Theatre, parking for the whole day on a proper carpark cost $5!! The Hilton was superb and we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. ALL of the hotel staff we came into contact with were a credit to the hotel, just lovely. It is in a lovely safe area within a short walk to Universal City where we ate at night a couple of times. There is a free shuttle bus;5
I had occasion to visit Staten Island to attend an Army Military Ball and chose the Navy Lodge, on Staten Island, for my lodging. Since this was my first visit to the Lodge in two years, I was immediately impressed with updates that have been made to the grounds, lobby and rooms, in my absence. All aspects of the Lodge were both visually and functionally fresh.  Upon my arrival, I inquired about extending my two day stay to three, I was pleasantly surprised that my request was quickly granted.  This has seldomed happened in my travels, but came about through the efforts of the desk clerk in checking through the day's reservations.  The entire staff- desk, cleaning and manager conspired to welcome me to the Lodge.  The room accomodations and cleanliness were top notch, resulting;5
Wow! Just left Marrakech and I can't say enough about this Riad! The service was by far the best I've received from a hotel (and I travel a lot internationally).  They were attentive from beginning to end, giving us a local phone to use in case we got lost, helped us find obscure things like bubble wrap for our souvenirs, and helping us book and reschedule excursions.  Sara and Elena were super helpful with any questions we had! Also, the night guard, Ahmed is one of the most wonderful people my boyfriend and I have ever met! We had a really late dinner one night, and Ahmed came and met us at the taxi drop off area to make sure we got home safe! Everyone working at the Riad went above and beyond to ensure that we had the best experience possible.  The Riad is super cute and cozy;5
The Empire Hotel is a magnificent Hotel , with a great location and wonderfull Staff. Very kind, present and always there to help. i will high reccomanded to anyone love the spirit of the upper west side of Ny, Museums, cinemas. Theathers shops .. restaurants are around the corner . Very nice, safe and quite at night. Loved being there.;5
We were intrigued by the mixed reviews but wanted nice (but not necessarily luxurious) accomodation in a good location. This definitely proved to be the case. The motel was very comfortable and had a lovely courtyeard for relaxing. Although the room balconies opened overlooking the courtyard we did not experience any noise while trying to sleep. The location is also convenient to a number of cool areas. We were very pleased with our choice and would have liked to stay longer! Oh, and my husband loved the omlette bar at breakfast.;5
A classic Art Deco property close to all attractions, this hotel was quiet, cosy and warm for my last night in NYC after a trip around the country. The room was well-appointed, elegant and very clean. The bathroom was a bit small, and so I got the floor wet when showering, but the fittings were authentico Art Deco and the addition of a large closet was welcome. Downstairs the Tick Tock Diner was good to revisit and experience some classic American diner food. The check-in staff were very friendly, and I really enjoyed my stay. The wifi signal was very strong, and the TV a good quality picture. One small issue was being booked onto the SuperShuttle by the hotel when I thought I was being booked onto their own airport shuttle service - I could have booked myself for less! Was a;5
the theme park.  The hotel offered an executive breakfast for members which was pretty nice as it included a donut bar, ice cream and sushis on top of the usual continental which is great for asians, they also have a universal breakfast at a top up with a range of hot items. Tina in the restaurant was great too. Would I come back? Definitely!  Tip: drive up to the lobby and unload your suitcases as the self park is quite far with carpeted flooring from the hotel lobby / room elevator so it can be tiring.;5
I stayed there for one night. It was my first night in NYC I read a reviews about this hotel I wasn't sure at first. But went I got there 2 hours before the checkout time the guy at the reception was persons super cool and friendly he gave me a room in the second floor which I didn't like I asked if I can get another one he immediately gave another one in the 5th floor with little views to the river. I knew it was gonna v small and I didn't care. The room was v cute with tv, radio iPod player( v convenient as I forgot my iPhone charger) and a big fan also c convenient as outside that week was extremely hot 35'c. Sharing the showers wasnt really a problem I quiet like walking through the corridors in just a towel lol most of guest are young tho so not a problem if ur towel slips;5
We have just returned from The Ameritania, Location is fantastic, Staff excellent, Rooms excellent with a great shower, Bed great and comfortable, What do you want in a hotel in NYC, we left the hotel at nine returned at six most evenings, quick change then dinner, it was just a place to sleep and right in the heart of theatre land.  Nothing was to much bother for the staff with knowledgeable door staff always willing to help and advise, and off the negative comments on here I really don't understand, is there nicer hotels, probably, is their nicer hotels at the same price as this hotel, I would doubt it, try it, you will not be disappointed;5
Queen rooms uncomfortably small for two. King room adequate. Pleasant, professional, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Good restaurants, Central Park & subway stop within walking distance. We always stay here.;5
Fantastic location, very clean rooms eoth everything you need, all staff very attentive and made you feel welcome from the word go, didnt eat here butwe had some drinks which were very reasonably priced compared to out and about. Cannot fault and would 100% stay here again;5
Four adults in room with two double beds.  Room was small, but clean and could accommodate us. We chose the most affordable room and it worked out well.  It's price point compared to other NYC hotels is really good and it's reliably clean. The location is great, right near Penn Station.  It's great if you are taking Amtrak in to NYC, and it's convenient for taking public transit around the city.  Staff are professional and friendly.  The bag check is great for early arrival and final day's stay after check out.  We ate at the Tick Tock for breakfast and got a decent quick breakfast.  There are a few good places around to grab quick eats.  We visited NYU and did some sight seeing so we didn't spend a whole lot of time at the hotel.;5
Stayed on 29 August to 5 September I've booked this hotel for one week for my wife Birthday The rooms are very clean and tidy a reasonable size The staff are very friendly and helpful I've got to say my favourite person was Amelia on the front desk She was fantastic person I will definitely book/hotel again I was in a good location and right next door was a cafe call tick tock we had breakfast a couple times people go onto TripAdvisor and look at the hotel for negative reviews I will say they were not anything negative that I can say about this hotel and I was staying in room 2106 and I want to say thank you to the housekeepers for their hard work because they deserve it.;5
Our room was 815 and was a nice clean room with a nice king size bed.  However, we did have problems with the air conditioning.  We called room service and they immediately sent a maintenance employee to our room.  The employee was the Head of the HVAC system for the hotel.  His name was Adam Ponce.  When Adam arrived at our room he introduced himself to me and my wife.  He shook our hand and we introduced ourselves to him.  I have never met a nicer and more friendlier maintenance employee at a hotel ever.  He told us he would either get the air conditioner working or move us to another room.  As it turned out he was able to get the air conditioner working very quickly and the room cooled down to a very comfortable temperature.  Adam was just a great employee and it was a;5
Stayed here for 7 nights in December beautiful room with a great view. The room was renovated with a good size walk in shower. The location is ideal with Macy's on 34th Street and Penn Station and a walk down 8th Ave to Central Park. The service is superb would recommend this hotel to anyone.;5
Great Location, rooms were very clean, rooftop bar was so much fun .Pasqualie at the front desk was super helpful and so kind he made check in and check out so easy. I will definately return.  Lorraine;5
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this wonderful art deco hotel, with stylish details in room and public spaces. Very convenient location in central Manhattan with great views from higher stories.  Spacious common waiting space in lobby. Sufficient elevators and no waiting. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Amenities including internet excellent; room cleaned every day.";5
We stayed at the Empire Hotel on May 3rd 2013 to celebrate my birthday. We had tickets to see the Rascals on Broadway. Our room was immaculate & cozy. Nice view of Lincoln Center.  Julia's service was outstanding, she made us feel very comfortable.   I would reccomend the Empire Hotel to anyone staying in New York City. We will definitely being staying again.;5
Iâve stayed here a few times and each time is better than the last. Great location and lovely staff. The food and atmosphere in the restaurant is great. The hotel itself is located next to the London Eye so ideally place for tourist visit. Weâll be back soon. Thank you.;5
I had a 24 hour layover between flights and chose the Hyatt--one of several hotels on Century Boulevard leading into LAX. Highly recommended. Clean, bright, modern dÃ©cor with outstanding customer service. Some noise from departing aircraft, but convenience to the airport outweighs this minor issue. Free shuttle. A restful place to lay-over in Los Angeles.;5
Great people working the front desk! My family had a great time and the staff was very accommodating.  10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Hollywood.  Check out the Hollywood hotel you wonât regret it!;5
We got to the hotel almost 10 pm and were met by very accommodating staff.  Housekeeping staff were likewise very accommodating and so easy to talk to.   Location was excellent, just a stones throw away from the Penn station, just walking distance to the bus station and of course walking distance to all the shops, restaurants, even daily mass services and the post office and subway...Couldn't ask for anything more. The only downside, which couldn't be helped was that although we were on the 40th floor, we didn't have a view because of the construction right outside our window! Best of all was the supply of coffee, tea, soda and bottled water in our rooms.;5
Riad Kheirredine is amazingly beautiful as you can see from the photos with a diverse set of beautiful rooms at various prices. The quiet and luxurious corners within the property, including the rooftop deck with pool and loungers and the spa, invite relaxation.  What sets this property apart, however, is the service---in the wonderful chaos of the Medina, the hospitality can make or break your visit.  The entire staff from the owner to the masseuse to the porters to the laundry manager are incredibly welcoming, and seem to know what you need before you're aware of it. We've never been treated as well in our travels as at Kheirredine, and feel like we have left friends (thanks, Elena, Lamia, Youssaine, Brahmin, Ahmen, Anthonio and everyone else).  This is the place to stay in;5
this small hotel is clean comfortable and a value for New York City.  Literately STEPS away from the grand street subway.  This hotel has free wifi , flat screen TV modern bed linens. The young men at the front desk are very polite and helpful.  My stay here was great!;5
Lovely hotel, very clean and modern, family friendly and central.  Special mention of staff member Jeff who is the hotel porter. He is professional, friendly and helpful.  Thank you we have enjoyed our visit and would definitely come back!;5
Maria chavez was an amazing waiter to have. She was great to socialize with, especially since she is fluent in Spanish. I had a great time visiting this restaurant and I am definitely coming back again. This was hands down the best service I have had in the past 5 years. Once again amazing restaurant and staff! I highly, highly recommend you visit if you get the chance!;5
"We were in town for the annual Westminster Kennel Club dog show which we attend every year.  We have stayed all over The City but this year we were bringing a dog to show and had been told The New Yorker was the best place to stay.  We have to agree, although I don't think you need to bring a dog to think so.  Our room was clean and well appointed, maid service very good, loved the fact there were three places to dine within the hotel, the Tick Tock Diner, a very good Italian Trattoria and the upscale steak house Butcher & Banker.  Also very convenient was the coffee bar in the Lobby which we took advantage of every morning and brought up to our room.  The hotel outdid itself offering a designated room as a potty area for the dogs, a $50 ""paw pass"" was obtained, the room was";5
We visited Hilton Universal for Memorial Day weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Universal Studios and CitiWalk and just 1 metro stop away from Hollywood.  This Hilton offers the same comfortable luxury as so many others, has a heated outdoor pool and offers incredible brunch and evening buffets and has a complimentary shuttle to the park if you are not up for the short walk.  It is also a stop on the Hop On Hop Off tour.  Staff is friendly and most are very helpful.  The only less than stellar interaction I had was with a concierge who didn't seem to know anything about LA attractions like the California ScienCenter.;5
Our family has stayed at the Hollywood Hotel during both of our trips to LA. We thoroughly enjoy the service that the staff provides to each of its guests. Pil, the manager, is incredibly attentive and more than willing to go out of his way to help at any time. Hugo, the omelette guy, is always smiling and works as hard as anyone Iâve ever met. The rest of the staff are just as great as Pil and Hugo. Room was always clean, breakfast is great, and the location is perfect. You simply cannot beat the Hollywood Hotel for the price anytime or anywhere. Thank you!!  - The Winters Family;5
We are a couple in our mid twenties and we stayed at the Riad Kheirredine for 3 nights in early September. The riad was a stunning oasis of calm within the medina. Our room was decorated in an authentic Moroccan style and was very comfortable. However, the jewel in road kheirredine's crown is its staff (particularly Marco, the interpreter/guide). The staff were all extremely welcoming and the service was excellent. We ate in the riad on our second night and I would recommend doing so. However, if the riad is not serving dinner that night then Marco and the other staff are able to recommend several very nice alternatives nearby or further towards Jemma El-Fna. We were also given a Moroccan mobile phone to use in case we got lost in the Medina or needed to contact the hotel staff.;5
We spent 4 nights of absolute luxury at the Riad feeling extremely well looked after and pampered. Nothing was too much trouble for the attentive staff who did everything to make our stay perfect and memorable.;5
The Empire Hotel was great! I traveled here from Buffalo, NY with my boyfriend. Check in took seconds, the staff was very helpful to point us in the direction of great restaurants and night life. Our room was small but we only spent time in the room if we were sleeping or changing to go out, so not a big deal at all. Every day we had new towels, new toiletries and our bed was made up. The hotel is in a great location, only a 15 minute walk to times square and seconds to central park. The mini-fridge in your room is expensive, but there's a small variety store down the road that you can stock up on water and booze if need be. My only complaints, although minor, would be that wi-fi isn't free (about $16 CAD/day) and the pool was not as big as advertised. However, I would;5
The Hollywood hotel is very great hotel for its prices. The rooms are so big and clean. The hotel has very friendly staff. Pil is the nicest guy ever, he even took a picture with us. I have to say very surprise the hotel doesnât look as nice from the outside ( a lot of homeless).   But you feel very safe inside. Will return.;5
This riad is largely run and run extremely well by Valentina, a charming young Italian woman.  Valentina, and the staff are always at your service. Valentina herself is fluent in English, Italian, French, and who knows which other languages.  Lots of hotels take good care of their guests, but not like Riad Kheirredine does.  The Marakech Medina where this riad is located is a maze of streets and alleys and a thousand ways to get lost.  No problem:  When you want to go somewhere, Valentina will send a multi-lingual guide with you.  When you're ready try it on your own, she'll give you a cell phone with her number and the guide's numbers already built in so when you get lost, you just call and someone will come guide you back.  When you do get back, you'll be offered tea coffee,;5
The staff were extremely friendly and were happy to help with any needs. My interactions with the staff were friendly, personal and this was due to them being very approachable. The hotel room was clean and comfy and check in and out was easy and stress-free. Besides the queue for the luggage holding, it was impeccable!;5
I do t often leave reviews but I feel itâs important to take the time to recognize when exceptional service is received. After having to leave our previous hotel at 1am due to room issues, Matthew at Premier Inn was an absolute hero. We arrived and explained our situation and he could not have been more helpful. He arranged accommodation for our family of 5 and sorted out everything we needed for a pleasant stay. The vote itself is central, clean and has everything we needed for our family. Overall, the move to Premier Inn turned out to be a substantial bonus, despite the earlier stress of moving hotels. We would definitely stay again.;5
It was my first stay at Riad Kheirredine and I am sure it will not be the last! The property is immaculate and the staff went above and beyond our expectations.  We spent only a weekend but we wished to stay longer: breakfast was homemade and freshly served each morning anywhere we wanted to, due to the actual restrictions we had dinner there each evening but we did not complain at all: the culinary experience was simply delicious. Words will never be enough to describe our stay, we will keep on recommend it to everyone we know and we will be back as soon as we will be able to get a vacation. Really looking forward to be back;5
Empire's employees were great especially Maria (front desk) she is Awesome, if you need anything go see her, she will definitely take care of you.  The location is great especially with New York traffic, walking distance is not a problem. The room that I received was very spacious, clean and quiet.  I highly recommend this hotel when you visit New York.;5
I stayed there for 3 nights and I loved it. The bathrooms were always clean and never too busy. Close to High Line Park and Hudson Bike Path + free bicycles from the hotel. Very friendly stuff and the front desk manager as well. I will definitely stay again!!;5
Wow wow wow!! 5 star service at all times.. staff are so friendly and canât do enough for u!   Everything you could think of they are there, restaurants, bookings, taxis. They even give you a mobile phone to ring then when you need a taxi or if u get lost.   Lovely little terraces, feels like your own boutique little hotel with a space of your own. You can have breakfast at any time which is perfect.   Donât forget to book a spa treatment we got the Royal package and it was brilliant.;5
We stopped at the Empire hotel for our wedding in December 2016 along with 36 other guests for a weeklong stay. We found the bar, lobby area and roof top bar to be amazing, we got married in a church nearby however the Empire hotel helped the wedding planner along the way by providing myself (the bride) and my father a different exit out of the hotel so none of the guests could see etc. We found the front desk to be very helpful. It was definitely worth upgrading our room to junior king suite which provided enough room for the bridesmaids and bride to get ready on the morning of the wedding. We had breakfast in the restaurant a couple of times which was buffet and was very good and had quite a few cocktails in the bar which was great and very sociable. The loaction of the hotel;5
Stayed here for 5 nights in September and would highly recommend this hotel, will hopefully be back. Beautifully decorated, gorgeous decent sized room and bathroom. Clean and cleaned daily. Location perfectly between Central Park and Times Square.;5
We are writing this review to express our appreciation for the exceptional service we received during our stay last week at the Hilton Universal. One piece of our luggage was left at the rental car company at LAX and Mr. Danny Llaga and staff at valet and concierge services went out of their way to make sure it was retrieved and back to our room within 24 hours (even though it was Sunday afternoon). We visit Los Angeles 2-3 times a year and always stay at the Hilton Universal. It is people like Mr. Llaga and staff why we keep coming back to Hilton Universal City.;5
I can not say enough about the staff! All were helpful and kind! Michael, in particular,helped me with all of my many questions! Breakfast wad great! The room was very clean and so big and the decor is very modern.  I will definitely go back to this hotel! It is also very close to the metro. =);5
Me my wife of 3 weeks and daughter visited here for one week beginning of March from start to leaving on the  last day the staff from cleaners, to mourad and the rest of the doormen, the front desk staff and management and finally Javier the bar man they were so friendly and helpful. We were on our honeymoon and when we arrived there was a card congratulating us and a bottle of champagne nice touch it was also our daughter's 16th while we were there and they did the same for her a couple of bottles of pop and a muffin.  Javier the bar man was so friendly we had quite a few drinks with this guy ( also really funny) overall fantastic holiday fantastic hotel . Also walking distance to time square and central park if we ever decide to go back to Newyork this hotel will be my first;5
We had a 4 day break to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary with friends. We booked Eucalyptus and friends had the Amber room both were great. It has all been said before. We have stayed in many lovely place and Hotels but all could learn about true customer service from Valentina and all the Staff, they made the break. All trips were booked for us and worked like clockwork. Nothing was too much trouble and the rose petals in our room on our anniversary day was from the heart.;5
Being music fans, my boyfriend and I enjoy visiting New York on a regular basis but have usually stayed at another hotel on Lexington. This trip, knowing how much time weâd be spending at Lincoln Center it seemed appropriate to stay somewhere closer to that location. Hotel Empire cannot be beat in regards to locationâdirectly across the street from Lincoln Center ! As a matter of fact, our room window looked directly across at it. We will be staying at this hotel from now on. Checking-in was a smooth and easy process with an informative and friendly desk staff. Although the rooftop bar sounded tempting it seems to get very crowded in the elevator lines up to it so we opted to lounge in the lobby bar. It did not disappoint. Thereâs a restaurant in the hotel but there are options:;5
Me and my boyfriend stayed here in January. We had a distastef with our flight due to the freak weather in New York and ended up being diverted to Washington Virginia Airport and having no luggage for the duration of our stay. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, as we got the train from Washington straight to Penn station which is next door to the hotel. There were lots of shops within walking distance which made it easier for us to replace our lost clothes and the pharmacy opposite was useful for toiletries and medication. Staff were very friendly, polite and helpful. Room was great! Smaller than expected but not small! We had a view of an office block which was illuminated in the evening. Maid service was brilliant. The hotel is beautiful in the lobby. We didnât eat;5
From beginning to end, we were happy with our choice of The Empire Hotel for Valentine's day weekend.  From Pasquale at the front desk, who was gracious and helpful at check-in...to our spacious accommodations - with a great view of the Lincoln Center and Broadway...the staff and ambience at the Lobby Bar...and the consistently friendly, helpful doormen - day or night.....can not say enough great things about this hotel.  Obviously, the location and surprising value initially drew us....but the actual experience exceeded any expectations we had prior to the visit.;5
We found this hotel off of a deal on Expedia and I have to say I was a little wary. Also a little annoyed at the $20/day facility fee when it's only a gym and my family was not going to use it. Just include it in the price, New Yorker, and call it a day! The line to check in was long and slow but I've just summarized my only two negatives. It is nicely renovated, and while the room was small, my stepkids (3) got a double room with two bathrooms--how does that happen? Our view on the 25th floor was of 34th street and not so interesting but still beautiful. The twists and turns getting to your rooom remind me of the Waldorf...love me an old hotel. Very friendly reception, clean, renovated room -- very small for getting around with four of us, but who spends time in the room in NYC;5
Matthew and the rest of the staff at the Ameritania were top notch. Not only were they all friendly and fun, they were helpful in every way they could to ensure we had the best stay possible. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to stay within walking distance of Central Park and Times Square.  We hope to be back soon!;5
We stayed at The Empire Hotel for 6 nights . Arrived late (10pm) -the check in was really fast as the front staff was really helpful .Same goes for the rest of the Empire Hotel staff which was so helpful and polite. Location is perfect , next to Central Park & Lincoln center and 2 min walk from Colombus Circle station (lines A/B/C/D). Its in a nice neiborhood , and you wont feel trapped by the skyscappers as in other options . Room was very clean and was daily taken care of . Also , both bar options (rooftop & lobby) will be your favourite drinking spot before getting back to room . Cant wait to visit again in summer months to enjoy the rooftop & swimming pool . We would like to thank Mr.Velazquez for taking care of our reservation as well as Anthony & Pasquale at the front desk;5
The location is top, the rooms are clean, the staff is super friendly especially Ham, Thileli, Glenny and Magdi. We had a lot of fun with them and they helped us whenever we had questions. Moreover the Wifi is fast and free water is always available. We werenât searching for a luxury hotel and our expectations were satisfied and we were absolutely happy.;5
We picked this hotel as it is within walking distance (or take a shuttle) for the universal studios and city walk. Nice front desk staff.  Clean, quiet spacious rooms with great views. Gift shop and Peetâs coffee stand.;5
All in all, we are very happy with our stay at the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport, and will definitely stay here again on our next visit to L.A.!  Our family of two adults and a teenager spent two nights here on a short visit to L.A. This hotel is, as far as I know, the closest one to the LAX airport. Not quite walking distance if you have a lot of luggage, but the hotel also operates a complimentary shuttle bus to the terminals.   Upon arrival the valet gave us instructions on where to park while I checked in, and check-in was quick and courteous. We used self-parking, and there was ample parking pace in the parking structure at the back of the hotel. Parking is not complimentary, but that was not expected, as this is an airport hotel! I do not remember the;5
I arrived at the Hyatt at 2:00 am LA time, 6:00 my body clock time having not eaten for 16 hours nor slept for 23 hours AND MY ONE PIECE OF LUGGAGE DIDN'T MAKE MY FLIGHT!!!  What happened next?  I was greeted at the front desk with the warm, friendly, smiling face of Jesus Rosas!!  Lucky me.  Explaining my situation he immediately pointed me in the direction of their Marketplace - still open -  for one of the most delicious sandwiches ever.  Freshly made the young woman who took my order - something like Jennifer - was all smiles despite the fact she was about to leave her early morning shift within the hour. Eagerly taking the efficient Otis elevator to my floor, the one I had requested in advance, I found the badly needed gratis toothbrush and toothpaste hanging on my door;5
We have just returned from a week long stay in a deluxe double room and are so impressed we are planning on rebooking for a short break in January. The room was more spacious than we expected in New York and all the staff were welcoming and friendly especially Jeff who helped us out with a transfer back to JFK at an excellent price.;5
I absolutely lived this hotel, the room was very clean and all the staff were so friendly. I especially liked the restaurant who do the best steak I've ever tasted! If I ever get the opportunity to go to new York again I'll be stopping here.;5
We went to Universal Studios for my son's 8th birthday. We had a magical time at the park. Kevin and Linda from the front desk added to the magic by making our stay at your Hotel just as wonderful. Great food and drinks, clean rooms, a great view and friendly staff pretty much sums up the stay. I would also like to mention the pool. Which was a great way to spend the last day of a hectic week just relaxing and mentally preparing for the return trip home. Thank you again for all of the hospitality you showed us. We hope to be back soon. The Hudlers;5
Convenient hotel within walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk. There are many restaurants and shops nearby. Traveled with just my young daughter and myself, felt very safe walking back and forth even after dark.  Hotel offers excellent buffet breakfast. Happy hour in lounge has a nice section of free appetizers.   Pool was so so, but heated which was a plus.;5
We went to three opera at the Met, a Philharmonic concert, toured both facilities and Juilliard and walked to each venue.  Took a short bus ride to a couple of other shows. This is the place to stay if you are going to Lincoln Center.;5
I am spending my last evening in Marrakech and am sad to check out tomorrow from RK. The raid was lovely and our hosts were very welcoming. Valentina at the front desk was always a delight and had great recommendations for restaurants. We were always asked if things were to our satisfaction and they certainly were. We enjoyed great service in the restaurant by Abdu. I nice service that the hotel offers is for the male employees to accompany us to the taxi stand or to the square. This was a comfort in the evenings and at the start of our stay. Ismail was especially nice and always engaging during our strolls as was Ibrahim. The only complaint I would have is that the breakfast portions as well as the one dinner we enjoyed were large portions and I did not enjoy seeing so much;5
This fabulous Riad in the middle of the Medina is a well hidden gem. Everything about it was just perfect. The rooms, the decor, the facilities but most importantly the quality of service and the attention to clients. They even had someone accompany us to our waiting taxi, some 300 meters away at 4a.m.. Thanks to Elena, Valentina and all your wonderful staff for making our stay so perfect.;5
Me and my wife decided to book the Rihad Kheirredine as a birthday treat. From the moment you set foot in this beautiful, boutique hotel you are hit by the stunning dÃ©cor and open air courtyard . We stayed in the Musk room, which was beautiful and the service was absolutely faultless. I cannot over emphasise just how wonderfully charming and charismatic the team are, always on hand to help in any way they can. A real gem of a find and the people make it all the more enchanting! We will be back for sure...;5
Spent 1 night at Ameritania and was greeted by Julian, the bellman! He greeted us with a smile and was extremely helpful immediately! He stored our bags for us since the room was not immediately ready and began to give us directions to nearby locations. Our room was very modern and clean and the entire staff was pleasant and welcoming!!! Front desk staff were all very accommodating! Would definitely return, hope to see Julian again!!! Heâs truly a great sincere man!! AAAAA++++++++!;5
This historic hotel is a perfect lovely place to stay if youâre doing business at the Javits Center-only a two block walk. The diner on the first floor isnât quick and delicious for a quick bite before you head out to your meetings.;5
We stayed here for 4 nights in February and it was a great hotel! The staff were all really friendly, the hotel was always really clean and our room was always lovely and clean.  The room was basic but everything we needed and the bathroom was nice the shower had good pressure.  When we come back to New York we will definitely stay again but ask for a room with a view. Our room you could just see another wall of the hotel from the window. Didnât ruin the holiday or anything though we didnât spend much time in the room.  All in all a great stay! The location is amazing so close to Times Square and the Empire State;5
We had the most wonderfull time of this year! I requested an upgrade when available, but there was no option. We had a fine room (2835), but the staff did their utmost to upgrade the last night of our stay to a Terras Suite with balcony (2623). Awesome! Weâll be back one day, thatâs a promise. And weâll be staying at yours, thatâs a fact. Special thanks to Mohammed, Samira and Driss for our upgrade on the last night.;5
Room was cozy enough, but I wouldâve liked better pillows and bed but they werenât that bad, Iâm just used to my luxurious mattress. Good location and conveniente short walk to subways. Pretty looking hotel. The best was the overall service: EXCELLENT!;5
We stayed at the Hilton as we only had 2 days in LA and we wanted to visit Universal Studios. The hotel is literally a 10 minute walk to Universal. We took a car to Santa Monica pier also and this was only about 30 minutes away..on a Saturday morning mind you.  Lovely hotel, great restaurant and lobby bar with lots of food options. Would highly recommend if you have limited time and are going to universal studios.;5
Stayed here with the family for a Universal Studios visit.  The hotel is nicely appointed, clean and comfortable.  The rooms are large, and I really like the ability to go online before your check-in to see the room you are assigned and pick a new one from available units.  The staff are super professional, courteous and friendly.  Room service provided good food and quick, efficient service.  The CafÃ© restaurant in the lobby has great buffets available during the week.  The only complaint is the elevators, as others have pointed out, but the hotel is working to correct this.  They even assigned staff to control the elevators during a busy morning during our stay to take the elevator directly to the lobby once it was full, avoiding elevators stopping at each floor on the way;5
Made our stay in New York! Location was excellent, directly outside Madison square garden and a 5 minute walk to Macy's/5th Avenue.View from our room was the Empire state! Tube station close by. Easy to get both uptown/downtown Manhattan.  Staff very friendly, needed help/directions getting to our Yankee game in which they were more than happy to help with.  Diner below served lovely and reasonably priced meals, great for a quick bite before you head.   Would 100% recommend this hotel, suitable for all ages.;5
It was great we went to visit the sites in Los Angeles great location and great service. My family and I enjoyed our time with great customer service. I love Los Angeles. Such a great city. We were able to walk around and enjoy he city sites;5
This hotel is in a great location right across from Lincoln Center. Check in was easy. Nick at front desk was very friendly and helpful.  Hotel lobby and the hotel bar are very attractive - looks like the hotel has just been renovated. There is even a night club like rooftop bar to check out. The room was clean, big, and quiet. The bed was comfortable. The front desk even charged our cellphones when we returned a couple hours after checking out. I was impressed. The Empire Hotel exceeded my expectations.;5
Walking distance to the theaters, close to Penn station and subway.   Room was a nice size for a NYC hotel.  I've stayed at more expensive and gotten much less.  Street was full of tourists and some homeless, so if you're looking for something quieter, this may not be for you, but we enjoyed our stay.;5
Arrived early and got a room right away. Bell boy took me to my room which was very compact but plenty of space for one person. Place for your case under bed and above. A few hooks over the long mirror which runs along one wall. Fan in room and aircon  (which was very noisy). Water, lots of towels, dressing gown and slippers provided (Great!) Bathrooms very clean (I saw the cleaner in there at least once an hour). Fabulous roof bar with outside area with the most amazing view over the Hudson to NJ skyline. (Expensive bar!)  8 mins walk to nearest subway (14th st/8th Ave)  Literally one minute to the High Line. Lots of local eateries and the Whitney Museum.    Loved it. Can't wait to come back.   Amazing for the price!;5
The New Yorker just keeps getting better.  New Vault Steakhouse in the basement gives a nice option and has great food.  Of course the Tick Tock is perfect after a late night in the city.  Guest services is great from top to bottom.;5
Tucked away is a lovely welcoming Riad. From the moment you are collected to the moment you leave you feel valued. The room was long and thin but beautifully decorated and very calming. The service was impeccable. The girls on reception were always on hand to find out how your day was and the restaurant service (Bryham??) was fantastic. We ate the Moroccan meal there the 1st night - do NOT miss it - it was delicious and the chef was lovely telling us recipes at the end (they even bought in a cake with a sparkler on for my birthday at the end ). The roof terrace is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle. Nothing as too much for the RK, and if ever we found ourselves back in Morocco, this would be our place of choice to stay.;5
Room was very comfortable but the bathroom was a bit on the small side for two people.  Locations was great.  Staff were very friendly.  Were eager to help out with any questions. Would recommend the hotel to any of my friends that are thinking of visiting NY;5
The room was clean and the staff was super kind. Pil was our front desk guy who took care of every question even tourist spots or any good restaurants/clubs. I would definitely stay again... Plus the cleaning crew is super sanitary;5
The New Yorker Hotel, opposite from Penn Station, is close to transportation, and a very friendly, fashionable place to park your luggage and get out in Manhattan. The room was roomy, the view was fantastic (Empire State Bldg out one window, the New World Trade Center out the other.) Madison Square Garden lit up the night. Macy's, JC Penney, Target and AMC Theatres are within one or two blocks walking distance. So convenient, clean and comfortable.;5
I really enjoyed my stay! I felt very safe and secure here! The staff was friendly and helpful! A great dining experience at Carmine's wonderful italian food which is just a few blocks from hotel.  I took the train to Penn Station and would advise first timers to ask for Train 2 or 3 when they arrive so that they get on correct train to hotel as it is very close. Would definately stay here again!;5
The Rooms were small but clean with all the standard amenities. The staff were all helpfull and we would like to give a special mention for Jeff. we were split up over three floors 4, 6 and 10 and all rooms were much the same. The a/c can be a little noise but it works very well. The showers were always hot and room service was excellant. We would use the hotel again;5
Hotel is located on prime location. Prices are always economical sometime even cheapest if book in adavces. Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Breakfast is full of varieties and worth agaist money value;5
"Excellent service from Samah at night front desk - above and beyond to make me tea at 5am, and when I thanked him with a candy cane, he was so delightful and give me a Christmas ornament I've named ""Sam"" and whi has become my travel buddy this trip.  Javier gave 5 star friendly service in the restaurant.  We had continental breakfast in our package - the omelet and heavier meats is ""full"" breakfast. We upgraded some morning and left it continental for others mornings. 7am opening. 6am is coffee bar which also has food.  We stayed 23rd floor Executive floor with incredible views of city, hills and park. Highly recommend as high up was you can go if you want to watch sunrises or settings.  Wish there was an ""internal"" reward system, lime Southwest has. The size of drink coupons,";5
My wife & I have stayed in many fine hotels.  This visit was made extra special by the Empire Hotel's staff.  I particularly want to single out Carlos, an assistant Hotel Manager, who could not do enough to make our stay wonderful.;5
Hollywood Hotel sure lives up to its name.  You really get a sense of old Hollywood with its architecture. The staff is friendly and they were really helpfull. The room was beautifuly decorated and very clean. There is a cute little shop in the lobby that also became very helpfull.  Considering the price we paid, we really got great value for our visit. We actually came from Norway to attend the Oscars and this is the hotel we choosed.;5
Riad Kheirredine is really something special, different and unique, an experience worth having! It is a place with character, a beautiful oasis in the middle of the magic Medina: a shelter for peace and relax after a busy day in this amazing city. Breakfast on the terrace was absolutely fantastic. But the real added value is the staff! Those people are amazing, they will treat and pamper you like you were their best friend coming to Marrakech visiting them.  Valentina, Yajaira, Daniele, Helena, and everybody else went the extra mile to make us feel better than home, always with a smile and I tell you, sometimes it was not so easy as we were a family group of 15 of which 8  children and teenagers. We will definitely come back! Grazie Infinite!;5
I chose this Riad purely based on the reviews including a recommendation from the Telegraph. I have to say that I was not disappointed at all. From the moment we were picked up from the airport,(Yes, the Riad can arrange airport pickup and drop off at a very reasonable price) we were treated with a lot of consideration and kindness. The staff is very attentive to the needs of the guests and no request is too tasking for them.  The Riad is stunning and the layout is very beautiful.  You really do not need to dine out as the in-house restaurant serves delicious food. Please try out the âtangiaâ. Simply beautiful. One of the highlights of my stay was the Hammam and massage. Very professional and relaxing. Highly recommended ðð¾   Thank you Asma, Elena, Brahim and all the amazing;5
Location cannot be beat. We were equal distant to downtown Los Angeles, hiking and Burbank. Service is excellent and friendly. Looking forward to staying again on my next trip to Universal City once more opens up.;5
The staff at the Hilton Universal City is very attentive and welcoming.  They are very responsive to your every need.  In addition, the quality of the food is exceptional.  It is truly a pleasure to stay at this hotel - which I have done on many occasions.;5
We spent an overnight layover at the Hyatt Regency LAX and found the hotel to be a great option for travelers.  It's conveniently located to the airport with frequent shuttle service, has room service with pretty good food, attentive hotel and dining staff, and clean, modern, comfortable rooms.  We would stay here again on future layovers.  Our discounted AAA rate made the hotel even more appealing.;5
This is a fantastic hotel. Itâs so good that I reactivated my long-dormant TripAdvisor account to write a review. The staff was amazing: super nice, friendly, and helpful. I cannot say enough good things about every person we encountered. The room was great â huge (and this is New York!), comfortable, and most important, clean. Keep in mind this is a 100-year-old building so âcleanâ does not always mean ânew,â but we felt very comfortable. They did a great job, especially given the pandemic. Itâs worth checking out the small museum about the history of the hotel in the basement, or even just the Wikipedia page. Thank you to the fantastic people at The New Yorker. Weâll be back for sure!;5
I was a week in New York and it was all amazing. I think if I come back I would still choose this hotel. I found it comfy near the central park. on foot takes about 20 minutes to Times Square. Kindly staff, especially Pasquale, italian like me, who gave me all the information I needed in my language.;5
Loved this hotel ... very small room but ok for what we needed it for :)  We had a view of Maddison square garden from our room I loved the decor it was lovely .. Tick tock dinner I found was over rated ...   Best thing was we got engaged in this very hotel   We will definitely be back;5
Every time I'm in NYC I have stayed here, aside from my first visit- the place keeps me coming back!  I arrived really early in the morning, checked in with the front desk, and checked my luggage. I have to admit, being a soon to be checked in guest, I was glad not to be charged to check my bags until my room was ready. The clerk at the front desk took my info and credit card (Room was a pre-paid reservation, aside from taxes and incidentals) and told me to come back sometime between 2 and 3:30. I expressed my preference for a room with a city view (as opposed to Hudson River), and she said she would see what she could do.   I came back later that afternoon and had a short wait after checking back in with the front desk. I was assigned room 2535. I have to admit, there were;5
First off, this hotel is in an amazing location. You're in the middle of everything and there is a subway station right around the corner.  Upon arrival, we were informed that we had been upgraded. The room was very clean and very spacious.  The staff were very friendly and always willing to help. We needed to print tickets for the ice hockey whilst visiting and the reception staff were happy to print them, free of charge. The bellhops were very friendly (especially Julian who always had time to have a chat with us). We were always greeted upon arrival, whether by bellhops or the cleaners that we passed in the corridor.  The only very small downside was the free wifi only being available in the lobby (however, I was able to connect to the LinkNYC wifi from the room). I would;5
First visit to LA with my wife and 3 year old daughter. Hotel is in a great location off the highway and easy access to most things you would want. The hotel itself is ok (im comparing it to hilton times sqaure where i am right now) but what gives it 5 stars is the fantastic staff from front desk to housekeeping. Thank you very much for a pleasant stay.;5
We had a disasterous trip getting to New York because of cancellations, delays and then lost luggage on top of it. We arrived at the hotel around 1pm knowing that check in time wasnt until 4. We just wanted somewhere to put our shopping bags (full of clothes we had to buy since we were missing our luggage). Mohammed offered to check us in early which literally made our day because we needed to rest a bit. It was like the only part of our trip that went well, so it made a big difference. People complain about the smallness of the rooms but I thought it was cute and it gave it a little New York twist. We visted the Tick Tock diner next door for dinner and ended up staying until midnight drinking wine :) All we had to do after that was walk up to our room and go to sleep! Thank you!;5
All the previous 5 star reviews sum up this Riad. We booked as a result of this hotel being No 1 on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. We were collected from the airport as promised and taken to a square near the riad, and immediately immersed in Medina life which can be slightly intimidating. We were then taken on foot a few hundred metres to the riad and on arriving were impressed by the welcome, professionalism,friendly staff, and our immaculate rooms.  Being nervous of the surrounding lanes we were always provided with a young man to take us to restaurants or the taxi stop if we wanted this. We hired guides for 2 mornings through the riad - worth every penny to see really interesting places in Marrakesh without hassle.   For dinner we loved Cafe Arabe and the nearby;5
Check in for a one night stay for short trip in City.  The front desk was courteous and friendly.  The room was clean and cheerful and I wouldn't hesitate returning as this is my second stay a this little gem;5
The nicest 'riad', beautifully decorated, the sweetest and most caring and competent crew, wonderful food and wine, lovely airconditioned rooms/small apartments, nice and cooling swimmingpool and a beautiful view of the city and the mountains from the roof terrace... We spent 4 days/nights and had a wonderful stay. Marrakech was fabulous, Riad Kherredine was stunning!;5
This hotel and especially the service with the receptionist Mr. Pill was exceptional. If you had any other choices, the hospitality expressed by Mr.Pill was so welcoming, you wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. Thanks for a great stay at Hollywood Hotel.;5
I went down to LA for a quick overnight and booked my hotel last minute.  Unfortunately I booked the wrong night but the front desk staff was gracious and allowed me to transfer my no-show fee to my room charge.  Great location and great stay.  I usually avoid airport hotels but I would stay here again!;5
Let me just start by saying that the Empire Hotel is one of my favorite hotels in New York City. Not only is it in one of the move amazing and convenient locations (Lincoln Center), but it also has one of the most professional and friendliest staffs I've ever encountered. As a present to my sister and niece over Thanksgiving I decided to book them a week at The Empire. The suite they got was phenomenal, the service exceptional, and they literally had the best visit to New York they've ever had largely in part to their stay there. I also need to give a special shout out to Aaron Collins, the head of food and beverage there.  He was so extremely giving and gracious to my family I can't thank him enough.  The champaign was constantly flowing, the chocolate covered strawberries were;5
My 2 good friends and I just stayed for 2 nights and are still talking about the stay.  Yes, it's a bit outside the main square but adds ambiance and local feel.  The rooms were spectacular and all had their own character.  Amenities were lovely and even a hair dryer!  From our entrance to our exit we were treated like family and friends.  Breakfast was fresh fruit and yogurt, lovely breads and jams, eggs any way we wanted, fresh orange juice and coffee and this Italian cheese we LOVED!  Fruit, water and sweets were always in the rooms, our clothes hung up and bed freshened.  Abdou was there to take us to and from any location and Valentina was a real gem.  Honestly, every single person in the Riad was simply stunning.  We hated to leave and gave big hugs on the way out.  We all;5
I stayed in this hotel from 6 to 9 July 2006.  This was the best hotel of my entire month-long stay in the United States.  The staff were very professional and friendly.  My room was lovely - it was spacious,  had a very large bathroom with shower and tub, and a lovely view on the Hollywood Hills.  The basket with fruit, biscuits and water was appreciated.  I took some tours of LA with Starline Tours and was collected and dropped off at my hotel. I can recommend Starline's tours.;5
After a long drive Tired and ready to relax the front desk (Josna) made it all worth it. She was very friendly and really understood all my needs. Once in the room it was perfect. Great start to a vert busy trip. Josna youâre the best.;5
from the moment you pull land you will feel nothing but appreciated and hosted. The ambience and the people at this hotel really know how to make your stay comfortable and pleasant. Take advantage of the experience and especially the comfortable bed and pillows .;5
At the risk of sounding redundant, Riad Kheirredine is an incredible experience. I was met at the airport, escorted through the cobbled streets of the medina to a door down a small alley which opened into such fabulousness! The property is as it appears on their website, no surprises there. It was clean, well kept and the staff were so friendly, helpful and accommodating. One night coming in from dinner in the new city, we were met by a staff member with umbrellas for me and my friends. We're still puzzled as to how they knew we were on our way because we hadn't called them! That level of attention is rare in the hospitality industry and helped make the visit to Marrakech all the more memorable. Thanks to the whole team!;5
I stayed 2 nights for business and the staff was so friendly. Emily and Javier and the entire staff were very welcoming. My room was very clean and the shower was great! I will be back on my next trip to nyc!;5
I was only there so I dI'd not need to travel back to Eastern Long Island late at night and then return early morning. The room was small, but good price and I slept well. The staff was friendly and the front desk even gave me a drink coupon after being stuck in the check in line behind several buses of college students needing to check in. The staff was accommodating and friendly and helped make quick stay very nice.;5
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had a beautiful corner suite overlooking Lincoln Center. The staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the rooftop bar and there were several other eating options within a block.;5
Great location for tourist visit, subway very handy (much cheaper and quicker than a cab and easy to use !!) and very helpful staff on front desk and the door staff !! Rooms good size for NYC......you are never in the rooms other than to sleep.;5
I researched over forty Riads in Marrakesh, narrowed it down to five and emailed them all with our requirements. Riad Kheirredine was one of only three that replied, and the only one that did so within an hour. Flurries of emails to and fro later and I was convinced this was definitely the place for us. They arranged a mountain tour through Berber villages in the Atlas Mountains, a guided tour of the souk and booked us in at the in house hammam. Their welcome face to face was exceptional. Nothing was too much to ask. Everyone was very welcoming and smiling. The food is excellent, my only complaint was the desserts are all very sweet and were too sickly for me, but that is the Moroccan style. The hammam was wonderfully relaxing and we loved the amazing scenery in the mountains.;5
We had three nights in a Db. Room En-suite  on 5th floor. Fabulous views over River Hudson ,New Jersey, Statue of Liberty.A lovely quirky hotel with many original features & history in a great location We did not realize and were not informed there was a roof bar and sitting room maybe because it seemed to be booked up by private parties /weddings the three days we were there.And we did not know the cafe was going to be closed for renovations. Apart from these two points I loved our stay here at the end of a 3 week trip around the East coast of USA and would definitely stay here again.;5
Beautiful hotel, which has been remodeled. It reminded me of a trip to another era. The decor is Art Deco, which is very retro. It's close to Lincoln Center, Fordham University, & Columbus Circle. The rooms are clean & comfortable with all the usual amenities. Although the traffic noise is fairly intense, it's to be expected in Manhattan, & part of the NY experience.;5
Close to Central Park and a 20 min walk to Broadway ð­ and Times Square. Friendly helpful staff. Room was a little on the small side but big enough for what we needed. Bed was huge. The only complaint I would have was the extortionate prices in the bar. I expect to pay a little more for the convienence of drinking in the hotel but prices nearly  double in bars on Times Square. The Mini bar too was expensive. Other than that a great hotel perhaps ready for a love and tender care in a few areas but overall for the price, location and what you get - you can't go wrong. We will definitely book again here for our next trip to NYC.;5
Stayed in room 2109 October 21-23. What a great experience in this beautiful and historic art deco building. The staff was professional, security at the door and elevator was on point. The room was very retro classy with an extremely comfortable bed and bedding. Yes, the the bathroom is small but stylish and has everything needed. This room boasted 3 windows looking toward the Hudson.. Great views. Coffee bar and pastries every morning was great at the lobby location and it was fun to see and listen to travelers from other countries enjoy as well. The location is perfect for bus, subway, times square, Macy's, Madison Square Garden etc. Truly a NYC experience all around.;5
First time in NYC. This hotel is not upgraded or fancy in anyway and thatâs okay. It was built in the 1920âs and itâs a grand old lady. Parking is down the street for $50 a day with no in and our privileges (but you shouldnât need your car if you walk or take the metro everywhere). Staff was friendly. Rooms look like they would have back when people lived here in the 1920âs. We reserved a standard room but was upgraded to the family suite. It was very nice. The beds were soft and bedding was clean. The bathtub was an old claw foot tub which made it very classic. To go to the elevators you must show your room key to the attendant who is watching the elevators. The first 19 floors are a student hostel which is very cool. Itâs a great way for them to attend school and live off;5
We loved the Empire Hotel - beautiful rooms and a really fun part of town. And Tommy the doorman made the visit! We will most certainly be back again. Thank you for hiring such wonderful staff, it truly makes the experience better.;5
Just 10 minutes walk from Universal Studios, so we could arrive the Park early to avoid the later long queues. City Walk offers restaurants of a wide price range, but no supermarket. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds. It was spacious, clean and the view overlooking the Studios is superb. The staff are all very nice. Our children like Tim the doorman in particular as he is very funny and kids-friendly. The elevators are slow sometimes, but are tolerable, and there are staff assisting us.;5
Perfectly situated in midtown New York , friendly staff , comfortable accommodation, handy on site cafe style restaurant and regular Restaurant . The Hotel was refurbished to a good standard and had a wonderful history ! The security as we went to the lifts to access out room was comforting .;5
"Where do I start ? Maybe by saying a few big chain luxury hotels need to take a leaf out of this riad âs books to know how itâs done properly. Riad Kheirredine is tastefully decorated with beautiful rooms and comfortable beds. Little touches here and there make all the difference; fresh fruit  dotted around the seating areas and rooms , refreshing mint tea and pastries on request and attentive staff seeing to every need. Special  mention goes to .Eleanor, Adjane, Sihane, Ibrahim, Yassine and chef Hossaine who made the most delicious food. Definitely dine in if you can as food is exceptional, breakfasts are very generous as well. Part of me would love to guard this place jealously and not tell anyone. The other part of me wants to shout out from the rooftops .There is a reason";5
We booked this hotel online last minute based on online reviews and the photos on their website, having noticed the only real complaint was the size of the room. We were pleasantly surprised that the hotel indeed had the boutique feel, with fun furniture and styling. And really wasn't even that small considering we're in NYC, mere blocks from Times Square, and on the same block as the theater the Late Show with Stephen Colbert is filmed at. Would have stayed longer if we had more time.;5
We got a great room on the 11th floor with an awesome view and the hotel itself is in an amazing location. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Bathroom is small but the quality of the room overall was awesome!;5
Always find Hilton hotels to provide excellent quality and services. When ever we travel we always look for a Hilton property near our destination.  The Universal Hilton has by far the best location for travellers planning to visit Universal Studios Hollywood. Although it is within short walking distance, there is a free shuttle service to the theme park.;5
Our favourite hotel we have ever stayed. Incredible magical experience from start to finish! Staff were so lovely and really care for you, a special mention to Yassine Ibriham and Iliyas (apologies if Iâve spelt incorrectly!) who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was unforgettable. The hotel is spotlessly clean, and the interior is just so pretty. It is in a perfect location for getting around and the reception ladies even give you a spare phone to use in case you get lost so you always feel safe and comfortable when you are out and about. Canât fault a thing! Thank you so much we canât wait to be back. PS: please donât do the horse carriage rides or the camel rides in the city! The animals are overworked underfed and exhausted.;5
my stay was fun   love the hotel staff very friendly   and check in is very fast     the rooms can be a little bigger but but they still nice and very updated    will stay again;5
Great customer service , pil made our stay great! The room was big and comfortable. The pool is open which was a plus since most places are closed. Thank you for not letting us sleep in our car, highly recommended;5
Just want to give a shout out to Tommy the doorman for your hotel he want above and beyond the call of duty to help me with my family when I stay at your hotel.to bad your pool was closed the bar was terrific your security was no where to be found why was that but my stay at your hotel was great;5
The Empire isn't flashy and new, it is comfortable and established. The location is fantastic for myself and my family , visiting from Canada to spend time with our daughter., and her family.  It is a short walk to Central Park, Lincoln Center, and a 15 minute walk to a Broadway show. I love it!!;5
Stayed one night to catch next mid day flight from lax.  Valet is smooth and efficient ($48) vs $40 self parking.  Check in quick and courteous even though I came in earlier than 3pm check in time, room on 9th floor overlooking airport runways which is really enjoyable, super clean room hallways and public areas , very nice cafe / Resturant on site , reasonable pricing.  Great vibe hotel following all COVID19 protocols.  Welcome a stay again anytime.;5
We had planned a family get-together (4 grandchildren and six parents) in order to see Universal Studios.  The hotel was near-by and seemed, on paper, to be in a perfect location. The location was perfect with only a short walk to Harry Potter et al, but the hotel was even more perfect.  The staff were always friendly and helpful.  The rooms were large and comfortable.  We had breakfast at the hotel, who were never overwhelmed by family with multiple grandchildren bouncing up and down.    The concierge was incredibly helpful.  Our visit coincided with the 'heaviest rain' ever in Southern CA so were anxious about getting tickets.  But the concierge, Samantha, gave us good advice: start early, enjoy the indoor rides and shows and crowds might be less because of the weather;5
"I got this hotel for family visiting NYC for the first time. Overall, I am very pleased with this hotel. They allowed my guests to check in earlier (because they are seniors, it made a huge deal for them being able to lay down after a long flight), the price was amazing ( especially for an August weekend stay); the room had an awesome view ( I actually think they upgraded my family without even mentioning it), and the staff was very nice and professional.   I was very impressed with Empire Hotel, I leave nearby and I will be recommending this place to all my guests and friends.   Tip: try requesting room 919. The view was the best.";5
A standout was Roxanne at the front desk. She took excellent care of our family. We asked to change rooms shortly after check-in due to a guest next door and their small dog. Roxanne was able to get us a new room, same view, and also provide additional bedding and blankets for the sofa bed. We interacted with her several times during our stay and she was always very pleasant, professional, helpful and prompt in dealing with our requests. Lucas was also very courteous and helpful in his service of subsequent requests for bedding. Around 1 AM the first night, after moving to our new room, we had to call the front desk because our new guests next door. They must have attended one of the many Christmas parties being hosted at the Hilton and were laughing and carrying on without;5
Our organization planned a large meeting in New York, and worked with the Empire Hotel to serve as the official hotel for conference delegates. We have worked with them the last two years, and they are a great company to work with, they offer excellent support, and make managing such a large room block effortless.   The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, in the middle of all the action, with beautiful rooms, great amenities, a tasty restaurant connected (Ed's Chowder House), and a lobby bar that any guest would enjoy. We look forward to continue working with the Empire Hotel, as our conference delegates absolutely enjoyed their stay! I highly recommend considering this location for your next stay, whether it be a family vacation, a business trip, or for a large group.;5
A great stay with a girlfriend and I - super spacious room. Excellent breakfast. Hot tea & coffee facilities in our room. Ali the front desk man was always unfailingly helpful with our many varied requests. He set up Netflix for us to cast from our devices - a saving on paying for movies etc. Our late check out was accepted. We had printing done free of charge. And plenty of advice re what to see etc. The pool is excellent and all day sun or shade. We also walked down Sunset Blvd into West Hollywood - or caught a lyft further west to excellent restaurants and cafes. Highly recommend staying here - comfortable and good value;5
We booked on the riad following the good  reviews. We made the right call. Everything said is 100% reliable. The mobile they provided you with the maps, the breakfast, the food, the bar at the roof terrace, the cleaning service, the boys who sort you from and to the Medina, the fruit and the tea across the riad, the concierge service and what is the most important, the kindness of the whole staff. Thank you very much Road Kheirredine. We made we really enjoyed our trip to Marrakesh.;5
I enjoyed checking in, and the customer service was fantastic. Parking was  also gated and vey very spacious, definitely a major plus for me. Mylka was also a great host ð  Definitely would come again.;5
Pil at the front desk was super nice, curtious, and helped me with all my questions about the surrounding area. My room was even nicer than the pictures online presented, nice and clean. Great atmosphere, would stay again!;5
It is nice to come to a boutique hotel where the compliments are deserved. And Sophy, at the front desk makes you feel welcome. She makes you feel like you are a long time guest. Ask for her. You'll see what I mean. The room is great.;5
stayed here when we went to a conert at MSG. clean, beautiful exceptional service! tick tock diner attached to hotel. great stay will definately go back.if you stay in NYC stay here, you wont be dissapointed;5
They have a full kitchen for breakfast which was amazing! That's all I wanted to say but I guess I need a minimum of 200 letters to submit this review so I'm going to extend this sentence up until the;5
Very clean hotel. Nice for travel connections. Shuttle ruins continuously. Shettle driver very helpful. Very quich check in. Check out. Maybe could better organize grab and go food items. Menus hard to find but overall a very pleasant stay;5
We caught a train at Baltimore airport and went straight through to Penn Station NYC. Walked out into a sunny New York afternoon crossed the street and walked in to the New Yorker. Old World charm at it's best. Greeted immediately by friendly staff, easy check in and straight up to our room. Lovely view over the city with Empire State and Madison Square Garden just outside the window. Perfect place to stay while in NYC with subway right below as well as Tic Toc diner for great meals and friendly staff. Easy to walk to attractions and Times Square. A special thank you to the lovely lady who cleaned rooms on our floor. She always greeted us every morning with a smile and a chat. Asked us what we were doing each day and was just lovely. I would recommend the New Yorker anytime and;5
You can walk from LAX to this hotel. Which scared me with the sound of planes taking off. Surprisingly, you hear none of that. The hotel is offers everything. and if you are lucky enough to get club access, your host Cairo, makes you feel like you're visiting his home. Pretty much nothing he won't do to make sure you have what you want.;5
This was a block away from Penn Station and MSG - people were friendly, helpful and the accommodations were clean throughout.;5
What a classic piece of American history! The staff and service were 100% beyond any NYC hotel I have ever stayed at, especially the help I received from Lilia at the front desk who did triple duty for me when the bellman and porter were unavailable.   I travel everywhere for business and the service here is on par with every 5-star hotel I have ever stayed at!   When you check in ask for the newly renovated rooms!   Safe travels!;5
My daughters and I  spent last weekend in NYC to see 'Lucia di Lammermoor' at the Met. We stayed at the Empire and were delighted with its accommodations, proximity to the Met, and affordability. The Empire will now be our preference when visiting NYC for Lincoln Center performances.;5
We visit NYC  about three times a year and this is quickly becoming one of my favorite hotels. I pop between this and the Viceroy but Ameritania always has a deal! The hotel staff are always helpful and welcome you. The lobby is chic with a little bar where you can grab a drink. The rooms are modern and again chic. I love that they give you four pillows! Maybe that's my favorite part. There are great places to grab food or hear music such as 54 Below. Victors is just down a few streets.  Patsys is close by and MaisonKayser is up a few blocks on Columbus Circle for lattes and a croissant or eggs in the morning. Yes you can walk to all the shows and restaurants in Hells Kitchen.  Make sure you check out Orso on 42nd. It's one of my favorite Italian restaurants along with Matthew;5
The staff was very friendly.  The check in process was efficient.   The only complaint relates to the fact that there should be a safer walkway form the hotel lobby to the bridge to Universal studios.  The room was large with a nice view.  The restaurant was pricey, but the food was very good.;5
Ideal Location for Universal Studios, Universal City, Hollywood, LA...Walked everywhere...The rooms were good sized for large family, clean, extra everything provided, including attention.  Friendly service, clean.  Good food downstairs and great food nearby;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for a week in March, very very impressed, location is fantastic, a short walk to Macyâs, Times Square, madison square garden, penn station to name but a few.  Staff were always very friendly and I liked the fact there was security guards on the lifts so you literally couldnât gain access without a key card, also the room was cleaned to a high standard every morning without fail. The check in was really quick and easy to do, and a $300 hold on my debit card for incidentals. I booked with virgin so all my fees were included such as internet and resort fees, the Wi-Fi was reliable and easy to set up, also had access to the fitness centre if needed. We upgraded to a metro view room for $30 per night and paid $30 for a fridge in the room which was perfect for;5
I am so glad we chose this hotel for our trip to NYC. My friend and I stayed at The Jane in August of 2018. We had a bunk bed room on the fourth floor with a shared bathroom. The room is small, of course, but it was clean (no bugs of any kind) and comfortable. The shared bathrooms were always perfectly clean as well and we didnât have any problems with them being too crowded. The staff is polite and very helpful. The entire hotel looks like itâs straight out of the early 1900âs, in a very cute way. The bar on the top floor is so nice and the view of the Hudson River and the skyline from the rooftop is fantastic. We never checked out the club on the bottom floor. Additionally, the area the hotel is located in is perfect. Itâs pretty centrally located, so it didnât take us more;5
The Jane is in a quiet little area of the West Village in walking distance of many great parks (Washington Square, Union Square, etc.) and close to a subway stop that can connect you with all of the city.  I spent days wandering and walking nearby, then taking the subway to landmarks all over the city.  The hotel has a beautiful art deco lobby with super helpful porters and desk staff.  The room was small but cozy and had all that I needed.  The room and bathroom were scrupulously clean and I loved the extras of a robe, slippers, and bottled water.  The internet was quick and accessible from my room which would have been a deal-breaker.;5
We love this hotel.  Great location.  Close to Hollywood, Universal City Walk and Universal Park, LAX and Beverly Hills area.  Staff is great.  Breakfast bunch is pricey but is excellent!  Something about the beds at this Hilton...I sleep so comfortably.  Have been here several times over the last several years.;5
The absolute best hotel in NYC. The location is the best, near a lot of major attractions. We took the subway just twice in 10 days, to go visit the Brooklyn area. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The room was beautiful, very clean and comfortable. If you stay in a room with a view to the city, you might hear some noises at night, but it wasnât a problem for us. I loved it.;5
Coming into the City for a night or weekend? Can't beat its location right across from Lincoln Center. Right in the heart of Manhattan's west side. Comfortable cozy rooms, immaculately-kept. Attentive staff. Sophisticated setting albeit family (that includes pets!)-friendly.;5
Had an excellent stay at Empire! What nice space boutique like W but in warm tones, comfy bed, location, atmosphere (lounge was awesome). They had the top deck closed would of loved to go up there! It was 60 in December, in NYC??? Definitely, will stay again!;5
My wife and I have just got back to the UK after a four night stay at Riad Kheirredine and really struggling to come to terms with not living at the Riad anymore.   There are literally hundreds of 5 star reviews here on Trip Advisor and Google that wax lyrical about how good this place is but if you're anything like me you still spend ages lingering over tiny details so I'll make it easy and list 10 reasons why this is the best Riad/Hotel/Speciality Lodging(?!) in Marrakech, if not the world.   1.	The Staff. First and foremost we have to mention the incomparable Asma, Sara, and Elena as they will likely be the people you communicate with before your stay and they will be the first and last people you meet when checking in and out. These three wonderful ladies will go far above;5
"The lobby at Empire Hotel is super chic and beautiful!!  The ceiling is tall and the furniture is sophisticated, elegant and has an international feel to it.  The best part of staying at the Empire Hotel is the staff.  A front desk staff named Pasquale is so thoughtful and genuine; he made a difference in my experience at the hotel.  Thank you, Pasquale!!";5
Very comfortable, with beautiful landscaping.  The pool area is beautifully landscaped and the large deck off the kitchen is perfect for relaxing and outdoor dining. This property was like vacationing in a deluxe resort.;5
We stayed at this Riad for a week and used it as our base to discover Marrakech. What a great choice that was. Located in the madness, hustle and bustle of Marrakech, this Riad is an oasis of calm and luxury with its gorgeous courtyards, comfortable suites and gorgeous food. The staff are absolutely exceptional and we cannot compliment them enough! They helped us get find our feet in Marrakech with a guided walk close to the main square (Jemaa El Fna) and provided us with a mobile phone if we were to get lost of needed any help. This Riad exceeded all expectations!;5
Great hotel and great staff. Especially Tommy. From the beginning of my stay with helping me with my luggage to  hailing my cab during checkout, Tommy was there to help me with anything I needed. Thank you Empire.;5
Our first trip to Morocco and we started at Riad Kheirredine.  It was absolutely the right decision!  The hotel provided clear instructions for where to take the taxi to the meeting point where they escort your luggage and you to the Riad for the first time.  Marrakech was a bit overwhelming on first impression, which we totally expected.  Once we walked into the Riad, it was a complete oasis.  At check-in: you get a pot of mint tea (get used to overindulging throughout your time in Morocco) and a staff member spends some time getting you acquainted with the hotel by walking you around.  After you get settled, they spend time getting you ready for what to expect in the medina.  They provide tips on best routes through the medina, safety, etc.  Someone from the Riad is always;5
"Arriving at the hotel the Portier Jeff  made sure we have a great start in our vacation. He was one of the best employees Iâve ever seen. He gave us a lot of recommendations and made us smile every day. A nice young guy at the front office helped us finding some places in the city, especially how to get to the Yankees stadium and when to be there. The hotel has a great location. The room was clean and had a huge bathroom. There where earplugs next to the bed, as you are in the city that never sleeps;) Also there are enough cosmetic products. WiFi worked perfectly in the room and the whole hotel! It was my 5th stay in New York and the next time I will stay again in Ameritania!";5
Excellent place to stay. great value, nice rooms, great service. Very very friendly staff. Centrally located. Right across the street from Lincoln center. taxis and subways right there. Staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and helped us navigate our way around the city.;5
I really don't know what people's problem is with this hotel, I really don't!! I arrived at the New Yorker on the 11th January 2016 and it was nothing but very positive as soon as I stepped through the doors.  For a busy hotel, I received a very smooth check in with Aniana! She was the most pleasant person that knows that a joke and a smile goes a long way with a customer!!   I was expecting a room on a low floor that didn't have that much of a view, but when I got to the room, I had the opposite - I had a room with a view of the Husdon River! I was in room 2081 and it was spotless! The room was far bigger than I thought it was going to be, as NYC is known for rooms that are a bit on the small side, but this room exceeded my expectations and more!   I have to give a big shout;5
Amazing place to stay ! Everyone is so friendly and nice here! We got to park our car valet because it didnât fit in the parking garage. They showed us all around the hotel and how to get to universal studios! This is a great place to stay!;5
I checked in to the Hollywood Hotel and the nice gentleman at the front desk, Gustavo was super hello. He made the check in process very easy and quick. He also provided very useful information about the area and was willing to answer any questions. I would definitely book again.;5
Where do I even begin! Phenomenal! We were given an earlier check in to our rooms due to arriving earlier than expected, with this holiday being a present for my 21st as a first timer in New York City. I was upgraded to a room with a room of the Empire State Building from the 27th floor and must I say what a spectacular view! Many thanks to Mohammed on Reception for doing this for us. Such a truly beautiful hotel. Each member of staff gives you excellent customer service and nothing ever seems to much for them. They truly go the extra mile.  Rooms are plenty big enough, beds are shockingly comfortable knowing previous hotel stays with lovely firm pillows to rest your head after a long day. Tick Tock being the 24/7 dinner downstairs within The New Yorker provides tasty  meals 24;5
Very impressive is the Hollywood hotel. Breakfast is super good. Uber pick up is in the door of hotel so we feel safe. Mr.  Pil check us in early for only $50 U.S and we got to come in early to the room so my children sleep. Iâm so happy and will rerun. Thank you so much for having us.;5
My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in the second week of November 2014.  This place was beautiful, the room we had was quaint and in a very nice way, comfortable, clean and well appointed. I believe it was called the Rose room.   The one main reason we highly - HIGHLY - recommend this place is because of its service! They truly set the standard for good service, extremely polite, tremendously helpful, knowledgeable and absolutely sincere in their efforts.  We are supremely grateful for the exceptional hospitality and how that team made out stay so pleasurable.    Unfortunately I am horrible with names and can't recall any right now except that of Valentina's. Wishing them all the success in the future. You guys are doing great on tripadvisor and that is truly credit to your;5
Hotel was very clean and staff were friendly. Great location central in the city and not to far from most things. The only negative (which is the case in most NYC hotels) is the 3pm check in but you can leave luggage at the hotel prior to this time;5
If you really want to go,to Marrakech, then this must be the place. The Riad is wonderful. This Riad  clearly prides its self on customer service and it does not disappoint. The staff have permanent smiles and really care if you are enjoying your stay. We stayed for three nights for a romantic break away and stayed in the valliere room. It was beautiful. You must have a meal at the riad. We had one the first night ( arriving at 2100) and it was the best food we tried in Marrakech. The owner gives you a mobile phone when you arrive and you call them to walk you back to the hotel at night. Brilliant. The breakfast is huge and wonderful. Again, I have to underline the service in this riad. It is the highest  level we have ever experienced in a hotel bar none. Nothing is too much;5
A beautiful Riad in the MÃ©dina. Service is outstanding. A truly high-class hotel with the authentic Marrakech experience within the walls of the MÃ©dina. Staff was extremely accommodating, fluent in multiple languages, and provided local mobile phones to assist guests at a moments notice anywhere you may be in Marrakech from the moment you arrive up to your departure at the airport. Highly recommended hotel for business or personal travelers.;5
Had a very pleasant experience the hotel had a lot to offer and it was nice a close to everything. Very friendly staff particularly Nicole and Beatriz who made me feel at home and made my experience extra special.;5
Love the Empire Hotel! Friendly staff! The lady at the front desk gave me a room with a view. The room was clean and big for a NY hotel! Near a lot to do within walking distances! Loved the rooftop bar and pool! Will be back!;5
I have just returned from the days inn hotel today staying in room 716!!!, and having read the reviews before hand i was expecting the worst and prepared myself.... All i have to say is the people who have written the reviews about dirt infestion have wild imaginations, I encountered nothing but clean and friendly service. My linen was changed twce in my 4 nyt stay and we had fresh towels everyday. Everything in the room was clean, The T.V cable channels worked perfectly and the shower was the best i have encountered. The lift was a little rickety but they volunterr the certificate. The location is excellent and the shop (duane reade) on the corner sells everything. Subway is 30 seconds away (96th street) and trains are more than frequent. It was apparent that the hotel is;5
hi just wanna give a shout out to two great employees at this hotel. Rachel & Mohammad . we came in on the red eye  from the west coast Rachel noticed from my i.d it was my birthday and helped us get in off the street early from over night travel . they upgrades our room and gave me a bottle of bubbly for my bday. they were polite and courteous  in a town thats not known for this . kudos and thanks  we had a great time here;5
This was our 1st time in New York and we couldn't have stayed in a better Hotel. The New Yorker is so Central a perfect location ..we were so well looked after by one member of staff in particular, Samira, nothing was a problem to her ..the Tick Tock diner does a great breakfast that sets u up for the day .. a great Hotel cant wait to go back âºâºâº;5
the hotel has the best location in the city  , and the service is  on point and the experience is worthy , the hotel is always busy so better to book  in advance,  I would recommend to   ask for early check in if planning;5
Just back from a fantastic 4 night stay at this hotel. Our first time in New York so was unsure what expect. When we arrived at the hotel we were not disappointed. Staff are excellent and were very polite from the minute we arrived until the minute we left. If you need to know anything at all speak to Jeff. The room was considerably big for four people and after reading previous reviews I hadn't been expecting the room to be as big. It was extremely clean, bathroom was lovely and beds are very comfortable. House keeping was done to a high standard everyday. We had breakfast in the hotel each morning which was basic, but nice. The location is great being on Broadway and only a few blocks away from Times Square and Central Park. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will;5
We stayed here for a week in September 2016. A huge hotel, but as guests we were made to feel individually welcomed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, despite being incredibly busy with lots of extra guests for the 9/11 memorial events.   When we arrived our room was at the rear of the hotel with no view. The next morning at my request they gave us a choice of two new rooms with views of the Hudson and the Empire State Building.  The diner on the ground floor is a great place for breakfast, the pancakes were delicious! The hotel is ideally placed for exploring with most things within walking distance, The High Line, Times Square , Broadway and Madison Square Gardens is just next door!  I could not fault the cleanliness of all the amenities at the hotel and would ( and;5
Our stay was a wonderful experience. Clean, modern, quiet, everything you would want. Be sure to check in with the doorman named Jeffry. He is so knowledgeable and so helpful for us first times in NYC.;5
we have stayed in this hotel for 6 days and we had a great time and enjoyed almost all the facilities offered by the hotel What we enjoyed the most was the pool area and the cafes inside the hotel  and all the latest model cars that arrived every 5 minutes hahahaha;5
Morningside Inn is the perfect hotel if you're planning to visit the city. I have stayed at the hotel many times throughout the years and it has always been a great experience. The hotel is located in a fantastic neighborhood and is less than a five minute walk to the nearest subway. The building staff (the Manager of Morningside, Patrick, and front desk staff) have always been extremely polite and helpful with whatever has been needed. The building and the rooms themselves have always been extremely clean and are very well-kept. The hotel also has a full kitchen on each floor (sink, stove and microwave) which is an added bonus! I would absolutely recommend this hotel to any traveler! Great price, great location, great staff!;5
Excellent place to stay, just across the street from the Lincoln Centre, close to Columbus Circle, within walking distance of Broadway theatres, and a short walk to Central Park.  The Chowder House restaurant is excellent for big meals or just the chowder. All the staff  were thoughtful and gave excellent service.  I will always stay there.;5
I have been staying at this hotel a lot this month and I think it's great.  Josna at the front desk checking me in was extremely efficient, professional and showed genuine care about making my stay excellent.  If you have status and have access to the club lounge you will not be disappointed by the service you receive.  Cairo could teach classes about how to value your customers and make them feel like family.  He really is something special and I hope the hotel knows how lucky they are to have him.  That being said, Derek working in the evening is also excellent and I have to mention Karizza in the morning.  Basically the entire staff at the club lounge will do their best to make your stay fabulous even though the food options are quite repetitive nightly.  (not a problem if;5
We booked with virgin holidays for this hotel and trip and the price you pay includes the resort tax which most people seem to get charged at the end of the hotel stay so we didnât need to pay a resort fee. I contacted virgin holidays before travelling  and if you book this hotel with them you pay no resort tax. So the woman politely on the reception desk (who by the way was the most helpful person and giving us recommendations to go see places and places to eat) said she would lower the charge they hold on to your card whilst you stay to $150 instead of the $350 hold they place on your card because we had nothing more to pay which was great. The hotel is popular there was always people in reception and outside, our cabin crew stayed here as well!   There was only 2 of us and we;5
Omg Amazing, every time we turned a corner we found something else we loved about the property. We loved the tv system, the staff, the breakfast and especially the Staff....Nicole at check in was professional, and really helped make our stay.;5
I love to thank (Nicole) for giving the most positive attitude an employee can give during our stay. I also like to give gratitude to (Brian) a beautiful person who got me through a hard and most intense night of my life by giving me kind and helpful tips in handling my stress that night. Thank you Hollywood Hotel for hiring such good hearted profissional employees. The only suggestion that I would give is that, in the breakfast area, please make sure the take out coffee plastic cups are always stacked and available so that we could enjoy our coffee out side the breakfast area so that there won't be any hassle what so ever. Thanks and I hope my review makes a difference anyway possible.;5
"The New Yorker is an older, wonderful hotel, very centrally located at 34th and 8 Ave. near Chelsea, the HighLine, theaters, some great restaurants, shopping and transportation.  The New Yorker is elegant, friendly-staffed, clean and safe.  We had a small room, but it was totally comfortable from the bed to the lighting and storage.  The bathroom was a little small, but worked fine for us. My wife shared that she felt totally safe and secure in The New Yorker.  We did use the private Business Center for some NYCity map information - the computers and printers worked great. Had no time to use the huge, very well-equipped Health Center.  DID eat in their Tick-Tock, on-site diner for a later evening meal; food was quick and good. We've stayed in a dozen nice NYCity hotels in the";5
The hotel was in a Great location. The room was cleaN and spacious. We had a very easy check-in and checkout.  Great staff. Parking is too expensive. We traveled far and needed a truck. We had to valet it.;5
"My review is very late but we had a fabulous trip and this Hotel was perfect location for Universal Studios and for the train. Yes the lifts were a little out of action at times but you just have to be patient. The gift store has ""Guess"" jewellery and compared to Aust. was a great buy. The lobby had water for guests when passing through with lemons and limes etc. The rooms were comfortable. The buffet breakfast was just fabulous, a range of all sorts. Have the cook make you a crepe with your chosen filling. yogurts, milks, fruits, cereals, hot food. was fabulous and the service was brilliant. Universal Studios and City Walk was so close that we went everyday, a couple of full days and then we start going by train to Staples Center, Sunset Boulevard etc. to get to Santa Monica";5
Pil was great to work with, he had excellent customer service skills and he was very knowledgeable about the area and the hotel. I will definitely recommend coming here, it was nice, clean, and affordable;5
A lovely riad of exceptional service from a team of highly dedicated and genuine staff who strive to please and take care of us, often exceeding our expectations.  Perfect lemonade mint tea, honest advice abt souks, thoughtful gesture to celebrate my husband's birthday.  A 5-star worthy riad in Marrakech, the true oasis in Morocco.  Thank you! =);5
Stayed at this Riad for 3 nights. After walking through a maze of alleys you reach the Riad. As soon as you go inside you are immediately overwhelmed by the decorations and subtle details. The staff are really exceptional and try their best to keep you happy. I also noticed that the staff numbers are quite large for a small Riad which means that always there is someone at hand to help you out in case you need anything. Our room was a bit small but was clean, well decorated and had all we needed. Breakfast and dinner at the hotel were excellent and the hotel had free fruit bowls everywhere which was a very nice gesture. Thank you to the whole team for a wonderful stay in a remarkable city.;5
My husband and I stayed at Hollywood hotel four years ago. We loved our stay, from check in to check out. We have returned agan this year it still is the same excellent stay except parking is a bit expensive.;5
The New Yorker hotel is large and beautiful. The rooms are big and have everything you could need. The best part are the views of NYC, they take your breath away. There are a lot of elevators to use and they are fast. The Housekeepers were pleasant and cleaned the room every day. My favorite hotel in NYC!;5
I enjoyed my stay and the location is awesome. The hotel is located in a centralized are of the city. The rooms are great and the beds sleep well.  I would come back to stay and suggest to family that they should stay as well.;5
I stayed at The Empire Hotel for a weekend with two girlfriends and we had the best time. It was my first time in NYC and I loved it. The hotel was absolutely perfect, the room had a great view and it was clean and spacious and the beds were so comfy. Location was also a plus! All three of us loved the atmosphere inside the hotel and people at the front desk were very helpful and kind. I will definitely book at The Empire again on my next visit to NYC.;5
We had an amazing stay at The New Yorker and would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC. Mohammed on reception went out of his way to make this an extra special trip by helping us upgrade following our engagement. A trip we will never forget!;5
The location is convenient for shopping, nightlife, dining out, sightseeing, and physical activity.  Even though I didn't find what I was looking for at a reasonable price, I didn't have to look far to shop for a belt.  The bar that I frequented in Chelsea was only a short walk.  My Birthday dinner restaurant was essentially across the street.  My morning runs were through the Hudson River Park/Greenway, that included tennis and basketball courts.  Also, my run was past the new World Trade Center.;5
Thanks to Maria and everyone else at Riad Kheirredine, my husband and I had an excellent time coming back from the Merzouga desertto relax in Marrakech. The service is absolutely first class! I arrived with a cold and they immediately went to the pharmacy for me and got me some medicine, which was wonderful. They gave us a cell phone in case we got lost and had someone walk us to certain location points to make sure we knew where we were going. Every afternoon, they would send up some tea (or any other drink you might want) to your room after you've walked around the busy streets of Marrakech. We had dinner on the rooftop our first night, which was delicious, but I recommend they consider getting some heat lamps as it's still quite cold at night in February. The breakfast is;5
May I say that despite some initial hesitation (i.e.mainly concerning pets) I adore your hotel. With Dante park opposite, It is reminiscent of the Dorchester in London.   The staff is friendly, the ambience is positive, all with rare unobscured views.  One has uncluttered breathing room here.   My room is comfortable, sufficiently spacious and very clean. I like it here a lot. Your location is ideal and close to my favorite things such as Joanne Trattoria.   Although I once lived on the upper east side for over four years, my stay at The Empire Hotel has opened my eyes to the upper west side and refreshed my NY experience.   Congratulations on a fine, boutique hotel with a magnificent rooftop.;5
My wife and I spent 4 wonderful nights here. We enjoyed Marrakech but we loved this wonderful Riad. Valentina and her staff could not have been more welcoming and attentive - nothing was too much trouble. The Riad is set amid a maze of narrow streets and on arrival we were provided with a mobile phone to use if we became lost - something that is surprisingly easy to do especially in the Souk. The food in the Riad was good and plentiful but the highlight was definitely breakfast on the roof terrace.;5
I have experienced Riad Kheirredine in January with my girlfriends and we  had unforgettable moments: the pick up from the airport was well organized, we were greeted from one of the girls of the reception who showed us the entire property (they're expanding and we look forward to visit in the near future) and explained us the main services that they offer. Each morning we were pampered by a rich breakfast and one of us was gluten free: the staff couldn't do any better in order to provide my friend the various gluten free options.  We had the opportunity to try the Spa: it was amazing!  Everyone single member of the staff went above and beyond our expectations, we are keeping on recommending the Riad and we will be for sure back!;5
Delightful stay, the attentive staff is from bellman to bartenders we're exceptional.  Yasssin , Julian, Said took care of us throughout our stay with taxi's, baggage and questions.  The lobby bars Gina & Javier are complete delights and provided a fun and relaxed evening. I look forward to my next NYC visit and stay at Ameritania.;5
The customer service from all employees, the breakfast and the room exceeded all of our expectations especially for one located near LAX. Housekeeping was quick to respond when we called for a few things that we had forgotten as well. I will definitely stay here again.;5
Our first trip to New York was everything we expected and more.  The Empire is a great place to stay, Convenient, friendly and comfortable.The staff were great and nothing was too much trouble.  Rooms cleaned daily and fresh towels and L'Occitaine toiletries.  We took our son for his 21st birthday and the highlight was the US Open Tennis.  Such good value for money $81 for a ground pass which included seats on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and access to every other court.  It is an amazing experience and we were buzzing for days (thank you Carlos for taking us) and as an added bonus, two tennis players were staying at the Empire !!!  I will certainly be returning, not only to New York, but to the Empire Hotel.  Thank you everyone.  Special mentions go to Chirs the Consciege, Daniel,;5
The hotel staff were awesome from the front desk, housekeeping and security staff. Room was big for NYC although a little older but very clean and well appointed. Wonderful lobby area with old NYC charm. Met some nice guests waiting on taxi or Uber... Doorman was great. Food at Tick Tock was very good. Room service used the typical NYC delivery service and didn't charge huge room service fee. Price was great even when booking directly through hotel.;5
One of my best trips ! Iâm so sad to be back.. I visited THE monument I wanted to visit, The Brooklyn Bridge! Pass by this bridge which offers us an unforgettable view and memories. Without forgetting the unforgettable Times Square, with its lights and the incredible crowd there was. It was amazing! I really liked, i didn't get tired of it How to pass a trip to New York without going through Central Park? Its acres of grass, the ideal place for family picnics in a peaceful setting.  Who says New York says food! We started with Mac and cheese at Beecher's, an artisan cheese maker who also offers... its little pots of mac and cheese, ready to eat to go! We also discovered the Lobster Roll, it's a lobster-based sandwich served in a hot dog bun, Ed's Lobster Bar in Soho for the best;5
Plain and simple Pil is awesome and the Hollywood Hotel is amazing. Stayed at many hotels but very few provide the service of the Hollywood hotel. Itâs breakfast is unrivaled and customer service is on point. Couldnât be happier with everything the hotel has to offer plus Pil.;5
We visited NY in November from the UK and stayed at this hotel. The location is perfect, rooms very nicely decorated and bathroom a good size and very clean. The bedroom itself wasn't huge but that was fine as we were out early for breakfast and didn't return until late evening as there is just so much to see and do in this fantastic city. The staff are very efficient and helpful, special mention about Jeff, very helpful and informative with really good advice especially as this was our first visit to NY. I would highly recommend this hotel.;5
My wife and I stayed one night at the Hyatt Regency at LAX to rest between flights. The hotel shuttle was quick to arrive both at arrival and departure, and the driver was helpful with luggage. The room was comfortable and room service was quite quick and efficient. We would use the Hyatt Regency at LAX again if we had a similar flight schedule.;5
Great expereience. Wonderful room. Good location at the Airport. We got upgraded to a huge suite which was fantastic! Good service and free shuttle to the Airport. Gym had a wonderful view overlooking the runway and offered a good variety of equipment. Would recommend this Hotel for persons with connecting flights.;5
My wife and I were very impressed with every aspect of the Riad Kheirredine.  I picked it for its rooftop and overall great ratings.  It did not disappoint.  The staff was very personable and helped us with restaurants, directions, being comfortable, etc.    The Riad itself is kept very clean and the rooftop has amazing views. Coming off a week in Europe, we enjoyed the complimentary laundry service.    Our tanjine dinner was spectacular, especially on the roof.  The breakfasts were also great.  We probably had Moroccan tea three times a day.    Marrakech is a very busy city, and we were very happy to come back each day to relax here.  Highly recommend.;5
Our recent trip to this hotel was made special by Mohammed guest service agent.  He was extremely helpful and went over and above to assist us.  Our room was very clean and although some review said lift waiting time could be long we didnât wait more than 5 mins at any time. I would highly recommend this hotel for location, facilities and cleanliness. Would definitely return;5
I stay at the Empire 3 or 4 times a year, and I always enjoy my stay.  The rooms are smallish, but that's pretty common in NYC hotels.  They are clean and nice, the staff is very friendly, and the location is great!;5
Had a great time. Staff was good, location was excellent, room was nice and clean. What else can I ask for? (I was surprised that a coffee cost money but I hear that all hotels these days, charge.)  :(;5
Great stay here in the fall.  Staff was extremely helpful and location was ideal.  Room was nice size and in top condition.  Certainly a hotel I would recommend for both solo travelers and couples/families.;5
"We have stayed five nights in the Riad Kheirredine in January which has given us the most amazing experience. The Riad Kheirredine is a beautiful oasis and paradise in the Medina of Marrakech and every corner is very tastefully decorated. It was a wonderful experience to enjoy our beautiful room and sitting areas in the Riad Kheirredine. But the most impressive thing of this Riad is the people and the service. I shall say that the service provided by all staff in the Riad are the best in the world. From the moment I emailed the Riad for booking until the moment we left, we have received unbelievable outstanding services. The services provided by staff here are very thoughtful and attention to details, such as super efficient response every time I wrote to them; they provided a";5
Would definitely stay here again. Comfortable bed, nice shower, larger room than other NY hotels weâve stayed at. Next door to a couple great restaurants and a comedy club.  Staff was friendly, funny and helpful. Hotel is walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, subways.;5
We had an amazing time in New York made so much better by the fantastic location of the hotel. Very friendly staff especially Jeff on front door who always had a lovely smile and welcome on our return . Very clean and would recommend to pay a visit.;5
My wife and stayed here for 3 days at the end of January, the Rhiad is very traditional from the outside but inside the owner has managed to make 5 Star comfort blend with a very old building seamlessly. There has already been a lot written about the wonderful service you receive at this Rhiad, and it does not do justice, nothing is too much, snacks, drinks and even Pizza when I got fed up with Tagine was not too much trouble, guides all always provided when you leave the Rhiad to guide you through the maze of alleys, they lend you a pre-programmed phone to use for summoning a guide for when you return, but after a couple of trips it was not difficult to find our way through the alleys. I cannot find any criticism about this place. Anyone looking for some where  to stay in;5
Excellent, excellent! Highly recommend to others. The riad was cozy, intimate, charming and clean. It is a laid back atmosphere, yet the customer service was top-notch. The staff took care of all the little details for us, from planning dinners to setting up taxis, escorting us to the souks upon request. My husband and I enjoyed the many fireplaces, delicious and bountiful meals. Wifi is strong, so you don't have to worry about that. Very clean and nice rooms, and beautiful view of the medina on the rooftop. Honorable mention to staff member Inmane who went above and beyond with her personal touch. It's apparent how they prioritize great service and guests' satisfaction. The only thing I would change about my experience is my massage. I was booked for two hours and I only;5
"This was our first ever visit to New York, and was booked to celebrate my wife's Birthday. I had e-mailed the hotel prior to our visit, and upon arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded, and we were not disappointed with our room on the 36th floor with an unobstructed view of the Empire State Building; just what we requested. Miguel on the front desk was excellent and very helpful throughout our stay, especially so when our flights to Florida had been cancelled due to Hurricane Irma, which meant we had to stay an extra 2 days in New York. Miguel assured us that we would be able to stay with them and  that we could also stay in the same room.  The room itself was very spacious, spotlessly clean and the bed was so comfortable. We used both the Tick Tock diner (best ever";5
This was my sons and my first trip to New York. The staff was great, the room and view was amazing. Special thanks to Kader, and Jennifer at concierge desk. Great advise on how to see so much in such short time, and where to get some great pizza. Cant wait to go back again, Thanks for making this a special trip for us.;5
Glowing and brilliant praise to the team at Riad Kheirredine! This gem of a boutique hotel is simply fabulous. Gourmet dinners, bountiful breakfasts, gorgeous property. Mint tea by request at any hour. We were provided a cellphone and able to ask staff âwalkersâ to accompany us to places in the medina until we were familiar with the route. Our Fleur d'Orange and Imperial Musk suites were beautiful, painstakingly clean. There is an in-house hammam spa that we enjoyed tremendously. Elena is warm, gracious and personable. Riad Kheirredine exceeded all expectations. Thank you for such wonderful hospitality!;5
It is difficult to express in a few words how amazing the riad was from start to finish. It was an oasis of calm, impeccable warm service with beautiful surroundings and delicious food. We cannot recommend this place enough!!;5
My first stay in New York, on business, so I was very pleased to meet the friendly & helpful staff at check in. Majid on reception was very helpful in sorting out a superb room for me and checking later on in the week if all was good, which it was. The room was modern, clean, quiet and the bed very comfortable. Although I was not tempted by the breakfast on offer, I did occasionally sit down in the breakfast area for a coffee in the morning whilst planning my day.;5
My wife and I spent three nights in the Eucalyptus ( classic ) suite of the Riad Khierredine 6-9th Sept 2018. This Riad has c. 18 rooms or suites and is located in the Medina( old town). On arrival we were served with mint tea and briefed on the hotel and its facilities by Sarah, a delightful and very smart Moroccan/Italian lady,  who could not have been more helpful on this occasion and throughout our stay . Our suite was well appointed and very comfortable with a ( specially arranged) hard mattress which gave us three blissful nights of sleep. We were offered a choice of venues at which to eat breakfast and chose the rooftop, which gave beautiful views of the medina. We took full advantage of the free laundry service as well as the 24/7 free fruit/ tea/ coffee. Sarah debriefed;5
I've stayed at a variety of Manhattan hotels, but I haven't found anything better than Morningside in terms of value and quality. The rooms are extremely clean, service is friendly, and the rooms are warm in the wintertime. Moreover, the Inn is in close proximity to many excellent restaurants, pubs, and several subway stops. It's also located very near the M60 bus route from La Guardia Airport. Even though I was on a business trip and my office was paying for lodging, I still choose to stay at Morningside. I'll be back next year.;5
WE had a great two night stay - ideal location for Universal Studios, only minutes away on foot - we didn't bother with the shuttle. We arrived 10am after a 15 minute drive from Burbank Airport and gratefully accepted  the early check in for a fee of $25 .  Our room was a 2 large double and very comfortable for a family of four in one room, we all slept very well.  Our room was executive level allowing us all free continental buffet breakfast or full buffet for an extra cost of approx. $10, this was an excellent start to the day with plenty of choice of fruit, pastries, boiled eggs, salmon, bagels, doughnuts and excellent service for refills etc.  The location was ideal for our plans - Warner Bros Studio tour, Hollywood Boulevard were close by.;5
Fantastic for taking in the studio sights nearby. The property was minutes away, via their frequent shuttles, from Universal Studios. They gave outstanding value to our stay. High floor room provided scenic view of immediate areas. Be sure you keep the door latch on as staff will use key and enter if you don't.;5
"This hotel offers great value for the money! Perfectly clean, very well managed, and quiet.  It has a good (and safe) location right across the street from Central Park, just two minutes from the 110th Street C-Line subway station, which will have you in midtown Manhattan in 15 minutes. Also, check out the Park West Cafe&Deli, just one block away, for delicious and inexpensive Turkish food served by a very friendly owner. The thing that impressed me most about this property was the willingness of the staff, and the manager, Ari, to resolve a problem that occurred during our stay, on what was, apparently, the coldest night of the year;  the problem simply was that the heating system of the hotel couldn't keep up with an overnight outdoor temperature that fell to below zero";5
This hotel has a great location.. You are away half a block from the subway.. and only 3 stops away from the Walk of Fame. The staff is really welcome, and the breakfast was really good, with fresh backed muffins and omelets.. Whenever I go back to LA I`m definitely staying here.;5
If you need a hotel in the heart of Midtown this is it. Just off 8th ave and right oppersite Madison Sq Garden. Hotel is a gem if you love art deco as was built in 1929. Lobby is stunning. Landing was a little dark ad all the wood painted brown. Room was small but cosy and had everything you need. On site just off the lobby is a great dinner and on the otherside was a lovely restaurant so if u don't want to go out 9great if you have children with you ) ...what out for the cocktails they were strong !!. You really couldn't bet this hotel for location and facilities and a lesson in Art Deco ...just a note that reception will only change 100 dollars worth of travevellers cheques;5
We had arranged with the Riad to be picked up from the airport, which I strongly recommend as it makes the arrival very smooth. We were driven in a new Mercedes van, up to the point that driving was an option and then we were met by a hotel employee and a porter with a wheelbarrow who carried our luggage, to protect it from the street bumps!   We were greeted by Lamia who offered us mint tea and gave us information about our stay. We had reserved a classic suite and we were given Eucalyptus, a lovely suite with local colour and plenty of space. The big bed was very comfortable, the bathroom had fluffy big towels, slippers, bathrobes and all the toiletries and although on the small side was very functional.  So we got a phone in case we got lost, were offered help to go to places;5
I went to the Hilton Universal City earlier this year for a few days away from England. I'm not a huge fan of the Universal City theme park scene myself, but chose the hotel because of a good price deal.  I was a little dubious about the fact it was a Universal City hotel, and was a little worried it would be tacky. Not at all. Arriving at the hotel blearly eyed after the 11 hour flight I was greeted by friendly staff who got me to my room in no time! The hotel restaurant serves decently priced (and excellent) Mandarin cuisine, with the friendliest waiting staff I have come across in a long time. The highlight of the stay had to be the warmth of the valet parking staff - they knew me and my car, always greeted me and were very welcoming each time I returned to the hotel.  I was;5
Second stay at this Art Deco Hotel location is fantastic so convenient and a good base for exploring New York  Upgraded to refurbished room free of charge very nice room with modern shower and lots of room very clean and service good. Definitely stay here again. On site Tick Tock Dinner a great place to each;5
Hotel staff and housekeeping were both amazing at the Empire. We we're assisted with our bags and checked in, and out, in moments. Room was a bit cramped and small for the cost, but the location and service were impeccable. WiFi and hot water both a bit inconsistent.;5
Welcomed by Angelie, what a lovely lady!  It was my husbands birthday and she made our stay really special.  All the staff are excellent, the room was super clean, breakfast was plentiful and great quality.  We have stayed in London many times but this has to be the best,  The location is excellent, the staff are so helpful and obviously enjoy their jobs.  We are already planning next years birthday break. Well done Premier Inn, your staff are a credit to you.;5
From the moment we arrived to the point we sadly left the Riad Kheirredine has been all anyone could wish for when staying in this mind blowing city. The location perfect, the room was to die for (Imperial suites are a must) and the roof terrace a welcome oasis from the labyrinth below.  Most of all the Staff could not do enough for you, welcoming as per any hotel of this star rating, the staff here went way above that. Always friendly and attentive but not overbearing. Help was given when needed including guiding you through the small streets and just to make sure, the thoughtful touches made a difference, such as the emergency phone you get given... just in case you really get lost.  Quite simply.... We can not recommend this place enough..... thank you;5
It was just perfet. thanks a lot to Jerry and Zuli, for all your attentions and help. thanks for the room, was really nice. Apart from the Hotel that is so much, the location is also perfect. Close to everything, I even went jogging to central park (really nice experience), you can go in just 2 minutes!!!  kind regards, Audrey and David Prats.;5
if you are looking for a great modern style hotl with cool vibe and outstanding customer srevice , this is your place. i would specifically like to commend the gm mr mcmanus for his warmth and hospitality. rooms are ultra clean and comfortable. you cant go wrong at this hotel!!;5
Service was excellent, every need catered for. Spa was great, had a massage nearly every day. We spent a day sunbathing on the rooftop. Food was great. Honestly a great place to stay if you want to be in the medina!;5
I stay at the Empire because of its proximity-  my family live close by. More so it's right next to the Lincoln Centre and handy for the Metro and upper west side shops and restaurants. It's a warm friendly hotel with a lively bar.;5
We absolutely loved our stay here ... highly recommend room 1205 for amazing city views.  Probably the best part was how helpful Jeff was with our bags and helping with a car to the airport.  We will definitely stay here again!;5
The hotel is outstanding for service, features, and location. From the check in process to our departure and everything in between our stay was excellent, and made that way by the staff. The food in the restaurant was very good with a lot of options, and very helpful staff;5
I stayed here in February for my mums 60th birthday. The hotel was very accommodating and upgraded us to a better room which had views of the empire state building. They also gave us some complimentary bottles of wine and breakfast vouchers as this room was not available the first evening. The hotel staff could not do enough for us and also placed some birthday banners that I brought with me in the room so that my mum had a nice surprise when we returned to the room. This hotel is clean and an excellent location for the different sites. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I visited New York again!!;5
I had an amazing experience staying at the empire for the weekend! It's in a great location, has a rooftop pool/patio and an amazing staff! When our flight home to Toronto was cancelled, my friend and I were stuck in NY with no hotel reservation for the night. Jerry at the front desk was so accommodating and hooked us up with a great room for a reasonable rate! Overall, a very pleasant experience - highly recommended!;5
I really enjoyed the stay and being close to the airport is a plus. I would most definitely stay there again if Iâm ever in LA again.  The staff were very nice and if you ever needed something they are always there on time;5
Pleasant stay at the Hollywood hotel. Nothing but grade A staff. From check in to check out Pil helped us out. From local eateries to tours and attractions. Exceptional stay for our vacation. Great room in the third floor looking at the courtyard. We will be back.;5
Booked here whilst visiting NYC for my wife's birthday. Arrived easry hours, no wait g to check in, gentleman said, I see its someone's birthday and asked if my wife would prefer red or white, presented her with a bottle of wine and upgraded the room to a suit. This was perfect as both girls had their own double bed 1 was sofa but great) all very very comfortable. 2 rooms and well equipped bathroom. Fridge, safe and coffee machine. Really impressed. Lovely place to stay in a fantastic location. Staff helpful and friendly, never had to wait for lift. We all really enjoyed staying here and would stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you for making our stay so good. Fantastic trip!!!!;5
My girlfriend and I chose the hotel for our base from which to explore Hollywood in summer last year, and stayed for 9 nights.  - The room was nice, reasonably sized, clean and quiet. Our's overlooked the courtyard which is a pleasant little space. Ice machine in the corridor was handy. Coffee filter machine in the room was good. The pool was also nice though we didn't spend too much time there.   - The breakfast was a highlight - they make the waffles and omelettes (to your specification) in front of you and they are very tasty. The rest of the self serve breakfast spread is good too. The staff at breakfast were always courteous and friendly. The breakfast area is large and clean.  - The location is what really drew us to the hotel. The area is rough around the edges but the;5
Nice place, very clean and really close to Times Square and Central Park.  Service was great and they even texted me while I was in the city to see if they could help me with anything.  I would definitely stay there again.;5
Honors program paid for room with points very easy to use.  Across the street from Universal Studios, was able to experience Harry Potter before opening, Great!  Had great view of park and Valley.  Very comfortable.;5
We had a wonderful stay at the New Yorker Hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the view from our top floor room was breathtaking!  And we want to also mention that the sofa bed is the most comfortable that we've ever slept on in all our travels!;5
Best place to stay if your planning to visit Universal Studios Hollywood. They have everything you need also they have a bus that takes you and brings you back to the hotel. Am coming back for my next visit to Los Angeles and Universal Studios Hollywood.;5
We were much impressed with the hotel and staff. Our son is an amputee and needs a special chair for the shower. The hotel provided a chair, but it had a broken bracket, and the replacement chair also had a problem.  Antonio, the maintenance man that responded, ended up making a total of four trips to our room before he had the problem solved. Throughout the process, he was friendly and eager to ensure that were satisfied. That degree of customer service is too unusual these days, and he completely eliminated a problem that could have put a damper on our stay. Thanks and well done, Antonio!;5
We just returned from a visit to SoCal and we enjoyed it all, especially our 3 nights at the Hollywood Hotel. This was my 2nd time staying there since I was very pleased the first time 2 years ago. It was very relaxing there, especially sitting on our terrace and in the beautiful center courtyard. The room was very clean, including the full sized bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, and the room included a big screen TV, a workdesk, a microwave oven, a coffemaker, and a refrigerator. It even had an iron and ironing board. All the comforts of home, and very quiet there at night. OK. The room was a bit on the small side, but we requested a 1st floor room so it had a sliding door and a terrace to sit out on. The breakfast is included and its a full hot buffet with made-to-order;5
What a magnificent hotel. We checked in 19th November after a 8 hour flight we were ready for our room. We were on the 25th floor overlooking the city. The room was for five of us. On entering there was a sofa, tv, table and chairs a fridge and coffee maker. There was bath come shower and in the large bedroom was two double beds, plenty of room and spacious wardrobes and sets of drawers. A great room with history which was mahamod Ali stayed in that room after his fight with Joe Frazier. Photos of him everywhere.;5
Me and my friend (two girls) spent 3 night in the Riad Kheirredine the last week. We can say its one of the best place to be in Marrakesh, the hotel is very beautiful, the view from the rooftop is amazing, the swimming pool its very nice, our room its was really comfy and also the food its was really delicious but the most important thing its that all the people working there were really friendly and kind with us, we never felt scared even if we were just two girls, all the time when we wanted to go out the personal of the hotel take care of us and also they gave us a phone just in case if something happen, but we really recommend this hotel because you will feel more than welcome.;5
It's difficult to describe what a special place this is, without simply repeating what has already been written in so many reviews before. This was a first trip for us a couple and we couldn't have wished for a better choice.  Riad Kheirredine takes all of the qualities of wonderful Marrakech and raises them to a higher level still: charming, comfortable, magical, hospitable, elegant, romantic, great food....the list is endless.  But it's the service that elevates this place above pretty much everywhere either us has stayed over many years of travelling.  It's impossible to list all the ways in which every member of staff does their most to make sure that your trip is unforgettable and that a repeat visit is inevitable - but suffice to say that we arrived as guests and departed;5
I stayed here with my wife to take wedding photos. We started taking wedding photo tour from the hotel. Hotel staff permitted us to do and they gave us great present. When we came back from the photo tour and came into the room, we found wine bottle and plate to congratulate our wedding with strawberries. I really appreciate their present. I would like to stay there again.;5
We arrived on a very HOT day to NY. I had rented two rooms for two nights. The front desk was great and tried to get us on the same floor.  I requested a refrigerator in my room and it was delivered almost immediately!  The room was great! Very clean! The bathroom was a little small but very modern and spotless! It was very quiet at night and I loved the big flat screen TV! We had a great quick breakfast downstairs in the diner type restaurant and loved being within walking distance to almost everything!! The staff was friendly and checkout was easy! I would make this my go to hotel for all of my visits except for one missing thing...no room service. I like the option of coming back late and being able to get something delivered to my room.  However, if that's not important to;5
The hotel was right next to Lincoln Center and many of the Upper Westside were very close. Starbucks and Duane Reade were also pn one side of the hotel for convenience. Room was excellent and so was the bed. Need to improve the elevators. Great stay!;5
Good business hotel - great room service and nice Regency Lounge for those that qualify.  The staff are very friendly and willing to help.  Breakfast each morning was served just as ordered (I went with off-menu instead of buffet).;5
Absolutely love this hotel we stayed for 5 nights .We arrived late after a bit of a stressful journey but the gentleman that checked us in was very welcoming I think he was from morrocco. The doorman Hector was so helpful and friendly.Lovely rooms perfect location  would highly recommend. All staff very friendly and helpful .;5
My husband and I used to live in NYC and we now travel back frequently for my medical check-ups. For the past 2 visits, we stayed at the New Yorker. It's a  beautiful old hotel, rich in history, relatively low in price and conveniently located next door to Penn Station. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel , a fact that we greatly appreciated this last visit, when the temperature dropped to the teens and we didn't want to go outside. The best part of the hotel is the staff- everyone from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping staff are friendly, respectful and responsive.;5
Super unique hotel tucked far away from the hustle. At the west end of Jane Street with views of the Hudson and Jersey. The interior is pretty neat and the common areas are filled with character. We had a bunk room which was unbelievably small, but it really made no difference to us, I was travelling with my father and we didn't spend much time in the room anyways. We obviously had no bathroom in out room due to the size, but the common/shared bathrooms were squeaky clean and the showers ran hot water at all hours of the day.   Overall a great value for the location and there seems to be plenty going on just a short walk from the general area. The night we were there the ground floor common room was closed for a private party which looked really neat. If you're just looking for;5
From the moment that I made an enquiry to stay here, I knew I had found somewhere special.  My husband and I stayed for three days and loved every moment, from the wonderful rooftop bar and seating area,  the comfortable and stylish seating areas and our huge beautiful room, to the immaculate service we received.  The place was teaming with friendly and helpful staff who couldnât do enough to help.  We were given a mobile phone to use if we were lost, and guided into the MÃ©dina each day.  Marrakech can be quite confusing, but staying  at the Kheirredine was so reassuring!;5
Very friendly staff at check in and out. Great security at the elevator banks to filter in and out on who should be there and not. Very historic hotel property since many celebrity guests and other famous people like Tesla lived in that hotel.;5
Great customer service and very warm greeting.. Even after my stay I got a financial issue and it was fixed by lady called Neida .. she is the best .. honestly all the stuff there were so cooperative.;5
It was great staying in New York at Wyndham New Yorker Hotel,  with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building!!! Thanks 4 the gr8 service...;5
Hotel was incredible.  Service staff were incredibly friendly.  Hotel is walking distance to Universal Studios.  Room was immaculate with a great view.;5
This was our second visit to the New Yorker Hotel, the first being some years ago when a power outage hit the whole of the Eastern seaboard. This visit was less tense! The hotel is famous for being the last home of the scientist, Tesla. There is a plaque on his room...3327...and an exhibition in the basement. The hotel exudes Art Deco splendour in the public areas, while the rooms retain a sort of faded beauty. People return time and time again...we've already made reservations for our next trip...and it is easy to see why...it's built for comfort, in a great location, the staff are friendly and helpful...may she long reign as the Grande Dame of Manhattan!;5
I always enjoy staying at the Ameritania Hotel.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  A great location and value.  hotel is walking distance to Broadway Theatres, shopping, Central Park and Times Square.;5
Friendly staff, clean and neat place to stay :) I stayed all alone at the hotel but  friendly staff made me comfortable. I was also able to enjoy roof top bar with my friend and they loved it. I want to comeback someday soon:);5
Was in Hollywood on Business, We took out a Jnr Suite  & Double Room in July 2013 for a week. The rooms are well appointed, clean, the hotel is a classic style, yet it's not dated and looks like new.     The staff were really accommodating & helpful. Roman & his staff were outstanding. no request was to hard, or a problem. The free b/fast was high quality. the only negative was I couldn't take my coffee from the b/fast room in a mug, it had to transferred to a plastic cup...  But when you get 1000 things right, you cant hold it against the hotel for getting one thing wrong. We will be staying again in June / July in 2014, as we got great value for our money.  I would gladly recommend this Hotel for Style, Value & Friendliness.;5
We live in NYC but wanted to treat ourselves to a staycation to celebrate an anniversary. Check-in was seamless & Jamole was incredibly kind by upgrading us to a suite. I've worked in hotels for a long time, and I was overwhelmingly pleased with the entire staff. From the bellmen to Front Desk to Housekeeping. The location is perfect if you're visiting NYC for an artistic experience. Steps from Lincoln Center. Rooms are very nicely arranged, the decor is modern without being obnoxious. Very comfy beds. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Loved this hotel for our family holiday - really convenient location particularly for Midtown and Central Park and very clean and modern decor.  Pasquale very friendly and efficient checking us in.  Would definitely go again if visiting New York.  WIFI available in the lobby.;5
my stay was incredible, I had a beautiful view and apart from the chef Hugo made me one of the best omelette of my life and some delicious pancakes. 100% recommendable because it has one of the best services.;5
We first checked in an were greeted by Adriana at the front desk. Very pleasant and easy check in with a huge perk! She upgraded our room from a double to a suite. We had a corner suite with a great view of the Lincoln Center. Room was very clean, I called for an iron and heard a knock on my door with the iron in less than 5 minutes. I will definetly be back. Thanks    Great bar and nice rooftop bar scene.;5
"We always stay here...the location is fantastic... just minutes from Columbus Circle and Central Park and across the street from the Lincoln Center!  The subway access is fantastic and the great walkable restaurants are endless!  The rooftop (summer only) is also a great retreat after a day ""in the city"".  The theatre district is less than a 30 minute walk.  Columbia University is a speedy 15 minutes on the subway, so our daughter can zip down to the Empire or we can easily visit her!  We LOVE the Empire!";5
Lovely hotel , nice surroundings, great staff.  In a perfect location , near Times Square, but away from the hustle and bustle.  Great for buses and subway and plenty nice restaurants in surrounding area.;5
We really enjoyed this hotel.  Built in 1929, it has many modern improvements while keeping the retro look.  Staff was very friendly,  place was very clean, no bedbugs,;5
The room size, amenities and cleanliness were fine and what we expected for the price. We wanted a place close to the airport for connecting flights the next day. We were at this hotel twice, once in each direction. On check-in the second time, the room key offered opened our door, but the room was already occupied. The clerk found us another room immediately and we were given a fruit plate as an apology. That was fine and we were satisfied.;5
Great location for 24 hour  in NYC, walked to Time Square & Empire State  Building. We explored by foot until after 12am. The view of nigh lights from our room was beautiful. Hotel staff ++  The hotel held our luggage for the day, while we explored the city.;5
From the moment you step into this hotel it was amazing.  The hotel and room are just beautiful.  What made the difference though is the wonderful and courteous staff that went above and beyond in providing service.  Will be back.;5
Michelle Wong, Manager Guest Relations was very visible throughout the property and was singularly responsible for my successful business stay!  Upon check-in Santos Guzman, Housekeeping Supervisor, presented himself to me and assured me that everything was in order for my business stay.  As a result, the room temperature was maintained at constant temperature I requested, the shower with instant-on hot water was always at the right water pressure, the super comfy bed was prepared with nice, cool heavenly  e!  Even though this was a business stay, we still had fun because of Carlos.  As a Hilton Honors member since 1999, Matt La Vine, Managing Director, has made my business stay truly memorable and highly successful.;5
My boyfriend and I stayed at the riad for our first trip to Marrakech. The riad itself is absolutely stunning and a welcome escape from the madness of the medina.  The riad staff helped us arrange all of our reservations and even managed to book us a last minute full day excursion to the Atlas Mountains which we loved. Complete with travel, a waking guide and a fully catered Moroccan lunch in the mountains.   The staff at the riad think of every possible need you might have and then some. Should you get lost or not want to walk alone at night through the maze of the medina a member of staff will gladly meet and escort you back to the riad. Even with your GPS phone they provide for you, you can phone or WhatsApp a riad member of staff any time of the day or night for assistance.;5
Amazing place, quirky interior, warm inside, staff really friendly and helpful. Jeff is great, ask him anything and you will be sorted.  The hotel is in a great location on Broadway half way between Times Square and Central Park. Loved it.  Great place.  Amy and Pete;5
Outstanding, extremely friendly and helpful staff, warm, welcoming atmosphere, spacious and wonderfully furnished room and beautiful hotel appointments. One of our most favorite hotels, which keeps bringing us back. A tremendous value for the accommodations, location and amenities.;5
Can anyone help me to find a shop In midtown that sells some backwoods and swisher sweet please as I love cigars and have always wanted to try them and am not to sure where to find any shops I have looked everywhere for one thanks ðð;5
Hilton is an amazing chain, however, we decided to try one of their amazing suits for 6 people and oh man... just unbelievable, and the highlight of it all was Ms Pamela down at the front desk, shes caring, sweet, nice and shes very professional... shout out to Pamela at the front desk.;5
Still through all this going on Pil is still here at work giving his best service ever. Iâm truly surprise how cool ð he is and how he is relaxed and makes you feel safe. The hotel is being very accommodating to guest since most places are closed. Pil said they will be here for guest that need the help. We need more of that right now.   Highly recommended, if you are looking for a safe place come to the Hollywood Hotel.;5
Riad Kheirredine is defenitely a place you don't want to leave again: a wonderful location in the heart of the Medina, with roomes beautifully decorated with great attention to detail, a patio always nicely decorated with flowers and an amazing roof terrace where you can enjoy a glass of nice morrocan wine or have breakfast under the morning sun. Breakfast as well as the dinner we had on our first evening in the Riad was excellent. The staff of Riad Kheirredine is more than helpful and obliging. They were all so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  They even provide you with a mobile phone in case you get lost and somebody will search for you in the labyrinthine streets of the Medina. Many thanks again to the team as a whole for these wonderful days in Marrakech!;5
I have to commend the staff. They've been very helpful and accommodating from my arrival and departure - from conceirge to front desk. This hotel knows the importance of customer service and how it ripples through excellent guest experience. They may not be on the top finest hotels you could find in NYC but the staff are truly gems. Well-managed hotel.   Thank you Ameritania! You just earned another loyal guest.   I can't wait to be back.;5
Chris has to be the most knowledgeable concierge I have ever come across.  He planned each day for us and we didn't miss a thing.  He explained the subway system so well, that after a couple of days or so, I had it down.  He told us about places I didn't even know existed and without him, our vacation wouldn't have been the same.  THANK YOU CHRIS!;5
We will give a review of the hotel when the trip is done... In 4 days. But the intro was outstanding from the guy at the front desk.... Thanks ZE...on our way up to check out the pool deck at the rooftop...;5
Would definitely recommend staying here, it's a great location, very nice hotel w/ old school charm and friendly staff;5
Had a very nice stay at Hyatt Regency LAX.  Check in was fast.  Stayed at an executive suite which was very spacious.  Breakfast at the club lounge was very good.  We used Uber to travel to Manhattan Beach, about 15 minutes away.  Enjoyed a nice lunch at The Strand House, which had a fabulous view of Manhattan Beach.  For $85 we were allowed late check out at 8pm, since our flight was not until 11pm.  Would definitely stay again.;5
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 10 days in June and couldn't have had a better hotel! Location is perfect, a minute walk from Columbus circle, just off Broadway on West side, and 10 minutes walk from Times Sq! On our first night we went up to the rooftop bar which is fantastic! The luminous sign ""Empire Hotel"" above is a NYC staple!  I'm sure not all rooms are the same, but we stayed in a twin deluxe and it was perfect. A/C worked no problem, room was clean when we arrived and kept clean throughout our stay.  Staff was very kind and welcoming and happy to help with suggestions on where to go and eat. Mackenzie checked us in and out and was very nice and fast. She even helped with printing out our boarding passes.  There was a minor hick-up with the dry cleaning service - my";5
We stayed here last week and it was amazing, it was a present for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it! The service from all the staff was superb! With only 6 rooms there is a feeling that they really want you to have the best time but they also keep their distance when you want alone time. It was perfect..... we took the arranged airport transfer and I would recommend it as it took the pressure and hassle out of it.  Its excellent value for money and the food and juices are excellent. One on the nights my boyfriend did not feel well and couldn't eat dinner, when we were checking out they did not charge us for his meal, which was really nice. Most other places would of charged us.   The breakfast is to die for. When booking this trip I browsed loads of Riads and I am so;5
Wonderful property,great service,short walk to Universal Studios and a fantastic seafood buffet. That says it all.;5
Love it here. Hotel is high end with facilities to match. It is located a few minutes from the airport and the hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the airport. The hotel does not have laundry for self service, something to be mindful of if travelling with the family. Love it here. Definitely be back.;5
Shoutout Pil showed a lot of customer support positive review. The room was excellent and clean. I will most likely stay here again and let my friends and family know about the Hollywood hotel again so then can have a great time.;5
I've never seen an affordable hotel in a great location make such terrific use of minimal space. I've stayed in $300+/night business and conference hotels that can't fill a 1000 square-foot suite with as many amenities as The Jane packed into their cabin car rooms: a floor-to-ceiling mirror, enough hooks to hang a week's worth of clothes, firm beds with comfortable bedding, free Wi-Fi, free bottled water, two flat-screen televisions (one for each bunk), bathrobes, slippers, many electrical outlets, sufficient lighting, a modern alarm clock with an iPod dock, and a personal HVAC unit with a remote. The only thing the rooms are missing is a fold-out ironing board and iron, and don't expect to get a view (though you might - The Jane is right on the Hudson River facing New Jersey).;5
Me and my wife just had one of the most fabulous stays at Riad Kheirredine . We have stayed at several 5 star hotels , quaint airbnb's , boutique apartments and host of similar stays around the world , but never before have experienced the high level of service and luxury offered by Riad Kheirredine . Right from the time we stepped into this lovely riad till the time we left everything was service par excellence . I would like to focus more on the luxury suites  offered at the riad but again and again what I remember is the superior level of service offered at this riad . Whether is was suggestion of local restaurants , golf booking , sightseeing trips , local transport via car or tuktuk everything was just superlative . Within the riad , unlimited flow of coffee , orange juice;5
Stayed in the New Yorker for a week as my mums 60th birthday gift. The hotel, when hearing it was my mums birthday, upgraded us to a city view room, free of charge. The hotel itself is very central to all attractions, yet not right in the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The diner attached to the hotel is open 24/7 and has the best cheesecake. I particularly loved the fact that you have to show your room key to enter the elevator, I felt it was a very safe hotel. The rooms, staff & hotel are amazing, this is my 2nd visit to the New Yorker & I will definitely stay again on my next visit.;5
I returned to the Empire Hotel for my recent trip to New York City, having liked it so much last time. I had an upgraded room (115), which gave me enough space for Yoga practice and offered a nice view of the Lincoln Centre. The room was light on sunny days which was a bonus for NY where the tall buildings block the light in many hotel rooms. The corridor was quite dark though and I would bring a torch next time.The staff are extremely helpful and always friendly. The concierge offers expert advice on what to do and where to go and can book any shows for a small fee. My room did not have hanging space but there was a small chest of drawers for my clothes. The bathroom had a decent size shower and was well equipped with shower gel and shampoos and conditioners. The king size bed;5
Enjoyed my stay, great staff, love the onsite food options, beautiful lobby, central location, easy to get transportation from building, love the Tik Tok + the tavern + steak houseâ-fantastic shower with hot hot water and strong water pressure, updated room with easy to use tv;5
Got here late on a Sunday evening.  Room was ready, check-in quick.  WiFi free.  Room was dated but clean and exactly as advertised.  A little walk (or shuttle ride) to universal studios and city walk.  Valet was quick and responsive.;5
This hotel is AWESOME!! The staff was always nice to us and greeted us each and every single time we walked in and  out of the hotel. The rooms were very nice and the location is perfect when you visit Universal Studios and if you don't want to walk the short distance to the park, you can ride the bus that picks you up right in front of the hotel and when your day is finished they will take you back to the hotel. We was so tired and thirsty from Universal Studios park, it was nice to have ice cold water with bit of lemon and lime at the front when you walked in. They also had fruit you could take to your room at the front desk and we had a beautiful view of Hollywood Hills from our room. The only complaint that I have were the valet parking was a little pricey at the buffet at;5
Has everything, great-great-great- location but more importantly, the people that worked there seemed real, like real people, not harried or super professional. It was not a chain, at least it seemed like a boutique.  The breakfast and brunch, on the rooftop, was really really good and reasonably priced.;5
Attendance from all the hotel staff, services offered and cleanliness of the rooms, in my stay, were of great quality. Even though I did not enjoy the hotel bar, the little time I was there was very well treated.;5
great stay! clean and staff is very nice ! cute little restaurant inside, HEATED POOL with sea salt water. amazing stay, I would suggest to rent a car if you plan on going to Hollywood or anywhere else besides the airport;5
Terrific location for people who visit Universal Studios. The food is pretty expensive,but excellent quality. Service is excellent and the staff is very helpful. The shuttle to Universal is a great asset.;5
My visit was amazing. The staff was very kind. Adam and Sarah particularly. The room is very comfortable and cleaning services are very well. The position was strategic, itâs very close to the Central park and city centre. Itâs close to the subway, too. The roofbar Is one of the best place in NY. Iâll come back there soon.;5
Took a vacation with my family and let me tell you that it was the best hotel stay we've ever had.. Great staff, great customer service, nice clean rooms. Nancy really made sure we had a great stay in the hotel... Needles to say I will book my next vacation there again. Thanks a lot !!;5
Excellent hotel very near to the airport.  Fast shuttle service and good food options. Very quiet and clean rooms. The front desk was super helpful and friendly. We will definitely stay here the next time we need a hotel near LAX;5
My overall experience was great. Moving to the upper floor was certainly an improvement but beds still are uncomfortable. Rooms are clean and staff mostly friendly, some more than others. General front desk manager, Curt Horner is a great guy and very pofessional. Wifi definately needs improvement. My biggest complaint. Elevators are quite slow with a long wait time. Overall the hotel is good for your money spent.;5
I was lucky enough to get this hotel through booking with a discount. And I truly hope I get this opportunity again, the hotel is located next to the 34 St - Penn Station and is on a 10 minutes walk to Times Square, pretty much the perfect location. There is also a Taco Bell Cantina in front of it if you guys are feeling hungry at 2 am.  The hotel itself is beautiful, is probably one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed on, given the opportunity I would stay here again and again. We got lucky to get a Empire State view and that was the cherry to the cake. it was amazing.;5
- we arrived a 7am and there was no rooms available so we stored our bags and enjoyed the breakfast buffet  - buffet was decent for price 23/person... Lots of Asian inspired food and varieties of yogurts, but eggs and waffles were cold two mornings in a row -bathroom has great mirror lighting and the bed was comfy -great view of universal from our room on 17th floor -nice piano bar at night with great bar snacks.... Don't get the spring rolls they didn't taste fresh and came with frozen pre cut fries  -great location for walking to universal;5
Rooms and common area kept clean.  Everything in good working order.  Rooms are from an early era, so small.  Water temp fluctuates, so be careful, old two faucet system without balance.  All the staff was nice and professional.;5
I stayed at the Hollywood hotel for 5 days after travelling the US for nearly a month. What separates the Hollywood hotel from all the other hotels I stayed at was definitely the customer service, most notably from Cecille. Not only was the service from Cecille very personalised, it was also genuine and demonstrated her sincerest desire that my boyfriend and I have the most pleasant stay at the hotel. As it was our final leg of our holiday we first thought that we would not be able to maximize our time spent in l.a because our lack of research on the area, however after a brief chat with Cecille upon checking in she instantaneously opted to help us organise all the sights and scenes the area has to offer. She gave us maps, genuine advice and all the help we needed, leaving us;5
LAX is a very active/crowded airport. Staying at the Hyatt Regency Airport Hotel made life really easy. The Hotel was recently refurbished and access the LAX was convenient. Iâd recommend it to anyone.;5
Having read the reviews I was not expecting much from this property. And while there were certain things about the hallways and room that were worn down, this did not detract from a great stay. The room was spacious and I liked the feel of the hotel. Nice quant lobby and a perfect location for what I needed. The subway always stop at the 96th street station which is right outside the hotel.  I will come back again and have already booked for February when the rates are much cheaper then December.;5
The hotel was soo GREAT for me and my family. The rooms was soo clean and big. The view was nice. My girl really like the beds and how comfortable they were. The location to rhe theme park was in walking and my girls really liked that. The  persron who ws ourvroom service was very nice to them and this was they first time have room service. We have alway rent a Condo. This was the frist time at a hotel. So its was very important to us that everything go well. So we were very HAPPY and PLEASE with HILTON. THANKS;5
Nicole was great! The hotel is right near restaurants and a short Uber to shopping. The customer service is excellent. The rooms are nice and extremely affordable for the services they offer. My 4 night stay has been excellent;5
I mainly stayed there while on business but had the family with me and we were able to enjoy Universal together. I had a corner room with a great view and it was really nice and spacious. Housekeeping kept the room nice and clean despite the mess my kids made. They always responded to our requests promptly and checked in with us a couple of times to make sure everything was ok When they found out it was my birthday as well, I found a nice piece of cake waiting for us in the room along with a card personally signed by multiple staff members. It was a great surprise that made me really happy When we changed our plans and had to check a day early, they were understanding and I got a smaller late charge fee instead of a full night charge, which I really appreciated. Besides that the;5
What a wonderful hotel this was I can honestly say that the only thing wrong with the hotel was there was no tea or coffee. The staff were great the room was clean and the breakfast was good.  While we were there we went on a tour to all the hot spots and the tour guide was brilliant his name was Julienne i would definitely recommend the tour to any one who goes there especially if you like walking.;5
Jennifer at the desk was amazing! I booked a suit for my daughter's 23 birthday and she upgraded us to a corner suit with a great view of Lincoln center. She made a great start to a great stay! Thank you Jennifer!;5
I'm currently writing this review from my bed in the New Yorker. I actually couldn't wait until I got home to write this review. I am super impressed by the hotel and the super friendly and helpful staff. I booked this trip for my mum's birthday amd to keep the cost low (as it was my treat) I just booked us a double room, which may I add we would have been fine with. Upon checking in they said 'just a minute, I see there are two of you and just the one bed, I'm gonna give you a bigger room'. I was over the moon. They went on to mention that the room they were giving us had the most amazing views. I've stayed in NY many times and each time I was here my only views were of offices! The views from our room are spectacular. Check the pictures below. The New Yorker is in such a great;5
First visit to NYC, stayed in New Yorker for 6 days. Check in 4pm but hubby started vomiting whilst sitting in Lobby waiting on room. Upgraded to first room avail which was exec double. Lovely fresh spacious room, coffee machine, quiet area on 32nd floor. Staff are all lovely and approachable. Handy to have a diner and restaurant attached to hotel. Very central to Times Square, MSG, ESB, Penn Station, Macyâs.  McDonalds & Starbucks over the road. Housekeeping left room spotless. Would happily stay there again and highly recommend.;5
I booked this hotel for my sister and brother-in-law. Admittedly they visited in September but only just got around to leaving a review on their behalf.  We booked their stay at the Riad as I had visited myself with my girlfriend a couple of years ago and had a wonderful time, so thought this would make a perfect for their 10 year wedding anniversary.  When making the reservation, I contacted the hotel a few months beforehand to make all of the arrangements and the staff were really excellent about it, all the preparations were easy to do, and the instructions they sent me to pass to my sister as they arrived were excellent, and made travelling very easy.  From what my sister and brother-in-law told me, the hotel completely surpasses my expectations.  Upon arrival, they had;5
Great location with free shuttle to universal. Ate in the restaurant several times and the food was excellent. Great service from all including, bellmen, front desk, concierge, and restaurant staff. Very nice room with very comfortable beds.;5
110 people from FL stayed to either perform or attend the performance of students from the Durant High School band perform at Carnegie Hall.  The location was terrific for sightseeing and subway access.  The rooms offered a variety in size and view but were all CLEAN and KEPT.  The staff were helpful and professional considering the immense amount of traffic and guests constantly in and out.  We always felt safe walking around regardless of time of day or night.;5
I don't know why some reviews slam this place or the staff, maybe they caught someone on a bad day. All I can say is that we had a positive experience. We have stayed at a LOT of hotels around the US and around the world, and this is a very decent hotel. We have also stayed at the Waldorf and the Hampton Inn near 8th and 51st. The Waldorf is a pain because it is not near anything, the Hampton is a bit nicer than the Empire, but it depends on where you want to be. If you need to be near the Lincoln Center, Julliard, or Fordham, stay at the Empire! The room was clean, although the beds were a bit old but I slept fine. Bell service was great and the front desk staff was friendly.;5
Very nice and clean. Beautiful decor. Comfortable bed. Great location to stay over after concerts at the Beacon Theater. Lobby bar is fun place to hang out and so is next door - PJ Clarkâs? A lot of families with children as well as couples, groups etc.;5
Hotel with excellent service, excellent ambiance and a great rooftop bar with direct view on Broadway and Lincoln Center. Rooms are small but very efficient and modern. Staff is very friendly and helpful.;5
The Hilton Universal City is in an exceptional location - If you book a room on the upper floors, you will have great views of the city, Hollywood Hills or Universal Studios. Certainly the hotel is one of the best Hiltons I have stayed in - Great staff, very friendly and nothing too much trouble. The outdoor pool and poolside bar area is something not to miss - Very relaxing. The hotel is well located for Universal Studios and only a short drive to Sunset Boulevard. We've stayed in several LA Hotels in the past, and this one is one of the best and well worth the money. Well done to the management team - They run a great hotel very well.;5
The Empire Hotel was a fabulous place to stay in the Upper West End. Next to the Lincoln Center. Great shopping and a variety of places to eat and socialize. Next to Central Park and the Upper Manhattan area.;5
The location just perfect for universal studios visit, the shuttle bus runs almost every 10 minutes, the hotel location is also close to other tourist attractions around the city, staff are very cheerful and welling to help guests with a smile.;5
We stayed for five nights in a 2 Queen Beds Universal Studios View room.  The room was attractive, well equipped, clean and the view was spectacular.  The staff we always happy to help with any issue brought to their attention and were a pleasure to deal with.  The short 10-minute walk to the park makes it a breeze to have a midday break if thatâs what you want/need.  I recommend this Hotel and would consider staying there again..;5
This lovely hotel is well-situated with convenient transportation, a fun diner in the lobby and clean, well-appointed rooms. We had a great view of Madison Square Gardens, could walk to the Empire State Building and many other attractions, but it was away from the crowds of Times Square.;5
"Perfect location if your plans include a visit to Universal Studios. The hotel offers a shuttle but it may be faster to walk coming back as it makes a stop at the Sheraton next door. Self-parking is about $31/day (with taxes); parking at Universal ranges from $25-$50/day.  Couldn't say more about the friendly staff throughout the property, except for the one woman by the pool who seemed grouchy when we asked where the towels were. We didn't let her ruin our stay, though; our family enjoyed the hotel's amenities (lawn games, pool, hot tub and gym).";5
This hotel is historic and in a very good location in New York.  There is an amazing art deco style lobby,  the security is good as they check your key card when you enter the elevator area and the rooms are comfortable.  Our room wasn't an outside one but that didn't matter because we were hardly ever in it.  The cleaner did a great job everyday.  Everyone is very welcoming and polite. As I've mentioned the location is great not very long to times square and if you walk out the door and go to the street corner on your right you will see the empire state building and carrying on going to your right is the massive new york post office building! There is a subway station entrance near by and Penn station.  The big bus tour bus stops right outside on the red route stop 15. It's;5
"The hotel is well centred and ideal for a ""touristy"" manhattan stay. The staff were lovely especially Jeff who was on the door for most our stay, gave us lovely pointers and was an absolute gem. Would definitely stay here again :)";5
This is the 6th time I think we have stayed at this hotel.Perfect location.Beautiful hotel.Staff fantastic.The first room allocated was on 36th floor.Amazing view,but room was too small and bathroom was tiny.At front desk we spoke to Driss who quickly sorted us another bigger room on the 21st floor.Wonderful.;5
My friend and I spent four nights at Astor on the Park in mid-March.  We had a wonderful experience there.  The hotel staff was friendly, and our room was ready and waiting for us right at check-in time.  The room was great - clean and attractive with a good-sized bed and a very nice private bathroom.  We were never too cold, despite frigid temperatures outside.  A subway station was just three blocks away - an easy five minute (or less) walk.  The area was well-lit and highly trafficked - as two young women alone, we didn't feel nervous in this neighborhood.  I think the key to enjoying this (or any) hotel is to do your homework and know what to expect.  In all the negative reviews I've read about this hotel, I think the problem lies with guest expectations, not the hotel;5
I have been staying at the New Yorker Hotel for many years & it is my favorite by far in NYC.  When I go to the city I travel to other boroughs & areas outside of the city & being the hotel is one block from PENN Station you can get anywhere easily.  I come in by Amtrak from Denver get off the train & walk across the street to the hotel & when I leave I cross the street & take Amtrak to Newark Airport or another train from PENN station to one of the other airports. Among being the cheapest hotel in Midtown by far what makes this hotel so good among all the others are the people that work there. In the 10 hotels I have been to this year they are the only one that has full staffing & are offering all there services. It is the only hotel that offered daily housekeeping & room;5
We couldn't have loved our stay more. The riad is stunning, intimate and served as the perfect introduction to Marrakech. Our room was tastefully decorated and special touches like coffee, cookies, fruits etc were much appreciated.   Breakfast was available all day and we opted to enjoy it on the rooftop terrace with its spectacular views over the city. However most of all what we truly appreciated was the warm and incredibly hospitality staff. They were so considerate and always made the effort to go the extra step, for example making sure my wife and her friends had slippers at their disposal on the walk back to the riad, a phone, having a member of staff walk with us first few days as we acclimatized etc. we felt taken care of at all times.  All in all, we had a truly;5
Considering all the big brand names with big hotel buildings the Ameritania Could be considered almost a charming boutique hotel, with 12 floors with a mixture of a classical property in the outside and modern and beautiful rooms. And just 4 blocks from Times Square. Perfectly clean and all the friendly  staff compromised to a very clean room and hotel. The exact distance to be calm and secure for walking after the district theater shows and near from all the good restaurants and stores without the noise. The only thing missing is David Letterman in next Ed Sullivan Theather!!!!;5
Really enjoyed a recent stay in the Hilton at Universal City by the theme park and studios.   Meals here are first rate, the seafood buffet with mounds of crab legs, shrimp, oysters, salmon, sushi and all the trimmings rivals anything I've seen.   The breakfast buffet is huge with all the normal offerings plus a whole set of Asian items like Dim Sum, Miso Soup, etc. There's a European breakfast component too with the cold cuts and cheeses by the plateful. Orange juice is freshly squeezed right in front of you and there also a chef making eggs and omelets to order.   Only drawback for me is the older bathroom with little counter space and counter top is only thirty inches high, which is too low for today's standard of 36-inch counter heights.  Parking is extra but easy in/out.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania over the 2019 Labor Day weekend. The location is fantastic. Just around the corner from the Stephen Colbert (Ed Sullivan) theater, five short blocks to Central Park and seven blocks to Times Square. There is so much to see and do right in this area. My wife and I like to walk so we walked from the hotel west to get on the High Line, walked down to Chelsea Market and then back. Itâs not a bad walk but if you have children they will get worn out. The hotel is also close to public transit. About five blocks away is the 47-50 streets Rockefeller station. We got on there and took the subway to York St in Brooklyn, spent time in the Dumbo area- lots of places to eat/snack and then walked back over the Brooklyn bridge. The Amertaniaâs location makes;5
We visited New York for a long weekend and the Empire Hotel was amazing! The lobby was spacious and had a lot of room to hang out, the rooms were clean and spacious, and the staff at the hotel was awesome and accommodating! The manager Tommy went above and beyond for us and was super friendly. The hotel did a great job and Iâd stay here again!;5
Great little hotel with an excellent location to Greenwich Village and the meatpacking district. About ten minutes walk from a subway station and two minutes to the high line. Rooms are very small, but that is the point. They are perfectly formed with everything you need including towels, AC,TV, phone, internet and dressing gowns. I personally would have preferred better lighting as it was quite dim. The bathrooms are communal (i.e. Not split by gender) which doesn't bother me as everything was well divided and lockable. Also shampoo, conditioner and shower gel provided.  House keeping was quite early. I arrived on the red eye the night before so was exhausted. I got a knock at 9am and they came back within 30 minutes. I could hear them knocking their way down the corridor. It;5
I try to stay at this hotel when in the area.   Great location and views, spacious rooms, good amenities and always friendly staff.  Very convenient to Universal Studios. Park your car at the hotel to save on parking at Universal Studios, as it is a short walk to CityWalk and the front gate at Universal.;5
Hands down the best hotel to stay if visiting Universal Studios. You can walk to the park or Citywalk. There is a shuttle that runs all day. Very clean and the staff are the nicest most considerate that I have ever encountered. Highly recommend and will definitely be back again.;5
A beautiful art-deco hotel situated on 8th Ave. Very friendly staff, a 24 hour diner on site, with a fantastic Italian and Steakhouse all on site.Gym also available. You don't need to leave the hotel! However, you'd miss Empire State, Madison Square Gardens, Macy's (ALL within 5 minutes walk)-in fact, everything you think of Manhattan wise. Central Park and the Museums are around 20 minutes away.  I walked 12 miles in one day, in an area of around 20 blocks! You can spend a day (and walk that much) in Central Park and still not cover it all! Loved it, hoping to return...;5
Great location opposite the BEST Cantina. Massive place but higher floors have less rooms, quieter. Great facilities in room (internet/tv/cable). Comfortable beds and a great view of downtown from the 39th floor.;5
The hotel is lovely - modern, clean and comfortable. Was here with a group for a business trip and had a great time, but what really made our stay especially wonderful was the unbelievably top notch service we received from Cairo in the Regency Club. He was so friendly and helpful, and he made our group feel at home and welcomed. That made it feel really special to be there. We all kept raving about how superb he was during the rest of our stay in LA!;5
fantastic place clean and comfortable , happy smiling helpful staff who were always willing to help working hard to make you feel at home.  I would defiantly go back and for longer as our visit was brief and we had a lot to fit in so we didn't spend a lot of time at our hotel;5
3rd time to this hotel. Once again not disappointed.... booked this hotel a few months ago through Expedia. When we arrived we was a little disappointed with our room, but went and had a word at reception and was given a much bigger room and not charged any extra!!! Staff are so friendly, especially Suzie on the concierge desk (what a lovely, friendly woman) I can not fault this hotel one bit. Rooms are lovely and clean. Great view from our window. One side Empire State Building and the other side Madison square gardens.... although we have not spent a lot of time in our room, it's nice to know we are going to get a peaceful nights sleep when we return in the evenings... if you can stay here I would highly recommend it, as it is the perfect location.....;5
We love this hotel! The room is beautiful, well lit and excellent choice of decor. Cinthya and Nancy R let us check-in early to our hotel, which made our stay 100x more comfortable! We have been treated with respect and are excited to try the pool and sauna! Thanks Ladies!;5
"Susie the concierge was amazing! We wanted to find a place in Manhattan that served crab legs. It took a little while but she found it, and it you have the chance, the ""city crab shack"" on 16th and 5th is amazing!";5
Just came to London to meet up with family, see the lights and go to the theatre, so just a one night stay. Very convenient, comfortable and reasonably priced compared to our usual hotel in the Strand. Good accommodation and great breakfast.;5
My family came to visit me here in La! Jose was our server and he was so helpful and friendly. My family is a group of 8 of us, he made sure to be of service to all of us. Thank you for making my family feel welcome Jose!;5
For those familiar with singer/songwriter Joni Mitchellâs song titled âRaised on Robberyâ, then you undoubtedly know the very first line of this wonderfully melodic song is â¦âhe was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotelââ¦ Well, this is precisely the summation of my existence over the last month and may I say how superbly terrific I felt for the entire time while I revisited one of my all time favorite Manhattan hotels! As my story goes, I recently had the privilege to return for a third stay at this fantastic hotel. In all actuality, the Empire effortlessly manages to get every singular hotel detail completely right! Furthermore, this hotel has the perfect evening vibe for getting into oneâs groove by providing you with a truly soulfully designed and seductively lit;5
Best choice to either stay before or after your flight into LAX. Staff was cheerful and helpful and food was of excellent quality. The use of the hotel shuttle to our flight was excellent and ran on a 15 to 20 minute schedule. In time where the was more people than the shuttle could handle, I noticed a second shuttle arrived almost immediately.;5
I was a bit concerned before we arrived due to the very mixed reviews on here. On arrival, the atmosphere and decor inside the lobby is fantastic. Service at reception was very prompt, friendly and efficient. James upon check in was excellent. Our room was on the ninth floor, the communal hallways are quite dark due to low lighting and dark wallpaper yet perfectly clean and tidy. The room was larger than expected for central New York (a double queen bed room). It was spotless and in excellent condition. The bathroom was compact yet appeared to have been recently renovated.  The room was cleaned daily to an excellent standard. In relation to earlier reviews regarding in room coffee charges, the room is equipped with a coffee pod machine with a clear menu placed next to it which;5
Arriving after what seemed like an endless flight we had a warm welcome at this hotel, just what we needed! We were also upgraded to a lovely suite which helped us celebrate even more! We travelled to nYC for my mums 70th!  We have stayed a few times before and will again.  Excellent location, clean rooms and friendly staff! You actually canât ask for anything more in a city break hotel!;5
This is a very nice hotel  with awesome amenities and great customer service.  It is ideally located for the business traveler or the person on a vacation.  The furnishings are excellent and the customer service is exceptional.;5
The hotelâs location is fabulous for anywhere in midtownâ¦we managed to walk over 50 miles around the area from our base at The Ameritania. Itâs clean, functional with helpful, friendly, honestly staff. I realised that I had lost a diamond and sapphire earring after we checked out. Our maid handed it in to housekeeping â¦ I was delighted ð. Highly recommended;5
I loved this hotel. I loved the cosy cabin room. Its small but I thought it was great. They provide free robe and slippers to wear to the shared bathroom facilities. These facilities are very clean. Location is superb for walking or the metro. The staff helpful. And the bonus for me is a roof top bar with a great view. Will definitely stay here again if go back NYC.;5
We stayed here for a long weekend (Friday - Monday).  The location is perfect. About 1 minute walk to Madison Square Gardens and 5 minutes to Macy's and Empire State Building. Times Square is 10 mins and Central Park about 15 mins.   Really beautiful  hotel and lovely, friendly staff.  Visable security at the lifts was very reassuring, no access without showing room card first .  We had a family room with 2 double beds and although not massive it was plenty big enough.. this is New York after all.  En-suite was immaculately clean as was the room. No kettle or tea/coffee making in the room which was a shame but there are so many places to buy that it's not that much of an issue.  Would definitely stay here again without hesitation.;5
Great hotel for the price. The staff is all very kind and helpful, and manage to stay organized and pleasant despite having a constant flux of people coming in and going out. Want to mention Julian and Jeff definitely, who helped me both when I arrived with all my stuff, and helped me when I left as well. Not only that, but both were pleasant every time I saw them, and remembered me throughout the week.;5
We came early to see if our bags could be held while we explored the city. Mohammed went above and beyond!  He got us our room (a suite!) hours early and then gave our room a call once we got upstairs to make sure everything was to our liking. It is great!;5
"Iâm writing this as a mom of a young adult who found himself stranded at LAX.  I was able to call the Hyatt and was able to get a safe & cozy room for my son.  Customer service on the phone was great; he even called the property to see if my son could get an early check in (he could!).  Heâs safe for the day/night and says everyone has been so accommodating, pleasant, friendly and nice!  This is what running a business should be.  From this worried mom, thank you so much...heâs spoiled tonight at the Hyatt!  Btw, this is my second time dealing with a Hyatt when stranded and once again, we are treated like royalty!";5
Im a flight attendant with a major airline and  I stay in hotels all the time, I was so impressed with this hotel and the fantastic staff, Gisel and Michael G. I was taking my son to visit a college just down the street on Vermont ave, and Gisel was so helpful to me  the moment I booked the room , to the moment I was leaving ( I only stayed for one night)  she helped me get a taxi to the college and even extended my check out for a couple of hours until we were finished with the college tour. they went above and beyond my expectations and I would recommend this hotel to anyone reading this review, the room was so clean,  the pool area and outdoor seating area were decorated so pretty  and the breakfast was delicious and  of corse the staff was outstanding !!!;5
We recently spent one night at this property and were greatly impressed with the staff of your hotel.  We know how easy it is to make complaints but recognize that it is not often that compliments are given when things go ârightâ.  To that end, we want to share that we were most impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of each and every staff member we encountered at your hotelâ¦.from the parking valet to the front desk, to the housekeeping staff on our floor and to the security team.  It really was quite an exceptional and welcome experience.  We stay in hotels with some frequency and rarely have experienced the kind of friendliness we felt from each and every member of this hotel's staff.  We applaud them all!   I left my San Francisco 49ers hat in our room so called to;5
Hotel is in a great spot alongside Lincoln Center and many restaurants. I definitely recommend this hotel. The pool area is nice with a lot of lounge area.  Ed's Chowder House made a great frittata for breakfast.;5
This hotel is awesome. Very near to a metro station. The breakfast buffet is awesome fresh eggs, pancakes and waffles by order. The staff at the breakfast is so friendly! These guys deserve tips!!  Rooms spacious, clean and great beds. A small pool and a lovely patio.  Had to print some important stuff but the computer at the lobby wasn't working. Ladies from the frontdesk helped me with a smile!   Rate for car parking is high, 24 dollar a night plus tax..that is the only negative thing about our stay.  Will stay here again!;5
