the rooms are very clean and comfortable the price is worth the stay however the parking kills you 33 dollars a day is too much especially if you arrive late in the evening and have to check out the next day at 12;5
set next to london eye great for sightseeing and commuting 3rd stay here and definitely will be back clean and comfortable rooms and a great nights sleep handy for waterloo station but a lot of london attractions within walking distance;5
i visited nyc in april i am a female in my late 20s and was solo travelling for the first time in my life i decided to stay at the jane for a couple of days i didnt know what to expect since the reviews i had read were quite contradictory i arrived at around 12 pm and they allowed me to check in early since my room was already available the room was small indeed but it was comfortable and cozy as well shared bathrooms and showers were always clean and they only got a little crowded early in the morning i had breakfast and dinner at cafe gitane food was delicious and the staff was really nice and helpful the ballroom is a must specially if you want to meet people the janes location is great the subway is nearby and you can easily get from whatever point of;5
excellent service and courtesy from the staff they went out of their way to help us the debriefing bar at the end of the day was a highlight the decor was superb the location was unparalleled the weather was marginal lots of rain all facets of the hotel was more than worth what our price was for this stay;5
we stayed as a family of 4 for 5 nights in april the hotel is very central to everything there is a sub way station literally next to it and it is in touching distance of maddison square garden rooms were very clean and nicely decorated they were a bit on the small side but you are hardly in them i would definitely stay there again if you are only thinking about staying a few days think again we could easily filled 10 days;5
great location the staff was friendly and the rooms were very clean close to good food and all of the broadway theaters eat at the black tap amazing burgers and shakes also the buttercup bakery is amazing for anyone with a sweet tooth;5
fantastic location just off central park beautifully decorated throughout rooms very clean and comfortable the hotel staff are very very friendly and helpful the downstairs bar area is a lively buzzing area in the evenings the upstairs terrace is a fantastic viewing area to take in the atmosphere from above i can imagine the area to always be full on warm summer evenings as the sun left around 5pm during our stay i wold recommend the empire hotel to anyone planning a stay in the big apple;5
great atmosphere and staff will definitely be back the room was larger than any other iâve stayed in in nyc and i visit about 4 times a year the added security of checking room keys before guests entered the elevators was very comforting come on itâs new york;5
this is a moderately priced hotel with an elegant lobby and comfortable nicely decorated rooms its prime feature is its location immediately across the street from lincoln center and right on broadway with the subway nearby and buses across the street a 510 minute ride to times square the upper west side is lovely;5
it was a good experience in general i will book in this hotel next visit the room is clean the hotel is clean and neat the staff were very friendly buffet breakfast was good the only thing disturbed this experience was the noise from the construction they were renovating the hallways;5
we stayed in a deluxe room with king bed it was handsdown one of the most comfortable hotel beds we ever slept in the pillows were heavenly as well clean room and super friendly staff we will definitely stay at the ameritania again next time we are in nyc;5
everything about this place was great we just needed a bed to rest our weary feet at the end of the day and this place was fabulous for that the beds were comfortable and the space was just what we needed everyone that worked there was super friendly and helpful;5
my visit to the empire was inspired by its location which is extremely convenient for the arts resources of the lincoln centre and its reasonable competitive prices i was warmly received and made welcome the resources of the hotel were excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful a thoroughly satisfactory experience which i shall happily repeat if and when i am in new york again;5
we stayed in the eucalyptus room for a long weekend at the end of november 2014 the room was absolutely beautiful and had everything in it we needed including free water handy to take with you in the morning when you go exploring fruit little snacks toiletries etc the bed was probably the biggest and most comfortable bed we had ever slept in and having a turndown service made it all that more special we had the full traditional dinner in the riad on the first night we arrived which was the best meal we had the whole time we were there lovingly prepared beautifully presented and totally yummy the breakfasts were big and tasty and there was lots to choose from the location of the riad was tricky but youssef who worked for the hotel walked you to the jamaa el fna;5
i loved this trip in particular the rooms were tiny but the location of the hotel was so convenient i got to see madison square garden times square and the empire state building while my husband was in his meetings i walked around the city it was great i had lunch n dinner at the tick tock cafã© and turns out that george bush used that as a campaign headquarters i went downstairs and read up on all the great history of this beautiful hotel there were many historical points of interest i loved my trip looking forward to visiting again in the near future hopefully if all goes as planned we will be visiting again in january 2017;5
first we love this hotel for convenience friendly and helpful staff and value we had three rooms and all three were executive view queens on the 30th floor one had a view of the empire state bldg and the other two were of times squarechrysler bldg area the staff was fast and helpful at checkin they called to make sure the requested refrigerators were in the rooms and when they werent they were immediately sent yes i have stayed in larger rooms at the marriott marquis in times square but also paid higher prices the staff at the new yorker made you feel a part of it and we love the retro feel with the nice upgrades including heated bathroom tiles;5
if your room is on the small side ask to be put in a bigger room and they will accommodateour first room was rather small compared to the room we had 2 years ago they have us anther room which was fab and a bottle of champagne as it was our honeymoon ð;5
nice hotel good location very cleanbest part is breakfast sonia and her team deliver delicious food and great servicewould definitely recommendif i had to nitpick would say the hot water was in short supply but all that does is wake me up quicker;5
we enjoyed our two night stay in this hotel in july 2004 we chose this location for its proximity to universal had no problem walking to universal once we figured out the safest way to get there to avoid the very crowded streets was pleasantly surprised that we didnt hear kids running up and down the halls or doors slamming since there were obviously a lot of children in residence we stayed on the executive floor which included continental breakfast this was great as we were traveling with a child the dining room was not nearly large enough for all the guests but the staff was great about refilling food so if you time it right or are patient or give those reading a newspaper with their third cup of coffee enough dirty looks you can enjoy a great continental;5
i loved the location beds were so comfortable friendly staff and fast room service the only complaint i have is the extra hotel fee for things that should be included anyway;5
the hotel was nice and clean and fancy but the internet connection could be better the food was great but the dinner meals need to be bigger thank you for the experience of staying in a high class hotel near the airport for my trip to new york;5
my husband and i stayed at hollywood hotel four years ago we loved our stay from check in to check out we have returned agan this year it still is the same excellent stay except parking is a bit expensive;5
my sister and i spent a magical few days at riad kheirredine the riad felt like an elegant tranquil oasis amid the mystical pinkwalled winding streets of the medina of marrakech we were treated like family and looked after so warmly by all the staff everything was taken care of from booking restaurants tours of the souk and sunset camel rides as well as taxis and airport transfers we were given a local phone to allow us to contact the riad as we were out and about and sometimes lost in the maze of the souk nothing was too much trouble and all the staff had a smile on their faces when helping us or having a chat the breakfasts were also outstanding i should mention that the cocktails were excellent and being on the terrace at sunset was a sublime experience;5
this hotel is great if you want to go to universal studios but the nearby metro makes the hotel convenient for visiting sights like chinese theatre etc there are lots of good restaurants shops and bars within walking distance and the hotel staff were really helpful with directions etc all in all we had a great stay;5
if a grand five star 1920s hotel and a high end european hostel had a child this would be their offspring only deep in new york city would a concept like this ever work or be as awesome as this away from the tourist buzz in chelsea this gem is a great alternative for the experienced new york traveler lets just say upfront i am not sure if the rooms could be smaller or the experience more closterfobic in them there is nothing more new york then this the room i stayed at with a friend was a 2 bunk room more like something you would find on a ship and nothing like a hotel stay its about as small as one could get but the experience alone is wonderful in this unique little vintage gem warning to light sleepers the doors close really hard and noisy so if you are a light;5
the ameritania hotel is an excellent choice in the times square area of nyc comfortable clean well kept rooms and friendly helpful staff highly recommended to all convenient to all the major attractions in the area;5
very nice place close to empire state building across the street from penn station times square and macys we were able to hop on train and go anywhere in the city and we will definitely be back;5
if you know the area then you know prices can be high and yet the jane is super affordable and a great value i chose the jane for proximity to a friend and a theater production i intended to see i stayed in a room with a private bath so i canât address the shared bath experience but can definitely attest to the cleanliness of the bathroom in my âcaptainâs cabinâ and in addition just a very well appointed bathroom my bed was huge and comfortable the hotel staff were great especially alejandro upstairs in the bar this is not a 5 star hotel property but it is most definitely worthy of a 5 star rating for providing excellent value comfortable lodging and other guest services and a great team of people taking care of the guests;5
my husband and i spent 2 nights at riad kherridine the service we received from valentina and staff was quite possibly the best i have ever received at a hotel when asked we discovered there were 15 members of staff to 8 roomsobviously service is taken seriously as the riad is located in the middle of the medina its quite hard to find and easy to get lost we were given a phone upon arrival and we were encouraged to call at any time if we needed an escort each time we left the riad a member of staff would accompany us to ensure we got to where we needed to be during our stay all nonalcoholic drinks fruits and wifi were free of charge the staff helped us to book a cooking class and called several restaurants for us to secure dinner reservations the property;5
the hotel restaurant and bar were absolutely amazing the seafoodprime buffet is very worth it and the hotel bar was extraordinary jose and victor made delicious beverages and offered new suggestions along with great conversation;5
we cannot speak more highly about this riad and the staff if there was a sixth star i could provide here i would even before our arrival the hotel reached out to us to arrange for ground transportation from the airport we were greeted with luggage service a warm welcome and breakfast even though it was well into the afternoon the staff members were happy to guide us by foot to our various destinations and even gave us a local cell phone in case we got lost and needed their assistance to return to the hotel the staff there is incredibly accommodating they seemed to know when we had a late night the night before and would not disturb us in the morning breakfast is available anytime of the day you request and it is included the bar and really any service you require is;5

we have been at the riad for a 4night stay in march 2016 we landed at noon and were picked up by a driver organized by the riad however the riad is really beautiful and designed with an eye on each and every detail the rooms are spacious well designed and always very clean the staff was always very friendly and attentive plus location the riad is located right in the medina and most places of interest are good to reach staff very friendly attentive polite with a personal approach breakfast very tasty breakfast fresh fruits yoghurt cereals very good coffee rooftop the rooftop is beautiful great view about the medina the riad itself it is a very beautiful place very calm and relaxed minus wifi was sometimes weak however this is not really an;5

we only stayed 1 night but really enjoyed our time there the hotel has an art deco feel and reminds one of fancy balls and dinners that may have been held there the room was small but it just added to the hotels overall charm we especially liked that we could walk to dining shopping and the subway a friendly and efficient staff is always a plus and the new yorker certainly has that overall a great experience will definitely stay here again;5
my husband and i really enjoyed our stay at the hyatt regency lax it was stylish comfortable and met all our needs and made flying out in the morning so much easier our dinner at the hotel was also really terrific thanks for a terrific stay;5
myself my two sisters and my mother recently stayed at riad kheirredine for 6 nights and it was exceptional in every possible way all of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the service is faultless whenever we wanted to visit anywhere or wanted recommendations on places to visit this was organised totally hassle free by elena and her team and very reasonably priced too and whenever we did go out we always had someone to walk us to a place we knew as well as having a local phone which the riad provided incase we got lost needed some assistance etc which was very useful the facilities are brilliant lots of lovely places to eat have a drink and relax i highly recommend the riads hammam too this was brilliant and very relaxing the food is;5

you couldnt find a better location to visit universal studios we had two rooms one on the 9th floor and one on the 22nd floor both were very nice with great views only thing is that if someone has a disability you should wait for the shuttle service or call a taxi instead of trying to walk to universal city walk clean nicely maintained great beds and bedding restaurant was super expensive but had the largest buffet i have ever seen 47 per person but overall it was worth it;5
nice modern hotel walked there after dropping off rental at budget shuttle to airport important rooms are pretty cool with the grey black white decor with bright yellow accessories very comfortable bed barely hear any airport traffic the lounge was nice with lots of tvs i didnât think that the food was as overpriced as other reviews mentioned and it was good overall very comfortable my only surprise was that a guest who visited for dinner had to pay for parking 21;5
people make the difference in life especially when traveling i have been staying in nyc for years and i would recommend the empire to anyone who believes like i do that the staff make a hotel stay most enjoyable gabriel took care of our reservation with hotel manager kevin who was incredibly responsive and made us feel welcome they added a touch of hospitality by having a fruit plate and water available as we arrived late in the evening rudy checked us in with a smile and put us in a suitea great sized room for new york city we cant thank the empire team enough we will be back;5

you couldnt find a closer or better hotel near lax not a bad price for a top hotel while the front door can be a little hectic the parking crew out front has a good handle on it while you check in check in is a breeze with friendly hotel staff including bellmen when you need them you know the hyatt rooms will be immaculate with lots of white starchy linen and big comfy beds huge hdtv and a fridge maybe the best part was the lobby restaurant took us by surprise how this casual open setting would provide such delicious fooddrink i had the short rib and martini both top rate after that it was all good;5
we just got back from staying at the empire after reading some of the negative reviews we werent sure if we had made the right decision i loved this hotel staff was wonderful and check in was quick and we got our rooms right awaythe location is perfect walking distance to pretty much everything we were in room 104 no view but we were ok with that room was a pretty good size and was very clean my friends rooms were next to us and was smaller but honestly you are not in nyc to stay in your rooms my only small complaint was that they dont have a coffee maker in the room but we found a really nice deli place just around the corner and would get great breakfast sandwiches muffins yogurt fruit and coffee and go sit across the hotel where there are tables and chairs set;5
great hotel clean modern great location and great price we had a wonderful stay in nyc thanks to the empire hotel the rooms were extremely clean wonderful atmosphere in the lobby the staff were all more than helpful and very friendly;5
thank you to elena and the rest of the team at riad kheirredine an authentic relaxing and beautiful riad tucked away in a quiet area but easily accessible to most of the tourist attractions we were in classic suite jasmine which was perfect for a family because you have 2 small bedrooms and 2 bathrooms on different floors aswell as a small sitting area and balcony all furnished very tastefully and house keeping come twice a day to do a thorough job and keep everything replenished need to give a quick shout out to the laundry service and hammammassage which were excellent aside from the lovely surroundings a major plus of this riad is the fantastic customer service they genuinely want you to enjoy yourself as first time visitors to marrakech we felt safe in;5
my daughter had a 10 am curtain call at carnegie hall we decided to stay the night before for a stress free transition from sleep to performance we also booked the next night so we would have a base of operations the level of service we required was vigorous vlad checked us in with ease and panache the room was excellent we didnt need a view but we did need comfortable beds and room for our diva to get ready ameritania delivered i called for ice and extra towels and there was a knock on the door with what i asked for almost as soon as i hung upamazing i have to say the beds are out of this world vlad and elana was an amazing kind efficient team i love when a plan comes together thank you ameritania for making that happen;5
we stayed for four nights over new year and were delighted that we picked the ameritania location is superb for walking to the times square area and the theatres and the doormen were very helpful in directing us to local eateries cosmic diner for breakfast cascade for a snack our room was insidefacing which meant we had a peaceful sleep each night with the aircon being both quiet and efficient the room was very clean and the bathroom equipped with a large rainfall shower lighting was pretty subdues in the bedroom but that wasnt a problem to us the front desk as well as the doormen were so pleasant and helpful with hints about the locality and likely newyear access restrictions we found it to be good value for nyc and will recommend to friends;5

the best place to stay for universal studios wonderful hot or continental breakfast buffet which i recommend purchasing with the room type since 2 adults continental and 2 children full hot are included itâs a 60 value you can upgrade the adults to full hot buffet for 10 each convenient access to the park and universal city walk we took the complimentary shuttle to the park as it is an uphill walk and we walked back to the hotel afterward as itâs actually faster then waiting for the shuttle to come back around rooms were clean and updated and our corner king wsofa bed was roomy i recommend requesting an upper floor for the amazing views great mini vacation;5
the hotel we usually stayed at was booked so we tried this one i am glad we did the rooms were large for nyc beds were comfortable rooms were clean view was great location is convenient it is an older hotel but clean and renovated enough the italian restaurant downstairs is wonderful next time we head to nyc i will definitely be looking for a room at the new yorker there is a lot of great history on the hotel too;5

my 17yearold daughter and i a middleaged mom just spent 5 dreamlike days at this riad in the middle of the medina ie the old center city of marrakech we cannot say enough about riad kheirredine from beginning to end the staff was attentive friendly and eager to make our stay as enjoyable as possible the physical space is just gorgeous with ample cozy rooms for reading or relaxing fires crackling in the evenings and lush gardens scattered about my daughter spent a couple of hours every night on the roof under the stars lying on a pillowcovered couch on one of the many terraces while she caught up with her friends from home our room was comfortable clean stunningly appointed and had everything we needed they even did our laundry at no extra charge;5

we had a nice stay at the empire hotel its only two blocks from central park so we were able to bring the kids there daily to play its only 3 blocks from columbus circle so it was easy to travel into downtown via the subway there isnt a lot for quick lunch food nearby but there is a starbucks on the corner and a dwayne reade next to that which was convenient and theres a rooftop bar a that hole plus smiths across the road which is a nice dinner restaurant overall we were very happy with our choice;5
very decent hotel has all that is expected of a typical premier inn and of course itâs in a brilliant london central location i stayed for two nights and no complaints from me at all the noise from the hotel during the night was somewhat a disturbance but is to be expected from central london and was well muffled by closing the windows the room was clean and tidy and breakfast was well cooked and wide ranging as usual from a premier inn would return to this hotel again if ever i need to stay the night in london in the future;5
the room was big and tidy it was possible to open part of the window so the air was not as stuffy as it sometimes gets inside a big hotel the location was amazing close to the subway times square and central park yet not so close as to be chaotic outside we had a great time here a special shout out to jeff who helped with our luggage and georgina sp who took care of housekeeping;5

my son and i stayed here on a buisnessleisure trip he for a job interview and me for a business meeting we read the reviews before the trip and knew what we were getting our bathroom was across the hall and only once did one of us need to wait for the shower never for the toilet when we asked staff for another water bottle and to clean the shower floor both were done immediately the first floor cafe gitane was excellent for breakfast for tea while reading a book and for an inexpensive but very good quality dinner staff was very friendly it has an oldtime elevator that is staffed and he memorized our floor they stored our bags on the last day as we toured until late afternoon a tendollar taxi ride form the hotel in greenwich to midtown and an easy walk across;5
3rd floor queen room not good bed pillows this time otherwise good front desk service and hugo and staff at breakfast buffet are always exceptional parking charge is not rightan extra nonwarranted charge just because we can park behind an iron gate if you want me to keep writing 200 charactersdont know what else i can share;5
a very nice hotel with a perfect location nice bathrooms and very comfortable beds the room was a bit small tough but it didnt bother us much because we spent all days in the city some things in the room were quite warn out and should maybe be fixed or renewed we had a room to the street side and it was a bit noisy in the evening but in the middle of new york you cant expect anything else the staff was very friendly to us and especially gina she smiled talked and really cared about us and gave us tips on were to eat and made sure we were okey at all times thats how customer service should be like we really felt welcome at the hotel and enjoyed our stay well be back;5
my husband and i stayed here to attend a concert at the ampitheater on the property of universal studios we did take the free shuttle shuttle ends at 9 pm to universal studios but the second day walked it is a very short walk literally across the street which is great selfparking and checkin were a breeze the line for nonhilton members even though i am one was shorter and moved quicker so we chose that we were on floor 16 and had a wonderful view of universal studios the bed was so comfortable which was very nice especially after standing for many hours at the concert the elevators were a bit slow which was annoying and our faucet leaked but i rigged it with washcloths and it didnt bother us i would like to see lotion in the bathrooms instead of mouthwash;5
chose this hotel for our last night in la arrived at 1230pm and allocated a room no problem room facilities and most importantly the staff all excellent pleasant professional and always willing to go the extra mile for guests;5
the new yorker is the first hotel we have used in nyc it was recommended to us by a friend due to its location it is really close to penn station meaning train travel from the airport jfk in our case was really simple plus there was no lugging cases round the city as we were in the hotel in a matter of 2 minutes the subway is served by penn station too so really easy to navigate the city the hotel is one of the oldest in nyc but is well maintained and our room 3132 was clean and tidy as were the public areas check in was simple and quick and we were made to feel welcomed there are plenty of lifts and they are split equally to serve the bottom half of the hotel lobby to floor 20 and the top half floor 21 to floor 40 our upgraded room was cleaned on a daily basis;5

ive been to nyc several times and know from those experiences that i dont stay in the room very much so as long as i have a clean place to sleep shower and use the bathroom im fine i chose the new yorker because of its proximity to madison square garden as i was in town for the billy joel concert i brought my 71 year old mom with me for her very first visit to the big apple i mentioned that it was her first visit in my online reservation hoping that the hotel would give her some special welcome or something well they did by giving us a free room upgrade and allowing us to check in 4 hours early from the front desk to security to the bellman and everyone else involved these folks made our short stay absolutely perfect when i go back to new york i know where;5

firstly i would like to apologise because i am sure to forget at least one amazing detail of this riad secondly i must urge you to book this riad if you are looking to visit marrakech our experience went a little something like this arrival greeted by a member of staff outside of the city wall and took our luggage and guided us to the riad we were then greeted by the owner valentina who gave us an overview of things as we were served mint tea poured from a great height as it is in marrakech we have never had such a greeting by any establishment we have ever stayed at the personal touch was there from the moment we stepped into the riad we were taken to our room poivre and was hit by the smell of burning incense as we entered this is the real deal decor;5
top service from beginning to end myself and husband had stayed at the new yorker two years previous and wanted to return with our daughters the service we received was unbeatable from check in to check out john checked us in and did everything possible to ensure our stay was comfortable and memorable the maids were cheerful friendly and helpful as were all staff from the information desk a special mention to john for the transportation team who arranged our transfers to and from the airport without his service we would have been cramped in a yellow taxi instead we travelled in comfort will be returning again in two years time thank you guys for making our stay that extra little bit special;5
there are some obvious shortcomings to this hotel pretty bad elevators water is 750 in the room cmon guys is that really worth it but its more than made up for by the engaged staff and the elevators are being upgraded as i write this so they are clearly making an effort to improve the service;5

close to central park and a 20 min walk to broadway ð­ and times square friendly helpful staff room was a little on the small side but big enough for what we needed bed was huge the only complaint i would have was the extortionate prices in the bar i expect to pay a little more for the convienence of drinking in the hotel but prices nearly double in bars on times square the mini bar too was expensive other than that a great hotel perhaps ready for a love and tender care in a few areas but overall for the price location and what you get you cant go wrong we will definitely book again here for our next trip to nyc;5

i rarely stay at what i consider a nice hotel usually because im not there very long but the universal hilton really had me spinning and in a good way they made me feel vip the location is great for walking over to universal studios and the pool area ill be dreaming about for weeks to come it was a nice end to a long summer i hope to have many more experiences from the hilton from now on im hooked theyre sat night buffet was pricey but if you love seafood its the place to be make sure to check out the menu because if you dont like most of the selection its not worth it i wish i could have also tried the bruch buffet room service was great and fast;5
the empire is always my go to hotel in manhattan a fresh boutique experience great rooms ingeniously designed to seem larger even though they are typically small as in most nyc hotels the building is one of the oldest nyc original hotels artfully renovated with a rooftop bar pool with cabannas and set in the lovely lincoln ctr area just a few blocks from central park and 123 subway line cool lobby bar and hopping nightclub in rooftop bar round out the scenesome of the rooms might be noisy depending on location but this is new york not a cabin in the woods;5

this is the closest hotel to lax they are soooooo welcoming sooooo professional they are just want you want before or after a flight shuttles to the airport run every 15 minutes the windows are soundproof so you donât feel like youâre at an airport hotel high recommend if you havenât joined their loyalty program do so there is a reason why they have a great reputation experience it here;5

best lax hotel in the area in addition to being the closest one to the airport surprisingly quite rooms mostly due to the quadruple pane windows they use beds are incredibly comfortable and their food downstairs at the bar is excellent compound this with shuttles leaving every 15 minutes to the airport and there is no reason to stress about trying to catch an early morning flight just show up the night before and let the shuttle get you there in the morning;5
my family and i had planned a trip but due to covid it got cancelled however the staff at new yorker particularly neida aldama communicated with us in detail and clarified all our doubts the hotel gave us a voucher to be used since it was a nonrefundable booking and neida played a really important role in communicating between us and the hotel back and forth sheâs warm welcoming nice kind and an excellent staff and i hope to meet her whenever me and my family plan to use the voucher to stay at the new yorker;5

here on business the staff is so accommodating so genuinely nice and service oriented i appreciated seeing managers jump in and help the buffet was spotless and delicious the shuttle was so convenient we needed several different things and each need was met with grace and a true sense of helping us from using the business center to having to park in the front of the hotel due to an event it was perfectly balanced for all the business and families truly would recommend kudos the the staff who must be tired but youâd never know never saw an eye roll attitude or an appearance of stress these people deserve big kudos;5

we spent 4 nights at the riad for our honeymoon and absolutely loved every second everything in the reviews plus more is true we loved our room cannelle breakfast was delicious and i loved that i could wake up order coffee first thing and then have breakfast later pretty much anywhere we pleased we also had dinner there twice and both were made up of tasty moroccan dishes and the wine available was great the riad is about a 5 minute walk from the town and about 2030 depending how often you stop minutes from the main souk area having the phone added extra reassurance but the directions given on our first trip out with shoki apologies for the spelling meant we easily found our way back even at night the route is busy and well lit so id definitely recommend;5
elena and her staff were amazing we had an amazing stay in marrakesh the staff were so sweet and helpful we felt so pampered and spoiled the riad itself was so beautiful and staff is always keeping it tidy and clean right after a slight drizzle the maintenance crew were wiping the dust off the leaves of the trees when we arrived late at night elena welcomed us with traditional moroccan tea and cookies and even provided us with a little extra snack of tuna sandwich and pastries delish the medina and souks can get a little hectic at times but riads staff guided us around pointing out major landmarks in case we get lost getting lost is a part of the adventures but just make sure you get back before 9 or 10pm because everything around will look the same our;5

having never been to la before i was struggling to find the best place to stay knowing from talking to people that there are nice areas and not so nice areas a friend the universal city hilton due to its safe feeling environment with plenty to do in the evening without having to travel it is right on the doorstep of universal studios and universal city which sits just outside of the studios and has an abundance of shops and restaurants to keep you occupied we were here for 4 nights and spent each evening here trying out the different restaurants all of which we thought were really nice it definitely feels safe however they do stop serving food around 9ish and it does start getting quieter around this time if you wanted to stay out later than this for drinks we found one;5

my partner and i stayed at riad kheirredine for 3 nights at the end of april i had booked on the basis of the tripadvisor reviews and admittedly i was a bit sceptical about how good it sounded i need not have worried everything i had read about the riad and its staff was true they were charming helpful and went out of their way to make sure our stay was as relaxing and enjoyable as possible little touches such as giving you a mobile phone in case you get lost in the medina maps of the city and escorting you in to the central square on your first day or to the taxi or a restaurant made all the difference to the challenge of finding your way round the old part of the city by its very nature the medina is a labyrinth of streets and alleyways hot dusty and noisy;5
perfect hotel for early flights out of lax long term parking next door shuttle pick up at hotel have stayed here many times in the past always up to expectations at checkin was given an up grade without asking;5
we had such a nice experience at hilton universal city from the moment we met wendy at the counter we knew the service was going to be spectacular we were upgraded to a nice room with a view of universal studios which made for an even better stay thank you hilton for the wonderful experience;5
the staff was amazing here i enjoyed my room the view the hotel awesome discount and honestly i would return for their amazing staff i had a problem with the location of the room when i first checked in and nancy moved my room with no hesitation she put us on the 3rd floor with a city view best customer service;5
we stayed here for a week and prior to our arrival we were concerned about the location and hotel in general due to some of the bad reviews none of it turned out to be true we are 2 girls in our 20s and had no problems at all the area may look a little shady but thats just what the nontourist part of la looks like we took the subway day and evening and took cabs by night and we felt completely safe the whole time yes the hotel is a little wornout there was a few cracks in the wall but its great for the price its close to everything you wanna see staff was really helpful and facilities were clean the wifi could have been better though;5
my husband and i stayed at the new yorker because of the convenience to penn station and macys as we are volunteers for the macys thanksgiving day parade we were pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was we booked the smallest room with a queen sized bed it was small but comfortable spotlessly clean and had everything we needed the hotel staff was courteous friendly and helpful we enjoyed the tick tock diner which is located within the hotel great food and atmosphere overall we have already recommended the new yorker to friends and look forward to our next stay there;5
as a tourism professional i stay at numerous properties during the year many of the hotels i visit are highly rated and give positive customer service but none have come close to my recent experience at the hilton universal city my wife and i were attending a california travel association conference from our greeting by staff upon arrival thru our departure we were treated as special guests the property was older but you would never know it the lobby had an upscale look the rooms were great and the food was fabulous i could end my review at this point but there is so much more to say i wish i had more staff names to mention but need to share a few of the special employees and their high degree of professionalism our checkin was handled by a gentleman from egypt;5
very clean and great people as we got our rooms upgraded to an executive room with no additional charge as we only asked for view room excellent service from bell boy to front desk till we left kids just want to stay there;5
enjoyed my stay great staff love the onsite food options beautiful lobby central location easy to get transportation from building love the tik tok the tavern steak houseâfantastic shower with hot hot water and strong water pressure updated room with easy to use tv;5
we had 3 great nights at the hilton overlooking universal studios we asked for a high floor room and overlooking the theme park and we got one of two the high floor was excellent and we had views across la no need to worry about theme park views the facilities were amazing the pool room staff gym restaurants coffee shop concierge and free regular transfers to universal studios city walk were brilliant the hotel staff were excellent especially the concierge male who gave us simply excellent advice on how to make the best day out of universal studios we ended up buying the entry tickets from him and followed his advice it worked a treat the casual restaurant had a happy hour with cheap drinks and platters well worth a night there;5
love this hotel for many reasons but most importantly it is across the street from penn station and can take the train from ct to nyc and walk to the hotel very comfortable beds rooms and location at reasonable price walking distance to theatre district times square empire state building etc the ticktock diner attached to the hotel is great for breakfastlunch or late night munchies the second restaurant in the hotel is the trattoriabianca and is bit more upscale and great for happy hour drinks and appetizers and dinner the staff at the hotel is very accommodating and always very pleasant we have been upgraded a couple of times to rooms with views of the empire state building which was great i highly recommend this hotel and would remind everyone to remember;5
amazing experience staffs are very friendly initially we thought the staff is rude but later realized that very helpful and friendly thanks to krystal first time to ny subway station is only few steps away they offered us a free upgrade to a suite which was amazing beautiful view and balcony outside the 2 double bed room was little congested plenty of elevators overall very nice thanks new yorker;5
this is my third time to ny and the norm is that you pay for the location and not the size of the roomthis hotel had both its a few blocks from times square 5 minute walk and the rooms are a very pleasing size with a very decent bathroomthe hotel is spotless and decorated in a contemporary styleall the staff are very helpful and the complimentary coffee and water in the lobby during the am was a great kick start to the morninghighly recommend this hotel for location and price i would be very surprised if any person would be unhappy with this hotel;5
we stayed at the riad kheirredine for 3 nights for the bank holiday weekend in 2013 i booked this riad because i read a lot of good things about the staff and people definitely dont lie the members of staff are pure stars we got upgraded for 2 nights to a bigger room which is a lot bigger than the standard and absolutely amazing so i would say go for superior if you have a choice we stayed in the rose room for 2 nights then the sandal room for 1 night the standard room was still lovely but because it is smaller it does get a bit hot at night although there is ac so this should help if you use it i just dont like ac so didnt use it the breakfast is absolutely amazing go for full the pastries and cakes are all fresh the eggs are lovely and they give you;5
i stayed here just before xmas came to see the christmas lites the hotel was in great shape they upgraded my room to a suite big roomy and very clean good food had my breakfast in my room great service the help was very friendly and helpful to get to universal studios and city walk is just a 10 minute walk all up hill good exercise i would recommend this hotel;5
my friend and i stayed in a double room and were very pleased the staff were all very nice efficient and dedicated to the enjoyment of our stay the restaurant cafe sierra in the hotel was a little too expensive for the quality in our opinion but the location of the hotel was very close to city walk with plenty of other restaurant choices very close to the metro allowing us to explore the walk of fame and griffith observatory i would absolutely come back;5
amazing place and people entire front desk staff was friendly and welcoming pil is amazing great customer service definitely made my stay much more comfortable answered all my questions will definitely be coming back for all my la trips;5
the hotel is very close to times square and also nearby to some great restaurants with central park only a short walk away the staff were great and the hotel was clean and well presented you can hear the noise of passing traffic and numerous sirens during the night however i would say this is the case in most central locations in new york the room was spacious beds comfy and a very nice ensuite the hotel made for a great base for a weekend break and the hotel provided a driver to do airport runs 65usd to jfk which made our trip back very easy;5
can i start by expressing my sincere thanks to employee david at the checkin and checkout desk he was very calm respectful and helpful i had a terribly busy schedule during my stay and he made sure i was informed about all my options before checking out the location the lobby which is rather small but pretty impressive the room empire has all these things going for it but in the end what matters most to me on a professionally oriented trip to nyc like this is the commitment and dedication of its employees employees like david offer you the assurance that the hotel has got your back if things go wrong so that you can focus on the purpose of your trip thank you david;5
all the staff are extremely nice and helpful but i would like to specifically find out neida she helped me to get all the amenities i was looking for and once the extra mile to help me dress up the room to surprise my wife also bernice was extremely helpful and giving me clarification and making sure i got the right room and altogether piece of mind a very pleasant experience;5
we had a large room with the most amazing view of the empire state building which changed colour every night best to get a higher floor if you want views across the city the staff were very helpful with directions and ideas of what to do and the best way to get to places beautiful art deco style throughout;5
words cannot describe both the beauty of the riad and people who work there the amazing staff at the front desk help you plan a wonderful trip and provide personal service that is a luxury they even call you a taxi whenever and wherever you are you can be anywhere in the city or medina and text them with the phone they provide and within minutes you have a reputable taxi with a set price it was like having a private driver the riad and room was always spotless due to wonderful housekeeping service and the servers and staff who helped guide us were the best 5 stars are really not enough best place to stay in the medina;5
walking distance to universal and city walk very friendly staff clean room and very comfortable beds nice pool and property fantastic buffet breakfast and peetâs coffee on site great family friendly hotel;5

i cant really add anything more to my review of riad kheirredine over and above what many other reviewers have already written i travelled with my husband and 7 year old son for a 4 night break we stayed in the fleur dorange suite and the poivre room both were special in their own right but we particularly loved the former we had high expectations of the riad prior to our arrival and everything lived up to those expectations and at times more so the venue and in particular the staff their hospitality helpfulness and friendliness were second to none thank you to everybody for making our stay unforgettable i shouldnt really single anybody out but i would like to say a special thank you to elena we would love to return to riad kheirredine in the future and we;5

this is our 2nd visit to this hotel this visit was good with just a few minor complaints our upgraded room was smaller than we expected the construction made the elevators painfully slow but having staff help the elevators did help the beds were so comfortable the breakfast buffet was very good but the dinner seafood buffet was phenomenal our girls really enjoyed the pool the gym was better than we expected with modern equipment the staff was very nice and perky this hotel is right across the street from universal studios which was the purpose of our visit the bar area is nice and cozy we love this place and will return next year in october;5

we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights 2530 october and it was absolutely superb check in was straight forward and easy the lobby was beautiful and everywhere looked fresh and clean our room was perfect massive in size with 2 double beds but the most amazing part was the view we could see the entrance of universal studios and the harry potter castle only a straightforward 10 minute walk to the park the pool and jacuzzi was also clean and inviting with towels provided by the hotel i would 100 recommend this hotel and hope to return myself again soon;5

i just had one of the best customer service experiences iâve ever had anywhere i made a boneheaded mistake and booked a room for my family to visit universal studios with my reward points but i booked it for exactly one month later than i meant to we drove three hours and arrived only to realize that we didnât have a room i was fully expecting to have to pay through the nose for a lastminute room and having to fight for hours to get my reward points back instead christian a andy and kevin leapt into action they called hilton corporate on my behalf and had me a new room in record time they also went above and beyond by ensuring i wouldnât be penalized by the rate difference and even gave us some extra perks for the âinconvenienceâ even though it was was;5
we had a 3 night stay in march 2018 we arrived early and was so happy our room was ready early we booked a corner suite with a universal studio view when we walked in we all said wow what a view it was amazing so worth the bit extra for that view and at night even more magical my daughter said it was her favourite hotel we stayed in while away we had 5 hotels so hilton well done the bed was so comfortable and the room was immaculately clean the bathroom was lovely and so nice to have a shower with a good pressure shower head we had universal studios tickets and location was perfect even had a free shuttle bus which was perfect after a big day in universal i would recommend this hotel and i would suggest the universal studios view you wonât be disappointed;5
review of hilton hotel universal city los angeles i just love this hotel i first stayed there over a year ago during the covid era after my son moved close by and have been delighted each time iâve stayed there since it has consistently exceeded my expectations the rooms are beautiful and the higher floors especially have spectacular views from both the corner king and regular king rooms we have stayed in the corner king is very large with an interesting shape providing a great sense of privacy the dã©cor is elegant and classic it feels very current as if its last facelift was very recent but it was done in classic beige tones including a lovely stone marble bathroom i love the elegant wall paper and that the bathroom had a separate counter area with a;5

it can be easy to exaggerate one way or another on trip advisor but i have no qualms in saying that riad kheirredine is one of the best if not the best hotel weâve ever stayed in from the moment you arrive the staff are so welcoming warm and friendly they canât do enough for you marrakesh is an incredible buzzing city alive with intensity but sometimes often in fact you want a break from the madness and riad kheredine offers just that through a small unassuming door into a bitesize slice of paradise a shangrila hidden within the labyrinth of the mã©dina if your coming to marrakesh there canât possibly be a better place to stay iâd love to see it if there is the breakfast the cocktails the tagine everything was 1010 and the service second to none the;5

we had seen the reviews on tripadvisor and thats why we chose this riad among the thousand of other equally beautiful options for a similar price but even expecting the highest of standards because of the full 5 stars on here an outstanding achievement riad kheirredine and its staff exceeded all our expectations in every sense the staff here are the kindest most efficient cheerful people i have ever met as a guest you are treated with the utmost respect and care they will help you with whatever you need and i mean that ahead of our visit one of our flights was moved to a time that no longer worked for us and after unsuccessfully trying to reach the moroccan airline by phone for days they volunteered to go to the headquarters in person to deal with the issue;5
everything about this hotel is absolutely first class from our first contact we felt that they would do everything they could to make our stay with them perfect our room was great we had a beautiful breakfast each morning the rooftop pool and loungers were very relaxing we had delicious dinners and drinks prepared for us and the whole hotel is beautiful tranquil and spotlessly clean however what made this the best hotel weve experienced was the amazing dedication of all the staff our plans changed several times due to covid 19 but these changes were simply accommodated so before we arrived we were already impressed by their caring attitude everyone at the hotel was genuinely interested in doing whatever they could to enhance our stay they gave us great advice;5
loved my stay here easy checkinstaff is very attentive and friendly room was very clean and the bed so comfortable we really enjoyed the rooftop lounge great location will absolutely stay here on our next trip;5
overpriced but minutes from city walk which is part of universal not actual downtown city la but awesome room and view and great staff;5
iâve just come home from a stay at the new yorker and can highly recommend the location is perfect just on 8th and 34th so beside penn station train and subway station so access to all part of new york is really easy the room we booked had 2 double beds and was so spacious as soon as we entered we could smell how clean it was and the housekeeping was brilliant every day not all rooms will have an amazing view of course but ours did we could see the edge and the hudson lobby staff check for room keys before allowing anyone to pass by the main entrance so safety of guests is well considered all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful had a 24 hour diner attached which is a huge bonus all things considered we loved it;5
the empire hotel is an excellent choice when staying in manhattan great location the rooms are clean stocks everything you could possibly need and the customer service is great and speical acknowledgement for the concierge he was amazing;5
incredibly grateful to pil for attending us from check in to check out as well as the staff that supported all our demands wonderful hotel with a lot to do just a train ride away as a family we felt safe in the hotel despite the fact that there are many homeless people but it is not the fault of the hotel overall what a great experience and i cant wait to share with my family and friends;5
just back from a short break amazing location very helpful staff room bedding and towels spotlessly clean great view of the empire state building from room 2422 able to walk to most of new york attractions tick tock diner very reasonable good service good food plenty of hanging space iron and ironing board hairdryer and toiletries provided;5
we visited as a group of 2 families and had a fantastic stay at the ameritania hotel while it isnt a huge hotel we found this to be a benefit as the staff got to know their guests the rooms and the lobby were clean and modern and the showers in particular were great the only downside as with other reviews is the rooms overlooking thd street can be quite noisy however this would not put me off staying at this wonderful hotel finally a special mention for the staff i have stayed at different hotels in new york and have never come across such fabulous staff in particular the bartender and the concierge staff all go above and beyond in helping guests and make your stay special i will definitely stay at the ameritania again when we return to new york;5
we recently today came back from yet another stay at the new yorker and once again it met all expectations front desk staff was courteous thanks for the upgrade and we ended up with a room on the 30th floor though our view was mostly skyscrapers impressive in its own right the hudson river could be glimpsed between the buildings all in all a nice sight as always room was clean and comfortable and i was very glad not to have any drafty windows this time maybe theyve taken the hint from my last couple of reviews haha in any case as i said another great stay at my favorite new york hotel enjoyed seeing all the photos of the hotels history at the display on the lower level;5
i choose this hotel as it is close to airport and you generally dont have to wait too long for a shuttle catch the shuttle in the red zone on the lower level of the airport i had a nice quite corner room the room did face the runways but it is very quiet the hotel has excellent soundproofing the hotel has undergone a renovation and the rooms are tastefully done i did eat a meal in the restaurant and it was quite good and the meal was hot i have a weeks worth of work to do in the summertime and this will be my hotel of choice this globalist enjoyed the stays here;5
hotel was renovated recently and room looks nice and very clean i got a runway view room but the exterior window was not clean and i could not have a good view except for that the stay was good and breakfast buffet is very good and my check in staff at front desk is very friendly and provided excellent customer service overall iam very satisfied with my stay;5
great stay the rooms had such an old vintage ny style decor stayed for a small get away to find some artistic motivation service was top notch from front desk to housekeeping kathy at the front desk assisted me with some things to do around the city and at check in was phenomenal great custom service and very accommodating will totally stay here again;5
gorgeous views beautiful decor and a safe location in a central area convenient to all of manhattan just a block from penn station this is the perfect hotel for those arriving by train walking distance from times square broadway central park the empire state building macys greenwich village and hudson yards i had no need to spend extra money on a taxi or uber my entire trip a doorman is on hand to help with luggage and assist with valet parking or hailing a cab for those who have transportation needs within the city hotel security checked room keys for everyone going to the elevator lobby and front desk staff was attentive and professional the retro artdeco theme is interesting and fun the attached restaurants werent great with mediocre and overpriced food;5
this is the second time weve stayed at the new yorker the location is convenient to penn station and the subway the rooms are clean and we love that some rooms have two bathrooms and weve been lucky to get them the staff is great as wyndham rewards members i enjoy that we can bypass the normal checkin line mohammed was great in getting us checked in and the room we wanted we had to stop by later and he remembered us and was able to quickly help resolve my key issues;5
we consider ourselves well travelled and can honestly say riad kehirredine is the best place we have ever stayed in with regards to service and hospitality every member of the team was delightful nothing was ever too much trouble and they all went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming there are too many people to name individually but each and every one of them is a credit to the riad thank you for making our stay so very special the hawkins family from england;5
we stayed here for 4 nights it was perfect from the moment we arrived the location of the hotel is ideal for anyone new to the city or having previously experienced it only a 30 second walk from 7th avenue subway station our bags were taken to our room by a very knowledgeable bellboy who informed us of all of the essential information for our first night the room was amazing bed extremely comfortable and the bathroom was exceptional for our needs we were greeted with a smile every time we entered the hotel by the cheerful staff overall certainly worth 5 stars and when i visit again in the future i am sure to book to stay here again;5
when trying to find a hotel at very short notice for a visiting friend i happened upon the hollywood hotel pil at reception moved heaven earth to help us out nothing was too much trouble for him he offered us an excellent weekend rate my friend had such a good time here that she decided to stay an extra day once again pil was able to accommodate her in the same room her room was magnificent spacious with a fridge microwave a safe she said that the breakfast was excellent especially the omelettes we visited her at the hotel were very impressed with everything we saw all the staff we met were very friendly especially pil whose customer service was second to none;5
excellent clean hotel with a lovely room with a fantastic view of the city ideal location for getting around the city of manhattan excellent customer service from all the staff great priceand i would most defiantly recommend this hotel to friends and family;5
i heard some negative things about this property and i canât figure out why everything was so nice and so clean and everyone was so friendly and helpful check in was a breeze and their club level is amazing;5
ive been dreaming of traveling to marrakech for well over a decade and staying at riad kheirredine last week exceeded all of my expectations my fiance and i visited to celebrate our engagement valentina and i corresponded by email and in her rapid and attentive correspondence she promised that every minute at the riad would be a celebration valentina mme marina and the entire riad kheirredine staff kept that promise a thousandfold from the moment we walked in we were in awe of the beautiful oasis white tiles sparkling pool incredible fruits and flowers and tranquility the location is ideal as it is close to djema al fna and the souks but far enough away about 1015 mins walk to feel away from the rush every morning an outstanding breakfast is served;5
stayed here for 6 nights great location in la as it is close to the highway and can get anywhere also as the name suggests it is across from universal studios and citywalk which are great attractions for me universal studios is a one day affair and the rest of the time should be spent seeing everything los angeles has to offer a recommendation is going to malibu because it is absolutely beautiful driving through the canyon to malibu is also a great experience the concierge is beyond great as they are so helpful to get anywhere you need to go the staff were all friendly and attended to all concerns although one person at the front desk was not so pleasant the restaurant was good the pool was also nice had an executive room on the 19th floor facing the studios as well;5
travelling around rural victoria with three other couples our dinner at the empire was an outstanding start with some of our group subject to dietary restrictions i was amazed at how seamlessly and professionally the front of house team works with the kitchen to ensure we all had a fantastic evening glorious sweet chilly prawns and confit duck were my stand outs scott and the team do an amazing job thanks ð;5
my first stay in new york on business so i was very pleased to meet the friendly helpful staff at check in majid on reception was very helpful in sorting out a superb room for me and checking later on in the week if all was good which it was the room was modern clean quiet and the bed very comfortable although i was not tempted by the breakfast on offer i did occasionally sit down in the breakfast area for a coffee in the morning whilst planning my day;5
the design of the hotel is very beautiful the pool deck was very relaxing and had an excellent view the service was fast and friendly overall the experience was a pleasure i would highly recommend this hotel;5
my wife and l stayed here for 4 days great hotel we were upgraded to a doudle room which was superb staff and service great la is expensive and the hotel knows how to charge for meals etc very expensive but good food you pay for parking also around â£4000 per night plus tax so can work out expensive over a number of days location superb in my option you are next to universal but for most places you need to drive getting around we found easy although traffic heavy overall great place to stay;5
duke was a great manager he was very helpful and always willing to improve the room was very comfortable the hotel was in an excellent location cleaning does need improvement in the rooms though;5
the location is perfect for shopping and across the street from madison square gardens our suite was very clean comfortable and quite spacious we all enjoyed the lovely lounge and the tic tock for anytime dinning was superb the staff were super friendly and very accommodating we checked in a few hours early and planned to check our bags as we have done for many years at hotels all over the city and were very disappointed to be charged 5 for each bag never had this been an issue until now but someone was nice enough to tell us we could pay extra for an early check in that was must less expensive as checking all of our bags we had a wonderful experience and are looking forward to our next stay at the new yorker a wyndham hotel;5
stayed here one night and the service was excellent shuttle to universal was awesome enjoyed pool in evening and it was gorgeous didnât try breakfast but iâm sure it was great just felt it was a little overpriced overall a great stay;5
one of my relatives had contracted covid and was staying in a near by hospital the hollywood hotel was a great place to stay since it was only 5 minutes away from kaiser pil was such a great person to meet at the front desk because of how genuine he was he truly cares about the guests he serves and goes the extra mile for them to meet needsaccommodations would definitely come back;5
everything worked gerat the room needs a little refreshment but it is very clean and safe location is perfect for sightseeing hoping etc hells kitchen in walking distance mmhhhhhh we had really a great time and very quiet sleep;5
enjoyed the stay at this modern well located city hotel good comfortable beds well appointed plenty of good restaurants and bars within walking distance would recommend this hotel to others and would stay again its expensive but then again it is new york;5
the riad is beautifully decorated amazing roof terrace with daybeds where you can see right across the medina and get a great feel for local life its reached through a maze of little backstreets but there is someone from the riad to greet you and take you there and then everything is explained and you have as well a mobile phone from the riad when you go outwe were not lost once the service is outstanding amazing food and every wish is catered for the staff really go out of their way to make you at home and really take care of you during your stay we went for a day trip to the atlas muontains ouirika valley defintely worth a day trip if you are based in marrakesh i would definitely recommend this riad really a jewel of a place to stayif we would come again we;5

this hotel is excellent staff are great room is very clean i will stay at this hotel again when i come to los angles walking distance to universal studio i would recommend this hotel if you visit universal studio;5
possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed in the staff are really helpful upon arrival and throughout the stay offering to print us maps or directions to get to places and also offering advice on best places to buy things such as a suitcase as ours was broken from the airline we paid a bit extra and had the junior suite we booked it with expedia and when you book for more than 5 nights they give you 50 off the full stay we were able to pay extra 80 dollars to stay in the hotel until 2pm on our last day you were able to stay later than this but there was more of a charge there was a jacuzzi in our room which was bigger than it looks in the photos and lovely to have in the morningevening the room was huge the only problem we seemed to have was with the fridge the top;5
we had the opportunity to share a magnificent city with our children for a week we couldnât have picked a better place to call home during our visit like nyc this hotel provides rich history take a quick stroll down the escalator if you can appreciate how old these buildings are in nyc then you will love this place the lobby is clean and bright the staff is warm inviting and friendly they were very welcoming to our children also we had a two room suite with two beds and a pull out couch our room was clean and recently updated there were two walk in closets i used one as my dressing room i have three boys and this gave me great privacy there was a fridge and my favorite a coffee maker when we ran out of coffee pods and needed extra towels staff promptly;5
iâve travelled a lot in my life so it is no exaggeration when i say this is by far one of the best hotels iâve ever stayed in even before we arrived they were so attentive making sure we had a car to pick us up from the airport once we arrived we were blown away by the amount of detail and attention they put into all their guests breakfast was always very delicious a special thanks to yassine for being such a great waiter our room was always tidied up nicely and all the staff were so incredibly welcoming and friendly as two young women who were travelling we were a bit nervous arriving in an unfamiliar country but everyone at the hotel instantly made us feel safe and reassured suffice to say that i will 100 be back to marrakech and back to riad kheirredine thank;5
when looking for a hotel near central park we stumbled upon the empire i couldnt believe that such a design orientated boutique hotel could be a similar price to bland huge corporate hotel like the new yorker the decor was fabulous the food great and unlike many other trendy hotels in the city like the hudson it had doormen outside so that it felt safe and unthreatening and there were no beggars on the doorstep the price reflects some problems the hotel experiences like slow lifts and when we were there the hot water was off for a whilebut they compensated with things like free wifi in the rooms i think many of the more negative reviews of the hotel are not actually seeing the wood for the trees if you want an ordinary experience go to an ordinary hotel the;5
i was excited to stay in a room with a view but i would only pay extra for that again because the room is larger but not for the view the windows do not face the fountain the internet is the room is great when i needed to print a page not so good i skipped the print because as i understood i had to pay a minimum of 5 to get online and the pay to print i went somewhere else to accomplish that task this hotel is a short distance from columbus circle subway station very convenient overall great place for a leisure trip;5
its really surprise me that people think this hotel is dirty and unfriendly we stayed this hotel for 3 weeks and we really got great time there the staffs there are really nice and like patrick he asked me hows everything could i got anything for you i can feel i was staying in a happy comfortable and warm environment there was a man clean the kitchen every morningevery morning i just tried to prepare our breakfast and he also clean the bathroom also theres a lady clean our room every one or two day if we need towels cups hairdryer matcheswe just went to the counter in first floor and we would get everything we need therere some crazy people next to useg smash the door drunk people and fight and we just need to call the counter and we would get;5
went to riad kheirredine to celebrate silver wedding with family best experience for hols staff could not of been more helpful from getting picked up from airport to leaving rooms are lovely and very clean and comfortablefruit left in room everyday for you and also left on all tables for you to eat when ever you want any will be going back when we can so quiet and peaceful but if you need anything the staff will get it for you keep up the good work valantina and the rest of the staff;5

we took the train to new york city for a quick overnight trip i was surprised how close to penn station the hotel is no uber thank you we were checked in very quickly by mohammad sp and enjoyed chatting with him during the process the room was lovely with a view of the river the two queen beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was cool in its deco way although door exit door bathroom and door closet threw me off a little when finding the bathroom in the middle of the night wed stay here again based on how well we were treated when we arrived we really enjoyed our short stay;5
i stayed at the jane for 10 days for the price you pay in nyc it was actually pretty good rooms are clean always tidy at the end of the day clean toilets and always available for use the service was very good friendly staff including a portuguesespeaking and available the room is small but ideal for 1 or 2 people should go more than that better to book the captains cabin as i was on the 5th floor i was not bothered by noise or nennhum insect at check out there ujm problem in recovery but that was promptly resolved by the responsible person at the reception almost every day there some kind of exclusive party but the noise does not reach the fifth floor so ask for an upper chamber and the window does not stay on the road side you are not a beautiful view of;5

victor at the lobby bar was excellent made our stay extra special he crafted perfect cocktails and made quality food recommendations it is important to us that the staff at our lodging choices provide a welcoming and supportive environment he was all that more;5
super close to lax airport clean room with a comfortable bed and my shower i would definitely stay here again for the convenience of the location the only problem we encountered was the free wifi the signal was super weak and hard to get online free parking was a huge advantage;5
as i travel all over the world for work what ive found is so often the staff ether make or break a hotel my experience here this week is that the staff couldnt have been more helpful we are an event company and brought a number of athletes to the property and the staff was great secuirty is always a big issue for us this hotel has a very good security presence and i for one always feel a lot safer when thats the case i also had a small issue with room not the hotels fault at all and the manager contacted me and went well beyond what i expected to resolve myself our staff and our athletes all enjoyed the wyndham;5
universal studioscity walk is a short walk but theres a shuttle that runs every 1520 minutes our king bed was comfortable and our room was spacious the pool area was beautiful including a bar hot tub and familysize cabanas you could rent for the day the breakfast buffet was excellent hubby liked to upgrade to the full buffet including hot itemsomelets cooked to order but i was more than satisfied with the executive offerings the staff was attentive yolanda in particular when we had a problem our ac she didnt call back in 3 minutes as promised she showed up at our door with an engineer and a fan just to be proactive the issue was solved in less than 10 minutes but hubby still made use of that fan for the rest of our stay;5

my fav hotel in nyc especially for events at msg will make reservations again soon no negatives at all welcoming lobby excellent staff awesome location we make our go to hotel anytime staying in nyc;5
normally an airport hotel is prepared to provide passengers with good rest between flights right well the hyatt regency at lax international airport is way much more than this great lobby excellent bar varied choice of places to eat remarkable customer oriented staff concierge joy highlighting advice pay a little extra to access the club in addition to a convenient room you get meals drinks to go etc 247;5
was so impressed by how thorough and thoughtful this team was to make sure we had a great stressfree experience the road is stunning and the hospitality and service are second to none staying here made our marrakech experience wonderful;5
best location for universal studios we had a corner room with sofa bed comfy for our family of 4 the view was amazing over looking universal the hotel offer a free shuttle every 15 mins to universal or its only a 10min walk across the bridge;5
what a wonderful welcome to the usual cookie cutter hustle and bustle of most other lax hotels the airport shuttle service is frequent and dependable unlike many other lax hotels the hotel is the closest to the airport the recent remodel is over the top spectacular spacious quiet comfortable modern rooms and baths with all the usual hyatt regency amenities you have come to expect very good restaurant and dining options that offer creative choices throughout the day and night extensive snack options 247 just off the lobby inviting modern and hip cocktail loungebar outstanding management and staff in all hotel service areas everyone is well trained and eager to please the guest highly recommended;5

great place to stay when visiting universal studios very friendly staff and clean establishment walking distance from the theme park so you can go back and fourth over 20 floors so you can get a great view of park from your room;5
so glad we stayed at the new yorker hotel we booked as a package with virgin holidays the hotel has a lovely feel about it and the staff were so friendly and welcoming the room was immaculately clean and there was no noise from the hotel or other guest which made for a good nightâs sleep along with very comfy beds the room was a good size serviced every day to an excellent standard great shower free wifi tv hairdryer dressing table plenty of storage space the alarm clock between the beds even had usb charging points we couldnât have picked a better hotel the location was perfect so central we could easily walk to many attractions some of the highlights were madame tussauds circle line night cruise times square water taxi day cruise big bus tour;5
overall excellent experience convenient location shuttle was easy to find and access staff was pleasant and helpful the room was a great size and the beds were extremely comfortable you are right across the street from the runway and apart from the occasional dull engine roar you would never know food options if staying more than one night may get boring but this was excellent for our needs a close hotel after a late arrival;5
our family of 11 members stayed for 2 nights in 3 rooms we were welcomed by ariel larios at check in he was very professional and provided the best customer service and upgrade me and my husband to a wonderful suite which we enjoyed very much we ordered room service and we all enjoyed the dinner together in our private suite dining room thank you so much ariel we are definitely coming back due to your high standards of customer service;5

ive been to the empire hotel many times primarily for the location to lincoln center and great restaurants this time what exceeds that was the staff there luis at the front desk welcomed us like a friend he was professional yet personable when my hubby and i return in december ill be sure to seek him out;5
my two best friends and i were visiting from chicago and we decided we would stay at the worldknown chuck bass hotel to our surprise it was so much more than that on our first day there we met two of the bestmost friendlymost accomidating staff members i think if i remember correctly there names were joey and gabriel they were the main reason why i would come back to this hotel in the future they showed the best customer service imaginable and made me really feel the new york welcome i highly reccomend eatingstayingvisiting the empire hoteldont forget to ask for joey and gabriel;5

hilton is an amazing chain however we decided to try one of their amazing suits for 6 people and oh man just unbelievable and the highlight of it all was ms pamela down at the front desk shes caring sweet nice and shes very professional shout out to pamela at the front desk;5
loved our stay here wold recommend this hilton as they treated us like royalty they could not do enough for us beds were great rooms clean and breakfast superb the views from here are stunning we got some lovely photos;5
my sister and i stayed here in the middle of february the hotel has a fantastic location for exploring all boroughs of new york really close to subway stations and very easy to navigate around the staff were helpful and not overbearing there was no expectation from them for us to leave tips every time they held the door etc the room was compact but more than big enough for two of us the only complaint we had was that it was so dark in the room even with all of the lights on it seemed like dusk there was a charge for using the wifi in your room but we didnt mind not having this and it was free for all in the lobby overall a fantastic stay incredibly reasonable nice room and helpful staff would definitely recommend it to friends and would come again;5
excellent stay staff was very accommodating to westminster attendees great location and wonderful accomodations pricey parkingbut thats nyc clean rooms comfortable beds and pillows helpful staff and great housekeeping;5

hollywood premier healthcare center employee this hotel is highly recommended pil is so kind and polite everytime he saw me he will greet me and whenever theres a problem with my room he will fix it right away he cares all of his guest just like family;5
i have stayed at this hotel for 5 consequent years and in october 2020 it was going to be my 6th unfortunately due to covid i had to cancel my booking placed in january the staff was very kind as usual and i was granted the refund i always book the deluxe room with king size bed since this kind of room is bigger and more comfortable nys hotels rooms are always very small this is something known but if you take a deluxe room it is really much better as written in the past the position is great very closed to times square and all main attractions included the metro stop;5
this riad gives you the perfect opportunity to calm down after a few hours walking through the souks and streets of marrakech you will love it â as we did;5
i had no idea where to stay on a work trip to la a colleague was starting at the sheraton next door but i opted for the hilton it was great got a nice upgraded room with a great view of the park i ordered room service and it was tasty but expensive as usual the pool area is nice and the only complaint i have is that there is really nothing nice to go walk or run i stopped around city walk but i find those places sorta depressing overpriced pseudo interesting restaurants like margaritaville anyway the hilton was great bed was super comfy air conditioning worked great nice bathroom etc;5
in my opinion one of the best hotels in the city location is perfect entire staff is perfect room is very comfortable i love this hotel always consistent with service value and welcoming feeling;5
we have a reservation for the new yorker on 662019 we are arriving very early in the morning as that is the best flight we could get that fit our schedule i called the hotel in advance to ask about early check in if possible let me tell youi got the nicest most helpful person it was such a pleasure naida was her name and not only did she help with my question about early arrival and possibly helping us check in early she also helped me with questions about sightseeing and places we should not miss my husband has never been to new york and is very excited but we only have 3 days so i want to make the most of our time naida was sooooo helpful and friendly if this is any indication of the other staff at the new yorker and how they run their hotel i am sure;5

we were a little nervous about staying at a riad as we normally stay at hotels however even before we got there valentina and the team demonstrated that nothing would be too much trouble for them as they responded to countless emails on arranging a surprise breakfast for my wife the arrival was smooth with the driver waiting with a clear sign after the short drive we were met by the riad security team to be escorted in the five minute walk through the winding medina streets they are easy to navigate and the locals are friendly we entered an oasis of perfume landscaped terrace and delicious traditional food being vegetarian was no issue when we made it to our room jasmine suite we knew we had lucked out we felt like we had been taken back centuries into;5

great lobby pool pool bar gym highspeed elevator we stayed two nights and used the valet quite a bit with no attitude from staff nothing but friendliness room was oddshaped and had some odd holdovers from the 80s like a corded phone next to the toilet how was that ever a thing but was overall comfortable and wellappointed;5
w stay at this hotel because of its location it has the city walk and universal studios within steps so you have day life and night life without having to get in your car and drive the hotel itself is very nice it has a nice giftshop with the unique items that i like to buy because nobody else has one the restaurant has good food although we usually only have 1 meal there because we like to go over to city walk to people watch and eat there the bar is great ezra the bartender is fabulous he offers great service and great jokes he knows how to keep the party going among a group of strangers he is definitely a people person the bar also has a menu of its own touristy downtown hollywood is a very short drive there is plenty to do when staying at this;5

i stayed at the hollywood hotel for 5 days after travelling the us for nearly a month what separates the hollywood hotel from all the other hotels i stayed at was definitely the customer service most notably from cecille not only was the service from cecille very personalised it was also genuine and demonstrated her sincerest desire that my boyfriend and i have the most pleasant stay at the hotel as it was our final leg of our holiday we first thought that we would not be able to maximize our time spent in la because our lack of research on the area however after a brief chat with cecille upon checking in she instantaneously opted to help us organise all the sights and scenes the area has to offer she gave us maps genuine advice and all the help we needed leaving us;5

i am writing this to set the record straight you dont need me to tell you that this is one of the cheapest places in manhattan almost amazingly so because its on the elegant upper west side just a few blocks from st john of god you probably also dont need me to tell you that in the past it got some pretty terrible reviews which are still coming back to haunt it because things that people write in 2007 or 2008 seem to stay permanently and rise to the top of the google page when you type in the name of the hotel we looked at those after we had booked and of course had second thoughts about the whole thing who wouldnt maybe thats why its still so cheap because a lot of people might be turned off by a negative appraisal and not even notice that it was written;5

i recently stayed at the empire with my ten year old son and couldnt be happier with the hotel and staff i was upgraded to a suite at checkin and and was so impressed with the room it was huge especially by new york standards well appointed immaculate and half the price of other hotels of the same caliber the complimentary toiletries were by loccitane and the wonderful amenities included a 42 flat screen tv umbrellas and sumptuous robes to use during our stay and a wellstocked refrigerator and snack bar thank goodness my son didnt notice the fridge until we were leaving or he could have easily incurred another 100 or so to my tab in snacks and sodas the hotel was so quiet it seemed as though we were the only guests on the floor and the drapes used in the;5

great location spacious and friendly staff the roof top bar rocks especially with monday night jazz if you are looking to stay on the midupper west side then the empire is a great choice love the funky decor easy access to great food shopping as well as right across the street from lincoln center and one block from central park the only negative was that its an old historic building although updated with modern convenience but apparently they turned the heat up for the buidling and it was difficult to control in the room which made it very toasty fortunately we were able to open the windows which made it more comfortable;5
this hotel is in a prime location when visiting new york just a couple of blocks from the empire state building macys and times square our room was small but perfectly adequate and suited our needs as we were rarely in it the hotel staff were friendly and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel when checking out to make the most of our last day in the city would definitely stay here again;5

from the moment we pulled up outside until we left to continue our travels this hotel was perfect very friendly staff and when we checked in we were given the option to upgrade our room for an extra 20 a night we were very happy to do so and we got a cracking corner room overlooking universal studios the room we got was fantastic the buffet breakfast was one of the best we experienced on our travels of the west coast and the hotel is a 5 10 mins walk to universal studios and the citywalk for restaurants the hotel also provides a free shuttle to these areas all day but the walk is nice after a big meal cant recommend this hotel enough;5
when you first approach the riad through marrakeshs narrow alley ways you cannot comprehend just how wonderful the riad is actually going to be it cannot be faulted it is stunning and the staff are amazing we loved the wonderful rooftop terrace where you can have breakfast or return in the latter part of the day and sit and watch the sun go down with a glass of wine had it not been winter im sure that we would have taken advantage of the pools as others have said the little touches like free room service of teas and coffees and the free mobile phone and the escort service when you want to go out just make the trip complete nothing is too much for them the food is excellent do eat in at least one night we got quotes for a day trip to go skiing and to visit the;5

the hollywood hotel is an older property that is kept up very well the rooms are very comfortable and clean the beds are outstanding in my opinion the staff is very helpful and friendly the one thing that makes this a great value as well is their breakfast service eggs cooked to order including omelets in a great location with little travel to many of los angeles attractions the only downside was the checkin process was somewhat lengthy due to having to read and agree to an electronically presented agreement which is something i have never seen at any other hotel property i have stayed at;5

this is the most fantastic place to stay while in ny the building is incredible centrally located for access to all tourist hot spots and it oozes art deco design and charm from its every pore the standard rooms are clean basic and a little on the small side but what do you expect for a mid town hotel enough room for 2 the staff are incrediblyfriendky and helpful especially the wonderful samira on the front deskwho assisted in sorting out a booking error made by my travel company when they had left me stranded this woman was an angel and is a true asset to the hotel staff turning a disaster into a great stay this was my second stay at the wyndham new yorker and i hope it wonât be my last why would anyone stay anywhere else;5

nice hotel single glazing so really cold at night even with the heat set at 25â° maybe extra blankets in the winter months is an idea our room was extremely large in size it could easily fit 3 double beds with room to spare 40m2 our ooms in the past in different hotels were around 12m2 the meal deal option made our trip budget friendly location is awesome right behind the london eye 5 minute walk across the thames to several theatres big ben and the houses of parliament also a 5 minute walk extremely close to the tube waterloo would book again;5
i opted to host a loved ones surprise engagement party here and it was the best decision i ever made tyler and michael from the empire hotel staff were so accommodating and incredibly helpful in catering to our needs and helping everything run smoothly we had the party on a crisp may evening but with the option of having the party in the enclosed pool deck we got to still witness the glitz glam and magic of the city without losing the view or having to brave the cold the food was great came out warm displayed boardroom style and drinks were strong the bartenders were incredibly gracious and friendly the music was not so loud that it overpowered casual conversation but it was loud enough to give the party a lively pulse i would most definitely go back and host;5
rooms were very small but neat and clean bathroom was almost as big as the room with a tub it was off the beaten track but wed stay there again it was quiet and convenient to subway and only about 15 to 20 minutes from times square and rest of the hubbub cab was 12 to times square if you dont mind walking a few blocks breakfast was excellent where the staff suggested staff helpful not fancy but you get what you pay for this is a moderate hotel so if youre looking for fancy this aint the place if youre looking for a clean room and are on a budget or just dont want to spend money on a hotel room this is an excellent choice;5

iâve marked that i was here in feb of this year when in actual fact it was feb of last year i just havenât gotten round to leaving a review until now i absolutely loved the wyndham new yorker hotel itâs cleanliness and old fashioned decor is out of this world itâs location is super central in midtown manhattan just a stones throw away from madison square garden the location is also near to times square empire state building etc but still feels far enough away from the hustle and bustle of it all the tick tock diner as well is fab for breakfast never tried it at any other time throughout the day and reasonably priced i would recommend this hotel over and over again so much so that i am bringing my mum to new york for her first ever visit for her 60th in october and we;5
i stayed at the hollywood hotel for one night i had a room with a queen bed that i found to be quite comfortable all the sheets and towels looked clean the room was a good size although the set up was a little odd there was a big pillar at the foot of the bed there was a small couch along with a deessser a small coffee machine was provided as well there was a small desk with a comfy chair to work on and a flat screen over the desk that had a keyboard i know you could purchase wifi and use it on the flat screen i opted out of wifi the bathroom was very clean it had a blowdryer and plenty of toiletries the closet had enough space for a few outfits i put away and an ironing board with iron was available not much of a view small pool view but views was not a priority;5
good location very close to subway station many restaurantsshopsdrug stores within walking distance room was clean no roaches bugs or anything like that yes the room was small but that shouldnt matter if youre actually out seeing new york perfect room to take a shower in and sleep in elevator was small and really slow which was annoying but id rather pay the low price than have a spacious super speed elevator in a more expensive hotel walking distance to central park metropolitan museum of art guggenheim museum and many other attractions statue of libertyellis island is one quick subway ride away staff was okay check in lady carried on a phone conversation while she checked me in and they wouldnt call me a cab when leaving told me to go outside and;5

stuck at lax due to the security controls trashing 3 hours missed onwards flight went to hyatt recency and miss megan was absolutely wonderful a total pleasure to deal with and could not do enough she deserves employee of the month and year;5
of the many hotels at lax weâve stayed in this one has done by far the best job renovating one of those typical old airport hotels we originally were assigned a âcity viewâ read parking lot view only but after asking politely at check in the front desk guy went out of his way to shuffle rooms around in order to upgrade us to a suite thanks to our globalist status with hyatt we ended up with a wonderful big suite with perfect runway views which was quite impressive we found the room to have nice modern decor a comfortable bed and a rather nice walkin shower the pool is in the midst of parking garages and you actually hear the airplane engines roaring in the background but we strangely liked the pool area regardless and appreciated how deep the pool was something;5
we spent three nights at the riad at the recommendation of a friend who said it was the best experience he ever had at a hotel i agree i was there with my two adult childern and we stayed in the verveine room we used the riad as the base for daily activites always looking forward to returning to relax in the later afternoon before heading out for the evening the riad is in the older part of marrakesh so read up on what that means as everyone has said in reviews the staff is truely the best elena helped overcomes several booking mistakes on activites that i had made and provided excellent alternatives while the meals are great at the riad they also provided several excellet places in town as well if you go please do not hesitate to ask quesitons or present;5
loved this hotel excellent location went to watch the basketball at madison square gardens which was literally across the road as was penn street station ended up taking the train back to the airport because it was so conveniently placed we had a twin room and it was a good size although dark because we were directly facing another block but not really an issue despite it being minus 15 overnight room was warm and the temperature was easily controllable from a panel in the room easy access to large variety of food places and we particularly enjoyed the italian in the hotel was also across the road from a cvs so easy to stock up on snacks and drinks staff all lovely and helpful and everything lovely and clean with lots of history;5

read the reviews on trip advisor and decided on this riad and we could not have been more pleased i like to think of myself as a well travelled individual but i will add the level of customer service here is second to none in that the staff cannot do enough for you and nothing is too much trouble we ate in the hotel on the first night and sat by the lovely log fire as the evenings are cool in february the second we ventured into the new town to amaia which was excellent and the third to al bareka which is just off the main square traditional and fine given its location the hotel arranged a guide for us on the first day which was useful as the medina is easy to get lost in on the other days we went to jardin majorelle tip is to get there by 9am to avoid the queues;5

ok so letâs get the elephant in the cabin rooms out of the way yes they are small but that and the associated price point is the whole point of the place if you donât like the idea of an 8x4 room with a single bed this is not for you the rooms themselves are beautifully designed based on a shipâs cabin and finished to a high standard thereâs loads of storage and hanging rails and contrary to other reviews they do have air con which does make a sound but itâs far from the worst iâve heard in america be advised the place currently remains one of nyâs busiest late night drinks destinations and the roof top bar and ballroom on ground floor do bounce at weekends so ask for a middle floor to avoid the inevitable noise and earthshattering bass the toilets;5
brilliant hotel staff are all good request something and they try to help old but brilliant some rooms are small but hey not an issue we had 2 rooms start of holiday and a special 1 at the end when we returned wow only thing jack hammer on building opposite going all night but its part of the new york experience oldy world hotel cant knock it thank you to everyone who made it a special holiday;5

the hotel is located right across the street from the lincoln center the subway station is at the center so it is so convenient the rooms were a decent size the only complaints were that the ac wasnt that strong so it was hot and stuffy in the room we had a low floor so the road noise was pretty loud id stay there again but i would request a room on a higher floor;5

this is an amazing riad absolutely beautiful we were completely blown away by the service and the ambiance of this riad the attention to detail is amazing i can not say enough about the staff yes it is a little far from the hub of the city but we thought that only enhanced its appeal to us however there are a few glitches one was in our room we had a junior suite it was more junior than suite and not worth the additional cost over the deluxe room i wish i had paid better attention to the pictures on their website then i would have realized how narrow the space was and how little room there was to store anything the seating area was a joke and two people could not be in the bathroom at the same time luckily the common area was fantastic and we only used our room;5
had an amazing stay jeff was very helpful he helped with our bags and provided all the information we needed to know about our stay even willing to help us coordinate transportation will return again;5

this is an old hotel with a number of updates over the years it is extremely presentable with helpful staff clean rooms and reasonable rates the rooms can be small and the hotel is older that can contribute to the charm of the stay this real estate has seen a lot of people come and go over the years the location to get to shopping tourist attractions transportation and restaurants is so convenient;5
we stayed here based on the positive ta reviews as well as its great location it was right across from lincoln center and a few blocks away from the fordham campus we arrived much earlier than check in because my son had to attend class early and the staff was great about calling my cell as soon as our room was ready my very old cell phone had trouble connecting to the complimentary hotel wifi i was quickly put in touch with their it communications team who were immediately able to help me to connect i was truly grateful for that there are great croissant shops and bakeries nearby to grab breakfast the rooftop pool here was an amazing addition to our new york experience the pool was spotless every member of the hotel staff was helpful and attentive the front desk;5

our family of 5 arrived in marrakech at the tail end of a month âroad tripâ through spain portugal and morocco from the moment we arrived at the riad after a long day of travel we were treated by elena and the rest of the staff there as if we were family the riad is a slice of heaven nestled in a medina that is exciting exotic and fun but can also be overwhelming and tiring as well particularly for the kids the riad itself is beautiful and very charming as can be seen in the pictures and is even more impressive in person the wonderful pools the numerous areas to retreat and relax especially on the expansive rooftop with a book or a glass of wine or to watch the world cup as we did on several occasions with fellow guests however it was the staff and;5
we have stayed in many hotels across the world and we can honestly say we have never stayed at a place with better service than the staff at riad kheirredine is providing the friendly staff is taking care of you letâs you enjoy all the best marrakesh has to offer without having to worry about anything everyone at riad kheirredine makes you feel special and wants to make sure that you can relax delicious breakfast in the lounge areas on the rooftop unlimited fresh orange juice fruits and water excellent moroccan diner are just some of the highlights what really sticks out is that you receive a phone upon arrival to use during your stay through which you can ask the staff just about anything to arrange for you as if you have a personal assistant taking care of you;5
my family visited the riad in 2014 the staff will treat you like a king the service the atmosphere and the food are just spectacular there will be fresh fruit and tea ready when you come back everybody was very helpful with our questions about the city and the surroundings and they helped us arrange a few trips desert tanneries;5
this is in a great location you can walk to almost everything we walked there from penn station and that was a little long but the subway is right there so you would not have to if you dont want to grant park is very close and we rode bikes all through the park the staff is friendly and it is right next door to the theatre where they film the tonight show with stephen colbert my room was big for new york standards it was all pleasant;5
great location close to penn station macys and many more for art deco lovers bathrooms not too large old style but charming perfect of you want to visit newyork and you might have a great view on the empire state building and chrysler building;5
we stayed for 5 days at this riad and it truly exceeded our expectations from the moment we stepped in to the riad we were pampered the riad is beautiful with large banana trees in the court yard a beautiful terrace with a lovely pool but what makes this riad is the team they have there i may forget some names but illyas yasine hassan hamza ibrahim the girls on the front desk were super amazing they made us feel welcome and at home and i truly wouldnt stay anywhere else if i came back to marrakech additionally the food is spectacular the tagine the chef makes is out of this world we seriously couldnt find anything that matched it outside at some very nice restaurants thanks for the beautiful stay and we look forward to coming again;5

my partner and i initially dreaded staying there because of the neighbourhood but because we arrived late at night it appeared more scary than it was had a small issue with someone one night when i was outside on the hotel driveway but the front desk and cops dealt with the matter quickly and efficiently my room was standard when i bought it but it seemed way bigger in there very please no locks on the bahroom but that wasnt an issue for myself but could be for other guests i suppose michael on the front desk was very friendly and professional anything i needed he helped as quickly and thoroughly as he could another front desk lady with cult brown hair sorry i cant remember your name was amazing and really helped me out when it cae to directions and tourism;5
marrakech is a bustling romantic city and the medina especially the souks can be overwhelming stepping into riad kheirredine one feels peace each nook is beautifully decorated paying tribute to the culture of morocco the rooms are comfortable ours is right by a small lovely pool and there are plenty of chaise longues to relax on attention to detail in decor is reflected in the riads attention to detail with guest needs there are straw hats on small tables by the pool bowls of fresh fruit on the terraces complimentary laundryironing service the riad gives you a phone so that you can use at any point if you get lost and someone will come find you but that wasnt really why we used the phone when we found what we thought were good deals at the market we;5

i loved this hotel very nice and quiet but at the same time with a lot of life very chic and elegant the rooms are stuning the location is perfect next to central park restautantes etc the hotel has a nightclub and you dont have to wait in line to enter if you are staying at the hotel on the roof there is a swimming pool and a chill out place to enjoy the evening after a long day of walking finally for me was excellent i loved it the only downside for me was the price it is quite expensive the night is 300 euros and up but it is new york soooo everithing is expensive;5
tried several hotels in nyc but this one was the best so far room newly fixed up and clean incl bathroom my room was larger than the ones i had before in other hotels in that quarter its nyc the most rooms in this price range are between 8 and ca 18 sqm nicely situated at 54thbroadway therefore quite noisy outside bed was better than my own service was perfect and very friendly booked a shuttle for us mourad which worked perfect try a local beer at the bar with perfect service by javier will come back next time note there is no free wifi in rooms and floors only in the lobby wifi in rooms costs 10 can get breakfast buffet for 18 without previous notice;5

truly the best welcome i have ever received at any hotel the staff are amazing nothing is too much trouble the riad itself is a beautiful and peaceful haven within the walls of a hustling frantic medina the taxi cannot take you to the door of the riad but they send a guide with a cart to escort you and your luggage the 10 minute walk from the taxi point upon arrival we were offered wet flannels fruit cakes tea coffee etc there were six people in our party and all three rooms were traditionally furnished and spotlessly clean each couple was given a mobile phone by the riad with all staff numbers preset and told to call any time of day or night if we needed any assistance or someone to come and guide us back to the riad if we were lost later that day the guide;5

as a brit i read the reviews of this hotel prior to booking and saw majority positive but some negative reviews also that made me slightly concerned about our 8 night stay all i can report is our experience which was very positive we arrived after a long flight and long delays through jfk to a warm greeting at reception this was approx 230 pm they were fully booked and advised our room wasnt available yet but they would try and get it ready asap so we had a quick snack in tick tock diner attached to hotel we came back out at about 330 and reception said our room was ready we asked for a fridge fully aware that they are not provided as standard they advised they would hold 45 deposit per day against my credit card which would be refunded at the end of our stay they;5

first visit to marrakesh and split the time between 3 nights here and 5 in an all inclusive resort outside the city walls from the minute we arrived at the riad we were made to feel like house guests and shown real hospitality it was the little touches that made the difference being sat down on arrival and brought tea while yajaira told us about the riad and the city the guide who took us from the riad to the start of the market area the mobile phone to ensure we would always find our way back being taken to maison arabe for a cookery course rather than just being given directions having breakfast set up wherever we wanted to eat it and being asked what else they could cook for us other than the basic scrumptious morrocan conserves and pastries that were the standard;5

i was a little skeptical about the quality of the rooms after reading some of the reviews i was able to get a good price on the rooms and knew there would be a steep parking fee but the cost was outweighed by some of my other options plus breakfast was complimentary and those same reviews said that the breakfast was the best part so i took the chance the hotel is very conveniently located to all the major attractions of los angeles and hollywood its about a 30 min drive to santa monica and 4560 mins to lax depending on traffic great food attractions and shopping is all extremely close by but not walking distance the metro is across the street with tons of bus stops in the area if you arent renting a car lyft and uber are also all over the place in the city and our;5
a hidden gem the riad kheirredine exceeded our expectations we arrived in marrakech to a swift welcome through customs into a air conditioned car straight to the riad staff greeted and walked us through the maize of streets and alleys to the riad where we were welcomed by elena and the team we were swiftly booked in and shown to our room which took us back to the grandeur of days gone by and immersed us in colour comfort and luxury our first night we dined on the rooftop to a sun setting in the west and a full moon rising in the east the food and service were both excellent and considering our location it was quiet and peaceful we had many glasses of wine and nibbles starting at the majestic atlas mountains whilst lounging around the pool with staff effortlessly;5

my friend and i arrived in marrakech in the heat of the summer and were so thankful to have chosen riad kheirredine the design of the riad was spectacular the staff was incredibly incredibly thoughtful coming back everyday really felt like such a respite from the heat and there were some days where we spend hours on the rooftop where they had a pool one of two i cant recommend this place enough they have moroccan iced tea on tap cookies in every room fruits in all the common areas and staff who are attentive and always willing to help they would also have someone accompany us the first couple of days as we learned to navigate the maze to the entrace of the medina you also get your own phone that allows you to have 247 contact with the hotel i will definitely;5
this hotel is great you walk in and the lobby oozes charm and sophistication we checked in and got offered a better room wow that room was massive it over looked universal and we couldnt wait to see it the staff were happy to help but the most helpful people were the breakfast staff we went down for breakfast at 8am and were confronted with the largest breakfast selection i have ever seen in my life if you like to eat well before a day in the parks then this is the place for you it took us about 10 minutes to walk round it all whatever you could have thought about eating or drinking it was there in abundance funny thing was we were the only ones at breakfast at that time so we had the pick of the bunch the breakfast staff took us round the room showing us;5

my girlfriend and i stayed at the riad last month for my 30th birthday and had a wonderful memorable time the location for us was ideal â a convenient short walk to the souks main square but away from the main tourist hub to get a flavour of local life and a bit of respite in the evening facilities likewise were faultless â we loved the spacious classic eucalyptus room and the beautiful roof terrace for an evening drink breakfast was a daily feast so much so that we barely needed to eat lunch most days above all though the service was outstanding the staff were unfailingly friendly warm good humoured thoughtful and attentive it was the little details â from getting a mobile phone to use in case of emergency the lovely tea on arrival with valentina the;5

we were really impressed as of the ease of getting to the airport with the shuttle which arrives every 15 minutes parking the car with the valet was easy but the parking lot does get filled up the room was clean and comfortable for an airport hotel i would give it 5 stars not a 5 star resort but it worked great for our needs of an early morning flight;5
the hotel is old and large and i appreciate the fact that i couldnt hear any noises elsewhere in the hotel its the staff that really uptic this hotel from good to exceptional i was on my last nerve when we checked in and there was an issue with the cc used to pay for the room which was quickly resolved but the front desk worker was kind enough to upgrade our reservation and provide us with a room that had a balcony larger than my living room at home absolute stunning views and breath of tranquility the housekeeping staff whom we never saw were magical our room was positively spotless each day they were wonderful and the doorman was friendly and confident of finding transportation for us in drenching weather so while the actual hotel itself was nice;5

we really enjoyed our recent stay at riad kheirredine from booking through check out all communications were clear and easy and the staff was very helpful i would recommend getting a transfer from the airport to the riad this made everything easy and effortless the riad itself is a beautiful oasis in the crowded medina some may feel that it is difficult to locate but we found that the staff were always willing to accompany us outside the riad if needed and after once or twice we were easily able to find our way to and from the riad the staff were extremely helpful at all times and really made our stay pleasant the riad itself is beautiful and relaxing by the roof top pool was a great balance to the crowded medina it was a wonderful stay and should we find;5

found this great little place through tripadvisor booking was simple and paid in euros on check out offer of collection by car from airport was welcome and due to the location in the medina necessary we would never have found the riad if we had tried to get there alone the short walk from the city gate through the winding and dimly lit lanes with the porters was the start to an amazing break in marrakech behind the door was a little piece of heaven hot towels mint tea and one of our hostesses waiting to welcome us we stayed in the rose room big comfortable bed great shower and a lovely view over the original courtyard and pool the rest of the riad looked exquisite very well appointed with some authentic moroccan touches one of the waiters took us into the;5

i stayed here for the first time last evening i brought my 12 yo daughter to see a broadway play i chose this hotel based on the great price and amazing reviews it received i was not disappointed the people working there were the friendliest and most helpful people iâve experienced in my travels the rooms were nice with bottles of water and a variety of fruit on the desk in our room my daughter loved the robes and slippers that were left on each of our beds and was excited about the marge shower it was such a great stay i booked another stay next month for a conference i have to attend thank you for making this special mommy daughter overnight so special;5
i really enjoyed my stay i felt very safe and secure here the staff was friendly and helpful a great dining experience at carmines wonderful italian food which is just a few blocks from hotel i took the train to penn station and would advise first timers to ask for train 2 or 3 when they arrive so that they get on correct train to hotel as it is very close would definately stay here again;5
you cannot beat this location if you are visiting universal studios also well placed for a visit by car to hollywood and the griffith observatory we had a family of 4 in one room which was a challenge but it was a spacious room with good facilities had booked an extra night to allow for a mid afternoon check out before flying home we were only charged a small extra rather than the quoted extra night which was a welcome gesture we also enjoyed the pool;5

its hard to search for and find hotels in the city with two beds was thrilled to find this with the new yorker and even more thrilled with the room and hotel we booked a standard room with 2 double beds and ended up in a very spacious especially by ny standards corner room with 2 double beds that had been recently renovated the beds were comfortable we were on the 22nd floor with a nice view street noise was not noticeable in the room the bed linens were fabulous and the beds very comfy the bathroom was smallish typical ny but had been updated so was clean fresh and modern a huge bonus is that we never waited more then a few seconds for an elevator unheard of in ny hotels located almost across the street from penn station we arrived by train;5
i gave my wife this get quick trip as a christmas present we had a quick get away to nyc to take in the sights and see a broadway show the hotel was quiet clean and in a great midtown location the front desk clerk mohammed was very helpful and checked in with us to make sure everything was in order outstanding experience;5
my husband brought me here for a surprise trip for my 30th birthday and he couldnt have chosen a better place he even had a surprise of his own when we were shown to our room and they had upgraded us to an imperial suite the riad is just beautiful from the abundant plants growing in the courtyard to the beautiful tiles and decor to the serene plunge pools to the amazing roof terrace and our suite was very luxurious 4 poster bed balcony slipper bath and separate shower but what really makes this place is the staff they go above and beyond to make your stay not just a comfortable one but an unforgettable one they were very friendly and helpful always sending a guide out with you to help navigate the winding streets of the medina if required gave excellent;5
from beginning to end we were happy with our choice of the empire hotel for valentines day weekend from pasquale at the front desk who was gracious and helpful at checkinto our spacious accommodations with a great view of the lincoln center and broadwaythe staff and ambience at the lobby barand the consistently friendly helpful doormen day or nightcan not say enough great things about this hotel obviously the location and surprising value initially drew usbut the actual experience exceeded any expectations we had prior to the visit;5
we stayed here for 2 nights while visiting universal studios location cannot be beat short walk to universal or take the free shuttle which we did had a view of the main entrance from our room stayed in a king bed room with a great big window and beautiful view of universal studios check in was a breeze and we appreciated the free wifi as hhmembers parking is paid but so it is at universal studios so take the shuttle and pay only once our room rate included free continental breakfast which we had on our first morning there they allow you to pay an upgrade fee of 10 pp to upgrade to the full buffet which has hot food and other offerings the continental breakfast included only yoghurt toast fruits and cereals and some other breads it is normally offered for an insane;5
my room was very nice and clean the service was great i found the evening manager ms raquel oliver very courteous and helpful she made our stay there very relaxing and enjoyable i liked everthing about this hotel;5
this was my first visit to the los angeles area i was here for 3 days of training on a new business from the moment i entered the lobby upon my arrival until i checked out a 330 in the morning my experience in this hyatt was tremendous every staff member i encountered was very knowledgeable of their position in the hotel and treated the hotel as if it was there personal business the facilities were spectacular from the power outlet inside the guest room door the exceptional fitness center to the meeting rooms all displayed the leaderships attention to detail the food and beverage was consistently perfect french press coffee selections for breaks fresh matzoh ball soup for lunch and perfectly seared sea scallops for dinner created an atmosphere of caring;5
what a fantastic hotel my family stayed for 9 days whilst visiting la and could not have wished for a better location minutes from universal has a great pool area is close to the metro for getting around town a very affordable method of transport by the way and only one stop from hollywood boulevard and with superbly helpful staff who helped us with everything from a great itinerary of what to see around la to arranging rental cars and limos for us i travel extensively on business and stay in hotels worldwide on a weekly basis i would certainly rate this hotel and its staff in my top five hotels;5
we went to la as part of a 40th birthday trip we decided to stay at the hilton because of the location it was close to most of the activities we had planned we arrived much earlier than check in and decided to sit at the bar and have a few drinks and some food max greeted us and immediately made us feel at home he suggested restaurants for dinner and lunch and even a few day trips we could take max also made some wonder drinks selections and split a salad on two plates so my friend and i could share it easier he keep us entertained the entire time max truly went above and beyond when he surprised my friend with a cheesecake with happy birthday message on it he made the wait for the room seem to go by so quickly and help make our trip better with his suggestions thanks;5
the hotel is great room was really nice and the bed was very comfortable i needed to wake up fairly early each morning and carlos i dont know his last name or his position was always there to greet me in the lobby and ask if everything was okay and offered me a bottle of water such a nice guy and a great way to start the day;5
this was our second stay at this hotel the location is exellent for visiting univeral studios and citywalk a 5 to 10 minute uphill walk visiting burbank and warner brothers studios or nbc or visiting hollywood with easy access to the freeway the views from the hotel rooms are fantastic and the staff is very friendly just be aware that there is no longer a lounge or dedicated concierge for executive level stays only the free continental breakfast in a room adjacent to the cafe on the main floor also it is a long walk inside the hotel to get from the selfpark garage to the main elevators the rooms are typical hilton hotel rooms;5
we planned to visit morocco at the end of a trip to spain we went on the ferry from tarifa to tangier and then by train to marrakech we chose riad kheirredine based on the good reviews contrary to some reviews the hotel is located not too far from anywhere in the medina which of course contains narrow alleyways that might be difficult to navigate on the first day or so after a couple of forays landmarks are easily remembered however the provided phone is a great comfort even if it doesnt have to be used the hotel is a one off superstar italian owned and situated in the very moroccan marrakech medina we stayed for ten days and really had a fantastic holiday the reception is friendly and welcoming our room poivre was very comfortable and beautifully placed;5
i stayed here recently for four nights to attend a dodger game celebrate my nephews college graduation and visit my native la the customer service was excellent everyone i encountered were extremely friendly a nod to lucas at the front desk who i âbotheredâ a few too many times and he was very patient and nice once i was standing in line at the front desk and one of the other employees although waiting on other guests acknowledged me and said to the effect âiâll be right with youâ i never have experience that level of great service unfortunately i didnât get his name it canât be easy being so friendly to so many guests in such a large property but the employees at this hilton accomplished it very well the hotel overall is very nice as well we loved the pool;5
we stayed at the hilton as we were wanting to go to universal studios and wanted to be able to walk there we were not disappointed the hilton is directly across the road and provides a bus if you cant be bothered walking right to the door very sizable rooms and very comfortable we would 100 stay again;5
we just left and we canât wait to book again with the riad kheirredine the staff is incredible the service is horspair there is no words i can use to describe my journey at the riad this is the place to stay in marrakesh;5
we were skeptical once arriving to the hotel but it was not so bad the reviews are accurate the area is okay the hotel belongs somewhere else we had a nice room facing inner court yard aim for that if you can upon check in make time to check out the bar pool sauna small gym and courtyard seating area bar there as well but not open it seems breakfast is mediocre at best bland but options for toppings staff was professional at least cynthia jermain and anna whom i encountered the most knowledgeable and always smiling unlike the staff at the w hotel wish there was room service 7 day a week bar and bell service but maybe in the near future this can be a 45 star hotel happy with our stay and pay the parking people and do your research i always look;5
this is an amazing place to stay had superb service even before my arrival all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly from the hotel manager to the reservations ladies a special word of thank you must be made of gabina who treated us like we were her own family thank you to the lovely people made our stay here memorable;5

my overall experience was great moving to the upper floor was certainly an improvement but beds still are uncomfortable rooms are clean and staff mostly friendly some more than others general front desk manager curt horner is a great guy and very pofessional wifi definately needs improvement my biggest complaint elevators are quite slow with a long wait time overall the hotel is good for your money spent;5
we could not have picked a better hotel in london from the reception staff to the breakfast staff we received excellent service all round our recently renovated room could not be faulted there was air conditioning which was greatly needed on out heatwave weekend we looked out over a courtyard but didnt bother us as it was nice and quiet for sleeping and the bed was very comfortable as well cleanliness could not be faulted in all areas the position of the hotel along the river embankment the london eye parliament was spot on and within walking distance of sites or waterloowestminster tubes if needed the breakfast was excellent we did not have an evening meal as we had a show and meal already booked but if you wanted anything different there were many restaurants;5

after booking a nyc trip via a travel consultant we needed up in an absolute hovel of a hotel we immediately checked out and found the empire the place is really clean and the entrance and lobby are beautiful it was my birthday and pasquale on reception welcomed us immediately i told him of the horrible experience we were having and he was able to help us he made sure our room was upgraded it was beautiful with 3 large windows and views across the lincoln centre which is beautiful when lit up at night he also messaged me as soon as the room was ready before actual check in time as an emergency he could probably tell o hadnât slept and was having the worst birthday ever the staff and really helpful and friendly especially pasquale the roof top bar in the sun;5

this was one of the best hotels ive ever stayed at the property is beautiful with gorgeous decorations and plush lounging areas everywhere the rooms were decorated beautifully and were extremely clean the breakfasts and dinners were some of the best meals we had in morocco what sets this place apart above everything is the exceptional service every person there is friendly and helpful and will always smile and say hello the staff at the front desk took the time to go over the map of marrakech with us when we got there and set up everything we did during our stay they had great restaurant and activity suggestions and were more than willing to make reservations and bookings for us they provided us with a cell phone so that we could call them whenever we needed and;5
i arrived at a late time gustavo at check in was very nice and printed me direction on how to go to staple center on train i was sad no breakfast was available but the nice room and service made up for that;5
the hotel is right next to the airport which is very helpful so as to avoid long expensive cab rides in la traffic the hotel is modern clean and spacious rooms are very comfortable and all the amenities are right there enjoyed a great view and enjoyed a sofa and chair in my room there could be a bit more light in the bathrooms but natural light from the windows helped that housekeeping staff are great and do a fabulous job;5
we were very pleased with our overall experience with this hotel from the outside we thought we would be staying in an older hotel we were very pleasantly surprised when we entered and found a beautiful lobbyand modern rooms we were greeted immediately upon our arrival by the doorman who brought our luggage right into the hotel the front desk staff was incredibly warm and welcoming we were pleasantly surprised to be able to get our room immediately upon arrival as we had a very early flight our room was upgraded to a jr suite which was wonderful for the added space but not good for the third member of our party as she was relegated to the sleep sofa that was not a comfortable experience for her sadly the hotel does not have a restaurant but does have a;5

a great place to stay with easy access to hollywood area some nice restaurants within walking distance the neighborhood is not the best lots of homeless and drug addicts hang around about two blocks away but the hotel grounds are immune to that if you walk towards the hospitals and griffith park its relatively nice with more of that hollywood feel we walked back to the hotel from the hollywood walk of fame with a 4yo and felt save there is a large secure parking lot for a fee and its close to public transit we really enjoyed the morning breakfast and the pool is really cool as well in general the place has a cool hollywood vibe to it i will definitely stay there again someday;5
my most recent stay here was the perfect staycation completely forgot that the alcove room option was selected when the reservation was made so i was surprised and thrilled upon entering the room look at the recent photos i uploaded for this hotel the alcove room is amazing and the view was absolutely gorgeous overlooking the valley we were ecstatic it was beautiful the front desk staff and bellhops were warm welcoming and courteous as usual and the room service attendants were welcoming and helpful as well i love staying at this hotel because even though the area is always busy the hotel is like a retreat always quiet and always feels like home its so nice to just walk around and enjoy the different things going on in the hotel or right outside by the;5
at checkin mohammed informed us that we had been upgraded to a family suite we loved the view and the extra space was very much appreciated the location of the hotel made it so handy to catch the subway the lirr or just go for a nice walk to many of the nearby restaurants we feel that the few extra dollars was well worth it;5

this hotel is a bit older than most but it is extremely clean and the staff is wonderful the bellmen were terrific and everyone working there was helpful and accomodating location is great coffeewater in room is expensive so i would go to the corner starbucks for those items and bring in your own water i could not have asked for better service than they provided with a smile;5

the hotel is great the room is really clean organized and cozy the location is superb really close to the subway red line which connects you from downtown to the famous hollywood boulevard and for all other subway lines the breakfast is just something so good that is worth itself the experience wonderful omelets and scrambled eggs the parking is a little expensive but i could easily have stayed without a car there since the location is great but the greatest thing for me was the service not only when i was in the hotel were all the assistants really helpful and nice with all la information even printing a show ticket for me specially nancy but also when i left i even forgot a personal object and gisel the assistant front desk manager as soon as i requested;5
this hotel is fantastic i was a little weary about it since all the reviews were kind of shabby but i was pleasantly surprised when i arrived and everything went up hill from there i disagree with all these negative reviews because i cant possibly see how they could have had a terrible time here unless of course they themselves made it terrible first and foremost the hotel is right near the metro rail which will take you pretty much anywhere in the la area so most of the time you dont even need a car or a bus second the hotel staff was very friendly and helped with any problems we had also the free breakfast every morning was a godsend and helped save a lot of money on food the rooms were cozy and comfortable and the city surrounding the hotels was;5

located directly across from central park and just north from the hustle and bustle of manhattanâ¦ itâs a quiet brownstone look with a modern feel the staffâ¦ all of them went above and beyond accommodating my needs not surprising i supposeâ¦ being that this is one of the buildings and locations that helped aid the city during a time that it was being crippled by covid19 if youâre looking for an inexpensive stay in an expensive city with first class treatmentâ¦ park west hotel is it;5

morocco was a lifelong dream that lived up to all expectations and riad kheirredine helped to fulfill the dream the first thought of entering the medina was what did i get myself into after being met my a hotel employee who took out luggage and guided us to the riad we were welcomed by sara and elena who greeted us with tea and cookies and then got us settled in to the most amazing room ever the room was spacious clean and quite i felt like a parttime sultan i quickly and easily learned my way out the breakfasts and foods were perfect as were the spa treatments the staff assisted us with day guides about the city and to the atlas mountains also the loaned us a smart phone with google maps and the riad phone number should we get lost i would return in a;5
staying at this riad was an amazing experience i think a riad in general is a better option than a traditional hotel when in marrakech as it could almost be considered a tourist activity on its own kheirredine is tucked away in a maze of alleys about a 20minute walk from the medina but fear not they will arrange for someone to come and walk you to the front door service is just top top notch once we arrived valentina welcomed us warmly with mint tea and some sweets she provided us a local cellphone preloaded with the hotel and her own number and insisted that we could call her at any time day or not if we had any issues we were told we could order any drinks except for alcohol or soda at any time as part of our room rate we definitely took advantage of;5

we were checked in welcomed by a very polished staff at the front desk we didnt realize that picture of the signage was not the front of the hotel when we pulled in so be aware that it is a gem in a soso portion of la however the rest of the hotel was well decorated and our rooms were much more spacious than what we envisioned from the website photos the food was excellent and the kitchen staff oralia sonia were very charming i recommend this boutique hotel for anyone who wants a great value at a low price if you dont mind a lack of scenery in the immediate neighborhood that the hotel happens to be situated in the rest of what it has to offer within its walls is a remarkable value especially compared with hotels that offer less room and fewer amenities within;5

this riad has it allâ¦ it is easy to find it is well located in the medina it is beautiful with a ton of high end amenities but it is their hospitality that really stands out i booked my long weekend at the last minute they were able to accommodate me even though it meant switching rooms which they made so seamless they even adjusted the price upon my late arrival they had prepared a late night snack for me that morning arrange a local guide to show me around and even allowed a very late check out on my departure day i took advantage of their winter special which included airport transfers a hammam at their onsite spa and a bottle of wine they offer unlimited bottled water too i canât say enough about their service it was simply;5

loved this hotel it is in a great location so close to times square and macys for shopping next to subway about 34 blocks down to get to where you want to be i would totally recommend using subway rather than taxiubers they cost so much and you spend majority of the time just in traffic google tells you what subway to use and where to get off easy as that it costs next to nothing as well we used airtrain to get to this hotel so took us about 50 mins to get to the hotel from jfk the hotel itself has everything you need we was on 4th floor so the soundnoise wasnt as bad as if you were to be on the ground floor i imagine you are in new york no matter where you stay within walking distance you will have noise we had a private bathroom bathshower was lovely and;5
the empire hotel is located in one of the best locations to visit central park lincoln center great restaurants fantastic shopping at columbus circle and more the hotel staff was very helpful and friendly it is very clean and has great views the only drawback is the rooms are on the small size my friends suite was big and fantastic the rooftop bar restaurant is amazing awesome drinks and food the pool looks beautiful;5

we were one staying 2 nights and the hotel was great for that length of stay but it would have been fine to stay longer the staff was really nice the hotel bar was quaint the location is in times square but not right in the middle which i prefer a lot of people complained about the wifi but that didnt affect us really i would definitely stay again;5
thats about the only thing the fine people didnt do for me in our 3 night stay here their level of thought and care has been exceptional and made our first visit to marrakesh a great one read the other reviews for all the specifics of the room and facilities etcid only duplicate them im pretty fussy with rating hotels but i can honestly give this one an excellent rating;5

just stayed for 3 nights in this beautiful riad dont stay anywhere else firstly the staff are amazing they could not be more helpful in arranging tours of the city dinner reservations providing tips for the souks and ensuring the drinks keep arriving they provided you with a phone if you get lost keep in contact with taxi drivers and even send you with a chaperone if you are not sure of the way at no cost from arrival to departure there was nothing they couldnt help with and went out of their way to do so the riad is authentic and beautiful with multiple terraces and rooms hidden away everywhere we felt like we had a terrace and several day beds to ourselves and loved soaking up the sun after a day of exploring the city breakfast on the terrace is idyllic and you;5

prior to leaving the us for vacation we arranged an airport pickup through the riad and just as promised our driver was there waiting for us with a sign for the riad kheirredine our driver mohammed was friendly and told us about the significance of many important sites as we passed them on our drive i would highly recommend asking the riad to arrange for the airport pickup as haggling for a cab at the airport might be a bit overwhelming upon arrival mohammed dropped us off at the taxi stand in sidi ben slimane where ismail was already there waiting for us cars cannot fit into alley ways of the medina so you must go by foot from that point we were greeted by ismail one of the riads staff to cart our bags and walk us through the winding medina alleys to the;5

firstly there is little point putting up any personal photos as the jane website is so good and totally representative of what you will find there i got to stay in a bunk room with a companion and then a single room by myself the decor is beautiful and the rooms and communal bathrooms so nice that it balances out the lack of space if travelling with a partner pack as lightly as you can to make the most of the space the single cabin has a space under the bed for your suitcase so best to put what you may need straight into one of the drawers and then store the rest away for your trip the staff were fantastic and are a really great asset so i hope that the management appreciate them if you want to feel like youre in an agatha christie then this is the hotel for you it;5

we chose this riad on the basis of its trip advisor reviews and we were not disappointed the place itself is fantastic but it is the friendliness of the staff that makes it five star no point just repeating the previous reviews as i can endorse all the positive comments and any negative ones im sure are just minor niggles so a couple of things that may not be covered elsewhere or may not be that clear from the website bring a swimming costume there are two pools one inside and one on the roof neither are huge but after a day in the heat and bustle of the medina theyre a great place to cool down the hotel hammam is excellent good value around 55 euros including massage and a friendly relaxed option if youre a little nervous about the whole thing if theres;5

we had two rooms on the 27th floor of the new yorker the plus point were the views directly of the empire state building and the friendly staff in the hotel especially the cheery guy who serves the coffees and teas in the foyer the shower was a bit weird it was either very hot or cold and had to adjusted delicately to achieve the right temperature also for some reason the entry cards for the room stopped working three times so all the way back to the reception from floor 27 to get them fixed there are plenty of lifts but be prepared to wait a few minutes each time for one as it is a huge hotel with hundreds of guests that said we had so much to do during our stay that we were not in the hotel very often and the rooms are ideal id definitely stay here again but would;5

this hotel is very nice and in a great and safe location the housekeeping was excellent and the beds were very comfortable we stayed for 5 days and really got to know the property we were in hollywood visiting family and the only negative thing i found was that family was not able to park for a reasonable price 3 hours cost 1700 and anything over 3 hours cost 2500 i also requested extra pillows with my reservation that never showed up but all in all the accomidations were very nice and i would recommend this to anyone wanting to visit hollywood and universal studios;5

the empire hotel is well situated in the heart of the west side across the street from lincoln center on one side and next to some good restaurants with sidewalk seating under large awnings on the other side the hotel is very well run with decent sized roomsa happening lobby bar and a good restaurant on the mezzanine level just one block from central park and a short cab ride or 15 minute walk from most of the broadway theaters this is a perfect location for a weekend in the city if you visit in the summer bring a swim suit since they have a pool;5
i have stayed in this hotel 3 times and i must say each time was a great experience from the the moment i stepped out of the cab and greeted by the bellhops great vibes and even more when greeted by the front desk i have had the chance to have the same guy check me in his name is tony gonzalez and he made me feel not like a guest but like a relative to the wyndham family i actually got a chance to visit the nikola tesla room on the 33rd floor as well on my last visit way cool;5

the location was perfect for us we only stayed one night and the front desk was happy to store our bags in the early morning of our arrival day and late into the evening of our departure day everyone from the front desk to the bell hops to the cleaning staff were helpful and accommodating we were pleasantly surprised for the cost;5
everything was up to par and beyond the location was ideal right next to lincoln center the view from my window was phenomenal yet the room was quiet and comfortable staff were friendly and accommodating my stay went without a hitch;5
the staff was friendly helpful and professional this was our first trip to nyc and when we come back the ameritania will be the only place we stay i did not catch the ladies name that checked me in around 78pm but she was so nice and i had questions about my travel and she gave me great advice and helped us set up a taxi for the day we went back to the airport i didnât have to worry since she set it up for me and let us know it was a flat rate from the hotel saâid not sure of the spelling was extremely helpful and friendly jeffrey was just awesome made us feel super welcome gave us suggestions on things to do and see he seemed like he genuinely loved his job and he absolutely deserves a huge raise he helped us without hesitation thank you for an amazing;5

a really modern luxury hotel the kids loved the view from our room which looked out over universal studios seeing hogwarts so close was a particular thrill for my youngest daughter every morning when she woke up the staff were great the receptionist let us check in early when we turned up all hot and sweaty after walking up the hill from the metro station and gave us free bottles of water and then extended our check our time at no extra cost universal is just a five minute walk away although there is a free shuttle if you dont want to walk the metro station is just down the hill and will take you across la on what is a very easy cheap system a really top notch hotel and we were sad to leave;5
we really enjoyed our stay at the empire hotel its location is very good right next to central park and near 2 subway stations it is still rather quiet as quiet as new york city can be but within 15 minutes walking distance to timessquare and the most important part of broadway the staff was very helpful in every way they helped organizing the transport back to the airport gave good advices and most important helped immediately when we had a complaint about an other guest being too loud the rooms were very clean and for a city trip the room was also quite spacious all in all we really liked it and would stay there again best wishes from austria;5

we had a wonderful stay at this hotel our room was on the 23rd floor we were given a little fun and funky multiroom suite we had a dinningsitting area with a desk and open views down and over the hudson there was an apart bedroom with 2 double beds there was a bathroom and an apart wc everything was clean and kept neat thats important yes things were a little dated here and there but that is exactly what we love a place where you can tell that people have felt that they could relax and live in surf and you will find that there is some really cool history in this building as well the staff was always friendly and always gave us a smile when we came in;5
room was very clean and tidy with a super comfortable bed jeff and the concierge team were very polite and friendly the reception staff also were very accommodating considering we arrived way before checkin time and allowed us into a room with options to come back later that day and ask for a better view if we wanted one negative thing was the tv reception wasnt wokring that good but we didnt mind;5
an old art deco hotel with lots of character we were upgraded by mohammed to a room with a view lying in bed looking at the empire state building was incredible mohammed also gave us vouchers for a complimentary breakfast in the tick tock diner excellent food we used the subway a lot and this hotel is in the perfect location to go everywhere would definitely stay here again;5

just returned back from new york yesterday after 4 days the whole experience was fabulous from start to finish this was defiantly helped by staying at this hotel the location is perfect penn station is literally next door so you can be on the subway within minutes of leaving your room or if you want to walk everything is within walking distance the hotel its self is very big our room was on the 21st floor clean and exactly what you need it for the room was an ok size for 2 people storage for cases and your shopping was a little bit limited but didnt make a difference to how much we enjoyed it the beds were very comfortable and we both slept soundly after full on days walking would defiantly stay at this hotel again;5
nice room with wooden floor and have a good size nice pool area and a perfect breakfast by jose and lupe the parking is in the high end but a big space and security lot of palms around hotel and pool area just as it should be in hollywood;5
we were only here on a layover and needed somewhere close to the airport to sleep the shuttle runs 24 hours a day and was very convenient to get back and forth the hotel is very close to a runway so you will hear planes taking off very late but it wasnât bad as i was tired and needed sleep which came quickly in the comfortable bed;5
traveling alone i needed a hotel in manhattan that didnt rob me blind which was hard to find this hotel fit my budget but i was a little worried about the shared bathroom and the small room size however i was pleasantly surprised with this hotel the place was very cute and well decorated the staff was friendly and helpful the room was the literally the size of my walk in closet at home but i actually didnt have any issues with it they made sure the room had lots of little amenities that made it feel complete like a bathrobe slippers bottled water ac fan window storage space safe etc i didnt feel like i was lacking anything that id get from a normal hotel room the shared bathroom was always clean and well maintained i was there for 4 nights and i never;5

we have stayed at this hotel twice and had a very positive experience both times the rate for the hotel is almost always lower than at other hotels and the service has always been top notch the rooms are larger than your standard nyc hotel rooms and are very clean the location between times square and central park means that you have access to everything you would ever want the only possible reason for the lower rate must be that the hotel doesnt really have many rooms with a view of the nyc skyline but if this doesnt bother you you wont be disappointed;5
i had a business meeting of four people and a bit of a sticky situation the lobby was full but avelino took me under his wing found a nook moved things around and made it possible for us to hear each other and sit together undisturbed when one of my party arrived and happened to speak to him at the concierge desk he knew immediately where to bring them and they were amazed that he had it all figured out hats off give this man a bonus;5
we had a junior king suite which was much larger than i would have expected for ny the bathroom was a totally normal size as well which means it was big for an nyc room the room was really clean and the furnishingdecor was great the lobby had a cool vibe without being inappropriate for my 14 year old daughter the room was quiet and not a lot of street noise at all the location is amazing we could see lincoln center from our room i will definitely be staying here when in ny again i dont understand the mediocre reviews here;5
booked a family room for two nights and we were âwowedâ by the view as soon as we stepped into the room we had a amazing view of the universal studio the hotel is within a short walking distance to the universal studio hollywood the concierge is always ready to offer advice we also managed to checkin effortlessly the bell boy who sent out luggage to the room was very professional and polite the room has a full king size bed and a roll out bed bathroom is clean with excellent amenities parking is reasonably priced too we enjoyed the stay and absolutely do not mind paying the price for it would definitely be back again if we are around the area in future;5

we are a family of five who stayed at the hilton when visiting universal our rooms were spacious clean and excellent breakfast was broad and varied and far better than in the park and dinner at five and dime lovely i would like to draw attention to some problems with housekeeping however and how well a potentially big problem for us was resolved we have been travelling around the states for a month and had put a lot of laundry in for cleaning which unfortunately didnât turn up in the allocated time it then seemed to go missing overnight and we were concerned we had lost a lot of valuable laundry and would have to move to our next city without it instead of this every single member of staff did their best to locate it overnight and communicate proactively with us i;5
last minute business trip tuned into a 3 day hotel stay the rooms are small but cozy it was all i need during my last minute trip nancy was exceptionally friendly when i called to book and although their restaurant is currently closed i had no problems ordering delivery or walking up the street so some local restaurants im currently planning a trip to la with my fiance and we will definitely be staying there again ð;5
one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had and we are frequent visitors to the usa the rooms are modern with a great walk in shower and the location is superb for central park and the lincoln centre the lobby and bar areas were really nice with loads of room to relax and there is the added bonus of a rooftop bar with great views of the city the doormen were very friendly and made you feel welcome;5
my wife and i stay here every year when we go to new york on vacation and we love it the staff are friendly its located in a nice neighborhood with quick access to the subway the 1 line and weve never had a problem with cleanliness weve stayed in more expensive hotels where we received less service the pricing is budget conscious so you have to realize that its not the ritz but if youd rather spend your money on seeing and enjoying new york city instead of on the room where for the most part youre only going to be sleeping anyways you cant go wrong with the morningside inn;5
i recently stayed and thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the empire it is well located near central park and lincoln center there are restaurants in walking distance and the staff was helpful and friendly;5
excellent hotel excellent location clean rooms great for exploring nyc coffee and fridge in room could not of asked for anything better 5 stars would recommend close to subway and bars restaurants shops;5
the staff was second to none also the location made it very easy to get around the greater la area i would definitely give them 2 thumbs up keep up the great work and client centered interactions thank you again;5

the rooms are very clean beds are comfortable the gym is outstanding with a nice airport view the cafe in the lobby has great coffee and breakfast sandwiches i would highly recommend staying here if youre near the airport;5
every staff member i encountered was incredibly friendly and helpful especially aimee at the front desk she was very knowledgeable and pleasant the room and lobby were beautiful and clean we used the valet parking and the drivers took care while driving our vehicle we had room service and it was delicious i wish i could give them 65 stars;5
i was worried we would hear planes all night but despite being on the airport side of the building we couldnt hear anything from outside our primary disappointment was that the pool was offline during our visit and my two kids were pretty devastated by that i really appreciated the ease and check in with the app and the quick responsiveness to a phone call to the front desk when we needed a plunger i also really liked that we could walk from the airport to the hotel with our luggage without problem;5
i had my reservations about staying here its super pricey but it was well worth every penny the service was superb the breakfast was great the rooftop parties every night were fun and lively i would recommend staying here to anyone;5
have stayed at this hotel twice with family and was treated well by the management and staff both times the rooms we occupied were clean and well maintained tick toc diner off the main lobby was a fine and interesting place to get dinner one night;5
stayed here for our holiday in new york and was not disappointed right next to the lincoln centre and a short walk from shops subway central park and times square the room was a good size and the bed was so comfy room was cleaned daily and staff were friendly and helpful was a busy hotel but this did not hinder our experience or cause us to loose any sleep cant fault this hotel at all and would stay here again;5
nice hotel clean and tidy room service varies one day we got all our towels changed another day we got only half off our towels back and room wasnât as good as previous and the bed wasnât made hotel staff friendly same goes for door staff;5
generally the hotel is very good with an excellent locationthis is our second time at staying at this hotel the lifts do take some time to reach you at your floors to take you down to the recpetion and we only had minimal issues with the hot water during our stay yuri at the front desk is very good at got us a great table at a resturant called robert on the 9th floor at columbus circle which we would highly recomend for a good shopping break this hotel ticks all the boxes;5
overall one of the best places i have ever stayed the minute you arrived you were served a large breakfast included in the room cost and we never went hungry since everything was taken care of our bags brought to the room we were given a mobile phone when we left the riad and rooms were serviced 2x daily 100 would stay again;5
just spent 3 nights in riad kheirredine and had a wonderful time there the riad was beautiful and so relaxing the terrace was a great place to rest in the sun or shade our room was spacious very comfortable and very nicely decorated the staff were exceptionally helpful friendly and couldnt do enough for you food was great will definitely return;5

i arrived in nyc earlier this week stayed at empire hotel it was a great hotel awesome location i really enjoyed the cocktails and the service i had a sweet waitress her name was vanessa looking forward in coming back soon;5
my family and i have stayed at this hotel repeatedly when in la because it is an excellent value and well located additionally the rooms are large and the views are great because the hotel sits on a hill the universal studios and city walk are a short distance and there is a tram that will take you there if you dont want to walk the food and service in the restaurant are always excellent as well the buffets are legendary also it is a very convenient hotel if i could make a couple of changesone would be for a more exciting pool and the other for updated bathrooms although they are still nice the pool at the sheraton universal next door has more ambience with a bar but the hotel rooms are not nearly as nice and the service not as good as the hilton;5

im almost at a loss for words to describe how superior this hotel is you can be fooled from the street side appearance ive driven past it on other trips without a thought but once you pull into the parking lot you sense youve found a jewel and a jewel it is from the service to the rooms the courtyard balcony the secluded pool the beautiful entry fountain and the care thats been taken to make this a fine hotel i cant say enough to communicate how absolutely wonderful this hotel is now folks ive traveled 100s of thousands of miles 4 5star chicago ny scottsdale you name it and this is now my favorite hotel stay of all time just look at the pictures beautiful but the kicker the people just plain pleasant nice not that im hoping;5

the room was so amazing soft pillows bed so lovely you just want to stay in it and the bathroom had all the swanky amenities i could wish for and spotlessly clean the staff was very gracious and helpful the front desk folks wanted to ensure our safety in the neighborhood and taught us about uber as the metro wasnt safe at night had a minor coffee maker kerfuffle that was resolved personally by the front desk staff the breakfast was a good experience i would totally stay here again;5

really nice hilton near hollywood universal studios we had 2 nights here myself and my son the bedrooms are a little small compared to normal hilton size the outdoor pool is very nice the restaurant is great however this is not at the theme park entrance like you get the impression of in the website photos it is quite a long walk to the park and and down a hill so wait and take the free shuttle bus pros really nice hilton decorated in a beautiful modern style nice bedroom but small nice pool area good restaurant free wifi but that might be included with ihg membership so might not be free for everyone on site car park not cheap but then if youve paid to stay here its part of the hilton experience cons not near the theme park entrance yes its;5
compared to other hotels in the area the staff stands out as the most friendly besides this hotel is just steps from the lincoln center there is no other hotel that is that close and this is important when seasonticket holders like us just walk to the fiorello or lincoln restaurants and then to the center;5
my wife and two children joined me at the empire on friday november 18th after i had arrived two days earlier for a business conference all 4 of us had a very pleasant stay the check in service rooms breakfast and assistance with the taxi service was very good;5
i could not fault this riad in particular the staff were exceptional and could not do enough for us from before we arrived until our departure everything was taken care of and we felt so well looked after the staff even provide you with a mobile to call them with to meet you when you have finished your day so that you dont get lost the rooms were beautiful and the food was excellent i would recommend this riad to anyone and go so far as to say dont even bother looking elsewhere;5
i was having some challenges with my reservation and i was fortunate to be connected to kevin f at the front desk i mailed my certificate to the hotel and he is diligent in trying to find it in an already stressful situation kevins voice and excellent communication skills assured me that he would do everything in his power to assist me hilton you have a gem in kevin;5
great stay here the health safety measures including temperature scans upon entrance mitigated my nervousness about staying during the pandemic mohammed at the front desk was extremely helpful and kind in accommodating me with everything i needed in a quick and efficient manner canât thank the staff enough;5
a really nice hotel i stayed for 15 nights the hotel is located in a really nice area close to chelsey market theres a lot of shops nearby some kinda expensive though staying at the jane was a great experience the staff was nice and and gladly helped you dont forget an adapter though they do have some at the hotel but they run out quickly and they do keep your room cleanthe madras is kinda hard but if you can live with that you wont find a better hotel for the price you pay and theres water for free in your room good hotel overall and you can get to many of the popular places within an hours walk 42nd street is like 40min away by foot;5
we visited the new yorker back in feb 2019 as a surprise for my 40th birthday the staff were attentive as soon as we walked through the door we were advised of all room fees on check in although we were already aware as we do our homework before travelling the room although small was comfortable clean had everything we would need for our stay we overlooked msg which for a sports nut like me was perfect chose to dine at the tick tock diner for breakfast a few mornings and it was superbgo for the blueberry pancakes loved where the hotel was situated right next to penn stn but also within a decent walk to times sq central park esb rockefeller etc cant wait to return to nyc this hotel will definitely be where we stay;5

this place was great to have as a base for exploring new york it was clean and had everything youd expect from a hotel room it was also cleaned thoroughly daily whilst we were out staff were friendly when you asked for something but were not pushy with trying to offer anything it is situated around the corner from a subway station with easy access to downtown and central park is a short walk away lots of shops and places to eat just outside the door so it is very well placed we thought this was great value for money particulary given its location;5
my kids and i thoroughly enjoyed staying here the pool was beautiful the location was excellent for sightseeing and theme parks and the staff at the breakfast room and food was exceptional great value and we will be staying here again;5
just leaving after a lovely 4 day stay 4 adults beautiful hotel very pleasant staff to welcome you upgraded us on arrival to a huge family room 2 bathrooms beautiful clean great maid service daily ideal for empire state building and times square starbucks over the room and mc donalds all on the door step my only comment would be 5 per bag to leave your case on departure day also a 300 dollar security deposit for room we definitely will return thank you new yorker;5

this hotel is not your typical airport hotel itâs extremely modern very clean and all of the staff that i encountered were wonderful and pleasant from 430 pm when i checked in to 4am when i checked out i could barley hear any airport noise and youâre in walking distance from terminal 1 although they do offer a free shuttle service 24 hours a day that comes every 10 minutes not to mention i slept like a baby in their comfy bed;5

sometimes we are able to gauge an hotel and its service by the way problems are solved having arrived and settled into our room all the lights went outthis was followed by a very long delay for our dinner being served and white wine being presented instead of redwhich resulted in a further waithoweverall of these small situations were resolved with abject apologies and the rest of our 3 night visit was superb the riad is beautifulthe rooms stunningthe service by everyone exemplary and we will be back the roof terrace is a great sunspot with a lovely 360 degree vista over the city;5

the location of this hotel is very convenient they have improved their checkin and checkout process rooms were clean and everything functional although a lighted clock at night would have been better along with a plug by the bed for charging cell phones we ate in the restaurant and the diner and both were good i park in the garage behind the hotel which is typical nyc pricing and waiting for your car it just amazes me the price midtown hotels get per night for a room including various taxes this is better than some but more than it used to be;5
this is literally the least expensive hotel i found in nyc it was clean good location and friendly staff very close to a subway stop so its easy to get anywhere you want to go housekeeping was great too very unobtrusive but had our room cleaned while we were gone if you just want a nice cheap place to stay so you can spend your money elsewherethis is the place i would definitely stay here again;5

we stayed on the 18th floor with a spectacular view of universal studios main entrance and attractions saw harry potter castle all the bright lights and were able to see the waterworld show from our room every night what a bonus the free shuttle over to universal was a bonus and never had to wait more than 7 minutes would definitely stay again and so much better than the universal sheraton which was just next door;5
stayed here with my family and really enjoyed it rooms were nice and it was close to universal studios glad there was a shuttle the staff were all really helpful and nice would definitely recommend it to others;5
first time in this hotel after a long flight it was nice to have a clean room for the night easy access into the hotel and a warm welcome this is typical of a busy airport hotel but it is very clean the restaurant is a good place to eat after a long journey but can be pricey but great service we settled for the buffet breakfast this was very good theres cheaper food on offer but glad to eaten before a long day ahead;5

great facility the staff was courteous and professional the room was incredible 55 television more usb ports and outlets than any hotel ive been in nice coffee bar mini refrigerator and nice view of lax very quiet as well the only reason i didnt give location an excellent grade is that traffic around lax can be a nightmare it is right at lax and the neighborhood is a good area just the traffic nightmare of century blvd and sepulveda blvd;5
everyone needs to visit the empire hotel bar and make sure to have frank as their server he has integrity respectful and so much fun he was so helpful and so kind i did not want to go out just wanted to hang out in this amazing atmosphere;5
spent two nights at hilton universal city in early march biggest draw of the hotel was easy of access to universal studios which is across the street with a pedestrian overpass although they also have a shuttle to the park available the hotel was very attractive and clean checkin was efficient and friendly in an attractive lobby online they had suggested their valet parking was closed due to the pandemic but it turns out that it was in fact operatingselfparking worked fine though bedroom was good sized well furnished and immaculate the room also had great blackout drapes if that is important to you hotel bar had friendly staff all the staff that we interacted with at the hotel were great and good drinks did not eat but the menu looked nice enough;5
i have stayed at the empire hotel three times in the last few months and have enjoyed my visit each time the location is excellent with easy access to the subway and many great restaurants and attractions within walking distance the staff could not have been friendlier when i had a problem with a broken minifridge on my second trip they replaced it immediately the rooms are large clean and welcoming i feel like the empire hotel is my home away from home;5

ive been coming to morningside for many years the value is absolutely incredible for the location the hotel is located on the upper west side of manhattan which is a very quite familyfriendly area of the city the hotel is just blocks for the 1 train so you basically have new york at your finger tips within a matter of minutesthe hotel itself is very clean and the hotel staff is excellent one of the best parts about morningside is that each floor is equipped with a full kitchen so if you are on a budget this is a great way to cut the cost of your trip as i mentioned before the staff at morningside is the best from the front desk to the housekeepers ive found the staff here to be extremely polite and helpful which makes the stay even better i would definitely;5
my wife and i stayed here for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay all the staff were helpful and friendly the pool is good the bar prices are reasonable the breakfast selection was fine the hotel was also a 5 minute walk to the metro the rooms were spotlessly clean although one or 2 places could have done with a lick of paint but nevertheless the hotel deserves a good review on the basis that for what we paid we got good value for money and had a pleasant stay;5
fantastic staff and service location is brilliant why stay anywhere else mention your planned days activities to a concierge or front desk they can really help with local information and ideas even if you know where youre going;5
ive stayed at many different hotels at lax and this one definitely stands out as one of the best the front desk representative acknowledged my hyatt status was extremely polite welcoming and efficient and left me truly feeling like a valuable guest the guest room provided a thoroughly noisefree sleeping environment and the shuttles to the airport were constant no need to worry about what time they left or how frequently they operated;5

just back from a week at the new yorker and loved it had two rooms a metro queen and a metro double double on the 37th floor with a fabulous view over the hudson giving us incredible sunsets both were perfectly adequate in size and we loved the art deco styling our rooms werent refurbished but they were clean and everything was in full working order there was a simple heatingair con unit in each room which we appreciated given it was a very unseasonable 80f and each room had a safe in the closet our beds were a joy to sleep in and i had no problem with the dated bathrooms other than lack of towel rails its called history if you want modern shower cubicles spa baths and discreet toilets go elsewhere wifi also worked perfectly in our rooms you have;5
i recently stayed here as part of a touring holiday to get a connection from la to cancun the hotel was ideally situated for the airport 5 mins with a shuttle provided as we had to be at the airport for 3am it was important we could obtain quiet and dark to try and sleep early it was perfect and the room service was timely and delicious highly recommended;5
this hotel is conveniently located in the midtown area not too far from time square and many other attractions hotel was very clean staff was extremely friendly the view from the room was absolutely amazing there was a cool little diner downstairs thatâs open pretty late so it was convenient when we got back to the hotel and need some extra food plus i was even able to buy some champagne there and take it back to the room i will definitely stay here again;5

we just sold our coop and we needed a place to stay for a few days my husband and i were very pleased the staff couldnt have been nicer especially zuli and nicole they called many times to check to see if we had everything we needed the housekeeping was excellent we especially liked the linenssoft but crisp chris at the concierge desk was very helpful and quite delightful we had drinks at the bar which was very nice but it could use a furniture makeover we will be coming in to nyc quite often for business and we plan to make empire our new residence;5

all the staff greeted me with a smile and made me feel welcomed and happy to answer questions or just share some of their local knowledge would definitely recommend this hotel the only little confussion is booking with all the fees but still worked out as a great value;5
i picked this hotel because of location and price it is not a luxury hotel but it was clean and surprisingly quiet definitely stay here again when i return to nyc i was upgraded to a room with an amazing view on the 35th floor;5
ive stayed here before and unknowingly that the hotel has done a complete overhauli booked because the price was still affordable for hollywood area only then was i surprised for a real treat when i got into my room and sawwow am i in the wrong place it almost feel like a 5 star the decor comfort amenities pillows and down comforters im good i was on first floor with two almost king size bed with immaculate sheets 4 pillows each bed and down comforters it has chaise with ottoman coffee maker similar to keurig refrigerator microwave iron safe which i didnt use toiletries that are more than you need and too much supplies of different sizes of towels only luxury hotels gives you these then my room opens up to like a patio that looks out to the gorgeous;5
after reading other reviews i fear people are missing the point of this hotel the decor in all areas from the lobby to the corridors is definitely of art deco influences what others are seeing as âoutdatedâ is merely the hotels choice of decor in line with the style and age of the building we were offered an upgraded room with empire state building views for 10 per night which was great the resort fees are all discussed with your travel agent when booking and are clear to see on the website so again unsure on why people insist on making that an issue we had a lovely stay here felt safe close to many of the must see sights of new york and subway station across the street;5
jerome at reception was extremely friendly extremely helpful and took care of us when we arrived a little early room was clean spacious and comfortable lounge bar had an inviting atmosphere and drinks served quickly overall enjoyable stay canât fault them;5
itâ´s important to me that the hotel looks good and empire hotel didnâ´t disappoint the front desk rudy in particular was very friendly and extremely helpful at all times with anything which we might need or wonder about we usually stay in other areas of manhattan and we were a little apprehensive about staying so far north but it turns out we need not have worried staying at empire hotel has actually just introduced us to a new area of new york the proximity to the park was fantastic as the weather was brilliant shopping was on the doorstep and cultural experiences just around the corner brilliant stay;5

i attended a conference with ef travel with a large group this hotel was hosting many large groups and handled it with ease during our stay we had a few issues with the room that we reported at checkout as we did not want to move we were in room 701 however iâm very confident that this room received the tlc it needed when we departed i was in the hotel industry for over 13 years and things happen in rooms ware and tear and general issues just like in any home what makes a hotel unique and special is their service every time i turned around someone was going above and beyond and had a smile and friendly greeting the breakfast crew and the bellman weâre all extraordinary but one stood out from all the others this is hard to do when everyone is already doing their;5
what can one add to the many superlatives already attributed to this lovely riad having travelled quite extensively and feeling equally at ease in a youth hostel with my kids or in luxury accommodations i can say that i have never experienced a place as welcoming rooms as inviting a staff as helpful as in this one fresh fruit in the beautifully appointed room bruschetta on the terrace with a declining sun over the medinas rooftops and above all staff members who seemed to discreetly appear and gently anticipate whatever might be needed throughly enjoyable unforgettable and with hopes to return;5

this was our second stay at the empire hotel the location is very convenient and off the major tourist routes located across from lincoln center and just down from columbus circle it is near two subway stations and within walking distance of central park you are two subway stops away from times square the hotel is a classic 1920s building with a beautiful dark wood lobby the rooms are a good size for ny standards with a small refrigerator minibar the staff is courteous and friendly and housekeeping had our room cleaned quicker than just about any other hotel that ive stayed at and im a frequent traveler the pool is tiny but the rooftop deck where it is located is really nice in the evening the same goes for the rooftop bar we will definitely be back;5
this hotel is in prime location for shopping next to harold square and macyâs every time we walked out of the hotel we looked up and you can clearly see the empire state building itâs like a block away rooms are remodeled very up to date beds were comfortable staff is amazing it is very clean some people mentioned no coffee pot in room so i requested it when i made my reservation and see the pictures i was stocked up with water tea and coffee;5

the perfect hotel for universal studios easily accessible from the motorway and with ample underground parking its 30 a day but as it costs you that to park at universal studios i guess you cant really complain the hotel itself is hugely impressive and our room was a fantastic size the staff are all incredibly professional and friendly and i was very impressed to see a filtered water machine where we could fill our bottles before heading out for the day an easy 10 minute walk up the hill and you are at universal studios and the same time down the hill brings you to the metro station and one stop from hollywood boulevard it really is the perfect location i had read that the walk back up the hill is tough and i dont doubt it but there is a universal shuttle;5
warning phone scam at hotel do not give any information over the phone this is not from the hotel but an outside person calling rooms and pretending to be the front desk asking to confirm cc details as the computer system has gone down on arrival great service considering the holiday congestion at the front desk stored luggage at no extra cost defiantly a great hotel for the price right on the red subway line;5

hotel is undergoing renovations and not all areas were complete but you can tell they are working on it our room was nice with an amazing view of the empire state building which puts on a light show at night with the peak constantly changing colors we came in on a train to penn station and it literally was about an half a block away subway was right around the corner the tick tock cafe was a neat 50s style diner that was attached to the hotel liked all the history they had on display in the basement staff was nice we could walk or take a short cab ride to time square and broadway shows;5
get away from the tourist areas of midtown and the over priced hotels the empire is a great alternative top location near columbus circle the park and across the road from the lincoln centre upper west side is a great location and has easy access to the subway rooms in the hotel can be a little tight typical manhattan but fine for a short stay if longer stay recommend upgrading to a larger room still way cheaper than midtown staff are great decor is cool downstairs bar is always fun as is the rooftop pool opens in summer restaurants abound nearby including the chowder house inside definately worth a stay;5

the jane is a nifty hotel in a great location the location on the corner of jane and west streets means that you are real close to all the action that goes on in greenwich village and the meatpacking district the rooms are small other people have commented on this but this is new york city and the only thing you need a room for is to sleep and how much room do you need for that the desk staff are very helpful and pleasant to deal with the restaurant is a slice of paris in new york and there are plenty of other options near by for me the only drawback are the oh so special people who crowd the street and lobby waiting for access to the nightclub they make the hotel guests seem like something they stepped in other than that i really like this hotel and will be staying;5

this was our first visit to california la and what a great hotel to start it from it is just a short walk from universal studios and city walk so a great base for visiting universal it is also just a little walk down the steep hill to the red line metro station that runs to hollywood boulevard there is a free shuttle bus that runs up and down the hill at frequent intervals we then caught a bus to the grove shopping centre â which is stunning then another bus to beverley hills the rooms were very nicely finished and kept very clean our room had good views of universal studios we did not eat at the hotel other than breakfast and evening reception snack but the weekend buffets looked spectacular and include a huge seafood buffet the outdoor swimming pool is;5

arrival was very smooth the lobby was quiet round 1300 so check in was very fast and we had wonderful service from mohammed who provided us a room on a high floor for city views and complimentary early check in as the room was available the room itself had everything we required although being a new york property it was small in size and very dated but the bed was very comfortable and we had a nice view across manhattan we didnt use any of the hotel facilities but were aware there was a gym in the basement of the hotel the only downside is being charged the service fee for using the property that i dont agree with and to make things worse on top of this the hotel also charge 5 per item of luggage for storage until heading to the airport later that day this is a;5

absolutely loved this hotel and defo wonât stay anywhere else when in new york was checked in by driss on reception who looked after our every need whilst we was there in fact all staff from the doorman to the cleaners were fantastic remember tho this is a old hotel with character so if your looking for up to date stuff this maybe isnât for you in fact it reminded me of staying in the empire state building which was built around the same time our room was 3615 and the view was amazing we could lay in bed and see the empire state building all lit up at night plus we could see madison square garden room was fresh and clean we heard very little noise from other rooms guests etc lifts were very quick and no waiting like some people have said on here tick tock diner is great;5
i actually visted in december of 2010 during a post christmas blizzard i was stranded in cleveland with the goal of making it to nyc on my first solo trip it was meant to be i was on the second flight out after spending the night in the luggage claim area i made it to the jane with some apprehension i was concerned about the unisex bathroom that all changed when i met the wonderful staff and saw how clean and cared for the whole hotel was the bathroom was no big deal everyone kept to themselves and it all worked out just fine;5
i had a great time staying at the jane hotel this is an inexpensive alternative to a hostel or one of the cheaper hotels this used to be a sailors residence most of the rooms are set up as little cabins as if you were on a ship this means that they are very small there is room for the bed and not much else however everything is immaculately clean and there is plenty of storage under the bed and along the window every room has a flatscreen tv extra outlets a fan a window and you are provided towels bathrobe and slippers and bottled water bathrooms are down the hall and the shower is a roomy waterfall type shower i never had to wait the one complaint i have is that the hallway smelled of old cigarette smoke possibly due to the older carpet but the;5

we spent 9 days in new york and wanted to be near lincoln center as many of our work events were there and the locationconvenience of the hotel is amazing there are great restaurants all around a starbucks and drug store on the same block as well as the subway very safe however what gives empire a 5star is their customer service we had to leave for a couple of days for work but knew we would return and they allowed us to store one of our suitcases at no cost so we did not have to take it with us most hotels charge you to store your luggage for a few hours while you wait for your room or when you check out but not ready to go to airport empire does not and the doormen are so friendly and attentive we definitely felt spoiled the gentleman at checkin named aj was so;5
excellent central location considering the reasonable price the facilities and staff exceeded expectations helpful and courteous doormen in particular saã­d who arranged at relatively short notice ground transportation to the airport as we had a helicopter tour on the afternoon we were leaving saã­d took great pains to assure us that he had informed the driver of our plans and therefore even if we were to be slightly delayed in our return to the hotel the driver would wait for us a huge thank you to all the staff at the ameritania for positively enhancing our nyc experience;5
we arrived a 7am and there was no rooms available so we stored our bags and enjoyed the breakfast buffet buffet was decent for price 23person lots of asian inspired food and varieties of yogurts but eggs and waffles were cold two mornings in a row bathroom has great mirror lighting and the bed was comfy great view of universal from our room on 17th floor nice piano bar at night with great bar snacks dont get the spring rolls they didnt taste fresh and came with frozen pre cut fries great location for walking to universal;5
forgot what full service feels like for the economy places we typically stay starting w concierge who quickly responded to an email query prior to arrival and other qs once there jesse harley knew his stuff and communicated it well the gentleman staffing the ticket desk guided us through efficiently using our time at univ studios the maintenance staffer took care of a super annoying dripping sound just outside my window shortly after i reported it so my next night sleep was undisturbed the server at the busy buffet restaurant was very friendly and efficient too pool staff too and as expected at a hilton rooms immaculate and nicely appointed lovely tile in bathroom walking distance to univ studios a nice convenience;5
my son and i stayed here during unified auditions for university theatre programs and the hotel was in the perfect location for that with the studios being only 12 a block away its also walking distance to broadway and times square and close to many restaurants of all levels of dining multiple subway stations are only blocks away if you need to go further afield we arrived early but were able to get into our room almost right away the room was a bit small but we had a nice view including the chrysler building the shower had reasonable hot water and pressure our room was free of noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms beds were very comfortable wifi service was free but a bit spotty in the evenings staff were very friendly and helpful there had been a;5
stayed here in april with my girlfriend honestly cant imagine a better hotel that we could have stayed in in the same price bracket we had a room on the 9th floor which was modern clean well decorated and had a great view of the lincoln centre and the hussle and bussle outside the location is great just a short walk from more than one subway station and 10 min walk from times square the nightclub on the roof is really good and residents get free entry and skip the queue which was pretty long all in all if we ever visit new york again which we definitely will we will be looking no further than the empire thanks for an amazing stay see you again soon;5
i needed to be in the area midweek not to go to universal studios for one night and stayed at this property the location is perfect if you need to be in that area though i arrived in the evening and checked in very quickly i had a room on the 10th floor that faced universal studios the room was fine with all the amenities one would expect from hilton i slept really well and i usually dont sleep well in hotels i had the executive breakfast in the restaurant and the spread was really good all of the staff at the hotel were great and i would gladly stay here again;5
i checked in to the ameritania after a horrible experience at a prior hotel the manager matthew checked me in and could probably sense i just had an unpleasant experience when he asked me how i was doing and i vented he magically took all my worries away and assured me i was in a much better place and it was exactly that he made my check in extremely smooth assured me my room was taken care of showed me the bar area and even gave me a complimentary drink card to enjoy during my stay as much as i want to rave about the cleanliness and decorthe staff really made my experience so pleasant from checkin to checkout everyone was so kind the door guys were helpful with my luggage matthew was topoftheline and during check out two women were just really;5
i cannot say enough nice things about this place although we had a rocky start they have certainly done their best to make things right the first night of our six night stay we realized we had no hot water so the next day the bellman moved all of our things to another room with a fantastic view which unfortunately after a day lost the air conditioning its an old but beautiful building im sure these things happen however i was not happy about moving yet again management had a bellman come up at 1130 pm to move all of our belongings to a suite overlooking broadway we were given breakfast and drink passes and housekeeping even came and made up the sofa bed for my daughter so she didnt have to things happen mechanical breakdowns are common no matter where;5
all the staff are extremely nice and helpful but i would like to specifically find out neida she helped me to get all the amenities i was looking for and once the extra mile to help me dress up the room to surprise my wife also bernice was extremely helpful and giving me clarification and making sure i got the right room and altogether piece of mind a very pleasant experience;5
i stayed here for a couple of days with some of my friends i liked the fact that it is so close to the airport but even with its good location they still offer a free shuttle service to the airport it is also close to the beach area itâs about 20 minutes away from redondo beach which is good considering the la traffic the lobby interiors are modern and very pleasing to look atgood for taking pictures too checking in was seamless our room was on the 6th floor it was clean and was very minimalistic front desk and the staff were very helpful i had a couple of requests and all were attended to in no time parking was 30night with in and out privileges which i thought was reasonable overall it was a pleasant stay i would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting;5
we spent a total of 8 nights in this little slice of heaven the staff all go above and beyond to make your stay unforgettable elaina sara were awesome to work with us during our stay to ensure everything was perfect the entire staff was so impressive with their kindness and professionalism i loved the location its in a quiet nook of the medina and its absolutely gorgeous the riad was so clean the breakfast and mint tea were delicious we had several other meals as well and we enjoyed them all i love the attention to detail that is given to make each guest feel like family we dream of being able to one day revisit i literally had tears roll down my cheeks as our experience came to an end in this mysteriously beautiful city thank you riad kheirredine for leaving;5
weve just spend 5 wonderful days in marrakech and riad kheirredine was a significant part of making this so pleasant the friendliness and hospitality of the staff has been 2nd to none always welcoming you with a warm smile and a genuine down to earth care and interest for other people in this place you can find seclusion from the busy streets of marrakech the surroundings are impeccably kept so you feel pampered at all times this is truly a home away from home we cant wait to visit again;5
from the moment we were picked up from the airport until we were dropped back 5 days later i can honestly say that this was the perfect experience and could not have wished for anything more from everyone at this riad when we were greeted at the hotel we werent just shown to our room but given our own tour of the place and were made to feel so welcome the local sights were shown to us on a map and even a phone was provided to us for the duration of our stay in case we got ourselves lost in the maze of streets so that one of the staff would come and find usamazing when one day we werent sure which way to go to leave the inner city the hotel provided someone to show us the way and put us in the right direction nothing was too much for them the room was out of this;5
my partner and i stayed here for a week in january and could not fault it the doorman was very friendly and welcomed us with a smile everyday the housekeeper was also very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for her great place;5

just got back after staying 7 nights to do the nyc triathlon then sight see location on 106w on central park is fantastic with nearest subway a very short distance away on 103w only downside is lack of free room wifi many guests congregate in the foyer where it is free however i discovered that that free wifi is easily obtainable at subway stations museums and many attractions i requested a room charge to one at the front overlooking the park and this was promptly done with no fuss i returned later that afternoon to find my luggage installed in the new room the 7 day unlimited travel subway metrocard at 32 is a must if staying for that duratiion otherwise one must keep charging your metrocard as each trip is charged at 275;5

beatifully finished and recently expanded this riad differs from most in morocco in that it is run by three young italians rather than the more typical french expat there is an unusually large and attentive staff who do everything to put visitors at ease including guiding newcomers to and from the riad and major destinations in the medina they were also unusually solicitous about health issues asking about allergies with no prompting and offering to pick up medicines at the pharmacy other nice touches included equipping guests with mobile phones and leaving fruit plates throughout the hotel for the guests;5

we planned a family birthday weekend in universal for my little girl and we decided to stay at the hilton next to the park i really wasnt expecting to much from the hotel except for a place to sleep after the park the room itself wasnt all that great it wasnt a bad room but it was a little ordinary for the cost the view from our floor was amazing we had a clean view of the park the view was enough for me to justify the cost what made it an exceptional trip was what they did for my kid my wife let the front desk know that it was her birthday and if they could do something for her when we returned from our day out we were surprised with a hand made birthday card signed by multiple strangers this was amazing enough but they also delivered 6 chocolate covered;5

i stayed here with a friend for five days the location and the rooms are all very good theres an excellent service that lets you order movies through your tv what really separated this hotel from the other places is the amazing breakfast hugo was great;5
i spent six nights at the ameritania hotel and i am very pleased with my choice of hotel it was quiet clean and from there it was a short journey everywhere staff was helpful and jeff is the king there were nice bars and breakfast places in the immediate vicinity of the hotel;5

we are in morocco for 2 weeks and started our trip at the riad kherridine i was celebrating my 50th birthday and we couldnt have asked for a better location it is as fantastic as other reviews have mentioned with a special highlight being ismail whos directions were indispensable we liked the fact the riad was a bit further from the main square with the walk there being an interesting part of the day it was also nice to get back to the calm after a mad day in the soucks valantina was a wonderful host she were happy to chill some champagne we had bought and also presented a lovely bouquet of roses with the birthday breakfast we will definitely return;5
perfectly located next to the london eye and within easy walking distance of most of the theatres and shopping districts room spacious clean and tidy staff welcoming breakfast second to none the bonus is being able to leave suitcases at the hotel pre check in and again after check out thus being able to roam the city bag free the staff were all friendly and welcoming giving the impression that they like working there would highly recommend and will definitely stay there again in the future;5
we had an overnight flight connection out of lax the shuttle picked us up and delivered us back to the airport in a timely manner the front desk staff made us feel welcome and they were extremely pleasant the bar had very good drinks and food the room was clean and comfortable;5
we drove to nyc and from the moment we arrived to the time we departed staff at every level and every station were friendly and helpful our room was comfortable and room attendants were always ready to assist we appreciated the central location the convenience for both walking and subway and the overall value of staying at the new yorker we will surely stay again;5

most friendly and helpful receptionist ever so lovely and great first impression of hotel couldnt have been more sweet they ensured me my car would be safe in the parking lot the three angles went beyond the call of duty by helping me print important documents that i needed for an impotant event that i was attending fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional and i dont give praise lightly it was clean stylish roomy with excellent service room itself was well equipped and comfortable i was very pleased with my stay and although short and sweet this time i hope to be back for a longer visit in the future just want to say thank you again to the three angels at the front desk;5
first of all the location cant be beat i grew up in manhattan and know the neighbors this one is my favorite for ease of going anywhere without the density further downtown the hotel building is old but after staying there over a dozen times i can honestly say it sure is comfortable and the staff is great;5
we stay 5 days at the ameritania and we loved it great modernminimalist rooms and style best location and the doorman jeffery could not have been more friendly and helpful everytime we saw him we would atay again for sure other perks were blackout curtains and minimal noise from the street and others in the hotel;5

stayed for holiday excellent location very clean and well run mezzanine area with seats to relax read or do some work away from main entrance breakfast not good value however but many nearby places available try the smith across the road;5
convenient to the airport and providing shuttle to and from the hotel made it worth the price staff was extremely friendly and helpful surprisingly you could not hear the airplanes or traffic in the rooms;5
firstly the hotel has a good location i love the west village the hotel building is very beautiful and has a helpful concierge personnel the lounge looks pretty cool also i stayed in a cabin the room was very clean cozy and very quiet it had a lcd ipod dock free local phone calls and a fan the shared bathroom was also very clean of course it hadnt any view and is was very dark but if you are looking for a clean very cheap and well located place only to sleep its just perfect i love this hotel and i will for sure come back;5
i rarely review hotels or restaurants online but i feel particularly moved to recommend the riad kheirredine in marrakech our honeymoon there was exceptional from start to finish and really showed moroccan hospitality at its best hakim francesco khalid and all the staff took care of our every need with a genuine smile offering us outstanding service in the stunning surroundings of this traditional moroccan riad we stayed in two different rooms during our four nights there and while the second verveine was a gorgeous room at a higher rate even the more modest room sandal was charming and very comfortable the roof terrace is the perfect spot to unwind after a day at the souks and our hammam and massage in the small hotel spa was just what we needed after a long day;5
booked our first stay at the empire well in advance and wouldnt you know flight cancelled due to weather last minute scramble dead of night and both simon fernandez the mgr and jose galiano on night duty at the desk were fantastic helping outshuffling rooms during a soldout block even managing our room upgrade and making sure we had a suite with a bathtub as we originally requested great corner room with three windows and plenty of space to relax and yes take a good hot bath both these gentlemen were extremely helpful as well as poised during a storm that delayed tons of flights and must have turned their reservation slate upside down tried twice to shake their hands in person but our crammed schedule never coincided with either of their shifts so saying thanks to;5
i stayed at the hollywood hotel with 3 friends in march 2017 when we arrived the checkin staff were very friendly and helpful they broke down some 100 notes for me and were happy to advise regarding the local area and local sightseeing as none of us had visited la before the rooms are extremely spacious and spotless and all have balconies the bathroom while it could have been slightly bigger was more than fit for purpose maid service was daily and efficient the buffet breakfast has a large selection of fresh food and they will cook to order pretty much anything you want the hotel does advertise its courtyard bar as being open at certain times however when we went down during this period there was no one to be seen so its probably worth checking with reception;5
great and fast check in mylka was such a wonderful help with touring and sightseeing had great hospitality such a sweet person i hope to have a wonderful trip and enjoy sightseeing and will recommend the jacuzzi suite for couples;5
was a bit reluctant when i went online as the price was so low for nyc but was very pleased as was my husband to find such a lovley well cared for room and imminities at lincoln center location we were quite shoked the linens were wonderful very plush and upscale as were the bathroom toiletries the room was quite spacious if you know ny or paris accommodations with down pillows pillowtop down comforter underneath egyptian sheets and soft fluffy duvet cover very well appointed and wonderful staff cant say more about it just amazing in nyc;5
this hotel is literally a short walk across the street from penn stationoff the train from boston and minutes to our room literally minutes from times squarest pats cathedral to namer a few numerous restaurants in the area as well;5
this hotel is a must when visiting universal studios with 3 kids under the age of 6 the walk took us just under 10 minutesits so close we didnt bother waiting for the shuttle the rooms were clean and comfortable but what made our stay was the water bottle filling station in the lobby what a great touch located right next to the gift shop where bottles of water are sold the filling station is a huge money and waste saver;5
this property is a really good price and in a great location if youâre visiting universal studios hollywood or universal city walk staff is extremely friendly and the rooms are very clean we liked the refillable water station downstairs love the shuttle service to and from the hotel to city walk stayed here for the inaugural universal 5k and they ran shuttles especially for the runners at 4am so thank you;5

i researched over forty riads in marrakesh narrowed it down to five and emailed them all with our requirements riad kheirredine was one of only three that replied and the only one that did so within an hour flurries of emails to and fro later and i was convinced this was definitely the place for us they arranged a mountain tour through berber villages in the atlas mountains a guided tour of the souk and booked us in at the in house hammam their welcome face to face was exceptional nothing was too much to ask everyone was very welcoming and smiling the food is excellent my only complaint was the desserts are all very sweet and were too sickly for me but that is the moroccan style the hammam was wonderfully relaxing and we loved the amazing scenery in the mountains;5
this was my sons and my first trip to new york the staff was great the room and view was amazing special thanks to kader and jennifer at concierge desk great advise on how to see so much in such short time and where to get some great pizza cant wait to go back again thanks for making this a special trip for us;5

me and my girlfriend stayed at the empire hotel for 3 nights the hotel is located in a great place in the center of manhattan and next to all the main attractions of the city and if its not close enough you have a metro station nearby the best thing in the hotel was the great staff when we arrived to the lobby bar we met mor she was so kind to us we had a little chat and she even helped us with directions in the city and recommendations for restaurants and bars nearby next day she even remembered to ask us how was the place that she recommended on day before and if were enjoying our stay she definitely made the difference for us in our stay;5

we stayed with friends at the ameritania the weekend before christmas the hotel was clean and the room quite large for nyc my only complaint is that the building is very old and while it has been renovated it seems there are some structural issues floor sinking 5 inches from baseboard in some areas which caused a slight bit of uneasiness nonetheless we thought the room was very clean the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job and the hotel was conveniently located we would stay here again;5
walking distance to universal studios hollywood there is a heated pool hot tub and individual kazeboo hotel restaurant offers good breakfast but a bit pricey there is a peets coffee inside hotel elevators are not enough for guests you may need to wait a while to catch one overall its a nice hotel for family vacation and we will return in the future;5

we stayed 4 nights and really liked it the location is perfect our room was nice and large for nyc we loved the roof top bar and went their twice you do have to make reservations which was no problem the pool was not opened which was no big deal the hotel itself is really cool and has a vintage look to it some areas are dark so the lighting could be a little better but honestly no complaints would stay there again for sure;5
rooftop lounge experience this past friday night on august 19th we were waited on a charming man from osrael who said he was working as an intern in accounting he helped the bartender that evening and answered our every request we asked for frank sinatra music and he put the cd on right away so we could do the the foxtrot and swing wow he delivered our food and wiped our chairs off after the rain and made sure all was perfect a very accommodating gentleman indeed he checked back with us to see if we needed anything else too he also made conversation with us and took our pictures upon our request great to be dancing on the rooftop but this gentleman abramson i believe was his name made it the best thank you kimberly page;5

people who read my reviews know that i tend to separate the character of the property from the management because one can excel while the other is weak and vice versa an average of the two would provide little insight to travellers about which elements are strong one of the pleasures of travel is that every once in a while you come across a property that is truly excels in both and whose process of weaving the property with their attention to detail lends itself to a truly unique and satisfying experience experience riad kheirredine is that kind of property the owner has over time integrated three riads into one with 19 rooms and an abundance of space and experiences the property is much like others an integrated complex of rooms hallways stairs terraces;5
everyone was so awesome we arrived to new york on an early flight the new yorker stored our bags so we could enjoy the city while our room was getting ready i wanted a room with a view so they were so gracious to put us on the top floor and boy what a view you could see everythingi had hurt my knee while out and about in the city the man who checked us in listen to our silly story and when our luggage arrived to our room he had ice packs for me so super nice of him to do without even asking they where so accommodating all the staff was so nice omg the tick tock cafe was so good so nice having it in the hotel;5

stayed at astor on the park with my 16year old son from the 10th to 16th july please donât be put off by the negative reviews as the astor exceeded our expectations and proved to be a really pleasant hotel with friendly and helpful staff yes the rooms are a bit on the small side but we didnât spend a lot of time at the hotel leaving first thing in the morning and returning late evening to crash out we had room 407 overlooking central park and the noisy aircon and subway below didnât bother us at all however if 5 star luxury is what you are after then the astor may not be for you but if you are looking for a clean and safe place to stay away from the crowds downtown then you should definitely consider this hotel located on the upper west side at the north west;5
the room was great it was spacious and comfortable it was also very clean the amenities were great the breakfast they had there was delicious perfect hotel if you are going to universal studios bed was very comfortable;5

stayed at the hollywood hotel with my girlfriend for 14 days and sadly my vacation came to and end but i have to give a lot of thanks to the hollywood hotel for making us feel at home the staff is the most friendly helpful and professional staff ever they know all the trendy places in los angeles they make you feel like a vip all the time it was a pleasant feeling knowing we were safe at the hotel one of our favorite staff members was pil it really felt like he was always at the hotel he never missed giving us a smile of a hello no matter what was going on at the hotel the breakfast here is amazing but there are also plenty of local hot spots around the hotel if you want to have a variety ask the front desk they know all the places the pool was definitely one of;5

this was my second visit to new york but first to this hotel the room wasnt very big but was clean and comfortable the staff were very friendly and willing to help and not expecting to receive tips those who helped us the most were said jeff mourad and matthew we had a problem with the aircon in our room but matthew got it sorted very quickly with the minimum of fuss only two negatives and they are very minor one is the breakfast only a continental available however it was the use of paper plates plastic cutlery that i didnt like the other one is that there is no teacoffee making facilities in the room overall we had a very enjoyable stay;5

we had a great stay staff were nice location was great however the best part of our stay was the housekeeping they paid so much attention to detail even arranging my contact lenses our room was always spotless our least favourite part was the tick tock diner iâm afraid food was not great male servers very abrupt however there was one nice lady overall our stay was great though thankyou again;5
i was in la for five nights for a convention downtown but since my wife was along we decided to stay out in universal city the hilton was less expensive than the downtown hotels and really could not have been much nicer everyone from the doorman front desk bellman room service to housekeeping staff was very friendly helpful and polite the room had a great view of the universal city walk and you could look all the way down the hollywood freeway and see the city skyline when the la haze cleared the room had a huge tv refridgerator and safe the bed was just how we like it universal city is located at the top of a steep hill the hilton is also near the top of the hill so the walk from the hotel to universal is not too bad but if you want to go down the hill;5

we had one night in nyc and wanted a comfortable stay i first saw the empire hotel on lastminutecom but found that it was cheaper to book through the hotels official website when we arrived they let us park our rental car outside the main entrance for quite some time while we checked in and got changed the friendly service also continued at the checkin desk where jerry upgraded our room and gave us wifi for free we had a beautiful view and a comfortably sized room the ac was a bit noisy though the location is great next to the lincoln center and close to the park the empire hotel is very good value for money;5
on a recent trip to ny we stopped into the empire hotel to have an afternoon beverage we were served by andrea bartender in the lobby bar you could not ask for a better bartender a ginger jalapeno martini was created for me and it was phenomenal andrea was personable warm and very customer service oriented i dont always take the time i should to write reviews but this experience really stood out to me dont pass up an opportunity to have a drink there;5
great location just beside times square broadway and a very short walk to central park hotel is lovely and clean lots of amenities including free tea coffee in the morning staff are friendly and very helpful our room was a little tight but all are in nyc with handy storage spaces bed was very comfortable the shower very powerful noise not an issue as couldnt really hear much at night if anyone was going to nyc id recommend here in a minute and if i was going back id definitely stay here again perfect;5
okay so i had read the reviews on here before i booked the hotel and i have to admit i was dubious but at that price we couldnt afford to turn this hotel down we had a very good experience at this hotel it was very clean and believe me i was really looking the room was spacious and had ac a refrigerator tv and phone ill admit the hallways and lobby etc dont look particularly enticing but the room itself more than made up for that sharing a bathroom isnt exatly ideal but over the 5 days i didnt have to wait once to use the bathroom the bathrooms were also very clean and the showers were hot powerful really fine the staff were really friendly and extremely helpful one in particular came to our rescue when our airport pickup shuttle didnt arrive;5
we had 2 nights and chose this hotel for easy proximity to universal studios approx 40 minutes drive from lax and 510 minute walk across the road to universal studios city walk we had room 1166 overlooking the studios good size room little dated in style but clean comfortable the buffet breakfast was superb and meant we didnt need lunch 23 dollars each children 10 so not cheap but something for everyone used the concierge to book a shuttle to anaheim staff very friendly and polite good all round;5
having read the bad reviews on here about the hilton at universal city all i can say is i think myself and those people did not stay at the same hotel from the moment we arrived to the last day we left everything was faultless this includes the amazing view we had from the eighth floor of the hollywood hills in a lovely clean and comfortable room to the helpfulness of all members of staff including the concierge team luis was in particularly helpful to the cleaners would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others the shuttle bus from this hotel to universal studios was brilliant arriving every 15 minutes or so which drops you right outside the studios and citywalk and is available from the same drop off point to take you back to the hotel whenever you are ready i;5

i arrived at this hotel half way through my holiday it was totally unplanned to stay here but the service in the other hotel was a disgrace as i didnt plan on this stay i could only afford a standard room with one bed which i found great it was just very small for myself and my sister and all our stuff typical women overpacking and shopping although the room would be great for a single traveller the comfort of the bed was great i did notice that the sheets werent changed daily though but thats only a minor complaint and could probably be resolved with a phone call after 2 nights the room was starting to feel a bit cramped so i went down to reception to ask for an upgrade a guy called mr ze was very helpful he offered us a complimentary upgrade which;5

myself and wife stayed here back in may for 5 nights to celebrate her 30th birthday the best thing about the hotel is its location it is right opposite madison square garden we had tickets to a basketball game whilst there and penn station so due to the metro system youre only minutes away from anywhere in the city we either caught the subway or walked everywhere we must be the only people to visit new york and not use a yellow cab 5th avenue with all its shopping times square the high line central park etc are all walking distance from the hotel our room was pretty standard bathroom could do with updating but who spends much time in their room when visiting new york for us the location made this the perfect hotel for us we used the tick tock diner a couple;5

lets start off by saying that i absolutely loved the empire hotel on my recent trip to new york i had the opportunity to stay at both the empire and another hotel that we will not mention here the empire was by far the superior choice what had originally drawn me to the empire was the responsiveness of their assistant general manager joe i saw that he was very active in responding to guests here on tripadvisor and you just do not see that very often it seemed like he really cared about the guest experience and was willing to go above and beyond in order to make sure the guest had a great stay and that they were satisfied with the hotel that turned out to be very true and i have to say joe really over delivered for me on this particular trip within minutes of my;5

i love this boutique hotel very charming and close to wonderful restaurants it is in a very noisy area of nyc there is no getting around this the hotel is worth it would love to come in summer and see the rooftop pool and bar my only complaint would be the water bottle wrapped in a bow like a gift next to your bed that costs 800 it should be in the minibar box like the rest of the snacks and drinks you might want to buy you will love your stay here;5
the hotel was beautiful and all of the staff professional and friendly my ten year old compared it to the type of service you get on a cruise ship the location is the best if you plan to do universal studios there is a shuttle that comes by every 15 minutes or so but we just walked as it only took about 5 minutes it is a little uphill though the kids enjoyed the hot tub and heated pool there was a large area with cabanas available the hotel restaurant had great fooddrinks they had an awesome looking buffet but we did not end up eating there upon checkin we received a text from a service member and we were able to request a crib via text which was convenient since we were out and about highly recommend this hotel;5

wow the location of this hotel is incredible walking distance to universal and whatâs even better is the city walk we spent most nights in city walk which took a few minutes waking to get to there are lots of shops and restaurants here buy your universal tickets from the hotel reception as they are slightly cheaper than in the park itself the rooms are very big as are the bathrooms we overlooked the freeway but the rooms are fully insulated so it wasnât a problem we also got around cheaply using âlyftâ for all the other attractions in the area warner bros studios griffith observatory hollywood the only attraction that is a mission to get to is disney land around 110 round trip we did eat in the restaurant once good quality food fair prices and good;5

i travel a lot for my job so hotels are not usually that impressive to me but this one was exceptional in so many ways the lobby and bar area are super hip and there is a great little food beverage shop right in the lobby in addition to the very swanky bar area every detail has been attended to in the contemporary decoreven the lighting my stay was too short to experience the fitness center but i heard its got a great view from an upper floor most importantly to me the rooms are not only very updated but impeccably clean for once i did not immediately feel compelled to pull out my travel sanitizing wipes also very important despite its proximity to the airport the room which was actually facing the runway was almost completely quiet the beds are enormous;5
nice pool convenient to airport was able to accomodate an extra night since our flight was cancelled ubers were plentiful to take around the area brought extra towels to us nice little snack area with salads etc;5

great stay only 4 blocks from times square and 2 blocks from empire state building minutes to penn station;5
conveniently located at the heart of times square and within reach of several broadway show theaters ameritania hotel is a great place to stay if one considers to be very near these nyc attractions surprisingly despite the busy and bustling streets of nyc room was very quiet and helped provide a good nightâs sleep also commendable were the rain shower was not able to take photos and fantastic bathroom amenities recommending this hotel for tourists who prefer to be very near to the sights and sounds of times square but would like a little peace and quiet amidst the bustling busy life of nyc;5
nice room on the 33rd floor with view of empire state building large clean 2 bedroom great mattresses and lots of pillows easy checkin close to blue line a c e security at elevator across from madison square garden;5
we booked this hotel for its proximity to universal studios its as close as promised with a short walk or a convenient shuttle to get you to and from what surprised us though was the outstanding level of service we thought this would be a fine hilton but it has a true resort vibe and personnel always ready to help the pool area was a nice surprise with pretty landscaping and a terrific view the hotel is convenient to burbank also a trip in for dinner took us less than 10 minutes the walls are a bit thin and we did hear some noise from neighbors on one side however we loved it and wed stay again;5
we had two night here and our experience was perfect thanks for your attention and quality service that one of the nice things we enjoy the area and the room with our time here next time we can choose this place again;5
this hotel was everything i imagined and more i loved that it was right across from lincoln centre and the subway station was just across the road it is very centrally located however so the subway wasnt necessary unless youre going further out of the city times square is a 15 minute walk central park 10 minutes so its got everything the rooftop bar was so cool you cant go up there unless youre 21 though even if you want to look around we stayed in a deluxe room or something like that and it had a little sitting area and everything which was nice because most nyc hotel rooms are very basic the mexican restaurant around the corner has the best guacamole ive ever tasted the room itself was very clean and the housekeeping staff kept us well stocked with;5
our stay was amazing at this riad perhaps our favorite in morocco the service was exceptional everyone who works there is attentive to guests needs we were appreciative of the constant stream of snacks and tea the breakfast was outstanding as well the only drawback was the size of the orange room it is beautiful but too small for the money that being said we were still very happy with our experience;5
the hotel is well centred and ideal for a touristy manhattan stay the staff were lovely especially jeff who was on the door for most our stay gave us lovely pointers and was an absolute gem would definitely stay here again;5

location is outstanding and it doesnt stop there very clean and very affordable and that staff was so kind the rooms were decent sized and very clean housekeeping every day and they even let us print our theatre tickets really lovely people and the hotel is closer than we thought it would be very close to penn station to anyone coming from newark airport right at the side of all the main attractions a lot quieter than i thought it would be given the location the staff were very helpful and nice and the location of this hotel is perfect just a 5 minute walk from all major trains it was great i would recommend to someone who does not mind being in small room;5

the people the ambiance and the location of this hotel is just amazing itâs close to basically all the touristy areas and main subways ie times square central park broadway rockefeller etc the one thing that also made this hotel the best and most comfortable was the customer service rajiv sedik and jazleen have exceeded in their level of thoughtfulness and truly showing how much they care for the people that stay at ameritania they are very welcoming and answered any questions that i had i cannot thank them enough for being so caring and thoughtful to us i would highly recommend staying here;5

great stay this hotel is in the best location minutes from hollywood right across from universal and very close to everything else worth visiting the hotel was clean the staff friendly and the pool heated the rooms were large enough that i did not feel cramped with a family of four in a double room the breakfast buffet was pretty pricey but the bar happy hour was a great perk the dinner and brunches were set up in the walkway which was odd and we walked through the lines to get to the parking garage there was an awards dinner when we stayed and our kids got to see some of their favorite tv stars starbucks in the lobby a plus dont bother with the shuttle city walk is a 5 minute walk tops;5
the location is top the rooms are clean the staff is super friendly especially ham thileli glenny and magdi we had a lot of fun with them and they helped us whenever we had questions moreover the wifi is fast and free water is always available we werenât searching for a luxury hotel and our expectations were satisfied and we were absolutely happy;5
if you are worried that the reviews for the riad kheirredine are too good to be true dont be it really is amazing fantastic staff service rooms facilities and food marrakech really can take the first time travellers by surprise and it can feel over whelming till you acclimatise but the riad kheirredine is an ideal oasis away from the storm an afternoon on the roof terrace is so refreshing after a day of figuring out the maze of the medina all the little touches such as welcoming talk mobile phone and fantastic staff add up to a truly welcoming stay tried both the moroccan meal and the pasta if you like something a bit spicy the pasta with chilli is amazing we went away for 2 nights on a tour and the riad couldnt have been more helpful coordinating with the tour;5
hotel hollywood was awesome the rooms were very clean had a fabulous breakfast every morning not just cereal and muffins but they will cook your eggs to order right in front of you how ever you like them scrambled over easy omelet with bacon onion cheese etc beautiful pool area and outside seating area too chill in march to swim but we sat by the pool in the sun looking forward to visiting again;5

i booked this stay to surprise my gf the service before our arrival was splendid the people at riad kheirredine went above and beyond to help you organise trips and their communication was very clear and friendly to make sure we had a good arrival and stay if this is your first time visiting marrakech then we advise you to definitely book with this riad they realy make you feel at ease during your stay for example they always offer you a guide to walk you through the small streets of this beautiful city further the rooms are lovely and well decorated the breakfast and diner are delicious upon our return we already advised multiple colleagues friends and family to visit marrakech and to stay at this true pearl in the heart of the medina;5
we were so happy with our 3 night stay at the empire hotel the staff were super friendly and helpful and got us checked in immediately with no problems we had a superior king room on the 9th floor which was clean quiet and had all the amenities that we would need the shower was amazing the temperature was fine in our room something i was concerned with having read previous reviews there was a coffee machine in our room but we only found out that it was complimentary on our last day weâd assumed it was charged like the minibar maybe a sign to say that itâs complimentary would be a good idea the decor is stunning like the oppulance of the 20âs something i adore rather than the clinical feel of more modern hotels we had drinks in both the lobby bar and the rooftop;5

we stayed at riad kheirredine towards the end of our stay in morocco from the 14th to the 18th june the staff from the riad were on hand to collect us from the bus station as we were arriving from essaouira our driver dropped us as close to the riad as was possible via car and then another member of staff was on hand to walk us to the riad which was about 5 minutes away on arrival at the riad we were greeted by staff who showed us around and made us feel extremely welcome as we had been travelling all day we decided to eat at the riad that evening and what a meal it was it was so good that we decided to eat there again on our last night if you like traditional tagine and lots of it then its a must our room was fantastic there was everything we needed and both me and my;5

we spent 4 nights staying at this wonderful place recently and cannot fault anything with the riad at all from the moment we arrived to the time we left we felt the service provided by all at riad kheirredine was 1st class and we felt so at home lounging around on the many chill out areas on the terraces we had a lovely time staying in marrakech and would love to return again soon thank you to all at the riad for making our stay in marrakech a special one;5

thanks to maria and everyone else at riad kheirredine my husband and i had an excellent time coming back from the merzouga desertto relax in marrakech the service is absolutely first class i arrived with a cold and they immediately went to the pharmacy for me and got me some medicine which was wonderful they gave us a cell phone in case we got lost and had someone walk us to certain location points to make sure we knew where we were going every afternoon they would send up some tea or any other drink you might want to your room after youve walked around the busy streets of marrakech we had dinner on the rooftop our first night which was delicious but i recommend they consider getting some heat lamps as its still quite cold at night in february the breakfast is;5
this riad was the epitome of luxury and high class service the location was excellent in relation to the medina but the riad itself is an absolute gem within it the service is highly personalised they cannot do enough for you and every item in the hotel exudes beauty and class food was outstanding with a strong wine list all round an excellent location to unwind for a long weekend;5
this hotel is totally awesome we were pleasantly surprised particularly in light of some of the not so great reviews because we travel a lot we know that reviews can be skewed depending on the person and their experiences we are glad that we gave empire a chance the room was great we stayed in a king jr suite to get the view we were not disappointed and the roof top restaurantbarpool areas were very relaxing with wonderful views and they stay open late additionally the staff was very accommodating we will be booking this same hotel today to visit our son in law school in september;5
while we had some typical issues with dinning very slow service and room service food prepared wrong and tasted awful the front desk staff made this hotel the only one we will ever stay at in universal city we have an autistic child and needed to be close to the park having planned our trip late the hotel was booked they worked hard to get us a room by calling us when a cancellation happened we stayed 3 nights and our child really benefitted from being able to walk back to the room with us when he needed quiet;5

we arrived at the hotel it was a very posh looking hotel the interior was decorated lovely and the lobby was lit by candles such a relaxing atmosphere the staff were all very helpful and friendly our room was very nice but abit too small and the air conditioning unit did not seem to work therefore it was very stuffy and hot the view from our room was the view of a vent outside not the best view of new york but were not fussy and compain alot so we were fine however we did complain aout the air conditioning as it was too unbeaurbly hot however the receptionists were very nice and handled this issue the rooftop pool looks big on the internet but in real life was rather small the roof top waiterbarman was very rude demanding a tip but we did not have any small;5
arrived 2 hours early if check in it was me and my 13 year old daughter receptionist immediately put us at ease and assured us that we could check in she didnât charge us for early check in and she also upgraded our room free of charge the view on the 32nd floor was amazing and lying in bed at night you could see new york sky line and it was so pretty room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed it is an old hotel but this added to the charm and character which we really liked housekeeping staff were on hand every day to clean and freshen up room nothing was to much hassle it was in a central location and had everything you needed around the hotel;5

i have a choice of where to stay while working in area the first stay was in july and was flawless easy the location however was a challenge but no different then what you experience is you are staying anywhere else there is a theme park as the neighbor what sets the hilton staff apart is service issues are resolved immediately and essentially in the spirit of making things right i have witnessed the hotel manager working along side the valet guys when the hotel was super busy and am greeted as if they all know me when i arrive from the first face you see to the front desk and all the services in between if you are vacationing or a business traveler like me i can and do recommend the universal hilton as the place to be great food too that rib eye is so good the;5

we stayed at the new yorker for 5 nights and i cannot say one negative thing about it upon arrival we had a seamless check in and received a room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine for our anniversary our room was spotless and had everything you would need from fridge to safe to ironboard etc and were cleaned every day on the 21st floor you could hear some noise from below but not enough to be annoying but hey it was new york and it added to the experience the adjoining diner and restaurants are also unbelievable and great for any meal at any time there is a gym but didnât get to use it i had a look though and it is also pristine again i cannot fault the hotel or its staff and the security when going to the lifts is a nice touch for your safety the;5

iâm going to have to write this review on the basis that you understand what being within the walls of marrakech means with regard to access and moving about the hotel is fantastic they will meet you at the airport and take you to the hotel well close to it â see note above the rooms are all individual and very tastefully decorated thereâs no tv in the bedrooms but there is one in one of the dining rooms that had sky tv coverage of the formula 1 and premier league football on the breakfast just keeps coming and the service is without fault there are lots of little cubby holes that you can sit in and have a cup of tea english style or a beer we ate in the hotel on two of the three nights we were there and they did a local dish one night and an italian dish on;5
from the moment i arrived at the front desk to breakfast the next day the staff could not have been more helpful hugo who mans the breakfast station is always so welcoming each morning thank you to all for making my stay so enjoyable;5

its not often you find a peaceful place in manhattan certainly not one away from traffic noise sirens and subway rumbles but astor on the park is peaceful calm and serene the hotel faces the northwest corner of central park as its located directly on central park west and even if you dont get a view of the park youll still get a quiet nights sleep the rooms were clean and well equipped the shower was incredibly powerful and the bath filled quickly should you need one the bathroom on the whole was incredibly clean and the main bedroom area was equally well maintained with a comfortable bed amazing pillows a radiator cupboard drawers and 2 chairs there was also a large amount of mirrors we arrived early for checkin and the room wasnt quite ready;5

i love this hotel its really nice and the location is perfect the rooms are small so if you want more space book a suite ive stayed here 3 times and i will definitely be going back its close to the park and its pretty central;5
we love the standard of the hilton hotel and book the executive style rooms as they offer a little bit more for the travelling family the position of the hilton los angelesuniversal city is perfect you can sit in the comfort of your room with a magnificent view of the city or universal studios its located a very short walk to universal studios on a well lit walk way or catch the trolley and a quick train ride and youre in hollywood the swimming pool is great and easy to find bar staff were a little disappointing as they tried to charge us for more drinks a pity we still had all the glasses in front of us management sorted this out though;5
i have only stayed at a few hotels in manhattan but have been coming here for 13 years this is by far the best hotel i have stayed at the elevators are so fast the decor is very cool so many places to sit and relax and visit with your group in the lobby at the end of the day the location is a little away from the hustle and bustle of time square which i appreciate but its so close at the same time love the close proximity to the subway and starbucks the price was also more reasonable than other hotels i have stayed at would recommend this place very highly;5
great staff food and rooms very happy with everything and everyone who worked here the 24 hour complementary airport shuttle was always available nice pool with cabanas was clean and excellent will definitely use this hotel next time we travel to la;5
our stay here was so good we have booked to come back in spring in 2016 we felt so relaxed here we ended up spending most of our trip to marrakech at the riad inside the riad i hadnt ever stayed in a riad and was very interested to experience staying in one on arrival after our taxi transfer we were greeted at a drop off point a few minutes away by a staff member who walked us to our riad through various winding narrow streets past some ancient looking doorways to various other buildings and riads en route when we arrived at our riad we were welcomed warmly by valentina who gave us some nice tea an orientation and a mobile phone with instructions to call her day or night before we were shown to our lovely room we noticed the whole building smells great on the way;5
it is a really nice hotel and close to pretty much everything in manhattan the room is a bit small but that is pretty ok for new york more important it is clean and the bar is awesome makes me feel comfortable when i think about staying here for 10 days;5
we stayed here for 5 nights a family of three with a two year old included in the party firstly do not be put off from booking this hotel as i had some concerns following recent reviews on this site we took a superior double room there was lots of space for storing our 5 cases and buggy room was well cleaned every day beds are really comfy all rooms have air con so you can adjust your own room temp one incident occurred due to the poor behaviour of another guest hotel staff dealt with this within minutes offered another room and complimentary meals please note this was a one off incident and totally beyond the hotels control however they resolved it swiftly with regards to security we had no concerns at all room safe dead bolts fitted to doors and no concerns at;5

we asked to change rooms because we thought we were given a smaller room than we had bookedthey changed us willingly after our first night the bathroom was difficult pt behind the door with little knee space and inadequate counter space for toiletries;5
been staying at empire for 25 years on and off always friendly helpful staff starbucks in same building for that morning coffee run during bad weather you like that it is so close i had an upgraded room that was a joy to stay in for 3 days not all rooms are that big but that is true with many ny hotels across from lincoln center so the area in front of hotel is open and less crowded than most hotels always 1st choice in this area;5
i stayed here with my wife to take wedding photos we started taking wedding photo tour from the hotel hotel staff permitted us to do and they gave us great present when we came back from the photo tour and came into the room we found wine bottle and plate to congratulate our wedding with strawberries i really appreciate their present i would like to stay there again;5
stayed for 10 days in this wonderful hotel i have zero complaints the room was large with 2 double beds very very clean modern decor comfy beds blackout blinds curtains windows that open the room was fitted with everything we needed morethe bathroom was well stocked had 2 shower heads handheld rain we were on the 12th floor across from the elevators which i thought would be noisy but was pleasantly surprised some street noise can be heard early in the morning sometimes late at night but this was expected this as we are in the heart of uptown the location is perfect for walking subways restaurants theatre shopping and sightseeing the staff was the best part of our stay always professional and at your service at the front door jeff was super;5
the jane is probably one of the most valuable hotel right now at least from my experience in ny the service is excellent all staff friendy and always ready to assist even if the rooms are small buy who will be in ny to sleep and there is shared showers the value of the hotel is in the service and the staff one simple example instead of standing waiting for your taxi take a drink in the neighbor bar and the staff comes and get you when the taxi has arrived another example is that the baggage storage including alia me stuff get stored at the office;5
so first of all this hotel will give you the true nyc spirit you crave when you imagine your trip to this wonderful place dont bother spending on the other overpriced hitech hotels its just a place to lay down your tired beat up body after a day of bingeshopping and eating anyway i live this hotel so much its busy and buzzing all the time but in a good way every member of the staff will greet you every time with a smile and a little word not once did it feel forced you can see the pride they all take in working there the stay was already magical as it was but the big surprise at the end made it unforgettable we forgot to book a shuttle to the airport 24hrs before leaving it was raining so catching a cab was impossible the legend is true the hotel offered us;5
my family stayed at the new yorker for cosmopolitan new york fashion week and loved the vintage charm of the hotel security was top notch at the elevators and our family loved the restaurant on site hotel rooms were a little small but that is expected in new york location is fantastic with the subway and restaurants and starbucks all nearby along with shopping shopping and shopping;5
at first i was having a lot of commication problems after booking 2 rooms for us and our family coming from uk to america for the first time i finally dealt with the night shift manager and then his boss dell i was so frustrated with all the communication problems and after addressing my concerns they reassured me everything would be just fine during our stay they went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant my family from uk loved the hotel and everythzing was perfect thanks to dell and i want to sa andy was the other gents name the rooms are very nice and clean the housekeeping personnel were great and pleasant the hotel has a lot of history behind it they have a diner called the tick tock which serves great food and good service i would recommend this zhotel;5

i stayed at this hotel with my family last march for our spring break trip we loved our stay here i loved the art deco style exterior of the building the hotel lobby was beautiful this hotel was in a great location we could see madison square garden from our hotel window the rooms were very spacious compared to what most new york hotels offer i couldnt believe how reasonably priced this hotel was considering its great location in manhattan easy walking distance to many great tourist attractions and districts i also loved learning about the history of the hotel and many of its famous guests including muhammad ali and nikola tesla i will continue to recommend the new yorker hotel to my friends and family and i hope to return soon;5
iâve just come home from a stay at the new yorker and can highly recommend the location is perfect just on 8th and 34th so beside penn station train and subway station so access to all part of new york is really easy the room we booked had 2 double beds and was so spacious as soon as we entered we could smell how clean it was and the housekeeping was brilliant every day not all rooms will have an amazing view of course but ours did we could see the edge and the hudson lobby staff check for room keys before allowing anyone to pass by the main entrance so safety of guests is well considered all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful had a 24 hour diner attached which is a huge bonus all things considered we loved it;5

we came into penn station on the train and only had an overnight layover we opted for the new yorker hotel because of its proximity to penn station as our train left early the next morning the hotel is conveniently located about 1 12 blocks from penn station when we entered the hotel the staff was very friendly welcoming and willing to help with whatever we might need the room was clean well supplied and the view from the balcony was amazing;5

we stayed at the empire for 4 nights in february the hotel was in a great location just 10 mins walk from times square spitting distance of central park and various other shops and restaurants in the area the hotel was really nice clean and modern only problem we had was the room was really hot we ended up sleeping with the window open and dealing with the new york city noise my boyfriend proposed in central park during our stay at the empire staff member uri on the concierge desk went out of his way to arrange a few little surprises on returning back to our room as requested by my boyfriendnow fiancã©e uri also arranged for us bus tour tickets empire state building tickets and a helicopter tour of manhattan we loved the fact the hotel had a few different;5
this week my husband and i stayed in new york for 4 nights the first night we stayed at another hotel that we had booked for our whole vacation it was horrible and disgusting and took us an hour to check in we canceled there and came here instead and it was wonderful janet at the front desk was so helpful they checked us in early had free wifi for our stay and they stored our luggage for free and then brought it up to our room the hotel is very clean and very swanky the one bed rooms are a little on the small size but have great views and have everything you would need we are planning another visit for next year and we arenât even looking at other hotels we will be staying here again;5

new york is so big that i wanted a hotel close enough to walk to the broadway theatres carnegie hall a subway station and central park ameritania hotel was perfect for me i was by myself so the small room was not an issue it was clean and serviced daily the front door staff were efficient and helpful and a big thank you to jeff on the door;5
experience was wonderful and location to citywalk as well as universal studios was wonderful i enjoyed having room service be available to me as during our trip i got ill the location is beneficial to additional dining as well as shopping;5
i stayed at the jane hotel last weekend in manhattan the bellhops met me at the curb and helped me with my bags and the checkin staff was great and even let me into my room a few hours early when i got up to the room the elevator is a bit slow i admit i was shocked at how small it was but then once i realized that i would be in this room for a few shorts hours each day from about 3am to 9am i figured who cares how small it is it still had ac a tv a bed some shelves a bathrobe slippers a huge mirror and drawers the bathroom down the hall was constantly being cleaned and best of all the showers and toilets had complete privacy behind a locking door the bar on the first floor was a wild scene every night but up on the 5th floor i wouldnt even know it was;5
we had the good fortune of having this hotel included in our bcs package we did not know the treat that awaited us from the very first moment we we treated as longawaited family members the view is wonderful the rooms are fantastic the service is second to none right down the street wlking distance is the universal party town very convenient for a little offsite entertainment;5
weve stayed here several times everytime we have a fabulous experience the hotel is beautiful and the food is great shuttle tofrom airport and near car rentalsthis is an excellently placed hyatt with a great staff;5
we had four nights in the hotel at the start of august i love the fact that it was the gossip girl hotel although the only reference to that now is a chuck bass cocktail which paws a little disappointing for a big fan we had a superior king room and it was really lovely and spacious something thats quite unusual for ny the checkin at reception was quite slow and there was lack of communication between reception and bar staff at the pool regarding happy hour drinks but the concierge was excellent eds chowder house is super too the hotel is really well located and i can highly recommend it;5
this is my first stay at the empire although i have eaten at the fabulous eds chowder house several times before performances at lincoln center the location is perfect we walked in central park shopped at columbus circle and the met was a quick stroll across the street the room was very minimalist but comfortable the staff really makes this hotel special thanks to romeo and everyone else who helped make our stay so pleasant the empire will be my new york home away from home from now on;5
its clean accessible and simple to get to where i need to go for me the customer experience is what sets this place apart pil who has worked the front desk on several occasions when ive visited goes above and beyond;5
i now know where iâll be staying when i visit nyc in the future i canât imagine staying anywhere else now after having stayed at the new yorker it was gorgeous clean and everyone was very kind friendly and professional;5
the hotel not only gets my memory for being memorable but the staff as well i had the opportunity of staying here with my husband on our anniversary and can not say enough about the wonderful service i experienced especially josna at the front desk her dedication to ensuring that not only your stay is satisfying but her concern for your wellbeing just makes it so surprisingly refreshing;5
i had read very mixed reviews on the hotel but decided to stay there anyways hotel itself is very nice see photos i uploaded room was very nice and my bed was very comfortable had 2 good sleeps breakfast time was good always lots of food and the fresh made waffles and omelettes add to the experience the grounds around inside hotel property are very clean and present to use room and bathroom also clean to my expectation the area outside of the hotel at night can be a bit scary but fine during the day close to shops in case you forget or need anything stuff at that hotel very pleasant to deal with very friendly on check in and check out i would recommend the hotel to anyone i would also book again if im in the area we had a car and;5
if you are visiting marrakech particularly for the first time stay here to say that we received excellent customer service doesnt really capture how well we were looked after rather it felt like we were being warmly and genuinely welcomed in and cared for but never in a way that was intrusive the riad is located within the medina with fabulous views over the city and is an easy walk to the souks and jemma el fna the staff insist on walking you into the city or to anywhere new for the first time and even as relatively experienced travellers it is wise to take up their offer as other reviews have noted valentina also provides you with a mobile phone to call the riad staff any time day or night if you get lost or into any trouble whatsoever nothing is too much;5
very centrally located clean and quiet i loved how big this room was compared to other hotels in nyc right across from madison square garden we will definitely be back it was a great experience overall;5
stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday reception staff are lovely especially the lovely krystle in fact all the staff we spoke to where so very helpful and friendly location is really good rooms are lovely with the comfiest bed ever the coffee bar guy was really friendly in the morning and saves you going out to get coffee as its right there in the lobby security in the hotel was very strict as having to show your key before getting into the lifts tick tick diner food was awesome especially the pancakes i would most definitely recommend this hotel and cant wait to return;5
we have been coming here for years best value in manhattan great location and service very friendly well staffed theyvgobiut of there wayvto accomodate your needs continental breakfast is a great addition if you have a car the public parking is validated and price reduced from anout 60 to 40;5
having stayed at the new yorker on several other occasions i was not surprised at the exceptional customer service we experienced from checkin thank you miguel for the smooth transition to checkout our room on this particular trip was an executive suite which is located in the corporate section floors 7 or 9 with no view although we typically prefer a corner suite with a view our options were limited at booking and i cannot fault the property having the subway station blue lineace trains at the corner helps considerably since the weather was wet windy and quite cool the central location to the city makes navigating simple and finally the tick tock diner is usually the tiebreaker if we have other properties we are considering for our stays in ny;5
this hotel was a very pleasant surprise nowhere near as big as some of the hotels near times square that weâve stayed in and all the better for it rooms were a really good rate and location wise thereâs a subway stop right nearby itâs walking distance to times square and thereâs a sports bar right next door we paid a small upgrade fee for a more premium room and were rewarded with a higher floor little traffic noise to be heard and a corner room that was larger than the norm with three windows letting in a lot of extra natural light great size including the bathroom comfortable bed the huge full length mirror was much appreciated hotels so often lack those we didnât make use of any of the other facilities bar the complimentary tea and coffee on offer every morning;5
we spent a wonderful week here in february and we were so impressed with the hospitality of the staff they could not do enough the comfort and cleanliness of everything amazing breakfasts and superb dinners drinks of mint tea whenever we wantedincluded was a marvellous massage and hammam and free laundry every day marrakech is a pretty mad place and it was so good to return to the friendly haven that is the kherridene to be pampered and to relax a big thank you to all the wonderful staff who made our stay so perfect ðð;5

from the second your driver pulls up to the curb on arrival til jeffs loading your bags and bidding you farewell ameritania staff go above and beyond from the fun and friendly bar staff whos cocktails are spot on served in front of the fireplace to the doormen day and night desk personally and housekeeping your given the added touch of class and decadence the rooms are small for my tastes but im used to staying in some of the larger rooms offered in times squarebroadway area that last minute trip afforded little more than a round of drinks on the house while were in town but apologies already being booked up id recommend ameritania to anyone for a reasonably priced hotel prime location and classy time in nyc and make friends with jeff the ultimate;5

third time to nyc first time at this hotel one block to the west of central park lovely restaurant at the property and several places across the road roof top barrestaurant was stunning even had a smoking area very rare in nyc;5
my teenage daughter picked the empire because of its connection to gossip girl and while i initially had my doubts the hotel has a very exciting feel the lobby area is buzzing with activity it has a bar lots of comfy sofas and free wifi so its always filled with people having coffee using laptopsipads gossiping with friends at night people queue up outside the hotel glittering sparkling in their finery waiting to get into the rooftop club it all adds to the sense of being someplace special the room itself was on the small side and the bathroom was minuscule but it was beautifully decorated and my daughter was in heaven with the assortment of empirebranded items available to buy inroom a small housekeeping problem we had was quickly and efficiently sorted out;5

i stayed in a cabin room on the 6th floor at the jane for 8 nights in august 2011 i was traveling alone to nyc for the very first time and had a wonderful stay at the jane it was the perfect place for me as a solo traveler because it was inexpensive compared to other options but you get great value for your money yes the rooms arent much more than a bed and a bit of space to put your stuff but if you are in new york city why would you want to spend time in your hotel room other than to sleep the staff at the jane were all very polite and happy to do what they could to make your stay wonderful the bathrooms are shared but they are frequently cleaned and i never had a problem with their cleanliness or having to wait to use one brushing your teeth in the morning;5

we stayed here in oct 2015 after previously staying at the san carlos we had decided we wanted a decent size hotel room like we had had previously and booked the new yorker executive double room we got this at a good price considering the location and size of the room it had 2 queen beds and was a large room disappointed at the fact we had no real view apart from the back of the building but that was a small inconvenience the staff were very professional but not warm and friendly nice location mcdonalds is just across the road handy for a quick coffee and breakfast to take back to room and also a cinema and five guys is very close by as well duane reade is just a hop away which was handy for the band aids i required for my blisters after all the walking i did;5
this is the most incredible riad and better than any hotel i have stayed at from the moment you step into the riad we were welcomed by the friendly team not only is the riad a beautiful and relaxing space the service and friendly staff is exceptional the reception staff are always willing to help they had great touches such as a member of staff to walk you to the main road they provided a mobile phone to text the team and the cleanliness of the rooms the team at the riad feel like a family and genuinely seem to enjoy being there i cannot fault this place and i will definitely stay again and recommend to all my friends who visit marrakech;5

this hotel is lovely ð the staff were always on hand to help with any questions the rooms are clean beds really comfy the bonus was a little note and some chocolates wishing me a happy birthday location is excellent just round the corner from times square with nice restaurants and broadway with the theatres the only small niggle was no tea and coffee in the room but we had air conditioning when i did the research not all hotels have this and you need it i would highly recommend this hotel didnât want to check out;5
very nice people to deal with which can be hard to find in nyc rooms were very clean and bed was comfy definitely will recommend this place to anyone i know traveling to nyc the taxi fare to from times square was reasonable if your not interested in trying to figure out the subway system and central park is literally right across the street;5
last night for the third year in a row our nonprofit organization held an event at the empire the staff bent over backwards to help in every way possible to make it a success a fantastic group of people who are committed to quality service kudos to the empire;5
we loved this hotel nice views large rooms wish they had a microwave and refrigerator in them that would have made them perfect it is a couple of blocks from universal studios but they have a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes we bought front of the line tickets and considering the crowds it was well worth it we had a great time;5
flew in to newark and got the train to penn station which is 2 mins from the new yorker hotel checked in by mohammed who gave us a room on the 30th floor which has just been renovated we knew this as when the lifts opened up on the other floors the carpets or flooring had not been changed and the corridors looked a little tired cheers mate the room was clean and had a great view there was only 3 of us in it that was ok but any more and it would have been a squeeze staff were happy to deal with you and checking your door card before u can use the lifts is a great idea their are also plenty of lifts so u never wait more than a minute or 2 new york is right on the door and the location was brilliant;5
i stayed here for 3 nights with my 2 12 year olds the place is very clean the staff is very courteous friendly and helpful we got a free upgrade upon arrival and had 2 double beds on the 17th floor with a view of universal the beds were very comfortable and i loved that we could walk to universal there is a bridge that goes from the hotel to universal but you need to ask the staff how to get there its kind of confusing if youve never been there before the walk is 7 minutes from hotel to universal we did take the shuttle a few times but it would have been faster to walk we ate at the hotel for breakfast at the coffee corner where they have starbucks coffee and muffins danishes and donuts we did eat one meal at the buffet they have at the other;5
my wife and i were here for three days and will definitely be back next time we are in new york we flew over from ireland for st patricks day got an upgraded room because it was our honey moon to a fantastic room with an excellent view hotel staff were so friendly and helpful especially john who worked at the guest relations desk one of the nicest men i have ever met he sorted us out with all we needed even got us a taxi when we were leaving and personally carried our bags out for us would definitely recommend this hotel for a visit;5
this marvelous historic hotel with great service made it easy to get to all the nyc sites we wanted to see our room was small but we didnt spend that much time there so it didnt matter easy access to subway system short walk to time square and show theaters;5
what a wonderful surprise to find this gem of a hotel located right across the street from lincoln center my suite was absolutely lovely and the staff could not have done more for me the bar was great room service was prompt but the food was mediocre and that is the only thing that was not totally perfect about my stay i highly recommend this hotel to the most discriminating traveler recently completely renovated and in one of the most convenient spots in manhattan it offers a flawless experience;5
the single rooms are tiny the beds are smaller than a twin size bed there is space to store your luggage shelf above the bed large drawers and space below the bed the hotel and room was impeccably clean the carpet in the room was impeccably clean a pet peeve of mine as my feet are sensitive the hallways and entire hotel was impeccably clean and extremely elegant the staff all of them were nice cool and friendly i arrived at 10am to store my luggage as checkin time is 3pm the hotel desk checked me in early i was very pleased right away another plus on check in was the complementary bottle of wine they give you i am not a drinker but it is a super nice touch i asked for a quiet room and they gave me room 420 which was very quiet the shared;5
we had one night in la before having to catch a connecting flight the following midnight i was unsure where the best place to stay would be that would occupy our time after checkout while waiting for our flight all without a car the hilton was spectacular for what we needed out of it the location is so close to universal city walk where there were plenty of restaurants and entertainment without having to even go into universal studios we walked there in under 10 mins at night and it felt very safe but there is also a shuttle bus provided by the hotel this hotel is also about a 10 min walk to the red line station after being given a late checkout we left our bags with the porter and we were able to catch the train to hollywood and highlands and spent the day seeing;5
i stayed here overnight with my husband and two kids great accommodation and the location is very convenient one employee that stood out was nancy she helped us with all our needs and made us feel right at home we will definitely be coming here again;5
the hotel itself is beautiful and huge with a pool and whirl pool open from 530 am til midnight coffee corner selling starbucks and great pastries as well as nutella ice cream there is a gym lounge area restaurant and piano bar the first person we met was roger who checked us in he was efficient polite and funny he was also a rock music fan which was cool after our check in we found our room to be big and comfortable the location is perfect just a few minutes walk from universal studios or free shuttle bus if you prefer the hotel is only one tube stop from hollywood boulevard too everything is great about this hotel and if i ever visited los angeles i would not stay anywhere but this hilton;5
i had a meeting in new york city i come from a small town in the midwest i was out of my element to say the least the staff was outstanding and extremely helpful the location was great walking distance to several restaurants bars and half a block to the subway i stayed on the club level the room was in perfect order and had everything i needed;5
the hotel was perfect for our needs the only complaints we have are ones that cant be fixed so we wont even mention them our room had a perfect view of the empire state building and times square the location was fantastic we will be staying here on our next visit;5
i stayed here for 4 days for the governors ball after reading a lot of reviews i was skeptical of staying here i am glad that i didnt listen to them the front desk was great and the hotel is nice it has a great roof top restaurant the rooms are not as small as you would think they were clean and the beds were comfortable you also cant go wrong with having a pool at your hotel to beat the nyc heat no matter how small it may be i would stay here again;5
we booked this hotel primarily for its location to universal studios only about 8 mins walk to the theme park entrance and universal walk it was excellent for access the hotel itself was what you would expect from a hilton hotel big corporate well maintained clean and efficient check in and check out was very smooth and easy room was spacious and well equipped bathroom was very large and bed was comfortable sofa bed was good for kids not so much for adults we did not use the on site restaurant as it was a bit expensive and there was so much extra choice at universal walk the coffee kiosk on site was pretty well stocked for a quick light snack or breakfast the swimming pool and hot tub were nice with free pool towels and convenient barsnack area negatives would be;5
i want to thank the hilton for kevin and jerome two amazing individuals who makes peopleguests feel like they are the only in the entire hotel they not process the checkin process efficiently and caringly they also make sure throughout the guests stay is special they were very professional but personable and hospitable i have been an hilton honors member for a while and currently a silver elite status still working my way up and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of the prestige of the brand the location amenities and also more importantly because of the way kevin and jerome made my family feel;5
excellent and helpful staff bellboy checkin restaurant bar could use a bit more seating and tables in general lobby area appears newish and modern very quiet room starbucks in lobby excellent dinner via room service would definitely return;5
from the outside this hotel doesnt look like much but the moment you get inside the warmth of the hotel will embrace you decorated in rich chocolate and gold tones it feels very welcoming we arrived really early after a red eye from la and our rooms werent ready they held our luggage while we went shopping and when we returned around three our rooms were ready they had upgraded us to king suites which were huge by ny standards to say thank you i gave the staff on the front desk some tim tams and they gave us free internet access for our whole stay which was awesome and unexpected staff was very helpful throught the stay the bus boy even got a cheap car service in to take us to the airport seeing our exorbitant amount of luggage we had no external noise at all and;5

we love this hotel it is our new upper west side favorite we had a spacious junior king suite which was a corner room with two large windows it was beautifully appointed and comfortable with a king bed and sofa and two chairs we enjoyed the roof top bar and small plunge pool as it was a very hot weekend the lobby bar is very classy and we enjoyed drinks there we also had a wonderful breakfast at eds chowder house it is a great location near lincoln center lots of retail and a starbucks next door we will be back;5
i cant really fault the hotel great value for money it is in a ideal position very warm rooms with airconditioning if needed the reception staff are friendly and helpful however covid made the visit a little hard work with the constant mask wearing there was low noise level considering where it is positionedi am its only drawback is no kettle in the room although your surrounded by macdonalds on every corner you had to get dressed to get a hot drink;5
hellowas a perfect experience and quality of service for everythingthe view are impressive and easy way to visittrainfeet and bikethe city are incredible and amazing perfect for visitthanks;5

was really impressed with this hotel lovely big room breakfast was complimentary so was just expecting pastries and fruit etc but there were omelettes waffles and cooked breakfast available too really helpful staff especially a lady called fanny location was good a few minutes walk from the metro station and you could get to almost anyway from there you have to pay for parking which is the only downside but then thats the norm at all the hotels in the la area has a swimming pool but we didnt use it as was so busy with everything else la has to offer would definitely recommend this hotel;5
this was a short weekend trip with my wife everyonedepartments front desk valet restaurant bar and housekeeping we came in contact with were excellent the hyatt regency la just like its name indicated is very close to the airport and rental car return;5
one of my best hotel experience ever just to mention few friendly professional and very helpful staff excellent room service very clean and well designed bathroomshower large rooms double insulated windows makes the rooms very quite and relaxing prompt response by the hotel staff and engineer to fix a technical issue thanks to all of you;5
we stayed here for 10 days 23rd dec 2016 to 2nd jan 2017 the staff were amazing the room was clean a little small which is normal for ny not much counter space in bathroom only concern is that the bathroom doesnt have extractor fans so the bathroom and bedroom windows got very moist close to everything view of chrysler building empire state and madison square gardens was a treat stayed in room 2137 which was great for 4 kids and 2 adults i was given champagne and a voucher to tick tock diner for my birthday awesome hotel and service if they could have a kids room that be great in wet weather to entertain them;5
no idea why there would be a lesser rating from top to bottom this hotel is great in my travels i have stayed at many a hotel the empire is at the top the staff and hotel are incredible the swanky vibe is sheik and awesome made this traveler feel very special;5
the riad had fantastic staff that were extremely helpful in navigating the medina and assisting in anything we wanted to do while we were there they even gave us a cell phone to take with us in case we got lost in the medina which was very comforting the breakfast spread is great the rooms are a good size and clean there new spa was lovely and it felt like the true hammam experience great stay and would definitely go back;5

the new yorker is a classic art deco hotel with all the amenities of a new building great customer service perfect location in midtown manhattan comfy bedding clean rooms great view of the city and night lights were wonderful will stay again and recommend to friends and family the adjoining tick tock diner was convenient and yummy;5
we fell in love with this hotel it is beautiful and filled with stunning details throughout comfortable luxurious and located a short walk to just about everything we were hoping to see the staff was friendly and remarkably helpfulâthe best service weâve ever experienced at a hotelâand made everything so easy for us it can be a confusing city to navigate but they walked us into town gave us a cell phone to use with maps and phone numbers preprogrammed in and called in reservations for us at amazing restaurants i would highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to marrakech and would recommend you travel to marrakech to stay at this hotel;5
i love every corner of this hotel they kept it well clean and organized the staff are beyond helpful and so accommodating with our every needs breakfast is amazing great selectioni recommend eating breakfast at the rooftop i would live in this hotel if i could definitely miss the tea time i cannot wait to come back;5
this is a great hotel you canât beat the location but it is the rooms and amenities that are the real star the rooms are modern comfortable and well appointed they really have a high end feel also if you get a high enough room you will have a great view the staff was extremely accommodating and the hotel has a lot to offer multiple restaurants a large store onsite shuttle to universal great pool etc i really have no idea how some other recent reviews questioned the accommodations i found them first rate this is by far the best hilton i have ever stayed at donât hesitate to book here;5
i have stayed in many hotels guest houses in a number of countries riad kheirredine puts most of them to shame the staff is very friendly and professional they are always willing to help whether for restaurant recommendations reservations or arranging for a taxi or advice and insight to local culture the location of the riad is outside the craziness of the souks but still within the medina so you get the flavor of the old city rooms are spacious and quiet itâs easy to oversleep the great breakfast which you can have in room in the courtyard or on the sunny terrace will get you ready for a full day of exploring but it all relies on the friendly caring staff i canât recommend this riad highly enough;5
i stayed two separate days in one week in two separate rooms i cant say enough about how clean and beautiful the rooms were im a hilton honors diamond and travel extensively this has been my absolute favorite hotel this year the staff is what made the difference from the front desk breakfast housekeeping and concierge this definitely met hilton standards i will be back again in august and looking forward to another stay;5
we stayed for one night whilst visiting hollywood the room was very clean and the beds were very comfy secure parking down below and it was only a short walk to universal studios we didnt have breakfast but universal city is only a walk away;5
we got a corner room on the 9th floor with the view facing universal studios which is pretty nice i read the review on here before so i knew that they will have the shuttle bus to studios that is very convenient the bus runs every 10 minutes we drove our car there so we have to pay for parking i didnt realize that they also charge city tax 10 on top of your parking charge so 28 28 so you will be paying 308 per day for parking luckily on the day we checked out we were still going to the studios so i asked to leave my car there after the check out they let me leave it there till 6 pm which is pretty nice so i didnt have to pay to park at the studios overall the place is nice and clean and great location for universal studios visit;5
after spending time traveling from san francisco and wine country to los angeles via the pacific coast highway we spent the final leg at the hilton los angeles universal city the view was exceptional the pool is terrific although it could be 5 degrees warmer but the jacuzzi was perfect universal studios and citywalk are within walking distance but the shuttle was super convient warner brothers and paramount studios are less than 20 minutes drive as is hollywood blvd the hotel food was excellent as were the accomadations bed room;5
amazing place with simply wonderful staff that cannot do enough for you from the moment you arrive up at this riad you are welcomed by all members of staff in a way that is rarely seen these days an informal chat over a mint tea in the courtyard of this beautiful riad is just the beginning of the great service that this riad provides having stayed in raids before in marrakech i was always impressed the by the warmth and friendliness of the riads in marrakech but riad kheirridene is up another level run by people who genuinely want your stay in marrakech to be wonderfuland memorable elena and danella as with the rest of the staff could not do enough to ensure our stay was as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible what impressed me even more than the level of customer;5
we absolutely loved the jane it is such a beautiful building the staff is amazing and the location couldnt be better we stayed in a double captains cabin on the second floor on the jane street side noisewise it was peaceful and we were never aware of our neighbours sizewise it was pretty small but manageable the bathroom was really nice with a surprisingly big shower the location couldnt be better right by the high line with loads of great bars and restaurants within stumbling distance cafe gitane on the ground floor makes wonderful coffee the staff was without exception professional and friendly you couldnt ask for better when i left half my wardrobe behind the head housekeeper really went out of her way to get my clothes back to me thanks kittie we also;5
like so many earlier reviews our experience at the riad was excellent we also booked this riad based on tripadvisor reviews from the moment i started email communication back in the uk to the day we left marakesh we couldnt fault the service it was a special anniversary treat for four nights and all the staff at the riad made us feel speciali usually name a two or three of the staff for dedication but its impossible to name all the staff in my review they were all dedicated professional and nothing was too much trouble if you want a real taste of the medina look no further its location is great for accessing the main tourist spots we walked every where as the riad provided a phone in case we got lost yes walking in the medina is daunting but the staff give you;5
we had an amazing stay at riad kheirredine and cannot recommend it highly enough the concierge arjane treated us like family and there was no problem we had that she did not try to solve she arranged excursions guides touktouks and taxis for us â all with a positive attitude and warm smile we have stayed in hotels all over the world and it is rare to find such topnotch service the accommodations are beautiful and comfortable we found lots of places on the terrace to lounge in the sun in the shade or by the pool the friendly staff are always eager to bring you whatever you can think to ask for they provided us with a local cell phone to contact them if we needed help when we ventured out into the city if you are lucky enough to get the opportunity to;5
very friendly staff clean room and close to times square a fantastic art deco hotel the metro rooms are small but nearly all rooms in nyc are small so dont be put off by this lovely comfortable beds;5
jeff is the man professional courteous and helpful he made our trip enjoyable if youre looking for a clean and reasonably priced hotel in the middle of things this is your place the shampoo smells really good;5
what you would expect from a hilton this is the place to stayright next to universal studios;5
we got upgraded to a suite which had a balcony with views of the empire state chrysler freedom tower and everything in between simply beautiful aside from the view and the extra space that came with the suite the staff was amazing specially mohammed at the front desk also i really appreciated all of the measures they are taking for covid very pleased with my stay i will definitely be coming back;5
exceeded our expectations take the airport hotel transfer great views of the atlas mountains from the terrace all the staff were really attentive but not overly so food was great beer and wine available the rooms are very individual and spacious try for one near the terrace always use the hotel guardian service when returning later at night great location in the mã©dina very close to souk;5

the new yorker is an iconic hotel in midtown located roughly equidistant between empire state and hudson yardsedge and a block from macys and penn station there will be other more luxurious hotels with arguably more modern facilities but i would always go back to the new yorker as being friendly comfortable and a wonderful piece of art deco new york history walking into the lobby is reminiscent of returning to the heydays of 20s and 30s new york and it is easy to imagine resplendent ladies and gentlemen attending dances in the ballroom rooms are very comfortable if a little tired at the edges but clean very comfortable beds and good working order and everything you need for a short stay staff could not be more helpful and when you can walk no more the location next;5
my husband and i stayed here on our first trip to new york i was amazing the lobby is breathtaking like walking into a trendy lounge the rooms where large and clean with modern decor and our room had a great view of the fountain at lincoln center the location is great just a couple blocks from central park close to shopping and great restaurants time square is a quick walk but if you prefer the subway there are multiple stops all within blocks this hotel is a must for first timers or veteran visitors;5

thanks at jalal who give us many good advice and being really nice to us he was really helpful we are appreciated all the staff are nice thanks very much it was my second time in this hotel and itâs always a good moment near to everything 10 min walking to time square the only bad thing itâs about the noise in the hallways with the doors slamming many times early in the morning itâs annoying anyway except that itâs was a really good place;5
found the hotel excellent great history to it tesla lived here for 10 years close to time square opposite madison square garden and subway can see the empire state building really close by only downside if your irish no kettle in room or fridge for the cup of teað and the taxes were a bit much â¬120 dollars per room for five nights;5

stayed two nights and were very happy with our stay centrally located 2 blocks from penn station and walking distance to other areas such as chelsea and rockefeller center lobby could be a bit of a zoo but no problems checking inout also liked being able to store our bags several hours after checking out due to a late flight the rooms were clean and quiet cvs right next door was also super convenient for snacks or anything you may have forgotten;5

it was a 3 day trip hotel is very chic lobby is gorgeous they have a rooftop barrestaurant very cool rooms were decorated very modern the rooms themselves were a bit on the smaller side as was the bathroom but overall loved it great location right near central park several restaurant choices across the street and next door the place next door pj clarkâs unfortunately was a big disappointment though conveniently located the food was honestly mediocre at best the burger that was roughly 20 was not only small but flavorless go elsewhere hotel a;5

we have stayed at a lot of nice hotels around the world but riad kheirredine is our new favorite it is an absolute oasis in the middle of busy but wonderful marrakech we could go on and on about the great rooms food rooftop terrace but it is the staff that truly make it so special everyone is great but we would like to especially thank sara ilyas sihan elena and abrahim you made our stay fantastic;5

we spent two separate nights at the hyatt regency in september and could not fault either of them the rooms were spacious stylish and surprisingly quiet hardly ever did we hear planes taking off and then only barely all staff were extremely friendly and helpful free shuttle to and from the airport was a great bonus bathroom was compact but totally functional bed comfy great tv refrigerator room to spread out your bags we had the bonus of use of the regency club on our second stay which was wonderful for a generous breakfast or afternoon snack or somewhere quiet to sit and watch the world literally fly by the big surprise was the spectacular views of all the runways from the gym talk about incentive to exercise highly recommend staying here the night;5
nice location for business or tourist travel parking is 17;5

we stayed at this hostel over the new year and can have no real complaintswe were 3 lads just after a place to sleep that was clean and tidy which it wasit was 3 blocks from the subway station and was in a decent area with diners and a bar nearbyjust to get us started i agree that its hard to get the hot water flowing right in the shower but once you get the hang of it its ok also towels changed dailybins emptied and sheets changed dont come here expecting the hiltonfor 100 a night for 3 we thought it was great value and it left us more money to spend on the important things you dont go away to spend time in your room do you if you do stay here get the 7 day subway pass its only 24 and well worth it;5
it is very difficult to say anything better that has not already been said make no mistake the personal service which this fabulous team delivers is second to none marrakech old town is by the far the most fascinating city we have ever visited and must be on everyones bucket list crazy is an understatement to describe marrakech and while it feels you are stepping back in time riad kheirredine allows you the oasis you definalty need to relax and unwind there is no doubt that any seasoned traveller will still need the support of this fantastic team to help you navigate this chaotic and labyrinthine discombobulation elena and her team were always fast and considerate when answering our emails prior to travel and helped us find and book various restaurants which all turned;5
this is the first time im writing a tripadvisor in my professional capacity you experience a hotel in a different way when you work with them on hosting large groups of people in and out of town for meetings events and whatnot ive been working with the empire in this capacity for the last four years they really strive to accommodate the smallest of our myriad group requests from a guest arriving early in the morning without informing us theyll need an early checkin to last minute add ons and changes not that the hotel is empty it is usually booked to the rafters but still they find a way to accommodate im not normally the type to shout out individuals but we usually work with michelle liu inhouse to accommodate our guests once the booking has been;5

ive been to the empire hotel on a few different occasions with my boyfriend and we have always enjoyed our stay anniversary birthday etc mr ze at reception was approachable knowledgable and dedicated to ensuring we had a aboveandbeyond experience for new years eve our room was upgraded as a courtesy and we enjoyed having adjoining rooms almost like having our own living room that were clean gorgeous and spacious stunning view of the city really quite perfect for a romantic getaway beds are comfy and the amenities are plentiful my one disappointing element was that the sleep quality could have been better during this most recent visit we found that one of our rooms connected with a couple next door so we heard them quite loudlyclearly at night;5
i have been staying at the empire the last times i have been in nyc and it is always the same feeling â a nice combination of style and atmosphere together with great and very friendly staff moreover the location near central park is totally perfect i do highly recommend the empire hotel for anyone visiting nyc the rooftop bar is very nice too serving all kind of drinks you can think of again i highly recommend the empire hotel and i stay there next time thank you for last time and look forward seeing you again best pc;5

i have stayed at a number of hotels in manhattan and the empire will be my hotel of choice i am always prepared when staying in manhattan to compromise with some feature or another at a hotel it there is no such compromise here the facilities are great and the hotel staff professional friendly and helpful and pleasant the room was spacious enough and nicely decorated the rooftop bar was a lovely place to take in some mild february weather the only thing i would like to see is free wifi access in the room but the complimentary wifi in the beautiful lobby made up for it;5
we stayed here for one night on our way home from a longhaul trip i had originally booked at an expensive santa monica hotel but decided it was too much to haul the luggage get a cab etc so happy we changed our booking to the hyatt their shuttle runs every 15 minutes from the airport so it was a very quick pickup the checkin staff was extremely friendly and speedy and our room was great very clean bathroom and bedroom lots of space for our luggage and family of 4 we had very minimal needs while we were there but the bell hop offered lots of suggestions when he helped us to the room i was pleased they had a 24 hr fresh market with sandwiches drinks etc we did not purchase anything from there but it seemed reasonably priced it was less than 5 minutes;5

courteous front desk greetings extra washclothssoap quickly received and very willing to store luggagerequest cars jeff tiffany and several others were beyond helpful during our september girls trip the weekend after labor day we arrived before check in and were able to store our bags with no stress the room was spacious enough for 4 travelers and we slept great each night the shower with two nozzles took some getting used to but we really enjoyed our stay the only slight issue was that it wasnt quite as close to our broadway theaters as we had hoped but that was on us for not researching still walkable just not right with the theaters we would definitely stay again;5

wow what a place truly one of the most amazing places i have ever stayed i cant recommend riad kheirredine more highly as i am sure many people do we spent hours searching through trip advisor trying to find the best riad we could in marrakech based on the fantastic reviews we booked riad kheirredine and i am so thankful we did there is nowhere that could match it from the moment we arrived we were made to feel special ive never felt so looked after even in comparison to other 5 hotels stayed in around the world every single employee was beyond amazing and special thank you to elena who went above and beyond every day we felt like family and quickly grew used to nothing to lift a finger the riad itself is beyond stunning and the terrace is somewhere to find;5

stayed here for a week in september the hotel is very central close to the empire state building and a short walk from time square the room was small however its what you would expect in a city and we spent most of our time out sightseeing so it was perfectly adequate for our stay overall i couldnt fault anything about this hotel the service or location would recommend and would stay here again;5
riad kheirredine is a hidden gem that provides spectacular views a great location beautiful rooms and the best service i have encountered at a hotel anywhere locationwise it is perfect being inside the walls of the medina only a 10 minute walk to the infamous souks and a further 10 minutes to the palaces and the main square although the riad is situated close to the busy souks you must walk through some winding passages which provided a great back drop to photographs and means that when you are inside the riad it is very peaceful and quiet the riad arranged for us to be picked up from the airport and driven to the nearest taxi point to the riad where we were met by someone who walked us to the riad and a boy who took care of our luggage the other couple that were;5
we were greeted so warmly by text due to the late hour of our arrival at the airport and again when we arrived by the bell and front desk staff check in was quick and efficient and we arrived to a comforting and wellappointed room if i had to find something to comment upon it would be the tissues in the bathroom one ply a lovely corner room which was very comfortable was our âhomeâ for the 4 nights location is great to see universal and warner brothers studio free shuttle to universal and a 1520 cab ride to warner brothers excellent breakfast is amazing and i know why they are famous for their steakseafood buffet make a reservation would highly recommend this property and the team of folks there who will support your visit great brand ambassadors;5
nice location and close to shops 5th ave and subway also time square in walking distance hotel is also on the hop on hop of route if you want to explore new york staff was friendly and helped with airport transfer after the company that i booked with dropped us;5
yes the rooms are unique beautiful and quaint the food was fantastic but its the service that sets riad kheirredine apart from the rest the staff goes out of their way to make your entire visit to morocco memorable not just your stay at their hotel its also set in a great location still within the walls of the old city but far enough away to escape the madness of the main square as it was our favorite souks shops were the ones closest to the hotel its still a very easy and fun walk to and from the square and the riad kheirredine staff provides cell phones and even personal escorts stop searching this is the place you want to stay in marrakech;5
after reading mixed reviews of the hotel my expectations were low just in case it was as bad as some reviews make it seem the staff was extremely friendly and helpful the rooms were very clean and comfy great location to get out of new yorks fast pace the subway and bus stop was a pleasant and safe 3 block walk the only complaint i would have is the cable issue if you are looking to watch a lot of tv on your vacation i wouldnt recommend this hotel but if you are looking for a great deal on a great room in a great location this place should serve you as good as it did us;5
went for a long weekend shout out to mohammad for the free upgrade to a suite and complementary bottle of wine for my birthday staff was awesome room was very clean great location will def be returning;5
we have stayed at varied hotels whilst holidaying new york this was the first stay the new yorker the hotel dates back to 1919 and has enjoyed a lively and popular history we found the hotel clean and comfortable the staff were friendly and helpful especially krystle who helped us with our boarding passes for our return journey as the printer in the business centre was out of ink she was so happy to help our room was quite small but what do need if you are only sleeping in it the bed and pillows were so comfortable so we slept well we used the hotel bar on our first night but it was a little pricey which is to be expected in a hotel the hotel is so close to penn station which made ideal when arrived and departed the hotel is a little tired but clean but;5
as many previous reviews the location of the hotel is great i stayed 3 nights here the room i had stayed was very clean modern with comfortable bed the bathroom was large the staff was very helpful and friendly everything was good overall and met my exprectation;5
stayed at this location for a january event and was pleasantly surprised when we received an upgrade through wyndham rewards in addition the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful the room we were put in had the extra room which made the stay even better as rooms in nyc typically arent the most spacious we go to the same event in january every year and you can be sure that when we go again next year well be staying at the new yorker again;5

this is really a great hotel for what u paying everything is really clean and the cleaning service is really really great friendly stuff full of hospitality when im coming back id do definitely this hotel again;5
walking distance from the theme park but they also offered a courtesy shuttle had excellent customer service loved that we could refill our reusable water bottles with cold filtered water i appreciate a company that puts the environment and their customers before turning a profit selling overpriced bottled water;5

my husband and i went to new york for a podcast we stayed at the new yorker because of its rich history nikola tesla stayed here in room 3327 and you can still book his room the hotel positively gleams the fixtures are all polished to a high degree and the marble floors glow all of the staff were wonderful from the woman who checked us in to the bell hop who stored our luggage so we could explore the city for a few hours after we officially checked out the elevators were roped off and you needed to show your key to access them so you could get to your rooms the rooms were compact and immaculately clean with art deco trim on the light fixtures and the dresser i was tempted to try to bounce a quarter off the bed when we arrived because the sheet were so taunt;5
i stayed for a week in september with friends the hotel is located at vermont and santa monica blvd near to the metro which was really convenient for us cause with no car metro was our transportation to places like universal studios and hollywood walk of fame area location is very safe next to the hollywood blvd and close to the amazing griffith park and you can find supermarkets and restaurants around the hotel offers laundry service and for us that was very very helpful i think this hotel is the best choice if you want to save money with a very good rate you get a nice standard and clean room they have a nice duvet and comfortable bed every morning housekeeper comes and clean the room staff was very friendly and helpful the breakfast was very good eggs made;5
we stayed at the hotel for my husbandâs conference i like running the hotel is only a couple of blocks away from central park i had an excellent run there columbia university is short subway ride away and the station is 2 minutes walk from the hotel tons of great restaurants within walking distance the front desk staff and the lobby bartenders are really friendly a special shoutout to pasquace at the front deck;5
from arriving staff on reception and around the hotel were so friendly and helpful asked at check in if we could have a room with a view and receptionist checked and up graded had an amazing view used tic tok diner attached to hotel and food was brilliant just what we needed after walking all day also friendly staff would definitely recommend this hotel even after reading mixed reviews;5
this hotel was so cute and chic i absolutely loved the complimentary breakfast in the morning not to mention ali at the front desk was phenomenal he gave great recommendations and he was really kind thanks for a great stay;5
we were quite pleased with our stay at the hollywood parking is gated and for customers only i will say that i wish i knew ahead of time i would have to pay 26 a night for parking but i later realized this is much cheaper than most of la our room was cozy and spacious and very clean the free breakfast was impressive with made to order omelets and waffles super friendly staff location was great near metro and other tourist attractions;5
loved this hotel right next door to universal studios you could walk or take the free shuttle bus provided room was clean and tidy good size for our family of four for just a 3 night visit restaurant food was lovely and reasonably priced small coffee shop which had small food items for on the go small gift shop as well staff very friendly and the pool and spa area was fantastic very large and had bar and food available poolside if you are heading to the theme park then this would be a great choice to stay;5
amazing hotel and service upon the morning of arrival we were offered breakfast which was very welcome breakfast was great moroccan pancakes juice sweets jam honey fruits ham sausages and they can make you eggs and omelets â wonderful we were always given free water bottles when leaving the hotel for sightseeing or lemonade when staying in the room nice touch the hotel is located inside the medina which means you can only access it by foot â it takes 5 minutes fast paced through the narrow streets from the nearest taxi stop this however gives you the authentic and true natureadventure of marrakech which you will probably not find by staying in one of the larger hotel chains outside the city walls if you want the real deal riad kheirredine is the place;5
had a full week at the wyndham ny big opulent hotel with a room with a view got very helpful assistance from anthony and john at the concierge desk giving me the encouragement i needed to use the subway i was scared but i did it and feel like i can tackle anything after that asking people along the way i went from 911 memorial downtown to tomâs restaurant uptown for the seinfeld restaurant all by myself you havenât had the full ny experience til you rubbed shoulders with real newyorkers on the subway and enjoyed a full band with double bass player right in the subway thanks anthony for believing in me âyou can do thisâ in full ny accent i will always remember this;5

i booked this hotel last minute with plans of proposing to my then girlfriend across the street at the beautiful lincoln center upon hearing of this plan we were upgraded to a room with a view of lincoln center the staff was obviously extremely accomidating and friendly the room had a lovely view of lincoln center with a little to be expected street noise come on youre in nyc its unavoidable i found the room to be well appointed and comfortable i will say that the half shower glass wall was a little odd and did get the bathroom floor a little wet but other than that a great room in a great hotel in a fabulous location thank you very much for providing a comfortable end to a great and memorable day we will be back;5
iâve stayed at dozens of hotels in the city i come up for work once a month there is not a hotel with a better location with better amenities for the value anywhere when i look for a hotel i always check the empire hotel first;5
only complaint was that we stood in the checkin line for a long time before discovering wyndham rewards expedited checkin line the latter shouldve been more prominent;5
great service great location comfortable rooms the restaurant is intimate and private and the food is all great ive tasted everything on the menu i love it all the pool is usually empty but its big and heated with lots of place to get some la sun;5
i stay at the new yorker hotel several times a year every january i live there for close to ten days the hotel has been renovated over the past few years and the rooms are large and spacious several of the suites have balconies that overlook the city the staff is incredibly helpful and the rooms are always spotless one of the selling points is the location you are across the street from penn station and steps from several subway stations the public transit line bus runs right down eighth avenue if you are traveling to the city for business or pleasure this location is perfect;5
we have similar view of a courtyard to the one at the marriott county hall where we stayed for one night earlier in the year so let me list the differences here the staff are friendly here the door to the bathroom and carpets fit unlike the marriott which was very run down here we can stay for 3 nights for the same price as one at the marriott no contest this is a better hotel for a third the price;5
riad kheirredine is really something special different and unique an experience worth having it is a place with character a beautiful oasis in the middle of the magic medina a shelter for peace and relax after a busy day in this amazing city breakfast on the terrace was absolutely fantastic but the real added value is the staff those people are amazing they will treat and pamper you like you were their best friend coming to marrakech visiting them valentina yajaira daniele helena and everybody else went the extra mile to make us feel better than home always with a smile and i tell you sometimes it was not so easy as we were a family group of 15 of which 8 children and teenagers we will definitely come back grazie infinite;5
great service awesome room and really convenient location cant get better we went for a couples weekend with a group of friends and had a blast from the rooms the local nearby restaurants for brunch and the whole experience;5
we stayed at the ameritania over the 2019 labor day weekend the location is fantastic just around the corner from the stephen colbert ed sullivan theater five short blocks to central park and seven blocks to times square there is so much to see and do right in this area my wife and i like to walk so we walked from the hotel west to get on the high line walked down to chelsea market and then back itâs not a bad walk but if you have children they will get worn out the hotel is also close to public transit about five blocks away is the 4750 streets rockefeller station we got on there and took the subway to york st in brooklyn spent time in the dumbo area lots of places to eatsnack and then walked back over the brooklyn bridge the amertaniaâs location makes;5
this is not just a hilton high rise it was a beautiful hotel including the lobby atrium koi pond and rooms we were very fortunate to get upgraded to a suite that was the most amazing suite we have ever stayed in if you are going to universal which was so much fun donât waste your time on the shuttle unless you canât manage the walk we walked there in less than 10 minutes with 2 kids and itâs a beautiful walk the breakfast was so international and if you just want the continental they had plenty of choices we upgraded every morning kids free 12 and under and we had custom made omelets and pancakes the service was excellent we enjoyed gamil in the breakfast area and the front desk were super helpful and genuinely nice and patient with us donât consider anywhere;5
this hotel was in the perfect location for us we were able to get to times square central park and pier 83 easily and cheaply when traveling with two kids this is a must as soon as we pulled up there was a bellman ready to get our bags from the car and give us directions to the closest parking garage this hotel is traditional and full service you dont have to lift a finger there is a very small pool on the roof which came in handy because we were in new york during a heat wave the roof top bar was nice with good views just wish we could have sat outside but there was a storm the day we had time to go so it was off limits for safety we would stay here again anytime we liked this hotel for its character and staff the traditional feel was great which can be lost when;5
came for a wedding nicely updated hotel with clean comfortable rooms and a very convenient location incredibly quiet great shower i do wish the room was a little larger but itseems nyc so you expect small;5
our first visit to new york and we were delighted with the location of this hotel 10 min walk to times square 3 min to madison square gardens and 5 min penn station this is a huge hotel we stayed on 36th floor lots of lifts no delays and check in was efficient with friendly staff room was clean functional and had everything we required views were a bonus we didnt include breakfast which seemed very expensive instead preferred to try a few city locations for this each day this worked out great for us with a number of great diners and cafes within 10 min walk have stayed in wyndham berlin previously and again we were not disappointed its not necessarily cheap but we felt the price was worth it and we will definitely go back again next time;5
my girlfriend and i booked in feb we stayed in the imperial suite to pamper our selves for a week and oh my did the kherirredine pamper this is the first time that both me and my girlfriend have splashed out on a holiday as it is not usually affordable for us however the staff made it so worth it at the kheirredine each persons will obviously have a different experience in morocco but let me say a few points about the riad itself stunning decor large comfy rooms great food they give you a mobile with credit nice hammam and not too pricey fruit everywhere tea coffee with cookies whenever wherever the owners attention to detail makes the place impeccable service 247 i mentioned before we arrived in an email that it was my girlfriends birthday so upon arrival;5
the best and most convenient hotel if youâre going to the theme park top notch service and awesome amenities really felt safe during the pandemic not bad for the price either make sure you mention that youâre a hilton honors club member so you can unlock special privileges as well;5
spent 4 nights with my wife at this hotel on a typical touristy break the first room we were given after a 45 minute wait for it to be ready at 330pm was on the 1st floor faced on to the central aircon units and was very noise when we asked to be moved there was no issue and we were given a quieter room on the 3rd floor the room was very clean practical and was great value for the we paid would recommend and definitely revisit ð;5

we travelled to new york as a family of five kids aged 13 11 10 and spent two weeks at the new yorker i was worried as i had read some bad review but right for the beginning our stay was fantastic we arrived late in the afternoon and krystal on check in was so helpful even organising champagne for us as the trip was a 40th birthday celebration since we were staying an extended period of time they reduced the daly fee which was really nice the location was great and so close to lots of restaurants and the subway we ate in both restaurants and the service was great even on christmas morning when they were exceptionally busy the room was big enough for the five of us and even had a second bathroom so there was plenty of room for us we would definitely stay here again;5

spent 6 nights in this hotel and recommend it very highly for its convenience to the attractions new york has to offer central park is in easy walking distance the subway is closeby and on a straight line that takes you downtown and thus most of the main must dos such as statue of liberty world trade centreobservatoryobservatory a bit further away but an easy walk is down to the high line and hudson river park intrepid museum and a lovely walk along the river for its own sake get a 7 day metro card great value at 33 dollars each and saved us a lot of money avoid cabs expensive although addressed as times square thankfully the hotel wasnt right in amongst the times square bright lights and mayhem having been there i would not recommend a hotel;5

everyone at this hotel were very nice and helpful the rooms were a good size and had lovely outlooks we didnt get time to use the pool area close to train and buses to get everywhere and offered a lovely free breakfast which was a bonus south beach was at least 1 hour 15 min bus trip away which was very long but we were only 15 min away from universal and the strip which was great if you are going to universal leave at least an hour just for extra time to find your way and get the shuttle up to universal but it was not crowded so we had a great time even though arriving just after opening time we stayed in 3 rooms some had baths and some had showers but all were quite spacious and the beds were lovely;5

we came to nyc during one of the worst heatwaves on the east coast we had planned to stay 2 nights at the empire but had to extend our stay due to our difficulty in finding housing for our son who will be attending the very nearby fordham univ the front desk staff including jerry and lorena were incredibly understanding and very very helpful even though the hotel was nearly sold out they were able to accomodate our last minute extension and even allowed us to stay for a late check out when our flight was delayed the concierge yuri also helped us choose the fastest and least expensive way to get to the airport the only issue we had that was a bit unusual and a bit of an inconvience is that there was normally a fairly long line to use the elevator and the elevators;5
nice place and great service we choose this place as the price was decent the reviews seemed good and it is was near the theater district the decor is a bit modern in the lobby and rooms but still felt cozy and not industrial at first we were placed in an inside room where the ac was stuck on and the floor underneath it was wet this was in 10 degree weather brrr the service man came right away and we were moved to much nicer and warmer roomthe corner room on the second floor i slept great on the comfy king bed but my daughter had a harder time falling asleep because of outside noise the shower was great and the curtains were nice and thick to keep out the cold drafts the doormen were very helpful in pointing out places to eat how to navigate the subway;5
dena gisel and ivan were so so helpful from the moment we were frantically trying to find an alternative hotel from the one we booked all the way through checkout every time we passed the front desk they asked how our stay was going and if we needed anything the room had a cute view of the courtyard the beds were comfortable everything was in working order and very clean we will be coming to la every few months for my sonâs medical appointments and will continue to stay at the hollywood hotel;5

we arrived in marrakech with barely any plans or reservations other than the one for the riad kheirredine turns out that was all we needed from the time we arrived we were awed by the beauty of the riad and the hospitality of the staff everyone there managers hostesses waiters and maids always had a smile and friendly greeting regardless of how busy they may have been they made excellent suggestions and helped with reservations including a tour to the atlas mountains at reasonable rates and to outstanding restaurants with a good mix of moroccan and european dishes the facilities are absolutely top notch we stayed in a junior suite and were flabbergasted by the outstandingly wellappointed room it was really a storybook kind of surrounding tastefully luxurious;5

the last 2 reviews ranked it the best and i have to agree after 2 weeks in morocco changing riad every 2 or 3 days this is indeed the best the lady owner is italian and it shows in an almost obsessive attention to details which are overlooked elsewhere few examples the rooms have shutters i didnt find them anyplace else and was forced to wake up at 5 the minibar is free non alcoholics and so is any soft drink you may want to consume at the riad who ever heard of such a thing riads to stay fresh usually have small windows and little light not easy to perform a makeup but here a magnifying mirror will help you out the obsession to please you will go as far as giving you a cell phone to carry around to call if lost or in need of anything ismail will walk to to the;5
we had a one nighttwo part days stay prior to joining a cruise ship after an eleven hour flight we were relieved to arrive at the hotel and the reception staff were excellent very efficient and we quickly settle into our room which was spacious and had every facility we needed there was a very arty feel to the hotel with contemporary art work all around the hotel a very pleasant surprise as the swimming pool isnt very well signposted was the outdoor swimming pool which in 35c heat was a very welcomed relaxing area it is also a good size pool 25 metres and hardly used probably because there are virtually no signs or promotion of the swimming pool an excellent bar and restaurant cater for all your needs if somewhat expensive;5
5 stars for riad kheirredine during our trip to marrakech this riad is beautiful and so are the hearts of the people that work there we felt welcome like family from the moment we checked in until we checked out the staff went above and beyond to make our stay as special as possible accommodating food for late check in offering tea in the evenings organizing tours cabs and even a lovely birthday surprise with balloons and a cake the staff at kheirredine will definitely look after you and youll be left feeling like this is your little oasis in marrakech the breakfast hammam cleanliness and overall hospitality was exceptional and luxurious i would love to stay here again;5

we had a wonderful 5 night stay at the riad kheirredine weâve stayed at various hotels across the world including well known luxury brands but this was by far our favourite hotel to date the experience was perfect from the start we received an email from the hotel as soon as we made our booking and were offered the chance to book an airport transfer and a meal on arrival we booked the airport transfer and arrived in marrakech to find someone waiting for us at the airport with the hotel sign we were transferred to a meeting point near the hotel in a spacious airconditioned car the hotel is down a narrow street so the car could travel no further a hotel representative arrived at the meeting point took our bags and guided us through the labyrinth of streets to the;5

this was a really nice hotel to stay in as it is next to universal studios and the rooms are nice we had a double deluxe room with a view of universal on the 20th floor so we got to see the waterworld show with flames and flares the breakfast that is included or optional extra is a continental only and for 10 more you get hot breakfast as well the only thing that is sad is that all the breads croissants and bagels are stale and the bread for toasting smells sour from being stale my 5 star rating is for the quality of rooms and proximity to universal;5

it is said that true character is shown when times are challenging and the riad kheirredine certainly lived up to and beyond the expectations we had when reading the various reviews we arrived as a family of seven for the year end holiday season when a curfew was announced across marrakech effectively closing all restaurants and confining people to their hotels riads after 8pm despite these very real constraints the riad kheirredine provided exceptional service the staff went above and beyond to make our stay a truly exceptional one they found solutions to make our stay magical to the point where we did not even notice that a curfew had been decreed a beautiful place to stay is only part of a holiday experience indeed it is the people who work hard to satisfy their;5

we were a family of 4 travelling in morocco and riad kheirredine was our first stop it is a beautifully designed serene riad a 10 minute walk from the souks while you give up that central proximity the value is that you get to experience the quieter nontouristy parts of the old medina and the riad makes it very easy for you to navigate they give you a local cell phone preprogrammed with their number to use during your stay and walk you tofrom your destinations if needed though we were excited to learn to navigate on our own and felt really accomplished when we did valentina yajaira youssef brahim and all the staff took such good care of us it was hard to say goodbye to them when the airline lost one of our bags they took the time to help us call;5
we were in new york last week and stayed at the empire hotel which was recommended by our family members in addition to an unbeatable location this hotel has such an amazing staff everyone from the front desk to housekeeping were attentive and super nice especially we would like to thank a front desk manager daria who was overall very sweet and made a few great suggestions for places to go to in the city special thank you for making a reservation in tao where we were treated as vip on our last night in new york the only little disappointment was a charge for wifi in the room but it was a minor flaw in comparison with all good stuff they have to offer we cant wait to come back to this beautiful city next year and stay at the empire hotel again;5

awesome place clean centered to everything pil was super helpful and nice he answered all my questions and even suggested me places to visit here in hollywood would definitely stay here again in my next vacation secure parking on site was a plus;5
the hotel is unexpectedly comfortable the area is questionable but the staff helps you feel welcome pil is above the rest through my stay he was the only one that never asked for a review when i approached him he was genuine and helpful even when worked back to back days the hotel provides breakfast but as much as itâs hyped up the chef is kinda of rude if you ask him for any extra since the area is downstairs you do walk away with a heavy odor or musk but itâs worth it since you get home made breakfast the pool is spacious but you will get killed by the mosquitoes but pil did warn us and gave us some mosquito repellent wipes overall the hotel is comfortable the staff is pushy for reviews but regardless some staff do earn it like the maids the cooks and some;5
from the efficient airport transfer to the hotel entrance we were immediately impressed by the continual attention to our comfort our first journeys into were escorted until we could recognize landmarks within the riad we were separate from the bustle of the narrow streets and souks each day started with a generous breakfast at a time and location in the riad to suit us all staff were friendly and helpful providing tea or coffee on our returna relaxing break;5

im a solo traveller and stayed for a full 7 nights and my assessment is this the jane is a great hotel in a wonderful part of town at a very good price point shared bathrooms are a hoot plenty of hot water always clean rooms are small and cozy but youre out of the place most of the day anyway two caveats for any random noise and the fan and air conditioning do make some i went and bought a package of foam ear plugs at a local duane reade problem solved also the hotel provides you with a pair of slippers but i like wearing flipsflopsthongs in the shower so on my first day after checkin i wandered over to chinatown and bought a pair of rubber shower shoes for a few dollars;5
always stay at the jane but this weekend is booked so i cant stay there it is wonderful hotel and i love it it is almost a tradition for me hopefully next time i love the ambience the convenience and the history of this hotel;5
my family and i just stayed there this weekend its a beautiful hotel very clean the staff was very helpful and friendly check in is at 3pm we got there well before that they were very accommodating and were able to let us check in to our room early the room was very clean and spacious the beds were very comfortablethe bathroom was clean and beautiful we stayed on the 4th floor id read reviews that the lower floors were noisy but i didnt have any problems with noise not even coming from the freeway they have a huge buffet we didnt eat there because we spent most of our time out but it looked very nice parking is pretty expensive and wifi isnt free its just minutes away from hollywood blvd and a short walk from universal citywalkuniversal studios they do;5
nice clean hotel near central park and fairway market 33 cent water bottles fresh fruit muffins breads and spreads salads meat cheese etc kitchenette was very useful clean towels sheets extra pillows bathroom was a little tight but it was ok comfortable in a room with a double bed and pullout sofa for 3 people subway station close by very convenient good neighborhood very safe for 3 young girls hotel staff was friendly only bad thing is that they charge 5 for each piece of luggage you want to store past checkout this should be complimentary hotel lobby looked great newly renovated overall great experience;5
i stayed with my adult daughter for 9 nights and it was a very safe choice it was a great location and easy walk everywhere a lovely diner and restaurant attached well run hotel adequate room size dated bathroom that worked really well is all part of the history and privilege of staying there loved the big revolving door close to madison macys intrepid times square and many other places you need to show your lift card to enter that area very helpful staff clean with all toiletries quick taxi base laundry mat close;5

the rooms in the hotel are quite small but very clean and comfortable the staff were excellent both on reception the concierge services and the maids said particularly went over and above what was required when my friend lost her phone she did get it back the hotel is convenience for the shows and near to several subway stations its also in what appears to be a nice safe area we didnt have any problems walking anywhere i would definitely stay there again if i visit new york again;5

i had a 24 hour layover between flights and chose the hyattone of several hotels on century boulevard leading into lax highly recommended clean bright modern dã©cor with outstanding customer service some noise from departing aircraft but convenience to the airport outweighs this minor issue free shuttle a restful place to layover in los angeles;5
we always stay here due to its proximity to the amtrak station which is a very short walk for our purposes it is also very close to anything you might want to see in midtown manhattan this hotel is always clean with courteous helpful staff a beautiful restaurant open 24hrs is in one corner with lots of windows to see the city activity if you watch the room sale offers you can visit for a reasonable price in a very pricey city;5

the jane is an excellent place to stay affordable chic and very friendly the cafe downstairs is a must excellent touches great cuisine and fantastic cup of coffee the single rooms are small but very clean compact and efficient in design the staff is so friendly i was so pleased with the whole experience it is in walking distance to everything in the village a nice walk and subway ride to anything else plenty of cabs right in front of the jane if walking and subway are not your thing park also close for a beautiful walk with a river view no business center but free wifi in your room which was a big plus and one reason among others why i will always choose the jane while traveling to the big apple;5
this wonderful riad is an oasis of calm serenity in the endearing chaos of marrakech we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary here and can honestly say that the level of service and attention to detail were on a higher level than anything we have experienced before they arranged airport transfers and the car took us to a small square where we were warmly welcomed by staff from the riad who put our luggage on a small cart and led us through a labyrinth of tiny passages to reach our destination there behind a plain wooden door lay a wonderland the riad kheirredine is a beautiful conversion of two large moroccan houses with internal courtyards a pool and waterfall and stunning traditional features the contrast with the world outside is breathtaking the greeting;5
just across the street from penn station and madison sauare garden great staff and clean rooms we were lucky to have a newly renovated room on the 30th floor 1015 min walk to times square too great to have a 24 hour diner at the bottom of the hotel serving traditional american food retro hotel with interesting history would definitely stay her again thank you the new yorker we canât wait to come back;5

the lobby was bright and inviting great for tired tourists returning from an exciting day touring the big apple this hotel gives guests a handson experience of its historic location in a small museum below the building accessible through the lobby which is a convenient way to pass the time waiting for a cab or tourbus though the room i requested was not as roomy as expected my stay was delightful with two comfy beds to fit anyones comforting needs the room also came with a spacious closet large enough to fit a small floormattress in which can easily be provided by room service ondial the hotel is set in a fascinating location in the heart of manhattan which can be seen from the windows in the apartment when hungry for a sweet bite the hotel offers;5
we spent 3 nights at the hilton and though it was on the expensive side you really canât beat the location and proximity to universal studios and city walk we chose to walk rather than take the free shuttle because it was a nice and easy walk weâve previously visited universal from anaheim either by shuttle or self drive and so it was nice not to have to worry about what time we had to leave where we parked the car traffic etc the hotel itself was nice with great amenities our room was big with a big bathroom and great water pressure in the shower which is always a bonus we had a little hiccup with a squealing noise coming from the ac but i went down to the concierge desk and jesse made sure it was immediately attended to we were given complimentary breakfast;5

after arriving late at night i was glad that the airport was so close to the terminal the shuttle picked us up within minutes of stepping outside of baggage claim this was one of my biggest concerns as i had heard that the wait for a shuttle could be lengthy ours was not at all but i will say that as we stopped at the other terminals our shuttle filled up quickly and they had to call for another shuttle checkin was quick and easy our room was clean and very quiet perfect the breakfast buffet was excellent with the service being very friendly and attentive late checkout was an added bonus while there is nothing boutiquey about this hotel they product is very good and meets or exceeds expectations it is a great option for nearairport stay i would;5

we took amtrak to nyc and when we exited penn station we could see the new yorker hotel the hotel was conveniently located for a fabric buying expedition since it was near the garment district macys is near by as well the rooms were fine view of the empire state building good mattresses tv desk and 2 chairs the bathroom was updated but the pedestal sink provides little storage all aspects of service were good the tic tock diner was located within the hotel building accessible through the lobby the rooms accommodated 4 women willing to share and cooperate we chose this hotel primarily for its location and were very satisfied;5

my wife and i have been traveling for 40 years we have never stayed at a better place it obviously does not need another review as they all seem to be 5 stars but i must write this from the moment we arrived everything was near perfect they sent someone pick us up at the airport a person met the car at the edge of the medina and helped with our bags we arrived and elena the receptionist said you have been traveling this morning it was about 11 and you probably missed breakfast so we have laid it out for youeat first and then you can see the roomfruit meat cheese etc we were taken to our beautiful room complete with fresh flowers and fruit and she said you have been traveling for a couple weeks so you must have dirty laundry give it to us laundry is;5
it was a very nice hotel the staff were wonderful and assisted us whenever we needed something the hotel is in walking distance to unoiversal studios and just a short cabride to other areas of interest the room was very clean and sanitary our request for extra linen was placed in our roomprior to our arrival the food was delicious i would definitely recommend this hotel;5

hotel was quick to get to from newark airport we upgraded to a suite which was no trouble for the staff all staff were friendly and went out their way to help great location opposite madison square garden and close to penn station our suite was on level 30 and from the lounge we could see the empire state building room was clean and lounge and bedroom had individual temperature controls only gripe was that we booked bed and breakfast and breakfast was only a juice coffee and a croissant or similar pastry if weâd been told this by our travel agent weâd have gone room only however the tick tick diner did take a reduction for our more substantial breakfast using the breakfast coupons that was the only gripe about the hotel very busy city and we fitted lots in next;5
been here twice now and both times i have enjoyed my stay the hotel is welcoming and classic in decor the staff are friendly and will help with anything you need the rooms are clean and tidy whilst being well equipped for a short or long stay the maids come in everyday and make the beds as well as replacing towels if needed location is ideal subway next door as well as times square and empire state building within 10min walk will certainly stay again should i visit nyc in the near future;5

i have stayed at this hotel several times and it has always been a pleasure the rooms have awesome views the beds are very comfy and the bathrooms are clean a nice touch this last time was crabtree evelynâs la source bath products in the bathroom very nice this hilton has also always had a nice fruit light snack platter waiting for us when we arrive that may be because i am in hilton hhonors program im not sure the hotel is located right next to universal studios and i have found great hotelthemepark packages on various websites in the past;5
we stayed at riad kheirredine for 4 nights recently and it was a highly pleasurable experience i cannot recommend this establishment highly enough for any traveller or holiday maker service we have never experienced such dedicated and attentive service the staff were incredibly helpful and did everything they could to make our stay in marrakech as pleasant as possible other travellers who were staying in large expensive hotels informed us that the staff were non personable and looking for tips riad kheirredine staff are not like this theyâre friendly noninvasive and polite cleanliness the standards of hygiene and cleanliness were excellent our rooms were cleaned at least once every day and the staff went to levels that in my experience are unprecedented;5
arrived for a 4 day break at the new yorker and immediately pleased with the location walking distance to many tourist landmarks maria on the front desk took some extra time to give us tips and local knowledge which was greatly appreciated plus some recommendations of where to go which really paid off all the staff were lovely but maria made an extra effort when we saw her a credit to the hotel would definitely stay again our room wasnt the biggest but clean quiet everything worked and the bed was really comfortable ideal for couples on their first visit to the big apple;5

the jane is an adorable hotel near the high line chelsea market the air conditioned rooms are very small 50 sq ft and the bathrooms are shared if you dont plan on hanging out in your hotel room this is a great choice the shared bathrooms enforce a greater sense of community it is hard to stay aloof when your fellow patrons are heading to the shower in a bathrobe the rooms all have flat panel tvs ac and a fan mine had a view of a brick wall i must stress that these rooms are very small one person fitsbarely two people will only fit if you get bunk beds and really really get along there isnt a closet but there are hooks for hanging clothing they have regular rooms with attached baths but those are more expensive there is a;5

i stayed here with a friend of mine in september 2014 and it is difficult to say precisely how excellent a place this was the rooms were clean and beautifully decorated our bed was turned down every night we had free refreshments pretty much on tap and free bottles of water were given to us when we visited the atlas mountains the food was very good though we only ate dinner a couple of times in the riad itself the breakfasts were extensive and tasty the staff were amazing we couldnt have asked for anything better valentina and yajaira gave us fantastic advice on where to go and what to do and they helped us to organise the trips we decided to take the girls also gave us advice on where to eat which was helpful and we had some really nice food we were given a mobile;5
well what can i say from the moment of arrival by taxi to leaving the riad for the airport we can truly say we were treated like royalty our taxi driver called the riad reception about 10 minutes away to let them know we were arriving on arrival we were met by a couple members of the hotel staff who greeted us well and made sure they carried our bags for us as they walked us to the riad the walk to the riad is about 5 minutes as it is through the narrow streets of marrakech which only mopeds can access when we got to the riad we had a wonderful smiley greeting from sara who instantly made us feel welcome with refreshments and made sure everything was ok we were then given a tour of the wonderful riad and shown to our room which our luggage was waiting for us the;5
we stayed 3 nights in march 2012 and had a great time the staff were all extremely helpful with whatever we needed dont think ive ever stayed somewhere where i got that much personal attention the breakfast every morning was delicious and the one time we had dinner at the riad it was very good as well more expensive than what you could find elsewhere but it was nice to stay in and eat at the riad after a long day of travel really loved the terrace up top where you could just relax and take in the views overall was a great experience would definitely stay here again;5

my wife and i visited morocco for the first time last week and we decided to stay at the riad kheirredine for our 3 nights in the medina we went into the trip with pretty high expectations of the riad based on all of the reviews we saw and all i can say is wow every one of these were absolutely blown away from the moment you enter the riad sara and her team do anything and everything to make sure your stay is not only comfortable but in a way that truly makes you feel like you are staying with friends or family the location can be difficult to find but with the help of the staff who is willing to take you tofrom the closest taxi stand this is no problem they provide an android smartphone with a local mapnavigation app as well as the staff numbers to call should;5

one of the best place iâve stayed at hands down from communication with bookings till check out they have a clear communication and instructions by the time you arrived at the airportparking lot upon check in they were warm and took time to explain and tour you around the riad gave recommendations and tips on what to do and not do in the area they also give you a mobile phone with data to use with maps and calling them in case you get into some problems or troubles glad i didnât have to use it thereâs also an option to have someone escort you out and back to the riad if you are not comfortable walking by yourself to the neighborhood the location of the riad is just outside the souks you have to maze around the area to get back to your place which can be intimidating;5

we arrived in marrakech to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and we had an amazing stay mostly because of riad k the service and the staff of the riad was first class and this was by far the best service i have ever received anywhere in the world the rooms were beautifcally decorated in true moroccan style with oil musk scents pleasantly burning in the room the riad gave us a mobile phone which allowed us to call them anytime 247 if we were lost staff were so friendly kind personable and helpful an they would guide to areas where as tourists we could go on from easily the highlight of our stay was the scrumptious almond butter served during breakfast of which they kind gave us a jar to take home free of charge there are too many value added services to list;5

we stayed at the riad kheirredine between 21st o 26th feb 2016 we organised a airport transport directly with the riad which was a great service from greeting us in the arrivals hall to a porter and riad employee helping with our luggage from the taxi drop off point to the riad front door about a 510min walk depending on how fast you walk we traveled with a baby under 2 years old and this really helped to take away some stress of arriving in an unknown area it takes getting used to walking through the interlinking passages and the local pace of life in the medina but we had no safety issues and were constantly reassured by riad staff tour guides other riad guests and local residence we actually started enjoying the challenge of navigating the medina which was;5
we left a part of our hearts in marrakech you are probably reading this review if you are scrolling through the hundreds of riads in marrakech and canât decide the perfect one let me stop your search this is the one we would rate it 6 if we could it is a true hidden gem deep within the walls of the medina the riad is honestly stunning itâs spacious clean and has a real sense of luxury while maintaining the cultural moroccon flair what really stands out here is the service it was the best service we have ever received the team go above and beyond and made us feel like royalty from the moment we landed sara elena siham were all so welcoming and tailored our holiday to our wishes including personally preparing our room with my requests to celebrate my partners;5

we drove all the way from nebraska and were exhausted by the time we arrived and frankly felt like fish out of water however the hotel staff were amazing and helped us to fit right it right from the start we got to nyc a day early and they were able to accommodate us this hotel has such a professional yet comfortable welcoming atmosphere the rooms are clean and housekeeping was super kind we never felt like we had to worry about any of our personal belongings when leaving for the day and after touring nyc everyday for 5 days it was so nice to know we had our clean hotel to go to that we felt completely safe and comfortable in security is awesome at this hotel as well great room great view and excellent location;5

this is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of marrakech it is a huge contrast in itself as you walk from the rather untidy streets which have their own identity into the peace and quiet of this excellent riad is is surpassed though by one thing only that is the staff that run it the service is the best i have experienced with incredible attention to detail the staff will walk you to restaurants to ensure you do not get lost and enjoy your time the cleaning team are amazing this place must be cleaned constantly to maintain the standards we experienced the reception team are attentive very efficient and friendly and seem to read your mind all in all a superb raid stylish relaxing better than the great photos on line and highly recommended you will love it;5

though we are not strangers to the city this was our first time in 30 years staying in this particular area and it was a pleasure our stay was only 1 night as we were attending a show at feinsteinâs 54 below which was literally maybe 50 yards away we arrived early and the friendly doorman hugo i think took our bags to hold until check in the front desk associate vlem so sorry if i messed up the name was friendly welcoming and very courteous check in was fast and we were upgraded to a very spacious mini suite it was sooo nice to have that extra space with all our coats and umbrellas we never waited more than a minute or two for an elevator and the lobby has a nice lounge area what i did notice as we waited for 300 check in was that several staff members came;5
we have just spent 5 nights in this amazing riad as there are no roads directly to the riad you are met at the nearest taxi stop and taken thru the narrow laneways with donkeys and motor scooters you then step into this beautiful oasis where you hear nothing of the outside chaos rooms are all different themes but beautifully furnished ours with a huge four poster bed there are two pools to relax in after a hard day in the mã©dina dinner and breakfast on the roof top terrace were always great the riad organised two day tours for us one to a trek in the atlas mountains and one to the seaside town of essaouira both great days the service in the riad was just superb with a special mention to brahim who was always there for us at breakfast and dinner with a big;5
my daughter and i stayed for 5 nights at the empire following her knee surgery we were in the room 247 except for me leaving to get get food and supplies i was concerned at first reading some of the other reviews but our stay could not have been better the staff was welcoming and accommodating i had to trade out ice packs frequently throughout the day and night with the staff at the desk all were gracious and helpful iâd like to give a special shout out to ami who called me twice to make sure everything was to my liking other notable staff who assisted during a difficult time were adamherman fatima and chortten the housekeeping staff was respectful of our privacy and cleared away trash and brought fresh towels and toiletries even though we couldnât have;5
the hotel was extremely quite the rooms were good clean and spacious the food at the restaurant was quite good and the fact that there is a market open 247 and that the shuttle runs to the airport every few minutes even at 4 am were a plus in addition the staff was very attentive polite and caring not your usual airport hotel;5
my boyfriend and i stayed here a couple of weeks ago and the staff was simply amazing emanuela and marko were extremely helpful in guiding us in the right direction the rooms were extremely well appointed with typical moroccan furnishings and impeccably clean the food was amazing for 25 euro each we had a 4 course meal and some wine we ate at cafe arabe where the food was half as good and half the quantity we enjoyed sitting on the terrace and watching the sunset as we sipped our wine they even upgraded us to the nicer rose room since it was available and only charged us for the rate of the cheaper room one caveat to staying here is that it is a little far from the plaza el fna and youll need to be very clear on how to return to the riad after a hectic day;5
i stayed here ages ago and just like then it was greatness usually a hotel drops in quality over that length of time but that was not the case in my opinion most rooms ive had in the area are small and over priced not sure if i lucked out but i got a large well appointed quiet room for a very solid price i did not use to main dining rooms not my thing so i used the coffee stand each morning it was great and exactly what i needed i would like to add how great the staff was the hotel was packed and i know there were complaints about the elevators from some well not from me there was always somebody by them to help every time i used them i made sure to thank them each time because i know how thank less the job can be sometimes lastly i liked to thank;5
location location location this was a great place to stay i was on the 18th floor it was nice modern quiet friendly staff helpful concierge with knowledge of many dining option parking is pricey i wish i would have stayed longer;5
i am so glad we chose this place to stay in new york our first time in new york and our visit here i believe it was enhanced by the excellent quality of service from the staff at the jane and its location the bellboys with their quirky old fashioned attire but impeccable service and professionalism really are great our room overlooked the hudson and the view every morning and every evening made our day something to look forward to we chose to have our own ensuite captains cabin im pleased we did spacious and clean we stayed five nights here and found the location just perfect for what we wanted to see and do daily right by the highline shops markets and close to the subway perfect we could escape to the garden bar for a drink or walk across the road to;5
just returned home from new york and had a brilliant time the hotel was in a great location making it easy to get to the main attractions our stay was made extra special by guest service agent mohammed who went above and beyond to make our stay here special the room was clean and and the beds were really comfy;5
great location slightly away from the noise of times square and just a few steps to several subway stops we had a deluxe room and it was very good plenty big enough and a nice bathroom with natural light and a window after quite a bit of confusion checking in rob helped me out and even upgraded our room free of charge so my friend and i had two beds instead of having to share thanks so much would definitely recommend if you can get a good deal expensive otherwise but you get what you pay for in nyc;5
near madison square calm nice view on the city kindness of the staff and very clean october was a good period quality price just consider you have to pay about 20 taxes a day and 24 a day wifi and fitness access;5
great location within walking distance of central park museums shopping and good restaurants spacious room with two beds and a small sitting area overlooking the lincoln center beds very comfortable with soft clean bedding the heating is a bit noisy at night we turned it off for the night and stayed cozy under the down covers staff were very attentive to our requests and room service was fast;5
this is a lovely hotel and we were treated so nice the buffet is really amazing huge with so many wonderful choices crab legs oysters on the half shell prime rib and lobster a taco bar chocolate fountain etc too many items to mention fresh and fabulous;5
all the reviews are true we have never been so well looked after the riad itself is elegant tucked away from the main square but an enjoyable walk to and from the action we walked everywhere and did not need one taxi there are lots of maze like narrow streets in the mã©dina and you can feel a little overwhelmed at first but we soon got to recognise the area and happily walked to and from the centre ourselves but the hotel will send someone out to walk you out and also to pick you up if you feel at all nervous some kids may try and tell you that the streets are closed so that you have to pay them to find an alternative route but they are harmless just ignore them and they will leave you alone i would say that the photos of the riad donât do it justice the interior has;5
we enjoyed last years stay so much that my teenage daughter and i returned again this week and we were so glad we did its still buzzing fun quirky from the moment you walk into the lobby the staff is wonderful friendly outgoing lila and her colleagues at the front desk chris and the other concierge staff michael and the other gents on the front door there was no problem too small restaurant reservations shuttle arrangements parking for my niece driving in from connecticut you name it they sorted it out rarely have i seen a hotel with so many cheerful efficient employees yes the rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny and yes the showers can be a pain but having said that everything does work properly and the beds are very comfy with;5

riad kheirredine is an oasis of peace comfort and beauty in the heart of the medina our most lovely days were entirely at the riad and involved sumptuous and elaborate breakfasts too many moroccan mint teas which are offered without extra charge cosy evening readings by the fireplace and tasty moroccan or italian dinners at the riads restaurant the service was personalized and very attentive ibrahim and jana made us feel very comfortable and well taken care of the attention to detail is amazing and everything is homemade from the jams to the apple sauce etc they also help organise excursions out of marrakech the medina tour was excellent we also tried out the spa and left feeling refreshed;5

the ameritania was a good place for us location wise close to times square theaters restaurants etc we had a room on the second floor facing broadway it was really noisy it was almost as if the windows were open they were not or that there were not any windows at all we heard everything but the room itself was good and the bathroom clean and functional it is the staff at the ameritania who make it special they are so nice said was especially helpful and informative he was great;5

booked this hotel based on location and wow has it got the location it is two blocks from empire state and seconds from madison sq garden its about 15minutes walk to top of the rock madam tassauds theatre district times square and many other great attractions in any directions and right opposite lirr line or subway station when we arrive mohammed on the front desk surprised us by giving a comp up grade to the 36th floor which had been refurbed and had a great view of empire state building room was average size but knew in advance that rooms not big in ny so this certainly was not a down side besides we were there to sightsee so couldnt have cared if we had been in a broom cupboard but room was really clean and bed was very good after hard day of walking the tick tick;5
this hotel is awesome the staff was always nice to us and greeted us each and every single time we walked in and out of the hotel the rooms were very nice and the location is perfect when you visit universal studios and if you dont want to walk the short distance to the park you can ride the bus that picks you up right in front of the hotel and when your day is finished they will take you back to the hotel we was so tired and thirsty from universal studios park it was nice to have ice cold water with bit of lemon and lime at the front when you walked in they also had fruit you could take to your room at the front desk and we had a beautiful view of hollywood hills from our room the only complaint that i have were the valet parking was a little pricey at the buffet at;5
i missed my flight to new york and wanted to spend the night at a hotel near la airport to take an early morning flight the next day hyatt regency is just 08 miles from the airport and is the perfect choice it provides shuttle service to and from the airport throughout the day 24 hours;5

my husband and i stayed in the new yorker for a four day stay with our two children 11 9 i was concerned the room would be too small but was pleasantly surprised there was plenty of room even with two queen sized beds in the room small bathroom but large bedroom area plenty of wardrobedraw space the lifts can get busy depending on what time you hit them tick tock diner within hotel was also very good ð if it had tea coffee facilities in the room would have been great but there is plenty of places to grab a coffee and take it back to your room nice to have a safety deposit box in room without extra charge also iron and full sized ironing board very useful;5
while the hollywood hotel is my la home away from the oc hugo offers the best custom egg dishes for breakfast even beating the fancy expensive eateries in hollywood and its included in your stay hugos breakfast is just one more reason to stay at the hollywood hotel we stayed there this weekend to go see kinky boots playing 10 minutes away at the pantages theatre read my review on the play also on trip advisor another reason to visit hollywood;5
we had an overnight stay at the new yorker it is a classic older hotel that has been wellmaintained and has a historic vibe to it it is located close to the amtrak station to which we were riding if in nyc again we will consider the new yorker hotel our stay was booked as part of a vacation package so we dont exactly know how much the room cost;5
jennifer at the desk was amazing i booked a suit for my daughters 23 birthday and she upgraded us to a corner suit with a great view of lincoln center she made a great start to a great stay thank you jennifer;5
highly recommended nice riad with plenty of space terraces and two plunge pools still rather cold end of april staff goes really out of their way to accommodate the guests and give tips of what to do and where to go great breakfast and we also enjoyed the dinner location is fine some 10 to 12 min walk to beginning of medina transfer to and from airport was included we struggled with the slow or nonexistent wifi connections the first two days but that got solved afterwards;5

perfect location for any of new york tourist attractions very quiet hotel comfortable beds pillows and towels safe included with room able to store luggage for a 5 fee if checkout is before your shuttle back across the street from penn station subway walking distance to many great eateries;5
we could see the new yorker when we came up on the street from the subway perfect location the lobby had all the flavor of nyc â buzz and excitement snacks drinks coffee full breakfast and dinner were readily available without leaving the hotel in case of inclement weather the 1930s bathtub and plentiful hot water afforded me delicious soaks after each arduous day love this hotel;5
itâs been a long time since iâve loved a hotel as much as the jane everything was wonderful super friendly and helpful staff comfy beds great ac a fantastic shower good restaurant downstairs and a fabulous location if i had to pick on it iâd only say i would like a kettle or coffee maker in the room since room service isnât available anymore i wonât ever stay anywhere else in nyc;5
clean modern and quiet rooms itâs close to the airport but also close to the city life they offer a free airport shuttle which runs every 10minutes or so the pool area is beautiful and very relaxing for members youâll get free access to regency club who offers breakfast midday snack drinks and a predinner snack you also get a late checkout if you want to i stayed until 2pm and that was great;5

best lax airport for a quick stopover due the quick park the hyatt has several shuttle buses this makes going from the gate to bed very fast if your departing from terminal 1 or 2 simply walk over etc great food and service;5
we loved our stay in hotel empire from the very first time we stepped into the hotel until our last day we stayed in a junior suite and was definitely beautiful with a view to central park amazing hotel facilities and the staff were wonderful helpful and so friendly guarantee we will be back;5
for our first real visit to nyc we opted to stay at the new yorker as wyndham points holders we were very impressed the executive double room was spacious comfortable with central air and had a lovely view of madison square garden the beds were comfortable the bathroom was especially small although there was plenty of room in the shower and the remodel of these rooms make everything very new and modern the wifi allows for plenty of connections and is super fast and easy to connect to there is a keurig coffee maker in these rooms and a cvs across the street so getting k cups and creamer was super easy there is also a nice cold minifridge and an excellent insulated ice bucket im not sure it can get much better for location penn station subway station is;5
the service accommodations and location were ideal we need some flexibility in scheduling and nancy rameriz was incredible great staff all were solution oriented and made our stay terrific we really liked the secure parking and security system in getting to our room also the coffee pot microwave and frig were such a nice touch the courtyard was wonderful and great pool too;5
stayed over spring break with my 16 year old son we were very new to los angeles and the hotel staff was so incredibly helpful the breakfasts included in your room charge every morning are fabulous and the staff are all so lovely in particular i would like to commend sonia elvira hugo jermaine and cecile for always being so incredibly helpful and pleasant they made me feel like royalty sonia if i could have taken you home with me i would have the hotel is close to public transit and uber makes getting around very affordable i definately stay at this hotel again the only thing i would add though no fault to the hotel the area around the hotel doesnt offer a lot nor is it the best for walking around at night however we used uber and affordably;5
the days inn is a very good hotel though the decor can be a bit oldfashioned that doesnt matter the rooms are clean safe the cleaning service is fantastic and the reception staff were very lovely the wifi is very poor though it is basically useless;5
i rate this hotel about 455 but i absolutely love it and still talk about i stayed with my boyfriend however my friend and sister were also staying there as well its great if your main concern is universal and hollywood its a about a block away from universal studios just have to cross the bridge and the street hollywood blvd with great clubs and tourist attractions are just a 10 min metro away no little gas stations or shops outside the hotel though as it is located right beside the park on the hill so gas stationspharmacies were a walk down and around a few blocks with nothing open 24 hours metro was just down the hill very easy to access a little tricky to navigate at first considering we didnt realize there was an underground train blonde moment wifi in;5
absolute perfect stay not a single thing i can fault great location hotel is very clean and stunning lobby can be a bit lively at night round the hotel but no noise when in the room a hotel full of charm and character just what you want as a tourist thank you to all the staff and we will see you again hopefully;5
i normally stay in hollywood when im in la but i had a late flight and thought id stay at the airport the hyatt was a great price and i thought it would be convenient i was pleasantly surprised when i got there as i was named the discoverist of the day the pantry is well stocked and enjoyed my 20 credit the room was clean and newly redecorated it was very quiet in spite of being so close to the airport and freeways i took a spin in the gym in the morning and the view of the airport and the city from the top floor was stunning my only sticking point was that the van ride to the hotel was a bit crazy the driver drove very fast and the luggage was all over the floor and not all in the racks;5
i like a comfortable bed and a clean quiet room my room was comfortable clean and quiet i liked the aroundthecorner separation of the bathroom and bedroom areas checkin was very fast the staff pulled up my name in seconds i had an excellent experience;5
i had an amazing experience with the hotel manager named yaya my dad was on a trip for his birthday and i wanted to surprise him with birthday balloons and more in his room she had a great attitude and helped me every step of the way with me not even being there in person her and her staff is very friendly and helpful thank you yaya for a great experience and for all of your help as well;5

upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to a stunning double room on the 29th floor with incredible views and the empire state building as the most perfect view the room is lovely spacious and airy very clean with extremely comfortable beds even with all the outside noise you should sleep ð¤ well the front of house staff have been just fantastic could not be more helpful any little problem they have sorted it we are currently on our third night out of 5 nights this hotel came highly recommended it is in the heart of nyc and everywhere is in with easy reach broadway is a 10 minute walk from the top end 10 minutes to the empire state building 15 minutes to ground zero highly recommend and if you shop around you can get some great rates for staying here;5
great place to stay and the breakfast is the the best plus the service marvin is the best as well as all the other staff the gym is a great place to take off the days pressure and the lounge relaxing with the fish tacos a big hit;5
stayed for 5 days in april really friendly staff great room and very big location was perfect and to be honest i really could not fault it breakfast was amazing loads of choice deffinetly recommend staying here universal studios is only 10 mins or so in an uber although apparently public transport was also very easy;5
due to snow in dallas and our flight canceled we had to stay a night again in this hotel we found it clean and all the staff was very helpful the room was clean and the bed was comfortable really like the shower when next in la we will stay there again;5
great place to stay fantastic rooms service amazing highly recommended roof terrace was great place for breakfast and sunset loved being given a local phone to call the riad if you get lost in the souks;5
when we arranged for the riad to come meet us we were led through dark and cramped alley ways until we arrived at door not knowing what to expect once the door opened it was simply paradise like your own piece of oasis in the middle of this busy bustling city the service was second to none nothing was too much trouble for them it was so calming being there the wifi is good and rooms are amazing breakfast in the rooftop terrace is excellent and a great variety of food if we ever go to marrakech again well definitely being staying here again;5
the hotel is great with splendid customer service julian did a great job taking care of my mother and me when it came to our bags and getting a hotel back to jfk my only complaints are that the breakfast wasnt the best for the price that we were charged and our toilet kept making noises throughout the night granted we didnt expect the best but we were in a rush and hoping for something more balanced for the price if i recall correctly it was approximately 11 as for the toilet noises it was distracting trying to fall asleep at night but was not horrendous overall stay was great though;5
after having been awake for over 24hrs my family was exhausted by the time we arrived at hilton universal city we were greeted by jerome at check in who was fantastic he went above and beyond to look after us and was the best first impression this hotel could have asked for thank you so much jerome for your warm welcome and a great start to our trip;5
we stayed in the new yorker whilst visiting for the new york marathon the staff were always friendly and helpful the rooms are clean and tidy the only thing i would say that is missing would be a kettle the location is great for visiting all the local attractions as you can walk to pretty much everything the bars and restaurants located within the hotel are also excellent a great hotel well worth a visit;5
we stayed from 23 to 28 december on the 20th floor in a standard queen check in was quick staff were friendly and welcoming offered upgrade options but didnt take it the room was as expected clean tidy and enough space for us and our cases the rooms were cleaned daily room service available and always staff on front desk security always asked for room key before accessing the lifts location great penn station on the doorstep main subway line and to our surprise madison sq garden opposite hotel entrance see photo would recommend hotel good value great location and lovely staff;5
this hotel definitely deserves its spot at number one their level of service and genuine hospitality is world class we stayed here for three nights earlier this month and had a fantastic time in the hotel from beginning to end every staff member was very enthusiastic and did so much for us they were aways offering coffee and tea and presenting everything so nicely we ordered about 5 bottles of moroccan wine during our stay and sat on the rooftop terrace it was always accompanied by delicious snacks too we were happy to see at the end that the wine was quite reasonable as well given how great it was and the service accompanied with it our highlight of marrakesh was drinking wine on the terrace and watching the sunset the value for what you get here is outstanding;5
we had a onenight stay and wanted to be close to universal studios everything about this place exceeded our expectations location staff pool roomeverything the staff we encountered throughout our stay were simply fantastic the concierge was super helpful and friendly when i bought my park tickets which were cheaper than those i had planned on purchasing online through universal he was very patient assisting the guests before me that had many questions and numerous requests the poolside server was exceptional i believe her name was violetta but not sure we had drinks and food by the pool and she delivered and set up an entire table for usthe entire experience by the pool was a highlight of our stay she was so friendly and made us feel so welcome;5
there are many riads to choose from in marrakech but i chose the riad kheirredine because of the reviews online it was even better than the reviews suggest it was our one year anniversary my wife is 6 months pregnant they made us as comfortable as possible nothing is too much for the staff when we first arrived tired hot from our journey we were welcomed in provided with warm rose watersoaked towels to clean up cool off we were then given a fine large breakfast of eggs pastries cakes bread pancakes fresh orange juice mint tea we stayed in the rose room which was beautifully decorated had an excellent ac system we took up the option of having dinner at the riad the chicken lamb tagines were outstanding they also come with a mountain of;5
i arrived at the hyatt at 200 am la time 600 my body clock time having not eaten for 16 hours nor slept for 23 hours and my one piece of luggage didnt make my flight what happened next i was greeted at the front desk with the warm friendly smiling face of jesus rosas lucky me explaining my situation he immediately pointed me in the direction of their marketplace still open for one of the most delicious sandwiches ever freshly made the young woman who took my order something like jennifer was all smiles despite the fact she was about to leave her early morning shift within the hour eagerly taking the efficient otis elevator to my floor the one i had requested in advance i found the badly needed gratis toothbrush and toothpaste hanging on my door;5
the hotel is one block from penn station handy if you are arriving by raillink from newark airport steps from madison garden and the beginning of the high line this grande dame from the 1920s has been carefully renovated and updated we had a view of the hudson and the glittering lights of the big city from our window the staff were welcoming and attentive the price was just right;5
beautiful hotel staff was helpful and attentive valet parking was easy pool was clean and warm hot tub was amazing beds were comfy bathrooms big and clean quiet in room breakfast was delicious and there was a lot to pick from;5
we stayed at the riad kheirredine in april and found the entire experience excellent perhaps some of that was good luck with the weather being great warm and sunny but not too hot and snow still on the mountains but most of the success of this trip is down to the attention from the riad staff to make sure we got the best from our stay exploring marrakech the souks the square and the alleyways could be a bit of an adventure but the hotel staff were always delighted to take us where we wanted to go if we wanted them to and they gave us a mobile phone so we could always call them to come and find us if we got lost or worried it all meant that we could explore with more confidence and so enjoy marrakech to the full and theres a lot to experience in marrakech we chose to;5
i am surprised how functional their tiny rooms are i booked a small room and it was really small yet very functional after all you do not spend too much time there i missed a kettle a bit but then you have complimentary hot water in the lobby tv set was there so were the hairdryer iron usb charging station hangers mirror clean linen toiletries no view from the window but iâve learnt it is quite normal in ny hotels i did not have breakfast there but you can have coffee there in the morning no coffee in the afternoon just hot water in the lobby location is superb 500m to central park or times square;5
what a find from the moment you enter youre in for a pleasant stay the staff couldnt be more service oriented dont expect posh surroundings do expect a very clean room bathroom down the hall etc even when the elevator isnt working its like youre in new york get over it ask to stay on one of the upper floors if noise is an issue i dont know what the deal is with the jane ballroom but dont expect to be let in i guess unless youre young and beautiful one block east and one block to the right is tortilla flats you cant find a restaurant with more character than this one every time ive stayed at the jane its been a pleasant experience and if its 3am and you cant sleep chat up the desk clerk;5
very helpful staff personal service always clean comfortable we felt us like at home only 1 thing we did not find gym but the are working on it to have it so it will be perfect place to stay;5
not one negative thing to say from checkin to checkout its been an amazing memorable stay upon arrival jerry greeted us at reception and couldnt be more inviting he informed us of the hotel facilities services and barpool opening times before handing over our room key he wished us a happy anniversary we later received a bottle of bubbly from the front desk staff which was a great start to our holiday the room was very clean comfortable and provided a great little base for our first time new york adventure fully recommend this place a stones throw away from the lincoln centre 10 minutes walk from times square and youre complimented with 2 metro stops close by grocery stores and a few great places to dine this was a romantic get away for my girlfriend and i and;5
i had an amazing stay at the empire hotel everything was clean and the service was on point my family and i truly had a wonderful time the moment we got out of our car the amazing doorman named tommy g was there right away to help us off load our car and to answer any other questions that we may have had about our stay i would definitely go back and spend another great weekend at this hotel;5
it was wonderfuljust researched on internet then went in a day before checking in to make sure and lorena at front desk was unbelievable in helping me due i couldnt tour the rooms ended up upgrading to a king superior room that was perfect had a beautiful view of the city which we didnt really even need but everywhere we went in the hotel they treated us very professionally and very knowledgable and answered all our questions staff at front door lounge bar rooftop baractually everywhere was top notch walking distance to everything again thank you lorenai know i came up several times and bothered you but you always had a smile and spent time with me to make sure i was taking care of my date i will be back;5
i noticed that a number of people complained about the size of the rooms in their reviews i can only assume that they have never stayed in a hotel in new york city especially near time square i have stayed at several hotels in the city and i can tell you that this hotel has similar size rooms as every other hotel the one difference is that this hotel is much nicer than most and it has a couple of restaurants in the hotel it is very conveniently located to time square and the convention center also the rooms are very clean and comfortable in fact the room i was in had a special thermostat for the tile in the bathroom this was awesome nothing like stepping out of a shower to a warm tile floor when it is in the teens outside the best part of this hotel is;5
first off the customer service provided by the entire staff especially curt h the front office manager was absolutely outstanding and both my dad and i were very impressed by this curt was very professional and helpful in recommending restaurants and cocktail bars that are really close by after checking out on sunday he even gave me a hotel key card to use across the street at the new york sports club which they have a partnership with so guests can use anytime during their stay this gym i must mention is also impeccable it has multiple levels with everything you could possibly need for and after your workout our room was very clean with new furnishings although we didnt spend much time in the room just as anyone visiting new york with so much to see and do it;5
a reasonably priced hotel for new york for sure in a great location for a fun touristy trip walk to the theaters sights shopping time squareits on the metro close to the river tons of restaurants the hotel is vintage the rooms are small no surprise a little noisy but to be expected for the era nice front desk good security theres a person checking room keys by the elevators definitely stay again;5
the hotel is in a great location especially if you goto jfk or newark by train as penn station is on the corner i sadly booked the wrong night and we found out when i turned up thankfully mohammad at reception was able to find a solution for us he was really professional and empathetic this is hard to find at the moment as so many hotels are understaffed we did have to book the accommodation again but he was quick in finding a fair solution a big thanks to mohammad the room was standard clean and ok the small size but this is quite normal for new york city we had a great view over midtown and the diner downstairs was great for breakfast we would recommend this hotel and stay at again;5
stayed here march 2019 hotel right across from madison square garden diner attached to hotel a wonderful place to eat breakfast diner open 247 hotel is half block from penn station so if arriving by train you only have to drag your suitcases half block to hotel art deco style of hotel;5
we spend three nights at this hotel on our recent road trip check in was swift and efficient complimentary wifi offered room well appointed and spacious beds comfortable and bedding of a high quality great location for universal and also downtown la concierge offered great advice and we had a great day using the metro on our own tour of the city tickets for universal purchased from the hotel and free shuttle bus offered which was great after a long day we did not eat at the hotel but we did use the bar and coffee bar which were excellent pool is fantastic too loved this hotel;5
i stayed in this hotel for about 6 days in the beginning of january with a friend it was our first trip to nyc and we had just moved from a hotel in times square the front desk customer service was very friendly and helped us find the gentleman in charge of storing luggage he was not extremely friendly but had been dealing with big tour groups all day the luggage room they have isnt very large and some of it is just roped off in the lobby so do not store anything valuable the hotel itself looked like an apartment building converted into a hotel and was old but everything was clean and the bathroom in our room was recently redone we didnt have any problems with noise even from the street all of the shifts at the front desk were pleasant and helpful in giving us;5
this hotel provided excellent accommodations we visited and travel often and couldnt have been happier the hotel was very clean provided good service and the parking was easy we will return and recommend;5

stepping through the door of the riad kheirredine from the crazy bustling streets of marrakech is like arriving in heaven itâs a beautifully chic interior is welcoming and calm the staff are all warm and friendly and the service is second to none every detail has been thought through we were even given a phone so we could call them any time if we got lost or needed help whilst out and about if we ever go back to marrakech we wouldnt consider staying anywhere else it was truly wonderful;5
i stayed here recently for 4 nights with my husband and son mainly to visit universal studios we are hilton honor members and this was one of the most professional and efficient hiltons we have ever stayed in check in was fast the man at the desk gave us all the information in regards to the hotel we needed for our stay he then walked us to the elevators and sent us on our way to our room on the executive level the room had a great view of universal studios it was very clean with everything we needed each afternoon we would receive a tray of fresh fruit cookies chocolates cake and bottled waterwow what a treat walking to universal is pretty easy once you do it for the first time if you dont like to walk approx 10 mins the hotel has a free shuttle bus;5
ive visited this hotel with my friend last week it was our second time in nyc but our first time in astor on the park we were a little bit worried about the location but when we arrived those worries were all gone it is a great location across the street from central park and only 3 minutes away from the subway even a taxi can bring you back to your hotel from almost every central location for about 10 till 15 the room was small but enough to sleep in it there was airconditioning in the room and was even left on the whole day and not shut down by the roommaid in the hotel theres a small elevator where fits 4 people sometimes you have to wait a long time but thats the only bad thing because the hotel is located at the street you can hear some traffic;5
the front desk staff had a wealth of information and multiple options for each question i asked whether it was a dinner recommendation directions to a nearby attraction or how to best catch my flight;5
we will stay at this hotel again on the way back from maui in a suite they were huge and the regency lounge was excellent the manager christian and the front desk staff were very welcoming and speedy see ya soon;5

we recently spent 4 nights in this beautiful riad for our first visit to marrakech and we couldnt have been happier with our choice a driver met us on arrival at the airport and took us the 15 minutes into marrakech where we were escorted on foot by a member of staff to the riad here we were greeted by the lovely elena and a pot of morrocan tea our room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable cleaned daily and always stocked with fresh fruit and bottled water food is a big part of the kheirredine experience the breakfasts are huge every drink ordered comes with something to nibble on and if you choose to eat in the morrocan salads and tagines are delicious there are a couple of lovely restaurants very close to the riad which the staff will happily book for;5
its difficult to add anything new to what has already been said about the riad kheirredine but we feel obliged to write a post due to the wonderful service we received during our 5 night stay both my partner and i have travelled a fair bit around the world staying in some highly rated hotels but nothing has beaten this riad in terms of quality of service we opted for the kheirredine due to the excellent reviews on trip advisor and the staff lived up to the reviews in every way we booked direct with valentina and yajaria via email and they were so helpful and made booking our stay simple and hassle free they offered us a traditional meal in the riad on our first night which we would highly recommend as the food was both fantastic and good value for money valentina;5

three of us went to nyc for a long weekend and had a metro view room initially the room given to us had a view though not entirely what we had been hoping for but the hotel was very full that night they offered to move us to another room for the 2nd through 4th nights and held our luggage for us while we enjoyed the city our new room was fantastic i could lay in bed and see the empire state building the room was spotless the beds were very comfortable and our room was a very comfortable size especially for nyc we interacted with many of the staff during our stay and they were all so friendly and accommodating we ate in two of the restaurants and the food was very good the location is terrific with easy access to the subway lirr or amtrak and also within walking;5

me and my girl stayed for a weekend celebrating our anniversary and had a wonderful time emanuel at the front desk made sure we had the best possible service throughout our whole stay and we were really happy with our junior suite;5
stayed at virtually all price ranges and locations among the very best experiences in 30 years of travel large enough to be fully staffed and offer range of services not common to hotels of this size yet feels incredible intimate without being precious i believe hotel dates from 20s and is of course full updated i mention because room size is excellent for a hotel of this size and the layout allows the rooms to have light and air probably not a great fit for younger children but incredibly would probably please both suburban couple getaway and hipper crowd as well;5
stopped by the jane have always wanted to stay there and got a wonderful tour by christopher this place is really a cool building the rooms share a coed bathroom very european but there are rooms that are ensuite with patios too this was really a fun place near the highline too;5
i stayed in this hotel on business a few months ago and cannot find anything remotely negative to say the hotel itself is easily 4 star and the customer service was exceptional from start to finish sometimes i find that hotels treat business travellers a little different to those on vacation however everyone appeared to be treated the same and with the utmost courtesy i was so impressed that i have booked this hotel for my wifes 50th birthday celebration and her first trip to new york at the end of november this year highly recommended;5
i was there to attend a wedding so i wasnt able to enjoy the amenities the staff was great and friendly i arrived early so our room wasnt ready i forgot her name but the older woman at the desk let me know i can enjoy the amenities while i waited i was upgraded because of hilton status and the room was beautiful especially the bathroom where i took advantage of the soaking rub the tall black gentleman who checked us was polite and friendly i would definitely come back for a longer stay;5

my husband and i stayed at this hotel during a fall weekend we live in philadelphia and we were able to take the commuter train and then catch amtrak penn station was just across the street we lucked out our room was one that was handicapped accessible not only was it spacious but we had a view of the empire state building we were in walking distance of many of the sightsalthough some people stated in their reviews that the lobby needed to be updated i thought that the lobby was part of the hotels art deco charm;5
great location for a trip to universal studios the hotel is very nice service is excellent room is very nice and the restaurant serves great food were sorry we missed the evening buffet it looked awesome very reasonable price;5
food is amazing and delivery was fast and cute to joke anyway the portion of food is perfect not little but just enough to satisfy your hunger also first time that i was able to eat the whole meal usually at the very end i loose my appetite or interest on my food because of the taste but your food is so tasty i dont mind seconds lol;5
i was really impressed with this place on arrival the man at reception was very polite and helpfull the room was alot bigger than i expected with a sink wardrobe desk and fridge we had a twin room with shared bathroom facilities the showers were ok clean but for what you pay for this place you cannot complain the hostel is only a 15 minute tube ride away from the centre of london and the hostel iteself is a 2 minute walk from the hammersmith tube station my only critizism of this place would be that is it currently being converted from the hospital it once was meaning there was scaffolding outside or window so on a hot day i didnt really want to leave the window open and we were awoken at about 9 in the morning by building work but i would definately reccomend;5
i stayed here for one night of august 17 after reading the reviews below i was really apprehensive about the hotel but i was pleasantly surprised i really dont know where some of these people who wrote the bad reviews could be coming from i arrived 130 and asked if early checkin was possible gizelle one of the two young women working the day shift said a room would be ready shortly i took a seat in the lobby and started giving it a good look since i had time on my hands and was trying to see what was wrong with it i saw beautiful marble floors very tasteful lobby furniture and accessories decorating the area three rolling luggage racks on the ready for people to load their luggage onto dont know what that one reviewer was saying when she said she;5

we visited marrakech to celebrate our wedding anniversary and selected riad kheirredine based on the fantastic reviews iâm so glad we did all four of us have travelled a fair amount over the years and we all agreed that rk provided the best hotel service any of us have ever experienced forget dubai singapore or mauritius all have fantastic hotels but nothing compares to the bespoke service the team provide at this beautiful 13 room riad most decent hotels have nicelavish rooms well selected furnishings and good fooddrinks but the crucial factor here is the staff every one of them is friendly polite and will do anything they can to exceed your expectations you cannot understand the level of service until you experience it breakfast was of the highest quality;5

we had an amazing stay at the new yorker and would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in nyc mohammed on reception went out of his way to make this an extra special trip by helping us upgrade following our engagement a trip we will never forget;5
we just needed a hotel for a one night stay near lax and my research on tripadvisor didnât disappoint an easy 12km walk 20 mins which was nice after a long haul flight or there is a shuttle bus if you prefer that rooms are a very good size and incredibly sound proof considering how close you are to the airport good showers and comfortable beds and pillows check in was efficient staff friendly and a good sports bar downstairs for a drink and feed would stay here again for sure;5
stayed here as part of my 30th birthday with my husband on arrival my husband mentioned the celebration we were upgraded to a king room which was great spacious clean great views and big comfy bed its was in a great location 10 mins from central park and times square the staff were all very nice and happy to help at anytime espcially elizabeth jeff and julian who on our departure arranged a limo to pick us up at last min as we struggled to get a taxi arriving at the airport in style was the best way to end an amazing stay the only 1 thing i would say could have made the hotel a little better would be free wifi so at the of the night we could have chilled out in our room rather than sit in the lobby all in all though a great stay we will defo be returning to this hotel in the;5

my girlfriend and i stayed here in november the staff were very accomodating when we booked in after our late arriving flight and were generally very helpful and accomodating the hotel was nice and very clean the hotel is not in the centre of where all the action is going on in ny but we actually preffered this as we got to see a bit of the less touristy side of ny in any case it is close to both 103rd and 110th street stations where you can pick up the 1 train however we generally walked through the park down towards 96th street where you can pick up an express train into midtown the hotel is opposite central park which is also a bonus and we had an oblique park view also taking in the empire state which was realy good bad points were that the lift is slow although;5

i visited riad kheirredine for the first time with my partner in may 2018 it exceeded our expectations in just about every way possible our room was beautifully appointed and even had a small but cost courtyard style balcony the riad itself is kept in tip top conditionthey were even touching up the paintwork during our stay which is always a good sign the hotel management staff and management were supremely helpful with a special thanks going to sara and elena for looking after us the only way to describe riad kheirredine is as a five star boutique hotel they place was apparently fully booked during our stay and yet never seemed overly busy thanks in part to the numerous seating areas located throughout the riad the roof terrace area in particular was out of;5
we absolutely loved the new yorker i doubt you could find a better location its right next to a subway stop and just a short walk to another subway that gives you access to loads of different lines its a relatively easy walk to times square and down to hudson yardshighline the tick tock diner attached is also great and we started most days with a bagel around the corner on 34th street head towards hudson yards you are also right next to madison square garden we went to see billy joel there so it was fantastic we had booked two rooms and both were upgraded so we had an amazing view of the empire state building from one window and the city from the other its a beautiful old style hotel and because its not super modern some of the features such as the;5

this was the 4th place we stayed in morocco and it was intended to be a bit of relaxing luxury after trekking about in the mountains and it certainly did not disappoint as the riad is near impossible to find the first time we were met at our taxi and led there through winding back streets as you enter the small entrance door you emerge into a beautiful oasis of cool peace and tranquility a stark contrast to the noisy marrakech streets we were warmly welcomed with tea and biscuits and shown our gorgeous room drinks and snacks are included and the food is superb they even bought in decaf coffee for us and will do everything they can to cater for the fussiest palette my husband was unfortunately ill when he arrived and the staff fell over themselves to fetch him;5

you will have seen a multitude of excellent reviews for this riad and there is a good reason for this the riad kheirredine is an outstanding place to stay i could talk about the wonderful architecture of the hotel the peace and tranquility it affords amid the hustle and bustle of the medina its comfortable and luxurious rooms or its excellent kitchen the breakfasts which can be taken at any time are truly memorable but the one thing that stands out is the incredible warmth of the hospitality from everyone you encounter you genuinely feel that you a part of a family there is nothing the staff wont do for you and you would have to be a very jaded traveller not to be overwhelmed by the kindness and courtesy you receive if you are coming to marrakesh this riad is;5

we stayed at the hotel for four nights in august in one of the club rooms expected an airport hotel to be very impersonal but the service in the club lounge was anything but cairo the lounge manager was so friendly and welcoming to us he went out of his way to help and every evening helped prepare a dessert plate of all the tasty cookies and cakes that were available so that we could take these to our room his hospitality and service levels went well beyond expectations;5

as a repeat customer i enjoyed my stay here for two nights the king alcove room was very spacious and had a great panoramic view of the mountains the park and the freeway the room appeared to be recently renovated and the bed very comfortable it was quiet for the entire stay the continental breakfast was good but the last time i stayed i was able to select my own items from the buffet on a limited basis this time the server brought me a selection of pastries and yogurt i would much rather selfservice it was almost like they did not trust you to get your own food even if it means selecting a limited number of items from the full buffet the staff was professional and welcoming on every occasion the area surrounding the hotel is great for walking expect;5
arrival was very smooth the lobby was quiet round 1300 so check in was very fast and we had wonderful service from mohammed who provided us a room on a high floor for city views and complimentary early check in as the room was available the room itself had everything we required although being a new york property it was small in size and very dated but the bed was very comfortable and we had a nice view across manhattan we didnt use any of the hotel facilities but were aware there was a gym in the basement of the hotel the only downside is being charged the service fee for using the property that i dont agree with and to make things worse on top of this the hotel also charge 5 per item of luggage for storage until heading to the airport later that day this is a;5
we got one of those priceline express deals where you dont know which hotel you are getting until youve bought it we were pleasantly surprised with a clean room with two standard beds a clean bathroom an efficient cheerful checkin very personable valet parking and a helpful guy behind the desk at the information counter true there were a lot of people around in the lobby and there were always other people on the elevator and the room was compact id definitely return thoughwithout hesitation;5

ok so i read a lot of reviews for this hotel before i decided where to stat and unless your review is a 5 star review then you must complain about everything imaginable i am not here to complain about a piece of wallpaper that wasnt glued properly or a tv that isnt big enough or waiting more then 10 seconds for an elevator if you stay here for family vacation for universal like we did you will be happy we walked to universal and the city walk each of the 3 days we stayed there you can ride the shuttle but we walked it 5 minutes and you are there we stayed on the 11th floor with a view of the park and were perfectly fine without upgrading to a higher floor the pool was nice it was heated the area was clean you can get drinks down by the pool water was nice;5
staying at this hotel was great we say an excellent price on hotelrooms365com for 99 a night when we checked into the hotel on july 12th we were so amazed by how good it looked for such a low price at first we had one queen size bed but we met the front desk clerk and asked her for a room with double beds and she let us switch for free central park in right across the street i would recommend to take the subway train on 103rd street its alot closer and also safer my best friend and i had a wonderful time in new york the hotel guest were pretty nice we met such great people here also i would recommend the c train because it takes you to timesquare canal street etc the d train takes you to coney island staying here at this hotel was great its right;5

my boyfriend and i stayed at the empire last week as it was our anniversary and his birthday nicole very kindly upgraded us and sent a complimentary bottle of champagne to the room to help us celebrate the special occasions it really meant a lot and i cant speak highly enough of all the staff members we encountered during our stay the room was lovely and as it was on the tenth floor we had an amazing view of the lincoln centre and street below i love the decor of the hotel its very cool and gothic the only downside of the empire is the fact you have to pay for coffee in the room we just popped down to starbucks on the corner instead the subway is right outside so its a perfect location for seeing the city well definitely be back and id like to say a big thank you;5
walking distance to universal with shuttle available to universal shops and restaurants good hotel for families felt safe walking to and from with my kids close enough to relax midday and get out of heat then gp back to universal;5
as with many reviewers we booked this place on the basis of its outstanding ranking on trip advisor overall i have to say that the riad met our expectations across the board we have never felt as looked after and the staff from hotel management to wait staff and cleaners were very friendly and 100 concerned that we were happy with our stay i could wax lyrically about this place for hours however id just like to address a couple of the criticisms others have made 1 location it is about a 10 min walk to the start of the market area and 20 mins to the main square its a lot quieter in the immediate area around the riad which isnt a bad thing you avoid all the touristy nonsense that goes on in the heart of the medina yes its easy to get lost but the riad staff are;5

this was my 2nd visit this year we first visited in feb and were so impressed decided to return in november with our 14 year old boy marrakech is not for the inexperienced traveller but if you want to broaden your horizons and get excellent weather away from a beach style holiday then dont stay anywhere else apart from this riad i thought it couldnt get any better than our feb visit but guess what it can i have been a travel agent for 35 years and have never experienced such a quality hotel as this believe all those great reviews so thank you again to cinzia valentina elenaali and noah and those staff whos names i never got we love you all if you ever wish to come to scotland then you are all welcome to stay with us;5

we like to stay at hilton hotels and this was the closest hilton to universal studios it did have a tram to take guest to the studio but the hours were not very convenient so we just walked it was about a five minute walk not bad at all the hotel was doing some remodeling but it did not interfere with our stay the room was nice and the bathroom was large the only problem with the bathroom was the layout and the fact that there was nowhere to hang your towel close to the sink the shower was great we would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting universal studios;5

great hotel with great service i hate to say it but the rooms are tiny but clean and the queen size beds even seem smaller but the location beats it all we were hardly even in the room with everything so close around this hotel you it wont matter that the rooms are so small apparently this is normal for new york hotels we didnt have a coffee maker so we asked at the front desk for one they told us someone will be up right a way it sure wasnt right away but they brought a small keurig with a few bottles of water and a big variety of k cups and sugar and powder creamer napkins cups etc all in all we were very pleased and would choose this hotel again;5
the views are awesome the location is great personal a bit robotic but its a nyc hotel they have a lot to deal with it was a great stay shame on the luggage that we had to carry out through ny last day because of the early check out maybe a service or space to keep to lugagge in the hotel could be nice;5
at checkin mohammed informed us that we had been upgraded to a family suite we loved the view and the extra space was very much appreciated the location of the hotel made it so handy to catch the subway the lirr or just go for a nice walk to many of the nearby restaurants we feel that the few extra dollars was well worth it;5

i stayed in this hotel 20 years ago when it was already nice but now that its newly refurbished it is really great the lobby is supercomfortable for lounging and free wifi the beds are really soft and big there is no breakfast included in the room price and one has to go out to get ones own breakfast the location is next to the lincoln center 5 mins to the central park and the john lennon house as well as columbus circle and broadway very comfortable and urban luxury stay earplugs recommended because either its loud from the street side or loud from the aircondition noise in the inner court but thats ny;5
we got back from morocco about a week ago after a stay of 5 days at riad kheirredine absolutely highly recommend this beautiful place to stay if you are in marrakech the customer service is outstanding best we have ever encountered on all of our travels around the world the riad itself is gorgeous moroccan in style but very classy and calming in color we stayed in the safron jr suite which had plenty of room for us to relax in every morning we ate a delicious breakfast on the roof top when we would leave for the day we were sent off with smiles and excitement for our travels for the day when we would come back the girls in the office would stop us before we got very far in the door to find out what fun we had that day and offer us mint tea and cookies to freshen;5

the empire hotel is a very upscale and happening place to stay its overall location is great the staff was overwhelmingly helpful nick at the front desk saw to it that we had a great room with awesome views of the city he was also overall very nice and eager to help the rooftop bar was ehh not because of the place itself but more so for its pretentious clientele most of them looked like rejects from some teen drama on the cw station but i have to say if you like to goof off its a great place for photo bombs overall we loved our stay and would come back;5
we had the pleasure of staying in the riad for a long weekend even before we arrived the team there answered all emails promptly and organised a few things for us all of which were excellent we booked the transfer which is recommended as the riad is not easy to find a member of staff met us at the taxi drop off and walked us to the riad the welcome was warm with tea and dates and lots of useful information the best help for new visitors is the smart phone provided as it can be helpful if you donât have data services the team is excellent friendly and no question stays unanswered i would highly recommend and if we are returning to marrakesh this will be our place to stay;5

im not going to lie but i was dreading this hotel due to all the bad coverage its been getting from the minute i arrived i loved it if you are like us and on a budget this hotel is fab the reception staff were helpful and the maid service was spot on with clean bedding and towels every day of our visit if you go out of the hotel and go left and then take the 1st left again and walk to the end there is a little grocery shop that sells hot food perfect place to pick up a breakfast muffin on the go 4 blocks from the subway station at either side and you arent ever on the train longer that 1520 minutes to get anywhere the subway is the fastest and best way to get from hotel to downtown 31 gets you a 7 day unlimited pass for the subway if you are doing more than a few;5
love everything starting with the people in the front desk to the rooms and the hotel decor i have to say that everything was excellent patrick was really nice and polite love him and kathleen canât wait to go back really close to central park lot of stores to do some shopping for fam and friends if you are that kind of âgalâ if you thinking on having a romantic getaway or to just spend a couple of nights out of the chaos this is your place really quite and full of sights;5

we had stayed at this hilton 2 years ago and had a dreadful experience but due to the close location to universal we decided to try the hotel againand am very glad that we did the staff was tremendously helpful and friendly a vast difference in our prior visit the rooms were very clean and spacious with comfortable beds and excellent views we had continental breakfast and it was fantastic best ever the pool was lovely but the hot tub could have been a bit hotter and cleaner but the walkable location to universal was key for a short visit there were issues with the elevators but staff did try and accommodate highly recommend;5
this hotel is a short easy hotel shuttle ride from lax and really fits the bill for everything you would want in an airport hotel it is clean efficient modern and the beds are super comfortable the hotel has an excellent breakfast buffet an airy lobby great wifi and nice showers the staff makes clear they are at your service and really want to make your stay a good one my only suggestion would be an upgrade in towels which in my opinion were fine but not as nice as they should be for a hotel of this calibre;5
my 16 year old son and i stayed at the hilton for four days at the end of a 2 week trip to the usa visiting east central and western states arrival we arrived in a prebooked taxi from anaheim and the door staff were opening the car doors and greeting us before we even realised we had stopped at the entrance checkin was swift efficient and friendly and we were in our room within 5 minutes of arrival room we had a superb executive level room with fantastic views out across universal studios and the surrounding hills lots of space supremely comfortable beds and pillows and a large luxury bathroom everything was spotlessly clean and the airconditioning kept it cool and comfortable wireless hook up for the laptop was really simple and not too expensive food a;5

had a great time staff was good location was excellent room was nice and clean what else can i ask for i was surprised that a coffee cost money but i hear that all hotels these days charge;5
from the moment we arrived the staff at the riad kheirredine treated us like family we were aunt niece traveling together they gave us a phone so we could always reach them they made sure we were safe by having taxis ready for us as well as walkers i cannot say enough about sarah and her staff i have traveled 99 countries always stayed in luxury 5 star hotels and never have i had such a phenomenal experience the breakfast which was included was fit for a queen drinks on the rooftop overlooking the city was breathtaking and the lamb tangine was extraordinary i also cannot say enough about morocco and the people so kind and so at peace all the cities from casablanca rabat fes the atlas mountains erfoud the sahara were amazing but there;5
thanks tripadvisor for finding this gem of a boutique hotel tucked away in the old city about a 10 minute walk to the souks its a tranquil oasis where you can relax and be thoroughly looked after by all of the lovely staff they have thought of practically everything from the inclusive tea and coffee all day to the free loundry service nothing is too much trouble they provided us with a smartphone with a map of the medina so we could navigate around the city and call them if we got lost and escorted us to the edge of the souks if we wanted breakfast on the roof terrace was an absolute delight i very much enjoyed my massage and the prices in the spa are a fraction of what we would pay in the uk well done all the staff at riad kheirredine you should be proud of;5
my wife and i stayed two nights a week ago at the riad kheirredine it was simply an outstanding excellent experience simply wish we had stayed longer we arrived from casablanca and was met by the driver with a sign of the riad driven a short drive of about 1015min to a main square where they drop you off we were met by ali i believe and your bags are put into a cart and off they go you just follow along the narrow alleys to the riad a nice short stroll on arrival we did our check in while seated we had cold towels and lovely mint tea our hostess on arrival and orientation was elena she was out going and just made you feel totally relaxed and glad to have arrived the riad provides a mobile phone its programmed with three numbers all;5

this hotel is literally right next to universal studios they say 10 minute walk but thats way overestimating there is also a shuttle that runs between the hotel and citywalk in case you dont want to walk the lobby is large and beautiful front desk staff was very helpful in getting us checked in and answering any questions we had the beds were super soft and very comfortable our room was overlooking the pool and we were on the 15th floor the hotel is very nice but expensive in my opinion but im glad we stayed there and we would probably stay there again for special occasions the cost of parking is outrageous though;5

from the moment that i made an enquiry to stay here i knew i had found somewhere special my husband and i stayed for three days and loved every moment from the wonderful rooftop bar and seating area the comfortable and stylish seating areas and our huge beautiful room to the immaculate service we received the place was teaming with friendly and helpful staff who couldnât do enough to help we were given a mobile phone to use if we were lost and guided into the mã©dina each day marrakech can be quite confusing but staying at the kheirredine was so reassuring;5
me and my hubby are just home after having stayed at the ameritania for 4 nights what can i say from the moment we arrived until the moment we left everyone was friendly the room whilst small was spotlessly clean tidy and my goodness the bed was super comfortable and the shower just perfect we were standing scratching our heads wondering what direction to take on our first venture out and we were rescued by jeff who sat with us for 10 minutes explaining uptown and downtown and highlighting a map suggesting ways to walk or what trains to take on the underground this was so helpful so big shout out to jeff and thanks so much the hotel location is just fab 5 minute walk and you were in times square or central park yes the room is noisy but didnât expect it to be a;5

i love good airport hotels this is one of them i have an obsession about staying close to the airport the night before early flights out or when i arrive late into town and this one is my favourite at lax it was unexpected because i dont expect much from airport hotels but the renovation that was done was high quality recent and the price was great i will be back when i walked in late at night about 4 people greeted me with very cheery genuine smiles and i thought that was a good sign because it means they are so happy to work there even so late pretty much everything was flawless the breakfast my limo which they ordered for me to travel to west hollywood and the room only downside is that taking the shuttle can be a pain at lax but it arrived very quickly;5
my partner and i stayed here as our first destination arriving from australia we were able to checkin a bit earlier which was a godsend as we were extremely jetlagged we stayed for 4 nights the location is brilliant as it isnt in the hype of hollywood and only a very short walk to the metro and a short train trip to most places we also caught the bus as well and this was the same distance to the train station when you compare staying right in hollywood and the price you have to pay and then you can stay here where the price is a lot cheaper with just a short trainbus trip to most places i thoroughly recommend it the staff were always friendly and helpful with any of our queries;5

i was going to nyc to see elton john and was to stay at the new yorker well neither happened i had made nonrefundable reservations but called the hotel to see if their policy would change during this crisis every person i spoke to was so nice and helpful one person that really stood out was neida aldama a supervisor at the front desk she was incredibly kind and compassionate about the situation and offered that my prepayment be used as a credit that i can apply anytime in the next year hopefully ifwhen elton john reschedules i feel that this was very generous given the fact that they had every right to tell me i was sol neida even went so far as to call me to directly answer a question i had i know that they are dealing with a lot and are working with a;5

this hotel is across the street from universal studios about a 5 minute walk up hill and up some stairs or you can take the shuttle service the shuttle service is not run by hotel but by universal studios so the times are not so good during the week it ends at 430pm but on the weekends it runs from open until 9pm the service is great the rooms are clean and modern with a lot of amenities we had a great view to the park the beds have very soft linens and the toiletries are peter thomas roth we received a very nice plate of fresh fruit a tin with chocolate and gourmet trail mix on arrival in our room and two bottles of water we were traveling with family and requested rooms next to eachother and they actually came through and we even had adjoining rooms;5

have stayed here a couple of times traveling with my kids in los angeles the staff is always very friendly and the rooms are nice with great views walking distance to universal citywalk ordered breakfast off the menu instead of the buffet but would just go with the buffet next time currently they are upgrading their elevators to be faster so at least one of the four is not in service but never had to wait a long time for the elevator during our stay;5
i was looking for a reasonable place to stay in manhattan took a chance on the jane hotel this is down a tree lined street right by the hudson river the bellhop met me at the bottom of the stairs and offered to carry my bags immediately the front desk staff were gracious and welcoming the bell hop explain how to work the electricity and showed me every detail to make my stay as comfortable as possible the rooms were clean the bathrooms are down the hall and i thought being spoiled californian it might present a problem as it turns out not at all its two showers two bathrooms two sinks and a hair dryer and really no one else is in there using it so i felt very comfortable they have a lovely restaurant downstairs serving moroccan food;5
got upgraded to a suite due to being a diamond member helpful staff room was big enough good powerful shower daily housekeeping great location good security downstairs required us to show keycards to enter hotel part of the new yorker good experience overall thanks;5
we had a great experience at the hilton near universal studios the location cant be beat it was directly across universal studios so this made the trip very relaxing in our opinion the extra cost to stay here was worth it so we could just wake up and walk to the park about 10 minutes or so it also was nice so we could walk to the restaurants outside of universal studios and then head home when we were ready the hotels does offer a shuttle to universal studios which we took once since the walk there is uphill but its really not needed for walking back our room faced universal studios which was awesome we could see the harry potter area from our room lots of food options in the hotel and the room while simple was clean and had what we needed only;5
my wife and i attended a 3 day convention and every thing was top notch had a very convenient and short walk to universal studios and the attached street mall great view of the inside of universal studios theme park from some rooms and views of the surrouding foothils from the other rooms only oddity was the walk way from the lobbyelevator area was lined on both sides with buffet food if i was eating there i would not want everyone not eating walking within inches of all the food i was planning on eating very attractive food displays i must say though the business center computer would not print my boarding pass but a very helpful staff member took me to his office and let me use his setup;5

i head to universal studios for my birthday every year possible probably for the last ten years now i love the hilton hotel for its friendly service great rooms and convenient location it can get a little on the expensive side versus staying at some hotels a few miles away but i am willing to pay it i dont need to fight traffic in the morning and i can even take a short ride by bus or subway to hollywood;5
prior to arriving at the riad our day has not gone well our direct flight from london had been rebooked by british airways to a flight via casablanca and during the process our only bag had got lost we emailed the riad to let them know things were not going well and they rearranged our collection from the airport provided a snack for our arrival and got the necessities we required to at least settle in from there on in things only got better they arranged a taxi to take us to buy clothes and gave us a mobile phone to allow us to contact them every member of staff whom we met couldnât do enough for us the bed was extremely comfortable the breakfast included in our room rate was excellent with high quality produce used the free flowing tea coffee and fruit juices were;5
spent 4 nights at the empire with my husband on our honeymoon glad we didnt book the basic room we overheard someone yelling at the lady on reception that he had never seen such a small room and with a view of a brick wall our room was wonderful everything you need and a good view great location for exploring manhattan and the subway is a stones throw from the hotel and a 5 minute walk to the nearest branch of whole foods for breakfast and supplies the cocktail bar looked good but we didnt get chance to try it overall good value for manhattan and great location but dont book the tiny rooms pay more for a better room;5

we selected this hotel primarily for its upper west side midtown location it is directly across the street from lincoln center which clearly adds to its appeal for those headed for the metropolitan opera the new york city ballet and the ny philharmonic we were upgraded from a deluxe king to a junior suite a very pleasant surprise our room was most comfortable very clean be advised that the empire is not new the lobby has been beautifully redecorated the halls are attractive there is a small but good exercise facility but our room did not have a fully usable closet with a door and enough space so that a winter coat could hang down fully without encroaching into the hallway but there was a safe and a refrigerator filled with very expensive goodies and booze and;5
went to the riad for four days this june and it was spectacular beyond exceeded my expectations everything was taken care of the rooms were clean and breakfast was amazing we went on two excursions essaouira and imlil and both were unbelievable the staff was so friendly and accommodating we had night guardians and people to show us around at all times they went above and beyond to show us a great time at one point they went out and bought us cards when they didnât have any i also was staying with two friends who were dating we stayed in the yasmine room which had two floors and two separate bathrooms canât reccomend this place enough;5
we chose the new yorker because it was in an art deco building and we were not disappointed the front desk staff were great and all around the hotel the building has been well decorated to show the art deco features the view from our 48th floor suite of the new york skyline just great close to a subway station and bus stop so very easy to get around new york our 4 day stay was most enjoyable;5

we went to celbrate our daughers 30th birthday with her partner and two other couples friends of theirs we had free transfers from the airport as we were staying for four nights we had a beautiful suite with shower and bath the rooms were all styled differently there was a wonderful roof terrace on different levels with huge comfy sofas to lounge on and bowls of fresh fruit the views over the old medina were lovely and all you heard were the calling to prayers from all the various towers you could see around you you could also see the atlas mountains in the distance each day one couple had a hamman and massage which was a wonderful experience the staff from the top to the bottom were all wonderfuly friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble staff took;5
we decided to book here for our weeks stay in new york city as it was very central we were politely greeted and allocated our room the room was clean and for a few extra dollars we requested a fridge one downside of our room was that it was very small however we did not ask for another perhaps they would of upgraded us if we had enquired the gym was very good and the lobby toilets were impeccably clean we ordered room service from the restaurant tick tock that is joined on to the hotel which was great we would like to say how wonderful the lady is that tended to our room 3129 her name is elena p i think her surname began with she is a lovely serbian lady she was friendly always smiling and made us feel so welcome and important she very much added to our good;5
a laid back art deco styled hotel gracious foyer plenty of space and friendly staff its not a 5 star hotel but it is everything you need great location to penn station access to train network very useful walk to central park or world trade centre site for some exercise the prices seemed good value to me room a bit tight but i didnt pay for a suite good place if you are out all day;5
we stayed at this hotel for a change from the hampton in sherman oaks which was under construction so the cost is about 80 more at the hilton which includes the 28 parking fee but the hotel is gorgeous impeccably clean the outside pool area is an oasis from the la hubbub we were upgraded to the floor below the top one which overlooked la and universal studios and of course the la traffic its an easy easy 10 min walk to universal studios but the best thing about this hotel are the people from the people behind the desk to the housekeepers to security to the pool attendants everyone was polite friendly professional and went above and beyond for example on friday afternoon and we had had some coffee and doughnuts at universal we decided to;5
itâs all about location here the proximity to universal studios makes this hotel a goto for any visit to the area but you do pay for that privilege rooms rates are high breakfast charges are high and parking charges are outrageous there is a shuttle to universal studios and city walk that stops outside the main entrance to the hotel but it goes to the sheraton first so is occasionally full when it gets to the hilton particularly the first few trips in the morning you can walk uphill about 89 minutes to get to the park main entrance staff is friendly rooms are spacious and clean;5
riad kheirredine is a wonderful place to stay located in marrakesh medina we loved our stay there and we can only say good things about it the hotel itself is very charming and well decorated it has two nice swimming pools the staff is attentive and helpful the room was big and comfortable breakfast was great and i believe they really have an outstanding service to client the location is perhaps the riads weakness because it is in the middle of a very labyrinthine area of the medina however they provided us with a cell phone so that we could call anytime and someone picked us where we were and yes they were available to do that anytime it was also nice that they recommended places to visit and really good restaurants even if they had their own restaurant they;5

ive spend a week here in february and enjoyed it very much great service at the bar from gabriel the only thin i disliked and it wa my ow fault was the fact that as a european i didnt know i was supposed to tip the maid as well and the reception at the front desk was suddenly very cold when i came to retreive my bags even though i tipped anyone else it was an honest mistake;5
great hotel clean close to universal studios you can walk there or take a shuttle although at times the shuttle can delay matthew and his staff are great met him at the checkin counter soon after we experienced our 1st ever earthquake of that magnitude overall i would recommend this hotel kids had great time at the pool as well as visiting universal studio hollywood;5

me and my partner have just returned from a 2 night stay in riad kheirredine and i cannot wait to go back i was a little dubious at first as the riad is tucked away in the winding streets away from the main areas cars do not go to the door you get dropped off to a particular point in the taxi then a staff member will escort you to the riad about a 510min walk however once you have been to the market and the square the location is a welcome relief from all of the hustle bustle and noise as soon as we entered the property we were pleasantly surprised at how this beautiful building manages to hide behind a simple unassuming door every part of the riad is elegant and we were greeted with breakfast in one of the courtyards the staff are incredible every single;5

i stayed here on the night of november 13 the remodeled property is fine in all respects and i will definitely return when connecting through lax i did however have one remarkable interaction with a hotel staff member which is worth noting on ta when i started to get dressed in the morning of the 14th i noticed that a pocket on my trousers was badly torn probably from getting caught on an airplane armrest upon discovering this i called the hotel switchboard to determine if there might be a way to have the pants mended the operator laura without hesitation told me that she would personally take care of this for me and arranged to have a bellman pick up the pants within 45 minutes i had the sewn garment back and i was ready to go fantastic;5

if you want to be in the center of activity while also having the most charming atmospheric place to lounge reflect converse and eat fantastic food the riad kheirradine is where you should stay in marrakech a few highlights from our december 2019 trip the level of service was so extraordinary here i was surprised to find out the owner lived in italy and only visited periodically the attention to detail was to a degree that i would have associated with a hawkeyed owner constantly on the premises although the riad is not large the architecture consists of lots of interconnected spaces on different levels that create a feeling of variety and unfolding adventure much like the medina that the riad is within as much as we loved exploring marrakech we looked;5
wow we did not expect the reception we received but were pleasantly surprised not only did the front desk staff spend time finding us a room that met our expectations but they called to make sure we were satisfied not once not twice but 3x this hotel has a staff that enjoys their jobs so much so that the housekeeping staff refused a monetary tip and i quote it is a pleasure just to serve you where do you get that kind of service ever now this is an historic hotel the rooms can be small if you are not using the guide provided by the hotel the hotel lets you know out in front the square footage of each room the staff will work with you to find the best option for your stay and help you get an amazing view of the manhattan skyline we already started looking;5
went to ny with 3 friends we shared a room with 2 beds and it was amazing the hotel is very clean beds are comfortable rooms with an amazing view the decoration is cool bathrooms are a little small but its ok the price we payed was very low compared to other hotels nearby it is located near times square you can easly go there walking also the dinner downstairs has delicious food i dont advise buying vouchers to the hotel breakfast because they only serve toasts juice and coffee a breakfast when you need to discover all that ny has to offer needs to be more complete lol still nothing bad to say about it loved it;5
this hotel is oh so lovely i am an 19 year old ex new yorker and was just looking for a place to stay in the village without crashing a friends studio and the jane did just the trick yes the rooms are the size of my walkin closet yes the bathrooms are shared but its okay because eveything is clean privateand the showers are fantastic in a place this charming the size becomes unimportant especially because theyve provided plenty of clever storage the staff is friendly and extremely helpful cafe gitane in the lobby is fantastic and the pm noise level wasnt as bad as i was expecting most of the other visitors seemed to be rather young and also very familiar with the city stay here with minimal expectations and you will be very pleased i promise;5
staff all really helpful and friendly restaurant lovely room 27th floor was large clean and quiet ask for a fridge to store watermilk buy in 711 around the corner we were quoted â¬20 for duration really good value i thought but no charge on checkout great spot in midtown manhattan as a base stones throw from empire state madison sq gardens macyâs and very walkable distance to key attractions central park natural history museum broadway times square madame tussaudâs bryant park intrepid museum grand central terminal top of the rock with the exception of downtown 911statue of liberty ellis island brooklyn bridge financial district but suggest you take 20 min walk and get a water taxi thead there for a day out great fun and very reasonable;5
the staff was greatthe whole weekend was great we couldnt have asked for a better stayif you go to new york you should stay at the empire hotelsean and the whole staff made us feel at home;5
with our redeye getting us into nyc at 6am we were not expecting but was very surprised and pleased to find they had set our room aside for us for early checkin the night manager had noticed our request and was able to make the arrangement we were in town for a performance at the met that night and it was great to get a few hours of sleep thanks for that kindness the room was on the smaller side but wed stayed in many smaller ones in london an other cities it compared very well no complaints the bed one of the most comfortable hotel beds wed ever slept in no kidding staff was very courteous professional and helpful just dont have anything but compliments about the empire for the cost in nyc at this great location would definitely make this my;5
this hotel was great miriam was so wonderful she really took care of us and made sure that we were well taken care of;5
we so love this area if we could live here we would move to nyc the next best thing to moving is the empire hotel it used to be a dump and has been transformed into a trendy boutique hotel being an old hotel the rooms are small we take a jr suite for the extra space standouts for me are the clever way they transformed long narrow hallways into a walk in the forrest biggest jokethe shower designwise the hotel is gorgeous including the rooms but the shower is a challenge i want to strangle the designer every time i take a shower you see its all about style wo substance although there is nice storage in this bathroom teak floors in the shower nice rain shower head on the ceiling that drips on my hair not nice men love it it has a hand held;5
we had a great five nights stay with an amazing view of the empire state building we were celebrating my partners 30th and we received an upgrade and a bottle of champagne the lady who checked us in was so friendly and couldnât help us enough great location and the most comfy beds highly recommend;5
centrally placed between times square and central park and near many places of interest this has to be one of the best positioned hotels in new york in the heart of the theatre district the atmosphere around the hotel is exciting the staff are really welcoming and are always helpful majid on the front desk was a gem and a credit to the hotel our booked class of room was not available on arrival but it was sorted out without fuss the following day with our bags transferred to an excleent room on floor 12 the rooms are modern and well equipped with everything you need but the ac unit was noisy having the safe on the floor of the wardrobe is secure but not the most convenient place we will be staying there again on our next visit ther are lots of good places to eat are;5
right from the moment we stepped in to our last day the riad kheirredine team made us feel at home jonathan valentina and wafa rocked and abdul and the other hosts at the restaurant provide an amazing level of service waking up every day to a fresh warm and wonderful breakfast soaking up flavors of morocco from the roof top terrace cabana an amazing dinner spread what not these guys are the best and you cannot ask for a better experience if you are looking for a stay at marrakech rich in moroccan flavor;5
after a long trip to get to ny and looking it mohammed at the check in desk was just super gracious in finding me a room even though it was before standard check in time his recognition of my need at the moment had him going above and beyond to take care of a guest cant thank him enough for the excellent service even called the room to make sure everything was to my liking;5
for all the beauty this riad beholds absolutely stunning its the team and we emphasise team because they truly are the ones to make this place special from airport pickup to breakfast on the roof terrace in any one of many stunning spots they have delicately designed you will be wowed by how attentive thoughtful insightful knowledgeable and caring the staff are our time away couldnt have got off to a better start we were half expecting for this to taper off a little as we were new guests but it didnt the selfless and caring attitude became a theme for our minimoon we were given the tour a mobile phone incase we got lost the option of a guide to show us key spots maps taxis arranged you name it they sort it all for you water is also complimentary;5
we are 2 friends travelling from the uk and the ameritania has been a home away from home for a full week we were welcomed by the amazing jeff for whom nothing is too much trouble our room was clean and comfortable with super cozy beds air con and a great view of the city considering it is so central it is still quiet at night and we slept well note there are no food or drink facilities in the hotel but the ladies at starbucks opposite looked after us all week as two women travelling together we felt safe here comfortable and well looked after the ameritania is a fantastic find and one that truly added to our holiday;5
pil very helpful and great service girls weekend out the hotel serviced us very well definitely not what we expected few homeless outside so we were a bit worried but pil looked out after us and gave us the best service ever;5
i have previously stayed in marrakech and did not have nowhere nearly as wonderful experience as i had here from the moment we arrived there on an early flight they gave us breakfast a phone to contact them 24 hours a day should we get lost we got guided into the souks on the first day so we had a good sense of direction and overall the experience here could not have been better i would definately come back and stay here next time i come to marrakech i can see why they are sitting at number 2 spot on trip advisor thank you so much for such a great stay;5
just got back from a long weekend at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone as it is in a great location is very clean and tidy has friendly and professional staff and good food would definately stay there again;5
jeff was always very hospitable and helpful during my stay he was a positive persona that helped me get settled for my three day stay at your hotel as a result i will book future dates jeff is a positive attribute of this establishment;5
ive just come back from staying at riad kherirredine with a fellow friend both our first times in marrakesh and has by far been the best holiday staying at the riad was an exceptional experience and we absolutely cannot fault our entire stay from the welcome email prior to the holiday commencing to the final consultation before our departure for the airport our experience was completely customer servicesatisfaction orientated there was nothing that was ever too much for each and every staff member which is completely rare within this present day i dont want to spoil the experience for any potential future individuals who plan to seek the same experience at riad kheirredine all i will say is you will be delighted with your stay and its the little things such as;5

we only spent 3 nights at riad kheirreidine but it felt like a dream their welcome was super nice warm and personal and also during our stay they always showed honest interest in us the service was on point all the stuff was extremely nice and polite and open for some jokes we really felt super welcome also the riad lies directly in the medina also not far away from the yves saint laurent museum if you want you can get a guide from the riad to bring you to certain points this was a service that we really loved because the medina can appear as a labyrinth first anyway we had a wonderful and unforgettable time there and will for sure come back someday;5
stayed at the empire for a couple nights back in jan 14 notes nick who checked us in was extremely helpful it was later on a sunday night and we were hungry he knew quite a few spots that served late and hooked us up maybe ask for a room that views lincoln center the lobby bar is sweet has a very classic hollywood vibe the bartender was a true gentleman i wanted a manhattan to take up to the room he poured it into a rocks glass and gave me an up glass with a cherry for when i got to the room and when i poured it it was to the rim well done didnt make it to the chowder house you can access it from inside the hotel but it looks solid nice bar for those of us who only eat at the bar had a great meal at the smith across the way new american;5
i booked this hotel for the quick trip to universal studios for halloween horror nights i flew into bob hope burbank airport it was about a 15min drive to the hotel which i took a cab and the fare came out to be 2600 with tip checkin was painless got my room key and was placed on the 8th floor facing the freeway which had no noise from the outside traffic view was as expected for being in southern cal and had a partial view of the universal studios along with a view of universal city walk getting to the studios was maybe a 5min walk from the hotel you do have climb up a hill and cross a pedestrian bridge to get to the park but it was very convenient after returning from universal i was pleased to find out that the bed was very comfortable and very hard to get out of;5
had a great stay the location was perfect everything was in walking distance hotel was very clean and we felt very safe in and around the hotel we loved looking out the window and seeing the empire state building;5
we didnt have any expectations before arriving we expected another hotel amongst the hundreds we have stayed at but this was really something else the location in the heart of the old city is romantic and exotic but the thing that really makes the whole thing stand out is the incredible welcome from the staff everyone says that they cant do enough for you but few people comment on the charming informality of everyone everyone knows who you are there is no question of having to sign for everything you want and the service is always impeccable we have travelled extensively in the middle east but i can imagine that some visitors feel intimidated by the arrival with the taxi having to stop several hundred metres from the riad with the rest of the journey made on foot;5
the hotel and staff are amazing the building is just beautifully preserved in 1920s art decor and the staff are politehelpful and appreciative all amenities were close buy walking to macy and time square is quick and easy;5
first time staying at county hall and will definitely return location was perfect for exploring on foot and london was buzzing with visitors but location is really quiet big hotel which is run really efficiently by professional and friendly staff breakfast was busy but food was regularly replenished did not eat there in evening because there are lots of restaurants and bars nearby the lounge was a nice environment in the evening for drinks;5
we booked a queen standard room and were in room 524 this room was amazing compared to our friends who got upgraded from their standard queen rooms to king rooms we had a full size tub and rain shower tub was large enough for me to take a bath in after a long day of walking around the city we had a wet bar area sitting area with a couch and two chairs as well as our bed and a walk in closet a huge surprise after seeing our friends rooms which were also nice but no tub or sitting area highly recommend this hotel wasnt too pricey for nyc on a weeknight in the offseason room was clean staff were courteous and there are plenty of good eats and shopping near by or the doormen will hail you a cab;5
couldnât be a better location for a show at msg than the art deco style new yorker super convenient too if you are taking the train or driving garage a half block away rates reasonable recommend upgrading room size because space is small especially the bathroom room was clean some aspects could benefit from upgradescosmetic refresh hotel boasts a fitness area 3 restaurants steakhoue italian and diner coffee shop within and several across the street recommend gregoryâs would stay here again for another show at the garden;5

i had a lovely stay at hilton universal the staff were extremely helpful and polite and would go above and beyond after a flight from australia i very much appreciated an early checkin and upgraded room the executive room provided a fantastic wrap around room and view of universal and the hills the bed was devine incredibly soft and plush the bathroom was huge with a separate primping section for makeup application cafe sierras breakfast provided extensive options from fruits to pastries and hot breakfast and for 23 filled me up until dinner would recommend anyone looking for a safe secure area to stay when visiting la not just universal the metro is a short walk as well as many shuttle bus services to citywalk;5

letâs start with the arrival it was our first time in marrakech walking through the medina was both chaotic and beautiful we were glad to have the help of the bell boys who navigated us through the streets as they became narrower and narrower the moment we walked into riad kheirredine we were greeted with the smell of roses weâre not joking it smells amazing amal then walked us over to a poolside couch where she had lemonade figs and walnuts to recharge us after our long day of traveling we couldnât stop smiling the contrast between the medina and this oasis was something weâll never forget next amal went through our itinerary daybyday before we arrived amal and the rest of the staff had been instrumental in helping us plan as well as booking the guides and;5

i canât say enough positive things about the riad kheirredine in marrakech we spent three nights at the riad in september of 2017 in the eucalyptus suite it was our first time in morocco and the staff did everything possible to ensure a relaxing safe and unforgettable experienceâ i had done a lot of research and read countless reviews on tripadvisor about the different riadâs before we decided on this one the overwhelming amount of praise led us to book and i am so glad we did the riad went above and beyond what we expected riad kheirredine offers its guests beautifully decorated rooms many amenities awesome food a local cell phone and incredible rooftop views but what makes this such a great place to stay is the extremely hospitable staff all of the employees;5

i have stayed in a lot of hotels in nyc for work and leisure and this is hands down the best hotel in the price range the staff were all really friendly and accommodating the hotel is older but it has a cool art deco vibe to it the rooms are immaculately clean which honestly in new york is rare dont get me started with the horror story of a bed i got at the w times square a few years ago the beds are really comfortable there is ample storage we were in town for the phish shows at msg there were tons of phans partying and having a good time but you couldnt hear anything room to room great insulation oh and the air conditioning is amazing rare in nyc yes the rooms are smaller but if you have ever been to nyc you know that is the case everywhere these;5
we loved loved loved this hotel all staff from the front desk to the cleaning staff and food preparation staff were all extremely friendly pleasant mannered and helpful when questions were asked of them breakfast was included and there was plenty to choose from would highly recommend this hotel to stay at room and all amenities were kept of high standard the subway was just across the street and down a 12 a block and was very easy to use to get downtown and uptown the only thing that we thought would have been handy was for the hotel to have a restaurant as if it had of had one we most likely would have eaten there every night as there was not many places to eat out at within the area only fast food places but overall this would not stop us staying here again;5
just back from ny having spent 4 nights at the ameritania comfortable clean and really great location for exploring couldnât have wished for better great advice if required from all the staff particular mention to julian and jeff always willing to help fab;5

my two children ages 9 and 12 and i recently returned from marrakesh the idea of travelling to morocco was to experience a completely different culture and environment as compared to my own as the trip grew closer i realized it was also pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone particularly because of the political climate we live in nowadays the riad kheirredine created a calm peaceful and welcoming environment for us to fully enjoy and experience marrakesh we could not have stayed in a better place upon arrival we were picked up at the airport by a kind gentleman from the riad we were taken to the riad and met with valentina we were offered mint tea dates and apricots and received a full run down of the riadmeals services etc we received our phone;5
the location is excellent penn st the history of this hotel is capturing n tesla lived here for 10 years but most of all its cozy comfortable and very very friendly tons of places to grab a meal around and in the hotel itself close to everything i landed at newark airport and in 40 minutes i was across the hotel at penn station the place is quiet when you need it in the rooms and buzzing on the streets around like i said in the title i love this hotel it was my first time and definitely not the last btw love the splendor and the decor of the rooms and the stuff is super friendly;5

this really is worth splashing out on obviously you can get cheaper but when considering what it would cost to stay in a western type hotel just outside the medina there is no comparison we chose one of the two imperial suites and we loved it the complimentary breakfasts laundry and mobile phones in case you get lost are some of the great extras the slight moan is that our suite did experience some noise coming from the dumb waiter taking food up and down from the roof terrace;5

from the moment i stepped into the lobby it was as if i had gone back in time this hotel is so unique in its appearance and is very authentic in its history the minute i stepped out of the cab there was someone there to take my suitcase up the stairs check in was a breeze and i was even able to check in early the room although even smaller than i imagined was perfect as all i needed was a clean and quiet room to sleep while staying in nyc for a conference it was the weekend of the nyc marathon and rooms were tough to come by and outrageously overpriced not the jane hotel it was a bargain and well worth every dollar sharing a bathroom with other guests on the floor was no problem never had to wait to use either the toilet or shower i enjoyed my stay there in;5
we stayed at hilton universal as a family of 4 this wasnt the cheapest hotel to book but by the time you include transport to and from universal studios daily as we bought a weeks pass for the price of a 2 day pass its well worth the extra money our 2 teenagers were in their elementeach morning they would get up catch the free shuttle outside the hotels front door travel to universal walk for some breakfast then go to universal studios for the day they often hopped out for lunch again to universal walk as there are many cheap options or even for a dip in the hotels pool then back to universal studios for more fun rides and shows then we would all meet at johnny rockets for dinner then back for the night lights at universal to top off a great day free shuttles;5

i visit nyc about 23 times each year this visit was just my niece and myself so we decided to take a chance on the jane i was very nervous about this visit however i am absolutely thrilled with this cute little hotel yes the room is small and it is somewhat difficult for two people to move around in the room however once you get the hang of it its really no problem at all it was very much like my college dorm but cleaner and quieter the bathroom was very clean and even though this was a busy time i never waited for a toilet or shower my only complaint is the male guests who think it is ok to go into the bathroom wearing their boxers or tighty whities the hotel rooms comes with a nice bathroom guys use it no one wants to see you in your;5
i visited here two years ago and i loved my stay i needed a last minute room and when i called thankfully they had a room available the room was spacious and cozy the club on the rooftop was also great being that it was a friday night the line was pretty long to get in but because i was a guest i did not have to wait on it the staff was courteous and polite xnachy from the front desk took wonderful care of us just like the last time i visited i cannot wait to return;5
just back from a weeks stay at the lovely empire hotel arrived in nyc during a storm on 4th july to be advised we had been given a free upgrade but unfortunately our room wasnt ready due to late checkouts because of the weather no problem our luggage was stored and we went next door to starbucks for a drink and some people watching returned to hotel 30 mins later to be advised our room still wasnt ready by this time it was after 4pm and we were given vouchers for free drinks in the stunning lobby bar after our cocktails our room number 715 was finally ready and didnt disappoint it was described as a superior double double but was more like a mini suite with a separate seating area 2 large double beds walk in wardrobe and a mini fridge which we were told we could;5

we can 100 recommend riad kheirredine without reservation riad kheirredine is located in a quiet residential area within the median and difficult to find however we had transportation arranged by the riad recommendation here and this worked like clock work our driver was exactly where we were to meet him at the airport and staff were on hand at the taxi drop off point to take our cases to the riad an effortless transfer on venturing out anyone will find it difficult at first to find their way back to the riad but donât be put off by this as you will be given a local mobile to phone for assistance and staff are readily at hand to walk you to your destination or bring you back home however on our second day we got the lie of the land and to be honest all the;5

susie the concierge was amazing we wanted to find a place in manhattan that served crab legs it took a little while but she found it and it you have the chance the city crab shack on 16th and 5th is amazing;5
the title of my review really says most of what i wanted to express the new yorker is an iconic manhattan hotel i would be disappointed at having to stay anywhere else except maybe the waldorf astoria the thing that makes this hotel so appealing is its history and design it is a hotel for the people at very affordable prices but with service and pedigree second to none please do your research before you stay here and understand how significant this place is its an artdeco masterpiece with rooms dedicated to the geniuses muhammad ali and nikola tesla who both stayed at this hotel ali ti recuperate after his fight with frazier at madison square garden just across the street on the corner of 34th and tesla who lived in room 3327 for ten years until he died;5

loved the location hip bar and lobby scene super comfy beds good restaurants within walking distanceâ¦but my favorite was the whole foods in the time warner building the staff was very helpful easy to get transportation;5
itâs rare to find hotels that match up to the hype and photos presented by the hotels themselves but this one did big time if youâve been to nyc you will know that hotel rooms often arenât bigger than a walkin closet with views of a brick wall or alley dumpster not this place big spacious rooms ridiculously comfortable bed and bedding and the bathrooms are stunning clean modern and within steps of the late show itâs an outstanding option to anyone visiting nyc would definitely book again and again;5
our first time in marrakesh and the staff were brilliant and went the extra mile to make our stay memorable we could not have got round the souk and the labyrinth of alleyways without the mobile phone and guidance provided by the riad every morning we were greeted by the helpful staff who helped us to plan our day and organise a restaurant in the evening it was ramadan during our break which was interesting to observe the importance of this religion to the people;5
thank you for everything everything was perfect food was great the staff was amazing very warming kind helpful the hotel was great breakfast is outstanding we will be back for sure also the rooms are magnificent;5
i was a bit weary with this hotel at first but man was i wrong yes the rooms are small that being said who goes to nyc to stay in their hotel room not me i stayed with two girlfriends and had a blast the front desk is a bit short on the phone but they are helpful we called down for ice several times during our stay and it was delivered promptly this hotel is right on central park literally just cross the street it is also close to two subway stations i will definately be staying here again;5
the ambience of the empire hotel is absolutely stunning my son is at juilliard and the location of the hotel across from lincoln center is ideal i also want to remark on the extraordinary professional and welcoming staff from the complimentary fiji water to the glorious rooftop pool lounge and restaurant the empire hotel is a rare gem;5
gabriel and staff could not have been more accommodating very friendly informative and helpful they actually seemed genuinely grateful and happy that i chose the empire hotel i will definitely stay at the empire on a return trip;5
stayed here for 5 nights it was great good location nice room free upgrade lovely friendly helpful staff the breakfast in the hotel was expensive there was a nice restaurant close by at half the price and better food would definitely stay here again xx;5
the empires great staff is very attentive to the needs of their guests from jose at the reception desk to the front door staff to the housekeepers everyone is pleasant polite and accommodating when in nyc we usually spend a lot of our time downtown but the rates location and staff at the empire make it hard not to stay there and the subway is close so even going out to brooklyn is easy plus the proximity of the park the upper west side and the beacon theater make it an ideal weekend location we always find our way back;5
after searching for a room in manhattan i came across the reviews for the new yorker and so glad i did making online reservations thru tripadvisor was a breeze checkin on a sunday afternoon took no time at all lynn at the desk upgraded our reservation to a larger room with a view of the hudson river instead of a view of the next building the room was spacious and clean the mattresses are perfect for me nice and firm the bathroom was expectedly small and has older fixtures and tile this hotel has been around for a while but everything was clean and tidy a plethora of towels was provided the elevators are fast and smooth one very cool amenity that is not advertised is the location of the 74th and penn subway station right across the street i wish i had known;5
updated very cool rooms and common areas great pool can actually walk to the terminals fairly easily the staff must be trainied to surprise and delight because that happened at almost every turn;5
where to start my wife and i stayed at riad kheirredine last week for 3 nights there wasnt one thing that i would have changed this place is one of the pearls of marrakech and its impossible to be in any way disappointed if you choose to stay here we decided to stay in an imperial suite which are the newest addition to the riad you can tell that every detail has been though of when designing the rooms pure contemporary class with a moroccan theme breakfast was lovely and plentiful and could be served at any time anywhere in the riad the 2 pools were intimate but great i think above all it was the service that stood out during our stay all staff members couldnt do enough to help you they were all so polite and you know that they genuinely just want to help you;5
this hotel having 2 side one is main entrance and another is at parking side the pic which i uploaded it was taken at parking side hotel is near the airport and having their shuttle for pick up and drop off to the airport i love here is food they served with best quality specially i like there fried potatoes on the breakfast table we have nice talked with pilots and few crew member generally air peoples are staying here;5
this was the best location to visit and experience nyc most attractions are walking distance away subway station is right outside the hotel which makes it convenient to go almost everywhere we were even able to catch the train to jfk airport without much effort staff is courteous and polite mr mohammed who helped us at the checkin desk helped us with early checkin and gave us a great room with a view on 25th floor facing the empire state building he also checked in with us to make sure we were satisfied with our room cleaning staff made sure we had clean fresh towels and beds every night for our 4 night stay would totally come back to this hotel for our next nyc visit;5
stayed here last month for 5 days with my wife and 4 year old daughter the location is perfect for visiting universal studios and using the hotel for a base to explore la room was the perfect size for the 3 of us the hotel has a fabulous pool and spa area with plenty of lounges to relax on there is even cabanas for rent if youd like a bit more privacy i cant comment on the barrestaurant as we didnt eat there during our stay there is a shuttle bus that runs between universal city walk and the hotel and the sheraton and is every 15 minutes or so starline tours also pick up from the hotel for tours into hollywood and beyond which was extremely handy too my only piece of criticism would be the lack of a guest laundry but not many higher end hotels such as this;5
my husband and i spent three wonderful nights at riad kheirredine from the moment we landed in marrakech riad kheirredine greeted us with open arms and treated as guests in their home upon arrival both ismail and elena welcomed us we had made arrangements for dinner in the medina and ahmed guided us to the restaurant when we had finished dinner true to form we used the cell phone provided by riad kheirredine and ahmed promptly returned to guide us back we spent our first two nights in the yasmine suite situated on three levels this suite is ideal for families as there are two airconditioned sleeping areas and two bathrooms there is also a private deck off of a separate lounge area where you can enjoy a morning espresso or a glass of wine in the evening;5
our room and bathroom were tiny but comfortable and clean perfect location for all we wanted to do very good value the tick tock diner in the lobby is a real plus friendly and helpful staff would not hesitate to stay at the new yorker hotel again;5

as first time visitors to marrakech we had nothing to which we can compare the riad kherreidine but we can say that this is an outstanding small boutique hotel which offers a standard of service and decoration that would be considered excellent in any city in the world the decor is traditional morrocan with hints at modernity which ensure that this hotel feels absolutely at home in the 21st century the staff are outstanding from marco and esmerelda in the front office through khalid as head waiter and the house keeping staff the only comment that we would make concerning the location is that it is a little farther away from the medina than some other hotel 10 mins walk through some of the poorer parts of marrakech but with three children we did not feel;5
we stayed here solely for the convenience of going to universal studios the hotel is lovely and so clean we had a corner king room with amazing views and fantastic layout they had free shuttles to universal which only took about 510 minutes we did not eat at the restaurant the front staff was very welcoming;5

we checked in early on thursday and planned to have the hotel hold our bags while we went to universal studios for the day my daughter wasnât feeling well and stewart the front desk agent was so nice and got us into a room very early so my daughter could rest even though the hotel was very busy he even gave us a couple bottles of water in case she needed them very nice touch the room was very nice we came from disney grand california hotel so the hilton rooms were huge compared to that hotel the bathroom was large and very well equipped and the beds were comfortable my husband and son used free shuttle to universal and took advantage of the hotel getting our tickets for them so they didnât have to wait in any lines at universal the location to the park was so;5

we stayed 3 nights we are 3 ladies in our 60s celebrating a birthday retirement our first time in hollywood this hotel was perfect for us front desk staff was very helpful in guiding us to tours and shopping discovered the lyft service and used it everywhere we went excellent drivers bus shuttle is within walking distance;5
expected to bump into a movie star at any minute landscaping makes you feel you are in an ester williams movie the most charm and best value of any hotel in hollywood ca turner classic movies should do a piece on it other than needing brighter lights in the rooms i couldnt find one other thing wrong with it;5
wow i have booked a ton of rooms and had all different types of service in doing so naida by far has surpassed in understanding caring helping accommodating and just being friendly and kind she cares about the people she serves and goes above and beyond to make you feel important and that your stay and comfort matter there should be more dedicated employees like her coworkers take note thank you for making my booking experience anything but a nightmare i look forward to my stay and dropping in to say hi personally ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»ðð»;5
the new yorker was well situated for accessing the broadway shows eighth ave was well lighted and busy with people so i felt safe walking back from evening performances the room was a little smaller but very clean and adequately furnished i did hear some street noises on the 8ith floor it was nice to have security checking to make sure guests belonged before they let people enter the elevators the tick tock restaurant onsite was open 247 for a quick meal i will certainly consider the new yorker on a future trip to nyc;5
i travelled recently to la with my son and chose to stay at the hilton when in town the hotel is conveniently located just off a major freeway and is 23 minute walk to universals studios amenities at this hotel are very good and the staff make you feel very welcome from the outset my only complaint was the elevators were very very slow as they were being upgraded and many of the staff were on hand to help out with any questions etc which helped the hotel has a medium size pool and jacuzzi spa and a nice bar area to make those lazy days around the pool go very nicely indeed the room was spacious and the cleaner did a wonderful job keeping the room clean and smelling nice all in all we were happy with this choice and will be back;5
i had a comfortable and enjoyable stay at the wyndham new yorker a great hotel in midtown manhattan i attended a convention at javits center and i walked it was so close and the hotel is near lots of shopping and taxi stands everything was easy too find i had a great time in new york;5
excellent location when visiting universal studios the free shuttle is a great bonus being close to the freeway made it easy to get around la our room was clean and spacious a bit more care in vacuuming could be taken the furnishing are getting a bit worn dated the beds were very comfortable room prices are at the high range and there are extra charges for everything parking is extra and bottled water in the room overall the hotel is very good we would stay here again when in the area;5
hubbie had a business meeting in la on thu instead of flying back to the bay area on friday 1 hrs flight away i decided to fly down to join him so we could go to halloween horror night at universal studios having heard about nightmare traffic i went online and used 40000 hilton honor pts to get a standard award night at hilton universal city to avoid the drivingparking issues well worth the points spent website quoted 239 for a last minute booking however we had points to spare checked in at 4pm on friday was told we were upgraded to an alcove room on 18th floor feels bigger than the standard room because its angled as you walk in bed was made and bathroom appeared to have been cleaned but only one towel and missing toiletries housekeeping were still;5
the new yorker is the first hotel we have used in nyc it was recommended to us by a friend due to its location it is really close to penn station meaning train travel from the airport jfk in our case was really simple plus there was no lugging cases round the city as we were in the hotel in a matter of 2 minutes the subway is served by penn station too so really easy to navigate the city the hotel is one of the oldest in nyc but is well maintained and our room 3132 was clean and tidy as were the public areas check in was simple and quick and we were made to feel welcomed there are plenty of lifts and they are split equally to serve the bottom half of the hotel lobby to floor 20 and the top half floor 21 to floor 40 our upgraded room was cleaned on a daily basis;5
amazing place to stay in the more cool area in nyc clean rooms and lovely showers hotel full of life staffs are great the restaurant is so good good food and cool people amazing location high recommended hotel;5
clean smaller rooms in a great location near theater district and subway stops staff was friendly and helpful had to drive into manhattan and they had a parking garage within a few hundred feet that offered a discount for hotel stays saved me 50 for 2 days only thing they could improve was wifi it cost to have it in room and âfreeâ service in lobby didnât work very well i did get a spectrum âhot spotâ signal that i could use to check messages but i would stay again due to location and price;5
mohammad at the front desk is a legend he truly went above and beyond to make sure my kids first visit to the city was a memorable one the location is great for touristy stuff and the hotel room was very clean no complaints at all;5
i have stayed at this hotel many times the doorman have gotten to know me by face they all are great people i showed up a little early but had no problem checking in front desk seemed to be on it more then the past rooms clean location is great easy to get to most subways 2 blocks from 9th avenue with gets you out of the tourist area and to lots of great places to eat;5
we really enjoyed our stay at the county hall premier inn the hotel was superbly positioned for everything we wanted to do everything was just perfect from the lovely greeting we received to the cleanliness of the room really comfortable bed and excellent breakfast the next morning it really could not have been any better thank you;5

i stayed with my daughter in dec 2018 for a second time and during the course of the stay there was unfortunately cause for complaint when i arrived home via email i was dealt with extremely professionally by megan who i believe is a customer service manager she resolved my complaint within two days and is a real credit to your hotel donât get me wrong it is a lovely hotel great location comfortable beds and showing your room passes before accessing the lifts made both myself and my teenage daughter feel safe iâve gone from being unsure about returning again to quite confident that we will thank you from a very happy customer;5
clean hotel room was lovely beds comfy reasonably quite room could hear a few sirens ect staff really good brilliant central location the diner is great not too expensive bar is nice for a chilled out evening drink would stay here again room was large;5
the hilton hotel was fantasticmyself and a friend stayed here in september 2007 we were met at check in by an amazing group of staff who were friendly and very helpful we had booked an executive floor room with two double beds the room was great very big and clean the bathroom was spotless and came with amenities towels and bathrobes upon arrival the room contained a basket with numerous sweets fruit etx which was a nice touch in the evening the hotel provides a turn down service for executive floor guests which was pretty cool considering they leave little bags of mms on your pillow although the room itself was great the hotel is showing its age the lobby was a little dated as were the common areas the lifts were really slow and took there time in;5
